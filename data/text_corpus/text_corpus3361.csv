16805,the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars cov 2 is shed in the feces of infected people as a consequence genomic rna of the virus can be detected in wastewater although the presence of viral rna does not inform on the infectivity of the virus this presence of genetic material raised the question of the effectiveness of treatment processes in reducing the virus in wastewater and sludge in this work treatment lines of 16 wastewater treatment plants were monitored to evaluate the removal of sars cov 2 rna in raw processed waters and sludge from march to may 2020 viral rna copies were enumerated using reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction rt qpcr in 5 different laboratories these laboratories participated in proficiency testing scheme and their results demonstrated the reliability and comparability of the results obtained for each one sars cov 2 rna was found in 50 5 of the 101 influent wastewater samples characterized positive results were detected more frequently in those regions with a covid 19 incidence higher than 100 cases per 100 000 inhabitants wastewater treatment plants wwtps significantly reduced the occurrence of virus rna along the water treatment lines secondary treatment effluents showed an occurrence of sars cov 2 rna in 23 3 of the samples and no positive results were found after mbr and chlorination non treated sludge from primary and secondary treatments presented a higher occurrence of sars cov 2 rna than the corresponding water samples demonstrating the affinity of virus particles for solids furthermore sars cov 2 rna was detected in treated sludge after thickening and anaerobic digestion whereas viral rna was completely eliminated from sludge only when thermal hydrolysis was applied finally co analysis of sars cov 2 and f specific rna bacteriophages was done in the same water and sludge samples in order to investigate the potential use of these bacteriophages as indicators of sars cov 2 fate and reduction along the wastewater treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sars cov 2 covid 19 wastewater wwtp sludge 1 introduction severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars cov 2 is responsible for the covid 19 disease a pandemic declared by the world health organization who in march 2020 sars cov 2 belongs to the coronaviridae family coronaviruses are enveloped rna single stranded and positively charged viruses at neutral ph this family includes other human pathogenic viruses such as sars cov and mers cov covid 19 induces respiratory symptoms leading to a critical disease such as pneumonia in 14 17 of the cases jones et al 2020 besides other symptoms include fever cough dyspnea and gastrointestinal symptoms nausea vomit diarrhea accordingly sars cov 2 rna has been detected in the respiratory tract blood and feces of infected people jones et al 2020 sars cov 2 shedding by infected people has been observed in asymptomatic individuals park et al 2020 patients during clinical symptomatology and after patient s recovery for a mean of 12 5 days and up to 33 days after respiratory samples reported negative results van doorn et al 2020 however the viral infectivity in these samples is still not well understood for instance wölfel et al 2020 suggested that no infective viral particles can be found in patients feces while they were present in the respiratory tract in addition zang et al 2020 demonstrated that sars cov 2 released into the intestinal lumen were inactivated by simulated human colonic fluid and infectious virus was not recovered from the stool specimens of covid 19 patients on the contrary wang et al 2020 and xiao et al 2020 recovered infectious virus from stool samples tested positive for sars cov 2 rna the shedding of sars cov 2 rna in covid 19 patients feces leads to the occurrence of viral genetic material in wastewater the presence of sars cov 2 rna in untreated wastewater has been observed in different studies worldwide medema et al 2020 wurtzer et al 2020 la rosa et al 2020 nemudryi et al 2020 chavarria miró et al 2021 ahmed et al 2020a the measurement of sars cov 2 rna in wastewater may provide helpful information regarding the covid 19 epidemic trends in particular areas lodder and de roda husman 2020 through the approach named wastewater based epidemiology whose application has been suggested for surveillance of previous virus outbreak such as poliovirus bancroft 1957 wiley 1962 a good correlation between sars cov 2 rna occurrence in wastewater and the reported covid 19 incidence has been shown in different areas medema et al 2020 weidhaas et al 2021 peccia et al 2020 zahedi et al 2020 furthermore sars cov 2 rna in wastewater has been detected in areas with low covid 19 incidence randazzo et al 2020 or in wastewater samples collected before the first cases were reported chavarria miró et al 2021 medema et al 2020 highlighting the potential sars cov 2 sewer surveillance as an early warning system peccia et al 2020 although preliminary studies performed by westhaus et al 2021 suggest that wastewater is unlikely to be a major route of transmission for sars cov 2 to humans fecal transmission of sars cov 2 has been suggested by two epidemiological studies kang et al 2020 yuan et al 2020 however the body of evidence is still low and to the best of the authors knowledge there is to date no reported excess risk of sars cov 2 infection in sewage workers improving the knowledge on the fate of sars cov 2 genetic material in wwtps would be useful to better characterize the risk related with discharges to the environment or wastewater reuse lesimple et al 2020 the effectiveness of wastewater treatment technologies in reducing viruses has been previously documented oakley and mihelcic 2019 but information on the reduction of specific virus types such as sars cov 2 is still scarce randazzo et al 2020 determined the occurrence of sars cov 2 rna after secondary treatment but it was not detected after tertiary treatment similarly other authors highlighted the efficiency of disinfection treatment such as chlorination in the inactivation of sars cov 2 collivignarelli et al 2020 considerably less information is available concerning sars cov 2 rna presence in sludge few studies reported the occurrence of sars cov 2 rna in primary sludge balboa et al 2021 peccia et al 2020 besides sars cov 2 rna has been also detected in both primary and activated sludge in different wwtps from turkey alpaslan kocamemi et al 2020 given the widespread detection of sars cov 2 rna in raw wastewaters there is the need for comprehensive studies to understand the role of wastewater treatment in the elimination of sars cov 2 rna and the protection of water bodies receiving the treated effluents the present work reports the occurrence and quantification of sars cov 2 rna along the treatment lines of 16 wwtps in spain and france receiving wastewaters from populations presenting different covid 19 incidence rates data are provided on the efficiency of different water treatment technologies in eliminating sars cov 2 rna also the fate of sars cov 2 rna in sludge lines is discussed 2 material and methods 2 1 sample collection sixteen wwtps 8 wastewater treatment facilities in france and 8 in spain were sampled considering all wwtps jointly their water treatment capacity is higher than 10 million population equivalents samples were taken from mid march until the end of may 2020 at different steps of the water treatment process the characteristics of the monitored wwtps are specified in the supporting information table s1 specifies the water and sludge treatment technology for each monitored wwtp as well as the samples collected at each site overall considering all wwtps investigated in the study 164 water samples were analyzed including 101 non treated and 63 treated wastewater samples originating from primary secondary and tertiary effluents in addition 107 sludge samples were analyzed including 56 non treated sludge and 51 treated sludge samples thickened sludge digested sludge and digested sludge plus thermal hydrolysis for water analysis 0 5 l was collected from the wwtp influents and primary and secondary treatment effluents whereas 20 l were obtained from tertiary treatment effluents influent water was collected with automatic samplers as 24 h integrated samples and the rest of the water samples were collected using grab sampling techniques regarding sludge 0 4 l was sampled from primary secondary and mixed sludge whereas 100 g were collected for solid sludge analysis both water and sludge samples were transported under refrigerated conditions and stored at 5 3 c until sample processing samples were processed within 24 48 hours after collection 2 2 sample processing sample concentration and rna extraction were performed in five different laboratories depending on the sample s origin the samples obtained from the wwtps located in france were analyzed at the lcpme cnrs and university of lorraine nancy france and the cirsee suez le pecq france laboratories while those from spanish plants were analyzed in three different laboratories i university of barcelona spain for samples from the barcelona area ii university of santiago de compostela spain for samples from ourense and iii labaqua alicante spain for samples from alicante sabadell and murcia regions slightly different protocols were followed for water and liquid sludge concentration depending on the laboratory wastewater and liquid sludge samples from the french wwtps were processed according to the paper by bertrand et al 2021 spanish samples except ourense were processed according to hjelmsø et al 2017 finally ourense samples were processed as reported in balboa et al 2021 details on the different processing protocols for wastewater liquid and solid sludge are reported as supporting information rna extraction from concentrated wastewater and sludge samples was performed in each laboratory according to the corresponding equipment manufacturer s instructions briefly rna extraction was done using nuclisens biomérieux kit for those water samples obtained from french wwtps the rna extraction from the barcelona area wwtps samples was done using a maxwell rsc purefood gmo and authentication kit promega for the rest of spanish water samples rna was extracted using qiamp viral rna mini kit by qiagen except for ourense wwtp samples that were extracted using starmag 96 4 universal cartridge kit seegene seoul south korea 2 3 rt qpcr analysis sars cov 2 detection and quantification was done through rt qpcr analysis at the five different laboratories depending on samples origin as mentioned in section 2 2 for the french wwtps viral rna samples were processed with the rna ultrasense one step quantitative rt pcr system kit invitrogen and the superscript iii one step rt pcr system invitrogen on a stratagene mx 3005p real time pcr system agilent the used sars cov 2 related genes primer set included e set developed by corman et al 2020 targeting the envelope protein e and rdrp ip4 set targeting part of the orf1ab developed by pasteur institute paris france who 2020 both genes were quantified according to the method described in bertrand et al 2021 samples from the wwtps at the barcelona area were analyzed using the ip4 e and n1 targets with the rna ultrasense one step quantitative rt pcr system kit invitrogen samples obtained from murcia sabadell and alicante wwtps were processed by an applied biosystems 7500 pcr system using the reaction mix taqman virus 1 step master mix thermofisher 4444436 combined with taqman 2019 ncov kit thermofisher a47532 for the analysis of three target genes orf1ab rnapol s gene n gene finally samples obtained from ourense wwtp were characterized for viral rna determination by a one step multiplex rt qpcr allplex system 2019 ncov seegene seoul south korea the target genes were rdrp n gene and e gene the specificity of the target genes used in each laboratory has been previously reported in bibliography references are described at table 1 for each target gene all target genes had a high specificity for sars cov 2 except for e gene that is specific for sars coronavirus barra et al 2020 therefore to minimize the risk of false positives results a minimum of two out of all target genes used in each laboratory should give positive results to consider the sample as positive for quantification purposes of sars cov 2 genomic copies ten fold serial dilutions of a quantified sars cov 2 rna reference material twist synthetic sars cov 2 rna control 2 mn908947 3 ref 102024 twist biosience was used to prepare the standard curves to compare the cycle threshold ct values obtained in the analyzed samples the highest concentration detected from the different targeted genes was reported for each positive sample to account for role of potential inhibitors blocking amplification amplification controls internal iac or external eac were included in each sample briefly in the case of labaqua samples a fragment of the human rnase p was amplified simultaneously with each specific rna target taqmantm 2019ncov assay kit v1 a mean value for rnase p was obtained by analyzing at least 30 negative samples then an acceptation interval was stablished as the media value of 3 times the standard deviation samples with rnase p outside this interval were considered inhibited iso 22174 2005 regarding the university of santiago de compostela internal control provided by the rt qpcr kit allplex 2019 ncov assay test was used in raw and diluted samples in the university of barcelona laboratory tgv virus was used as well as logarithmic dilutions 1 10 for french samples the estimation of rt qpcr inhibition in the wastewater samples was based on the concentrations of f specific rna phages of genogroup ii frnaph ggii detected by using the primers set vtb4 f gii published by wolf et al 2010 for raw wastewater logarithmic dilutions 1 10 and 1 100 were performed in pcr grade water following viral rna extraction the rt qpcr assay was then carried out on both undiluted and diluted rna extracts the percentage of inhibition was estimated for undiluted and 1 10 samples by taking the concentration obtained from the 1 100 samples as a reference due to the high dilution of potential inhibitors for sludges values of concentrations of frnaph ggii phages were used as quality control to take in account role of potential inhibitors of the sample matrix in addition to sars cov 2 rna f specific bacteriophages rna was characterized in some samples briefly for the frnaph ggii genome the vtb4 fph gii set published by wolf et al 2010 was used with the superscript iii one step rt pcr system with 1 µm of each primer 0 275 µm of probe in 20 µl final reaction volume with 2µl of rna and 0 75 µl of superscript iii rt platinum taq mix on the stratagene system the rt was conducted at 55 c during 20 min followed by an initial denaturation at 94 c during 3 min and 45 cycles including denaturation step at 94 c during 15s hybridization step at 58 c during 30s final cooling is done at 40 c during 30s 2 4 proficiency testing scheme to evaluate the performance of the laboratories involved in the present work and to assess the reliability of the different methods used a proficiency testing pt scheme was performed the test was coordinated by ielab a company accredited by entidad nacional de acreditación enac for organizing pt schemes based on iso iec17043 standard and the cga enac ppi 2020 guide in order to perform the test the supplied material included two homogeneous and stable samples in liquid format 1 ml vial each containing natural sars cov 2 and one plastic bottle containing the matrix 500 ml of secondary wastewater effluent regarding the analysis of the provided sample vials one of them vial a had to be analyzed directly to evaluate rna extraction and rt qpcr steps while the other vial b had to be used to inoculate the provided matrix in this case the evaluation comprised the concentration of the inoculated sample matrix rna extraction and rt qpcr steps all laboratories analyzed the two materials in triplicate providing qualitative and quantitative results the pt scheme data pre treatment was performed according to murtula et al 2012 including i eliminate laboratories reporting false positive or negative results ii make a logarithmic conversion log10 of the results which allows obtaining a gaussian distribution normal and iii detect the outlier laboratories the performance of the laboratories was assessed through a z score approach as required by the iso 13528 2015 standard the z scores were calculated from the laboratory results as follows z x x σ p t where x is the average of the logarithmic values of the results of a laboratory x is the assigned value and σpt is the standard deviation for proficiency assessment sdpa to establish the assigned value the participant s pt results were used murtula et al 2012 sdpa defines the acceptable range variation of the laboratories on each assay in this pt scheme the sdpa value has been fixed to 0 75 log by ielab steering committee to adequate it as much as possible to the fitness for purpose this value was determined considering the standard deviation that is found in the concentration step and in the rt qpcr rt pcr step the z score indicates how far away the score of each participant is from the mean in units of standard deviations and in which direction positive or negative the interpretation of the z score is the following z 2 satisfactory results 2 z 3 questionable results and z 3 unsatisfactory results iso 13528 2015 2 5 data treatment log removal values were calculated as follows l o g r e m o v a l l o g 10 i n f l u e n t c o n c e

sars cov 2 rna in the influent were considered for the log removal calculation effluent concentration refers to sars cov 2 genetic copies l in the effluent of each corresponding treatment step for solid sludge samples the rna concentration was expressed in genetic copies kg log removal was calculated for each day of analysis and the values are presented as mean standard deviation for each treatment analyzed when virus rna was not detected at the effluent of a given treatment a value of 2 logs was used for log removal calculation corresponding to the average limit of quantification of all methods 3 results and discussion 3 1 quantitative detection of sars cov 2 in wastewater samples the performance of the different rt qpcr methodologies applied in the study is reported in table 1 all methodologies provided good performance in terms of the slope of the standards recoveries and detection limits 3 2 proficiency testing for the quantification of virus rna in wastewater the pt scheme included a total of 36 laboratories using a variety of different sars cov 2 rna detection and quantification rt qpcr methods the 5 laboratories participating in the present work correctly reported qualitative results positive negative values besides from the 36 laboratories participating in the pt scheme 19 reported quantitative results in order to evaluate the performance of the participants regarding the quantified results reported the z score was estimated the obtained absolute z score value for all the laboratories involved in the present work was lower than 2 for vial a which is intended to evaluate the rna extraction and rt qpcr steps the same result a z score lower than 2 was obtained also for all the laboratories participating in the present work when analyzing and quantifying vial b which evaluates the concentration process rna extraction and rt qpcr analysis therefore the reliability of the results obtained for all the laboratories and the suitability of their analytical methods for sars cov 2 rna quantification in wastewater was confirmed as established in the iso 13528 2015 standard 3 3 sars cov 2 rna in untreated wastewater and relationship with covid 19 cases the occurrence and concentration of sars cov 2 rna in wastewater are expected to be related with the covid 19 incidence rate in the corresponding area it is hypothesized that the amount of sars cov 2 rna in wastewater is depending on the viral load shed in the corresponding area due to both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases figure 1 shows all the influent wastewater samples collected from the different wwtps in which sars cov 2 rna was either detected filled dots or not detected empty dots and the y axis indicates covid 19 prevalence rate in the corresponding area at the time of sampling besides figure s1 shows the evolution of sars cov 2 rna quantification at the influent of each wwtp over time with the changes in the reported covid 19 incidence values from the 101 wastewater influent samples collected half of them 50 5 showed positive results for sars cov 2 rna occurrence most of the wastewater influent samples 89 5 collected from wwtps located in areas with a covid 19 incidence higher than 100 cases per 100 000 inhabitants presented positive results of sars cov 2 rna the number of positive samples from regions with a covid 19 incidence higher than 100 cases per 100 000 inhabitants was significantly higher than the ones reporting lower covid 19 incidence between 1 to 100 cases per 100 000 inhabitants p value 0 05 chi squared test samples collected in these areas covid 19 incidence rate between 1 to 100 cases per 100 000 inhabitants showed high variability being about half of the samples collected positive for sars cov 2 rna finally no positive samples were obtained when the incidence was lower than 1 case per 100 000 inhabitants however only three samples were characterized under this covid 19 prevalence the evolution of sars cov 2 rna concentration at the influent is represented for each wwtp with the corresponding incidence value at supporting information figure s1 most of the plants showed a decreasing number of sars cov 2 rna copies along the sampling time this decreasing trend could be related in most cases with a decrease in the reported covid 19 cases in the corresponding regions along the sampling period however this trend did not apply to all target sites it is important to note that the testing capacity to report the covid 19 incidence was more limited at the beginning of the pandemic when samples were taken in france and spain for the present study than in the later months for instance the reported covid 19 cases in french regions are explained at the department level which in some cases the disease trend may not be representative of the local variation of the wwtp sanitation area besides some factors could provoke variability in the reported sars cov 2 rna concentration in wastewater for instance in a thorough assessment of uncertainty in sars cov 2 prevalence estimation by wastewater based epidemiology li et al 2021 pinpointed precipitation and the decay in sewers as major obstacles to prevent higher accuracy correlation between higher covid 19 incidence and positive samples in wastewater has been observed in previous studies although high variability in detection has been reported hart and halden 2020 performed a detailed computational analysis showing that the detection limits would range from 1 in 114 individuals to 1 in 2 000 000 individuals spanning 5 orders of magnitude despite the fact that wastewater based epidemiology is out of the scope of this study the obtained results are in line with previous works that indicated an association between health data and viral rna quantification in wastewater medema et al 2020 randazzo et al 2020 weidhaas 2021 to further evaluate the evolution of sars cov 2 rna in wastewater treatment only those wwtps showing positive results in the influent were considered in the following sections 3 4 sars cov 2 rna in wwtp water lines in order to evaluate the removal of sars cov 2 rna in wwtps water lines samples were taken at the effluent of different wwtps secondary treatment which considers the removal of primary plus secondary treatment as it is the most common configuration for wwtps worldwide besides to understand the role of each treatment step few samples were obtained after primary treatment only whereas some of them were obtained after tertiary treatment which considers primary secondary and tertiary treatment figure 2 shows the occurrence of sars cov 2 rna at the different wastewater treatment steps as well as the log removal the common configuration of wwtps primary plus secondary treatment eliminated sars cov 2 rna from the 76 7 of the positive samples occurring at the influent only 7 out of the 30 secondary treatment samples analyzed showed positive results with a virus rna removal up to 1 50 0 80 logs figure 2 table s2 from this removal a significant part might correspond to the primary treatment which allowed to eliminate sars cov 2 rna from the 60 of the positive samples analyzed only 2 out of the 5 samples analyzed showed presence of sars cov 2 rna with a mean log removal of 0 48 1 17 log of magnitude figure 2 table s2 finally no occurrence of virus rna was determined after tertiary treatments 2 samples analyzed achieving more than 1 97 0 08 logs of reduction sars cov 2 rna occurrence was significantly reduced after the water treatment steps however our study showed that about 23 of the effluent samples from secondary treatments were tested positive for sars cov 2 rna previous studies also reported positive samples of sars cov 2 rna after secondary treatments including two wwtps from israel abu ali et al 2020 two wwtps in spain randazzo et al 2020 and one wwtp in japan haramoto et al 2020 on the contrary other studies reported no occurrence of sars cov 2 rna after secondary treatment despite positive samples measured in the inflow kumar et al 2020 sherchan et al 2020 these results suggest that secondary treatments are not able to eliminate sars cov 2 rna in all cases however virus detection after treatment can be strongly influenced by the influent viral concentration as well as by the nature of the secondary treatment applied abu ali et al 2020 detected sars cov 2 rna at the effluent of secondary treatment when the virus influent concentration was close to 6 log copies l a similar influent concentration was reported in one wwtp in spain when positive samples for sars cov 2 rna in the effluent were detected however an additional positive effluent sample was reported in spain when the influent concentration was lower than 2 log copies l randazzo et al 2020 therefore the presence of rna in effluent from secondary treatment has been reported in the literature at various levels of rna concentration at the influent between 2 and 6 log copies l it is likely that the secondary treatment plays an important role in the final sars cov 2 rna elimination rate however the scarcity of reported data on secondary treatment inlet outlet measurements hinders a more accurate analysis of the fate of sars cov 2 rna in this section which would be needed to cope with the potential variability due to the different analytical methods applied or the variation of the wastewater characteristics from the different studies in order to evaluate potential differences in the elimination of sars cov 2 rna within different secondary treatments the three secondary treatment technologies covered in the study namely activated sludge activated sludge plus nutrient removal and membrane bioreactor mbr were compared for each of them the detection occurrence and the log removal of sars cov 2 rna are shown in figure 3 sars cov 2 rna was not detected in 63 6 of the samples after activated sludge followed by clarification 4 out of the 11 activated sludge effluent samples showed positive results detection in the effluent was less frequent in activated sludge plus nutrient removal followed by clarification where sars cov 2 rna was not detected in 81 of the samples analyzed after this treatment 2 out of the 11 activated sludge plus nutrient removal effluent samples showed positive results finally there were no sars cov 2 rna positive samples in the effluent from the mbr treatment 8 samples analyzed figure 3a the same trend was observed when the log removals were calculated for each treatment samples obtained after activated sludge and clarification showed a mean value of 1 03 0 59 followed by activated sludge plus nutrient removal and clarification with 1 37 0 72 and the highest log removal was obtained after mbr treatment being more than 1 97 0 93 log figure 3 table s2 our results suggested mbr as the most effective secondary treatment in the elimination of sars cov 2 rna from the water line however a high variability was observed in the measures presented as standard deviation which may difficult to determine significant differences concerning the efficiency in the elimination of sars cov 2 rna within the different treatments scarce information is available regarding the efficiency of water treatment technologies in the elimination of sars cov 2 for instance positive samples of sars cov 2 rna were observed after conventional activated sludge treatment in three wwtps from germany westhaus et al 2021 primary settling followed by activated sludge treatment provided an elimination rate close to 2 logs for sars cov 2 abu ali et al 2020 which is slightly higher than the one reported in the present work previous studies showed a higher efficiency of mbr treatment compared to activated sludge process in the elimination of adenovirus amoah et al 2020 removal for different types of viruses including adenovirus norovirus and f coliphages during mbr treatment has been reported as being between 2 and 7 logs amoah et al 2020 these results of other viruses elimination rate agree with the ones found for sars cov 2 removal in the present work mbr treatment has been shown to be more effective than conventional sludge with a log reduction for sars cov 2 in a similar range than the ones reported for other type of viruses secondary treatments including activated sludge and mbr can be effective in reducing sars cov 2 and other type of viruses from the water line due to the adverse conditions that viruses are exposed to in these treatments lesimple et al 2020 and because of virus sorption to organic particles and further elimination by settling bogler et al 2020 further virus removal can be achieved by mbr through virus particle retention by membrane and cake layer bhatt et al 2020 in addition to the secondary treatment evaluation our study provided insights on the role of primary treatment only in the removal of sars cov 2 rna as well as the addition of a tertiary process in the water line the obtained results on the primary treatment sars cov 2 rna removal of 0 48 1 17 log are in the range of previously reported elimination for wwtps primary treatment abu ali et al 2021 that observed an elimination close to 1 log whereas no detection of sars cov 2 rna was determined after the addition of chlorination applied as tertiary treatment there is a general agreement that tertiary treatments are effective in the elimination of sars cov 2 from the water lines bogler et al 2020 lesimple et al 2020 randazzo et al 2020 specifically chlorination has been previously determined as an effective treatment for the elimination of sars cov 2 abu ali et al 2020 nevertheless further characterization of sars cov 2 rna occurrence after primary treatment only and the addition of a tertiary treatment should be performed to confirm the insight provided in the present work 3 5 sars cov 2 rna in wwtp sludge lines sludge samples were obtained from those wwtps showing sars cov 2 rna positive results in the water influent samples firstly non treated sludge was obtained from primary and secondary treatments and secondly treated sludge was collected after sludge thickening anaerobic digestion and anaerobic digestion plus thermal hydrolysis figure 4 non treated sludge samples presented a high percentage of sars cov 2 rna occurrence being 83 of the samples positive however a small percentage of positive samples at the influent were negative for sars cov 2 rna occurrence in primary sludge that might be related to heavy rainfall and low solids content in the influent as no inhibition was detected in those samples in the case of secondary sludge the 57 of the samples were positive figure 4a these percentages of occurrence are consistent with the elimination observed in water treatments with a detection in only 40 of the effluents after primary treatment and 23 after secondary treatment this can be explained by the fact that virus particles can adsorb to solids and colloidal material because of the lipid bilayer surrounding the sars cov 2 protein capsid balboa et al 2021 in accordance previous studies have already reported an important occurrence of sars cov 2 rna in primary and secondary sludge alpaslan kocamemi et al 2020 balboa et al 2021 peccia et al 2020 and in some cases with concentrations higher than in water samples which highlights sars cov 2 affinity for solids similarly to non treated sludge thickened and digested sludge also presented a high percentage of sars cov 2 rna positive samples being 69 and 71 respectively in both thickened and digested sludge the reported viral log removal was negative being mean values of 0 47 1 20 and 0 17 0 89 respectively table s2 a negative log removal indicates higher viral rna concentration after the treatment when compared to the entrance the elimination of water at these steps certainly contributes to the increase in viral rna concentration in these matrices previous studies reported an important occurrence of sars cov 2 in thickened sludge and pinpointed it as a hotspot of virus rna in the plant balboa et al 2021 besides digested sludge showed an occurrence of virus rna in a similar proportion than thickened sludge to the best of the authors knowledge no previous information regarding sars cov 2 rna in digested sludge is available previous studies with other human coronaviruses showed the occurrence of these types of viruses in sludge samples after anaerobic digestion bibby et al 2011 bibby and peccia 2013 these results pinpoint that human coronavirus genome can be found after digestive phases in line with the results of the present work with sars cov 2 the only group of sludge samples with no detection of sars cov 2 rna was after anaerobic digestion followed by thermal hydrolysis the high temperatures applied during this treatment 150 160 c saturated steam allowed the complete elimination of viral rna with a log removal higher than 1 69 0 27 therefore sludge thermal hydrolysis enabled a complete inactivation of sars cov 2 and guarantees sludge safeness if it is applied for agricultural purposes 3 6 sars cov 2 and f specific rna bacteriophages load along wwtp processes bacteriophages are commonly used as viral indicators to determine the efficiency of water treatments and guaranty safe water use and reuse withey et al 2005 figure 5 shows the concentration of genome of both sars cov 2 and f specific rna bacteriophages in the wwtp14 this wwtp has a secondary treatment based on activated sludge water was sampled in the influent of the plant and in the effluent after activated sludge and clarification secondary sludge was collected from the activated sludge process figure 5 paired samples were taken from 4 different days in the wwtp target processes the concentration of bacteriophages in the influent of the wwtp was higher than the concentration of sars cov 2 with mean values of 7 80 0 26 log copies l and 4 26 0 56 log copies l respectively bacteriophages presented also a higher concentrations than sars cov 2 in activated sludge although the difference in concentration between both viruses was reduced at this step bacteriophages and sars cov 2 presenting respectively a mean concentration of 4 19 1 9 log copies l and 3 23 0 46 log copies l in this matrix figure 5 table s3 at the effluent of the plant after activated sludge and clarification sars cov 2 rna was not detected in any of the samples characterized whereas bacteriophages were still detected in all of them with a mean concentration of 2 94 1 52 log copies l the wastewater treatment line was able to eliminate sars cov 2 down to below detection limits but not bacteriophages however bacteriophages presented an initial concentration about three orders of magnitude higher than sars cov 2 f specific rna bacteriophages may be valid indicators of viral elimination in water treatment due to its high initial amounts and measurable concentrations after the treatment process nevertheless further studies would be needed to determine the sensitivity of both virus along the wastewater treatment process considering if possible higher concentrations of sars cov 2 in the influent enabling a detection of the virus also in the effluent in order to compare more precisely the reduction of both viruses in the same conditions 4 conclusions wwtps significantly reduced the occurrence and concentration of sars cov 2 rna in the water lines however a complete removal was not observed in all cases in this study after secondary treatment and viral rna could be still detected after activated sludge and activated sludge plus nutrient removal followed by clarification on the contrary sars cov 2 rna was not detected after mbr and chlorination applied as a tertiary treatment sars cov 2 rna was detected in large proportions of all types of sludge including sludge from primary and secondary treatments and treated sludge after thickening and anaerobic digestion these results highlight that these treatments are not effective in eliminating sars cov 2 rna from sludge while only after applying thermal hydrolysis sars cov 2 rna was not detected the presence of virus rna in the analyzed samples wastewater and sludge does not imply infectivity nor integrity further studies are required to estimate the infectious state of the virus in the effluents from secondary treatments and after sludge thickening and digestion to verify whether additional treatments are needed to protect the receiving environments finally f specific rna bacteriophages presented high concentrations at the influent which makes these viruses suitable viral indicators to determine its reduction along treatment processes however further research should be done in order to determine the potential of bacteriophages as indicators of sars cov 2 elimination in water and sludge treatments declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

16805,the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars cov 2 is shed in the feces of infected people as a consequence genomic rna of the virus can be detected in wastewater although the presence of viral rna does not inform on the infectivity of the virus this presence of genetic material raised the question of the effectiveness of treatment processes in reducing the virus in wastewater and sludge in this work treatment lines of 16 wastewater treatment plants were monitored to evaluate the removal of sars cov 2 rna in raw processed waters and sludge from march to may 2020 viral rna copies were enumerated using reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction rt qpcr in 5 different laboratories these laboratories participated in proficiency testing scheme and their results demonstrated the reliability and comparability of the results obtained for each one sars cov 2 rna was found in 50 5 of the 101 influent wastewater samples characterized positive results were detected more frequently in those regions with a covid 19 incidence higher than 100 cases per 100 000 inhabitants wastewater treatment plants wwtps significantly reduced the occurrence of virus rna along the water treatment lines secondary treatment effluents showed an occurrence of sars cov 2 rna in 23 3 of the samples and no positive results were found after mbr and chlorination non treated sludge from primary and secondary treatments presented a higher occurrence of sars cov 2 rna than the corresponding water samples demonstrating the affinity of virus particles for solids furthermore sars cov 2 rna was detected in treated sludge after thickening and anaerobic digestion whereas viral rna was completely eliminated from sludge only when thermal hydrolysis was applied finally co analysis of sars cov 2 and f specific rna bacteriophages was done in the same water and sludge samples in order to investigate the potential use of these bacteriophages as indicators of sars cov 2 fate and reduction along the wastewater treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sars cov 2 covid 19 wastewater wwtp sludge 1 introduction severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars cov 2 is responsible for the covid 19 disease a pandemic declared by the world health organization who in march 2020 sars cov 2 belongs to the coronaviridae family coronaviruses are enveloped rna single stranded and positively charged viruses at neutral ph this family includes other human pathogenic viruses such as sars cov and mers cov covid 19 induces respiratory symptoms leading to a critical disease such as pneumonia in 14 17 of the cases jones et al 2020 besides other symptoms include fever cough dyspnea and gastrointestinal symptoms nausea vomit diarrhea accordingly sars cov 2 rna has been detected in the respiratory tract blood and feces of infected people jones et al 2020 sars cov 2 shedding by infected people has been observed in asymptomatic individuals park et al 2020 patients during clinical symptomatology and after patient s recovery for a mean of 12 5 days and up to 33 days after respiratory samples reported negative results van doorn et al 2020 however the viral infectivity in these samples is still not well understood for instance wölfel et al 2020 suggested that no infective viral particles can be found in patients feces while they were present in the respiratory tract in addition zang et al 2020 demonstrated that sars cov 2 released into the intestinal lumen were inactivated by simulated human colonic fluid and infectious virus was not recovered from the stool specimens of covid 19 patients on the contrary wang et al 2020 and xiao et al 2020 recovered infectious virus from stool samples tested positive for sars cov 2 rna the shedding of sars cov 2 rna in covid 19 patients feces leads to the occurrence of viral genetic material in wastewater the presence of sars cov 2 rna in untreated wastewater has been observed in different studies worldwide medema et al 2020 wurtzer et al 2020 la rosa et al 2020 nemudryi et al 2020 chavarria miró et al 2021 ahmed et al 2020a the measurement of sars cov 2 rna in wastewater may provide helpful information regarding the covid 19 epidemic trends in particular areas lodder and de roda husman 2020 through the approach named wastewater based epidemiology whose application has been suggested for surveillance of previous virus outbreak such as poliovirus bancroft 1957 wiley 1962 a good correlation between sars cov 2 rna occurrence in wastewater and the reported covid 19 incidence has been shown in different areas medema et al 2020 weidhaas et al 2021 peccia et al 2020 zahedi et al 2020 furthermore sars cov 2 rna in wastewater has been detected in areas with low covid 19 incidence randazzo et al 2020 or in wastewater samples collected before the first cases were reported chavarria miró et al 2021 medema et al 2020 highlighting the potential sars cov 2 sewer surveillance as an early warning system peccia et al 2020 although preliminary studies performed by westhaus et al 2021 suggest that wastewater is unlikely to be a major route of transmission for sars cov 2 to humans fecal transmission of sars cov 2 has been suggested by two epidemiological studies kang et al 2020 yuan et al 2020 however the body of evidence is still low and to the best of the authors knowledge there is to date no reported excess risk of sars cov 2 infection in sewage workers improving the knowledge on the fate of sars cov 2 genetic material in wwtps would be useful to better characterize the risk related with discharges to the environment or wastewater reuse lesimple et al 2020 the effectiveness of wastewater treatment technologies in reducing viruses has been previously documented oakley and mihelcic 2019 but information on the reduction of specific virus types such as sars cov 2 is still scarce randazzo et al 2020 determined the occurrence of sars cov 2 rna after secondary treatment but it was not detected after tertiary treatment similarly other authors highlighted the efficiency of disinfection treatment such as chlorination in the inactivation of sars cov 2 collivignarelli et al 2020 considerably less information is available concerning sars cov 2 rna presence in sludge few studies reported the occurrence of sars cov 2 rna in primary sludge balboa et al 2021 peccia et al 2020 besides sars cov 2 rna has been also detected in both primary and activated sludge in different wwtps from turkey alpaslan kocamemi et al 2020 given the widespread detection of sars cov 2 rna in raw wastewaters there is the need for comprehensive studies to understand the role of wastewater treatment in the elimination of sars cov 2 rna and the protection of water bodies receiving the treated effluents the present work reports the occurrence and quantification of sars cov 2 rna along the treatment lines of 16 wwtps in spain and france receiving wastewaters from populations presenting different covid 19 incidence rates data are provided on the efficiency of different water treatment technologies in eliminating sars cov 2 rna also the fate of sars cov 2 rna in sludge lines is discussed 2 material and methods 2 1 sample collection sixteen wwtps 8 wastewater treatment facilities in france and 8 in spain were sampled considering all wwtps jointly their water treatment capacity is higher than 10 million population equivalents samples were taken from mid march until the end of may 2020 at different steps of the water treatment process the characteristics of the monitored wwtps are specified in the supporting information table s1 specifies the water and sludge treatment technology for each monitored wwtp as well as the samples collected at each site overall considering all wwtps investigated in the study 164 water samples were analyzed including 101 non treated and 63 treated wastewater samples originating from primary secondary and tertiary effluents in addition 107 sludge samples were analyzed including 56 non treated sludge and 51 treated sludge samples thickened sludge digested sludge and digested sludge plus thermal hydrolysis for water analysis 0 5 l was collected from the wwtp influents and primary and secondary treatment effluents whereas 20 l were obtained from tertiary treatment effluents influent water was collected with automatic samplers as 24 h integrated samples and the rest of the water samples were collected using grab sampling techniques regarding sludge 0 4 l was sampled from primary secondary and mixed sludge whereas 100 g were collected for solid sludge analysis both water and sludge samples were transported under refrigerated conditions and stored at 5 3 c until sample processing samples were processed within 24 48 hours after collection 2 2 sample processing sample concentration and rna extraction were performed in five different laboratories depending on the sample s origin the samples obtained from the wwtps located in france were analyzed at the lcpme cnrs and university of lorraine nancy france and the cirsee suez le pecq france laboratories while those from spanish plants were analyzed in three different laboratories i university of barcelona spain for samples from the barcelona area ii university of santiago de compostela spain for samples from ourense and iii labaqua alicante spain for samples from alicante sabadell and murcia regions slightly different protocols were followed for water and liquid sludge concentration depending on the laboratory wastewater and liquid sludge samples from the french wwtps were processed according to the paper by bertrand et al 2021 spanish samples except ourense were processed according to hjelmsø et al 2017 finally ourense samples were processed as reported in balboa et al 2021 details on the different processing protocols for wastewater liquid and solid sludge are reported as supporting information rna extraction from concentrated wastewater and sludge samples was performed in each laboratory according to the corresponding equipment manufacturer s instructions briefly rna extraction was done using nuclisens biomérieux kit for those water samples obtained from french wwtps the rna extraction from the barcelona area wwtps samples was done using a maxwell rsc purefood gmo and authentication kit promega for the rest of spanish water samples rna was extracted using qiamp viral rna mini kit by qiagen except for ourense wwtp samples that were extracted using starmag 96 4 universal cartridge kit seegene seoul south korea 2 3 rt qpcr analysis sars cov 2 detection and quantification was done through rt qpcr analysis at the five different laboratories depending on samples origin as mentioned in section 2 2 for the french wwtps viral rna samples were processed with the rna ultrasense one step quantitative rt pcr system kit invitrogen and the superscript iii one step rt pcr system invitrogen on a stratagene mx 3005p real time pcr system agilent the used sars cov 2 related genes primer set included e set developed by corman et al 2020 targeting the envelope protein e and rdrp ip4 set targeting part of the orf1ab developed by pasteur institute paris france who 2020 both genes were quantified according to the method described in bertrand et al 2021 samples from the wwtps at the barcelona area were analyzed using the ip4 e and n1 targets with the rna ultrasense one step quantitative rt pcr system kit invitrogen samples obtained from murcia sabadell and alicante wwtps were processed by an applied biosystems 7500 pcr system using the reaction mix taqman virus 1 step master mix thermofisher 4444436 combined with taqman 2019 ncov kit thermofisher a47532 for the analysis of three target genes orf1ab rnapol s gene n gene finally samples obtained from ourense wwtp were characterized for viral rna determination by a one step multiplex rt qpcr allplex system 2019 ncov seegene seoul south korea the target genes were rdrp n gene and e gene the specificity of the target genes used in each laboratory has been previously reported in bibliography references are described at table 1 for each target gene all target genes had a high specificity for sars cov 2 except for e gene that is specific for sars coronavirus barra et al 2020 therefore to minimize the risk of false positives results a minimum of two out of all target genes used in each laboratory should give positive results to consider the sample as positive for quantification purposes of sars cov 2 genomic copies ten fold serial dilutions of a quantified sars cov 2 rna reference material twist synthetic sars cov 2 rna control 2 mn908947 3 ref 102024 twist biosience was used to prepare the standard curves to compare the cycle threshold ct values obtained in the analyzed samples the highest concentration detected from the different targeted genes was reported for each positive sample to account for role of potential inhibitors blocking amplification amplification controls internal iac or external eac were included in each sample briefly in the case of labaqua samples a fragment of the human rnase p was amplified simultaneously with each specific rna target taqmantm 2019ncov assay kit v1 a mean value for rnase p was obtained by analyzing at least 30 negative samples then an acceptation interval was stablished as the media value of 3 times the standard deviation samples with rnase p outside this interval were considered inhibited iso 22174 2005 regarding the university of santiago de compostela internal control provided by the rt qpcr kit allplex 2019 ncov assay test was used in raw and diluted samples in the university of barcelona laboratory tgv virus was used as well as logarithmic dilutions 1 10 for french samples the estimation of rt qpcr inhibition in the wastewater samples was based on the concentrations of f specific rna phages of genogroup ii frnaph ggii detected by using the primers set vtb4 f gii published by wolf et al 2010 for raw wastewater logarithmic dilutions 1 10 and 1 100 were performed in pcr grade water following viral rna extraction the rt qpcr assay was then carried out on both undiluted and diluted rna extracts the percentage of inhibition was estimated for undiluted and 1 10 samples by taking the concentration obtained from the 1 100 samples as a reference due to the high dilution of potential inhibitors for sludges values of concentrations of frnaph ggii phages were used as quality control to take in account role of potential inhibitors of the sample matrix in addition to sars cov 2 rna f specific bacteriophages rna was characterized in some samples briefly for the frnaph ggii genome the vtb4 fph gii set published by wolf et al 2010 was used with the superscript iii one step rt pcr system with 1 µm of each primer 0 275 µm of probe in 20 µl final reaction volume with 2µl of rna and 0 75 µl of superscript iii rt platinum taq mix on the stratagene system the rt was conducted at 55 c during 20 min followed by an initial denaturation at 94 c during 3 min and 45 cycles including denaturation step at 94 c during 15s hybridization step at 58 c during 30s final cooling is done at 40 c during 30s 2 4 proficiency testing scheme to evaluate the performance of the laboratories involved in the present work and to assess the reliability of the different methods used a proficiency testing pt scheme was performed the test was coordinated by ielab a company accredited by entidad nacional de acreditación enac for organizing pt schemes based on iso iec17043 standard and the cga enac ppi 2020 guide in order to perform the test the supplied material included two homogeneous and stable samples in liquid format 1 ml vial each containing natural sars cov 2 and one plastic bottle containing the matrix 500 ml of secondary wastewater effluent regarding the analysis of the provided sample vials one of them vial a had to be analyzed directly to evaluate rna extraction and rt qpcr steps while the other vial b had to be used to inoculate the provided matrix in this case the evaluation comprised the concentration of the inoculated sample matrix rna extraction and rt qpcr steps all laboratories analyzed the two materials in triplicate providing qualitative and quantitative results the pt scheme data pre treatment was performed according to murtula et al 2012 including i eliminate laboratories reporting false positive or negative results ii make a logarithmic conversion log10 of the results which allows obtaining a gaussian distribution normal and iii detect the outlier laboratories the performance of the laboratories was assessed through a z score approach as required by the iso 13528 2015 standard the z scores were calculated from the laboratory results as follows z x x σ p t where x is the average of the logarithmic values of the results of a laboratory x is the assigned value and σpt is the standard deviation for proficiency assessment sdpa to establish the assigned value the participant s pt results were used murtula et al 2012 sdpa defines the acceptable range variation of the laboratories on each assay in this pt scheme the sdpa value has been fixed to 0 75 log by ielab steering committee to adequate it as much as possible to the fitness for purpose this value was determined considering the standard deviation that is found in the concentration step and in the rt qpcr rt pcr step the z score indicates how far away the score of each participant is from the mean in units of standard deviations and in which direction positive or negative the interpretation of the z score is the following z 2 satisfactory results 2 z 3 questionable results and z 3 unsatisfactory results iso 13528 2015 2 5 data treatment log removal values were calculated as follows l o g r e m o v a l l o g 10 i n f l u e n t c o n c e

sars cov 2 rna in the influent were considered for the log removal calculation effluent concentration refers to sars cov 2 genetic copies l in the effluent of each corresponding treatment step for solid sludge samples the rna concentration was expressed in genetic copies kg log removal was calculated for each day of analysis and the values are presented as mean standard deviation for each treatment analyzed when virus rna was not detected at the effluent of a given treatment a value of 2 logs was used for log removal calculation corresponding to the average limit of quantification of all methods 3 results and discussion 3 1 quantitative detection of sars cov 2 in wastewater samples the performance of the different rt qpcr methodologies applied in the study is reported in table 1 all methodologies provided good performance in terms of the slope of the standards recoveries and detection limits 3 2 proficiency testing for the quantification of virus rna in wastewater the pt scheme included a total of 36 laboratories using a variety of different sars cov 2 rna detection and quantification rt qpcr methods the 5 laboratories participating in the present work correctly reported qualitative results positive negative values besides from the 36 laboratories participating in the pt scheme 19 reported quantitative results in order to evaluate the performance of the participants regarding the quantified results reported the z score was estimated the obtained absolute z score value for all the laboratories involved in the present work was lower than 2 for vial a which is intended to evaluate the rna extraction and rt qpcr steps the same result a z score lower than 2 was obtained also for all the laboratories participating in the present work when analyzing and quantifying vial b which evaluates the concentration process rna extraction and rt qpcr analysis therefore the reliability of the results obtained for all the laboratories and the suitability of their analytical methods for sars cov 2 rna quantification in wastewater was confirmed as established in the iso 13528 2015 standard 3 3 sars cov 2 rna in untreated wastewater and relationship with covid 19 cases the occurrence and concentration of sars cov 2 rna in wastewater are expected to be related with the covid 19 incidence rate in the corresponding area it is hypothesized that the amount of sars cov 2 rna in wastewater is depending on the viral load shed in the corresponding area due to both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases figure 1 shows all the influent wastewater samples collected from the different wwtps in which sars cov 2 rna was either detected filled dots or not detected empty dots and the y axis indicates covid 19 prevalence rate in the corresponding area at the time of sampling besides figure s1 shows the evolution of sars cov 2 rna quantification at the influent of each wwtp over time with the changes in the reported covid 19 incidence values from the 101 wastewater influent samples collected half of them 50 5 showed positive results for sars cov 2 rna occurrence most of the wastewater influent samples 89 5 collected from wwtps located in areas with a covid 19 incidence higher than 100 cases per 100 000 inhabitants presented positive results of sars cov 2 rna the number of positive samples from regions with a covid 19 incidence higher than 100 cases per 100 000 inhabitants was significantly higher than the ones reporting lower covid 19 incidence between 1 to 100 cases per 100 000 inhabitants p value 0 05 chi squared test samples collected in these areas covid 19 incidence rate between 1 to 100 cases per 100 000 inhabitants showed high variability being about half of the samples collected positive for sars cov 2 rna finally no positive samples were obtained when the incidence was lower than 1 case per 100 000 inhabitants however only three samples were characterized under this covid 19 prevalence the evolution of sars cov 2 rna concentration at the influent is represented for each wwtp with the corresponding incidence value at supporting information figure s1 most of the plants showed a decreasing number of sars cov 2 rna copies along the sampling time this decreasing trend could be related in most cases with a decrease in the reported covid 19 cases in the corresponding regions along the sampling period however this trend did not apply to all target sites it is important to note that the testing capacity to report the covid 19 incidence was more limited at the beginning of the pandemic when samples were taken in france and spain for the present study than in the later months for instance the reported covid 19 cases in french regions are explained at the department level which in some cases the disease trend may not be representative of the local variation of the wwtp sanitation area besides some factors could provoke variability in the reported sars cov 2 rna concentration in wastewater for instance in a thorough assessment of uncertainty in sars cov 2 prevalence estimation by wastewater based epidemiology li et al 2021 pinpointed precipitation and the decay in sewers as major obstacles to prevent higher accuracy correlation between higher covid 19 incidence and positive samples in wastewater has been observed in previous studies although high variability in detection has been reported hart and halden 2020 performed a detailed computational analysis showing that the detection limits would range from 1 in 114 individuals to 1 in 2 000 000 individuals spanning 5 orders of magnitude despite the fact that wastewater based epidemiology is out of the scope of this study the obtained results are in line with previous works that indicated an association between health data and viral rna quantification in wastewater medema et al 2020 randazzo et al 2020 weidhaas 2021 to further evaluate the evolution of sars cov 2 rna in wastewater treatment only those wwtps showing positive results in the influent were considered in the following sections 3 4 sars cov 2 rna in wwtp water lines in order to evaluate the removal of sars cov 2 rna in wwtps water lines samples were taken at the effluent of different wwtps secondary treatment which considers the removal of primary plus secondary treatment as it is the most common configuration for wwtps worldwide besides to understand the role of each treatment step few samples were obtained after primary treatment only whereas some of them were obtained after tertiary treatment which considers primary secondary and tertiary treatment figure 2 shows the occurrence of sars cov 2 rna at the different wastewater treatment steps as well as the log removal the common configuration of wwtps primary plus secondary treatment eliminated sars cov 2 rna from the 76 7 of the positive samples occurring at the influent only 7 out of the 30 secondary treatment samples analyzed showed positive results with a virus rna removal up to 1 50 0 80 logs figure 2 table s2 from this removal a significant part might correspond to the primary treatment which allowed to eliminate sars cov 2 rna from the 60 of the positive samples analyzed only 2 out of the 5 samples analyzed showed presence of sars cov 2 rna with a mean log removal of 0 48 1 17 log of magnitude figure 2 table s2 finally no occurrence of virus rna was determined after tertiary treatments 2 samples analyzed achieving more than 1 97 0 08 logs of reduction sars cov 2 rna occurrence was significantly reduced after the water treatment steps however our study showed that about 23 of the effluent samples from secondary treatments were tested positive for sars cov 2 rna previous studies also reported positive samples of sars cov 2 rna after secondary treatments including two wwtps from israel abu ali et al 2020 two wwtps in spain randazzo et al 2020 and one wwtp in japan haramoto et al 2020 on the contrary other studies reported no occurrence of sars cov 2 rna after secondary treatment despite positive samples measured in the inflow kumar et al 2020 sherchan et al 2020 these results suggest that secondary treatments are not able to eliminate sars cov 2 rna in all cases however virus detection after treatment can be strongly influenced by the influent viral concentration as well as by the nature of the secondary treatment applied abu ali et al 2020 detected sars cov 2 rna at the effluent of secondary treatment when the virus influent concentration was close to 6 log copies l a similar influent concentration was reported in one wwtp in spain when positive samples for sars cov 2 rna in the effluent were detected however an additional positive effluent sample was reported in spain when the influent concentration was lower than 2 log copies l randazzo et al 2020 therefore the presence of rna in effluent from secondary treatment has been reported in the literature at various levels of rna concentration at the influent between 2 and 6 log copies l it is likely that the secondary treatment plays an important role in the final sars cov 2 rna elimination rate however the scarcity of reported data on secondary treatment inlet outlet measurements hinders a more accurate analysis of the fate of sars cov 2 rna in this section which would be needed to cope with the potential variability due to the different analytical methods applied or the variation of the wastewater characteristics from the different studies in order to evaluate potential differences in the elimination of sars cov 2 rna within different secondary treatments the three secondary treatment technologies covered in the study namely activated sludge activated sludge plus nutrient removal and membrane bioreactor mbr were compared for each of them the detection occurrence and the log removal of sars cov 2 rna are shown in figure 3 sars cov 2 rna was not detected in 63 6 of the samples after activated sludge followed by clarification 4 out of the 11 activated sludge effluent samples showed positive results detection in the effluent was less frequent in activated sludge plus nutrient removal followed by clarification where sars cov 2 rna was not detected in 81 of the samples analyzed after this treatment 2 out of the 11 activated sludge plus nutrient removal effluent samples showed positive results finally there were no sars cov 2 rna positive samples in the effluent from the mbr treatment 8 samples analyzed figure 3a the same trend was observed when the log removals were calculated for each treatment samples obtained after activated sludge and clarification showed a mean value of 1 03 0 59 followed by activated sludge plus nutrient removal and clarification with 1 37 0 72 and the highest log removal was obtained after mbr treatment being more than 1 97 0 93 log figure 3 table s2 our results suggested mbr as the most effective secondary treatment in the elimination of sars cov 2 rna from the water line however a high variability was observed in the measures presented as standard deviation which may difficult to determine significant differences concerning the efficiency in the elimination of sars cov 2 rna within the different treatments scarce information is available regarding the efficiency of water treatment technologies in the elimination of sars cov 2 for instance positive samples of sars cov 2 rna were observed after conventional activated sludge treatment in three wwtps from germany westhaus et al 2021 primary settling followed by activated sludge treatment provided an elimination rate close to 2 logs for sars cov 2 abu ali et al 2020 which is slightly higher than the one reported in the present work previous studies showed a higher efficiency of mbr treatment compared to activated sludge process in the elimination of adenovirus amoah et al 2020 removal for different types of viruses including adenovirus norovirus and f coliphages during mbr treatment has been reported as being between 2 and 7 logs amoah et al 2020 these results of other viruses elimination rate agree with the ones found for sars cov 2 removal in the present work mbr treatment has been shown to be more effective than conventional sludge with a log reduction for sars cov 2 in a similar range than the ones reported for other type of viruses secondary treatments including activated sludge and mbr can be effective in reducing sars cov 2 and other type of viruses from the water line due to the adverse conditions that viruses are exposed to in these treatments lesimple et al 2020 and because of virus sorption to organic particles and further elimination by settling bogler et al 2020 further virus removal can be achieved by mbr through virus particle retention by membrane and cake layer bhatt et al 2020 in addition to the secondary treatment evaluation our study provided insights on the role of primary treatment only in the removal of sars cov 2 rna as well as the addition of a tertiary process in the water line the obtained results on the primary treatment sars cov 2 rna removal of 0 48 1 17 log are in the range of previously reported elimination for wwtps primary treatment abu ali et al 2021 that observed an elimination close to 1 log whereas no detection of sars cov 2 rna was determined after the addition of chlorination applied as tertiary treatment there is a general agreement that tertiary treatments are effective in the elimination of sars cov 2 from the water lines bogler et al 2020 lesimple et al 2020 randazzo et al 2020 specifically chlorination has been previously determined as an effective treatment for the elimination of sars cov 2 abu ali et al 2020 nevertheless further characterization of sars cov 2 rna occurrence after primary treatment only and the addition of a tertiary treatment should be performed to confirm the insight provided in the present work 3 5 sars cov 2 rna in wwtp sludge lines sludge samples were obtained from those wwtps showing sars cov 2 rna positive results in the water influent samples firstly non treated sludge was obtained from primary and secondary treatments and secondly treated sludge was collected after sludge thickening anaerobic digestion and anaerobic digestion plus thermal hydrolysis figure 4 non treated sludge samples presented a high percentage of sars cov 2 rna occurrence being 83 of the samples positive however a small percentage of positive samples at the influent were negative for sars cov 2 rna occurrence in primary sludge that might be related to heavy rainfall and low solids content in the influent as no inhibition was detected in those samples in the case of secondary sludge the 57 of the samples were positive figure 4a these percentages of occurrence are consistent with the elimination observed in water treatments with a detection in only 40 of the effluents after primary treatment and 23 after secondary treatment this can be explained by the fact that virus particles can adsorb to solids and colloidal material because of the lipid bilayer surrounding the sars cov 2 protein capsid balboa et al 2021 in accordance previous studies have already reported an important occurrence of sars cov 2 rna in primary and secondary sludge alpaslan kocamemi et al 2020 balboa et al 2021 peccia et al 2020 and in some cases with concentrations higher than in water samples which highlights sars cov 2 affinity for solids similarly to non treated sludge thickened and digested sludge also presented a high percentage of sars cov 2 rna positive samples being 69 and 71 respectively in both thickened and digested sludge the reported viral log removal was negative being mean values of 0 47 1 20 and 0 17 0 89 respectively table s2 a negative log removal indicates higher viral rna concentration after the treatment when compared to the entrance the elimination of water at these steps certainly contributes to the increase in viral rna concentration in these matrices previous studies reported an important occurrence of sars cov 2 in thickened sludge and pinpointed it as a hotspot of virus rna in the plant balboa et al 2021 besides digested sludge showed an occurrence of virus rna in a similar proportion than thickened sludge to the best of the authors knowledge no previous information regarding sars cov 2 rna in digested sludge is available previous studies with other human coronaviruses showed the occurrence of these types of viruses in sludge samples after anaerobic digestion bibby et al 2011 bibby and peccia 2013 these results pinpoint that human coronavirus genome can be found after digestive phases in line with the results of the present work with sars cov 2 the only group of sludge samples with no detection of sars cov 2 rna was after anaerobic digestion followed by thermal hydrolysis the high temperatures applied during this treatment 150 160 c saturated steam allowed the complete elimination of viral rna with a log removal higher than 1 69 0 27 therefore sludge thermal hydrolysis enabled a complete inactivation of sars cov 2 and guarantees sludge safeness if it is applied for agricultural purposes 3 6 sars cov 2 and f specific rna bacteriophages load along wwtp processes bacteriophages are commonly used as viral indicators to determine the efficiency of water treatments and guaranty safe water use and reuse withey et al 2005 figure 5 shows the concentration of genome of both sars cov 2 and f specific rna bacteriophages in the wwtp14 this wwtp has a secondary treatment based on activated sludge water was sampled in the influent of the plant and in the effluent after activated sludge and clarification secondary sludge was collected from the activated sludge process figure 5 paired samples were taken from 4 different days in the wwtp target processes the concentration of bacteriophages in the influent of the wwtp was higher than the concentration of sars cov 2 with mean values of 7 80 0 26 log copies l and 4 26 0 56 log copies l respectively bacteriophages presented also a higher concentrations than sars cov 2 in activated sludge although the difference in concentration between both viruses was reduced at this step bacteriophages and sars cov 2 presenting respectively a mean concentration of 4 19 1 9 log copies l and 3 23 0 46 log copies l in this matrix figure 5 table s3 at the effluent of the plant after activated sludge and clarification sars cov 2 rna was not detected in any of the samples characterized whereas bacteriophages were still detected in all of them with a mean concentration of 2 94 1 52 log copies l the wastewater treatment line was able to eliminate sars cov 2 down to below detection limits but not bacteriophages however bacteriophages presented an initial concentration about three orders of magnitude higher than sars cov 2 f specific rna bacteriophages may be valid indicators of viral elimination in water treatment due to its high initial amounts and measurable concentrations after the treatment process nevertheless further studies would be needed to determine the sensitivity of both virus along the wastewater treatment process considering if possible higher concentrations of sars cov 2 in the influent enabling a detection of the virus also in the effluent in order to compare more precisely the reduction of both viruses in the same conditions 4 conclusions wwtps significantly reduced the occurrence and concentration of sars cov 2 rna in the water lines however a complete removal was not observed in all cases in this study after secondary treatment and viral rna could be still detected after activated sludge and activated sludge plus nutrient removal followed by clarification on the contrary sars cov 2 rna was not detected after mbr and chlorination applied as a tertiary treatment sars cov 2 rna was detected in large proportions of all types of sludge including sludge from primary and secondary treatments and treated sludge after thickening and anaerobic digestion these results highlight that these treatments are not effective in eliminating sars cov 2 rna from sludge while only after applying thermal hydrolysis sars cov 2 rna was not detected the presence of virus rna in the analyzed samples wastewater and sludge does not imply infectivity nor integrity further studies are required to estimate the infectious state of the virus in the effluents from secondary treatments and after sludge thickening and digestion to verify whether additional treatments are needed to protect the receiving environments finally f specific rna bacteriophages presented high concentrations at the influent which makes these viruses suitable viral indicators to determine its reduction along treatment processes however further research should be done in order to determine the potential of bacteriophages as indicators of sars cov 2 elimination in water and sludge treatments declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

16806,in this work the novel application of chalcopyrite cufes2 for sodium percarbonate spc activation towards sulfamethazine smt degradation was explored several key influencing factors like spc concentration cufes2 dosage reaction temperature ph value anions and humic acid ha were investigated experimental results indicated that smt could be effectively degraded in the neutral reaction media by cufes2 spc process 86 4 0 054 min 1 at ph 7 1 the mechanism of spc activation by cufes2 was elucidated which was discovered to be a multiple reactive oxygen species multi ros process with the coexistence of hydroxyl radical oh carbonate radical co3 superoxide radical o2 and singlet oxygen 1o2 as evidenced by quenching experiments and electron spin resonance esr tests the generated oh via the traditional heterogeneous fenton like process would not only react with carbonate ions to yield other ros but also involve in smt degradation the abundant surface bound fe ii was deemed to be the dominant catalytic active sites for spc activation meanwhile it was verified that the reductive sulfur species the interaction between cu i and fe iii as well as the available o2 derived from the activation of molecular oxygen and the conversion of oh favored the regeneration of fe ii on cufes2 surface furthermore the degradation intermediates of smt and their toxicities were evaluated this study presents a novel strategy by integrating transition metal sulfides with percarbonate for antibiotic contaminated water treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords advanced oxidation chalcopyrite reactive oxygen species sodium percarbonate sulfamethazine 1 introduction up to date pharmaceuticals residue especially antibiotics have attracted tremendous attention owing to their ubiquitous occurrence and adverse effects on the aquatic environment tian et al 2020 li et al 2020 these antibiotics have been frequently detected in different environmental mediums such as soil wastewater treatment plant effluents rivers and groundwater as well as drinking water wang et al 2020a zhang et al 2020a among antibiotics sulfamethazine smt a typical case of sulfonamide bacteriostatic antibiotic has been extensively employed in human and veterinary medicine li et al 2017 vione et al 2018 the concentration of smt in surface water ranged from ng l to μg l level which may result in a high incidence of antibiotic resistance even at trace concentration thereby posing a great threat to the ecosystem and public health xie et al 2020 yin et al 2018 unfortunately conventional wastewater treatment plants wwtps exhibited poor performance in antibiotics elimination from contaminated water environments it was found that only 30 and 45 of norfloxacin could be eliminated by the activated sludge process in shatin and stanley wwtps li and zhang 2011 in the nitrate anaerobic denitrifying system almost 100 removal of 10 mg l sulfadiazine was achieved only after a long period of treatment 168 h zheng et al 2020 hence it is highly desirable to exploit an efficient method to achieve effective smt removal advanced oxidation processes aops have been recognized as one of the most promising alternative remediation techniques in eliminating these antibiotics due to the efficient generation of reactive oxygen species ros such as sulfate radical so4 hydroxyl radical oh superoxide radical o2 and singlet oxygen 1o2 in these aops peroxides like hydrogen peroxide h2o2 peroxymonosulfate pms and peroxydisulfate pds have been extensively employed as sources of reactive radicals which can be activated by various means e g thermolysis uv transition metals ao and liu 2017 chan and chu 2009 du et al 2018 yang et al 2010 similar to the aforementioned peroxides sodium percarbonate spc na2co3 1 5h2o2 a solid carrier of h2o2 as shown in eq 1 is deemed to be a non toxic and environmentally friendly oxidant with superior stability longer storage time and anti explosion property compared with liquid h2o2 gao et al 2020 moreover its alkaline property rendered the spc based aops with a wider ph range suitability and avoid the undesired acidification of water environments thereby attracting increasing attention fu et al 2016 wang et al 2019 1 na2co3 1 5h2o2 na2co3 1 5 h2o2 several strategies have been developed to activate spc for ros generation including uv zuo et al 2020 transition metals fu et al 2015 discharge plasma wang et al 2018 and biochar hung et al 2020 among them activation by transition metals for environmental remediation have drawn considerable attention for example fe2 catalyzed spc process was applied for the treatment of benzene and sulfamethoxazole fu et al 2015 yan et al 2018 li et al 2019 demonstrated v iv activated spc process displayed huge potential in removing aniline due to the generation of powerful oh o2 and co3 likewise lin and co workers illustrated that ferrocene can catalyze spc to efficiently degrade amaranth dye in water and completely amaranth degradation could be achieved within 80 min lin et al 2017 these successful applications of transition metals in spc activation implied the possibility of using transition metal sulfides tmss based catalysts in spc activation due to their excellent electrical conductivity rich redox sites superior optical characteristics and robust catalytical performance li et al 2021 despite tmss have been widely investigated as heterogeneous catalysts during some chemical oxidation processes e g pms pds h2o2 and o3 based aops they are barely explored for the activation of spc towards antibiotics degradation chalcopyrite cufes2 is one of the most extensively distributed sulfur minerals in the earth s crust comprising earth abundant low cost and non toxic constituents accounting for about 80 of the worldwide copper resource olvera et al 2018 it has been demonstrated to be a versatile heterogeneous catalyst for peroxymonocarbonate h2o2 and pms activation as well as electro chemical advanced oxidation process to degrade organic pollutants barhoumi et al 2017 huang et al 2020 peng et al 2020 xu et al 2019 for instance nie et al 2019 reported that 99 7 of bisphenol a bpa could be degraded with a high mineralization 75 within 20 min by cufes2 pms process due to the enhanced cycling of fe3 fe2 and cu2 cu induced by the reductive sulfur species the n type cufes2 was employed as the catalyst to activate h2o2 towards azo dye orange ii ao7 removal achieving 100 removal efficiency at natural ph within 5 min huang et al 2020 nevertheless in this case the heterogeneous process only contributed to approximately 20 of ao7 removal and the concentration of leached fe2 was up to 6 mg l likewise the concentration of leached cu and fe ions in cufes2 pms process were 3 8 mg l and 1 8 mg l respectively after 20 min of treatment due to the acid characteristic of the reaction solution caused by the added oxidant pms nie et al 2019 although the aforementioned spc based oxidation processes could avoid the undesired acidic conditions and reduce the leaching of metal ions from catalysts these oxidation processes were usually with a high dosage of spc but a relatively low removal efficiency and the mechanism of ros formation was ambiguous to the best of our knowledge no work is available to investigate the feasibility and mechanisms of cufes2 in spc activation for water purification which is expected to be an effective and environmental friendly process for the degradation of antibiotics therefore in the present work the catalytic performance and reaction kinetics of cufes2 for spc activation under different conditions were systematically explored by choosing smt as a model contaminant the available reactive oxygen species for smt degradation and the underlying mechanisms of the cufes2 spc process were disclosed meanwhile the practicability of the cufes2 spc process was evaluated ultimately the degradation pathways and variation of toxicity of smt were analyzed 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents all the chemicals were used as received without further purification solutions were prepared by ultrapure water 18 25 mω cm generated from a water purifier uph ii 10t china the details for chemicals are described in supplementary information si text s1 2 2 experiment procedures all the degradation experiments were conducted in a 200 ml glass beaker containing 100 ml smt solution under constant mechanical stirring 300 rpm and the temperature was controlled at 25 with a water bath reaction was initiated by simultaneously adding predetermined amounts of spc and cufes2 into smt aqueous solution 1 ml of samples were periodically collected filtered with 0 22 μm syringe filtered immediately and then quenched with na2s2o3 solution 50 μl 0 1 m before the analysis by high performance liquid chromatography hplc the initial ph of smt solution was measured to be 5 8 without any adjustment it was worth noting that once spc was introduced into the catalytic process the ph value of the reaction media would rise rapidly to neutral or alkaline conditions and remained relatively stable due to its alkaline and buffering properties regardless of the initial ph value of the solution seen in fig s1 therefore the adjustment of the initial solution ph was fulfilled before adding specific dosage of spc and cufes2 using 0 1 m hcl or naoh if necessary which was able to avoid the undesired acidification of effluent and effectively inhibit excessive metal ions leaching to evaluate the reusability of cufes2 the spent cufes2 was collected by filtration then the obtained cufes2 was rinsed with ethanol and ultrapure water for three times and dried at 60 c under vacuum before next use to distinguish the involved reactive species quenching experiments were performed with the addition of tert butyl alcohol tba furfuryl alcohol ffa phenol phoh benzoquinone bq and superoxide dismutase sod as scavengers all experiments were carried out in duplicates or triplicates and the mean values with standard deviations were presented 2 3 catalysts synthesis and characterization the details of the synthesis and characterization of catalysts used in this study are provided in si text s2 text s3 fig s2 gives the detailed characterization analysis of as obtained cufes2 particles 2 4 analytical method the concentration of smt was monitored by hplc agilent 1260 infinity usa equipped with a uv detector at wavelength of 266 nm separation was conducted on a column c18 column 4 6 150 mm 4 μm and the mobile phase was composed of acetonitrile water v v 35 65 at a flow rate of 1 ml min 1 with an injection volume of 20 μl the details of the parameters of the hplc analysis for other pollutants were presented in table s1 the total organic carbon toc of the reacted solution was examined with a toc analyzer toc vcph shimadzu japan the ph of test solutions was measured by a ph meter phs 3c an ion chromatograph system dionex aquion usa was applied to determine the concentration of chloride ion cl calcium ion ca2 sulfate ion so4 2 and sodium ions na the concentration of total dissolved iron and copper was measured by a modified spectrophotometric method using 1 10 phenanthroline and neocuproine ncp at 510 nm and 455 nm respectively ren et al 2020 the optical absorption of the obtained nitro blue tetrazorium nbt solution was recorded by uv vis spectroscopy shimadzu 2250 at 259 nm to confirm the concentration variation of o2 the concentration of oh was quantified by benzoic acid ba using hplc wang et al 2014 both the bioaccumulation factors and developmental toxicity of smt and its degradation intermediates were assessed by quantitative structure activity relationship qsar using toxicity estimation software tool t e s t version 5 1 based on the consensus method electron spin resonance esr signals were measured by bruker jes fa200 spectrometer using 5 5 dimethy 1 pyrroline dmpo and 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 4 piperidinol temp as trapping agents the degradation intermediates of smt were determined by the high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms agilent 1290 6470 triple quad ms usa and the detailed description was shown in si text s4 in all the experiments the degradation of smt followed pseudo first order kinetic which can be described as 2 ln sm t t sm t 0 k obs t where smt t is the concentration mg l of smt at a specific time t smt 0 is initial concentration of smt k obs min 1 is the pseudo first order rate constant and t is the reaction time the activation energy for smt degradation in cufes2 spc process was determined by the arrhenius equation 3 ln k obs e a r t ln a where e a is the activation energy kj mol a is a pre exponential factor r is the gas constant 8 314 j mol k and t is the absolute temperature k 3 results and discussion 3 1 smt degradation in different processes the degradation of smt was performed under different processes as is evident from fig 1 a only 6 0 removal of smt was observed after 45 min of reaction in spc alone process which may be ascribed to the lack of oxidizing species similarly the cufes2 alone process exhibited passive performance with 28 7 removal of smt in 45 min indicating that self adsorption slightly contributed to the removal of smt remarkably the coexistence of spc and cufes2 achieved a relatively high degradation of smt 86 4 of smt could be degraded in 45 min with k obs value at 0 054 min 1 which was much higher than those in the cufes2 0 007 min 1 and spc 0 003 min 1 alone processes suggesting the activation of spc by the cufes2 fig 1b accordingly the mineralization efficiency of the three processes displayed a similar trend to smt degradation fig s3a where 28 9 mineralization was achieved in the cufes2 spc process which was higher than those in spc alone 2 4 and cufes2 alone 1 0 processes confirming that cufes2 possess the catalytic ability for spc to efficiently generate reactive species thereby promoting the mineralization of smt furthermore the catalytic activities of other catalysts cufeo2 cus and fes2 for spc activation were compared it was found that the catalytic performance of cufes2 particles outperformed the other three catalysts when cufeo2 cus and fes2 were employed for spc activation only about 70 4 28 8 and 29 9 smt removal efficiencies could be achieved respectively the k obs value obtained in cufes2 spc process was about 1 93 6 75 and 27 times those in the cufeo2 spc cus spc and fes2 spc processes respectively fig 1b which hinted that there might be a synergistic effect between cu and fe in the cufes2 spc process and the substitution of oxygen with more electronegative sulfur may be beneficial for the cycling of redox pairs xu et al 2018 therefore the degradation performance of cufeo2 spc process was still lower than that of cufes2 spc process additionally the other three cufes2 peroxide processes toward smt degradation under identical experimental conditions were compared as depicted in fig 1 the removal efficiencies of smt were determined to be 59 6 0 017 min 1 80 2 0 047 min 1 and 62 0 0 027 min 1 for cufes2 ps cufes2 pms and cufes2 h2o2 processes respectively these results demonstrated the decontamination superiority of cufes2 spc process under neutral conditions which rendered huge potential in practical application while the other three cufes2 peroxide processes that inclined to efficiently degrade pollutants under acidic conditions huang et al 2020 nie et al 2019 peng et al 2020 therefore cufes2 spc process is expected to be environmental friendly as it can effectively avoid excessive leaching of metal ions from cufes2 particles under acidic conditions due to the buffering effect caused by carbonate ions along with that the major end products of spc are usually non toxic like co2 h2o and na2co3 3 2 effect of some key parameters the decontamination superiority of cufes2 spc process could be ascribed to multiple influencing factors experiments were further performed to examine the impacts of several key influencing factors i e spc concentration cufes2 dosage reaction temperature ph value anions and humic acid ha on smt degradation 3 2 1 effect of spc concentration cufes2 dosage and reaction temperature as displayed in fig 2 a and f the smt removal efficiency was elevated from 73 4 to 89 6 after 45 min as the initial spc concentration increased from 0 5 to 1 mm and the corresponding k obs value of smt degradation gradually increased from 0 027 to 0 061 min 1 the enhanced degradation of smt at a higher spc concentration was likely attributed to the generation of more reactive oxygen species nevertheless the further increase of spc concentration to 2mm at the given time resulted in a decrease in the smt degradation 26 5 0 006 min 1 since the excessive spc induced a higher level of h2o2 and solution alkalinity which enabled to scavenge oh as described by eqs 4 5 farooq et al 2021 4 h2o2 oh h2o ooh 5 ooh oh h2o o2 the effect of cufes2 dosage 0 1 0 8 g l on smt degradation in the cufes2 spc process was also investigated and illustrated in fig 2b it was clear that the degradation of smt gradually boosted from 52 2 to nearly 86 4 after reaction for 45 min as the cufes2 dosage raised from 0 1 to 0 5 g l likewise as described in fig 2f the k obs value increased from 0 017 min 1 to 0 054 min 1 since more suspended cufes2 particles would supply more catalytic active sites for the activation of spc to generate considerable amounts of ros thereby promoting the removal of smt however further increasing cufes2 dosage from 0 5 to 0 8 g l only resulted in a slight enhancement in smt removal increased by 5 kobs 0 070 min 1 since the excess dosage of cufes2 would cause a deadweight loss of ros and may increase the risk of metal ions leaching thus the dosage of 0 5 g l was chosen as an ideal dosage for the rest of the experiments the effect of reaction temperature on the degradation of smt was investigated as illustrated in fig 2c the results showed that when the reaction temperature elevated from 288 to 318 k the degradation of smx would gradually increase from 77 3 to 91 5 accordingly the k obs value enhanced from 0 038 min 1 to 0 076 min 1 following eq 3 the activation energy e a was calculated to be 18 12 kj mol 1 inset figure of fig 2c which was smaller than the previous reported metal sulfides based aops e g 32 4 kj mol 1 of cufes2 pms system nie et al 2019 40 67 kj mol 1 of cuco2s4 pms system xu et al 2018 and 19 42 kj mol 1 of fes ps system chen et al 2017 the results revealed that the process was endothermic since the catalytic activity of cufes2 enhanced with temperature increase the higher temperature may promote the decomposition of spc and the corrosion of cufes2 thus resulting in an enhancement of ros production rate which favored the degradation of smt the results hinted that the obtained cufes2 enabled to be employed as an efficient catalyst under mild ambient temperature 3 2 2 effect of solution ph it is generally acknowledged that the performance of heterogeneous aops is closely related to the solution ph therefore the effect of solution initial ph phini on the degradation of smt using two different adjustment methods was explored and the results are given in fig 2d e firstly the control of phini was accomplished before adding spc and cufes2 in the smt solution the order of smt degradation after reaction for 45 min was phini 3 1 86 4 phini 4 0 73 3 phini 5 81 31 1 phini 7 1 27 8 phini 9 0 26 2 in parallel the highest k obs of smt removal were also obtained at phini 3 1 0 054 min 1 which was significantly higher than those of phini 4 0 9 0 0 006 0 027 min 1 fig 2f previous studies have pointed out that spc would contribute to the alkalinity of reaction media and result in a buffering effect danish et al 2017 therefore the ph change of the reaction processes was further monitored once the spc was introduced into the reaction solution the solution phs quickly rose from 3 1 9 0 to 7 1 9 50 and then maintained almost constant figs s1 and 2d namely the cufes2 spc process actually worked under neutral or alkaline conditions indicating that neutral ph was more suitable for smt degradation which was distinctly different from the traditional fenton process we further investigated the catalytic performance of the process by pre adding specific amount of spc before adjusting the solution ph results manifested that the satisfactory performance of the cufes2 spc process for smt removal could be achieved in a wide ph range except for phini 10 54 fig 2e the catalytic reaction occurred at a low phini 3 15 would induce the excessive leaching of metal ions 5 89 mg l for dissolved iron and 8 29 mg l for dissolved copper fig s3b resulting in the concern of secondary pollution even the smt was almost completely degraded within 15 min while the metal ions leaching problem can be well controlled by pre adjusting the soultion ph before adding spc and the corresponding concentrations of dissolved iron and copper at phini 3 1 were measured to be 0 198 mg l and 0 211 mg l respectively fig s3c these combined results indicated that the cufes2 spc process was suitable for water purification over a broad ph range to further elucidate the effect of initial ph on the treatment of smt by cufes2 spc process zeta potential of cufes2 was determined as shown in fig s3d cufes2 was negatively charged under all investigated ph values as ph increased to 9 0 and 10 55 most of smt were present as anionic species pka1 2 28 and pka2 7 42 fig s3e and the electrostatic repulsion between cufes2 and smt was expected to weaken the interaction of target contaminants with catalytic active sites thus hampering the degradation of smt chen et al 2020a teixido et al 2011 the higher ph levels might not only lower the oxidation potential of oh but also lead to the self decomposition of h2o2 to h2o and o2 due to its unstable property which was not conducive to the subsequent conversion of oh to other ros tang and wang 2019 besides the strong alkaline conditions accelerated the precipitation of metal ions and weakened the synergistic effect between fe ii and cu ι thus reducing the availability of catalytic sites on the surface of cufes2 which followed the similar trend obtained in the previous reported spc induced catalytic processes farooq et al 2021 sajjadi et al 2018 to balance the costs of post treatment of acidized effluent catalytic performance and metal leaching problem the regulation of ph was fulfilled before adding spc and the reaction media at ph 7 1 was chosen in subsequent experiments 3 3 effect of inorganic ions and nom the ubiquitous inorganic ions and natural organic matter nom that existed in the actual water might present negative or positive effects on the elimination of target pollutants thereby the effects of different kinds of common anions i e hco3 cl so4 2 and h2po4 and ha on smt degradation were studied with detailed discussion in si text s5 fig s4 in short the decontamination capability of the cufes2 spc process was suppressed with the addition of inorganic ions and organic matter to some extent especially in the presence of 2 mm hco3 3 4 mechanistic insights for cufes2 spc process 3 4 1 identification of reactive species in spc activation processes possible ros including oh 1o2 o2 and co3 may be generated danish et al 2017 li et al 2019 therefore quenching experiments were performed to probe whether these active species were generated in the cufes2 spc process firstly tba was employed to assess the contribution of oh k 3 8 7 6 108 m 1s 1 as shown in fig 3 a b when 100 mm tba was added the removal efficiency of smt reduced from 86 4 to 56 9 and the corresponding k obs value decreased from 0 054 to 0 024 min 1 manifesting that the oh did occur in the reaction process via the traditional fenton like reaction eqs 6 7 it has been recognized that spc can be decomposed into h2o2 and carbonate ions and then subsequently may convert oh to other ros gao et al 2020 xu et al 2019 hence scavengers for co3 o2 and 1o2 were selected to further evaluate the possibly available ros as observed the degradation of smt was remarkably decreased by 46 8 upon addition of 50 mm phoh kobs 0 014 min 1 the scavenger of both oh and co3 k phoh oh 6 0 108 m 1s 1 k phoh co3 2 2 107 m 1s 1 and the discrepancy of smt degradation efficiency between tba and phoh confirmed that the co3 was indeed generated in the cufes2 spc process in the presence of 20 mm ffa the scavenger for 1o2 k2 1 2 108 m 1s 1 the removal efficiency and k obs value of smt slightly decreased to 67 2 and 0 035 min 1 while the dosing of 5 mm bq k 0 9 1 109 m 1 s 1 almost completely suppressed the degradation of the smt with a much lower k obs value 27 2 0 006 min 1 which was nearly the same as that of pure adsorption 28 7 0 007 min 1 meanwhile sod another effective scavenger for o2 was further employed to explore the formation of o2 k2 1 2 108 m 1s 1 similar to bq the addition of 0 03 g l sod sharply reduced the removal efficiency of smt which was 6 7 times lower than that of the control experiment no scavenger is present illustrating the indispensable role of o2 in smt degradation these combined results hinted that oh 1o2 o2 co3 were possibly involved in the degradation process 6 cu i h2o2 cu ii oh oh 7 fe ii h2o2 fe iii oh oh to provide direct evidence for the generation of ros esr spectra were recorded using dmpo 100 mm or temp 40 mm as trapping agents as observed from fig 3c the characteristic peak signals of dmpo oh dmpo co3 dmpo o2 and temp 1o2 were detected confirming that cufes2 spc process was a multi ros process with the coexistence of oh co3 o2 and 1o2 which was consistent with the quenching experiments it should be noticed that the intensity of oh and co3 captured by dmpo was weaker than the other two peak signals due to the interaction between oh and hco3 co3 2 which may result in the consumption of oh as described by eqs 8 14 the concentration of oh during the degradation process was monitored as demonstrated in fig 3d the generated oh firstly increased to 292 4 μm within 15 min and then gradually decreased to 53 9 μm when the degradation process was terminated the phenomenon was different from the typical oh dominated process in which the oh concentration would progressively accumulate demonstrating the involvement of other ros for smt degradation ren et al 2020 hence a similar catalytic experiment was conducted in which the smt was replaced by atrazine atz with the same initial concentration atz has high reactivity with oh k atz oh 2 5 109 m 1s 1 but is less sensitive to co3 k atz co3 4 106 m 1s 1 zhang et al 2015 hence if oh would mainly react with carbonate ions to form other ros in cufes2 spc process the degradation of atz could be largely hampered it was found that the degradation efficiency of atz in cufes2 spc process decreased by 43 4 compared with that of smt fig 3d thus the observed peak signals of dmpo oh and dmpo co3 were relatively weak 8 oh co3 2 oh co3 k 3 9 108 m 1s 1 9 oh hco3 h2o co3 k 8 5 106 m 1s 1 10 h2o2 co3 hco3 ho2 11 ho2 h o2 12 o2 oh 1o2 oh 13 ho2 o2 1o2 ho2 14 2o2 2h2o 1o2 h2o2 2oh 3 4 2 role of carbonate ions to further validate the above speculation the role of the carbonate ions in ros evolution in the cufes2 spc process was further validated h2o2 and na2co3 in equal amount to the constituents of spc were utilized to catalyze cufes2 for comparison 92 9 smt removal efficiency was achieved after 45 min of treatment by cufes2 h2o2 process which was verified to be a typical oh dominated process under acidic conditions due to the strong inhibitory effect caused by the addition of tba and the stronger characteristic peak signal of dmpo oh relative to dmpo o2 fig s5a b in the cufes2 h2o2 na2co3 process 84 8 of smt could be degraded which was slightly lower than that of cufes2 spc process fig 4 a the available ros may be altered in the cufes2 h2o2 process due to the addition of carbonate ions as shown in fig s5c about 59 9 68 0 and 38 7 of smt were removed in the presence of tba sod and phoh respectively this result demonstrated the coexistence of oh co3 and o2 which was also confirmed by the esr tests fig s5d likewise the level of oh was found to be negatively correlated with carbonate ions concentration the final concentration of oh declined from 212 3 to 82 76 57 44 and 29 85 μm as the carbonate ions concentration increased from 0 to 0 8 1 0 and 2 0 mm respectively fig s5e meanwhile the excess carbonate ions can act as the scavenger for both oh and o2 zhu et al 2018 the replacement of h2o2 by spc benefitted for the control of effluent ph due to the buffering effect which endowed a wider ph suitability and prevented excess metal ions leaching the ph values during the reaction process always maintained around 7 3 which was in accordance with the status of the cufes2 spc process fig s5f moreover the presence of carbonate ions enabled the generation of diverse electrophilic reactive oxygen species showing splendid reactivity in eliminating electron rich compounds therefore it can be concluded that the generated oh played a dual role in the cufes2 spc process it would mainly react with carbonate ions to form other ros through a series of chain reactions and partially contributed to the degradation of smt due to its limited oxidation potential at higher ph value 3 4 3 role of superoxide radical surface fe and s species in order to confirm the essential role of o2 nbt was selected as a qualitative indicator of o2 as it could undergo stepwise reduction with o2 k 5 88 104 m 1s 1 to form monoformazan cheng et al 2017 as illustrated in fig s6 the maximum absorbance λ 259 nm of nbt dramatically decreased as the reaction proceeded since the nbt can react with both oh and o2 zhao et al 2014 a new maximum absorption was observed at 560 nm suggesting the formation of o2 in the cufes2 spc process since the evolution of o2 was ph dependent and the neutral ph favored the generation of o2 fang et al 2013 besides molecular oxygen was also validated to be an indispensable driving force during alachlor degradation in the fes2 h2o2 process liu et al 2015 to uncover the role of dissolved oxygen in the formation of o2 experiment was performed in deoxygenated solution continuously purged with n2 as described in fig 4b the smt degradation efficiency was decreased by 35 under anoxic condition compared with the control experiment without purging manifesting that molecular oxygen could be reduced to o2 directly by the surface fe ii and cu i of cufes2 via single electron transfer route the standard redox potential for cu ii cu i fe iii fe ii and o2 o2 is 0 17 0 77 and 0 33 v vs rhe zhao et al 2020 respectively which was thermodynamically favorable for the regeneration of cu i and fe ii as expressed by eqs 15 17 it was reported that the spc decay rate induced by cu ii was significantly lower than those of fe ii and fe iii ma et al 2020 thus the cu i cu ii mediated spc activation process was less responsible for smt degradation conversely the surface bound fe species should be the dominating catalytic active sites for spc activation as evidenced by the uv vis spectra recorded in the presence of 1 10 phenanthroline fig 4c a significant characteristic peak of fe ii without filtration at 510 nm appeared during the catalytic process while the absorbance of phenanthroline fe ii peak collected by filtering the reaction suspension before adding 1 10 phenanthroline was almost completely disappeared the results offered direct evidence for the formation of surface bound fe ii which was favorable for the efficient and continuous spc activation 15 fe iii o2 fe ii o2 16 cu ii o2 cu i o2 17 fe iii cu i fe ii cu ii to further verify the above conclusion quenching experiments were performed using 2 2 bipyridine bpy and ncp which would complex with fe ii and cu i on the surface of cufes2 hindering electron transfer to the oxidants fang et al 2020 ren et al 2020 as demonstrated in fig 4d the degradation efficiency of smt dropped from 86 4 to 27 5 and 37 0 in the presence of 2 0 mm bpy and 1 0 mm ncp respectively these results confirmed that surface electron transfer from fe ii and cu i to spc induced reactive species generation in the cufes2 spc process the surface bond cu i was crucial for the regeneration of fe ii on the surface of cufes2 and the existence of surface bound fe ii played an indispensable role in ros generation due to the observed more significant inhibiting effect furthermore the sulfur vacancies were easily formed with the capture of protons by the surface s atoms coordinated to metal atoms which resulted in the exposure of more metal active sites thus boosting the catalytic performance dong et al 2018 ji et al 2021 liu et al 2018 xing et al 2018 esr test was employed to prove the formation of s vacancies during the activation of spc by cufes2 it was evident that cufes2 after the degradation process exhibited an intensified epr signal of sulfur vacancy with a g factor of 2 003 compared with the fresh cufes2 fig 4e demonstrating the formation of abundant s vacancies which could be favorable for the regeneration of surface bound fe ii and cu i to further shed light on the mechanism of cufes2 spc process xps was employed to investigate the change of chemical valence state of pristine and used cufes2 particles as displayed in fig 5 a the full range scan spectrum of cufes2 particles verified the presence of cu fe s c and o elements as shown in fig 5b d the cu 2p level splits into 2p3 2 and 2p1 2 peaks at 931 8 and 951 8 ev respectively implying that the cu i was the dominant cu species in cufes2 particles dai et al 2018 after the catalytic oxidation there was almost no change of cu i species except for a small newly formed peak at about 950 ev assigned to the cu2 liu et al 2020a this result further suggested that the potential contribution of cu ii cu i for spc activation was limited the fe 2p spectrum displays peaks at 724 8 and 709 2ev were corresponding to fe ii and the binding energies of 711 2 and 719 9 ev were attributed to fe iii suggesting the coexistence of fe ii fe iii on the pristine cufes2 surface zhang et al 2020b after the catalytic oxidation the percentage of fe ii decreased from 60 5 to 56 7 which indicated that the fe ii species on the cufes2 surface partially suffered from oxidation and the abundant fe ii species was crucial for activation of spc to produce ros in the case of the fresh s 2p spectrum the peaks appeared at 162 4 161 0 and 162 1 ev suggesting the 2 valence state of s which can act as the electron donor to promote the regeneration of fe ii and cu i as described by eqs 18 21 consequently the low valent sulfur was partially oxidized into s0 163 9 ev and so4 2 168 4 ev during the catalytic process which was consistent with the previous reports nie et al 2019 xu et al 2019 despite the fe iii species could be reduced by either h2o2 or o2 the reduction of fe iii by h2o2 was found to be inefficient at ph 4 shi et al 2014 therefore the role of h2o2 for mediating the redox cycles of fe iii fe ii under our established catalytic process could be ruled out in a word the strongly reductive o2 and sulfur species as well as the interaction between cu i and fe iii enabled the accelerated fe iii fe ii cycles 18 2s2 2fe iii cu ii s2 2 2fe ii cu i 19 2s2 2 2fe iii cu ii sn 2 2fe ii cu i 20 sn 2 2fe iii cu ii s0 2fe ii cu i 21 s0 6fe iii cu ii so4 2 6fe ii cu i according to the results and discussion above a possible mechanism for spc activation by cufes2 is proposed in fig 6 first of all the fe ii and cu i on cufes2 surface would firstly activate spc to generate oh through the traditional fenton like process accompanied by the generation of fe iii and cu ii then the available oh would mainly convert into other ros such as co3 o2 and 1o2 through chain reactions in the presence of carbonate ions simultaneously the cufes2 particles could activate molecular oxygen via the single electron pathway to produce o2 at neutral ph the generated o2 together with reductive sulfur species as well as the interaction between cu i and fe iii enabled the promoted fe iii fe ii cycles on cufes2 surface which guaranteed the steady supply of surface bound fe species for efficient spc activation consequently all these available ros oh co3 o2 and 1o2 contributed to the degradation of smt 3 5 practicability of cufes2 spc process the reusability of cufes2 was evaluated by the recycle tests as can be seen from fig s7a a progressive performance decay was observed and over four reuse cycles smt removal at 45 min was 57 3 it might be ascribed to the change of cufes2 surface properties fig s8a confirmed that the xrd spectrum of reused cufes2 was almost similar to the fresh one except for the newly appeared slight signal at 2θ 31 5º and 39 9º which probably arose from the newly generated copper and iron oxy hydroxides indicating that the cufes2 particles suffered from oxidation to some extent besides the active sites were possibly partially occupied by the adsorbed insoluble carbonates and sulfates thus inducing slight deactivation of the as prepared particles kong et al 2019 the sem images in fig s8b uncovered a certain agglomeration of particles with a rougher surface as compared with the pristine counterpart eds analysis evidenced the presence of c and the contents of o and s were elevated but that of cu and fe were declined after consecutive use confirming the oxidation of cufes2 particles and precipitation of insoluble carbonate and sulfates on the cufes2 surface fig s8c worth noting the removal ability of cufes2 spc process toward smt was greatly refreshed which gradually increased from 57 3 to 75 6 after ultrasound treatment in 0 1 m hcl solution for 30 min seen in fig s7a demonstrating the relative satisfactory reusability of cufes2 the metal iron leaching tests of each cycle showed that cufes2 possessed admirable stability which was benefited from the neutral ph induced by the buffering capacity of spc as described in table s2 both dissolved iron and copper leaching amounts were always lower than 0 28 mg l which were distinctly below the regulation of environmental quality standards for surface water gb 3838 2002 china and superior to those of previous reported cufes2 based aops huang et al 2020 nie et al 2019 peng et al 2020 xu et al 2019 in addition other three typical pollutants i e bpa carbamazepine cbz and sulfamethoxazole smx were further selected to investigate the universal applicability of cufes2 spc process for the degradation of all pollutants bpa 66 0 smt 86 4 and smx 100 could be effectively degraded while the oxidative degradation of cbz was less effective in the cufes2 spc process and only 56 2 of cbz could be eliminated in 45 min fig s7b the degradation differences among selected pollutants might result from the selectivity of ros toward different functional groups liu et al 2020b diverse ros i e oh 1o2 o2 and co3 generated in the cufes2 spc process were electrophilic endowing the developed catalytic process with high selectivity in the removal of specific pollutants that contained electron rich moieties gao et al 2018 the aromatic anilines nitrogen containing and sulfur containing compounds were more vulnerable to be attacked by generated ros in the developed catalytic process among them the smt smx and bpa possessed abundant electron donating groups such as alkoxy amino and hydroxyl groups compared with cbz thus displaying better removal efficiencies the above results manifested that the cufes2 spc process owns highly selectivity and would have an extensive application in treating certain pollutants water matrices play a pivotal role in water purification as the ubiquitous organic and inorganic substances in aqueous matrices can induce adverse effects on wastewater treatment chen et al 2020b hence the degradation of smt by cufes2 spc system was performed in different water matrices i e ultrapure water tap water and simulative groundwater to assess the feasibility of applying this process in actual water body and the results are presented in fig s7c although the degradation of smt was somewhat restrained in both tap water and simulative groundwater relative to ultrapure water it was still acceptable specifically the removal efficiencies of smt in tap water and simulative groundwater decreased from 86 4 to 72 4 and 69 1 respectively the inferior performance in tap water and simulative groundwater might be ascribed to the quenching effects resulted from the ubiquitous organic and inorganic substances table s3 the aforementioned merits in terms of relatively satisfactory reusability robust stability and tolerance to background water matrices as well as selectivity in degrading diverse pollutants endowed cufes2 a potential effective catalyst for the percarbonate mediated water decontamination 3 6 smt degradation intermediates and toxicity assessment to clarify the degradation pathway of smt in the cufes2 spc system the transformation products of smt were analyzed by lc ms and seven final intermediates were confirmed which included 4 6 dimethylpyrimidin 2 amine nitrobenzene p1 m z 124 4 nitrophenol 2 amino 4 6 dimethylpyrimidin 5 ol p2 m z 140 4 6 dimethylpyrimidin 5 ol p3 m z 125 e 1 nitro n vinylethan 1 imine p4 m z 115 z z 1 ethylidene 2 methylguanidine p5 m z 100 n ethyl n methyl n 4 nitrophenyl methanetriamine p6 m z 225 and 4 4 6 dimethylpyrimidin 2 yl amino phenol p7 m z 216 seen in table s4 and fig s9 based on the identified intermediates the possible smt degradation pathways were proposed as illustrated in fig 7 a the attack of ros e g o2 oh co3 and 1o2 could lead to the cleavage of s n bond to form compound p1 which was frequently reported in aops based water purification toward sulfonamides removal du et al 2018 feng et al 2016 the generated product p1 and its nitro derivative p m z 154 would undergo some de alkylation process and ring opening reactions to generate p5 and p4 respectively meanwhile the so2 extrusion resulted in the formation of aniline which could be further oxidized to nitrobenzene p1 1 the electrophilic replacement by oh that occurred on the aromatic ring p1 1 would lead to the generation of hydroxylated nitrobenzene p2 1 likewise the presence of p2 could also be ascribed to the hydroxylation of p1 subsequently the interaction between co3 and nh2 group resulted in the generation of p3 since co3 was more selective to attack nh2 group yang et al 2017 furthermore the electron donating effect of nh2 group enabled the coupling of p1 and p1 1 to produce compound p m z 245 the p further gives rise to p6 through the successive de alkylation process and ring opening reactions the obtained product p2 1 may be attacked by ros to generate phenol p m z 95 and then coupling with p1 leading to the formation of p7 ultimately the above intermediates could be partially mineralized to co2 and h2o furthermore smt degradation intermediates generated in different processes were compared twelve and nine intermediates were identified in cufes2 h2o2 and cufes2 h2o2 na2co3 processes respectively tables s5 6 and figs s10 11 obviously the cufes2 h2o2 process mainly gave rise to hydroxylated products as it was confirmed to be a oh dominated oxidation process in the case of cufes2 h2o2 the available ros would be altered with the introduction of carbonate ions in addition to oh the smt molecules could be attacked by other electrophilic ros as a result the n centered and nitro derivatives were also observed since the generated co3 exhibited higher reactivity towards nh2 group therefore the important role of carbonate ions for the conversion of oh to other ros cannot be ignored likewise the diversity of degradation intermediates in the cufes2 spc process also proved the formation of diverse ros which was beneficial to the efficient removal of target contaminants in addition both the bioaccumulation factors and developmental toxicity of smt and its degradation intermediates were predicted by the toxicity estimation software tool t e s t liu et al 2019 wang et al 2020b among these intermediates the bioaccumulation factors of p4 and p5 could not be predicted as presented in fig 7b the smt intermediates exhibited slight enhancement in bioaccumulation compared with the original smt except for p2 and p6 especially the result of p7 19 97 which was 6 77 times higher than that of smt 2 57 might be due to its higher lipophilicity moreover developmental toxicity was adopted to evaluate whether these compounds have an adverse developmental toxicity effect on humans or animals peng et al 2021 smt was categorized as a developmental toxicant and the treatment process could reduce the developmental toxicity of the smt intermediates except for p5 fig 7c even more exciting was that the intermediates p1 1 p2 1 and p4 became developmental non toxic overall the above toxicity prediction indicated that the degradation of smt was accompanied by the formation of toxic intermediates despite the toxicity of most smt intermediates could be reduced by cufes2 spc process some intermediates still exhibited toxicity therefore the degradation duration needs to be prolonged to guarantee a higher extent of mineralization 4 conclusion in the present study the novel cufes2 spc process exerted excellent catalytic reactivity towards smt degradation in neutral reaction media under conditions of 0 5 g l cufes2 and 0 8 mm spc at ph 7 1 86 4 0 054 min 1 of smt could be degraded within 45 min the cufes2 spc process was confirmed as a multi ros process which enabled the generation of oh co3 o2 and 1o2 based on the quenching experiments and esr tests the generated oh through the traditional heterogeneous fenton like pathway would result in the generation of other ros in the presence of carbonate ions and contribute to the degradation of smt it was also found that the abundant surface bound fe ii dominated spc activation process simultaneously it was validated that the reductive sulfur species the interaction between cu i and fe iii as well as the available o2 produced by molecular oxygen activation and the conversion of oh favored the redox cycle of fe species on cufes2 surface moreover the cufes2 spc process exhibited acceptable removal efficiency of smt in the presence of inorganic anions and nom with relatively satisfactory reusability after regeneration treatment additionally the application of spc endowed the degradation process with robust stability and avoid the undesired acidification of effluents the toxicity evaluation demonstrated that the developmental toxicity and bioaccumulation factors of smt were reduced in a word the combination of transition metal

16806,in this work the novel application of chalcopyrite cufes2 for sodium percarbonate spc activation towards sulfamethazine smt degradation was explored several key influencing factors like spc concentration cufes2 dosage reaction temperature ph value anions and humic acid ha were investigated experimental results indicated that smt could be effectively degraded in the neutral reaction media by cufes2 spc process 86 4 0 054 min 1 at ph 7 1 the mechanism of spc activation by cufes2 was elucidated which was discovered to be a multiple reactive oxygen species multi ros process with the coexistence of hydroxyl radical oh carbonate radical co3 superoxide radical o2 and singlet oxygen 1o2 as evidenced by quenching experiments and electron spin resonance esr tests the generated oh via the traditional heterogeneous fenton like process would not only react with carbonate ions to yield other ros but also involve in smt degradation the abundant surface bound fe ii was deemed to be the dominant catalytic active sites for spc activation meanwhile it was verified that the reductive sulfur species the interaction between cu i and fe iii as well as the available o2 derived from the activation of molecular oxygen and the conversion of oh favored the regeneration of fe ii on cufes2 surface furthermore the degradation intermediates of smt and their toxicities were evaluated this study presents a novel strategy by integrating transition metal sulfides with percarbonate for antibiotic contaminated water treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords advanced oxidation chalcopyrite reactive oxygen species sodium percarbonate sulfamethazine 1 introduction up to date pharmaceuticals residue especially antibiotics have attracted tremendous attention owing to their ubiquitous occurrence and adverse effects on the aquatic environment tian et al 2020 li et al 2020 these antibiotics have been frequently detected in different environmental mediums such as soil wastewater treatment plant effluents rivers and groundwater as well as drinking water wang et al 2020a zhang et al 2020a among antibiotics sulfamethazine smt a typical case of sulfonamide bacteriostatic antibiotic has been extensively employed in human and veterinary medicine li et al 2017 vione et al 2018 the concentration of smt in surface water ranged from ng l to μg l level which may result in a high incidence of antibiotic resistance even at trace concentration thereby posing a great threat to the ecosystem and public health xie et al 2020 yin et al 2018 unfortunately conventional wastewater treatment plants wwtps exhibited poor performance in antibiotics elimination from contaminated water environments it was found that only 30 and 45 of norfloxacin could be eliminated by the activated sludge process in shatin and stanley wwtps li and zhang 2011 in the nitrate anaerobic denitrifying system almost 100 removal of 10 mg l sulfadiazine was achieved only after a long period of treatment 168 h zheng et al 2020 hence it is highly desirable to exploit an efficient method to achieve effective smt removal advanced oxidation processes aops have been recognized as one of the most promising alternative remediation techniques in eliminating these antibiotics due to the efficient generation of reactive oxygen species ros such as sulfate radical so4 hydroxyl radical oh superoxide radical o2 and singlet oxygen 1o2 in these aops peroxides like hydrogen peroxide h2o2 peroxymonosulfate pms and peroxydisulfate pds have been extensively employed as sources of reactive radicals which can be activated by various means e g thermolysis uv transition metals ao and liu 2017 chan and chu 2009 du et al 2018 yang et al 2010 similar to the aforementioned peroxides sodium percarbonate spc na2co3 1 5h2o2 a solid carrier of h2o2 as shown in eq 1 is deemed to be a non toxic and environmentally friendly oxidant with superior stability longer storage time and anti explosion property compared with liquid h2o2 gao et al 2020 moreover its alkaline property rendered the spc based aops with a wider ph range suitability and avoid the undesired acidification of water environments thereby attracting increasing attention fu et al 2016 wang et al 2019 1 na2co3 1 5h2o2 na2co3 1 5 h2o2 several strategies have been developed to activate spc for ros generation including uv zuo et al 2020 transition metals fu et al 2015 discharge plasma wang et al 2018 and biochar hung et al 2020 among them activation by transition metals for environmental remediation have drawn considerable attention for example fe2 catalyzed spc process was applied for the treatment of benzene and sulfamethoxazole fu et al 2015 yan et al 2018 li et al 2019 demonstrated v iv activated spc process displayed huge potential in removing aniline due to the generation of powerful oh o2 and co3 likewise lin and co workers illustrated that ferrocene can catalyze spc to efficiently degrade amaranth dye in water and completely amaranth degradation could be achieved within 80 min lin et al 2017 these successful applications of transition metals in spc activation implied the possibility of using transition metal sulfides tmss based catalysts in spc activation due to their excellent electrical conductivity rich redox sites superior optical characteristics and robust catalytical performance li et al 2021 despite tmss have been widely investigated as heterogeneous catalysts during some chemical oxidation processes e g pms pds h2o2 and o3 based aops they are barely explored for the activation of spc towards antibiotics degradation chalcopyrite cufes2 is one of the most extensively distributed sulfur minerals in the earth s crust comprising earth abundant low cost and non toxic constituents accounting for about 80 of the worldwide copper resource olvera et al 2018 it has been demonstrated to be a versatile heterogeneous catalyst for peroxymonocarbonate h2o2 and pms activation as well as electro chemical advanced oxidation process to degrade organic pollutants barhoumi et al 2017 huang et al 2020 peng et al 2020 xu et al 2019 for instance nie et al 2019 reported that 99 7 of bisphenol a bpa could be degraded with a high mineralization 75 within 20 min by cufes2 pms process due to the enhanced cycling of fe3 fe2 and cu2 cu induced by the reductive sulfur species the n type cufes2 was employed as the catalyst to activate h2o2 towards azo dye orange ii ao7 removal achieving 100 removal efficiency at natural ph within 5 min huang et al 2020 nevertheless in this case the heterogeneous process only contributed to approximately 20 of ao7 removal and the concentration of leached fe2 was up to 6 mg l likewise the concentration of leached cu and fe ions in cufes2 pms process were 3 8 mg l and 1 8 mg l respectively after 20 min of treatment due to the acid characteristic of the reaction solution caused by the added oxidant pms nie et al 2019 although the aforementioned spc based oxidation processes could avoid the undesired acidic conditions and reduce the leaching of metal ions from catalysts these oxidation processes were usually with a high dosage of spc but a relatively low removal efficiency and the mechanism of ros formation was ambiguous to the best of our knowledge no work is available to investigate the feasibility and mechanisms of cufes2 in spc activation for water purification which is expected to be an effective and environmental friendly process for the degradation of antibiotics therefore in the present work the catalytic performance and reaction kinetics of cufes2 for spc activation under different conditions were systematically explored by choosing smt as a model contaminant the available reactive oxygen species for smt degradation and the underlying mechanisms of the cufes2 spc process were disclosed meanwhile the practicability of the cufes2 spc process was evaluated ultimately the degradation pathways and variation of toxicity of smt were analyzed 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents all the chemicals were used as received without further purification solutions were prepared by ultrapure water 18 25 mω cm generated from a water purifier uph ii 10t china the details for chemicals are described in supplementary information si text s1 2 2 experiment procedures all the degradation experiments were conducted in a 200 ml glass beaker containing 100 ml smt solution under constant mechanical stirring 300 rpm and the temperature was controlled at 25 with a water bath reaction was initiated by simultaneously adding predetermined amounts of spc and cufes2 into smt aqueous solution 1 ml of samples were periodically collected filtered with 0 22 μm syringe filtered immediately and then quenched with na2s2o3 solution 50 μl 0 1 m before the analysis by high performance liquid chromatography hplc the initial ph of smt solution was measured to be 5 8 without any adjustment it was worth noting that once spc was introduced into the catalytic process the ph value of the reaction media would rise rapidly to neutral or alkaline conditions and remained relatively stable due to its alkaline and buffering properties regardless of the initial ph value of the solution seen in fig s1 therefore the adjustment of the initial solution ph was fulfilled before adding specific dosage of spc and cufes2 using 0 1 m hcl or naoh if necessary which was able to avoid the undesired acidification of effluent and effectively inhibit excessive metal ions leaching to evaluate the reusability of cufes2 the spent cufes2 was collected by filtration then the obtained cufes2 was rinsed with ethanol and ultrapure water for three times and dried at 60 c under vacuum before next use to distinguish the involved reactive species quenching experiments were performed with the addition of tert butyl alcohol tba furfuryl alcohol ffa phenol phoh benzoquinone bq and superoxide dismutase sod as scavengers all experiments were carried out in duplicates or triplicates and the mean values with standard deviations were presented 2 3 catalysts synthesis and characterization the details of the synthesis and characterization of catalysts used in this study are provided in si text s2 text s3 fig s2 gives the detailed characterization analysis of as obtained cufes2 particles 2 4 analytical method the

in table s1 the total organic carbon toc of the reacted solution was examined with a toc analyzer toc vcph shimadzu japan the ph of test solutions was measured by a ph meter phs 3c an ion chromatograph system dionex aquion usa was applied to determine the concentration of chloride ion cl calcium ion ca2 sulfate ion so4 2 and sodium ions na the concentration of total dissolved iron and copper was measured by a modified spectrophotometric method using 1 10 phenanthroline and neocuproine ncp at 510 nm and 455 nm respectively ren et al 2020 the optical absorption of the obtained nitro blue tetrazorium nbt solution was recorded by uv vis spectroscopy shimadzu 2250 at 259 nm to confirm the concentration variation of o2 the concentration of oh was quantified by benzoic acid ba using hplc wang et al 2014 both the bioaccumulation factors and developmental toxicity of smt and its degradation intermediates were assessed by quantitative structure activity relationship qsar using toxicity estimation software tool t e s t version 5 1 based on the consensus method electron spin resonance esr signals were measured by bruker jes fa200 spectrometer using 5 5 dimethy 1 pyrroline dmpo and 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 4 piperidinol temp as trapping agents the degradation intermediates of smt were determined by the high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms agilent 1290 6470 triple quad ms usa and the detailed description was shown in si text s4 in all the experiments the degradation of smt followed pseudo first order kinetic which can be described as 2 ln sm t

r is the gas constant 8 314 j mol k and t is the absolute temperature k 3 results and discussion 3 1 smt degradation in different processes the degradation of smt was performed under different processes as is evident from fig 1 a only 6 0 removal of smt was observed after 45 min of reaction in spc alone process which may be ascribed to the lack of oxidizing species similarly the cufes2 alone process exhibited passive performance with 28 7 removal of smt in 45 min indicating that self adsorption slightly contributed to the removal of smt remarkably the coexistence of spc and cufes2 achieved a relatively high degradation of smt 86 4 of smt could be degraded in 45 min with k obs value at 0 054 min 1 which was much higher than those in the cufes2 0 007 min 1 and spc 0 003 min 1 alone processes suggesting the activation of spc by the cufes2 fig 1b accordingly the mineralization efficiency of the three processes displayed a similar trend to smt degradation fig s3a where 28 9 mineralization was achieved in the cufes2 spc process which was higher than those in spc alone 2 4 and cufes2 alone 1 0 processes confirming that cufes2 possess the catalytic ability for spc to efficiently generate reactive species thereby promoting the mineralization of smt furthermore the catalytic activities of other catalysts cufeo2 cus and fes2 for spc activation were compared it was found that the catalytic performance of cufes2 particles outperformed the other three catalysts when cufeo2 cus and fes2 were employed for spc activation only about 70 4 28 8 and 29 9 smt removal efficiencies could be achieved respectively the k obs value obtained in cufes2 spc process was about 1 93 6 75 and 27 times those in the cufeo2 spc cus spc and fes2 spc processes respectively fig 1b which hinted that there might be a synergistic effect between cu and fe in the cufes2 spc process and the substitution of oxygen with more electronegative sulfur may be beneficial for the cycling of redox pairs xu et al 2018 therefore the degradation performance of cufeo2 spc process was still lower than that of cufes2 spc process additionally the other three cufes2 peroxide processes toward smt degradation under identical experimental conditions were compared as depicted in fig 1 the removal efficiencies of smt were determined to be 59 6 0 017 min 1 80 2 0 047 min 1 and 62 0 0 027 min 1 for cufes2 ps cufes2 pms and cufes2 h2o2 processes respectively these results demonstrated the decontamination superiority of cufes2 spc process under neutral conditions which rendered huge potential in practical application while the other three cufes2 peroxide processes that inclined to efficiently degrade pollutants under acidic conditions huang et al 2020 nie et al 2019 peng et al 2020 therefore cufes2 spc process is expected to be environmental friendly as it can effectively avoid excessive leaching of metal ions from cufes2 particles under acidic conditions due to the buffering effect caused by carbonate ions along with that the major end products of spc are usually non toxic like co2 h2o and na2co3 3 2 effect of some key parameters the decontamination superiority of cufes2 spc process could be ascribed to multiple influencing factors experiments were further performed to examine the impacts of several key influencing factors i e spc concentration cufes2 dosage reaction temperature ph value anions and humic acid ha on smt degradation 3 2 1 effect of spc concentration cufes2 dosage and reaction temperature as displayed in fig 2 a and f the smt removal efficiency was elevated from 73 4 to 89 6 after 45 min as the initial spc concentration increased from 0 5 to 1 mm and the corresponding k obs value of smt degradation gradually increased from 0 027 to 0 061 min 1 the enhanced degradation of smt at a higher spc concentration was likely attributed to the generation of more reactive oxygen species nevertheless the further increase of spc concentration to 2mm at the given time resulted in a decrease in the smt degradation 26 5 0 006 min 1 since the excessive spc induced a higher level of h2o2 and solution alkalinity which enabled to scavenge oh as described by eqs 4 5 farooq et al 2021 4 h2o2 oh h2o ooh 5 ooh oh h2o o2 the effect of cufes2 dosage 0 1 0 8 g l on smt degradation in the cufes2 spc process was also investigated and illustrated in fig 2b it was clear that the degradation of smt gradually boosted from 52 2 to nearly 86 4 after reaction for 45 min as the cufes2 dosage raised from 0 1 to 0 5 g l likewise as described in fig 2f the k obs value increased from 0 017 min 1 to 0 054 min 1 since more suspended cufes2 particles would supply more catalytic active sites for the activation of spc to generate considerable amounts of ros thereby promoting the removal of smt however further increasing cufes2 dosage from 0 5 to 0 8 g l only resulted in a slight enhancement in smt removal increased by 5 kobs 0 070 min 1 since the excess dosage of cufes2 would cause a deadweight loss of ros and may increase the risk of metal ions leaching thus the dosage of 0 5 g l was chosen as an ideal dosage for the rest of the experiments the effect of reaction temperature on the degradation of smt was investigated as illustrated in fig 2c the results showed that when the reaction temperature elevated from 288 to 318 k the degradation of smx would gradually increase from 77 3 to 91 5 accordingly the k obs value enhanced from 0 038 min 1 to 0 076 min 1 following eq 3 the activation energy e a was calculated to be 18 12 kj mol 1 inset figure of fig 2c which was smaller than the previous reported metal sulfides based aops e g 32 4 kj mol 1 of cufes2 pms system nie et al 2019 40 67 kj mol 1 of cuco2s4 pms system xu et al 2018 and 19 42 kj mol 1 of fes ps system chen et al 2017 the results revealed that the process was endothermic since the catalytic activity of cufes2 enhanced with temperature increase the higher temperature may promote the decomposition of spc and the corrosion of cufes2 thus resulting in an enhancement of ros production rate which favored the degradation of smt the results hinted that the obtained cufes2 enabled to be employed as an efficient catalyst under mild ambient temperature 3 2 2 effect of solution ph it is generally acknowledged that the performance of heterogeneous aops is closely related to the solution ph therefore the effect of solution initial ph phini on the degradation of smt using two different adjustment methods was explored and the results are given in fig 2d e firstly the control of phini was accomplished before adding spc and cufes2 in the smt solution the order of smt degradation after reaction for 45 min was phini 3 1 86 4 phini 4 0 73 3 phini 5 81 31 1 phini 7 1 27 8 phini 9 0 26 2 in parallel the highest k obs of smt removal were also obtained at phini 3 1 0 054 min 1 which was significantly higher than those of phini 4 0 9 0 0 006 0 027 min 1 fig 2f previous studies have pointed out that spc would contribute to the alkalinity of reaction media and result in a buffering effect danish et al 2017 therefore the ph change of the reaction processes was further monitored once the spc was introduced into the reaction solution the solution phs quickly rose from 3 1 9 0 to 7 1 9 50 and then maintained almost constant figs s1 and 2d namely the cufes2 spc process actually worked under neutral or alkaline conditions indicating that neutral ph was more suitable for smt degradation which was distinctly different from the traditional fenton process we further investigated the catalytic performance of the process by pre adding specific amount of spc before adjusting the solution ph results manifested that the satisfactory performance of the cufes2 spc process for smt removal could be achieved in a wide ph range except for phini 10 54 fig 2e the catalytic reaction occurred at a low phini 3 15 would induce the excessive leaching of metal ions 5 89 mg l for dissolved iron and 8 29 mg l for dissolved copper fig s3b resulting in the concern of secondary pollution even the smt was almost completely degraded within 15 min while the metal ions leaching problem can be well controlled by pre adjusting the soultion ph before adding spc and the corresponding concentrations of dissolved iron and copper at phini 3 1 were measured to be 0 198 mg l and 0 211 mg l respectively fig s3c these combined results indicated that the cufes2 spc process was suitable for water purification over a broad ph range to further elucidate the effect of initial ph on the treatment of smt by cufes2 spc process zeta potential of cufes2 was determined as shown in fig s3d cufes2 was negatively charged under all investigated ph values as ph increased to 9 0 and 10 55 most of smt were present as anionic species pka1 2 28 and pka2 7 42 fig s3e and the electrostatic repulsion between cufes2 and smt was expected to weaken the interaction of target contaminants with catalytic active sites thus hampering the degradation of smt chen et al 2020a teixido et al 2011 the higher ph levels might not only lower the oxidation potential of oh but also lead to the self decomposition of h2o2 to h2o and o2 due to its unstable property which was not conducive to the subsequent conversion of oh to other ros tang and wang 2019 besides the strong alkaline conditions accelerated the precipitation of metal ions and weakened the synergistic effect between fe ii and cu ι thus reducing the availability of catalytic sites on the surface of cufes2 which followed the similar trend obtained in the previous reported spc induced catalytic processes farooq et al 2021 sajjadi et al 2018 to balance the costs of post treatment of acidized effluent catalytic performance and metal leaching problem the regulation of ph was fulfilled before adding spc and the reaction media at ph 7 1 was chosen in subsequent experiments 3 3 effect of inorganic ions and nom the ubiquitous inorganic ions and natural organic matter nom that existed in the actual water might present negative or positive effects on the elimination of target pollutants thereby the effects of different kinds of common anions i e hco3 cl so4 2 and h2po4 and ha on smt degradation were studied with detailed discussion in si text s5 fig s4 in short the decontamination capability of the cufes2 spc process was suppressed with the addition of inorganic ions and organic matter to some extent especially in the presence of 2 mm hco3 3 4 mechanistic insights for cufes2 spc process 3 4 1 identification of reactive species in spc activation processes possible ros including oh 1o2 o2 and co3 may be generated danish et al 2017 li et al 2019 therefore quenching experiments were performed to probe whether these active species were generated in the cufes2 spc process firstly tba was employed to assess the contribution of oh k 3 8 7 6 108 m 1s 1 as shown in fig 3 a b when 100 mm tba was added the removal efficiency of smt reduced from 86 4 to 56 9 and the corresponding k obs value decreased from 0 054 to 0 024 min 1 manifesting that the oh did occur in the reaction process via the traditional fenton like reaction eqs 6 7 it has been recognized that spc can be decomposed into h2o2 and carbonate ions and then subsequently may convert oh to other ros gao et al 2020 xu et al 2019 hence scavengers for co3 o2 and 1o2 were selected to further evaluate the possibly available ros as observed the degradation of smt was remarkably decreased by 46 8 upon addition of 50 mm phoh kobs 0 014 min 1 the scavenger of both oh and co3 k phoh oh 6 0 108 m 1s 1 k phoh co3 2 2 107 m 1s 1 and the discrepancy of smt degradation efficiency between tba and phoh confirmed that the co3 was indeed generated in the cufes2 spc process in the presence of 20 mm ffa the scavenger for 1o2 k2 1 2 108 m 1s 1 the removal efficiency and k obs value of smt slightly decreased to 67 2 and 0 035 min 1 while the dosing of 5 mm bq k 0 9 1 109 m 1 s 1 almost completely suppressed the degradation of the smt with a much lower k obs value 27 2 0 006 min 1 which was nearly the same as that of pure adsorption 28 7 0 007 min 1 meanwhile sod another effective scavenger for o2 was further employed to explore the formation of o2 k2 1 2 108 m 1s 1 similar to bq the addition of 0 03 g l sod sharply reduced the removal efficiency of smt which was 6 7 times lower than that of the control experiment no scavenger is present illustrating the indispensable role of o2 in smt degradation these combined results hinted that oh 1o2 o2 co3 were possibly involved in the degradation process 6 cu i h2o2 cu ii oh oh 7 fe ii h2o2 fe iii oh oh to provide direct evidence for the generation of ros esr spectra were recorded using dmpo 100 mm or temp 40 mm as trapping agents as observed from fig 3c the characteristic peak signals of dmpo oh dmpo co3 dmpo o2 and temp 1o2 were detected confirming that cufes2 spc process was a multi ros process with the coexistence of oh co3 o2 and 1o2 which was consistent with the quenching experiments it should be noticed that the intensity of oh and co3 captured by dmpo was weaker than the other two peak signals due to the interaction between oh and hco3 co3 2 which may result in the consumption of oh as described by eqs 8 14 the concentration of oh during the degradation process was monitored as demonstrated in fig 3d the generated oh firstly increased to 292 4 μm within 15 min and then gradually decreased to 53 9 μm when the degradation process was terminated the phenomenon was different from the typical oh dominated process in which the oh concentration would progressively accumulate demonstrating the involvement of other ros for smt degradation ren et al 2020 hence a similar catalytic experiment was conducted in which the smt was replaced by atrazine atz with the same initial concentration atz has high reactivity with oh k atz oh 2 5 109 m 1s 1 but is less sensitive to co3 k atz co3 4 106 m 1s 1 zhang et al 2015 hence if oh would mainly react with carbonate ions to form other ros in cufes2 spc process the degradation of atz could be largely hampered it was found that the degradation efficiency of atz in cufes2 spc process decreased by 43 4 compared with that of smt fig 3d thus the observed peak signals of dmpo oh and dmpo co3 were relatively weak 8 oh co3 2 oh co3 k 3 9 108 m 1s 1 9 oh hco3 h2o co3 k 8 5 106 m 1s 1 10 h2o2 co3 hco3 ho2 11 ho2 h o2 12 o2 oh 1o2 oh 13 ho2 o2 1o2 ho2 14 2o2 2h2o 1o2 h2o2 2oh 3 4 2 role of carbonate ions to further validate the above speculation the role of the carbonate ions in ros evolution in the cufes2 spc process was further validated h2o2 and na2co3 in equal amount to the constituents of spc were utilized to catalyze cufes2 for comparison 92 9 smt removal efficiency was achieved after 45 min of treatment by cufes2 h2o2 process which was verified to be a typical oh dominated process under acidic conditions due to the strong inhibitory effect caused by the addition of tba and the stronger characteristic peak signal of dmpo oh relative to dmpo o2 fig s5a b in the cufes2 h2o2 na2co3 process 84 8 of smt could be degraded which was slightly lower than that of cufes2 spc process fig 4 a the available ros may be altered in the cufes2 h2o2 process due to the addition of carbonate ions as shown in fig s5c about 59 9 68 0 and 38 7 of smt were removed in the presence of tba sod and phoh respectively this result demonstrated the coexistence of oh co3 and o2 which was also confirmed by the esr tests fig s5d likewise the level of oh was found to be negatively correlated with carbonate ions concentration the final concentration of oh declined from 212 3 to 82 76 57 44 and 29 85 μm as the carbonate ions concentration increased from 0 to 0 8 1 0 and 2 0 mm respectively fig s5e meanwhile the excess carbonate ions can act as the scavenger for both oh and o2 zhu et al 2018 the replacement of h2o2 by spc benefitted for the control of effluent ph due to the buffering effect which endowed a wider ph suitability and prevented excess metal ions leaching the ph values during the reaction process always maintained around 7 3 which was in accordance with the status of the cufes2 spc process fig s5f moreover the presence of carbonate ions enabled the generation of diverse electrophilic reactive oxygen species showing splendid reactivity in eliminating electron rich compounds therefore it can be concluded that the generated oh played a dual role in the cufes2 spc process it would mainly react with carbonate ions to form other ros through a series of chain reactions and partially contributed to the degradation of smt due to its limited oxidation potential at higher ph value 3 4 3 role of superoxide radical surface fe and s species in order to confirm the essential role of o2 nbt was selected as a qualitative indicator of o2 as it could undergo stepwise reduction with o2 k 5 88 104 m 1s 1 to form monoformazan cheng et al 2017 as illustrated in fig s6 the maximum absorbance λ 259 nm of nbt dramatically decreased as the reaction proceeded since the nbt can react with both oh and o2 zhao et al 2014 a new maximum absorption was observed at 560 nm suggesting the formation of o2 in the cufes2 spc process since the evolution of o2 was ph dependent and the neutral ph favored the generation of o2 fang et al 2013 besides molecular oxygen was also validated to be an indispensable driving force during alachlor degradation in the fes2 h2o2 process liu et al 2015 to uncover the role of dissolved oxygen in the formation of o2 experiment was performed in deoxygenated solution continuously purged with n2 as described in fig 4b the smt degradation efficiency was decreased by 35 under anoxic condition compared with the control experiment without purging manifesting that molecular oxygen could be reduced to o2 directly by the surface fe ii and cu i of cufes2 via single electron transfer route the standard redox potential for cu ii cu i fe iii fe ii and o2 o2 is 0 17 0 77 and 0 33 v vs rhe zhao et al 2020 respectively which was thermodynamically favorable for the regeneration of cu i and fe ii as expressed by eqs 15 17 it was reported that the spc decay rate induced by cu ii was significantly lower than those of fe ii and fe iii ma et al 2020 thus the cu i cu ii mediated spc activation process was less responsible for smt degradation conversely the surface bound fe species should be the dominating catalytic active sites for spc activation as evidenced by the uv vis spectra recorded in the presence of 1 10 phenanthroline fig 4c a significant characteristic peak of fe ii without filtration at 510 nm appeared during the catalytic process while the absorbance of phenanthroline fe ii peak collected by filtering the reaction suspension before adding 1 10 phenanthroline was almost completely disappeared the results offered direct evidence for the formation of surface bound fe ii which was favorable for the efficient and continuous spc activation 15 fe iii o2 fe ii o2 16 cu ii o2 cu i o2 17 fe iii cu i fe ii cu ii to further verify the above conclusion quenching experiments were performed using 2 2 bipyridine bpy and ncp which would complex with fe ii and cu i on the surface of cufes2 hindering electron transfer to the oxidants fang et al 2020 ren et al 2020 as demonstrated in fig 4d the degradation efficiency of smt dropped from 86 4 to 27 5 and 37 0 in the presence of 2 0 mm bpy and 1 0 mm ncp respectively these results confirmed that surface electron transfer from fe ii and cu i to spc induced reactive species generation in the cufes2 spc process the surface bond cu i was crucial for the regeneration of fe ii on the surface of cufes2 and the existence of surface bound fe ii played an indispensable role in ros generation due to the observed more significant inhibiting effect furthermore the sulfur vacancies were easily formed with the capture of protons by the surface s atoms coordinated to metal atoms which resulted in the exposure of more metal active sites thus boosting the catalytic performance dong et al 2018 ji et al 2021 liu et al 2018 xing et al 2018 esr test was employed to prove the formation of s vacancies during the activation of spc by cufes2 it was evident that cufes2 after the degradation process exhibited an intensified epr signal of sulfur vacancy with a g factor of 2 003 compared with the fresh cufes2 fig 4e demonstrating the formation of abundant s vacancies which could be favorable for the regeneration of surface bound fe ii and cu i to further shed light on the mechanism of cufes2 spc process xps was employed to investigate the change of chemical valence state of pristine and used cufes2 particles as displayed in fig 5 a the full range scan spectrum of cufes2 particles verified the presence of cu fe s c and o elements as shown in fig 5b d the cu 2p level splits into 2p3 2 and 2p1 2 peaks at 931 8 and 951 8 ev respectively implying that the cu i was the dominant cu species in cufes2 particles dai et al 2018 after the catalytic oxidation there was almost no change of cu i species except for a small newly formed peak at about 950 ev assigned to the cu2 liu et al 2020a this result further suggested that the potential contribution of cu ii cu i for spc activation was limited the fe 2p spectrum displays peaks at 724 8 and 709 2ev were corresponding to fe ii and the binding energies of 711 2 and 719 9 ev were attributed to fe iii suggesting the coexistence of fe ii fe iii on the pristine cufes2 surface zhang et al 2020b after the catalytic oxidation the percentage of fe ii decreased from 60 5 to 56 7 which indicated that the fe ii species on the cufes2 surface partially suffered from oxidation and the abundant fe ii species was crucial for activation of spc to produce ros in the case of the fresh s 2p spectrum the peaks appeared at 162 4 161 0 and 162 1 ev suggesting the 2 valence state of s which can act as the electron donor to promote the regeneration of fe ii and cu i as described by eqs 18 21 consequently the low valent sulfur was partially oxidized into s0 163 9 ev and so4 2 168 4 ev during the catalytic process which was consistent with the previous reports nie et al 2019 xu et al 2019 despite the fe iii species could be reduced by either h2o2 or o2 the reduction of fe iii by h2o2 was found to be inefficient at ph 4 shi et al 2014 therefore the role of h2o2 for mediating the redox cycles of fe iii fe ii under our established catalytic process could be ruled out in a word the strongly reductive o2 and sulfur species as well as the interaction between cu i and fe iii enabled the accelerated fe iii fe ii cycles 18 2s2 2fe iii cu ii s2 2 2fe ii cu i 19 2s2 2 2fe iii cu ii sn 2 2fe ii cu i 20 sn 2 2fe iii cu ii s0 2fe ii cu i 21 s0 6fe iii cu ii so4 2 6fe ii cu i according to the results and discussion above a possible mechanism for spc activation by cufes2 is proposed in fig 6 first of all the fe ii and cu i on cufes2 surface would firstly activate spc to generate oh through the traditional fenton like process accompanied by the generation of fe iii and cu ii then the available oh would mainly convert into other ros such as co3 o2 and 1o2 through chain reactions in the presence of carbonate ions simultaneously the cufes2 particles could activate molecular oxygen via the single electron pathway to produce o2 at neutral ph the generated o2 together with reductive sulfur species as well as the interaction between cu i and fe iii enabled the promoted fe iii fe ii cycles on cufes2 surface which guaranteed the steady supply of surface bound fe species for efficient spc activation consequently all these available ros oh co3 o2 and 1o2 contributed to the degradation of smt 3 5 practicability of cufes2 spc process the reusability of cufes2 was evaluated by the recycle tests as can be seen from fig s7a a progressive performance decay was observed and over four reuse cycles smt removal at 45 min was 57 3 it might be ascribed to the change of cufes2 surface properties fig s8a confirmed that the xrd spectrum of reused cufes2 was almost similar to the fresh one except for the newly appeared slight signal at 2θ 31 5º and 39 9º which probably arose from the newly generated copper and iron oxy hydroxides indicating that the cufes2 particles suffered from oxidation to some extent besides the active sites were possibly partially occupied by the adsorbed insoluble carbonates and sulfates thus inducing slight deactivation of the as prepared particles kong et al 2019 the sem images in fig s8b uncovered a certain agglomeration of particles with a rougher surface as compared with the pristine counterpart eds analysis evidenced the presence of c and the contents of o and s were elevated but that of cu and fe were declined after consecutive use confirming the oxidation of cufes2 particles and precipitation of insoluble carbonate and sulfates on the cufes2 surface fig s8c worth noting the removal ability of cufes2 spc process toward smt was greatly refreshed which gradually increased from 57 3 to 75 6 after ultrasound treatment in 0 1 m hcl solution for 30 min seen in fig s7a demonstrating the relative satisfactory reusability of cufes2 the metal iron leaching tests of each cycle showed that cufes2 possessed admirable stability which was benefited from the neutral ph induced by the buffering capacity of spc as described in table s2 both dissolved iron and copper leaching amounts were always lower than 0 28 mg l which were distinctly below the regulation of environmental quality standards for surface water gb 3838 2002 china and superior to those of previous reported cufes2 based aops huang et al 2020 nie et al 2019 peng et al 2020 xu et al 2019 in addition other three typical pollutants i e bpa carbamazepine cbz and sulfamethoxazole smx were further selected to investigate the universal applicability of cufes2 spc process for the degradation of all pollutants bpa 66 0 smt 86 4 and smx 100 could be effectively degraded while the oxidative degradation of cbz was less effective in the cufes2 spc process and only 56 2 of cbz could be eliminated in 45 min fig s7b the degradation differences among selected pollutants might result from the selectivity of ros toward different functional groups liu et al 2020b diverse ros i e oh 1o2 o2 and co3 generated in the cufes2 spc process were electrophilic endowing the developed catalytic process with high selectivity in the removal of specific pollutants that contained electron rich moieties gao et al 2018 the aromatic anilines nitrogen containing and sulfur containing compounds were more vulnerable to be attacked by generated ros in the developed catalytic process among them the smt smx and bpa possessed abundant electron donating groups such as alkoxy amino and hydroxyl groups compared with cbz thus displaying better removal efficiencies the above results manifested that the cufes2 spc process owns highly selectivity and would have an extensive application in treating certain pollutants water matrices play a pivotal role in water purification as the ubiquitous organic and inorganic substances in aqueous matrices can induce adverse effects on wastewater treatment chen et al 2020b hence the degradation of smt by cufes2 spc system was performed in different water matrices i e ultrapure water tap water and simulative groundwater to assess the feasibility of applying this process in actual water body and the results are presented in fig s7c although the degradation of smt was somewhat restrained in both tap water and simulative groundwater relative to ultrapure water it was still acceptable specifically the removal efficiencies of smt in tap water and simulative groundwater decreased from 86 4 to 72 4 and 69 1 respectively the inferior performance in tap water and simulative groundwater might be ascribed to the quenching effects resulted from the ubiquitous organic and inorganic substances table s3 the aforementioned merits in terms of relatively satisfactory reusability robust stability and tolerance to background water matrices as well as selectivity in degrading diverse pollutants endowed cufes2 a potential effective catalyst for the percarbonate mediated water decontamination 3 6 smt degradation intermediates and toxicity assessment to clarify the degradation pathway of smt in the cufes2 spc system the transformation products of smt were analyzed by lc ms and seven final intermediates were confirmed which included 4 6 dimethylpyrimidin 2 amine nitrobenzene p1 m z 124 4 nitrophenol 2 amino 4 6 dimethylpyrimidin 5 ol p2 m z 140 4 6 dimethylpyrimidin 5 ol p3 m z 125 e 1 nitro n vinylethan 1 imine p4 m z 115 z z 1 ethylidene 2 methylguanidine p5 m z 100 n ethyl n methyl n 4 nitrophenyl methanetriamine p6 m z 225 and 4 4 6 dimethylpyrimidin 2 yl amino phenol p7 m z 216 seen in table s4 and fig s9 based on the identified intermediates the possible smt degradation pathways were proposed as illustrated in fig 7 a the attack of ros e g o2 oh co3 and 1o2 could lead to the cleavage of s n bond to form compound p1 which was frequently reported in aops based water purification toward sulfonamides removal du et al 2018 feng et al 2016 the generated product p1 and its nitro derivative p m z 154 would undergo some de alkylation process and ring opening reactions to generate p5 and p4 respectively meanwhile the so2 extrusion resulted in the formation of aniline which could be further oxidized to nitrobenzene p1 1 the electrophilic replacement by oh that occurred on the aromatic ring p1 1 would lead to the generation of hydroxylated nitrobenzene p2 1 likewise the presence of p2 could also be ascribed to the hydroxylation of p1 subsequently the interaction between co3 and nh2 group resulted in the generation of p3 since co3 was more selective to attack nh2 group yang et al 2017 furthermore the electron donating effect of nh2 group enabled the coupling of p1 and p1 1 to produce compound p m z 245 the p further gives rise to p6 through the successive de alkylation process and ring opening reactions the obtained product p2 1 may be attacked by ros to generate phenol p m z 95 and then coupling with p1 leading to the formation of p7 ultimately the above intermediates could be partially mineralized to co2 and h2o furthermore smt degradation intermediates generated in different processes were compared twelve and nine intermediates were identified in cufes2 h2o2 and cufes2 h2o2 na2co3 processes respectively tables s5 6 and figs s10 11 obviously the cufes2 h2o2 process mainly gave rise to hydroxylated products as it was confirmed to be a oh dominated oxidation process in the case of cufes2 h2o2 the available ros would be altered with the introduction of carbonate ions in addition to oh the smt molecules could be attacked by other electrophilic ros as a result the n centered and nitro derivatives were also observed since the generated co3 exhibited higher reactivity towards nh2 group therefore the important role of carbonate ions for the conversion of oh to other ros cannot be ignored likewise the diversity of degradation intermediates in the cufes2 spc process also proved the formation of diverse ros which was beneficial to the efficient removal of target contaminants in addition both the bioaccumulation factors and developmental toxicity of smt and its degradation intermediates were predicted by the toxicity estimation software tool t e s t liu et al 2019 wang et al 2020b among these intermediates the bioaccumulation factors of p4 and p5 could not be predicted as presented in fig 7b the smt intermediates exhibited slight enhancement in bioaccumulation compared with the original smt except for p2 and p6 especially the result of p7 19 97 which was 6 77 times higher than that of smt 2 57 might be due to its higher lipophilicity moreover developmental toxicity was adopted to evaluate whether these compounds have an adverse developmental toxicity effect on humans or animals peng et al 2021 smt was categorized as a developmental toxicant and the treatment process could reduce the developmental toxicity of the smt intermediates except for p5 fig 7c even more exciting was that the intermediates p1 1 p2 1 and p4 became developmental non toxic overall the above toxicity prediction indicated that the degradation of smt was accompanied by the formation of toxic intermediates despite the toxicity of most smt intermediates could be reduced by cufes2 spc process some intermediates still exhibited toxicity therefore the degradation duration needs to be prolonged to guarantee a higher extent of mineralization 4 conclusion in the present study the novel cufes2 spc process exerted excellent catalytic reactivity towards smt degradation in neutral reaction media under conditions of 0 5 g l cufes2 and 0 8 mm spc at ph 7 1 86 4 0 054 min 1 of smt could be degraded within 45 min the cufes2 spc process was confirmed as a multi ros process which enabled the generation of oh co3 o2 and 1o2 based on the quenching experiments and esr tests the generated oh through the traditional heterogeneous fenton like pathway would result in the generation of other ros in the presence of carbonate ions and contribute to the degradation of smt it was also found that the abundant surface bound fe ii dominated spc activation process simultaneously it was validated that the reductive sulfur species the interaction between cu i and fe iii as well as the available o2 produced by molecular oxygen activation and the conversion of oh favored the redox cycle of fe species on cufes2 surface moreover the cufes2 spc process exhibited acceptable removal efficiency of smt in the presence of inorganic anions and nom with relatively satisfactory reusability after regeneration treatment additionally the application of spc endowed the degradation process with robust stability and avoid the undesired acidification of effluents the toxicity evaluation demonstrated that the developmental toxicity and bioaccumulation factors of smt were reduced in a word the combination of transition metal sulfides with percarbonate paves a new avenue for establishing highly efficient heterogeneous catalytic processes toward antibiotic degradation declaration of competing interest the authors declare

16807,lanthanum modified bentonite lmb has been applied to eutrophic lakes to reduce phosphorus p concentrations in the water column and mitigate p release from sediments previous experiments suggest that natural organic matter nom can interfere with phosphate po4 binding to lmb and exacerbate lanthanum la release from bentonite this evidence served as motivation for this study to systematically determine the effects of nom solution ph and bentonite as a la carrier on p removal we conducted both geochemical modeling and controlled laboratory batch kinetic experiments to understand the ph dependent impacts of humic and fulvic acids on po4 binding to lmb and la release from lmb the role of bentonite was studied by comparing po4 removal obtained by lmb and la3 added as lacl3 salt to represent the la containing component of lmb our results from both geochemical modeling and batch experiments indicate that the po4 binding ability of lmb is decreased in the presence of nom and the decrease is more pronounced at ph 8 5 than at 6 at the highest evaluated nom concentration 28 mg c l 1 po4 removal by la3 was substantially lower than that by lmb implying that bentonite clay in lmb shielded la from interactions with nom while still allowing po4 capture by la finally the presence of nom promoted la release from lmb and the amount of la released depended on solution ph and both the type i e fulvic humic acid ratio and concentration of nom overall these results provide an important basis for management of p in lakes and eutrophication control that relies on lmb applications

limiting nutrient for algae in standing freshwater bodies such as lakes ponds and reservoirs conley et al 2009 cooke et al 2005 douglas et al 2016 schindler 1974 schindler et al 2016 management of p is therefore important to control excessive growth of phototrophic organisms to help lower p concentrations in eutrophic lakes in lake treatment techniques have been employed to remove orthophosphate po4 which is the sum of po4 3 and its protonated forms from the water column and inhibit release of mobile po4 from lake sediments cooke et al 2005 lanthanum la modified bentonite lmb commercially known as phoslock is an po4 binding product that has been applied to more than 200 water bodies copetti et al 2015 currently available data highlight its high specificity and efficacy for po4 binding in complex waters haghseresht et al 2009 he et al 2017 huang et al 2014 kurzbaum and bar shalom 2016 li et al 2019 min et al 2019 ross et al 2008 wasay et al 1996 mineralogical characterization of the reaction products from lmb contact with po4 in solution indicates the formation of insoluble lapo4 minerals dithmer et al 2015 if all la in lmb was available for po4 binding one mole of p would be removed by each mole of la added to the water column however recent studies have indicated that not all of the added la in lmb is available for po4 binding suggesting possible interferences from solutes or particulates in natural waters dithmer et al 2016 li et al 2020 lürling et al 2014 reitzel et al 2013 laboratory scale studies of lmb applied to real waters indicate that natural organic matter nom may constrain po4 binding by lmb dithmer et al 2016 douglas et al 2000 lai et al 2016 lürling et al 2014 song et al 2020 wu et al 2019 moreover nom can considerably alter the speciation distribution and mobility of la in aquatic environments chakraborty et al 2011 li et al 2020 moermond et al 2001 sholkovitz 1992 and accordingly affect the bioaccumulation and ecotoxicity of la and lmb das et al 1988 herrmann et al 2016 sun et al 1997 for example free la3 which is the most toxic form will likely bind to nom at circumneutral ph e g humic acid moermond et al 2001 tang and johannesson 2010 2003 thus in aquatic environments with high levels of natural ligands such as nom little to no uncomplexed la3 should be present lürling and tolman 2010 in this context it is critical to understand how nom interacts with lmb however past studies that evaluated nom effects relied on lake water samples in which other water quality parameters e g dissolved inorganic carbon may have confounded results and obscured the impact of nom on po4 removal and la release dithmer et al 2016 2015 lürling et al 2014 in addition the roles of ph and the clay carrier material of lmb i e bentonite are not well understood in the context of nom impacts on po4 removal by and la release from lmb we hypothesize that ph is an important parameter controlling lmb performance as ph affects 1 speciation of la binding sites of nom 2 speciation of aqueous la as well as solubility of la and 3 speciation of po4 sonke 2006 sonke and salters 2006 tang and johannesson 2003 tipping and tipping 2002 further in addition to the la present in lmb bentonite may interact with nom in addition to the la present in lmb but these interactions remain unexplored our overall objective was to obtain a better understanding of the effects of nom and ph on po4 binding by lmb more specifically our research objectives were to 1 investigate the roles of solution ph and nom type fulvic humic acid and concentration on po4 removal by la 2 assess the role of bentonite on po4 binding to lmb and 3 investigate roles of solution ph and nom on concentration of filterable la fla which refers to la in water after filtration release from lmb during po4 sequestration we conducted geochemical modeling as well as laboratory batch kinetic experiments in the models speciation profiles of p and la were assessed as a function of ph nom concentration and nom type i e ratio of fulvic acid humic acid fa ha laboratory batch experiments were performed with la3 lmb and four nom standards to validate model predictions given that effects from a changing climate are expected to lead to a brownification effect i e an increased release of terrestrial humic substance into surface waters ekvall et al 2013 monteith et al 2007 the results of this work will provide an important basis for lake management and eutrophication control that relies on lmb applications in the coming years 2 materials and methods

standard humic substances that were used to derive la nom complexation stability constants sonke 2006 sonke and salters 2006 these constants were used in model vii see section 2 2 to simulate la nom interactions tipping et al 2011 the elemental composition of the nom standards is listed in table s1 2 2 geochemical model the impact of nom on po4 removal by lmb was first evaluated by chemical equilibrium modeling using the program cheaqs pro verweij 2005 in this program formation of la complexes with ha or fa were modeled by model vii tipping 1998 tipping et al 2011 tipping and hurley 1992 model vii is a discrete site model for ha and fa ligands and uses carboxylic acid and phenolic groups as the two main binding sites detailed descriptions of the parameters of the model can be found in sonke 2006 and tipping et al 2011 the model calculations matched conditions in our batch experiments details in section 2 3 as follows 8 8 mg l 1 of la based on 200 mg l 1 of lmb containing 4 4 la and assuming all la in the bentonite is available to bind po4 and 2 mg l 1 of p at ph values of 6 7 and 8 5 the la p ratio corresponded to a molar ratio of 1 1 and possible solids were allowed to precipitate in model vii concentrations of nom were varied from 0 to 30 mg c l 1 in the organic complexation tab the fa fraction was set to 0 for lha and esha to 1 for srfa and to 0 73 for snom green et al 2015 additional details regarding model inputs for cheaqs pro are provided in table s2 2 3 batch experiments batch kinetic experiments were conducted to study po4 sequestration by lmb as a function of solution ph and initial nom concentration filterable la release over time was also monitored in these experiments four nom standards were dissolved in ultra pure water upw separately to give a stock concentration of 100 mg l 1 the ph of the nom stock solution was adjusted to 10 using 10 m naoh and mixed for 3 days by magnetic stirring the stock solutions were then filtered through glass fiber membranes 0 45 μm to remove suspended particles phosphate stock solutions 500 mg p l 1 were prepared by dissolving nah2po4 h2o in co2 free upw batch kinetic experiments were conducted in duplicate according to the following steps first four nom standards were prepared by diluting their respective nom stock solutions with upw using 249 ml of each nom standard each with three working

second 1 ml of po4 stock solution was spiked into each nom solution to achieve an initial p concentration of 2 mg l 1 third initial solution ph was adjusted to 8 5 with 1 m solutions of naoh or hcl the volume of acid base added was 0 5 v v of each experiment finally 50 mg of lmb solid was added to each hdpe bottle 200 mg l 1 and the ph of the solution was re adjusted to 8 5 bottles were capped immediately and shaken horizontally on a reciprocating shaker at 21 relative centrifugal force and 25 c the experiments were carried out in batches and the duration time of each test varied from 400 to 552 h 5 8 samples were collected in the first 48 h as the po4 concentration decreased rapidly the sampling time interval became longer 50 100 h when changes in po4 concentrations became smaller at each sampling time an aliquot was collected from each bottle and filtered through a 0 45 μm pvdf membrane before analysis also the ph of the remaining suspension was measured and adjusted back to the target ph δph of 0 05 0 5 was the deviation that required adjustment after each sampling when apparent equilibrium was reached an aliquot was collected and sequentially filtered through 0 45 μm and 0 1 μm pvdf membranes filtrates were analyzed for p and la as described in section 2 4 to evaluate ph dependence kinetic experiments were carried out with nom e g lha concentrations of 0 5 5 and 28 mg c l 1 at ph 6 7 and 8 5 the ph values were selected within the environmentally relevant ph range as described above the ph of the nom lmb solutions was checked and adjusted daily to maintain the target ph to identify the role of bentonite clay in the lmb matrix kinetic experiments were repeated in the same manner with la3 lacl3 salt as source in the presence of nom three concentration levels 0 5 5 and 28 mg c l 1 at ph values of 6 7 and 8 5 the initial p concentration was 2 mg l 1 the dosage of lacl3 used was equivalent to that of la in lmb ensuring an identical amount of la in the system i e 8 8 mg la l 1 the corresponding percentage of po4 removed was calculated by dividing the final concentration by the measured starting concentration and compared with model predictions it was expected to be close to 100 as p and la were dosed to the 1 1 molar ratio po4 concentrations with lmb or lacl3 treatment under three ph levels were statistically evaluated via repeated measures anovas followed by tukey post hoc tests using spss ibm spss statistics 2 4 analysis of aqueous species concentrations of po4 in the range of 0 02 2 5 mg p l 1 were analyzed with the molybdovanadate method hach low range reactive phosphorus test n tube vials with a hach dr500 spectrometer samples with po4 concentration below 0 02 mg p l 1 were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes icap 7600 thermo bremen germany selected water samples after filtration 0 45 or 0 1 µm pvdf and acidification 2 v v hno3 were also analyzed by icp oes to quantify fla release during po4 sequestration to estimate the la content of lmb 200 mg l 1 of lmb was added to hno3 5 m in 250 ml bottles in triplicate and the bottles were shaken vigorously on a microplate shaker fisherbrand for 3 days filterable la in the solution after filtration 0 45 µm pvdf was determined by icp oes the method reporting limit for p by molybdovanadate method was 0 02 mg l 1 and reporting limits for p and la analysis by icp oes were 1 87 μg l 1 and 0 04 μg l 1 respectively measured concentrations of la using icp oes represent fla i e colloidal and aqueous la in water samples to distinguish between la concentrations determined by icp oes and aqueous la the levels determined by icp oes in the filtrate after 0 45 µm or 0 1 µm filtration was termed fla whereas the total dissolved la obtained from geochemical models e g la3 aq laoh2 aq and other inorganic complexes was termed aqueous la aq la 3 results 3 1 chemical equilibrium modeling of po4 removal by la salt we first assessed po4 removal by lmb as a function of ph and initial nom concentration through geochemical equilibrium simulations since equilibrium models do not include lmb or bentonite clay as possible inputs we used la3 i e the la containing component of lmb to represent lmb the model thus does not consider interactions between solutes including po4 and nom and the bentonite lmb carrier matrix all simulations were conducted with 8 8 mg la l 1 based on 200 mg l 1 of lmb containing 4 4 la and assuming all la in the bentonite is available to bind po4 the starting po4 concentration was 2 mg l 1 of p resulting in a molar la p ratio of 1 1 in the model outputs we focused on the formed concentrations of lapo4 s i e the dominant product of po4 removal by la copetti et al 2015 dithmer et al 2015 zhi et al 2020 and aqueous total dissolved p aq p i e the po4 that was not removed in the absence of nom the model indicated that nearly all the aq p would be removed as lapo4 s at ph 6 7 and 8 5 fig 1 a b as ha or fa concentrations increased from 0 to 30 mg c l 1 the predicted formation of lapo4 s decreased resulting in higher aq p concentrations fig 1a b furthermore the nom impact was more pronounced at higher solution ph fig 1a b and highlighted by blue arrow in fig 1a at ph 8 5 no po4 removal was predicted for ha 19 mg c l 1 fig 1a or fa 16 mg c l 1 fig 1b the impacts of ha and fa on po4 removal differed across the evaluated ph range 6 8 5 a 50 reduction in po4 removal at ph 8 5 was predicted to occur with 8 75 mg c l 1 of ha green diamond fig 1a or 6 25 mg c l 1 of fa violet triangle fig 1b at ph 6 24 8 mg c l 1 of ha blue circle fig 1a or 30 mg c l 1 of fa would lead to this same level of reduction in po4 removal at ph 7 the effect of fa and ha was comparable requiring 13 mg c l 1 of ha or fa for a 50 reduction indicated by the yellow star and orange square in fig 1a b it is worth noting that the model does not allow for the formation of ternary nom la po4 as the possible occurrence and stability of the complexes is unknown however the existence of analogous nom fe po4 ternary complexes is well known hesterberg 2010 3 2 batch experiments of po4 removal by lmb and influence of nom to evaluate po4 removal by lmb we conducted batch kinetic experiments with varying initial nom concentrations and a fixed concentration of lmb and po4 at ph values of 6 7 and 8 5 we first established baseline po4 removal data in the absence of nom by conducting batch tests in upw there were no significant differences p 0 908 in po4 removal kinetics and concentrations at apparent equilibrium at ph 6 7 and 8 5 when nom was absent fig s1 these results were consistent with the modeling results fig 1 in the presence of nom po4 removal decreased and the magnitude of the decrease was dependent on the concentration of nom and the solution ph at each sampling point the concentration of po4 in the reactors with 28 mg c l 1 of lha was always higher than that in reactors with 5 5 mg c l 1 and 0 mg c l 1 of lha fig 2 this trend held true even after 420 444 h at a lha concentration of 5 5 mg c l 1 p removal decreased as solution ph was increased from 6 to 8 5 a trend that was consistent with that predicted by the model fig 1 however at a lha concentration of 28 mg c l 1 p removal was not affected as solution ph was increased from 6 to 8 5 at ph 8 5 model predictions suggested that p removal would be negligible but p removal in the experiment was 60 this discrepancy will be discussed further below additional tests were completed with the nom standards esha srfa and snom to determine if their effects were consistent with lha fig s2 these kinetic experiments were carried out at ph 8 5 as the effect of nom was predicted to be most pronounced at ph 8 5 fig 1 results show that the po4 removal profiles in the presence of esha srfa and snom fig s2 closely matched those obtained with lha fig 2c one exception was esha at 22 mg c l 1 which adversely impacted p removal more strongly that the other nom types but still less than what was predicted by the model at ph 8 5 average p concentration after 400 h ranged from 0 13 to 0 27 mg p l 1 in upw from 0 41 to 0 51 mg p l 1 at 5 mg c l 1 and from 0 52 to 0 94 at 26 mg c l 1 figs 2c and s2 3 3 comparison between model predictions and experimental results of po4 removal we compared the aforementioned experimental results with the model predictions section 3 1 in the absence of nom our experimentally measured po4 removal after filtration through a 0 45 µm filter ranged from 84 to 87 fig 3 a c which was lower than the essentially complete removal we had anticipated based on model predictions shown in fig 1 we explored whether the discrepancy might be attributable to fine lmb or lapo4 s particles that may have passed through the 0 45 µm filters leading to an underestimation of aqueous po4 removal to test this hypothesis we filtered our samples a second time through 0 1 µm filters po4 removal increased slightly to 87 89 ph 8 5 after this additional filtration step fig 3a but remained below the essentially complete removal we had expected based on model predictions shown in fig 1 we then measured the la content of lmb in triplicate and found that the la content was 3 74 0 08 wt which is lower than the value of 4 4 wt that had been reported in prior publications dithmer et al 2016 lürling et al 2014 reitzel et al 2017 the experimentally determined la content of lmb results in 7 5 mg la l 1 rather than the originally expected 8 8 mg l 1 at 200 mg lmb l 1 when the model was corrected to this la concentration it predicted 85 po4 removal in the absence of nom at equilibrium which agreed well with our experimental data fig 3a c for experiments conducted with lmb the difference between experimental results and model predictions increased as solution ph and nom concentration increased fig 3a c model predictions and empirical observations showed the best agreement at ph 6 fig 3a however with 5 6 mg c l 1 of lha the model predicted po4 removals of 66 at ph 7 and 45 at ph 8 5 which were systematically lower than experimentally determined removals 81 84 at ph 7 and 76 81 at ph 8 5 fig 3b c when the lha concentration was increased to 28 mg c l 1 the discrepancy between model predictions and experimentally determined values became more pronounced red and blue boxes fig 3b c predicted po4 removal was 6 at ph 7 and 0 at ph 8 5 while experimentally determined removals were 66 72 at ph 7 and 74 77 at ph 8 5 highlighted by red and blue arrows fig 3b c experimental results for the other three nom standards esha srfa snom fig s3a c were also compared with model predictions under the same corresponding conditions i e solution ph ha fa ratio and concentration of nom the results were similar to those obtained with lha in that in the absence of nom the empirical po4 removal was 89 96 which was greater than the model prediction of 85 fig s3 in the presence of nom the empirical po4 removal was also greater than the model prediction at the highest concentration of all three nom types predicted po4 removal was essentially zero at ph 8 5 and all la was predicted to be complexed by nom either ha or fa fig 1 however significant po4 removal by lmb 52 83 was observed during the experiments figs s2 s3 3 4 po4 removal by dissolved la3 in the presence of nom to understand the role of bentonite in po4 removal by lmb additional batch experiments were performed in which la3 was added as a soluble lacl3 salt instead of lmb to eliminate the bentonite phase model results were again compared with experimental results fig 3d f in the absence of lha po4 removal by lacl3 was 99 close to the predicted value 100 this result was expected because la and po4 were dosed at a molar ratio of la p 1 1 in the presence of lha 5 6 mg c l 1 at ph 6 the empirical po4 removal was similar to the model prediction fig 3d at ph 7 sequential filtration resulted in a difference in percentage of po4 removed the empirical po4 removal after 0 45 µm filtration 56 was lower than that predicted by the model 78 whereas the removal after 0 1 µm filtration 89 was higher than that predicted by the model fig 3e at ph 8 5 the empirical po4 removal was 89 which was greater than the model prediction 53 at the highest lha concentration 28 mg c l 1 empirically determined po4 removals by la3 decreased from 38 at ph 6 to 6 at ph 8 5 and results at ph 7 and 8 5 were more consistent with model predictions compared to those obtained with lmb comparing fig 3a c with d f with 28 mg c l 1 of lha po4 removal by la3 was significantly lower than by lmb especially at ph 7 and 8 5 as highlighted by red and blue boxes respectively in fig 3 more specifically lmb removed 59 77 of po4 whereas po4 removal by la3 was 6 17 this discrepancy will be discussed further below 3 5 filterable la release from lmb to assess the effects of ph and nom on la release from lmb we conducted batch experiments with lmb 200 mg l 1 in 1 upw amended with lha 0 5 5 28 mg c l 1 at ph 8 5 and 2 upw amended with po4 2 mg p l 1 and lha 0 5 5 28 mg c l 1 at ph 6 7 and 8 5 in upw at ph 8 5 no nom no po4 the concentration of fla i e total la passing through a 0 45 µm filter was 1 2 1 1 µg l 1 in the presence of 5 5 and 28 mg c l 1 lha the concentrations of fla were 986 125 µg l 1 and 3430 44 µg l 1 respectively 1 fig 4 a the addition of po4 decreased the concentration of fla in solutions amended with lha especially at the highest lha dose at which the fla concentration decreased to about one third 1180 µg l 1 of that observed in the absence of po4 figs 4b and s4 to understand the effect of solution ph experiments were conducted at the same lha concentrations with ph controlled at 6 7 and 8 5 fig 4b d similar to fig 4a the amount of la that was released from the lmb matrix at the three ph values increased with increasing lha concentration at 5 5 mg c l 1 of lha the concentration of fla increased with increasing ph while at 28 mg c l 1 of lha the concentration of fla increased with decreasing ph fig s4 la release experiments were also carried out with esha srfa and snom at a ph of 8 5 fig s5 similar to lha the other three nom standards caused enhanced la release as determined by fla from lmb and la release increased as the concentration of nom increased fig s5 in contrast to lha fla gradually increased over time in the presence of esha and snom fig s5 suggesting the release of la or the complexation reaction with nom is a dynamic process further inspection of figs 4 and s5 revealed that concentrations of fla in the presence of different nom standards i e lha esha srfa and snom at apparent equilibrium were different p 0 001 as shown in figs 4 and s5 the amount of fla released from the lmb matrix depended on the type i e fa ha ratio and concentration of nom sequential filtration through filters with 0 45 and 0 1 µm pore sizes confirmed that the concentration of fla decreased as the pore size of the filter membrane decreased fig s4 which was consistent with the po4 removal experiments fig 3 the presence of fla that passes through a 0 45 µm but not a 0 1 µm filter suggests the presence of colloidal particles containing la in the form of lapo4 la nom and or lmb additionally there may also be particulate forms containing la that are larger than 0 45 µm including la nom particles and thus the discrepancy between modeled la and fla shown in fig s4 is not unexpected experimental results obtained with lmb are consistent with geochemical model results in that the model predicted enhanced formation of la nom complexes with increasing nom concentrations figs s4 and s6 moreover model predictions show that the concentrations of aq la defined here as the sum concentration of la3 laoh2 aq and other inorganic complexes were 10 15 10 7 mg l 1 and concentrations decreased with increasing concentration of nom such decreases in aq la were accompanied by decreases in lapo4 and increases in la nom concentration until all la bonded with nom fig s6 4 discussion 4 1 ph dependent effect of nom on po4 sequestration both modeling and experimental results indicate thatpo4 removal decreased in the presence of nom these findings are consistent with previous studies in which humic substances or dissolved organic carbon adversely affected po4 removal after 400 days dithmer et al 2016 and 42 days lürling et al 2014 moreover the magnitude of the decrease was dependent on the concentration and type of nom and the solution ph figs 1 3 s2 and s3 nom contains both relatively strong acidic pka of 3 3 4 0 and weak acidic groups pka 6 as well as a few bidentate sites as major ligands sonke 2006 tipping and hurley 1992 that can compete with po4 for la fig 5 a binding of ions by humic substances such as complexation between nom and la can be described as a metal proton exchange reaction l a 3 nom h la nom h where ph plays an important role tipping et al 2011 tipping and tipping 2002 our findings with lacl3 fig 3d f support the ph dependent effect of nom on po4 binding to la which was least pronounced at ph 6 and most pronounced at ph 8 5 at higher ph weaker acidic groups of nom become deprotonated increasing their ability to bind more la and therefore resulting in more pronounced interference of nom on po4 removal as solution ph increases fig 5b per figs 1 3 s2 and s3 the effects of ha and fa on po4 removal by lmb were not identical p 0 001 and varied with ph p 0 001 which can be attributed to differences in the abundance of mono and bi dentate binding sites intrinsic proton dissociation constant and electrostatic parameters sonke 2006 tipping 1998 it is worth again noting the possible presence of nom la po4 depending on the size of these complexes e g their ability to pass through a 0 45 or 0 1 µm filter the presence of colloid may result in an increase or decrease in po4 concentration in the filterable fraction affecting estimates or removal efficiency given the underprediction of fla as compared to modeled la nom complexes it is reasonable to think that any ternary nom la po4 complexes may contribute to reduced po4 removal efficiency compared to the model however the expected impact of ternary complexes does not explain the difference between the po4 removal efficiency of lacl3 and lmb 4 2 effect of bentonite clay to understand the role of bentonite po4 removal experiments were conducted with la3 and lmb a comparison of lmb i e la3 incorporated in bentonite matrix and la3 i e with the soluble salt lacl3 as a la source demonstrates that greater po4 removal occurred at the highest evaluated nom concentration when bentonite was present as a carrier material the higher removal percentages that were obtained with lmb imply that bentonite reduces la nom interactions while allowing po4 sequestration by la this enhanced efficiency may be explained in terms of the sorption reactivity of the bentonite clay itself although po4 may adsorb to clay minerals bentonite type clays have a low affinity for po4 at ph 8 suggesting direct adsorption to the surface is not the dominant mechanism for enhanced po4 removal by lmb as compared to lacl3 this low adsorption affinity can be rationalized by noting the overall negative charge pzc 3 2 sperry and peirce 1999 of montmorillonite the dominant mineral in bentonite and hence repulsive electrostatic interactions with hpo4 2 however bentonite may also adsorb nom potentially reducing its ability to compete with po4 for la as demonstrated in li et al 2020 nom can be adsorbed by lmb in the presence of po4 in addition chen et al 2017 noted significant adsorption maximum sorbed concentration 6 7 mg c m 2 of a soil humic acid on montmorillonite even at ph 8 which was attributed to ligand exchange and hydrophobic interactions based on the sorption capacity of montmorillonite and assuming a lmb surface area of 29 m2 g 1 baninaam et al 2020 the maximum mass of nom that may be sorbed by bentonite in our system can be estimated as 9 7 mg c which exceed the maximum mass of carbon in even our highest concentrations experiments 7 mg c the sorption of nom by bentonite may thus reduce the effective concentration of nom in solution reducing its ability to compete with po4 for la 4 3 nom influence on la release soluble la released from lmb into aquatic environments is undesirable and may potentially lead to adverse ecological impacts copetti et al 2015 gonzalez et al 2014 published studies have reported that ecotoxicological effects are not expected below a predicted no effect concentration pnec of 4 µg l 1 herrmann et al 2016 further in the netherlands la is subjected to a maximum permissible concentration mpc legislation that is applied to the water column and sediments van oosterhout et al 2020 the netherlands is the only country that has la standards for water and sediment sneller et al 2000 and the maximum permissible fla concentration is 10 1 μg l 1 in surface waters crommentuijn et al 2000 however this mpc was derived from the no observed effect concentration noec determined in a 21 day daphnia reproduction test and divided by 10 van oosterhout et al 2020 the results from our study showed that in upw fla in equilibrium with 200 mg l 1 of lmb 1 2 1 1 µg l 1 fig 4a was below the safety threshold i e pnec of 4 µg l 1 as well as regulatory standards i e 10 1 μg l 1 in addition our results of la release are in agreement with tang and johannesson 2010 who studied la release from sediment in the absence of strong la complexing ligands in solution the amount of la released from the sediment is small tang and johannesson 2010 however la releasing was much more pronounced in the presence of strong complexing ligands tang and johannesson 2010 consistent with our findings for nom here our experimental observations support the hypothesis that nom can influence the concentration of fla in the water column fig 4 this agrees with previous studies that have shown that 1 nom i e fa and ha strongly binds la and la nom complexes dominate la speciation in surface waters within the ph range of 5 4 7 9 tang and johannesson 2003 and estuarine waters moermond et al 2001 and 2 ha can dissolve la in the lmb by complexation as illustrated in fig 5d lürling et al 2014 reitzel et al 2017 a previous study that used sequential filtration demonstrated that la could bind to negatively charged regions of ha leading to the formation of colloidal la ha complexes reitzel et al 2017 the authors observed that up to 14 of fla was released from lmb in soft water lakes with high ha concentration with 400 mg l 1 of lmb and 22 mg c l 1 reitzel et al 2017 their findings are comparable with ours wherein 4 10 of la was released at 5 5 mg c l 1 of lha and 13 30 of la was released at 28 mg c l 1 of lha with 200 mg l 1 of lmb in our study further we found the presence of po4 limited fla concentrations even in the presence of nom we therefore conclude that the concentration of fla is strongly dependent on the concentrations of nom and po4 consistent with previous investigations our experiments show that concentrations of fla are dependent on the size of pores used during sample filtration fla concentrations declined as the pore diameters decreased fig s4 reitzel et al 2017 detectable fla remained in the aqueous phase after filtration through both 0 45 and 0 1 μm membrane filters reitzel et al 2017 demonstrated that fla concentrations in some samples were as high as 2 mg l 1 and there was detectable fla even after 30 min of ultracentrifuge 62 000 g collectively these results indicate that careful attention to separation methodologies is critical for determining accurate concentrations of fla one interesting point of discussion is the speciation of fla it is an important question for lake managers whether the fla should be considered as truly dissolved la or rather as small nontoxic colloids containing la among all possible la species ionic la3 has the greatest potential to cause ecotoxicological impacts across various studies copetti et al 2015 das et al 1988 gonzalez et al 2014 herrmann et al 2016 on the contrary la complexation with nom will reduce the bioavailability of la and therefore its associated ecotoxicity gonzalez et al 2014 herrmann et al 2016 based on our model results the concentration of ionic la3 is 10 7 mg l 1 at all conditions fig s6 with 8 8 mg la l 1 2 mg p l 1 ph 6 7 8 5 and nom concentration 0 30 mg c l 1 in cases where la is limited and strong ligands nom and po4 are present ionic la3 will likely be depleted and not contribute substantially to fla in addition as reported by previous studies fla concentrations in filtered samples depend on pore size of the filter suggesting that various colloidal forms of la are present lürling et al 2014 reitzel et al 2017 van oosterhout et al 2020 moreover in hard water lakes and in eutrophic waters with elevated ph reitzel et al 2017 found from sequential filtration and ultracentrifugation that virtually all fla will be colloidal reitzel et al 2017 this speciation was attributed to la precipitates with bi carbonate at higher alkalinity and insoluble la hydroxide forms at elevated ph in contrast in soft water lakes with high nom content most of the fla was on a dissolved form and likely associated with nom reitzel et al 2017 generally how much truly dissolved la3 will be present in fla depends on water chemistry 5 conclusions in this study we evaluated the impacts of natural organic matter nom on po4 binding to lanthanum modified bentonite lmb and la release from the lmb matrix as a function of solution ph by using chemical equilibrium modeling and controlled laboratory batch kinetic experiments we found that po4 removal decreased in the presence of nom and the magnitude of the decrease was dependent on the concentration of nom type of nom and ph the bentonite matrix may adsorb nom and reduce la nom interactions contributing to lmb efficacy for po4 removal in neutral to alkaline waters with high nom in the presence of 28 mg c l 1 lmb removed 59 74 po4 at conditions at which free la3 was not able to achieve meaningful po4 removal the presence of nom also enhanced the release of la from the lmb matrix although po4 can limit the amount of fla in the water overall these findings provide an important basis for the use of lmb to manage phosphorous and eutrophication problems in lakes and other water bodies future research efforts should focus on evaluating the effectiveness of lmb as an effective p removal strategy in parallel with efforts to evaluate its broader environmental and societal impacts particularly for in situ applications among other research areas more work is needed to better understand la release from lmb including underlying mechanisms for release in a range of environmental contexts including in waters with high nom and low phosphate concentrations declaration of

16807,lanthanum modified bentonite lmb has been applied to eutrophic lakes to reduce phosphorus p concentrations in the water column and mitigate p release from sediments previous experiments suggest that natural organic matter nom can interfere with phosphate po4 binding to lmb and exacerbate lanthanum la release from bentonite this evidence served as motivation for this study to systematically determine the effects of nom solution ph and bentonite as a la carrier on p removal we conducted both geochemical modeling and controlled laboratory batch kinetic experiments to understand the ph dependent impacts of humic and fulvic acids on po4 binding to lmb and la release from lmb the role of bentonite was studied by comparing po4 removal obtained by lmb and la3 added as lacl3 salt to represent the la containing component of lmb our results from both geochemical modeling and batch experiments indicate that the po4 binding ability of lmb is decreased in the presence of nom and the decrease is more pronounced at ph 8 5 than at 6 at the highest evaluated nom concentration 28 mg c l 1 po4 removal by la3 was substantially lower than that by lmb implying that bentonite clay in lmb shielded la from interactions with nom while still allowing po4 capture by la finally the presence of nom promoted la release from lmb and the amount of la released depended on solution ph and both the type i e fulvic humic acid ratio and concentration of nom overall these results provide an important basis for management of p in lakes and eutrophication control that relies on lmb applications

limiting nutrient for algae in standing freshwater bodies such as lakes ponds and reservoirs conley et al 2009 cooke et al 2005 douglas et al 2016 schindler 1974 schindler et al 2016 management of p is therefore important to control excessive growth of phototrophic organisms to help lower p concentrations in eutrophic lakes in lake treatment techniques have been employed to remove orthophosphate po4 which is the sum of po4 3 and its protonated forms from the water column and inhibit release of mobile po4 from lake sediments cooke et al 2005 lanthanum la modified bentonite lmb commercially known as phoslock is an po4 binding product that has been applied to more than 200 water bodies copetti et al 2015 currently available data highlight its high specificity and efficacy for po4 binding in complex waters haghseresht et al 2009 he et al 2017 huang et al 2014 kurzbaum and bar shalom 2016 li et al 2019 min et al 2019 ross et al 2008 wasay et al 1996 mineralogical characterization of the reaction products from lmb contact with po4 in solution indicates the formation of insoluble lapo4 minerals dithmer et al 2015 if all la in lmb was available for po4 binding one mole of p would be removed by each mole of la added to the water column however recent studies have indicated that not all of the added la in lmb is available for po4 binding suggesting possible interferences from solutes or particulates in natural waters dithmer et al 2016 li et al 2020 lürling et al 2014 reitzel et al 2013 laboratory scale studies of lmb applied to real waters indicate that natural organic matter nom may constrain po4 binding by lmb dithmer et al 2016 douglas et al 2000 lai et al 2016 lürling et al 2014 song et al 2020 wu et al 2019 moreover nom can considerably alter the speciation distribution and mobility of la in aquatic environments chakraborty et al 2011 li et al 2020 moermond et al 2001 sholkovitz 1992 and accordingly affect the bioaccumulation and ecotoxicity of la and lmb das et al 1988 herrmann et al 2016 sun et al 1997 for example free la3 which is the most toxic form will likely bind to nom at circumneutral ph e g humic acid moermond et al 2001 tang and johannesson 2010 2003 thus in aquatic environments with high levels of natural ligands such as nom little to no uncomplexed la3 should be present lürling and tolman 2010 in this context it is critical to understand how nom interacts with lmb however past studies that evaluated nom effects relied on lake water samples in which other water quality parameters e g dissolved inorganic carbon may have confounded results and obscured the impact of nom on po4 removal and la release dithmer et al 2016 2015 lürling et al 2014 in addition the roles of ph and the clay carrier material of lmb i e bentonite are not well understood in the context of nom impacts on po4 removal by and la release from lmb we hypothesize that ph is an important parameter controlling lmb performance as ph affects 1 speciation of la binding sites of nom 2 speciation of aqueous la as well as solubility of la and 3 speciation of po4 sonke 2006 sonke and salters 2006 tang and johannesson 2003 tipping and tipping 2002 further in addition to the la present in lmb bentonite may interact with nom in addition to the la present in lmb but these interactions remain unexplored our overall objective was to obtain a better understanding of the effects of nom and ph on po4 binding by lmb more specifically our research objectives were to 1 investigate the roles of solution ph and nom type fulvic humic acid and concentration on po4 removal by la 2 assess the role of bentonite on po4 binding to lmb and 3 investigate roles of solution ph and nom on concentration of filterable la fla which refers to la in water after filtration release from lmb during po4 sequestration we conducted geochemical modeling as well as laboratory batch kinetic experiments in the models speciation profiles of p and la were assessed as a function of ph nom concentration and nom type i e ratio of fulvic acid humic acid fa ha laboratory batch experiments were performed with la3 lmb and four nom standards to validate model predictions given that effects from a changing climate are expected to lead to a brownification effect i e an increased release of terrestrial humic substance into surface waters ekvall et al 2013 monteith et al 2007 the results of this work will provide an important basis for lake management and eutrophication control that relies on lmb applications in the coming years 2 materials and methods

equilibrium modeling using the program cheaqs pro verweij 2005 in this program formation of la complexes with ha or fa were modeled by model vii tipping 1998 tipping et al 2011 tipping and hurley 1992 model vii is a discrete site model for ha and fa ligands and uses carboxylic acid and phenolic groups as the two main binding sites detailed descriptions of the parameters of the model can be found in

assuming all la in the bentonite is available to bind po4 and 2 mg l 1 of p at ph values of 6 7 and 8 5 the la p ratio corresponded to a molar ratio of 1 1 and possible solids were allowed to precipitate in model vii concentrations of nom were varied from 0 to 30 mg c l 1 in the organic complexation tab the fa fraction was set to 0 for lha and esha to 1 for srfa and to 0 73 for snom green et al 2015 additional details regarding model inputs for cheaqs pro are provided in table s2 2 3 batch experiments batch kinetic experiments were conducted to study po4 sequestration by lmb as a function of solution ph and initial nom concentration filterable la release over time was also monitored in these experiments four nom standards were dissolved in ultra pure water upw separately to give a stock concentration of 100 mg l 1 the ph of the nom stock solution was adjusted to 10 using 10 m naoh and mixed for 3 days by magnetic stirring the stock solutions were then filtered through glass fiber membranes 0 45 μm to remove suspended particles phosphate stock solutions 500 mg p l 1 were prepared by dissolving nah2po4 h2o in co2 free upw batch kinetic experiments were conducted in duplicate according to the following steps first four nom standards were prepared by diluting their respective nom stock solutions with upw using 249 ml of each nom standard each with three working

second 1 ml of po4 stock solution was spiked into each nom solution to achieve an initial p concentration of 2 mg l 1 third initial solution ph was adjusted to 8 5 with 1 m solutions of naoh or hcl the volume of acid base added was 0 5 v v of each experiment finally 50 mg of lmb solid was added to each hdpe bottle 200 mg l 1 and the ph of the solution was re adjusted to 8 5 bottles were capped immediately and shaken horizontally on a reciprocating shaker at 21 relative centrifugal force and 25 c the experiments were carried out in batches and the duration time of each test varied from 400 to 552 h 5 8 samples were collected in the first 48 h as the po4 concentration decreased rapidly the sampling time interval became longer 50 100 h when changes in po4 concentrations became smaller at each sampling time an aliquot was collected from each bottle and filtered through a 0 45 μm pvdf membrane before analysis also the ph of the remaining suspension was measured and adjusted back to the target ph δph of 0 05 0 5 was the deviation that required adjustment after each sampling when apparent equilibrium was reached an aliquot was collected and sequentially filtered through 0 45 μm and 0 1 μm pvdf membranes filtrates were analyzed for p and la as described in section 2 4 to evaluate ph dependence kinetic experiments were carried out with nom e g lha concentrations of 0 5 5 and 28 mg c l 1 at ph 6 7 and 8 5 the ph values were selected within the environmentally relevant ph range as described above the ph of the nom lmb solutions was checked and adjusted daily to maintain the target ph to identify the role of bentonite clay in the lmb matrix kinetic experiments were repeated in the same manner with la3 lacl3 salt as source in the presence of nom three concentration levels 0 5 5 and 28 mg c l 1 at ph values of 6 7 and 8 5 the initial p concentration was 2 mg l 1 the dosage of lacl3 used was equivalent to that of la in lmb ensuring an identical amount of la in the system i e 8 8 mg la l 1 the corresponding percentage of po4 removed was calculated by dividing the final concentration by the measured starting concentration and compared with model predictions it was expected to be close to 100 as p and la were dosed to the 1 1 molar ratio po4 concentrations with lmb or lacl3 treatment under three ph levels were statistically evaluated via repeated measures anovas followed by tukey post hoc tests using spss ibm spss statistics 2 4 analysis of aqueous species concentrations of po4 in the range of 0 02 2 5 mg p l 1 were analyzed with the molybdovanadate method hach low range

sequestration to estimate the la content of lmb 200 mg l 1 of lmb was added to hno3 5 m in 250 ml bottles in triplicate and the bottles were shaken vigorously on a microplate shaker fisherbrand for 3 days filterable la in the solution after filtration 0 45 µm pvdf was determined by icp oes the method reporting limit for p by molybdovanadate method was 0 02 mg l 1 and reporting limits for p and la

concentrations determined by icp oes and aqueous la the levels determined by icp oes in the filtrate after 0 45 µm or 0 1 µm filtration was termed fla whereas the total dissolved la obtained from geochemical models e g la3 aq laoh2 aq and other inorganic complexes was termed aqueous la aq la 3 results 3 1 chemical equilibrium modeling of po4 removal by la salt we first assessed po4 removal by lmb as a function of ph and initial nom concentration through geochemical equilibrium simulations since equilibrium models do not include lmb or bentonite clay as possible inputs we used la3 i e the la containing component of lmb to represent lmb the model thus does not consider interactions between solutes including po4 and nom and the bentonite lmb carrier matrix all simulations were conducted with 8 8 mg la l 1 based on 200 mg l 1 of lmb containing 4 4 la and assuming all la in the bentonite is available to bind po4 the starting po4 concentration was 2 mg l 1 of p resulting in a molar la p ratio of 1 1 in the model outputs we focused on the formed concentrations of lapo4 s i e the dominant product of po4 removal by la copetti et al 2015 dithmer et al 2015 zhi et al 2020 and aqueous total dissolved p aq p i e the po4 that was not removed in the absence of nom the model indicated that nearly all the aq p would be removed as lapo4 s at ph 6 7 and 8 5 fig 1 a b as ha or fa concentrations increased from 0 to 30 mg c l 1 the predicted formation of lapo4 s decreased resulting in higher aq p concentrations fig 1a b furthermore the nom impact was more pronounced at higher solution ph fig 1a b and highlighted by blue arrow in fig 1a at ph 8 5 no po4 removal was predicted for ha 19 mg c l 1 fig 1a or fa 16 mg c l 1 fig 1b the impacts of ha and fa on po4 removal differed across the evaluated ph range 6 8 5 a 50 reduction in po4 removal at ph 8 5 was predicted to occur with 8 75 mg c l 1 of ha green diamond fig 1a or 6 25 mg c l 1 of fa violet triangle fig 1b at ph 6 24 8 mg c l 1 of ha blue circle fig 1a or 30 mg c l 1 of fa would lead to this same level of reduction in po4 removal at ph 7 the effect of fa and ha was comparable requiring 13 mg c l 1 of ha or fa for a 50 reduction indicated by the yellow star and orange square in fig 1a b it is worth noting that the model does not allow for the formation of ternary nom la po4 as the possible occurrence and stability of the complexes is unknown however the existence of analogous nom fe po4 ternary complexes is well known hesterberg 2010 3 2 batch experiments of po4 removal by lmb and influence of nom to evaluate po4 removal by lmb we conducted batch kinetic experiments with varying initial nom concentrations and a fixed concentration of lmb and po4 at ph values of 6 7 and 8 5 we first established baseline po4 removal data in the absence of nom by conducting batch tests in upw there were no significant differences p 0 908 in po4 removal kinetics and concentrations at apparent equilibrium at ph 6 7 and 8 5 when nom was absent fig s1 these results were consistent with the modeling results fig 1 in the presence of nom po4 removal decreased and the magnitude of the decrease was dependent on the concentration of nom and the solution ph at each sampling point the concentration of po4 in the reactors with 28 mg c l 1 of lha was always higher than that in reactors with 5 5 mg c l 1 and 0 mg c l 1 of lha fig 2 this trend held true even after 420 444 h at a lha concentration of 5 5 mg c l 1 p removal decreased as solution ph was increased from 6 to 8 5 a trend that was consistent with that predicted by the model fig 1 however at a lha concentration of 28 mg c l 1 p removal was not affected as solution ph was increased from 6 to 8 5 at ph 8 5 model predictions suggested that p removal would be negligible but p removal in the experiment was 60 this discrepancy will be discussed further below additional tests were completed with the nom standards esha srfa and snom to determine if their effects were consistent with lha fig s2 these kinetic experiments were carried out at ph 8 5 as the effect of nom was predicted to be most pronounced at ph 8 5 fig 1 results show that the po4 removal profiles in the presence of esha srfa and snom fig s2 closely matched those obtained with lha fig 2c one exception was esha at 22 mg c l 1 which adversely impacted p removal more strongly that the other nom types but still less than what was predicted by the model at ph 8 5 average p concentration after 400 h ranged from 0 13 to 0 27 mg p l 1 in upw from 0 41 to 0 51 mg p l 1 at 5 mg c l 1 and from 0 52 to 0 94 at 26 mg c l 1 figs 2c and s2 3 3 comparison between model predictions and experimental results of po4 removal we compared the aforementioned experimental results with the model predictions section 3 1 in the absence of nom our experimentally measured po4 removal after filtration through a 0 45 µm filter ranged from 84 to 87 fig 3 a c which was lower than the essentially complete removal we had anticipated based on model predictions shown in fig 1 we explored whether the discrepancy might be attributable to fine lmb or lapo4 s particles that may have passed through the 0 45 µm filters leading to an underestimation of aqueous po4 removal to test this hypothesis we filtered our samples a second time through 0 1 µm filters po4 removal increased slightly to 87 89 ph 8 5 after this additional filtration step fig 3a but remained below the essentially complete removal we had expected based on model predictions shown in fig 1 we then measured the la content of lmb in triplicate and found that the la content was 3 74 0 08 wt which is lower than the value of 4 4 wt that had been reported in prior publications dithmer et al 2016 lürling et al 2014 reitzel et al 2017 the experimentally determined la content of lmb results in 7 5 mg la l 1 rather than the originally expected 8 8 mg l 1 at 200 mg lmb l 1 when the model was corrected to this la concentration it predicted 85 po4 removal in the absence of nom at equilibrium which agreed well with our experimental data fig 3a c for experiments conducted with lmb the difference between experimental results and model predictions increased as solution ph and nom concentration increased fig 3a c model predictions and empirical observations showed the best agreement at ph 6 fig 3a however with 5 6 mg c l 1 of lha the model predicted po4 removals of 66 at ph 7 and 45 at ph 8 5 which were systematically lower than experimentally determined removals 81 84 at ph 7 and 76 81 at ph 8 5 fig 3b c when the lha concentration was increased to 28 mg c l 1 the discrepancy between model predictions and experimentally determined values became more pronounced red and blue boxes fig 3b c predicted po4 removal was 6 at ph 7 and 0 at ph 8 5 while experimentally determined removals were 66 72 at ph 7 and 74 77 at ph 8 5 highlighted by red and blue arrows fig 3b c experimental results for the other three nom standards esha srfa snom fig s3a c were also compared with model predictions under the same corresponding conditions i e solution ph ha fa ratio and concentration of nom the results were similar to those obtained with lha in that in the absence of nom the empirical po4 removal was 89 96 which was greater than the model prediction of 85 fig s3 in the presence of nom the empirical po4 removal was also greater than the model prediction at the highest concentration of all three nom types predicted po4 removal was essentially zero at ph 8 5 and all la was predicted to be complexed by nom either ha or fa fig 1 however significant po4 removal by lmb 52 83 was observed during the experiments figs s2 s3 3 4 po4 removal by dissolved la3 in the presence of nom to understand the role of bentonite in po4 removal by lmb additional batch experiments were performed in which la3 was added as a soluble lacl3 salt instead of lmb to eliminate the bentonite phase model results were again compared with experimental results fig 3d f in the absence of lha po4 removal by lacl3 was 99 close to the predicted value 100 this result was expected because la and po4 were dosed at a molar ratio of la p 1 1 in the presence of lha 5 6 mg c l 1 at ph 6 the empirical po4 removal was similar to the model prediction fig 3d at ph 7 sequential filtration resulted in a difference in percentage of po4 removed the empirical po4 removal after 0 45 µm filtration 56 was lower than that predicted by the model 78 whereas the removal after 0 1 µm filtration 89 was higher than that predicted by the model fig 3e at ph 8 5 the empirical po4 removal was 89 which was greater than the model prediction 53 at the highest lha concentration 28 mg c l 1 empirically determined po4 removals by la3 decreased from 38 at ph 6 to 6 at ph 8 5 and results at ph 7 and 8 5 were more consistent with model predictions compared to those obtained with lmb comparing fig 3a c with d f with 28 mg c l 1 of lha po4 removal by la3 was significantly lower than by lmb especially at ph 7 and 8 5 as highlighted by red and blue boxes respectively in fig 3 more specifically lmb removed 59 77 of po4 whereas po4 removal by la3 was 6 17 this discrepancy will be discussed further below 3 5 filterable la release from lmb to assess the effects of ph and nom on la release from lmb we conducted batch experiments with lmb 200 mg l 1 in 1 upw amended with lha 0 5 5 28 mg c l 1 at ph 8 5 and 2 upw amended with po4 2 mg p l 1 and lha 0 5 5 28 mg c l 1 at ph 6 7 and 8 5 in upw at ph 8 5 no nom no po4 the concentration of fla i e total la passing through a 0 45 µm filter was 1 2 1 1 µg l 1 in the presence of 5 5 and 28 mg c l 1 lha the concentrations of fla were 986 125 µg l 1 and 3430 44 µg l 1 respectively 1 fig 4 a the addition of po4 decreased the concentration of fla in solutions amended with lha especially at the highest lha dose at which the fla concentration decreased to about one third 1180 µg l 1 of that observed in the absence of po4 figs 4b and s4 to understand the effect of solution ph experiments were conducted at the same lha concentrations with ph controlled at 6 7 and 8 5 fig 4b d similar to fig 4a the amount of la that was released from the lmb matrix at the three ph values increased with increasing lha concentration at 5 5 mg c l 1 of lha the concentration of fla increased with increasing ph while at 28 mg c l 1 of lha the concentration of fla increased with decreasing ph fig s4 la release experiments were also carried out with esha srfa and snom at a ph of 8 5 fig s5 similar to lha the other three nom standards caused enhanced la release as determined by fla from lmb and la release increased as the concentration of nom increased fig s5 in contrast to lha fla gradually increased over time in the presence of esha and snom fig s5 suggesting the release of la or the complexation reaction with nom is a dynamic process further inspection of figs 4 and s5 revealed that concentrations of fla in the presence of different nom standards i e lha esha srfa and snom at apparent equilibrium were different p 0 001 as shown in figs 4 and s5 the amount of fla released from the lmb matrix depended on the type i e fa ha ratio and concentration of nom sequential filtration through filters with 0 45 and 0 1 µm pore sizes confirmed that the concentration of fla decreased as the pore size of the filter membrane decreased fig s4 which was consistent with the po4 removal experiments fig 3 the presence of fla that passes through a 0 45 µm but not a 0 1 µm filter suggests the presence of colloidal particles containing la in the form of lapo4 la nom and or lmb additionally there may also be particulate forms containing la that are larger than 0 45 µm including la nom particles and thus the discrepancy between modeled la and fla shown in fig s4 is not unexpected experimental results obtained with lmb are consistent with geochemical model results in that the model predicted enhanced formation of la nom complexes with increasing nom concentrations figs s4 and s6 moreover model predictions show that the concentrations of aq la defined here as the sum concentration of la3 laoh2 aq and other inorganic complexes were 10 15 10 7 mg l 1 and concentrations decreased with increasing concentration of nom such decreases in aq la were accompanied by decreases in lapo4 and increases in la nom concentration until all la bonded with nom fig s6 4 discussion 4 1 ph dependent effect of nom on po4 sequestration both modeling and experimental results indicate thatpo4 removal decreased in the presence of nom these findings are consistent with previous studies in which humic substances or dissolved organic carbon adversely affected po4 removal after 400 days dithmer et al 2016 and 42 days lürling et al 2014 moreover the magnitude of the decrease was dependent on the concentration and type of nom and the solution ph figs 1 3 s2 and s3 nom contains both relatively strong acidic pka of 3 3 4 0 and weak acidic groups pka 6 as well as a few bidentate sites as major ligands sonke 2006 tipping and hurley 1992 that can compete with po4 for la fig 5 a binding of ions by humic substances such as complexation between nom and la can be described as a metal proton exchange reaction l a 3 nom h la nom h where ph plays an important role tipping et al 2011 tipping and tipping 2002 our findings with lacl3 fig 3d f support the ph dependent effect of nom on po4 binding to la which was least pronounced at ph 6 and most pronounced at ph 8 5 at higher ph weaker acidic groups of nom become deprotonated increasing their ability to bind more la and therefore resulting in more pronounced interference of nom on po4 removal as solution ph increases fig 5b per figs 1 3 s2 and s3 the effects of ha and fa on po4 removal by lmb were not identical p 0 001 and varied with ph p 0 001 which can be attributed to differences in the abundance of mono and bi dentate binding sites intrinsic proton dissociation constant and electrostatic parameters sonke 2006 tipping 1998 it is worth again noting the possible presence of nom la po4 depending on the size of these complexes e g their ability to pass through a 0 45 or 0 1 µm filter the presence of colloid may result in an increase or decrease in po4 concentration in the filterable fraction affecting estimates or removal efficiency given the underprediction of fla as compared to modeled la nom complexes it is reasonable to think that any ternary nom la po4 complexes may contribute to reduced po4 removal efficiency compared to the model however the expected impact of ternary complexes does not explain the difference between the po4 removal efficiency of lacl3 and lmb 4 2 effect of bentonite clay to understand the role of bentonite po4 removal experiments were conducted with la3 and lmb a comparison of lmb i e la3 incorporated in bentonite matrix and la3 i e with the soluble salt lacl3 as a la source demonstrates that greater po4 removal occurred at the highest evaluated nom concentration when bentonite was present as a carrier material the higher removal percentages that were obtained with lmb imply that bentonite reduces la nom interactions while allowing po4 sequestration by la this enhanced efficiency may be explained in terms of the sorption reactivity of the bentonite clay itself although po4 may adsorb to clay minerals bentonite type clays have a low affinity for po4 at ph 8 suggesting direct adsorption to the surface is not the dominant mechanism for enhanced po4 removal by lmb as compared to lacl3 this low adsorption affinity can be rationalized by noting the overall negative charge pzc 3 2 sperry and peirce 1999 of montmorillonite the dominant mineral in bentonite and hence repulsive electrostatic interactions with hpo4 2 however bentonite may also adsorb nom potentially reducing its ability to compete with po4 for la as demonstrated in li et al 2020 nom can be adsorbed by lmb in the presence of po4 in addition chen et al 2017 noted significant adsorption maximum sorbed concentration 6 7 mg c m 2 of a soil humic acid on montmorillonite even at ph 8 which was attributed to ligand exchange and hydrophobic interactions based on the sorption capacity of montmorillonite and assuming a lmb surface area of 29 m2 g 1 baninaam et al 2020 the maximum mass of nom that may be sorbed by bentonite in our system can be estimated as 9 7 mg c which exceed the maximum mass of carbon in even our highest concentrations experiments 7 mg c the sorption of nom by bentonite may thus reduce the effective concentration of nom in solution reducing its ability to compete with po4 for la 4 3 nom influence on la release soluble la released from lmb into aquatic environments is undesirable and may potentially lead to adverse ecological impacts copetti et al 2015 gonzalez et al 2014 published studies have reported that ecotoxicological effects are not expected below a predicted no effect concentration pnec of 4 µg l 1 herrmann et al 2016 further in the netherlands la is subjected to a maximum permissible concentration mpc legislation that is applied to the water column and sediments van oosterhout et al 2020 the netherlands is the only country that has la standards for water and sediment sneller et al 2000 and the maximum permissible fla concentration is 10 1 μg l 1 in surface waters crommentuijn et al 2000 however this mpc was derived from the no observed effect concentration noec determined in a 21 day daphnia reproduction test and divided by 10 van oosterhout et al 2020 the results from our study showed that in upw fla in equilibrium with 200 mg l 1 of lmb 1 2 1 1 µg l 1 fig 4a was below the safety threshold i e pnec of 4 µg l 1 as well as regulatory standards i e 10 1 μg l 1 in addition our results of la release are in agreement with tang and johannesson 2010 who studied la release from sediment in the absence of strong la complexing ligands in solution the amount of la released from the sediment is small tang and johannesson 2010 however la releasing was much more pronounced in the presence of strong complexing ligands tang and johannesson 2010 consistent with our findings for nom here our experimental observations support the hypothesis that nom can influence the concentration of fla in the water column fig 4 this agrees with previous studies that have shown that 1 nom i e fa and ha strongly binds la and la nom complexes dominate la speciation in surface waters within the ph range of 5 4 7 9 tang and johannesson 2003 and estuarine waters moermond et al 2001 and 2 ha can dissolve la in the lmb by complexation as illustrated in fig 5d lürling et al 2014 reitzel et al 2017 a previous study that used sequential filtration demonstrated that la could bind to negatively charged regions of ha leading to the formation of colloidal la ha complexes reitzel et al 2017 the authors observed that up to 14 of fla was released from lmb in soft water lakes with high ha concentration with 400 mg l 1 of lmb and 22 mg c l 1 reitzel et al 2017 their findings are comparable with ours wherein 4 10 of la was released at 5 5 mg c l 1 of lha and 13 30 of la was released at 28 mg c l 1 of lha with 200 mg l 1 of lmb in our study further we found the presence of po4 limited fla concentrations even in the presence of nom we therefore conclude that the concentration of fla is strongly dependent on the concentrations of nom and po4 consistent with previous investigations our experiments show that concentrations of fla are dependent on the size of pores used during sample filtration fla concentrations declined as the pore diameters decreased fig s4 reitzel et al 2017 detectable fla remained in the aqueous phase after filtration through both 0 45 and 0 1 μm membrane filters reitzel et al 2017 demonstrated that fla concentrations in some samples were as high as 2 mg l 1 and there was detectable fla even after 30 min of ultracentrifuge 62 000 g collectively these results indicate that careful attention to separation methodologies is critical for determining accurate concentrations of fla one interesting point of discussion is the speciation of fla it is an important question for lake managers whether the fla should be considered as truly dissolved la or rather as small nontoxic colloids containing la among all possible la species ionic la3 has the greatest potential to cause ecotoxicological impacts across various studies copetti et al 2015 das et al 1988 gonzalez et al 2014 herrmann et al 2016 on the contrary la complexation with nom will reduce the bioavailability of la and therefore its associated ecotoxicity gonzalez et al 2014 herrmann et al 2016 based on our model results the concentration of ionic la3 is 10 7 mg l 1 at all conditions fig s6 with 8 8 mg la l 1 2 mg p l 1 ph 6 7 8 5 and nom concentration 0 30 mg c l 1 in cases where la is limited and strong ligands nom and po4 are present ionic la3 will likely be depleted and not contribute substantially to fla in addition as reported by previous studies fla concentrations in filtered samples depend on pore size of the filter suggesting that various colloidal forms of la are present lürling et al 2014 reitzel et al 2017 van oosterhout et al 2020 moreover in hard water lakes and in eutrophic waters with elevated ph reitzel et al 2017 found from sequential filtration and ultracentrifugation that virtually all fla will be colloidal reitzel et al 2017 this speciation was attributed to la precipitates with bi carbonate at higher alkalinity and insoluble la hydroxide forms at elevated ph in contrast in soft water lakes with high nom content most of the fla was on a dissolved form and likely associated with nom reitzel et al 2017 generally how much truly dissolved la3 will be present in fla depends on water chemistry 5 conclusions in this study we evaluated the impacts of natural organic matter nom on po4 binding to lanthanum modified bentonite lmb and la release from the lmb matrix as a function of solution ph by using chemical equilibrium modeling and controlled laboratory batch kinetic experiments we found that po4 removal decreased in the presence of nom and the magnitude of the decrease was dependent on the concentration of nom type of nom and ph the bentonite matrix may adsorb nom and reduce la nom interactions contributing to lmb efficacy for po4 removal in neutral to alkaline waters with high nom in the presence of 28 mg c l 1 lmb removed 59 74 po4 at conditions at which free la3 was not able to achieve meaningful po4 removal the presence of nom also enhanced the release of la from the lmb matrix although po4 can limit the amount of fla in the water overall these findings provide an important basis for the use of lmb to manage phosphorous and eutrophication problems in lakes and other water bodies future research efforts should focus on evaluating the effectiveness of lmb as an effective p removal strategy in parallel with efforts to evaluate its broader environmental and societal impacts particularly for in situ applications among other research areas more work is needed to better understand la release from lmb including underlying mechanisms for release in a range of environmental contexts including in waters with high nom and low phosphate concentrations declaration of

16808,despite massive financial investment in mitigation eutrophication remains a major water quality problem and management priority eutrophication science well established for lakes is not as well developed for rivers and scientific understanding of how rivers respond to eutrophication management is far more limited long term data are required to evaluate progress but such datasets are relatively rare for rivers we analyzed 23 years of water quality data for the charles river a major urban river system in the northeastern u s a to examine nutrient and phytoplankton biomass chl a responses to decades of phosphorus p management using the more novel and robust approach of quantile regression we identified statistically and ecologically significant declines in both total phosphorus tp and chl a over time but only for middle percentiles statistically high concentrations of tp and chl a persist the segments of the data of greatest concern to managers and the public and yet this critical result is concealed by statistical tests often employed in eutrophication studies that only evaluate mean changes tp temperature precipitation and river segment jointly explain the most chl a variation observed at the decadal scale spatial variation is also considerable despite a significant decline in tp the impounded lower river exhibits no long term trend in chl a and continues to experience annual blooms of harmful cyanobacteria a lagging response comparable to that of a recovering eutrophic lake despite long term successes in reducing p chl a and cyanobacteria in the charles river system we did not detect any significant long term change in the attainment of statutory compliance illustrating the protracted and complex nature of the river s response our analysis demonstrates the need for high frequency long term water quality data to evaluate the progress of eutrophication management in urban rivers and the utility of quantile regression for detecting critical trends in the occurrence of statistically low frequency but ecologically high impact events including blooms of harmful cyanobacteria graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords river eutrophication phytoplankton biomass cyanobacteria long term data quantile regression 1 introduction the pursuit of improved water quality has been a multibillion dollar endeavor in the united states since the establishment of the environmental protection agency epa in 1970 managing surface waters so that they attain their mandated water quality targets and designated uses under the clean water act cwa requires long term monitoring of water quality parameters and analysis of changes in these parameters over time despite massive abatement programs eutrophication the stimulation of high rates of primary production and nuisance overgrowth of phytoplankton including harmful algal blooms habs dominated by potentially toxic cyanobacteria downing et al 2001 heisler et al 2008 remains one of the most pervasive environmental problems affecting water quality in the united states and elsewhere dodds et al 2009 chislock et al 2013 habs cause environmental damage and threaten the health of humans and wildlife by producing toxins depleting dissolved oxygen and fouling the water huisman et al 2005 loftin et al 2016 collectively impeding multiple designated uses under the cwa as long term monitoring data have begun to accumulate recent water quality trends in response to state and federal management efforts have been mixed to favorable in the u s a shoda et al 2019 topp et al 2020 continued progress may be complicated however by other anthropogenic impacts particularly climate change which is expected to promote cyanobacteria habs paerl and huisman 2008 elliott 2012 counter to abatement efforts global increases in phytoplankton and cyanobacteria blooms have recently been reported paerl and paul 2012 ho et al 2019 given the scale of the problem it is not surprising that eutrophication of inland waters and subsequent long term responses to remediation efforts have been well studied albeit in the traditional context of lakes e g schindler 1977 edmondson and lehman 1981 bertram 1993 effler and o donnell 2010 as a result of the historical emphasis on lakes comparable long term analyses of nutrient trends in eutrophied river ecosystems are much fewer in number but see jones 2000 minaudo et al 2015 romero et al 2016 where the study of eutrophication has lagged and the concept is not as well formalized hilton et al 2006 wurtsbaugh et al 2019 this is despite massive impacts of urbanization on river ecosystems globally mcgrane 2016 grill et al 2019 given their critical role in the hydrological and ecological connectivity of surface waters analyses of eutrophication responses by rivers are still desperately needed dodds and smith 2016 relative to lakes river ecosystems are spatially and temporally dynamic with complex interacting factors driving water quality changes basu and pick 1995 bowes et al 2016 hutchins and hitt 2019 water temperature water residence time discharge transparency light and ph have all been found to be correlated with temperate river phytoplankton biomass in previous studies in addition to nutrients basu and pick 1996 balbi 2000 bukaveckas et al 2011 bowes et al 2016 variation in run off and erosion patterns as well as anthropogenic land use changes in the watershed can further influence these processes bennett et al 2001 walsh et al 2005 in freshwater ecosystems phosphorus p is often identified as the limiting nutrient and principal driver of eutrophication as a result management practices have focused on controlling p loading schindler 1974 massdep 2007 2011 schindler et al 2016 anthropogenic p inputs to upland soils have increased since industrialization which increases the concentration of p in runoff to surface waters carpenter 2008 despite the traditional scientific and policy focus the relative role of p and other factors in driving eutrophication remains debated including for rivers dodds and smith 2016 paerl et al 2016 schindler et al 2016 for example meta analyses have identified synergistic effects of p and nitrogen n indicating that many freshwater ecosystems and their phytoplankton in particular may be co limited elser et al 2007 within stream and river systems themselves where benthic production and heterotrophy often dominate carbon fluxes in contrast to deep stratified lakes responses are likewise observed to enrichment with both n and p dodds and smith 2016 although nutrients are not the only potentially limiting factors for example in the absence of light limitation phytoplankton of large turbid rivers in the ohio river network of the east central united states have been shown to be either p limited or n p co limited koch et al 2004 while managing eutrophication via p control is relatively tractable from a policy standpoint attempting to predict phytoplankton biomass using p alone may result in sizable residual error especially within a single ecosystem dillon and rigler 1974 prediction is made more difficult by standard analyses like simple linear regression which implicitly assume a single process controls biomass variations multiple processes including short term hydrological events precipitation and drought slowly increasing average temperature and long term land use changes force multiple time scales of change in n and p loading paerl et al 2018 and hence phytoplankton biomass chlorophyll a chl a the light harvesting pigment contained in phytoplankton cells is routinely used as a reliable measurement of lake and river phytoplankton biomass dillon and rigler 1974 kalff 2002 including by state and federal agencies in water quality monitoring programs massdep 2007 2011 since chl a concentration in the water column typically responds predictably to changes in p loading and it can be measured rapidly and inexpensively it is also routinely used by managers to quantify eutrophication status although they do not provide specific information on phytoplankton community composition long term chl a data are used to quantify changes in total phytoplankton biomass over time and therefore to assess the effectiveness of policies and management efforts designed to mitigate eutrophication edmondson and lehman 1981 james et al 1994 effler et al 2008 romero et al 2016 the episodic nature of individual phytoplankton blooms however means that even favorable long term trends in chl a can still be punctuated and potentially obscured by infrequent but extreme phytoplankton bloom events that have disproportionately large socio ecological impact therefore it is important to not only quantify how ecosystems are changing on average over the long term in response to eutrophication management but also to evaluate changes in the most statistically extreme percentiles of the data our objectives are to analyze long term 23 years changes in median and extreme concentrations of p and chl a in the charles river a major urban suburban river in the northeastern united states historically characterized by poor water quality to determine whether the river system has been responding to decades of phosphorus control we employ a more novel and powerful statistical analysis quantile regression qr that has only recently been used in the study of lake eutrophication xu et al 2015 vinçon leite and casenave 2019 to identify important signals and water quality trends that have practical importance for managers and for the scientific understanding of how urban rivers respond to long term eutrophication management 2 materials and methods 2 1 study system the charles river fig 1 is a 4th order low gradient system that flows approximately 130 km from hopkinton ma to boston ma u s a draining an area of 778 km2 that encompasses 35 municipalities populated by 900 000 people a variety of large public open spaces along the riverfront including the famed esplanade comprise a major part of the cultural economic and recreational center of the city of boston the heavily urbanized watershed characterized by a high percentage of impervious surfaces and a large network of drainage pipes and canals contributes a substantial contaminant load to the river heavy precipitation events have caused numerous combined sewer overflows csos which are a major source of p to the river breault et al 2002 coughlin 2005 furthermore a series of constructed dams and locks in the lower charles just above the mouth at boston harbor effectively impound the river creating a hydrologically distinct segment in the lower watershed known as the basin fig 1 here hydraulic flushing is extremely limited and tidal exchange with the adjacent harbor is eliminated resulting in an artificially lentic environment that is particularly susceptible to contaminant accumulation and hypoxia coughlin 2005 which tend to exacerbate eutrophication and facilitate summer blooms of harmful cyanobacteria water quality of the charles river deteriorated to the point that swimming was banned in the 1950s as a result of these

response variable y at multiple values of predictor variables x to fit a function f such that y f x cade and noon 2003 olsr has a number of shortcomings when applied to environmental data shortcomings arising from both violations of assumptions inherent to the fitting and limitations of the produced model the original name for olsr was regression to the mean senn 2011 and the mathematics behind olsr assumes that the y values are normally distributed around a mean y at each value of x the output of olsr the best fit line is an estimate of those mean y at each x error envelopes around the regression line while essential simply provide some measure of uncertainty in the mean y as a function of x data collected from environmental and ecological studies is often non normal stern and coe

lead to poor results warton and hui 2011 even if the data are successfully transformed olsr extracts a single aspect of the distribution of y the mean understanding the full set of forces driving the variation of y is aided by understanding other parts of the distribution of the response variable besides the mean cade and noon 2003 a more robust approach is to model y on non parametric measures such as quantiles of x which allows robust estimation of changes at the upper and lower limits of a distribution quantile regression qr has a long history in ecological studies reviewed in cade and noon 2003 and is helpful in disentangling multiple often hidden processes limiting or contributing to measured parameters we used qr as implemented in r by koenker 2020 to estimate quantiles of chl a and nutrient data as linear functions of predictor variables an advantage to this procedure is the ability to estimate any quantile allowing careful examination of the tails of the data for example below we examine the behavior over time of the median concentration of chl a or the 50th percentile of the data quantile regression is flexible enough to allow examination of the highest quantiles 85th percentiles and greater separately from others providing insights into the potentially different forces driving changes in a river s water quality we use the 99 5 confidence intervals as uncertainties in our quoted values to model drivers of long term variation in chl a we extended the above qr approach to allow for multiple predictor variables liu and wu 2009 using aicc to select the best fitting model from a set of a priori candidate models finally we used logit regression to assess whether there has been a change over time in the rate of attainment of statutory compliance for

75 and this likelihood has not significantly changed over time logit regression p 0 2 the likelihood of the basin attaining this same target in any given year increased from 0 to about 40 starting after 2009 and the trend is suggestive of an increase in compliance rate over time logit regression p 0 05 if the basin were to achieve compliance during any one of the next two years the trend will be statistically significant whereas achieving compliance for the next two years will not affect the trend of the upper river mean orthophosphate po4 3 equation 7 olsr r2 0 024 p 0 001 and ammonium

the rate of increase in the upper river is more than double that of the basin using multiple quantile regression we explored the underlying drivers of this long term variation in charles river chl a based on aicc we identified the best fitting final model from among a pool of a priori candidate models all assessed percentiles 25th 50th 75th and 95th of chl a had roughly the same ordering of relative model quality with models that excluded tp strongly contra indicated and more extreme percentiles requiring more model terms to achieve similar relative goodness of fit table 3 for example the 25th percentile was explained by a model of two terms at a aicc of 71 whereas comparable values of aicc for the 50th percentile required a minimum of three terms and higher percentiles required four terms our final model includes water temperature tp precipitation and river segment of the sample site upper river coded 0 vs the basin coded 1 as predictors table 3 the effects of water

significant r 0 47 p 0 04 4 discussion urbanization impacts on river ecosystems world wide are large and extensive globally up to 63 of rivers are no longer free flowing due to fragmentation by dams and loss of source sea connectivity grill et al 2019 urban infrastructure has altered natural flow regimes and increased contaminant loading resulting in a degradation of water quality that has in turn increased attention to rehabilitation mcgrane 2016 the charles river system is a microcosm of this global trend and provides a unique opportunity to understand the long term drivers of urban river eutrophication and subsequent whole ecosystem responses to mitigation our analysis of long term charles river water quality data indicates that the system is responding favorably albeit slowly to phosphorus management efforts fig 2 we report that tp a routinely used surrogate for trophic state and potential primary productivity has declined river wide by 34 µg l over 23 years although tp concentrations river wide remain near or above the mesotrophic eutrophic boundary the observed net change in tp is roughly equal to the difference between an oligotrophic and eutrophic system using traditional lake criteria and more recently developed criteria for streams carlson and simpson 1996 dodds et al 1998 importantly from a eutrophication mitigation standpoint the fraction of the tp that is most bioavailable to producers orthophosphate po4 3 has also significantly declined on average accordingly average phytoplankton chl a declined by 5 µg l over 23 years although significant changes are restricted to sites upstream of the basin fig 2 by these metrics p loading to the river and the total standing crop of phytoplankton have generally been reduced consistent with federally mandated phosphorus mitigation efforts under the cwa and more specifically the clean charles river initiative implemented in the late 1990s coughlin 2005 weiskel et al 2005 a seasonal mean target of 10 µg l chl a was set river wide for compliance under the cwa and this target continues to be achieved about 75 of the time in the upper river and has more recently been attained in the basin fig 4 using the canonical definitions of statistical significance there has been no change in statutory seasonal chl a compliance rates although the evidence suggests a positive trend in the basin while phytoplankton biomass was already lower and closer to compliance targets in the upper river the upper river is roughly as likely to attain compliance in a given year as it was 23 years ago from a strict statistical sense if at least one of the next two years of seasonal averages meets the requirement in the basin the slope in our logit regression would be significant and positive indicating increased compliance rates in the basin over time we stress that this measure is somewhat artificial depending upon somewhat arbitrary measures of statistical significance p 0 05 and compliance 10 μg l but it is of course upon these arbitrary standards that policy is built phytoplankton biomass in the charles river and especially the basin is stimulated by increases in tp but not tn with the highest chl a observations typically occurring at tn tp 29 by mass fig 5 given that the observed tn tp ratio is generally 7 1 by mass the redfield ratio the charles river phytoplankton community is more likely to be p limited on average redfield 1958 kalff 2002 dodds and smith 2016 and the reduction in tp over time has accordingly caused the tn tp ratio to increase significantly river wide trending further toward p limitation although it is important to note that limitation status may vary seasonally ammonium nh4 a highly bioavailable form of n has significantly declined on average along with p suggesting the same management strategies to control p in the charles river have also been effective at reducing nh4 however there has been no long term effect of these efforts on tn and nitrate nitrite concentrations in the charles river indeed we actually detected a mild negative influence of tn on chl a in the basin continued management efforts to reduce p loading may thus result in further concomitant reductions in river phytoplankton biomass jones and lee 1986 schindler et al 2016 although reducing p concentrations in rivers has not always resulted in timely attainment of expected water quality targets due to long time lags nonlinear responses and the decoupling of phytoplankton biomass from p jarvie et al 2013 efforts to target and successfully eliminate discrete point sources of p to the river system may also increase the importance of more diffuse non point sources to the annual p loading budget which may differ in chemical composition bioavailability and timing of delivery withers and jarvie 2008 of particular concern is the continued presence of potentially harmful bloom forming cyanobacteria in the basin fig 2 summer fall phytoplankton blooms in the basin tend to be dominated by n fixing cyanobacteria including aphanizomenon and anabaena crwa unpubl that may have competitive advantage at the low tn tp ratios 29 1 by mass characteristic of the basin fig 5 and culturally eutrophic lakes given their ability to utilize compensatory atmospheric n2 schindler 1977 smith 1983 concern that any nutrient abatement effort that shifts the stoichiometry to n limitation will promote n fixing cyanobacteria has been a leading argument for p only management of eutrophication in inland waters schindler et al 2016 although low n p ratios alone and long term reductions in n loading have not generally been met by compensatory increases in n fixing cyanobacteria scott and mccarthy 2010 shatwell and köhler 2019 using a multiple qr approach and aicc we identified tp water temperature precipitation and river segment upper river vs the basin as the best predictors of chl a variation at the quarterly sampling frequency and decadal extent of the dataset river segment captures critical spatial variation in phytoplankton dynamics in the charles river with sites within the basin having significantly higher phytoplankton biomass than sites in the upper river fig 3 given the large and ecologically important spatial variation we observed in the responses of the upper river versus the basin fig 2 3 4 the data continue to support management of the upper river and basin as distinct hydrologic entities with unique underlying drivers consistent with similar studies we found that water temperature and tp are significant positive forcings on river chl a basu and pick 1995 balbi 2000 bukaveckas et al 2011 the growth rate of most north temperate eukaryotic phytoplankton taxa is an increasing function of temperature up to an optimum of 15 25 c with prokaryotic bloom forming cyanobacteria generally having higher optimal growth temperatures of 25 32 c paerl 2018 although water column tp includes the organic p contained in phytoplankton cells and has therefore been criticized for its lack of statistical independence as a predictor of phytoplankton biomass lewis and wurtsbaugh 2008 tp concentration is more reliable over the long term than bioavailable inorganic nutrients e g po4 3 nh4 and no3 for predicting phytoplankton biomass in p limited systems kalff 2002 inorganic nutrients were not significant predictors of charles river chl a at this sampling frequency which may reflect their rapid turnover rates and generally high short term variability that would not be captured by this dataset we found that precipitation is a better predictor of long term chl a dynamics in the charles river than discharge and that it is a negative forcing precipitation likely integrates the effects of discharge on primary productivity with those of nutrient loading via urban runoff and combined sewer overflows historically important sources of p to the charles river during periods of intense rainfall possibly explaining its predictive superiority over discharge alone further the negative forcing of precipitation on chl a implies a dominant flushing effect of precipitation on phytoplankton biomass through increased river discharge bukaveckas et al 2011 jeong et al 2011 particularly in the upper river temperate river phytoplankton are more likely to be limited by discharge than nutrients when the water residence time wrt is 3 days basu and pick 1996 which occurs in the free flowing reaches massdep 2011 whereas median wrt in the basin is 21 days with an inter quartile range of 15 to 35 days massdep 2007 approximately 70 of the annual loads of both n and p to the basin are delivered during dry weather conditions breault et al 2002 and increased precipitation may also dilute nutrient concentrations when point sources dominate nutrient loading balbi 2000 ultimately nutrients and phytoplankton biomass that are flushed downstream to the more lentic impounded basin can accumulate which almost certainly explains some of the observed spatial variation in the long term responses of chl a see below qr has only recently been employed in the study of lake eutrophication management where it has been found to improve eutrophication modeling by reducing the uncertainty in critical nutrient limitation thresholds and to identify statistically robust lake specific management strategies xu et al 2015 vinçon leite and casenave 2019 to our knowledge ours is among the first applications of qr in the long term study of river eutrophication an approach that can help isolate specific river sites requiring management attention focus future monitoring efforts and also critically provides information about which segments of the data are changing or not by examining specific percentiles of practical use and ecological significance gao et al 2020 for example we detected through qr that both the highest and lowest percentiles i e below the 1st and above the 84th 95th of tp and chl a are unchanging the lack of change in tp and chl a at statistically extreme percentiles may be due in part to sample size limitations as by definition statistically extreme percentiles contain relatively few observations this statistical artifact may be especially pronounced at the lowest percentiles e g the 1st where the data are also constrained against the floor of 0 and so we would expect lower percentiles to decline slower over time than higher percentiles indeed higher percentiles of chl a have consistently steeper negative slopes than lower percentiles up to the 94th percentile but this pattern reverses for the 95th and higher percentiles which show no significant slope and thus no change in the highest concentrations of chl a during the entire span of record this latter observation instead reflects a persistence of large episodic and generally localized summer fall phytoplankton bloom events particularly in the basin the ability to identify and isolate these patterns statistically at scientifically meaningful user defined percentiles is the major benefit to using qr over traditional data averaging and olsr methods xu et al 2015 gao et al 2020 in the case of the charles river olsr successfully identifies overall significant declines on average but conceals the lack of trends in the highest percentiles the ones of greatest management and public health concern that are only revealed by qr fig 2 since these highest observations of chl a are positively correlated with the biomass of potentially harmful cyanobacteria in the basin fig 7 understanding the short term drivers of these problematic events at the site specific scale may be critical for further controlling their occurrence ideally future management efforts would be directed at mitigating these persistent ecologically high impact statistically low frequency events management targets and water quality assessments based on ecologically defined percentiles may in fact be more meaningful than those based on average conditions since a decrease in the highest percentiles of a monitored impairment like cyanobacteria biomass is arguably the most direct evidence for improvement despite statistically significant decreases in water column tp and phycocyanin cyanobacteria the chl a response in the basin remains stalled as is commonly observed during the recovery of culturally eutrophic shallow lakes due to hysteresis scheffer et al 1993 which can take years to decades to overcome søndergaard et al 2003 effler and o donnell 2010 this lagging response fig 2 4 is also not surprising given the hydrology of the charles river system the basin constitutes the lowest point in a heavily urbanized watershed fig 1 with 81 of the annual p and n loads originating from upstream breault et al 2002 however the elimination of hydraulic and tidal flushing in this segment through the impounding of the river mouth creates an artificially lentic environment that promotes the sequestration of nutrients in the river sediments this may act as a positive feedback on eutrophication through the internal loading of bioavailable po4 3 during periods when the sediments are overlaid by anoxic water søndergaard et al 2003 james 2017 density stratification of the water column in the lower basin occurs with vertical gradients in both temperature and salinity due to saltwater intrusion from boston harbor promoting anoxia in the bottom waters coughlin 2005 given that the basin is relatively shallow z 4 2 m zmax 11 m c zimba crab mit sea grant pers comm and warm july august temperature at 1 m

cyanobacteria smith et al 1987 watson et al 1997 downing et al 2001 recovery of the basin itself is therefore likely to continue to follow the trajectory observed in most shallow eutrophic lakes hilton et al 2006 the effects of ongoing climate change including gradual warming and changes in precipitation patterns may further influence the basin s rate of recovery withers and jarvie 2008 downscaled temperature and precipitation projections pierce et al 2014 from coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 models through 2097 are available for the charles river basin 2 2 https resilientma org datagrapher c temp basin maxt ann charles by the end of the model period 2080 to 2097 projected annual precipitation rises by roughly 10 cm or 8 above the 1971 2000 median but due to strong seasonal effects 60 to 80 of this increase falls in winter and spring while summer precipitation remains flat projected annual maximum air temperatures increase by nearly 4 c over the same period with higher increases in summer and fall and lower increases in spring and winter while the uncertainties in these projections are admittedly large the seasonal effects are consistent and expected long term increases in winter and spring precipitation coupled with comparatively drier summers will based on the models we developed here aggravate phytoplankton growth in the charles river summer temperature increases are particularly worrisome and will only exacerbate the underlying causes of poor water quality as days per summer with maximum air temperatures higher than 32 2 c and 35 c 90 f and 95 f increase by roughly 30 and 15 d respectively by the 2080 2097 period this increase an entire additional month of days with temperatures 32 c in a three month period will increase stratification stability and promote bottom anoxia in the basin and thus favor an increased frequency and severity of summer fall habs paerl and huisman 2008 elliott 2012 kosten et al 2012 given the weak secular improvement in seasonal chl a compliance see above it is currently unclear which slow process policy driven improvement in hab forcing or anthropogenic climate change will dominate the future of the charles river the persistent statistically high observations of both tp and phytoplankton biomass particularly in the basin are detectable even at the quarterly sampling scale of this dataset while datasets like the one we analyzed are very useful for assessing overall net responses to eutrophication mitigation and the underlying drivers at the seasonal and decadal scales minaudo et al 2015 dodds and smith 2016 existing publicly available data for the charles river are of insufficient frequency to model and predict individual phytoplankton bloom events which are ultimately the episodes that have the greatest social and economic impacts cyanobacteria blooms in particular can be highly stochastic events that culminate from a complex interaction of many internal physical chemical and biological factors and external climatic factors these signals can be transient hours days and highly dynamic such as nutrient releases from the sediments rapid nutrient turnover during periods of bloom growth and senescence and interactions between temperature and wind affecting water column stability soranno 1997 jacoby et al 2000 huber et al 2012 thus detecting long term responses to eutrophication remediation not only requires sufficient data across years to detect net changes but also sufficient data within years particularly during the growing season to assess whether the frequency and intensity of individual bloom events is also changing this requirement for higher frequency data is particularly critical for understanding the eutrophication recovery of flowing systems such as river networks which are inherently spatially and temporally dynamic balbi 2000 minaudo et al 2015 bowes et al 2016 cultural eutrophication of lakes and their long term responses to remediation efforts has a long and rich history of study in limnology e g schindler 1974 1977 edmondson and lehman 1981 bertram 1993 which has resulted in the establishment of fundamental ecological paradigms successful passage of landmark environmental legislation and the development of best management practices for impaired inland lakes although historically less emphasized by limnologists rivers and streams have long been recognized as catchments conduits and reactors for materials like nutrients hynes 1975 vannote et al 1980 and thus serve critically in the hydrological and ecological connectivity of the terrestrial landscape and downstream waters both fresh and marine wiens 2002 fergus et al 2017 mitigating negative downstream effects of nutrient loading to surface waters therefore requires understanding of eutrophication dynamics of nutrient impaired rivers boesch 2019 and recognizing that the relative importance of different eutrophication drivers is not uniform across aquatic ecosystems hecky and kilham 1988 for example emphasis on p management to control eutrophication in inland waters may overlook the problem of large scale anthropogenic inputs of n and its transport by rivers to coastal marine systems where n limitation is more pervasive and the fact that productivity in many inland waters is frequently co limited by both n and p howarth and marino 2006 elser et al 2007 paerl et al 2018 despite all of this recognition scientific understanding of river eutrophication and the subsequent response to mitigation efforts has substantially lagged behind that of lakes and our study represents a direct response to a recent call for analyses of eutrophication recovery in rivers using existing long term water quality data dodds and smith 2016 there has been laudable success over the long term in reducing tp chl a and cyanobacteria biomass in the charles river system although our analysis also illuminates the protracted lagging nature of the recovery and where responses have thus far fallen short of targets the need for similar analyses of river systems is heightened by ongoing and complex global change which will likely alter the recovery rate and trajectory of these ecosystems and necessitate employing more powerful statistical approaches 5 conclusions by the 1990s charles river water quality was severely degraded a large management initiative to mitigate eutrophication began and after 2 decades of p abatement significant progress has been made when simply considering average changes tp chl a and cyanobacteria biomass have all significantly declined although the success of water quality policies is often determined by attaining some average response target analyses like ordinary least square regression that consider only the average response can conceal critical patterns and signals in the data that are of management concern such as the persistence of statistically high concentrations of tp and chl a despite favorable trends quantile regression revealed that the highest chl a concentrations associated with annual blooms of potentially harmful cyanobacteria have not yet subsided and there has been no detectable improvement to date in the rate of attaining the seasonal chl a target for policy compliance our analysis thus illuminates the protracted lagging response of chl a and cyanobacteria to p abatement in a major urban river system and emphasizes the long term and incremental nature of its recovery we demonstrate the continuing need for long term analyses of river eutrophication and

16808,despite massive financial investment in mitigation eutrophication remains a major water quality problem and management priority eutrophication science well established for lakes is not as well developed for rivers and scientific understanding of how rivers respond to eutrophication management is far more limited long term data are required to evaluate progress but such datasets are relatively rare for rivers we analyzed 23 years of water quality data for the charles river a major urban river system in the northeastern u s a to examine nutrient and phytoplankton biomass chl a responses to decades of phosphorus p management using the more novel and robust approach of quantile regression we identified statistically and ecologically significant declines in both total phosphorus tp and chl a over time but only for middle percentiles statistically high concentrations of tp and chl a persist the segments of the data of greatest concern to managers and the public and yet this critical result is concealed by statistical tests often employed in eutrophication studies that only evaluate mean changes tp temperature precipitation and river segment jointly explain the most chl a variation observed at the decadal scale spatial variation is also considerable despite a significant decline in tp the impounded lower river exhibits no long term trend in chl a and continues to experience annual blooms of harmful cyanobacteria a lagging response comparable to that of a recovering eutrophic lake despite long term successes in reducing p chl a and cyanobacteria in the charles river system we did not detect any significant long term change in the attainment of statutory compliance illustrating the protracted and complex nature of the river s response our

united states since the establishment of the environmental protection agency epa in 1970 managing surface waters so that they attain their mandated water quality targets and designated uses under the

abatement efforts global increases in phytoplankton and cyanobacteria blooms have recently been reported paerl and paul 2012 ho et al 2019 given the scale of the problem it is not surprising that eutrophication of inland waters and subsequent long term responses to remediation efforts have been well studied albeit in the traditional context of lakes e g schindler 1977 edmondson and lehman 1981 bertram 1993 effler and o donnell 2010 as a result of the historical emphasis on lakes comparable long term analyses of nutrient trends in eutrophied river ecosystems are much fewer in number but see jones 2000 minaudo et al 2015 romero et al 2016 where the study of eutrophication has lagged and the concept is not as well formalized hilton et al 2006 wurtsbaugh et al 2019 this is despite massive impacts of urbanization on river ecosystems globally mcgrane 2016 grill et al 2019 given their critical role in the hydrological and ecological connectivity of surface waters analyses of eutrophication responses by rivers are still desperately needed dodds and smith 2016 relative to lakes river ecosystems are spatially and temporally dynamic with complex interacting factors driving

temperate river phytoplankton biomass in previous studies in addition to nutrients basu and pick 1996 balbi 2000 bukaveckas et al 2011 bowes et al 2016 variation in run off and erosion patterns as well as anthropogenic land use changes in the watershed can further influence these processes bennett et al 2001 walsh et al 2005 in freshwater ecosystems phosphorus p is often identified as the limiting nutrient and principal driver of eutrophication as a result management practices have focused on controlling p loading schindler 1974 massdep 2007 2011 schindler et al 2016 anthropogenic p inputs to upland soils have increased since industrialization which increases the concentration of p in runoff to surface waters carpenter 2008 despite the traditional scientific and policy focus the relative role of p and other factors in driving eutrophication remains debated including for rivers dodds and smith 2016 paerl et al 2016 schindler et al 2016 for example meta analyses have identified synergistic effects of p and nitrogen n indicating that many freshwater ecosystems and their phytoplankton in particular may be co limited elser et al 2007 within stream and river systems themselves where benthic production and heterotrophy often dominate carbon fluxes in contrast to deep stratified lakes responses are likewise observed to enrichment with both n and p dodds and smith 2016 although nutrients are not the only potentially limiting factors for example in the absence of light limitation phytoplankton of large turbid rivers in the ohio river network of the east central united states have been shown to be either p limited or n p co limited koch et al 2004 while managing eutrophication via p control is relatively tractable from a policy standpoint attempting to predict phytoplankton biomass using p alone may result in sizable residual error especially within a single ecosystem dillon and rigler 1974 prediction is made more difficult by standard analyses like simple linear regression which implicitly assume a single process controls biomass variations multiple processes including short term hydrological events precipitation and drought slowly increasing average temperature and long term land use changes force multiple time scales of change in n and p loading paerl et al 2018 and hence phytoplankton biomass chlorophyll a chl a the light harvesting pigment contained in phytoplankton cells is routinely used as a reliable measurement of lake and river phytoplankton biomass dillon and rigler 1974 kalff 2002 including by state and federal agencies in water quality monitoring programs massdep 2007 2011 since chl a concentration in the water column typically responds predictably to changes in p loading and it can be measured rapidly and inexpensively it is also routinely used by managers to quantify eutrophication status although they do not provide specific information on phytoplankton community composition long term chl a data are used to quantify changes in total phytoplankton biomass over time and therefore to assess the effectiveness of policies and management efforts designed to mitigate eutrophication edmondson and lehman 1981 james et al 1994 effler et al 2008 romero et al 2016 the episodic nature of individual phytoplankton blooms however means that even favorable long term trends in chl a can still be punctuated and potentially obscured by infrequent but extreme phytoplankton bloom events that have disproportionately large socio ecological impact therefore it is important to not only quantify how ecosystems are changing on average over the long term in response to eutrophication management but also to evaluate changes in the most statistically extreme percentiles of the data our objectives are to analyze long term 23 years changes in median and extreme concentrations of p and chl a in the charles river a major urban suburban river in the northeastern united states historically characterized by poor water quality to determine whether the river system has been responding to decades of phosphorus control we employ a more novel and powerful statistical analysis quantile regression qr that has only recently been used in the study of lake eutrophication xu et al 2015 vinçon leite and casenave 2019 to identify important signals and water quality trends that have practical importance for managers and for the scientific understanding of how urban rivers respond to long term eutrophication management 2 materials and methods 2 1 study system the charles river fig 1 is a 4th order low gradient

response variable y at multiple values of predictor variables x to fit a function f such that y f x cade and noon 2003 olsr has a number of shortcomings when applied to environmental data shortcomings arising from both violations of assumptions inherent to the fitting and limitations of the produced model the original name for olsr was regression to the mean senn 2011 and the mathematics behind olsr assumes that the y values are normally distributed around a mean y at each value of x the output of olsr the best fit line is an estimate of those mean y at each x error envelopes around the regression line while essential simply provide some measure of uncertainty in the mean y as a function of x data collected from environmental and ecological studies is often non normal stern and coe 1984 which has led to the cottage industry of transforming data by logs roots and even inverse trigonometric functions tukey 1977 the practice tries to force normality on data that have none and can lead to poor results warton and hui 2011 even if the data are successfully transformed olsr extracts a single aspect of the distribution of y the mean understanding the full set of forces driving the variation of y is aided by understanding other parts of the distribution of the response variable besides the mean cade and noon 2003 a more robust approach is to model y on non parametric measures such as quantiles of x which allows robust estimation of changes at the upper and lower limits of a distribution quantile regression qr has a long history in ecological studies reviewed in cade and noon 2003 and is helpful in disentangling multiple often hidden processes limiting or contributing to measured parameters we used qr as implemented in r by koenker 2020 to estimate quantiles of chl a and nutrient data as linear functions of predictor variables an advantage to this procedure is the ability to estimate any quantile allowing careful examination of the tails of the data for example below we examine the behavior over time of the median concentration of chl a or the 50th percentile of the data quantile regression is flexible enough to allow examination of the highest quantiles 85th percentiles and greater separately from others providing insights into the potentially different forces driving changes in a river s water quality we use the 99 5 confidence intervals as uncertainties in our quoted values to model drivers of long term variation in chl a we extended the above qr approach to allow for multiple predictor variables liu and wu 2009 using aicc to select the best fitting model from a set of a priori candidate models finally we used logit regression to assess whether there has been a change over time in the rate of attainment of statutory compliance for

the rate of increase in the upper river is more than double that of the basin using multiple quantile regression we explored the underlying drivers of this long term variation in charles river chl a based on aicc we identified the best fitting final model from among a pool of a priori candidate models all assessed percentiles 25th 50th 75th and 95th of chl a had roughly the same ordering of relative model quality with models that excluded tp strongly contra indicated and more extreme percentiles requiring more model terms to achieve similar relative goodness of fit table 3 for example the 25th percentile was explained by a model of two terms at a aicc of 71 whereas comparable values of aicc for the 50th percentile required a minimum of three terms and higher percentiles required four terms our final model includes water temperature tp precipitation and river segment of the sample site upper river coded 0 vs the basin coded 1 as predictors table 3 the effects of water

precipitation on chl a was significantly negative at all observed quantiles p 0 001 the river segment signal was particularly strong with the basin holding much of the observed variation in chl a we compared the measured and model predicted chl a concentrations for the 25 3 50 3 75 3 and 95 3 percentiles of the full data set our model is reasonably powerful correctly predicting depending on percentile 36 to 53 of observations fig 6 phycocyanin concentrations in the basin have also significantly if gently declined over the 5 year period 2015 2019 for which data are available when averaged by day to remove high frequency volatility from the data phycocyanin concentrations have declined by roughly 0 2 units year a significant decrease given the daily average phycocyanin concentrations are of order 1 unit a strong seasonality is present with cyanobacteria increasing during june and peaking in july or august depending on year and annually in mid september fig 2 peak chl a events in

samples from the data and determining the correlation coefficient repeated for 100 000 re samplings of the data the observed correlation coefficient between chl a and phycocyanin remained mildly significant r 0 47 p 0 04 4 discussion urbanization impacts on river ecosystems world wide are large and extensive globally up to 63 of rivers are no longer free flowing due to fragmentation by dams and loss of source sea connectivity grill et al 2019 urban infrastructure has altered natural flow regimes and increased contaminant loading resulting in a degradation of water quality that has in turn increased attention to rehabilitation mcgrane 2016 the charles river system is a microcosm of this global trend and provides a unique opportunity to understand the long term drivers of urban river eutrophication and subsequent whole ecosystem responses to mitigation our analysis of long term charles river water quality data indicates that the system is responding favorably albeit slowly to phosphorus management efforts fig 2 we report that tp a routinely used surrogate for trophic state and potential primary productivity has declined river wide by 34 µg l over 23 years although tp concentrations river wide remain near or above the mesotrophic eutrophic boundary the observed net change in tp is roughly equal to the difference between an oligotrophic and eutrophic system using traditional lake criteria and more recently developed criteria for streams carlson and simpson 1996 dodds et al 1998 importantly from a eutrophication mitigation standpoint the fraction of the tp that is most bioavailable to producers orthophosphate po4 3 has also significantly declined on average accordingly average phytoplankton chl a declined by 5 µg l over 23 years although significant changes are restricted to sites upstream of the basin fig 2 by these metrics p loading to the river and the total standing crop of phytoplankton have generally been reduced consistent with federally mandated phosphorus mitigation efforts under the cwa and more specifically the clean charles river initiative implemented in the late 1990s coughlin 2005 weiskel et al 2005 a seasonal mean target of 10 µg l chl a was set river wide for compliance under the cwa and this target continues to be achieved about 75 of the time in the upper river and has more recently been attained in the basin fig 4 using the canonical definitions of statistical significance there has been no change in statutory seasonal chl a compliance rates although the evidence suggests a positive trend in the basin while phytoplankton biomass was already lower and closer to compliance targets in the upper river the upper river is roughly as likely to attain compliance in a given year as it was 23 years ago from a strict statistical sense if at least one of the next two years of seasonal averages meets the requirement in the basin the slope in our logit regression would be significant and positive indicating increased compliance rates in the basin over time we stress that this measure is somewhat artificial depending upon somewhat arbitrary measures of statistical significance p 0 05 and compliance 10 μg l but it is of course upon these arbitrary standards that policy is built phytoplankton biomass in the charles river and especially the basin is stimulated by increases in tp but not tn with the highest chl a observations typically occurring at tn tp 29 by mass fig 5 given that the observed tn tp ratio is generally 7 1 by mass the redfield ratio the charles river phytoplankton community is more likely to be p limited on average redfield 1958 kalff 2002 dodds and smith 2016 and the reduction in tp over time has accordingly caused the tn tp ratio to increase significantly river wide trending further toward p limitation although it is important to note that limitation status may vary seasonally ammonium nh4 a highly bioavailable form of n has significantly declined on average along with p suggesting the same management strategies to control p in the charles river have also been effective at reducing nh4 however there has been no long term effect of these efforts on tn and nitrate nitrite concentrations in the charles river indeed we actually detected a mild negative influence of tn on chl a in the basin continued management efforts to reduce p loading may thus result in further concomitant reductions in river phytoplankton biomass jones and lee 1986 schindler et al 2016 although reducing p concentrations in rivers has not always resulted in timely attainment of expected water quality targets due to long time lags nonlinear responses and the decoupling of phytoplankton biomass from p jarvie et al 2013 efforts to target and successfully eliminate discrete point sources of p to the river system may also increase the importance of more diffuse non point sources to the annual p loading budget which may differ in chemical composition bioavailability and timing of delivery withers and jarvie 2008 of particular concern is the continued presence of potentially harmful bloom forming cyanobacteria in the basin fig 2 summer fall phytoplankton blooms in the basin tend to be dominated by n fixing cyanobacteria including aphanizomenon and anabaena crwa unpubl that may have competitive advantage at the low tn tp ratios 29 1 by mass characteristic of the basin fig 5 and culturally eutrophic lakes given their ability to utilize compensatory atmospheric n2 schindler 1977 smith 1983 concern that any nutrient abatement effort that shifts the stoichiometry to n limitation will promote n fixing cyanobacteria has been a leading argument for p only management of eutrophication in inland waters schindler et al 2016 although low n p ratios alone and long term reductions in n loading have not generally been met by compensatory increases in n fixing cyanobacteria scott and mccarthy 2010 shatwell and köhler 2019 using a multiple qr approach and aicc we identified tp water temperature precipitation and river segment upper river vs the basin as the best predictors of chl a variation at the quarterly sampling frequency and decadal extent of the dataset river segment captures critical spatial variation in phytoplankton dynamics in the charles river with sites within the basin having significantly higher phytoplankton biomass than sites in the upper river fig 3 given the large and ecologically important spatial variation we observed in the responses of the upper river versus the basin fig 2 3 4 the data continue to support management of the upper river and basin as distinct hydrologic entities with unique underlying drivers consistent with similar studies we found that water temperature and tp are significant positive forcings on river chl a basu and pick 1995 balbi 2000 bukaveckas et al 2011 the growth rate of most north temperate eukaryotic phytoplankton taxa is an increasing function of temperature up to an optimum of 15 25 c with prokaryotic bloom forming cyanobacteria generally having higher optimal growth temperatures of 25 32 c paerl 2018 although water column tp includes the organic p contained in phytoplankton cells and has therefore been criticized for its lack of statistical independence as a predictor of phytoplankton biomass lewis and wurtsbaugh 2008 tp concentration is more reliable over the long term than bioavailable inorganic nutrients e g po4 3 nh4 and no3 for predicting phytoplankton biomass in p limited systems kalff 2002 inorganic nutrients were not significant predictors of charles river chl a at this sampling frequency which may reflect their rapid turnover rates and generally high short term variability that would not be captured by this dataset we found that precipitation is a better predictor of long term chl a dynamics in the charles river than discharge and that it is a negative forcing precipitation likely integrates the effects of discharge on primary productivity with those of nutrient loading via urban runoff and combined sewer overflows historically important sources of p to the charles river during periods of intense rainfall possibly explaining its predictive superiority over discharge alone further the negative forcing of precipitation on chl a implies a dominant flushing effect of precipitation on phytoplankton biomass through increased river discharge bukaveckas et al 2011 jeong et al 2011 particularly in the upper river temperate river phytoplankton are more likely to be limited by discharge than nutrients when the water residence time wrt is 3 days basu and pick 1996 which occurs in the free flowing reaches massdep 2011 whereas median wrt in the basin is 21 days with an inter quartile range of 15 to 35 days massdep 2007 approximately 70 of the annual loads of both n and p to the basin are delivered during dry weather conditions breault et al 2002 and increased precipitation may also dilute nutrient concentrations when point sources dominate nutrient loading balbi 2000 ultimately nutrients and phytoplankton biomass that are flushed downstream to the more lentic impounded basin can accumulate which almost certainly explains some of the observed spatial variation in the long term responses of chl a see below qr has only recently been employed in the study of lake eutrophication management where it has been found to improve eutrophication modeling by reducing the uncertainty in critical nutrient limitation thresholds and to identify statistically robust lake specific management strategies xu et al 2015 vinçon leite and casenave 2019 to our knowledge ours is among the first applications of qr in the long term study of river eutrophication an approach that can help isolate specific river sites requiring management attention focus future monitoring efforts and also critically provides information about which segments of the data are changing or not by examining specific percentiles of practical use and ecological significance gao et al 2020 for example we detected through qr that both the highest and lowest percentiles i e below the 1st and above the 84th 95th of tp and chl a are unchanging the lack of change in tp and chl a at statistically extreme percentiles may be due in part to sample size limitations as by definition statistically extreme percentiles contain relatively few observations this statistical artifact may be especially pronounced at the lowest percentiles e g the 1st where the data are also constrained against the floor of 0 and so we would expect lower percentiles to decline slower over time than higher percentiles indeed higher percentiles of chl a have consistently steeper negative slopes than lower percentiles up to the 94th percentile but this pattern reverses for the 95th and higher percentiles which show no significant slope and thus no change in the highest concentrations of chl a during the entire span of record this latter observation instead reflects a persistence of large episodic and generally localized summer fall phytoplankton bloom events particularly in the basin the ability to identify and isolate these patterns statistically at scientifically meaningful user defined percentiles is the major benefit to using qr over traditional data averaging and olsr methods xu et al 2015 gao et al 2020 in the case of the charles river olsr successfully identifies overall significant declines on average but conceals the lack of trends in the highest percentiles the ones of greatest management and public health concern that are only revealed by qr fig 2 since these highest observations of chl a are positively correlated with the biomass of potentially harmful cyanobacteria in the basin fig 7 understanding the short term drivers of these problematic events at the site specific scale may be critical for further controlling their occurrence ideally future management efforts would be directed at mitigating these persistent ecologically high impact statistically low frequency events management targets and water quality assessments based on ecologically defined percentiles may in fact be more meaningful than those based on average conditions since a decrease in the highest percentiles of a monitored impairment like cyanobacteria biomass is arguably the most direct evidence for improvement despite statistically significant decreases in water column tp and phycocyanin cyanobacteria the chl a response in the basin remains stalled as is commonly observed during the recovery of culturally eutrophic shallow lakes due to hysteresis scheffer et al 1993 which can take years to decades to overcome søndergaard et al 2003 effler and o donnell 2010 this lagging response fig 2 4 is also not surprising given the hydrology of the charles river system the basin constitutes the lowest point in a heavily urbanized watershed fig 1 with 81 of the annual p and n loads originating from upstream breault et al 2002 however the elimination of hydraulic and tidal flushing in this segment through the impounding of the river mouth creates an artificially lentic environment that promotes the sequestration of nutrients in the river sediments this may act as a positive feedback on eutrophication through the internal loading of bioavailable po4 3 during periods when the sediments are overlaid by anoxic water søndergaard et al 2003 james 2017 density stratification of the water column in the lower basin occurs with vertical gradients in both temperature and salinity due to saltwater intrusion from boston

cyanobacteria smith et al 1987 watson et al 1997 downing et al 2001 recovery of the basin itself is therefore likely to continue to follow the trajectory observed in most shallow eutrophic lakes hilton et al 2006 the effects of ongoing climate change including gradual warming and changes in precipitation patterns may further influence the basin s rate of recovery withers and jarvie 2008 downscaled temperature and precipitation projections pierce et al 2014 from coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 models through 2097 are available for the charles river basin 2 2 https resilientma org datagrapher c temp basin maxt ann charles by the end of the model period 2080 to 2097 projected annual precipitation rises by roughly 10 cm or 8 above the 1971 2000 median but due to strong seasonal effects 60 to 80 of this increase falls in winter and spring while summer precipitation remains flat projected annual maximum air temperatures increase by nearly 4 c over the same period with higher increases in summer and fall and lower increases in spring and winter while the uncertainties in these projections are admittedly large the seasonal effects are consistent and expected long term increases in winter and spring precipitation coupled with comparatively drier summers will based on the models we developed here aggravate phytoplankton growth in the charles river summer temperature increases are particularly worrisome and will only exacerbate the underlying causes of poor water quality as days per summer with maximum air temperatures higher than 32 2 c and 35 c 90 f and 95 f increase by roughly 30 and 15 d respectively by the 2080 2097 period this increase an entire additional month of days with temperatures 32 c in a three month period will increase stratification stability and promote bottom anoxia in the basin and thus favor an increased frequency and severity of summer fall habs paerl and huisman 2008 elliott 2012 kosten et al 2012 given the weak secular improvement in seasonal chl a compliance see above it is currently unclear which slow process policy driven improvement in hab forcing or anthropogenic climate change will dominate the future of the charles river the persistent statistically high observations of both tp and phytoplankton biomass particularly in the basin are detectable even at the quarterly sampling scale of this dataset while datasets like the one we analyzed are very useful for assessing overall net responses to eutrophication mitigation and the underlying drivers at the seasonal and decadal scales minaudo et al 2015 dodds and smith 2016 existing publicly available data for the charles river are of insufficient frequency to model and predict individual phytoplankton bloom events which are ultimately the episodes that have the greatest social and economic impacts cyanobacteria blooms in particular can be highly stochastic events that culminate from a complex interaction of many internal physical chemical and biological factors and external climatic factors these signals can be transient hours days and highly dynamic such as nutrient releases from the sediments rapid nutrient turnover during periods of bloom growth and senescence and interactions between temperature and wind affecting water column stability soranno 1997 jacoby et al 2000 huber et al 2012 thus detecting long term responses to eutrophication remediation not only requires sufficient data across years to detect net changes but also sufficient data within years particularly during the growing season to assess whether the frequency and intensity of individual bloom events is also changing this requirement for higher frequency data is particularly critical for understanding the eutrophication recovery of flowing systems such as river networks which are inherently spatially and temporally dynamic balbi 2000 minaudo et al 2015 bowes et al 2016 cultural eutrophication of lakes and their long term responses to

paradigms successful passage of landmark environmental legislation and the development of best management practices for impaired inland lakes although historically less emphasized by limnologists rivers and streams have long been recognized as catchments conduits and reactors for materials like nutrients hynes 1975 vannote et al 1980 and thus serve critically in the hydrological and ecological connectivity of the terrestrial landscape and downstream waters both fresh and marine wiens 2002 fergus et al 2017 mitigating negative downstream effects of nutrient loading to surface waters therefore requires understanding of eutrophication dynamics of nutrient impaired rivers boesch 2019 and recognizing that the relative importance of different eutrophication drivers is not uniform across aquatic ecosystems hecky and kilham 1988 for example emphasis on p management to control eutrophication in inland waters may overlook the problem of large scale anthropogenic inputs of n and its transport by rivers to coastal marine systems where n limitation is more pervasive and the fact that productivity in many inland waters is frequently co limited by both n and p howarth and marino 2006 elser et al 2007 paerl et al 2018 despite all of this recognition scientific understanding of river eutrophication and the subsequent response to mitigation efforts has substantially lagged behind that of lakes and our study represents a direct response to a recent call for analyses of eutrophication recovery in rivers using existing long term water quality data dodds and smith 2016 there has been laudable success over the long term in reducing tp chl a and cyanobacteria biomass in the charles river system although our analysis also illuminates the protracted lagging nature of the recovery and where responses have thus far fallen short of targets the need for similar analyses of river systems is heightened by ongoing and complex global change which will likely alter the recovery rate and trajectory of these ecosystems and necessitate employing more powerful statistical approaches 5 conclusions by the 1990s charles river water quality was severely degraded a large management initiative to mitigate eutrophication began and after 2 decades of p abatement significant progress has been made when simply considering average changes tp chl a and cyanobacteria biomass have all significantly declined although the success of water quality policies is often determined by attaining some average response target analyses like ordinary least square regression that consider only the average response can conceal critical patterns and signals in the data that are of management concern such as the persistence of statistically high concentrations of tp and chl a despite favorable trends quantile regression revealed that the highest chl a concentrations associated with annual blooms of potentially harmful cyanobacteria have not yet subsided and there has been no detectable improvement to date in the rate of attaining the seasonal chl a target for policy compliance our analysis thus illuminates the protracted lagging response of chl a and cyanobacteria to p abatement in a major urban river system and emphasizes the long term and incremental nature of its recovery we demonstrate the continuing need for long term analyses of river eutrophication and remediation and the utility of quantile regression in water quality analyses to more rigorously assess changes in statistically low frequency ecologically high impact events declaration of competing

16809,the artificial sweetener acesulfame ace has been frequently detected in wastewater treatment plants wwtps and is regarded as an emerging pollutant due to its low biodegradability however recent observations of ace biodegradation in wwtps have stimulated interest in the ace degrading bacteria and mineralization pathways in this study next generation sequencing methods illumina and nanopore sequencing were combined to explore the ace degrading communities enriched from the activated sludge of six municipal wastewater treatment plants metagenomic investigations indicated that all enrichments were similarly dominated by the phyla proteobacteria and planctomycetes notably at the species level four metagenome assembled genomes mags were shared by six enriched communities with considerable abundances indicating that they may be responsible for ace biodegradation in the enrichments besides two ace degrading pure strains affiliated to the genus chelatococcus were isolated from the enrichment the genomic analysis showed that these two isolates were the new species that were genetically distinct from their relatives two type strains chelatococcus asaccharovorans dsm 6462 and chelatococcus composti dsm 101465 could not degrade ace implying that the ace degrading capability was not shared among the different species in the genus chelatococcus the results of the degradation experiment showed that the two isolates could use ace as the sole carbon source and mineralize 90 of the total organic carbon three biotransformation products tp96 tp180b and tp182b were demonstrated by uplc qtof ms the results of this study provide valuable insights into ace biodegradation and its biotransformation products graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords acesulfame chelatococcus biodegradation genome centric transformation products 1 introduction artificial sweeteners have been recognized as an emerging class of pollutants with growing global concern among artificial sweeteners acesulfame potassium ace was developed in the early 1970s clauss and jensen 1973 and is widely used in low calorie beverages and food pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries owing to its cost effectiveness and higher sweetening power than table sugar ace is not metabolized in the human body after ingestion and is excreted in a primarily unchanged via urine hence it reaches to the aquatic environment via the discharge of municipal wastewater volz et al 1991 furthermore natural removal processes have previously had negligible effects on ace concentration subedi and kannan 2014 tran et al 2015 therefore tremendous consumption of ace has resulted in its ubiquitous presence in aquatic environments worldwide including surface water buerge et al 2009 gan et al 2013 tran et al 2014 yang et al 2017 ground water buerge et al 2009 gan et al 2013 tran et al 2014 tap water buerge et al 2009 gan et al 2013 nödler et al 2013 and marine water brumovský et al 2017 sang et al 2014 additionally an ace concentration as high as 2 5 mg l has been observed in wastewater treatment plants wwtps loos et al 2013 in recent years studies on ace degradation are garnering significant interest in environmental fields in 2009 the first study on ace removal was conducted by buerge et al 2009 which demonstrated a persistent presence of ace in nine wwtps in switzerland additionally the persistence of ace in wwtps has also been reported in germany scheurer et al 2011 china gan et al 2013 korea ryu et al 2014 the usa subedi and kannan 2014 and singapore tran et al 2015 ace has been regarded as an ideal tracer for identifying anthropogenic contamination in many studies considering its sources and persistence in the environment buerge et al 2009 scheurer et al 2011 spoelstra et al 2013 zhao et al 2020 however it is of vital importance to understand the fates of ace in the environments given its potential risk of promoting the spread of antibiotic resistance genes yu et al 2021 accumulating evidence has demonstrated the biodegradability of ace the first study on ace removal in wwtps revealed that 41 of ace can be removed by conventional treatments scheurer et al 2009 since then several studies have confirmed the removal of ace in wwtps and other systems worldwide cardenas et al 2016 falås et al 2016 kahl et al 2018 tran et al 2019 yang et al 2017 as demonstrated by a batch experiment the degradation of ace by activated sludge can be well described by a pseudo first order kinetic reaction with a total removal rate of more than 94 in 27 hours castronovo et al 2017 another lab scale study reported that ace can be catabolized completely by an enrichment culture with ace as the sole carbon source and phyllobacteriaceae methylophilaceae bradyrhizobiaceae and pseudomonadaceae might be involved in ace degradation as demonstrated by a 16s analysis kahl et al 2018 recently two strains identified as bosea sp and chelatococcus sp which can utilize ace as the sole carbon source were isolated from activated sludge by kleinsteuber et al 2019 however currently limited information is available on the kinetics genomic characterization of ace degrading bacteria and their biotransformation products with the development of long read sequencing technologies hybrid assembly is garnering significant interest for obtaining high quality and near complete assemblies as it combines the accuracy of short reads and the structural resolving power of long reads wick et al 2017 the goal of the present study was to investigate the biodegradation of ace by enriched consortia seeded with activated sludge and pure cultures via metagenomic and genomic analysis in this study six ace degrading microbial consortia were enriched from the activated sludge of six municipal wwtps in hong kong and characterized by metagenomic sequencing combining illumina and nanopore techniques two isolates and two type strains affiliated with chelatococcus were examined for their ability to biodegrade ace the genomes of these ace degrading strains were further sequenced and assembled to explore the candidate enzymes responsible for ace biodegradation eventually the degradation kinetics degradation products and performance in real wastewater of one isolate chelatococcus sp yt9 were further estimated 2 methods and materials 2 1 chemicals ace

produced by barnstead easypure uv uf water purification system 2 2 setup and operation of the reactors six batch reactors were used to enrich the ace degrading consortia the reactors were seeded with activated sludge obtained from six local wastewater treatment plants namely shatin sai kung stanley shek wu hui yuen long and tai po sewage treatment works a total of 200 ml of activated sludge was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min and then inoculated into 150 ml synthetic wastewater the synthetic wastewater was prepared with a defined mineral salt medium msm si table s1 deng et al 2016 and different amounts of sodium acetate and ace were used as the carbon sources during the enrichment fig s1 the reactors were operated in a repeated batch mode at 25 c the hydraulic retention time hrt was initially set at 6 days and then decreased during the trial to increase the total organic carbon toc loading capacities of the enriched ace degrading consortia fig s1 the reactors were sealed with perforated sealing film and stirred for aeration the supernatants were collected at the end of every repeated batch for toc measurements the enrichments were collected after 90 and 188 days to measure the ace degradation rates in reactors and conducting metagenomic sequencing briefly 10 ml of sludge was obtained from the reactors to determine the biomass and 3 2 ml supernatant was removed at specific intervals to measure toc and ace depletion the specific degradation rates of toc and ace were calculated accordingly and normalized against the biomass 2 3 isolation of ace degrading strains the activated sludge sampled from six enrichments obtained after the 90th day was used to isolate ace degraders the ace degrading bacterial strains were finally isolated from the ace degrading consortium shatin the consortium was serially diluted with pbs buffer and plated onto selective mineral salt agar media msm 250 mg l ace 1 5 agar all plates were incubated for 10 days at 25 c 30 c and 37 c at harvest 30 unpurified colonies were transferred to 5 ml liquid msm containing 100 mg l ace and incubated at 25 c in a rotator shaker 200 rpm for two months the ace degrading samples were plated onto the selective mineral salt agar media again and purified by streaking the colonies on lb agar media finally two ace degraders denoted yt9 and hy11 were isolated and stored in 20 v v glycerol at 80 c before further experiments afterward two type strains chelatococcus asaccharovorans dsm 6462 and chelatococcus composti dsm 101465 were purchased from dsmz german collection of

on 16s rrna genes by mega x v10 0 5 kumar et al 2018 the genomes of strains yt9 hy11 dsm 6462 and dsm 101465 were also annotated by the ncbi prokaryotic genome annotation pipeline v5 2 and the proteins were clustered by cd hit v4 8 1 li and godzik 2006 at an identity of 70 the proteins that were only shared by yt9 and hy11 were selected and annotated by kofamkoala aramaki et al 2020 2 6 degradation assay of isolates unless otherwise specified incubation and degradation assay were performed at 30 c under aerobic conditions biomass was determined by measuring the optical density at 595

were resuspended in 200 ml of fresh msm and incubated overnight for the consumption of their internal storage products the cells were centrifuged and resuspended in 320 ml of fresh msm with 250 mg l ace as the sole carbon source to obtain an initial od595 of 0 1 the cells were incubated with constant rotation for 48 h and were then transferred to the fresh ace media for further incubation 120

analytical methods toc was measured by a shimadzu total organic carbon analyzer toc v cph to monitor the performance of ace enrichment consortia the concentrations of mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss were determined monthly according to standard methods federation and association 2005 ace was identified by uplc ms ms acquity uplc system waters and quantified after correcting the matrix effect using a method described in previous studies deng et al 2016 instrument control data acquisition and evaluation were performed with masslynx v4 1 software waters the quantification limit was 0 01 μg l the sample 10 μl was injected into a beh c18 column 2 1 50 mm 1 7 μm at 50 c the mobile phase was composed of 20 mm ammonium acetate in water and

leung 2019 3 results and discussions 3 1 enrichment of ace degrading consortia as shown in fig 1 a toc concentrations in the effluents of six reactors were higher than those observed in the influents at the beginning of enrichment suggesting the decay of inoculum biomass the effluent toc declined with the progress of incubation to a value below that of the influent toc of ace after 30 days fig 1b indicating effective enrichment of the ace degrading consortia after 80 days of enrichment all reactors demonstrated ace degradation rates of 95 meanwhile ace degradation by enriched consortia followed zero order kinetics r2 0 96 fig s2 indicating that the degradation rates were independent of the ace concentration in these systems after 90 days ace degradation rates ranged from 1 21 to 2 57 mg toc g vss h 1 and increased to 3 17 5 27 mg toc g vss h 1 after 188 days fig 1c implying increased capacity of the enriched consortia to degrade ace 3 2 reconstruction of mags and taxonomy assignments a total of 239 dereplicated mags were obtained from 6 enriched consortia including 175 near complete mags 90 completeness and 5 contamination and 64 medium quality mags 70 completeness and 10 contamination over 77 of the total sequences could be aligned to these mags and 45 dominant mags abundance 3 accounted for the majority of the metagenomic reads 49 1 61 2 furthermore in the 45 dominant mags 41 mags were near complete mags and 11 mags contained less than 5 contigs indicating that the approach of hybrid assembly using illumina short reads and nanopore long reads was effective in determining high quality and contiguous mags in abundant species the dominant mags were classified into eight phyla fig 2 and table s3 proteobacteria contained the highest number of mags 16 mags followed by the planctomycetes 12 mags bacteroidetes 8 mags armatimonadetes 3 mags and chloroflexi 3 mags certain phyla such as actinobacteria gemmatimonadetes and nitrospirae contained only one mag however less than 65 of 45 dominant mags abundance 3 could be classified at family or a lower taxonomic level by the current ncbi and gtdb databases after being enriched for 188 days proteobacteria and planctomycetes accounted for an average relative abundance of 19 4 and 21 5 respectively in all six ace degrading consortia the possible functional niches of these species may have determined their ability to dominate in the culture hence these species shared by six enrichments may be responsible for ace degradation in the enriched consortia at the family level chelatococcaceae pro4 pro6 xanthobacteraceae pro7 pro9 and phycisphaeraceae pla1 pla12 were shared by the six enriched communities at the species level only pro4 pro6 pro9 and gem1 were shared by six enrichments showing considerable abundances besides pro4 pro9 were grouped together and affiliated to the same order hyphomicrobiales indicating that these species might play an important role in ace biodegradation the relative abundance of pro4 showed an increasing trend reaching values ranging from 4 82 11 09 in shatin sai kung stanley and tai po enrichments meanwhile a dominating presence alternating between pro4 6 26 on the 90th day and pro6 6 82 on the 188th day of the chelatococcus species was observed in the shek wu hui enrichment and the other chelatococcus species pro5 0 88 flourished only in the shatin enrichment on the 90th day with a relative abundance of 18 26 the population of the species pro9 was dominant in the yuen long enrichment on the 188th day the species gem1 was only active on the 90th day in shek wu hui yuen long and tai po enrichments and was gradually washed out following the adjustment of the hrt from 3 days to 2 days 3 3 identification and characterization of the genomes of ace degrading isolates two ace degrading strains yt9 and hy11 were isolated from the shatin enrichment both strains could completely mineralize 250 mg l of ace with an average rate of 10 82 mg ace g vss h 1 and 4 52 mg ace g vss h 1 respectively table s4 the phylogenetic evaluation showed that the two isolates were grouped together with two newly discovered ace degrading chelatococcus species sp 1g 2 and 1g 11 kleinsteuber et al 2019 as a monophyletic sister group they were both identified as the chelatococcus species and were closely related to chelatococcus asaccharovorans dsm 6462 fig 3 a however two type strains chelatococcus asaccharovorans dsm 6462 and chelatococcus composti dsm 101465 did not exhibit ace degrading capacity after a 14 day incubation fig s3 and table s4 the results demonstrate that the ace degrading ability was not shared among the different species of the genus chelatococcus as shown in fig 3b pairwise comparisons of ani and aai demonstrated a high similarity between yt9 and mag pro5 based on the high ani and aai values of 99 97 and 99 92 respectively the isolate hy11 and two mags pro4 and pro6 could be classified into the same species based on their high ani aai 98 values ani 95 indicates intra species strains and ani 83 indicates inter species strains jain et al 2018 moreover pro4 and pro6 gradually flourished in all six enriched consortia with the relative abundance increasing up to 11 09 and 6 82 respectively hence based on a high similarity with the ace degraders hy11 and yt9 pro6 pro4 and pro5 affiliated to chelatococcus may be the major degraders of ace in the six enriched microbial communities although yt9 hy11 pro4 and dsm 6462 were grouped together as a monophyletic group in the phylogenetic tree based on the 16s rrna of selected strains fig 3a the pairwise genome comparisons among yt9 hy11 and other currently known chelatococcus stains suggested that yt9 and hy11 were potentially new species based on their low ani values 85 of ani values when compared with the known species fig 3b in contrast high rates of completeness 100 and 99 37 and identical contamination levels 0 99 were estimated by checkm for the genomes of yt9 and hy11 and the details of their contigs are summarised in table s5 briefly yt9 is composed of 1 circular chromosome 5 plasmids and 1 unclassified short contig while hy11 is composed of 1 circular chromosome and 5 plasmids meanwhile complete genomes of dsm 6462 and dsm 101465 were obtained via reassembly using long reads sequenced in the present study and short reads downloaded from a public database given that dsm 6462 and dsm 101465 failed to degrade ace within 14 days we drew a venn diagram to distinguish proteins shared only by yt9 and hy11 fig s4 cd hit was used to cluster the proteins at 70 sequence identity to form protein clusters which share common functionality however yt9 and hy11 were genetically distinct from their relatives dsm 6462 and dsm 101465 as determined based on their low ani aai values 85 of ani and 88 of aai hence 13 812 proteins of the total proteins of yt9 hy11 were shared only by these two ace degrading bacteria fig s4 these shared genes may comprise the genes encoding ace degradation enzymes and more evidence is required to narrow down the candidates the 812 shared proteins of yt9 and hy11 table s6 include creatinine amidohydrolase ec 3 5 2 10 that can attack the carbonyl carbon of an amide group as demonstrated in a previous study yamamoto et al 1995 given that acetoacetamide n sulfonic acid ansa a reported intermediate of ace biodegradation could be hydrolyzed to sulfamic acid and acetoacetate by attacking the c n bond a protein such as creatinine amidohydrolase might be helpful in this step moreover according to the kegg pathway analysis 3 oxoacid coa transferase ec 2 8 3 5 and 3 hydroxyacyl coa dehydrogenase ec 1 1 1 35 were also included in these 812 proteins and may be involved in utilizing the acetoacetate 3 4 degradation of ace by isolate yt9 strain yt9 was selected for further degradation experiments as it grew faster than hy11 ace was completely degraded by yt9 within 48 h however only 27 7 toc was removed fig 4 a suggesting that some tps were generated from the parent compound ace by yt9 the degradation rate of ace was faster in the second passage compared to the first passage and reached a significantly higher toc removal rate of 91 1 fig 4b three tps were detected by uplc qtof ms analysis namely tp96 tp180b and tp182b fig s5 tp96 was identified as sulfamic acid based on the uplc qtof ms analysis and comparison of the retention time and ms fragmentation spectra with an authentic standard sulfamic acid is the final product of ace photo degradation gan et al 2014 li et al 2016 scheurer et al 2014 and biodegradation castronovo et al 2017 kahl et al 2018 kleinsteuber et al 2019 tp180b and tp182b were other biotransformation tps observed to form with the fragmentation profiles shown in fig s5 compared with the work of castronovo et al 2017 which proposed two structures for tp180 deviations were observed between the reported fragment ions and tp180b determined in the present study yet due to the lack of an authentic standard and structural evidence at this stage it cannot be confirmed whether tp180b is a new structure a new structure was proposed for tp182b with the molecular formula c4h8no5s and the fragment ions at m z 164 0019 c4h6no4s 137 9867 c2h4no4s 102 0561 c4h8no2 and 95 9761 h2no3s it may be a reduction product of tp180b however only a small percentage of tp180b underwent this reduction process regarding high toc removal suggesting that reduction is of limited importance in the oxic environment according to the scale proposed by schymanski et al 2014 tp96 was identified with a confidence level of 1 by comparison with the authentic standard while tp180b and tp182b were identified with a confidence level of 3 schymanski et al 2014 however one reported intermediate ansa was not detected in our experiments it may be caused by the different ace concentrations used in the two experiments 250 mg l and 1 g l meanwhile we speculate that the hydrolysis of ansa to sa and acetoacetate may happen inside the cell which further results in a low ansa concentration in the filtrate tp 180b was formed by the addition of water at the c c bond of ace andgenerated hydrated products indeed there is evidence that the c c bond was first attacked and then followed by the cleavage of other bonds in ace via an advanced oxidation process castronovo et al 2017 gan et al 2014 law and leung 2019 indicating the high susceptibility of the c c bond compared to others meanwhile hydroxylation is a common degradation pathway in biodegradation and was also observed for other organic chemicals for example polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon compounds haritash and kaushik 2009 although three tps were formed in the present study the biodegradation pathway leading to the formation of sulfamic acid from ace is still unclear as tps were only detected in the filtrate and not in the cell lysate fig 5 shows the best fit of the ace degradation rates under environmentally relevant concentrations to the michaelis menten equation fig s6 at the constant biomass of yt9 6 1 mg vss l v max and k m determined from fig 5 were 24 60 mg ace g vss h 1 and 2 47 10 7 mol l respectively indicating a high affinity of yt9 for ace at low initial ace concentrations 8 117 μg l the ace degradation rate increased as a function of the ace concentration a constant ace degradation rate at high ace concentrations 580 1272 μg l indicated competition among ace molecules for the enzyme active sites in yt9 however at an initial ace concentration of 250 mg l the degradation rates of yt9 and hy11 were remarkably lower than the theoretical maximum ace degradation rate v max implying that the bioactivities of ace degrading bacteria were inhibited under a such high concentration in fact there is evidence that ace can cause dna damage in bacteria at clinically relevant ace concentrations bandyopadhyay et al 2008 the removal routes of ace in activated sludge sampled from local wastewater treatment plants and degradation of ace by yt9 in the real wastewater were also investigated the results showed that the removal of ace in the activated sludge by natural processes including hydrolysis volatilization biodegradation and adsorption was negligible fig s7 after incorporating yt9 into the activated sludge derived from the shatin wastewater treatment plant the degradation rates of ace observed with 1 and 2 dose of yt9 were 2 08 and 1 78 mg ace g yt9 vss h 1 respectively fig s8 indicating that yt9 could perform well in the real wastewater 4 conclusion in recent years accumulating evidence indicates that ace can be removed by the biodegradation process a previous study showed successful isolation of pure ace degrading cultures kleinsteuber et al 2019 unfortunately the genome of the degrading bacteria and the tps of ace biodegradation remain largely unknown here we used high throughput metagenomic and nanopore sequencing to characterize the ace enriched consortia and recovered mags to identify ace degrading bacteria we also isolated two pure cultures yt9 and hy11 possibly affiliated to a new species and sequenced their genomes our results further support the recent observation of ace biodegradation by the genus chelatococcus furthermore the comparative genomic analysis of the mags and isolates showed that the potential new species closely related to chelatococcus asaccharovorans could be responsible for ace biodegradation in wwtps the functional enzymes encoded by ace degrading genes were among the 812 candidate enzymes only shared by yt9 and hy11 our results suggest that the ace degrading strain yt9 degrades ace into sulfamic acid with the generation of tp180b and tp182b during the biodegradation process the common intermediate acetoacetamide n sulfonic acid was not detected in our study hence tp180b may be transformed into sulfamic acid inside the cells the limitation of the present study is that it lacks of a complete experimental investigation of the biodegradation pathways as well as the functional enzymes in future studies experimental validation performed using isotope labeling multi omics and gene

16809,the artificial sweetener acesulfame ace has been frequently detected in wastewater treatment plants wwtps and is regarded as an emerging pollutant due to its low biodegradability however recent observations of ace biodegradation in wwtps have stimulated interest in the ace degrading bacteria and mineralization pathways in this study next generation sequencing methods illumina and nanopore sequencing were combined to explore the ace degrading communities enriched from the activated sludge of six municipal wastewater treatment plants metagenomic investigations indicated that all enrichments were similarly dominated by the phyla proteobacteria and planctomycetes notably at the species level four metagenome assembled genomes mags were shared by six enriched communities with considerable abundances indicating that they may be responsible for ace biodegradation in the enrichments besides two ace degrading pure strains affiliated to the genus chelatococcus were isolated from the enrichment the genomic analysis showed that these two isolates were the new species that were genetically distinct from their relatives two type strains chelatococcus asaccharovorans dsm 6462 and chelatococcus composti dsm 101465 could not degrade ace implying that the ace degrading capability was not shared among the different species in the genus chelatococcus the results of the degradation experiment showed that the two isolates could use ace as the sole carbon source and mineralize 90 of the total organic carbon three biotransformation products tp96 tp180b and tp182b were demonstrated by uplc qtof ms the results of this study provide valuable insights into ace biodegradation and its biotransformation products graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords acesulfame chelatococcus biodegradation genome centric transformation products 1 introduction artificial sweeteners have been recognized as an emerging class of pollutants with growing global concern among artificial sweeteners acesulfame potassium ace was developed in the early 1970s clauss and jensen 1973 and is widely used in low calorie beverages and food pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries owing to its cost effectiveness and higher sweetening power than table sugar ace is not metabolized in the human body after ingestion and is excreted in a primarily unchanged via urine hence it reaches to the aquatic environment via the discharge of municipal wastewater volz et al 1991 furthermore natural removal processes have previously had negligible effects on ace concentration subedi and kannan 2014 tran et al 2015 therefore tremendous consumption of ace has resulted in its ubiquitous presence in aquatic environments worldwide including surface water buerge et al 2009 gan et al 2013 tran et al 2014 yang et al 2017 ground water buerge et al 2009 gan et al 2013 tran et al 2014 tap water buerge et al 2009 gan et al 2013 nödler et al 2013 and marine water brumovský et al 2017 sang et al 2014 additionally an ace concentration as high as 2 5 mg l has been observed in wastewater treatment plants wwtps loos et al 2013 in recent years studies on ace degradation are garnering significant interest in environmental fields in 2009 the first study on ace removal was conducted by buerge et al 2009 which demonstrated a persistent presence of ace in nine wwtps in switzerland additionally the persistence of ace in wwtps has also been reported in germany scheurer et al 2011 china gan et al 2013 korea ryu et al 2014 the usa subedi and kannan 2014 and singapore tran et al 2015 ace has been regarded as an ideal tracer for identifying anthropogenic contamination in many studies considering its sources and persistence in the environment buerge et al 2009 scheurer et al 2011 spoelstra et al 2013 zhao et al 2020 however it is of vital importance to understand the fates of ace in the environments given its potential risk of promoting the spread of antibiotic resistance genes yu et al 2021 accumulating evidence has demonstrated the biodegradability of ace the first study on ace removal in wwtps revealed that 41 of ace can be removed by conventional treatments scheurer et al 2009 since then several studies have confirmed the removal of ace in wwtps and other systems worldwide cardenas et al 2016 falås et al 2016 kahl et al 2018 tran et al 2019 yang et al 2017 as demonstrated by a batch experiment the degradation of ace by activated sludge can be well described by a pseudo first order kinetic reaction with a total removal rate of more than 94 in 27 hours castronovo et al 2017 another lab scale study reported that ace can be catabolized completely by an enrichment culture with ace as the sole carbon source and phyllobacteriaceae methylophilaceae bradyrhizobiaceae and pseudomonadaceae might be involved in ace degradation as demonstrated by a 16s analysis kahl et al 2018 recently two strains identified as bosea sp and chelatococcus sp which can utilize ace as the sole carbon source were isolated from activated sludge by kleinsteuber et al 2019 however currently limited information is available on the kinetics genomic characterization of ace degrading bacteria and their biotransformation products with the development of long read sequencing technologies hybrid assembly is garnering significant interest for obtaining high quality and near complete assemblies as it combines the accuracy of short reads and the structural resolving power of long reads wick et al 2017 the goal of the present study was to investigate the biodegradation of ace by enriched consortia seeded with activated sludge and pure cultures via metagenomic and genomic analysis in this study six ace degrading microbial consortia were enriched from the activated sludge of six municipal wwtps in hong kong and characterized by metagenomic sequencing combining illumina and nanopore techniques two isolates and two type strains affiliated with chelatococcus were examined for their ability to biodegrade ace the genomes of these ace degrading strains were further sequenced and assembled to explore the candidate enzymes responsible for ace biodegradation eventually the degradation kinetics degradation products and performance in real wastewater of one isolate chelatococcus sp yt9 were further estimated 2 methods and materials 2 1 chemicals ace analytical standard and sulfamic acid 99 999 of purity were purchased from sigma aldrich usa for ultra performance liquid chromatography uplc analysis methods liquid chromatography lc mass

produced by barnstead easypure uv uf water purification system 2 2 setup and operation of the reactors six batch reactors were used to enrich the ace degrading consortia the reactors were seeded with activated sludge obtained from six local wastewater treatment plants namely shatin sai kung stanley shek wu hui yuen long and tai po sewage treatment works a total of 200 ml of activated sludge was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min and then inoculated into 150 ml synthetic wastewater the synthetic wastewater was prepared with a defined mineral salt medium msm si table s1 deng et al 2016 and different amounts of sodium acetate and ace were used as the carbon sources during the enrichment fig s1 the reactors were operated in a repeated batch mode at 25 c the hydraulic retention time hrt was initially set at 6 days and then decreased during the trial to increase the total organic carbon toc loading capacities of the enriched ace degrading consortia fig s1 the reactors were sealed with perforated sealing film and stirred for aeration the supernatants were collected at the end of every repeated batch for toc measurements the enrichments were collected after 90 and 188 days to measure the ace degradation rates in reactors and conducting metagenomic sequencing briefly 10 ml of sludge was obtained from the reactors to determine the biomass and 3 2 ml supernatant was removed at specific intervals to measure toc and ace depletion the specific degradation rates of toc and ace were calculated accordingly and normalized against the biomass 2 3 isolation of ace degrading strains the activated sludge sampled from six enrichments obtained after the 90th day was used to isolate ace degraders the ace degrading bacterial strains were finally isolated from the ace degrading consortium shatin the consortium was serially diluted with pbs buffer and plated onto selective mineral salt agar media msm 250 mg l ace 1 5 agar all plates were incubated for 10 days at 25 c 30 c and 37 c at harvest 30 unpurified colonies were transferred to 5 ml liquid msm containing 100 mg l ace and incubated at 25 c in a rotator shaker 200 rpm for two months the ace degrading samples were plated onto the selective mineral salt agar media again and purified by streaking the colonies on lb agar media finally two ace degraders denoted yt9 and hy11 were isolated and stored in 20 v v glycerol at 80 c before further experiments afterward two type strains chelatococcus asaccharovorans dsm 6462 and chelatococcus composti dsm 101465 were purchased from dsmz german collection of microorganisms and cell cultures german for further confirmation of the ace biodegrading capability of chelatococcus 2 4 dna extraction and sequencing total dna of the enriched consortia samples 6

were resuspended in 200 ml of fresh msm and incubated overnight for the consumption of their internal storage products the cells were centrifuged and resuspended in 320 ml of fresh msm with 250 mg l ace as the sole carbon source to obtain an initial od595 of 0 1 the cells were incubated with constant rotation for 48 h and were then transferred to the fresh ace media for further incubation 120

analytical methods toc was measured by a shimadzu total organic carbon analyzer toc v cph to monitor the performance of ace enrichment consortia the concentrations of mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss were determined monthly according to standard methods federation and association 2005 ace was identified by uplc ms ms acquity uplc system waters and quantified after correcting the matrix effect using a method described in previous studies deng et al 2016 instrument control data acquisition and evaluation were performed with masslynx v4 1 software waters the quantification limit was 0 01 μg l the sample 10 μl was injected into a beh c18 column 2 1 50 mm 1 7 μm at 50 c the mobile phase was composed of 20 mm ammonium acetate in water and acetonitrile the gradient elution was performed with 85 a 15 b for 2 min at a flow rate of 0 4 ml min nitrogen gas was used as the desolvation and cone gas at a flow rate of 600 l h and 50 l h and argon gas was used to induce dissociation the desolvation temperature and source temperature were set to 400 c and 120 c respectively multiple reactions monitoring was used to collect data

leung 2019 3 results and discussions 3 1 enrichment of ace degrading consortia as shown in fig 1 a toc concentrations in the effluents of six reactors were higher than those observed in the influents at the beginning of enrichment suggesting the decay of inoculum biomass the effluent toc declined with the progress of incubation to a value below that of the influent toc of ace after 30 days fig 1b indicating effective enrichment of the ace degrading consortia after 80 days of enrichment all reactors demonstrated ace degradation rates of 95 meanwhile ace degradation by enriched consortia followed zero order kinetics r2 0 96 fig s2 indicating that the degradation rates were independent of the ace concentration in these systems after 90 days ace degradation rates ranged from 1 21 to 2 57 mg toc g vss h 1 and increased to 3 17 5 27 mg toc g vss h 1 after 188 days fig 1c implying increased capacity of the enriched consortia to degrade ace 3 2 reconstruction of mags and taxonomy assignments a total of 239 dereplicated mags were obtained from 6 enriched consortia including 175 near complete mags 90 completeness and 5 contamination and 64 medium quality mags 70 completeness and 10 contamination over 77 of the total sequences could be aligned to these mags and 45 dominant mags abundance 3 accounted for the majority of the metagenomic reads 49 1 61 2 furthermore in the 45 dominant mags 41 mags were near complete mags and 11 mags contained less than 5 contigs indicating that the approach of hybrid assembly using illumina short reads and nanopore long reads was effective in determining high quality and contiguous mags in abundant species the dominant mags were classified into eight phyla fig 2 and table s3 proteobacteria contained the highest number of mags 16 mags followed by the planctomycetes 12 mags bacteroidetes 8 mags armatimonadetes 3 mags and chloroflexi 3 mags certain phyla such as actinobacteria gemmatimonadetes and nitrospirae contained only one mag however less than 65 of 45 dominant mags abundance 3 could be classified at family or a lower taxonomic level by the current ncbi and gtdb databases after being enriched for 188 days proteobacteria and planctomycetes accounted for an average relative abundance of 19 4 and 21 5 respectively in all six ace degrading consortia the possible functional niches of these species may have determined their ability to dominate in the culture hence these species shared by six enrichments may be responsible for ace degradation in the enriched consortia at the family level chelatococcaceae pro4 pro6 xanthobacteraceae pro7 pro9 and phycisphaeraceae pla1 pla12 were shared by the six enriched communities at the species level only pro4 pro6 pro9 and gem1 were shared by six enrichments showing considerable abundances besides pro4 pro9 were grouped together and affiliated to the same order hyphomicrobiales indicating that these species might play an important role in ace biodegradation the relative abundance of pro4 showed an increasing trend reaching values ranging from 4 82 11 09 in shatin sai kung stanley and tai po enrichments meanwhile a dominating presence alternating between pro4 6 26 on the 90th day and pro6 6 82 on the 188th day of the chelatococcus species was observed in the shek wu hui enrichment and the other chelatococcus species pro5 0 88 flourished only in the shatin enrichment on the 90th day with a relative abundance of 18 26 the population of the species pro9 was dominant in the yuen long enrichment on the 188th day the species gem1 was only active on the 90th day in shek wu hui yuen long and tai po enrichments and was gradually washed out following the adjustment of the hrt from 3 days to 2 days 3 3 identification and characterization of the genomes of ace degrading isolates two ace degrading strains yt9 and hy11 were isolated from the shatin enrichment both strains could completely mineralize 250 mg l of ace with an average rate of 10 82 mg ace g vss h 1 and 4 52 mg ace g vss h 1 respectively table s4 the phylogenetic evaluation showed that the two isolates were grouped together with two newly discovered ace degrading chelatococcus species sp 1g 2 and 1g 11 kleinsteuber et al 2019 as a monophyletic sister group they were both identified as the chelatococcus species and were closely related to chelatococcus asaccharovorans dsm 6462 fig 3 a however two type strains chelatococcus asaccharovorans dsm 6462 and chelatococcus composti dsm 101465 did not exhibit ace degrading capacity after a 14 day incubation fig s3 and table s4 the results demonstrate that the ace degrading ability was not shared among the different species of the genus chelatococcus as shown in fig 3b pairwise comparisons of ani and aai demonstrated a high similarity between yt9 and mag pro5 based on the high ani and aai values of 99 97 and 99 92 respectively the isolate hy11 and two mags pro4 and pro6 could be classified into the same species based on their high ani aai 98 values ani 95 indicates intra species strains and ani 83 indicates inter species strains jain et al 2018 moreover pro4 and pro6 gradually flourished in all six enriched consortia with the relative abundance increasing up to 11 09 and 6 82 respectively hence based on a high similarity with the ace degraders hy11 and yt9 pro6 pro4 and pro5 affiliated to chelatococcus may be the major degraders of ace in the six enriched microbial communities although yt9 hy11 pro4 and dsm 6462 were grouped together as a monophyletic group in the phylogenetic tree based on the 16s rrna of selected strains fig 3a the pairwise genome comparisons among yt9 hy11 and other currently known chelatococcus stains suggested that yt9 and hy11 were potentially new species based on their low ani values 85 of ani values when compared with the known species fig 3b in contrast high rates of completeness 100 and 99 37 and identical contamination levels 0 99 were estimated by checkm for the genomes of yt9 and hy11 and the details of their contigs are summarised in table s5 briefly yt9 is composed of 1 circular chromosome 5 plasmids and 1 unclassified short contig while hy11 is composed of 1 circular chromosome and 5 plasmids meanwhile complete genomes of dsm 6462 and dsm 101465 were obtained via reassembly using long reads sequenced in the present study and short reads downloaded from a public database given that dsm 6462 and dsm 101465 failed to degrade ace within 14 days we drew a venn diagram to distinguish proteins shared only by yt9 and hy11 fig s4 cd hit was used to cluster the proteins at 70 sequence identity to form protein clusters which share common functionality however yt9 and hy11 were genetically distinct from their relatives dsm 6462 and dsm 101465 as determined based on their low ani aai values 85 of ani and 88 of aai hence 13 812 proteins of the total proteins of yt9 hy11 were shared only by these two ace degrading bacteria fig s4 these shared genes may comprise the genes encoding ace degradation enzymes and more evidence is required to narrow down the candidates the 812 shared proteins of yt9 and hy11 table s6 include creatinine amidohydrolase ec 3 5 2 10 that can attack the carbonyl carbon of an amide group as demonstrated in a previous study yamamoto et al 1995 given that acetoacetamide n sulfonic acid ansa a reported intermediate of ace biodegradation could be hydrolyzed to sulfamic acid and acetoacetate by attacking the c n bond a protein such as creatinine amidohydrolase might be helpful in this step moreover according to the kegg pathway analysis 3 oxoacid coa transferase ec 2 8 3 5 and 3 hydroxyacyl coa dehydrogenase ec 1 1 1 35 were also included in these 812 proteins and may be involved in utilizing the acetoacetate 3 4 degradation of ace by isolate yt9 strain yt9 was selected for further degradation experiments as it grew faster than hy11 ace was completely degraded by yt9 within 48 h however only 27 7 toc was removed fig 4 a suggesting that some tps were generated from the parent compound ace by yt9 the degradation rate of ace was faster in the second passage compared to the first passage and reached a significantly higher toc removal rate of 91 1 fig 4b three tps were detected by uplc qtof ms analysis namely tp96 tp180b and tp182b fig s5 tp96 was identified as sulfamic acid based on the uplc qtof ms analysis and comparison of the retention time and ms fragmentation spectra with an authentic standard sulfamic acid is the final product of ace photo degradation gan et al 2014 li et al 2016 scheurer et al 2014 and biodegradation castronovo et al 2017 kahl et al 2018 kleinsteuber et al 2019 tp180b and tp182b were other biotransformation tps observed to form with the fragmentation profiles shown in fig s5 compared with the work of castronovo et al 2017 which proposed two structures for tp180 deviations were observed between the reported fragment ions and tp180b determined in the present study yet due to the lack of an authentic standard and structural evidence at this stage it cannot be confirmed whether tp180b is a new structure a new structure was proposed for tp182b with the molecular formula c4h8no5s and the fragment ions at m z 164 0019 c4h6no4s 137 9867 c2h4no4s 102 0561 c4h8no2 and 95 9761 h2no3s it may be a reduction product of tp180b however only a small percentage of tp180b underwent this reduction process regarding high toc removal suggesting that reduction is of limited importance in the oxic environment according to the scale proposed by schymanski et al 2014 tp96 was identified with a confidence level of 1 by comparison with the authentic standard while tp180b and tp182b were identified with a confidence level of 3 schymanski et al 2014 however one reported intermediate ansa was not detected in our experiments it may be caused by the different ace concentrations used in the two experiments 250 mg l and 1 g l meanwhile we speculate that the hydrolysis of ansa to sa and acetoacetate may happen inside the cell which further results in a low ansa concentration in the filtrate tp 180b was formed by the addition of water at the c c bond of ace andgenerated hydrated products indeed there is evidence that the c c bond was first attacked and then followed by the cleavage of other bonds in ace via an advanced oxidation process castronovo et al 2017 gan et al 2014 law and leung 2019 indicating the high susceptibility of the c c bond compared to others meanwhile hydroxylation is a common degradation pathway in biodegradation and was also observed for other organic chemicals for example polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon compounds haritash and kaushik 2009 although three tps were formed in the present study the biodegradation pathway leading to the formation of sulfamic acid from ace is still unclear as tps were only detected in the filtrate and not in the cell lysate fig 5 shows the best fit of the ace degradation rates under environmentally relevant concentrations to the michaelis menten equation fig s6 at the constant biomass of yt9 6 1 mg vss l v max and k m determined from fig 5 were 24 60 mg ace g vss h 1 and 2 47 10 7 mol l respectively indicating a high affinity of yt9 for ace at low initial ace concentrations 8 117 μg l the ace degradation rate increased as a function of the ace concentration a constant ace degradation rate at high ace concentrations 580 1272 μg l indicated competition among ace molecules for the enzyme active sites in yt9 however at an initial ace concentration of 250 mg l the degradation rates of yt9 and hy11 were remarkably lower than the theoretical maximum ace degradation rate v max implying that the bioactivities of ace degrading bacteria were inhibited under a such high concentration in fact there is evidence that ace can cause dna damage in bacteria at clinically relevant ace concentrations bandyopadhyay et al 2008 the removal routes of ace in activated sludge sampled from local wastewater treatment plants and degradation of ace by yt9 in the real wastewater were also investigated the results showed that the removal of ace in the activated sludge by natural processes including hydrolysis volatilization biodegradation and adsorption was negligible fig s7 after incorporating yt9 into the activated sludge derived from the shatin wastewater treatment plant the degradation rates of ace observed with 1 and 2 dose of yt9 were 2 08 and 1 78 mg ace g yt9 vss h 1 respectively fig s8 indicating that yt9 could perform well in the real wastewater 4 conclusion in recent years accumulating evidence indicates that ace can be removed by the biodegradation process a previous study showed successful isolation of pure ace degrading cultures kleinsteuber et al 2019 unfortunately the genome of the degrading bacteria and the tps of ace biodegradation remain largely unknown here we used high throughput metagenomic and nanopore sequencing to characterize the ace enriched consortia and recovered mags to identify ace degrading bacteria we also isolated two pure cultures yt9 and hy11 possibly affiliated to a new species and sequenced their genomes our results further support the recent observation of ace biodegradation by the genus chelatococcus furthermore the comparative genomic analysis of the mags and isolates showed that the potential new species closely related to chelatococcus asaccharovorans could be responsible for ace biodegradation in wwtps the functional enzymes encoded by ace degrading genes were among the 812 candidate enzymes only shared by yt9 and hy11 our results suggest that the ace degrading strain yt9 degrades ace into sulfamic acid with the generation of tp180b and tp182b during the biodegradation process the common intermediate acetoacetamide n sulfonic acid was not detected in our study hence tp180b may be transformed into sulfamic acid inside the cells the limitation of the present study is that it lacks of a complete experimental investigation of the biodegradation pathways as well as the functional enzymes in future studies experimental validation performed using isotope labeling multi omics and gene knockout analysis will be needed to examine the complete biodegradation pathways of ace and to confirm the functional enzymes in ace degraders data availability the genomes of yt9 and hy11 have been archived in the joint genome institute s img m database under genome ids 2860216311 and 2860209820 respectively all 239 mags and the genomes of the pure cultures used in the present study have been
