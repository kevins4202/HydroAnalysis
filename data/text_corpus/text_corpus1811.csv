9055,the living filter at pennsylvania state university in central pennsylvania receives on average 1 5 million gallons per day mgd of secondary treated wastewater effluent year round since 1962 the objective of this study was to identify and relate any bedrock fracture traces and surface depressions to any surficial or geomorphologic processes currently underway as a result of irrigation the living filter is underlain by a massive dolomite with fractures trending near n s that were previously documented using photogrammetry a manual process was developed in order to determine the trend and location of several fracture traces within the astronomy site section of the living filter a semi automated isolation scheme was next used to identify and correlate closed depressions to the location of fracture traces in the living filter a predominant but slight ne sw trend was observed among fractures at n5e in the area north of the pennsylvania furnace anticline a high occurrence of depressions was noted in the area of fractures compared to non fractured bedrock the depressions in this area were found to have a net gain of 8000 ft2 the result of which was from the net loss of 5000 ft2 within the agricultural portion of the site and a net gain of 13 000 ft2 within the forested portion of the site cross sections of several depressions within cropped areas indicated a lower angle slope corresponding to a v shape while depressions within forested areas were characterized by a traditional u shape and previously established steeper slope these findings will enhance the current understanding of the different morphologic characteristics of both forested and agricultural depressions in karst topography the workflows implemented here can be implemented in similar sites that display topographical variances from the bedrock fractures keywords closed hillslope depression fracture lineament wastewater reuse irrigation karst system data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction knowledge of fractures and their patterns and networks in rock is essential for scientific technological and economic purposes analysis and interpretation of rock fractures and their patterns and networks are critical to understand earth science processes and to engineer and manage surface and subsurface systems laubach et al 2019 fractures are defined as mechanical breaks in rocks involving discontinuities in displacement across surfaces or narrow zones national research council 1996 fractures are key elements of the geological processes that influence pathways rates and heterogeneities of fluid flow and redistribution as well as rock strength and connectivity between surface and subsurface environments bear et al 1993 berkowitz 2002 de dreuzy et al 2012 wang 1991 wang et al 2022 therefore fractures serve as pathways for flow phenomena and transport processes occurring in systems such as groundwater and aquifers as well as hydrocarbon reservoirs and impacting the fate and transport of contaminants national research council 1996 fractures may influence surface processes such as the surface depressions that frequently occur with underground fracture zones understanding the impact of fractures their patterns and networks on the surface processes is important for water resources engineering and management particularly in the case of long term application of wastewater reuse irrigation in agriculture such as the living filter in state college pa which is a secondary treated wastewater irrigated forested and agricultural site in a karst landscape in the nittany valley of central pennsylvania fig s1 both the underlying geology and the depth of the unconfined aquifer must be considered when determining the placement of a wastewater irrigation site ensuring the efficacy of wastewater irrigation requires soil that is adequately permeable to ensure the infiltration of wastewater and which is also characterized by adequate periods for both denitrification and retention although wastewater reuse concepts are mostly used in predominantly arid and semi arid climates such as the middle east and north africa mena some parts of europe and the western united states hamilton et al 2007 regions that are characterized by delicate surface water systems are also good candidates for wastewater reuse indeed the nation of japan with the lack of natural water bodies and retention of rainfall is a big proponent of wastewater reuse technologies dayanthi et al 2006 the state of florida is also characterized with similar difficulties in that approximately half of all rainfall occurs within a four month period in the state with droughts often occurring during the balance of the remaining eight months martinez and clark 2015 unlike traditional wastewater discharges into surface streams where most of the water fails to replenish the aquifer wastewater irrigation is advantageous in such regions in that groundwater can function in a nearly closed loop with the only water loss occurring through evapotranspiration wastewater irrigation in addition to the contribution to the groundwater recharge also augments the base flow into the underlying streamflow a multitude of factors must be considered in terms of water resources in developed areas in the united states there is no clear archive of the percentage of wastewater that is reused between both municipal and industrial supplies usepa 2012 as of 2006 approximately 7 8 of the united states municipal wastewater was reclaimed although there are no determinant amounts for industrial use miller 2006 usepa 2012 in particular areas of the world however wastewater effluent is reused for either deep well injection or land application an example of which is in los angeles california specifically in the orange county groundwater basin there wastewater effluent is used as a seawater barrier and aquifer recharge via injection wells herndon and markus 2014 groundwater recharge in this orange county groundwater basin both meets and exceeds groundwater withdrawals from the regional aquifer and is similarly cost effective as opposed to importing water to the region thus indicating the economic viability of wastewater effluent reuse many methods are available to apply wastewater to the surface either through wetlands overland flow slow infiltration or through fast infiltration usepa 2004 natural fractures can be arranged in different spatial patterns correa et al 2022 gillespie et al 1993 determining what fracture patterns exist in the subsurface is obviously an important challenge in a situation where the flow of groundwater and wastewater in the surface subsurface system can influence the efficacy and sustainability of mitigation procedures and best management practices in the reuse of wastewater in agriculture but even where some fractures make topographic expressions as in this case the problems of discovering the location orientation size and connectivity of fractures is severe data and information on the organization of the fracture patterns remain a challenge even with the development of novel detection methods such as remote and drone based remote sensing and imaging wustefeld et al 2018 the use of advanced statistical and physical modeling methods correa et al 2022 zhu et al 2022 and the extensive application of drilling and well testing and analysis efforts gale et al 2018 therefore there is a need to develop a workflow for correlating depressions and discovering likely fractures in agricultural and forestry areas photogrammetry first used to capture lineaments in the nittany valley of central pennsylvania revealed changes in vegetation surface color and water retention in a straight line pattern lattman and parizek 1964 linear topographic features or lineaments are commonly the geomorphic expression of opening mode fractures joints or faults either singly or in zones o leary et al 1976 lineaments were identified in this study area and those less than 2 km long were inferred to be the topographic expression of fractures and faults lattman and nickelsen 1958 for the sake of this study lineaments are inferred to manifest in relation to possible extension of bedrock fractures however further study is necessary to definitively determine that these lineaments are indeed the results of large scale fractures historical pictures of the living filter dating back several decades show the presence of several lineaments and depressions fig s2 lattman and parizek 1964 first noted a reduction in the transmissivity of the gatesburg formation either along single lineaments or off lineaments in comparison to intersecting lineaments the critical nature of wastewater reuse in terms of the recharging of both aquifers and base flow to streams and to ensure sustainable agriculture particularly in terms of the living filter is of use in addressing the following two scientific questions first does the addition of on average 1 5 mgd of wastewater through irrigation on the living filter result in the increase of fracture apertures through suffusion and any mass wasting through the enlarged fractures via subsidence second do the fracture traces that indicate regions of greater weathering and permeability represent the likely occurrence of closed hillslope depressions here we show that a workflow based on gis can be developed for 1 detecting closed hillslope depressions and analyzing their spatial distributions and morphometric dynamics as well as for discovering likely fractures in agricultural and forest landscapes and 2 determining the correlations between the location of the lineaments fracture traces and the formation of closed hillslope depressions in the cropped and forested portions of the living filter we also show that the types of land use agricultural cropped and forest lands have an impact on the morphometric dynamics areal changes and cross section profiles of the closed hillslope depressions as a result of wastewater irrigation we first delineated the location and orientation of fracture traces within the mines dolomite and then developed a suitable workflow to identify those closed hillslope depressions in both the cropped and forested portions of the living filter specifically we designed two workflows in gis for this study the first gis workflow entailed delineating the location and orientations of fracture traces within the mines dolomite in order to determine any possible correlations between the location of fracture traces and the formation of depressions the second gis workflow entailed identifying the closed hillslope depressions located within the cropped and forested portions of the living filter to monitor their morphologic dynamics changes over time under wastewater irrigation the results of this study will aid in the understanding of the occurrence spatial distribution and morphologic dynamics of depressions in both crop fields and forests over time in a wastewater spray irrigated karst landscape with bedrock fractures these results will also permit an evaluation of the long term effects of wastewater reuse irrigation on soil in complex geologic and hydrologic systems thus demonstrating the beneficial purpose for use in water resources management water conservation and sustainable agriculture 2 materials and methods 2 1 the living filter a wastewater reuse spray irrigation system pennsylvania state university has been operating a secondarily treated wastewater irrigated forested and agricultural site known as the living filter in state college pa in some capacity since 1962 fig s1 the living filter is divided into two parcels of differing dimensions with the astronomy site encompassing roughly 191 ha and the game lands site encompassing 517 ha prior to 1960 wastewater from the borough of state college and the pennsylvania state university was discharged directly into spring creek parizek et al 1967 to mitigate this pollution the university chose to adopt the practice of wastewater spray irrigation but the growth of the school and surrounding environs placed spring creek under increased environmental stress which was characterized by high concentrations of nitrate that caused a large fish kill due to eutrophication parizek et al 1967 as spring creek is known as one of the state s premier trout streams in the spring of 1960 the pennsylvania department of environmental protection issued a cease and desist order to the wastewater treatment authority and thus the living filter was conceptualized and implemented in 1962 the living filter has been continuously in operation in some capacity since 1962 and was expanded in 1983 to its present size one concern regarding the position of the site location of the living filter is that state college pa is located in a seasonably cold climate with soil frost depths estimated to average 10 15 in and which is characterized by depths as far as 2 feet the wastewater effluent is applied year round at an average rate of 1 5 mgd even during the months of december march where average low temperatures are below freezing which results in a drastically altered infiltration scheme although localized overland flow has occurred onsite in the past it has never been observed to flow off site with ponding typically occurring in closed hillslope depressions while wastewater reuse is a scheme used in cold climates such as canada northern china and the northeastern united states spray irrigation is not the preferred method griffin and mancl 2017 rozema et al 2016 indeed in several study sites shallow wetlands are used to help denitrify groundwater runoff and ensure a focused recharge although several natural and man made wetlands are within the living filter a rather significant area is required to ensure a proper period of both storage and retention the natural wetlands that are within the game lands portion of the living filter are a result of both the differential weathering within the bedrock and enhanced infiltration from tear faults o driscoll and parizek 2003 a study on the impact of wastewater effluent in chain wetlands found nitrate removal efficiencies in excess of 92 compared to a 34 rate of removal efficiency in a non chain wetland which contribute to elevated nitrate levels within the living filter nemitz 2001 as of this writing the ranges of nitrate as nitrogen no3 n concentrations are between 1 and 8 ppm in a variety of wells underneath the astronomy site several investigations have been undertaken to elucidate the possibility of altered soil properties within the astronomy site as a result of wastewater irrigation the bulk densities of soil were determined to vary based on the proximity to both the sprinkler heads and the contours of the landscape larson 2010 walker and lin 2008 a reduced clay content was prevalent within the upper 20 cm of the soil surface within 16 m of sprinkler heads which was likely due to the translocation of the clay further a higher hydraulic conductivity was observed within the depressions although it is unknown if this increased conductivity was a result of the preferential pathways or some other mechanism dadio 1998 walker and lin 2008 soil crop cover is a significant factor upon the amount of erosion that occurs due to the ability of plants to prevent transport and weathering through their protection of the soil from splash erosion and through plant roots that ensure the uptake of water and the binding of soil crop cover in 2017 varied from wheat sorghum sudangrass corn and fescue depending on the plot location fig 1 agricultural products from the living filter are used as cattle feed for the university s dairy cows and are not intended for human consumption crops such as oranges in florida that utilize wastewater irrigation are used for human consumption however as no interaction of the effluent with the edible fruit occurs usepa 2012 although no significant study has been undertaken regarding the diversity of the trees and shrubs within the forest a study of the nearby game lands section of the living filter from 1997 to 2002 found that the irrigated forest had 200 overstory stems less per hectare than the non irrigated forest at a population of 336 kelso and bowersox 2005 the sapling density was affected even more within the irrigated site yielding 1008 saplings per hectare compared to 2789 stems per hectare within the non irrigated control plot further the biodiversity between trees shrubs and saplings was also significantly smaller within the irrigated site than that of the non irrigated site the irrigated site did yield a higher coverage rate of herbaceous growth compared to the non irrigated site it is likely that the increased herbaceous coverage is a result of ice formation on trees and saplings during the winter preventing growth and downing larger trees due to the excess weight of the ice herbaceous plants are seasonal and do not respond to the negative effects of ice accumulation as they are dormant during the winter also herbaceous plants have been found to have increased yield when irrigated with treated wastewater compared to non irrigated plants caldwell et al 2007 wastewater effluent properties have varied throughout time within the living filter as a result of new technologies population changes and environmental concerns in the early 1990 s nitrate within groundwater monitoring wells in and around the site exceeded the maximum contaminant levels mcls that were set at 10 ppm currently an activated sludge biological nitrogen removal process is employed at the wastewater treatment facility to reduce the nitrate in the effluent further the values of the c n ratio of 0 04 0 2 with a near neutral ph and nitrate concentrations of approximately 10 ppm have been reported in the effluent from the wastewater treatment facility sendagi and elliott 2017 indeed the monthly averages can vary significantly due to the number of students on campus since 2015 the borough of state college has operated on a separate wastewater treatment system with greywater reuse slated to begin within the next several years along with wastewater treatment plant upgrades to reduce the amount of nitrate and volumetric flow received into the living filter since 1982 the range of the total nitrogen in the effluent from the wastewater treatment plant has varied from levels between 2 and 56 ppm to levels at approximately 10 ppm following the implementation of activated sludge process in 1999 the pennsylvania state university is currently in the process of retrofitting its campus to support greywater reuse for local irrigation projects in both its athletic fields and community gardens greywater is expected to take away up to 0 5 mgd per day of wastewater from the living filter in the immediate future with the possibility of expanded use in the future this greywater utilized in toilets will eventually reflow again to the wastewater treatment plant so not all of the 0 5 mgd will be completely lost to the plant although any greywater used for irrigation will be eventually recharge the campus aquifer a distance of three miles from the living filter further although current wastewater treatment renovations are underway neither a final design nor a series of set treatment targets have been established as of july 2019 that is external to the university in terms of securing a class a high quality wastewater certification 2 2 hydrology of spring creek watershed the monitoring of groundwater wells for this research indicated that the recharge via the living filter was on average 2 8 mgd recharge from precipitation was established through a hydrograph analysis of bald eagle creek located to the north of the living filter site and is validated with values obtained from previous studies chin 1996 fulton et al 2015 fig 2 the basin wide average recharge was estimated using a streamflow hydrograph and a basin recharge analysis mau and winter 1997 the analysis completed in this study considers recharge based on precipitation and stream gauge from april 2007 to march 2018 precipitation data was acquired from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa for the city of state college pa the stream gauge data was retrieved from the usgs station 01547100 on spring creek located just beyond the confluence of spring creek with buffalo run thus providing an accurate representation of the basin wide recharge the hydrograph analysis was applied to derive a recharge rate of 0 88 ft year 10 5 in year which is comparable to the 10 in year recharge rate utilized by chin 1996 the potential evapotranspiration pet rate assessed through the hydrograph analysis was 2 39 ft year the evapotranspiration et rate calculated via the thornthwaite equation was 2 18 ft year and the previous et rate computed by means of the modified thornthwaite 1948 approach was 2 13 ft year thornthwaite 1948 waltman et al 1997 fig 3 2 3 geology setting and soils the astronomy site of the living filter is underlain by the mines member a largely uniform and massive coarse grained highly bedded dolomite with intermittent sandstone and quartzite layers table 1 excluding a small portion of the forested area which is underlain by the upper sandy member the mines member is the top geologic unit of the upper cambrian aged gatesburg formation and has a variable thickness of 150 230 feet caruccio 1963 further most of the swales and ridges that occur in centre county are within the common chert bedding that characterizes this mines member fig s3 the geology of the valley and ridge province is predominantly a result of the alleghenian orogeny and typically exhibits a ne sw strike the regional structure of the allegheny front trends at 52 in this area and is evident in the orientation of the surrounding orthoquartzite ridges matzke 1961 in the area of the living filter primary fracture traces exhibit a striking variance from 355 northwest to 15 northeast with secondary fractures at a near perpendicular strike the fractures and joints in the bedrock of the nittany valley are often inferred via swales ridges and localized depressions caruccio 1963 the preferential flow of infiltrating water into the aquifer system from such fractures results in a high infiltration rate that causes a subsidence of the land surface through the fracture zones with a depressed surface extant the factor of dissolution of the carbonate rocks within the region can also result in the formation of depressions while outcrops of the mines member are absent within the living filter several outcrops are present near the site with voids of 1 2 feet present as derived from the visible mines outcrops solution landon 1963 further both vugs and microfractures in great numbers characterize this area with large surface area causing the regular occurrence of dissolution the presence of vugs in bedrock also affects the storage coefficient i e storativity in that a solid and unfractured dolomite has a low storativity and porosity unlike vuggy and fractured dolomite that significantly increases both of these parameters van de reep 2009 unlike the mines member the upper sandy member is a more granular dolomite with a high occurrence of quartzite and sandstone layers the latter of which are known to dissolve and contribute to the large voids full of flowing sand lattman and parizek 1964 closed hillslope depressions are defined depressions within the immediate location of the living filter dadio 1998 in areas where carbonate bedrock comprises the bulk of the geology the formation of sinkholes and other karstic features are common central pennsylvania is known for its formation of cover collapse and cover subsidence sinkholes although these features have a higher likelihood to form in limestone than dolomite in a closed depression system hillslopes drain to a depression in which water accumulates and eroded sediments are deposited norton 1986 closed hillslope depressions are considered an intermediate stage of hillslope subsidence in which depressions are filled with transported material at a rate near equal to the rate of the subsidence a manifestation corroborated by walker and lin 2008 also the depth of the soil a horizon within the depressions is significantly thicker than that of the slope summits depressions also present areas for the occurrence of a focused recharge due to their position within the hillslope allowing for flow accumulation although no storage calculations were performed on the depressions within the site it is common for several depressions to retain water or remain heavily saturated year round dadio 1998 determined that a low permeability soil crust forms within the depressions at the living filter which is the likely result of increased clay content and colloids within the wastewater effluent fig 4 soils in the astronomy site are characterized as anywhere between a silt loam and a silty clay loam with varying degrees of slope angles braker 1981 the study site is dominated by hagerstown silt loam and hagerstown silty clay loam with a partial mapping of the hublersburg series in the same area braker 1981 although the hublersburg series has been mapped within the study site walker and lin 2008 noted the absence of a hublersburg series due to the absence of rock fragments within the soil the hagerstown series consists of soils that are known to fine downward with an increased clay content at depth andrews et al 2016 both the hublersburg series and the hagerstown series are soils derived from the decomposition of limestone and dolomite although the depth of the overburden soil within the astronomy site varies the average depth of the soil throughout the mines member is 43 feet compared to 87 feet of soil overlaying the upper sandy member caruccio 1963 the overburden sediment above the mines dolomite is almost assuredly solely from the decomposition of the mines dolomite due to the high occurrence of both oolitic cherts and a high clay content as the soil composing the mines member is of a finer texture than the coarse soil of the upper sandy member caruccio 1963 estimated that the thickness of the regolith above the upper sandy member should be at least twice as much of that the regolith above the mines member based on the 15 orthoquartzite content in the upper sandy member 2 4 fracture trace and depression location methods the evolution of geospatial technologies has made it possible to use a variety of data processing tools to verify the visual cues of depressions and fracture traces and to detect asymptomatic fractures and depressions the availability of high resolution digital terrain models dtm has become more abundant in recent years with data now available for the astronomy site from the years 2007 and 2017 the resolution of the dtm s from 2007 and 2017 used for this study are 2 2 ft which is a high enough resolution to determine areal extent although it has a tendency to smooth some vertical features at this resolution the dtm from 2007 is derived from orthoimages while the dtm from 2017 is derived from lidar both dtm s use the pennsylvania state plane north fips 3701 nad 83 datum that are in units of feet a higher resolution lidar is recommended however for a more in depth analysis for volume change within depressions 2 4 1 methods of fracture delineation as a variance characterizes the fracture trace orientations in this strike area from n5w to n5e based on the bedrock exposures matzke 1961 the downslope faces of the fracture traces should be illuminated when a hillshade map is created perpendicularly to the strike the lineations which were within the living filter specifically were measured between 3 and 15 ne served as the baseline orientations for the fracture trace identification process a manual process was then created for the identification of fracture traces using arcgis 10 6 1 the outline and design of which is in fig s4 in order to determine the position of fracture traces in the area of the astronomy site the hillshade tool within the surface toolset was used to construct a map with an azimuth of 282 and an altitude of 45 interpreted as sun shining from 282 with a 45 sun angle the aspect tool located in the surface toolset was next used for the identification of fracture traces isolated by the hillshade map to determine the direction of each cell within the dtm the aspect of the cell is perpendicular to the strike of the cell like that of both the strike and dip in the structural geology all cells with an aspect of between 273 and 285 degrees were extracted from the data at which point the raster to polygon tool in the conversion toolset was used for their conversion to polygons fig 5a in order to determine the validation of the fracture trace locations based on aspect orientation the cell aspects were isolated in groups of 12 0 12 12 24 24 36 36 48 48 60 60 72 72 84 84 96 96 108 108 120 120 132 132 144 144 156 156 168 168 180 degrees figs s5 s19 once the polygons were created the majority filter tool located in the generalization toolset was used to remove polygons without five of the eight surrounding pixels of the same value once the majority filter was complete the boundary clean tool within the generalization toolset was set to descend to ensure a merging of the larger area polygons with the smaller thus making the fracture traces easier to identify finally a polyline layer and the editor toolbar was used to create the manually drawn fracture traces and the zonal geometry as table tool located in the zonal toolset was used to determine the fracture orientations the length and width of fractures were not recorded for this study as the fractures often extended off site and out of the scope of our research area fig 5b in order to ensure the accuracy of the results a control site was established for the game lands site the same fracture analysis as outlined above was conducted on both the forested and unforested sections of the game lands site in order to statistically validate the efficacy of these methods in identifying fractures of similar orientations fig s20 the fracture traces from the astronomy site and the game lands site were then statistically analyzed a two sample t test of unequal variance between the two sets of measured fractures with an alpha of 0 025 was used to assess if the fractures have the same orientation 2 4 2 methods of closed hillslope depression identification an adapted automated difference process for depression identification as shown in fig s21 was next used to determine the location of depressions within the astronomy site doctor and young 2013 jeanpert et al 2016 using the fill tool located in the hydrology toolset the depressions in the land were determined by isolating those cells that were lower than the surrounding counterparts at which point they were filled to their pour point and the elevation raster smoothed after creation the fill raster was subtracted from the original dtm using the raster calculator tool located in the map algebra toolset to isolate areas of depression using the reclass tool located in the reclassify toolset all depressions deeper than three inches were reclassified to a value of 1 and depressions less than three inches were classified as no data in order to de noise the data fig 6a the select by attributes tool was used to select only those depressions within 50 feet of a lineament and more than five feet away from unpaved roads given that lineaments in this area typically average 50 feet in width this number was used to reduce error from the created thin polylines all depressions with an area larger than 10 ft2 and five feet of the unpaved roads in this area which are composed a fine grain gravel were selected and exported to create a new dataset the purpose of this selection was to prevent any skewing of the results of the depression formation from the high hydraulic conductivity and from the depressions within five feet of those roads which are characterized by a flat edge that parallels them the presence of burrows and other smaller natural features necessitated using an area above 10 ft2 to further reduce the noise in the data zonal geometry was used to tabulate the orientation of the depressions for statistical comparisons between the years 2007 and 2017 fig 6b in order to analyze the change in areal extent the previously described processes were performed upon dtm s from years 2007 and 2017 all selected depressions were then exported into a separate layer the polygon to raster tool in the conversion toolset was then used to reconvert the data into raster data that was then reclassified as 1 for depressions from the year 2007 and 2 for depressions from the year 2017 in order to symbolize areal progression the raster calculator tool located in the map algebra toolset was used to create a raster calculation to combine both rasters the values of 3 indicated the presence of depressions in both the years 2007 and 2017 the values of 1 indicated their presence in only 2007 and values of 2 indicated their presence in only 2017 fig 7 cross sections were created along the center line of six depressions three in the cropped area and three in the forested area the profile graph tool in the 3d analyst toolbar was used to create these cross sections for the 2007 and 2017 depression areas via interpolation of a line along the cross section depressions were analyzed for both sites to consider the occurrence of various erosional processes and the potential ecological impacts of various plant life growth fig 8 the orientation of the depression in both the forested and cropped sites of the astronomy site were then statistically analyzed a two sample t test assuming unequal variances was conducted on the orientation of the depressions in both the forested and cropped sites between the years 2007 and 2017 using an alpha of 0 025 to assess if the orientations of the depressions were similar to principle orientation 3 results 3 1 fractures zonal geometry was used to trace and compare a series of fracture traces within the astronomy site for comparison with the established results of matzke 1961 and parizek et al 1967 the data in the resulting frequency graph of all determined ne sw fractures was near identical to that developed by matzke in 1961 table 2 also photographs from the 1940 s 1980 s 1990 s and early 2000 s indicated the presence of visible fracture traces as evidenced by lack of vegetation and straight surface ponding areas 3 2 depressions elongations of three depressions along a single fracture in the same direction as the original fracture trace were also observed an analysis of the areal progression from 2007 and 2017 indicated a net positive change in area with a propagation of the area of the depressions down the hillslope and that were filled in up slope a net positive area change of all depressions located within 50 feet of the fracture trace centers and more than five feet from all unpaved roads indicated a progression of nearly 8000 ft2 of these depressions during the period from 2007 to 2017 figs 9 11 finally although the cross sections of the selected depressions during the 2007 2017 period in the cropped and forested sites indicated variations in morphology none was observed in both depth and height figs 10 and 11 4 discussion the results of a slope aspect identification approach which is appropriate for datasets with a fracture area width that is greater than the individual cell size clearly elucidates the linear features in the area of the astronomy site the dtm that was used for slope aspect identification has a resolution of 2 2 feet unlike the swales and depressions in the area that have been known to exceed 50 feet in width matzke 1961 the results of the fracture traces from table 2 are corroborated by matzke s findings in the region of the pennsylvania furnace anticline no significant lineations or depressions were identified despite a separate analysis to determine the presence of perpendicular fractures in the area matzke 1961 referred to the perpendicular e w fractures as secondary in nature and less developed than those trending n s the regional geology of centre county pa and the orthoquartzite ridges that surround the astronomy site are oriented at 52 ne which is a divergent angle from the two dominant fractures matzke 1961 speculated that fractures in this area are the result of some regional event because they occur on both the hanging and foot walls of thrust faults in this area local joint patterns occur 45 off axis from the dominant fracture trace direction and contradict the original postulation of lattman and nickelsen 1958 that fractures and joints are near perpendicular in this area fig 12 the fracture rose diagram results from this research north of the pennsylvania furnace anticline and south of the marengo syncline closely match those of matzke 1961 fig 12 the limitations of the manual correlation from the slope aspect map however prevented an accurate characterization of both the density and numbers of fractures within the study area a higher number of fractures are evident however when using the fracture maps of parizek et al 1967 and lattman and parizek 1964 for comparison using a photogrammetric approach parizek et al 1967 and lattman and parizek 1964 mapped fractures based on their surficial manifestations as linear features with discernable change in color vegetation and standing water in order to avoid any sort of manual bias when mapping the fracture traces the development of an automatic script could possibly reduce error in these regards when looking at all the identified depressions regardless of their proximity to either roads or fractures results of the underlying hillshade map clearly indicate the presence of several elliptical features that have not been identified by the fill tool in that the fill tool operates by creating a pour point of the lowest elevation the manifestation of a non detect error in the tool is possible when depressions are located on steeper hillslopes if a pour point spills over prematurely given its location upon a slope it will not collect water of enough depth for identification and is thus eliminated during the de noising process the elongation of depressions in the direction of the fracture may also obscure the detection of depressions in that they fail to create a fully enclosed ellipsoid shape indeed some of these non ellipsoid shapes may well be what caruccio 1963 characterized as swales within the mines member the fracture traces from the astronomy site and the game lands site were then statistically analyzed a two sample t test of unequal variance between the two sets of measured fractures with an alpha of 0 025 corresponding to two standard deviations yields a null hypothesis that the fractures have the same orientation a skewing of the data in one direction or another from human error is possible however in that these fractures were drawn by hand table s1 it is unknown the extent to which the land upon which the astronomy site currently occupies has been used for agricultural purposes but such was the case prior to the inception of the site in 1962 historical photos also show that much of the now forested site was clear cut and cropped as far back as 1938 the continued use of the cropped portion of the living filter for agricultural purposes could potentially influence the extent of the depressions due to the lessened interception of precipitation and irrigation overland flow was an issue within the cropped area prior to the construction of a wetland area and drainage pipes at the bottom of the upper hillslope the lack of interception can be correlated to a higher rate of erosion thus depositing more fill material within the depressions and increasing the ap horizon depth as shown in walker and lin 2008 the living filter was also tilled until the mid 1990 s meaning that there were at least 35 years where the depressions could have been smoothed by tillage a depression change analysis was ran on the non university owned parcel northeast of the study site were tillage is suspected to still occur and there are significantly fewer identifiable depression features the lessening of the depressions within the cropped site is corroborated by the fact that the area of the depressions detected within the cropped site has been reduced by over 5000 ft2 since 2007 within the forested site the opposite of that which is occurring within the cropped site seems to correspond to an increase of 13 000 ft2 of the areal extent of depressions these findings are similar to that of a study in central belgium of closed depressions both within forested and cropped sites that were remnants of anthropogenic mining practices gillijns et al 2005 gillijns et al 2005 found that depressions within the cropped area had a wider areal extent shallower depth and a gentler relief due to the effects of tillage splash erosion and inter rill rill erosion whereas the depressions within the forested site were characterized by a steeper relief due to the protection and interception of the forest canopy cross sections taken in arcgis of these multiple depressions both in the cropped site and in the forested site do not reflect significant change in the depth of the depressions along the cross sectional line although the morphology of the depressions has varied within the past 10 years as evidenced by the cross sections the findings from the cross sections once again confirm gillijn s analysis of the depression shapes they noted that the depressions within the cropped land had infilled and created a v shaped cross section while the depressions within the forested site had preserved their original u shaped cross sections these classifications between both the v shaped and u shaped depressions are defined as bowl v shaped and saucer u shaped depressions kołodyńska gawrysiak and chabudziński 2014 a mean orientation of 10 ne and of 358 nw characterized the respective depressions within the forested and cropped sites which further indicated large variations in their standard deviations which were 31 and 43 of both sites respectively the irregularity of the orientation and shapes of the depressions indicates the possible manifestations of the secondary fracture traces that skews the shape of the depressions with the assumed substantive transmissivity of the intersecting fractures it is possible that depressions not oriented along the primary fracture trace occur above secondary fractures the same could be true of intercepting joint patterns a two sample t test assuming unequal variances was conducted on the orientation of the depressions in both the forested and cropped sites between the years 2007 and 2017 using an alpha of 0 025 and a null hypothesis of the orientations of the depressions were similar to principle orientation we accepted such a hypothesis for the 2007 and 2017 depressions identified for both the forested and the cropped sites tables s2 and s3 using those same parameters and same null hypothesis we also accepted the null hypothesis when comparing the cropped site to the forested site tables s4 and s5 the lack of ground control points for the 2007 orthorectified dtm and the 2017 orthorectified dtm makes it impossible to determine the accuracy of the elevation from both models a traditional rule of thumb is that the error of the model should be less than 2 pixels 4 feet devos and kay 2005 as such given the level of accuracy needed for a full vertical comparison of the depressions the resolution of our datasets was not suitable therefore subsequent research is recommended in order to account for any errors in the depression isolation for those depressions located in areas of steep relief due to the inability of the fill tool to recognize these areas as pour points further the limitations of the depression isolation to features that are enclosed enough to form a pour point prevents its use in identifying depressions with either a lowered edge or an incomplete elliptical shape the possibility of intercepting joints and fractures must also be considered for the orientation distribution of depressions expanding the dataset to include a larger study area would likely rectify the mean orientation and standard deviation with an expanded inventory of depressions coring geochemical analysis like that of norton 1986 should also be explored in order to determine the depth and age of transported sediment within the depressions a secondary area of future study may entail the combination of both the gis technique outlined here with traditional photogrammetry practices along with advanced photogrammetry practices such a premise is possible given the availability of high resolution images detailing this area over multiple time periods particularly the years 2007 2012 2015 and 2017 it is also possible to implement and combine a workflow that is similar to that developed by pokharel 2007 siart et al 2009 and kakavas et al 2015 to more thoroughly elucidate fracture trace locations in areas that are characterized by skewed slope face orientation caused by the position of the landscape kakavas et al 2015 pokharel 2007 siart et al 2009 in addition our gis based workflow may be coupled with seismic techniques to determine the location network and evolution of fractures the coupling of our gis based workflow with seismological techniques using p waves or s waves pyraknolte et al 1990a b ukar et al 2020 would allow high spatial and temporal resolutions of the characterization of fractures a third area of future research may entail the integration of point process statistics to the gis based workflow that we developed for analyzing the spatial distribution of closed hillslope depressions and spatial arrangement of fractures in two dimensions a two dimensional spatial analysis of closed hillslope depressions and fractures using point process statistics bonneau and stoyan 2022 correa et al 2022 stoyan and penttinen 2000 would further our understanding on the arrangement patterns e g random clustered and regular of these landforms that configurate the landscape as well as identified preferential arrangement patterns 5 conclusion this study identified and related any bedrock fracture traces and surface depressions to surficial or geomorphologic processes currently underway at the site of the living filter the previous measurements of fracture traces in this area undertaken by matzke 1961 lattman and parizek 1964 and parizek et al 1967 yielded results in a near n s orientation the use of a manual process to estimate the primary fracture trace angles yielded results nearly identical to that of the aforementioned authors a high occurrence of depressions was noted in the area of fractures compared to non fractured bedrock in the areal extent we observed a dissipation of depressions within the cropped site and a growth in the depressions in the forested site the depressions in the living filter were found to have a net gain of 8000 ft2 the result of which was from the net loss of 5000 ft2 within the agricultural portion of the site and a net gain of 13 000 ft2 within the forested portion of the site cross sections of several depressions within cropped areas indicated a lower angle slope corresponding to a v shape while depressions within forested areas were characterized by a traditional u shape and previously established steeper slope these findings will enhance the current understanding of the different morphologic characteristics of both forested and agricultural depressions in karst topography the workflows implemented here can be implemented in similar sites that display topographical variances from the bedrock fractures however further study of the transport of sediments within both land regimes is needed to fully characterize the extent to which these depressions are changing in terms of horizontal and vertical behavior funding this

9055,the living filter at pennsylvania state university in central pennsylvania receives on average 1 5 million gallons per day mgd of secondary treated wastewater effluent year round since 1962 the objective of this study was to identify and relate any bedrock fracture traces and surface depressions to any surficial or geomorphologic processes currently underway as a result of irrigation the living filter is underlain by a massive dolomite with fractures trending near n s that were previously documented using photogrammetry a manual process was developed in order to determine the trend and location of several fracture traces within the astronomy site section of the living filter a semi automated isolation scheme was next used to identify and correlate closed depressions to the location of fracture traces in the living filter a predominant but slight ne sw trend was observed among fractures at n5e in the area north of the pennsylvania furnace anticline a high occurrence of depressions was noted in the area of fractures compared to non fractured bedrock the depressions in this area were found to have a net gain of 8000 ft2 the result of which was from the net loss of 5000 ft2 within the agricultural portion of the site and a net gain of 13 000 ft2 within the forested portion of the site cross sections of several depressions within cropped areas indicated a lower angle slope corresponding to a v shape while depressions within forested areas were characterized by a traditional u shape and previously established steeper slope these findings will enhance the current understanding of the different morphologic characteristics of both forested and agricultural depressions in karst topography the workflows implemented here can be implemented in similar sites that display topographical variances from the bedrock fractures keywords closed hillslope depression fracture lineament wastewater reuse irrigation karst system data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction knowledge of fractures and their patterns and networks in rock is essential for scientific technological and economic purposes analysis and interpretation of rock fractures and their patterns and networks are critical to understand earth science processes and to engineer and manage surface and subsurface systems laubach et al 2019 fractures are defined as mechanical breaks in rocks involving discontinuities in displacement across surfaces or narrow zones national research council 1996 fractures are key elements of the geological processes that influence pathways rates and heterogeneities of fluid flow and redistribution as well as rock strength and connectivity between surface and subsurface environments bear et al 1993 berkowitz 2002 de dreuzy et al 2012 wang 1991 wang et al 2022 therefore fractures serve as pathways for flow phenomena and transport processes occurring in systems such as groundwater and aquifers as well as hydrocarbon reservoirs and impacting the fate and transport of contaminants national research council 1996 fractures may influence surface processes such as the surface depressions that frequently occur with underground fracture zones understanding the impact of fractures their patterns and networks on the surface processes is important for water resources engineering and management particularly in the case of long term application of wastewater reuse irrigation in agriculture such as the living filter in state college pa which is a secondary treated wastewater irrigated forested and agricultural site in a karst landscape in the nittany valley of central pennsylvania fig s1 both the underlying geology and the depth of the unconfined aquifer must be considered when determining the placement of a wastewater irrigation site ensuring the efficacy of wastewater irrigation requires soil that is adequately permeable to ensure the infiltration of wastewater and which is also characterized by adequate periods for both denitrification and retention although wastewater reuse concepts are mostly used in predominantly arid and semi arid climates such as the middle east and north africa mena some parts of europe and the western united states hamilton et al 2007 regions that are characterized by delicate surface water systems are also good candidates for wastewater reuse indeed the nation of japan with the lack of natural water bodies and retention of rainfall is a big proponent of wastewater reuse technologies dayanthi et al 2006 the state of florida is also characterized with similar difficulties in that approximately half of all rainfall occurs within a four month period in the state with droughts often occurring during the balance of the remaining eight months martinez and clark 2015 unlike traditional wastewater discharges into surface streams where most of the water fails to replenish the aquifer wastewater irrigation is advantageous in such regions in that groundwater can function in a nearly closed loop with the only water loss occurring through evapotranspiration wastewater irrigation in addition to the contribution to the groundwater recharge also augments the base flow into the underlying streamflow a multitude of factors must be considered in terms of water resources in developed areas in the united states there is no clear archive of the percentage of wastewater that is reused between both municipal and industrial supplies usepa 2012 as of 2006 approximately 7 8 of the united states municipal wastewater was reclaimed although there are no determinant amounts for industrial use miller 2006 usepa 2012 in particular areas of the world however wastewater effluent is reused for either deep well injection or land application an example of which is in los angeles california specifically in the orange county groundwater basin there wastewater effluent is used as a seawater barrier and aquifer recharge via injection wells herndon and markus 2014 groundwater recharge in this orange county groundwater basin both meets and exceeds groundwater withdrawals from the regional aquifer and is similarly cost effective as opposed to importing water to the region thus indicating the economic viability of wastewater effluent reuse many methods are available to apply wastewater to the surface either through wetlands overland flow slow infiltration or through fast infiltration usepa 2004 natural fractures can be arranged in different spatial patterns correa et al 2022 gillespie et al 1993 determining what fracture patterns exist in the subsurface is obviously an important challenge in a situation where the flow of groundwater and wastewater in the surface subsurface system can influence the efficacy and sustainability of mitigation procedures and best management practices in the reuse of wastewater in agriculture but even where some fractures make topographic expressions as in this case the problems of discovering the location orientation size and connectivity of fractures is severe data and information on the organization of the fracture patterns remain a challenge even with the development of novel detection methods such as remote and drone based remote sensing and imaging wustefeld et al 2018 the use of advanced statistical and physical modeling methods correa et al 2022 zhu et al 2022 and the extensive application of drilling and well testing and analysis efforts gale et al 2018 therefore there is a need to develop a workflow for correlating depressions and discovering likely fractures in agricultural and forestry areas photogrammetry first used to capture lineaments in the nittany valley of central pennsylvania revealed changes in vegetation surface color and water retention in a straight line pattern lattman and parizek 1964 linear topographic features or lineaments are commonly the geomorphic expression of opening mode fractures joints or faults either singly or in zones o leary et al 1976 lineaments were identified in this study area and those less than 2 km long were inferred to be the topographic expression of fractures and faults lattman and nickelsen 1958 for the sake of this study lineaments are inferred to manifest in relation to possible extension of bedrock fractures however further study is necessary to definitively determine that these lineaments are indeed the results of large scale fractures historical pictures of the living filter dating back several decades show the presence of several lineaments and depressions fig s2 lattman and parizek 1964 first noted a reduction in the transmissivity of the gatesburg formation either along single lineaments or off lineaments in comparison to intersecting lineaments the critical nature of wastewater reuse in terms of the recharging of both aquifers and base flow to streams and to ensure sustainable agriculture particularly in terms of the living filter is of use in addressing the following two scientific questions first does the addition of on average 1 5 mgd of wastewater through irrigation on the living filter result in the increase of fracture apertures through suffusion and any mass wasting through the enlarged fractures via subsidence second do the fracture traces that indicate regions of greater weathering and permeability represent the likely occurrence of closed hillslope depressions here we show that a workflow based on gis can be developed for 1 detecting closed hillslope depressions and analyzing their spatial distributions and morphometric dynamics as well as for discovering likely fractures in agricultural and forest landscapes and 2 determining the correlations between the location of the lineaments fracture traces and the formation of closed hillslope depressions in the cropped and forested portions of the living filter we also show that the types of land use agricultural cropped and forest lands have an impact on the morphometric dynamics areal changes and cross section profiles of the closed hillslope depressions as a result of wastewater irrigation we first delineated the location and orientation of fracture traces within the mines dolomite and then developed a suitable workflow to identify those closed hillslope depressions in both the cropped and forested portions of the living filter specifically we designed two workflows in gis for this study the first gis workflow entailed delineating the location and orientations of fracture traces within the mines dolomite in order to determine any possible correlations between the location of fracture traces and the formation of depressions the second gis workflow entailed identifying the closed hillslope depressions located within the cropped and forested portions of the living filter to monitor their morphologic dynamics changes over time under wastewater irrigation the results of this study will aid in the understanding of the occurrence spatial distribution and morphologic dynamics of depressions in both crop fields and forests over time in a wastewater spray irrigated karst landscape with bedrock fractures these results will also permit an evaluation of the long term effects of wastewater reuse irrigation on soil in complex geologic and hydrologic systems thus demonstrating the beneficial purpose for use in water resources management water conservation and sustainable agriculture 2 materials and methods 2 1 the living filter a wastewater reuse spray irrigation system pennsylvania state university has been operating a secondarily treated wastewater irrigated forested and agricultural site known as the living filter in state college pa in some capacity since 1962 fig s1 the living filter is divided into two parcels of differing dimensions with the astronomy site encompassing roughly 191 ha and the game lands site encompassing 517 ha prior to 1960 wastewater from the borough of state college and the pennsylvania state university was discharged directly into spring creek parizek et al 1967 to mitigate this pollution the university chose to adopt the practice of wastewater spray irrigation but the growth of the school and surrounding environs placed spring creek under increased environmental stress which was characterized by high concentrations of nitrate that caused a large fish kill due to eutrophication parizek et al 1967 as spring creek is known as one of the state s premier trout streams in the spring of 1960 the pennsylvania department of environmental protection issued a cease and desist order to the wastewater treatment authority and thus the living filter was conceptualized and implemented in 1962 the living filter has been continuously in operation in some capacity since 1962 and was expanded in 1983 to its present size one concern regarding the position of the site location of the living filter is that state college pa is located in a seasonably cold climate with soil frost depths estimated to average 10 15 in and which is characterized by depths as far as 2 feet the wastewater effluent is applied year round at an average rate of 1 5 mgd even during the months of december march where average low temperatures are below freezing which results in a drastically altered infiltration scheme although localized overland flow has occurred onsite in the past it has never been observed to flow off site with ponding typically occurring in closed hillslope depressions while wastewater reuse is a scheme used in cold climates such as canada northern china and the northeastern united states spray irrigation is not the preferred method griffin and mancl 2017 rozema et al 2016 indeed in several study sites shallow wetlands are used to help denitrify groundwater runoff and ensure a focused recharge although several natural and man made wetlands are within the living filter a rather significant area is required to ensure a proper period of both storage and retention the natural wetlands that are within the game lands portion of the living filter are a result of both the differential weathering within the bedrock and enhanced infiltration from tear faults o driscoll and parizek 2003 a study on the impact of wastewater effluent in chain wetlands found nitrate removal efficiencies in excess of 92 compared to a 34 rate of removal efficiency in a non chain wetland which contribute to elevated nitrate levels within the living filter nemitz 2001 as of this writing the ranges of nitrate as nitrogen no3 n concentrations are between 1 and 8 ppm in a variety of wells underneath the astronomy site several investigations have been undertaken to elucidate the possibility of altered soil properties within the astronomy site as a result of wastewater irrigation the bulk densities of soil were determined to vary based on the proximity to both the sprinkler heads and the contours of the landscape larson 2010 walker and lin 2008 a reduced clay content was prevalent within the upper 20 cm of the soil surface within 16 m of sprinkler heads which was likely due to the translocation of the clay further a higher hydraulic conductivity was observed within the depressions although it is unknown if this increased conductivity was a result of the preferential pathways or some other mechanism dadio 1998 walker and lin 2008 soil crop cover is a significant factor upon the amount of erosion that occurs due to the ability of plants to prevent transport and weathering through their protection of the soil from splash erosion and through plant roots that ensure the uptake of water and the binding of soil crop cover in 2017 varied from wheat sorghum sudangrass corn and fescue depending on the plot location fig 1 agricultural products from the living filter are used as cattle feed for the university s dairy cows and are not intended for human consumption crops such as oranges in florida that utilize wastewater irrigation are used for human consumption however as no interaction of the effluent with the edible fruit occurs usepa 2012 although no significant study has been undertaken regarding the diversity of the trees and shrubs within the forest a study of the nearby game lands section of the living filter from 1997 to 2002 found that the irrigated forest had 200 overstory stems less per hectare than the non irrigated forest at a population of 336 kelso and bowersox 2005 the sapling density was affected even more within the irrigated site yielding 1008 saplings per hectare compared to 2789 stems per hectare within the non irrigated control plot further the biodiversity between trees shrubs and saplings was also significantly smaller within the irrigated site than that of the non irrigated site the irrigated site did yield a higher coverage rate of herbaceous growth compared to the non irrigated site it is likely that the increased herbaceous coverage is a result of ice formation on trees and saplings during the winter preventing growth and downing larger trees due to the excess weight of the ice herbaceous plants are seasonal and do not respond to the negative effects of ice accumulation as they are dormant during the winter also herbaceous plants have been found to have increased yield when irrigated with treated wastewater compared to non irrigated plants caldwell et al 2007 wastewater effluent properties have varied throughout time within the living filter as a result of new technologies population changes and environmental concerns in the early 1990 s nitrate within groundwater monitoring wells in and around the site exceeded the maximum contaminant levels mcls that were set at 10 ppm currently an activated sludge biological nitrogen removal process is employed at the wastewater treatment facility to reduce the nitrate in the effluent further the values of the c n ratio of 0 04 0 2 with a near neutral ph and nitrate concentrations of approximately 10 ppm have been reported in the effluent from the wastewater treatment facility sendagi and elliott 2017 indeed the monthly averages can vary significantly due to the number of students on campus since 2015 the borough of state college has operated on a separate wastewater treatment system with greywater reuse slated to begin within the next several years along with wastewater treatment plant upgrades to reduce the amount of nitrate and volumetric flow received into the living filter since 1982 the range of the total nitrogen in the effluent from the wastewater treatment plant has varied from levels between 2 and 56 ppm to levels at approximately 10 ppm following the implementation of activated sludge process in 1999 the pennsylvania state university is currently in the process of retrofitting its campus to support greywater reuse for local irrigation projects in both its athletic fields and community gardens greywater is expected to take away up to 0 5 mgd per day of wastewater from the living filter in the immediate future with the possibility of expanded use in the future this greywater utilized in toilets will eventually reflow again to the wastewater treatment plant so not all of the 0 5 mgd will be completely lost to the plant although any greywater used for irrigation will be eventually recharge the campus aquifer a distance of three miles from the living filter further although current wastewater treatment renovations are underway neither a final design nor a series of set treatment targets have been established as of july 2019 that is external to the university in terms of securing a class a high quality wastewater certification 2 2 hydrology of spring creek watershed the monitoring of groundwater wells for this research indicated that the recharge via the living filter was on average 2 8 mgd recharge from precipitation was established through a hydrograph analysis of bald eagle creek located to the north of the living filter site and is validated with values obtained from previous studies chin 1996 fulton et al 2015 fig 2 the basin wide average recharge was estimated using a streamflow hydrograph and a basin recharge analysis mau and winter 1997 the analysis completed in this study considers recharge based on precipitation and stream gauge from april 2007 to march 2018 precipitation data was acquired from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa for the city of state college pa the stream gauge data was retrieved from the usgs station 01547100 on spring creek located just beyond the confluence of spring creek with buffalo run thus providing an accurate representation of the basin wide recharge the hydrograph analysis was applied to derive a recharge rate of 0 88 ft year 10 5 in year which is comparable to the 10 in year recharge rate utilized by chin 1996 the potential evapotranspiration pet rate assessed through the hydrograph analysis was 2 39 ft year the evapotranspiration et rate calculated via the thornthwaite equation was 2 18 ft year and the previous et rate computed by means of the modified thornthwaite 1948 approach was 2 13 ft year thornthwaite 1948 waltman et al 1997 fig 3 2 3 geology setting and soils the astronomy site of the living filter is underlain by the mines member a largely uniform and massive coarse grained highly bedded dolomite with intermittent sandstone and quartzite layers table 1 excluding a small portion of the forested area which is underlain by the upper sandy member the mines member is the top geologic unit of the upper cambrian aged gatesburg formation and has a variable thickness of 150 230 feet caruccio 1963 further most of the swales and ridges that occur in centre county are within the common chert bedding that characterizes this mines member fig s3 the geology of the valley and ridge province is predominantly a result of the alleghenian orogeny and typically exhibits a ne sw strike the regional structure of the allegheny front trends at 52 in this area and is evident in the orientation of the surrounding orthoquartzite ridges matzke 1961 in the area of the living filter primary fracture traces exhibit a striking variance from 355 northwest to 15 northeast with secondary fractures at a near perpendicular strike the fractures and joints in the bedrock of the nittany valley are often inferred via swales ridges and localized depressions caruccio 1963 the preferential flow of infiltrating water into the aquifer system from such fractures results in a high infiltration rate that causes a subsidence of the land surface through the fracture zones with a depressed surface extant the factor of dissolution of the carbonate rocks within the region can also result in the formation of depressions while outcrops of the mines member are absent within the living filter several outcrops are present near the site with voids of 1 2 feet present as derived from the visible mines outcrops solution landon 1963 further both vugs and microfractures in great numbers characterize this area with large surface area causing the regular occurrence of dissolution the presence of vugs in bedrock also affects the storage coefficient i e storativity in that a solid and unfractured dolomite has a low storativity and porosity unlike vuggy and fractured dolomite that significantly increases both of these parameters van de reep 2009 unlike the mines member the upper sandy member is a more granular dolomite with a high occurrence of quartzite and sandstone layers the latter of which are known to dissolve and contribute to the large voids full of flowing sand lattman and parizek 1964 closed hillslope depressions are defined depressions within the immediate location of the living filter dadio 1998 in areas where carbonate bedrock comprises the bulk of the geology the formation of sinkholes and other karstic features are common central pennsylvania is known for its formation of cover collapse and cover subsidence sinkholes although these features have a higher likelihood to form in limestone than dolomite in a closed depression system hillslopes drain to a depression in which water accumulates and eroded sediments are deposited norton 1986 closed hillslope depressions are considered an intermediate stage of hillslope subsidence in which depressions are filled with transported material at a rate near equal to the rate of the subsidence a manifestation corroborated by walker and lin 2008 also the depth of the soil a horizon within the depressions is significantly thicker than that of the slope summits depressions also present areas for the occurrence of a focused recharge due to their position within the hillslope allowing for flow accumulation although no storage calculations were performed on the depressions within the site it is common for several depressions to retain water or remain heavily saturated year round dadio 1998 determined that a low permeability soil crust forms within the depressions at the living filter which is the likely result of increased clay content and colloids within the wastewater effluent fig 4 soils in the astronomy site are characterized as anywhere between a silt loam and a silty clay loam with varying degrees of slope angles braker 1981 the study site is dominated by hagerstown silt loam and hagerstown silty clay loam with a partial mapping of the hublersburg series in the same area braker 1981 although the hublersburg series has been mapped within the study site walker and lin 2008 noted the absence of a hublersburg series due to the absence of rock fragments within the soil the hagerstown series consists of soils that are known to fine downward with an increased clay content at depth andrews et al 2016 both the hublersburg series and the hagerstown series are soils derived from the decomposition of limestone and dolomite although the depth of the overburden soil within the astronomy site varies the average depth of the soil throughout the mines member is 43 feet compared to 87 feet of soil overlaying the upper sandy member caruccio 1963 the overburden sediment above the mines dolomite is almost assuredly solely from the decomposition of the mines dolomite due to the high occurrence of both oolitic cherts and a high clay content as the soil composing the mines member is of a finer texture than the coarse soil of the upper sandy member caruccio 1963 estimated that the thickness of the regolith above the upper sandy member should be at least twice as much of that the regolith above the mines member based on the 15 orthoquartzite content in the upper sandy member 2 4 fracture trace and depression location methods the evolution of geospatial technologies has made it possible to use a variety of data processing tools to verify the visual cues of depressions and fracture traces and to detect asymptomatic fractures and depressions the availability of high resolution digital terrain models dtm has become more abundant in recent years with data now available for the astronomy site from the years 2007 and 2017 the resolution of the dtm s from 2007 and 2017 used for this study are 2 2 ft which is a high enough resolution to determine areal extent although it has a tendency to smooth some vertical features at this resolution the dtm from 2007 is derived from orthoimages while the dtm from 2017 is derived from lidar both dtm s use the pennsylvania state plane north fips 3701 nad 83 datum that are in units of feet a higher resolution lidar is recommended however for a more in depth analysis for volume change within depressions 2 4 1 methods of fracture delineation as a variance characterizes the fracture trace orientations in this strike area from n5w to n5e based on the bedrock exposures matzke 1961 the downslope faces of the fracture traces should be illuminated when a hillshade map is created perpendicularly to the strike the lineations which were within the living filter specifically were measured between 3 and 15 ne served as the baseline orientations for the fracture trace identification process a manual process was then created for the identification of fracture traces using arcgis 10 6 1 the outline and design of which is in fig s4 in order to determine the position of fracture traces in the area of the astronomy site the hillshade tool within the surface toolset was used to construct a map with an azimuth of 282 and an altitude of 45 interpreted as sun shining from 282 with a 45 sun angle the aspect tool located in the surface toolset was next used for the identification of fracture traces isolated by the hillshade map to determine the direction of each cell within the dtm the aspect of the cell is perpendicular to the strike of the cell like that of both the strike and dip in the structural geology all cells with an aspect of between 273 and 285 degrees were extracted from the data at which point the raster to polygon tool in the conversion toolset was used for their conversion to polygons fig 5a in order to determine the validation of the fracture trace locations based on aspect orientation the cell aspects were isolated in groups of 12 0 12 12 24 24 36 36 48 48 60 60 72 72 84 84 96 96 108 108 120 120 132 132 144 144 156 156 168 168 180 degrees figs s5 s19 once the polygons were created the majority filter tool located in the generalization toolset was used to remove polygons without five of the eight surrounding pixels of the same value once the majority filter was complete the boundary clean tool within the generalization toolset was set to descend to ensure a merging of the larger area polygons with the smaller thus making the fracture traces easier to identify finally a polyline layer and the editor toolbar was used to create the manually drawn fracture traces and the zonal geometry as table tool located in the zonal toolset was used to determine the fracture orientations the length and width of fractures were not recorded for this study as the fractures often extended off site and out of the scope of our research area fig 5b in order to ensure the accuracy of the results a control site was established for the game lands site the same fracture analysis as outlined above was conducted on both the forested and unforested sections of the game lands site in order to statistically validate the efficacy of these methods in identifying fractures of similar orientations fig s20 the fracture traces from the astronomy site and the game lands site were then statistically analyzed a two sample t test of unequal variance between the two sets of measured fractures with an alpha of 0 025 was used to assess if the fractures have the same orientation 2 4 2 methods of closed hillslope depression identification an adapted automated difference process for depression identification as shown in fig s21 was next used to determine the location of depressions within the astronomy site doctor and young 2013 jeanpert et al 2016 using the fill tool located in the hydrology toolset the depressions in the land were determined by isolating those cells that were lower than the surrounding counterparts at which point they were filled to their pour point and the elevation raster smoothed after creation the fill raster was subtracted from the original dtm using the raster calculator tool located in the map algebra toolset to isolate areas of depression using the reclass tool located in the reclassify toolset all depressions deeper than three inches were reclassified to a value of 1 and depressions less than three inches were classified as no data in order to de noise the data fig 6a the select by attributes tool was used to select only those depressions within 50 feet of a lineament and more than five feet away from unpaved roads given that lineaments in this area typically average 50 feet in width this number was used to reduce error from the created thin polylines all depressions with an area larger than 10 ft2 and five feet of the unpaved roads in this area which are composed a fine grain gravel were selected and exported to create a new dataset the purpose of this selection was to prevent any skewing of the results of the depression formation from the high hydraulic conductivity and from the depressions within five feet of those roads which are characterized by a flat edge that parallels them the presence of burrows and other smaller natural features necessitated using an area above 10 ft2 to further reduce the noise in the data zonal geometry was used to tabulate the orientation of the depressions for statistical comparisons between the years 2007 and 2017 fig 6b in order to analyze the change in areal extent the previously described processes were performed upon dtm s from years 2007 and 2017 all selected depressions were then exported into a separate layer the polygon to raster tool in the conversion toolset was then used to reconvert the data into raster data that was then reclassified as 1 for depressions from the year 2007 and 2 for depressions from the year 2017 in order to symbolize areal progression the raster calculator tool located in the map algebra toolset was used to create a raster calculation to combine both rasters the values of 3 indicated the presence of depressions in both the years 2007 and 2017 the values of 1 indicated their presence in only 2007 and values of 2 indicated their presence in only 2017 fig 7 cross sections were created along the center line of six depressions three in the cropped area and three in the forested area the profile graph tool in the 3d analyst toolbar was used to create these cross sections for the 2007 and 2017 depression areas via interpolation of a line along the cross section depressions were analyzed for both sites to consider the occurrence of various erosional processes and the potential ecological impacts of various plant life growth fig 8 the orientation of the depression in both the forested and cropped sites of the astronomy site were then statistically analyzed a two sample t test assuming unequal variances was conducted on the orientation of the depressions in both the forested and cropped sites between the years 2007 and 2017 using an alpha of 0 025 to assess if the orientations of the depressions were similar to principle orientation 3 results 3 1 fractures zonal geometry was used to trace and compare a series of fracture traces within the astronomy site for comparison with the established results of matzke 1961 and parizek et al 1967 the data in the resulting frequency graph of all determined ne sw fractures was near identical to that developed by matzke in 1961 table 2 also photographs from the 1940 s 1980 s 1990 s and early 2000 s indicated the presence of visible fracture traces as evidenced by lack of vegetation and straight surface ponding areas 3 2 depressions elongations of three depressions along a single fracture in the same direction as the original fracture trace were also observed an analysis of the areal progression from 2007 and 2017 indicated a net positive change in area with a propagation of the area of the depressions down the hillslope and that were filled in up slope a net positive area change of all depressions located within 50 feet of the fracture trace centers and more than five feet from all unpaved roads indicated a progression of nearly 8000 ft2 of these depressions during the period from 2007 to 2017 figs 9 11 finally although the cross sections of the selected depressions during the 2007 2017 period in the cropped and forested sites indicated variations in morphology none was observed in both depth and height figs 10 and 11 4 discussion the results of a slope aspect identification approach which is appropriate for datasets with a fracture area width that is greater than the individual cell size clearly elucidates the linear features in the area of the astronomy site the dtm that was used for slope aspect identification has a resolution of 2 2 feet unlike the swales and depressions in the area that have been known to exceed 50 feet in width matzke 1961 the results of the fracture traces from table 2 are corroborated by matzke s findings in the region of the pennsylvania furnace anticline no significant lineations or depressions were identified despite a separate analysis to determine the presence of perpendicular fractures in the area matzke 1961 referred to the perpendicular e w fractures as secondary in nature and less developed than those trending n s the regional geology of centre county pa and the orthoquartzite ridges that surround the astronomy site are oriented at 52 ne which is a divergent angle from the two dominant fractures matzke 1961 speculated that fractures in this area are the result of some regional event because they occur on both the hanging and foot walls of thrust faults in this area local joint patterns occur 45 off axis from the dominant fracture trace direction and contradict the original postulation of lattman and nickelsen 1958 that fractures and joints are near perpendicular in this area fig 12 the fracture rose diagram results from this research north of the pennsylvania furnace anticline and south of the marengo syncline closely match those of matzke 1961 fig 12 the limitations of the manual correlation from the slope aspect map however prevented an accurate characterization of both the density and numbers of fractures within the study area a higher number of fractures are evident however when using the fracture maps of parizek et al 1967 and lattman and parizek 1964 for comparison using a photogrammetric approach parizek et al 1967 and lattman and parizek 1964 mapped fractures based on their surficial manifestations as linear features with discernable change in color vegetation and standing water in order to avoid any sort of manual bias when mapping the fracture traces the development of an automatic script could possibly reduce error in these regards when looking at all the identified depressions regardless of their proximity to either roads or fractures results of the underlying hillshade map clearly indicate the presence of several elliptical features that have not been identified by the fill tool in that the fill tool operates by creating a pour point of the lowest elevation the manifestation of a non detect error in the tool is possible when depressions are located on steeper hillslopes if a pour point spills over prematurely given its location upon a slope it will not collect water of enough depth for identification and is thus eliminated during the de noising process the elongation of depressions in the direction of the fracture may also obscure the detection of depressions in that they fail to create a fully enclosed ellipsoid shape indeed some of these non ellipsoid shapes may well be what caruccio 1963 characterized as swales within the mines member the fracture traces from the astronomy site and the game lands site were then statistically analyzed a two sample t test of unequal variance between the two sets of measured fractures with an alpha of 0 025 corresponding to two standard deviations yields a null hypothesis that the fractures have the same orientation a skewing of the data in one direction or another from human error is possible however in that these fractures were drawn by hand table s1 it is unknown the extent to which the land upon which the astronomy site currently occupies has been used for agricultural purposes but such was the case prior to the inception of the site in 1962 historical photos also show that much of the now forested site was clear cut and cropped as far back as 1938 the continued use of the cropped portion of the living filter for agricultural purposes could potentially influence the extent of the depressions due to the lessened interception of precipitation and irrigation overland flow was an issue within the cropped area prior to the construction of a wetland area and drainage pipes at the bottom of the upper hillslope the lack of interception can be correlated to a higher rate of erosion thus depositing more fill material within the depressions and increasing the ap horizon depth as shown in walker and lin 2008 the living filter was also tilled until the mid 1990 s meaning that there were at least 35 years where the depressions could have been smoothed by tillage a depression change analysis was ran on the non university owned parcel northeast of the study site were tillage is suspected to still occur and there are significantly fewer identifiable depression features the lessening of the depressions within the cropped site is corroborated by the fact that the area of the depressions detected within the cropped site has been reduced by over 5000 ft2 since 2007 within the forested site the opposite of that which is occurring within the cropped site seems to correspond to an increase of 13 000 ft2 of the areal extent of depressions these findings are similar to that of a study in central belgium of closed depressions both within forested and cropped sites that were remnants of anthropogenic mining practices gillijns et al 2005 gillijns et al 2005 found that depressions within the cropped area had a wider areal extent shallower depth and a gentler relief due to the effects of tillage splash erosion and inter rill rill erosion whereas the depressions within the forested site were characterized by a steeper relief due to the protection and interception of the forest canopy cross sections taken in arcgis of these multiple depressions both in the cropped site and in the forested site do not reflect significant change in the depth of the depressions along the cross sectional line although the morphology of the depressions has varied within the past 10 years as evidenced by the cross sections the findings from the cross sections once again confirm gillijn s analysis of the depression shapes they noted that the depressions within the cropped land had infilled and created a v shaped cross section while the depressions within the forested site had preserved their original u shaped cross sections these classifications between both the v shaped and u shaped depressions are defined as bowl v shaped and saucer u shaped depressions kołodyńska gawrysiak and chabudziński 2014 a mean orientation of 10 ne and of 358 nw characterized the respective depressions within the forested and cropped sites which further indicated large variations in their standard deviations which were 31 and 43 of both sites respectively the irregularity of the orientation and shapes of the depressions indicates the possible manifestations of the secondary fracture traces that skews the shape of the depressions with the assumed substantive transmissivity of the intersecting fractures it is possible that depressions not oriented along the primary fracture trace occur above secondary fractures the same could be true of intercepting joint patterns a two sample t test assuming unequal variances was conducted on the orientation of the depressions in both the forested and cropped sites between the years 2007 and 2017 using an alpha of 0 025 and a null hypothesis of the orientations of the depressions were similar to principle orientation we accepted such a hypothesis for the 2007 and 2017 depressions identified for both the forested and the cropped sites tables s2 and s3 using those same parameters and same null hypothesis we also accepted the null hypothesis when comparing the cropped site to the forested site tables s4 and s5 the lack of ground control points for the 2007 orthorectified dtm and the 2017 orthorectified dtm makes it impossible to determine the accuracy of the elevation from both models a traditional rule of thumb is that the error of the model should be less than 2 pixels 4 feet devos and kay 2005 as such given the level of accuracy needed for a full vertical comparison of the depressions the resolution of our datasets was not suitable therefore subsequent research is recommended in order to account for any errors in the depression isolation for those depressions located in areas of steep relief due to the inability of the fill tool to recognize these areas as pour points further the limitations of the depression isolation to features that are enclosed enough to form a pour point prevents its use in identifying depressions with either a lowered edge or an incomplete elliptical shape the possibility of intercepting joints and fractures must also be considered for the orientation distribution of depressions expanding the dataset to include a larger study area would likely rectify the mean orientation and standard deviation with an expanded inventory of depressions coring geochemical analysis like that of norton 1986 should also be explored in order to determine the depth and age of transported sediment within the depressions a secondary area of future study may entail the combination of both the gis technique outlined here with traditional photogrammetry practices along with advanced photogrammetry practices such a premise is possible given the availability of high resolution images detailing this area over multiple time periods particularly the years 2007 2012 2015 and 2017 it is also possible to implement and combine a workflow that is similar to that developed by pokharel 2007 siart et al 2009 and kakavas et al 2015 to more thoroughly elucidate fracture trace locations in areas that are characterized by skewed slope face orientation caused by the position of the landscape kakavas et al 2015 pokharel 2007 siart et al 2009 in addition our gis based workflow may be coupled with seismic techniques to determine the location network and evolution of fractures the coupling of our gis based workflow with seismological techniques using p waves or s waves pyraknolte et al 1990a b ukar et al 2020 would allow high spatial and temporal resolutions of the characterization of fractures a third area of future research may entail the integration of point process statistics to the gis based workflow that we developed for analyzing the spatial distribution of closed hillslope depressions and spatial arrangement of fractures in two dimensions a two dimensional spatial analysis of closed hillslope depressions and fractures using point process statistics bonneau and stoyan 2022 correa et al 2022 stoyan and penttinen 2000 would further our understanding on the arrangement patterns e g random clustered and regular of these landforms that configurate the landscape as well as identified preferential arrangement patterns 5 conclusion this study identified and related any bedrock fracture traces and surface depressions to surficial or geomorphologic processes currently underway at the site of the living filter the previous measurements of fracture traces in this area undertaken by matzke 1961 lattman and parizek 1964 and parizek et al 1967 yielded results in a near n s orientation the use of a manual process to estimate the primary fracture trace angles yielded results nearly identical to that of the aforementioned authors a high occurrence of depressions was noted in the area of fractures compared to non fractured bedrock in the areal extent we observed a dissipation of depressions within the cropped site and a growth in the depressions in the forested site the depressions in the living filter were found to have a net gain of 8000 ft2 the result of which was from the net loss of 5000 ft2 within the agricultural portion of the site and a net gain of 13 000 ft2 within the forested portion of the site cross sections of several depressions within cropped areas indicated a lower angle slope corresponding to a v shape while depressions within forested areas were characterized by a traditional u shape and previously established steeper slope these findings will enhance the current understanding of the different morphologic characteristics of both forested and agricultural depressions in karst topography the workflows implemented here can be implemented in similar sites that display topographical variances from the bedrock fractures however further study of the transport of sediments within both land regimes is needed to fully characterize the extent to which these depressions are changing in terms of horizontal and vertical behavior funding this

9056,this research aimed to study the effects of different cover crops on chemical and physical properties in olive orchards under tropical conditions to investigate erosive processes by measuring soil and water losses and to determine the best management cover crop in olive orchards we assessed soil and water losses under different cover management practices olive planted on bare soil obs intercropped olive with spontaneous vegetation osv intercropped olive with jack beans ojb intercropped olive with millet omi intercropped olive with sunn hemp osh and bare soil bs the experiment was carried out for two hydrological years 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 in the southern region of minas gerais brazil experimental setup consisted of fifteen standard plots 12 m x 4 m in a cambisol with slope of 0 23 m m 1 in both rainy seasons treatments with cover crops showed significant efficiency to reduce soil loss osv treatment showed good performance in the reduction of water erosion revealing lower values of total soil loss of 25 mg ha 1 period 1 and 0 55 mg ha 1 period 1 in first and second season respectively based on the results it is recommended to use spontaneous vegetation as a cover crop in olive plantations at least during the first season this proved to be able to reduce soil and water losses for subsequent years a combination or a transition of other cover crops is possible since soil losses for treatments ojb 0 41 mg ha 1 period 1 and osv 0 55 mg ha 1 period 1 were statistically grouped using a non metric multidimensional scaling with a good performance final stress 0 069 this decision between spontaneous vegetation or a profitable cover crop should be adopted by farmers considering technical and financial aspects keywords soil conservation water loss conservation agriculture data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction cover cropping is a soil conservationist practice that can reduce runoff and sediment yields from the cultivated area by intercepting the rainfall kinetic energy and reducing runoff amount and velocity dabney et al 2001 these practices aim to protect and improve soil conditions between successive principal crops or between tree rows in orchards koudahe et al 2022 cover crops provide multiple potential ecosystem services novara et al 2021 enhance soil conditions by improving soil fertility and soil health duan et al 2020 silva et al 2021 reduce soil compaction blanco canqui and claassen 2011 de moura et al 2021 ensure soil coverage beniaich et al 2019 avoid the soil sealing and crusting beniaich et al 2020 lima et al 2018 and improve biological physical and chemical soil properties bechara et al 2018 furthermore cover crops increase the carbon sequestration and consequently greenhouse gas emissions are decreased guimarães et al 2021 blanco canqui 2022 additionally soil resilience is improved lima et al 2018 together with soil biodiversity zuazo and pleguezuelo 2008 cover crops also play an important role to control water erosion by breaking the erosion cycle through dissipating the rainfall kinetic energy and protecting the soil surface and soil structure rosa et al 2013 the efficiency of erosion reduction by the cover crops depends mainly on the plant morphological characteristics leaf size shape and angle of disposal relative to the stem speed of growth and soil aggregation capacity castro et al 2011 according to stocking 1994 there are many conservation practices but the most efficient practice and adaptable to concurrent management practices is cover cropping however an adequate soil management system requires appropriate management of soil organic matter som which is a preponderant parameter to maintain a resilient soil ecosystem and improve soil properties in olive orchards cover crops can increase the water retention capacity and soil water content by increasing the som and soil porosity sastre et al 2018 cover crop adoption in olive orchards is a practice that needs adequate comprehension of the cover crop cycle to avoid any competition that could disturb the olive plantation productivity alcántara et al 2011 in general the cut of the cover crop is performed in the end of the rainfall season to ensure protection against water erosion and to avoid the water competition between the main crop and the cover crops during the dry season asynchronous cycles taking into account the nutritional quality of cover crop biomass that could be used as forage for animals rodrigues et al 2015 it has been reported that cover crops reduced runoff and soil loss as compared with conventional tillage in olive orchard gomes et al 2009 novara et al 2021 in addition cover crops in olive orchards increased infiltration rates improved soil structure and aggregate stability by increasing the cementation of soil particles promoted by the increased soil organic matter content gómez et al 2009 thus improving the chemical and physical properties of the soil and enhancing the soil biological activity gómez et al 2009 cover cropping as a soil management strategy can be challenging as selecting an appropriate cover crop requires knowledge of the cover crop s physiological characteristics to prevent competition with the main crop alcántara et al 2011 therefore it is crucial to find the right balance between disadvantages and benefits of cover cropping taking into consideration the climate regime and specific characteristics such as time to maturity and development of the main crop novara et al 2021 recently the use of spontaneous vegetation as cover crop has been reported in the literature regarding olive orchards it presented good performance in protecting the soil against erosion and promoting soil fertility lópez vicente et al 2022 which generates a reduction in the farmer s investment in fertilizers an important aspect in the current situation of insecurity regarding access to fertilizers several approaches are used to evaluate the impact of conservationist practices in improving soil properties and its relations with water erosion keesstra et al 2016 silva et al 2021 keesstra et al 2016 and silva et al 2021 evaluated the relationship between soil properties and water erosion using principal component analysis pca pca was an effective tool to discriminate management systems based on the interaction between physical properties and soil organic matter and their relationship to water erosion in different soil management systems in orchards keesstra et al 2016 santos et al 2021 assessed this relationship using a novel soil quality index based on fuzzy logic classification according to the aforementioned authors the soil quality results showed that the lowest values of soil and water losses corresponded to the highest soil quality therefore we hypothesized that usage of cover crops in olive orchards will improve soil physical and chemical properties and reduce water erosion in tropical conditions the objectives of this research were a to study the effects of different cover crops on chemical and physical properties in olive orchards b to investigate the erosive processes by measuring the soil and water losses under different cover crops and c to determine the best management cover crop in olive orchards under tropical conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site this research was conducted at the experimental area of the federal university of lavras minas gerais brazil 21 13 20 s and 44 58 17 w fig 1 from november 2015 to may 2017 during two hydrological years 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 the

in the subsoil table 1 2 2 experimental design the experiment took place in an olive plantation of the cultivar arbequina with spacing of 4 m between plants and 5 m between lines considering the maximum slope direction the orchard was planted in march 2015 olive fertilization was applied following the recommendation of neto vieira et al 2008 in the olive plantation we applied a mixture consisting of 20 liters of manure 100 g of limestone and 500 g of single superphosphate to each tree planting hole for the annual fertilization in the 2015 2016 season we applied 50 g of ammonium sulfate to each tree in november december and january for the annual fertilization in the 2016 2017 season we applied 100 g of ammonium sulfate 50 g of potassium chloride and 20 g of boric acid to each tree in october in december we applied 100 g of ammonium sulfate and 50 g of potassium chloride to each tree in january we applied 100 g of ammonium sulfate to each tree during the dry season we manually irrigated the olive plantation to meet the plants water demands the experimental design consisted of five treatments soil management systems replicated three times in completely randomized blocks in the first hydrologic year the five treatments were 1 bare soil bs soil was maintained free of weed and vegetation by chemical weed control and manual weeding 2 olive planted in bare soil obs 3 olive associated with jack bean ojb 4 olive associated with millet omi and 5 olive associated with spontaneous vegetation osv in the second hydrologic year to test the performance of other cover crops the plots with millet were replaced by sunn hemp osh the spontaneous vegetation was composed of grasses being brachiaria decumbens stapf the dominant species and other species such digitaria sanguinalis l eleusine indica l euphorbia heterophylla amaranthus viridis emilia fosbergii nicolson and bidens pilosa fig 2 cover crops jack beans millet and sunn hemp were manually seeded at the beginning of the rainy season of the hydrological year november in the treatment with jack beans soil furrows were spaced at every 0 5 m in a density of eight seeds m 1 regarding millet and sunn hemp the spacing used was 0 25 m with densities of 90 seeds m 1 and 40 seeds m 1 respectively regarding the fertilization of the cover crops 500 kg ha 1 of npk 8 28 16 in the first year and 250 kg ha 1 npk

the monthly precipitation mm and p is the annual precipitation mm 2 ei 30 85 672 r c 0 6557 3 erosivity corrected 1 17 erosivity aquino model 22 94 2 4 soil chemical and physical properties soil properties were evaluated in the two hydrological years at the beginning of june during the dry period of each year we selected three points in each plot to sample undisturbed soil using rings 0 067 m of diameter and 0 081 m of height undisturbed soil samples were collected at three depths 0 0 20 0 20 0 40 and 0 40 0 60 m using an uhland soil sampler for the determination of soil porosity undisturbed soil samples were saturated for 48 h by capillarity with water up to two thirds of the ring height after the saturation period the samples were weighed and then drained at the potential of a 0 60 m height of water column using a tension table and samples were weighted after achieving equilibrium after a 24 hour oven dry at 105 ºc dry soil mass was measured the physical properties that were determined included total porosity tp using the method described by dlapa et al 2020 which involved the measurement of saturated volumetric soil water content θs microporosity mip which was calculated based on the soil water content of soil samples at a water potential ψ of 0 60 m vomocil 1986 macroporosity map which was calculated as the difference between tp and mip eq 4 and soil bulk density bd which was determined by dividing the dry soil mass by the corresponding soil volume blake and hartge 2018 eq 5 4 map θ s θ m where θs m3 m 3 is the saturated volumetric water content of the bulk soil and θm m3 m 3 is the volumetric water content of the soil micropores of diameter less than 50 µm at a ψ of 0 6 m 5 bd ms vb where ms g is oven dry soil mass and vb cm 3 is the corresponding bulk soil volume undisturbed soil aggregate stability was performed using yoder type sieves immersed in water the sieve set used in the analysis included meshes with diameters of 2 mm 1 mm 0 5 mm 0 25 mm and 0 105 mm and the methodology followed was that described by kemper and rosenau 1986 aggregate stability was assessed by calculating the geometric mean diameter gmd and the weighted mean diameter wmd based on the percentages of aggregates retained in each class angers et al 2008 saturated soil hydraulic conductivity ks was determined using the method proposed by teixeira et al 2017 and soil texture was determined using the pipette method according to day 1965 regarding the soil chemical attributes ph in water exchangeable ca2 mg2 al3 available p and k extracted with mehlich 1

saturation m were calculated according to the equation described by teixeira et al 2017 soil organic matter som was determined according to walkley and black 1934 the variation of each chemical properties cpi for both seasons in the treatment i was calculated by eq 6 6 variation cpi treatment i cpi season 2 cpi season 1 cpi season 1 100 2 5 soil and water losses water erosion was determined using 15 standard erosion plots adapted from wischmeier and smith 1978 standard erosion plots were 12 m long by 4 m wide erosion plots were set up in the slope direction limited with galvanized plates with a height of 0 40 m buried at a depth of 0 20 m fig 1 soil and water losses were sampled using collection tanks installed at the bottom of each plot after each rainfall event cogo et al 2003 tank sets were comprised of two boxes with 250 l capacity connected through a geib type splitter with nine windows wischmeier and smith 1978 these windows allowed that only 1 9 of the runoff was conducted into the second tank after filling the first in addition we evaluated the relationship between the amount of runoff collected in each plot and the amount of rainfall received using the runoff coefficient rc expressed by the eq 7 bombino et al 2021 7 rc amout of runoff collected in the plot amount of rainfall received 2 6 statistical analysis impact of different treatments on the studied variables soil physical and chemical properties was performed using analysis of variance anova when anova null hypothesis was rejected pairwise comparisons were performed via tukey test to determine significant differences among means the relationships between different variables were performed via linear regression and correlation analyses to compute the coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse and pearson correlation coefficients r the data of all treatments were analyzed based on multivariate patterns in two dimensions using non metric multidimensional scaling nmds kruskal 1964 differences in soil physical and chemical properties soil loss and total runoff were visualized with nmds ordination of dissimilarity nmds is a non parametric rank based method underlying assumptions of linearity which are common in pca and its variants kenkel 2006 in order to reduce the variability of data and the influence of extreme values the variables values were log transformed ln x 1 to ensure that all variables had equal effect on the ordination and to prevent numerical large variables we standardized all variables using hellinger standardization nmds is a powerful tool and is widely used due to its effectiveness fernández moya et al 2014 gomes et al 2016 guo et al 2016 miesel et al 2011 xu et al 2014 nmds ordination was measured by a metric called stress kruskal 1964 stress values below 0 15 are acceptable but stress below 0 1 is better nmds was performed on data with bray curtis distances using the vegan package dixon 2003 in r environment r core team 2017 generalized additive models gams were built using ordisurf function from the vegan package oksanen et al 2022 3 results 3 1 rainfall erosivity for the studied period the monthly rainfall erosivity ranged from 5 to 2077 mj mm ha 1 h 1 month 1 fig 3 the total value was 5249 mj mm ha 1 h 1 period 1 for the first rainy season and 3448 mj mm ha 1 h 1 period 1 in the second rainy season the rainfall erosivity presented an irregular monthly distribution however the rainfall erosivity is concentrated from november to february this period comprised 91 and 64 of total rainfall erosivity for 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 in addition there is a big difference between the maximum values of the study periods the first rainy season showed much greater rainfall erosivity than the second one 3 2 erosion soil loss soil losses in both rainy seasons 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 are presented in table 2 total soil loss ranged from 24 95 to 278 68 mg ha 1 period 1 in the first rainy season and from 0 41 to 287 29 mg ha 1 period 1 in the second rainy season during the studied periods a null loss was only recorded in may of 2015 2016 in season 2015 2016 the analysis of variance of the total soil loss revealed a significant effect of the soil management system in the soil loss p 0 05 bs and obs significantly differ from the other treatments with higher soil loss 268 and 279 mg ha 1 period 1 for bs and obs respectively osv treatment showed efficacy to reduce soil loss as this treatment presented the lowest total soil loss value 25 mg ha 1 period 1 and lowest value in the beginning of the season when it presented high rainfall erosivity and high soil erosion risk during different months in the first rainy season the treatments maintained the same trend with a significant difference among obs and bs group and the others treatment except for the months of november and april in the rainy season 2016 2017 we observed the same pattern as the first rainy season regarding the erosive responses in different treatment with significant differences were observed between treatments and bs and obs were significantly different compared to other treatments high rate of soil loss november and december was recorded in the beginning of the rainy season comparing the treatments bs and obs the interception of raindrops by olive trees was very low and the contribution of obs in the reduction of soil loss was only 2 as compared to bare soil in the second rainy season overall in both rainy seasons treatments bs and obs had the same behavior i e high soil loss without significant difference among them furthermore osv and ojb treatments showed promise to reduce soil erosion total soil loss was 291 19 mg ha 1 period 1 in bs and 287 29 mg ha 1 period 1 in obs followed by osh 9 97 mg ha 1 period 1 and lower soil losses in osv 0 55 mg ha 1 period 1 and ojb 0 41 mg ha 1 period 1 3 3 total runoff and runoff coefficient total runoff and runoff coefficients are shown in table 3 total runoff ranged from 99 2 to 567 95 mm period 1 in the first rainy season and from 25 13 to 387 75 mm period 1 in the second rainy season the analysis of variance of total runoff showed that soil management systems significantly impacted water loss by runoff in both periods p 0 05 in the first period the treatment based on olive associated with spontaneous vegetation osv recorded the lowest water loss with 99 2 mm period 1 of total runoff in the second rainy season the treatment of olive associated with cover crops presented lower value of total runoff ojb showed the lowest water losses of 25 13 mm period 1 followed by osh with 30 02 mm period 1 and osv with 37 68 mm period 1 runoff coefficient showed the same behavior as total runoff with significant differences among treatments in both periods p 0 05 for both periods treatments bs and obs were significantly different from other treatment based on cover crops however runoff coefficient in bs and obs ranged from 0 44 to 0 48 in other words approximately more than half of the rainfall received in the plots was direct lost by runoff runoff coefficient for treatment with cover crops showed the following order ojb 0 23 omi 0 14 and osv 0 09 in the first period and the following order in the second period osv 0 04 osh 0 03 ojb 0 03 the relationship between the erosivity and soil loss presented a positive correlation being a more prominent correlation for bs and obs treatments with correlation coefficients and coefficients of determination greater than 0 90 for both periods table 4 3 4 soil chemical properties soil chemical properties for the two periods under different management systems are presented in table 5 and tables s1 and s2 supplementary material there was high variability among treatments and depths regarding different chemical properties in the first rainy season of 2015 2016 no significant differences were observed comparing the effect of different treatments in all depths in the following chemical properties mg al h al and m however a significant effect was observed in ph k content and soil organic matter som in the second rainy season 2016 2017 the significant effect of cover crops appears on the following characteristics ph k mg al h al v and som regarding the som generally this property presented a low level in bs and obs treatments soil properties with significant differences among both periods are shown in fig 4 topsoil layer depth 0 5 cm was more sensitive to variations as compared to soil samples of other depths potential acidity h al showed a significant variation for treatment ojb at depth 0 5 cm and no effect was observed in the depths bellow fig 4 a regarding soil ph a significant variation of 8 was measured in depth 0 5 cm for treatment ojb and a decrease of this property for the rest of the treatments soil ph at depths 5 10 cm and 10 20 cm also presented lower values through time being computed a significant difference for treatment bs fig 4 b significant differences were computed regarding soil organic matter som at depth 0 5 cm a significant increase of 20 in som was measured for treatment ojb meanwhile a significant decrease of 2 for treatment bs the other depths presented no significant differences among them for som fig 4 c base saturation followed the same trend of ph presenting only significant differences at the topsoil layer 0 5 cm fig 4 d 3 5 soil physical properties bulk density bd showed high variability at the different depths for both studied seasons table 6 although there are no signs of soil compaction during the two studied periods treatments bs and obs presented similar trends in the first period at depth of 0 20 cm there were no computed significant differences among treatments for depths 20 40 and 40 60 cm bs and obs treatment were consistently grouped in the same statistical group p value 0 05 overall total porosity tp macroporosity map and microporosity mip presented the same pattern among treatments and depths with no significant effect for the studied periods the highest values of tp and map were observed at treatments osv and ojb and the lowest values in plots with treatment bs the effect is clear in the deeper layers by decreasing the porosity as was reported by palese et al 2014 cover crops promoted positively tp regarding the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks and soil aggregate stability no significant impact was recorded among treatments during the experiment at different depths for its low relevance the results of ks and soil aggregate stability are not presented in this study hydraulic conductivity classification soil survey staff 2014 for the first rainy season presented moderate permeability for soils under osv and omi whereas soils under other treatments showed moderately high permeability for the second rainy season treatments indeed modified the soil hydraulic classification moderate permeability for treatments obs and bs and moderately high for the rest of the assessed treatments 3 6 relating soil properties and water erosion table 7 presents the pearson correlation coefficients for the different studied variables these results concurred with the aforementioned findings tables 4 5 and 6 the soil loss sl had a positive and significant correlation with water loss 0 89 and aluminum 0 44 and a negative correlation with ph 0 69 and exchangeable k 0 50 regarding the water loss wl it had a negative correlation with ph 0 56 exchangeable k 0 43 wad 0 38 and gad 0 39 the results of the nmds performed to analyze the soil management system differentiation among soil erosion plots with the ordination of each soil properties among treatment unit year combinations as well soil and water losses are shown in fig 5a the two dimensional 2d nmds solution was representative indicating the usefulness of the ordination approach for extracting structure patterns from the experimental data final stress of the ordination was 0 069 after 20 iterations nmds showed that the bs treatments was more associated with high total runoff and water losses due to plot with bare soil and olive associated with bare soil presented the higher rate of soil and water erosion these treatments were arrayed to the left on nmds axis 1 according to both time cycles the 2016 2017 time cycles olive associated with sunn hemp olive associated with spontaneous vegetation and olive associated with jack bean plots were arrayed further to the right on nmds axis 1 nmds ordination analysis allowed to classify the pattern and performance of each treatment and soil properties however treatments with higher rate of soil and water erosion bare soil and olive planted in bare soil were associated with lower value of soil aggregate stability and soil ph fig 5b c cover crops impact became more evident for the second rainy season cover crops contributed to improve soil properties soil aggregate stability improved under treatments osv and ojb in addition it was observed a significant impact of cover crops in the reduction of soil acidification and the buffering capacity of the soil soil physical and chemical properties are influenced by soil management systems which can be observed by the effect of different treatments in the evolution of various soil properties 4 discussion 4 1 rainfall erosivity the region of study is at high risk for water erosion and soil loss due to its high rainfall erosivity particularly during the rainy season from november to february as well as agricultural management practices beniaich et al 2020 this has been previously reported by several studies aquino et al 2014 lima et al 2018 silva et al 2005 the values of total rainfall erosivity for the same period reported in this study are well aligned to those observed by lima et al 2018 ranged between 4050 and 8384 mj mm ha 1 h 1 period 1 4 2 soil and water losses by erosion high soil losses during november december and january of the first rainy season 2015 2016 can be explained by the high rainfall erosivity during these months 2275 mj mm ha 1 h 1 period 1 as compared to 1330 mj mm ha 1 h 1 period 1 for the second rainy season and by the soil disturbance caused by the operations of olive plantation and the seeding of cover crops during the first rainy season overall the pattern of rainfall is the main factor controlling the erosion particularly evident in treatments with bare soil bs and obs as the results showed i e strong correlation between soil loss and erosivity table 4 these results are in accordance with what has been reported in the literature regarding soil erosion being controlled by other factors such as precedent soil moisture soil cover and soil crusting lópez vicente et al 2022 poesen 1986 ramos and martínez casasnovas 2006 rodrigo comino et al 2018a zuazo et al 2009 the impact of cover crops on reducing water erosion was significant for treatments ojb and osv as results for soil losses showed in plots with treatments bs and obs we noted in different field observations the formation of soil crusts and sealing of the soil pores caused by the disruption of soil aggregates and dispersion of fine soil minerals poesen 1986 variation in soil erosion under different cover crop systems could be associated to the interaction between the plants themselves and the soil the crop capacity to explore soil and the growth of its root system promotes water infiltration the binding of soil particles and soil aggregation celette et al 2008 lópez vicente et al 2022 evaluated the effectiveness of a mixed ground cover temporary seeded cover crop and spontaneous vegetation in reducing the loss of soil nutrients by erosion observed an 8 3 times higher nutrient loss in soil with a lower percent of ground cover regarding the comparison between the studied cover crops no significant differences were observed among periods however osv and obj tended to present a higher efficiency in the reduction of soil and water loss cardoso et al 2013 reported that sunn hemp legume and millet cereal have a quick growth and a dense root system compared to jack bean legume in this studied region but jack bean is characterized by long duration crop cycle as compared to the other cover crops the latter physiological characteristic of jack bean allowed soil under treatment ojb to remain protected for a longer period as compared to the other treatments similarly spontaneous vegetation as a cover crop reduced soil erosion for both studied periods the high rate growth of brachiaria favored a homogeneous distribution of the vegetation in the plots additionally it was highly capable to adapt and regenerate from season to season despite the operations weed removal and soil preparation during experimental setup the highest water losses can be explained by the low cover vegetation index during the first year post plantation as it was observed in a previous study beniaich et al 2022 in addition the age of the main crop could also affect our results since young orchard olive trees present canopy and root systems not fully formed runoff coefficients were 6 15 times higher on plots with treatment bs as compared to plots with other treatments with consorted cover crops according to rodrigo comino et al 2018 the ratio between runoff coefficients of bare soil plots to plots with cover crops in olive orchards can reach up to 50 runoff coefficients reported by zuazo et al 2011 in olive orchards with spontaneous vegetation in mediterranean climate deferred to the results we computed this high variability in runoff coefficients in the literature may be associated to climatic conditions lima et al 2018 rodrigo comino et al 2018b as well as soil management systems and soil properties 4 3 soil properties and water erosion the results showed that some soil properties proved to be more sensitive to water erosion according to the results during the two hydrological years of field evaluation in an inceptisol susceptible to water erosion fig 5 the properties related to ph and soil organic matter presented a significant effect under different treatments the impact of cover crops was observed as increased soil organic matter content in the topsoil layer in accordance to results reported by repullo ruibérriz de torres et al 2021 however our results showed a significant increase of som for treatments osv and ojb up to 20 increase compared to the first period thus it was in the topsoil layer where there was a significant effect of management systems due to the accumulation of fresh plant derived carbon poffenbarger et al 2020 regarding the ph evaluation in this study we observed the correlation of the high rates of the erosion associated to treatments bs and obs and the soil acidification positive and the ph negative that can be explained by the loss of soil buffering capacity as a consequence of the loss of soil organic matter and clay particles várallya 1989 soil physical properties were also affected by the loss of som in plots with high erosion rates soil crusting was evident and som contents dropped this was also measured as diminished soil aggregate stability som is a cementation agent between mineral particles and other organic materials present in the soil matrix therefore when rainfall water breaks down soil aggregates fine soil particles are transported together with organic materials bronick and lal 2005 the role of som in improving soil physical properties appeared during the observations and measurements for the second year of the experiment increased hydraulic conductivity and reduced soil bulk density silva et al 2021 found that ecological intensification of cropping systems increased soil cover rate reduced soil water and nutrient losses and these correlated well with enhanced soil structure and increased grain yield evaluation of the impact of cover crops on chemical and physical properties of the soil can be considered as an efficient tool for the monitoring of the soil management systems and further study will allow understanding olive orchard ecosystems in addition other characteristics must be approached considering different processes and interaction in these systems such as the evaluation of soil indicators gómez and soriano 2020 the biological impact of cover crops castellano hinojosa and strauss 2020 the effects of cover crops on multiple ecosystem services shackelford et al 2019 and the integration of socio economical approaches rodríguez sousa et al 2019 in orchards similar results were obtained by palese et al 2014 regarding the difference in soil bulk density between treatments in olive orchard when comparing sustainable and conventional management systems low values of soil bulk density were reported for sustainable systems plots covered by spontaneous grasses soil bulk density decreases are caused by increased soil organic content root exudates and vegetation residues together with undisturbed fauna driving soil porosity up keesstra et al 2016 regarding soil porosity total porosity macroporosity and microporosity for treatments osv and ojb tended to show increases of these physical properties result of nmds presented a good performance with a final stress of 0 069 allowing to classy the treatments in three groups first group constituted by treatments bs and obs unsustainable treatments characterized by high rate of soil and water loss by water erosion low soil aggregation high al content second formed by the treatment omi and osh presented a transition group between the first and the second with high variability on studied soil properties third group constituted by osv and ojb sustainable treatments that presented low soil and water loss by water erosion and high soil aggregation high som and low ph fig 5 the use of cover crops in olive orchards showed the beneficial impacts that consorted vegetation can provide towards protecting the soil against water erosion and as a result improve soil properties according to studies conducted by guimarães et al 2021 the results showed that maintaining intercropped spontaneous vegetation at olive plantations allowed to improve the soil carbon stock and it reduced nutrient and carbon losses the results of this work are in accordance to other studies presenting the elimination of spontaneous vegetation in olive orchards as an unsustainable management system keesstra et al 2016 thus usage of spontaneous vegetation as cover crop is a good alternative to reduce soil and water erosion to increase som content and to improve soil properties 5 conclusions we tested the hypothesis that cover crops could reduce soil erosion and improve soil health in the early years after planting olive orchards inter row areas of the orchard with bare soil had higher rates of soil erosion as compared to areas with cover crops soil management systems with intercropped cover crops effectively controlled water erosion and improved soil health relating the impact of cover crops on soil properties we observed a significant impact of cover crops in the reduction of soil acidification and increased contents of soil organic matter soil physical and chemical properties were influenced by soil management systems and the use of spontaneous vegetation as a cover crop promoted the improvement of soil properties in these early years of olive plantation based on the results of this work it is recommended to use spontaneous vegetation as a cover crop in olive plantations at least during the first rainy season this proved to reduce soil and water losses for subsequent years a combination or a transition of other cover crops is possible since soil losses for treatments ojb 0 41 mg ha 1 period 1 and osv 0 55 mg ha 1 period 1 were statistically grouped using nmds with a good performance final stress 0 069 this decision between a spontaneous vegetation or a profitable cover crop should be adopted by farmers considering monetary costs and to prevent any sort of affection of the main crop declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

intercropped olive with spontaneous vegetation osv intercropped olive with jack beans ojb intercropped olive with millet omi intercropped olive with sunn hemp osh and bare soil bs the experiment was carried out for two hydrological years 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 in the southern region of minas gerais brazil experimental setup consisted of fifteen standard plots 12 m x 4 m in a cambisol with slope of 0 23 m m 1 in both rainy seasons treatments with cover crops showed significant efficiency to reduce soil loss osv treatment showed good performance in the reduction of water erosion revealing lower values of total soil loss of 25 mg ha 1 period 1 and 0 55 mg ha 1 period 1 in first and second season respectively based on the results it is recommended to use spontaneous vegetation as a cover crop in olive plantations at least during the first season this proved to be able to reduce soil and water losses for subsequent years a combination or a transition of other cover crops is possible

agriculture data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction cover cropping is a soil conservationist practice that can reduce runoff and sediment yields from the cultivated area by intercepting the rainfall kinetic energy and reducing runoff amount and velocity dabney et al 2001 these practices aim to protect and improve soil conditions between successive principal crops or between tree rows in orchards koudahe et al 2022 cover crops provide multiple potential ecosystem services novara et al 2021 enhance soil conditions by improving soil fertility and soil health duan et al 2020 silva et al 2021 reduce soil compaction blanco canqui and claassen 2011 de moura et al 2021 ensure soil coverage beniaich et al 2019 avoid the soil sealing and crusting beniaich et al 2020 lima et al 2018 and improve biological physical and chemical soil properties bechara et al 2018 furthermore cover crops increase the carbon sequestration and consequently greenhouse gas emissions are decreased guimarães et al 2021 blanco canqui 2022 additionally soil resilience is improved lima et al 2018 together with soil biodiversity zuazo and pleguezuelo 2008 cover crops also play an important role to control water erosion by breaking the erosion cycle through dissipating the rainfall kinetic energy and protecting the soil surface and soil structure rosa et al 2013 the efficiency of erosion reduction by the cover crops depends mainly on the plant morphological characteristics leaf size shape and angle of disposal relative to the stem speed of growth and soil aggregation capacity castro et al 2011 according to stocking 1994 there are many conservation practices but the most efficient practice and adaptable to concurrent management practices is cover cropping however an adequate soil management system requires appropriate management of soil organic matter som which is a preponderant parameter to maintain a resilient soil ecosystem and improve soil properties in olive orchards cover crops can increase the water retention capacity and soil water content by increasing the som and soil porosity sastre et al 2018 cover crop adoption in olive orchards is a practice that needs adequate comprehension of the cover crop cycle to avoid any competition that could disturb the olive plantation productivity alcántara et al 2011 in general the cut of the cover crop is performed in the end of the rainfall season to ensure protection against water erosion and to avoid the water competition between the main crop and the cover crops during the dry season asynchronous cycles taking into account the nutritional quality of cover crop biomass that could be used as forage for animals rodrigues et al 2015 it has been reported that cover crops reduced runoff and soil loss as compared with conventional tillage in olive orchard gomes et al 2009 novara et al 2021 in addition cover crops in olive orchards increased infiltration rates improved soil structure and aggregate stability by increasing the cementation of soil particles promoted by the increased soil organic matter content gómez et al 2009 thus improving the chemical and physical properties of the soil and enhancing the soil biological activity gómez et al 2009 cover cropping as a soil management strategy can be challenging as selecting an appropriate cover crop requires knowledge of the cover crop s physiological characteristics to prevent competition with the main crop alcántara et al 2011 therefore it is crucial to find the right balance between disadvantages and benefits of cover cropping taking into consideration the climate regime and specific characteristics such as time to maturity and development of the main crop novara et al 2021 recently the use of spontaneous vegetation as cover crop has been reported in the literature regarding olive orchards it presented good performance in protecting the soil against erosion and promoting soil fertility lópez vicente et al 2022 which generates a reduction in the farmer s investment in fertilizers an important aspect in the current situation of insecurity regarding access to fertilizers several approaches are used to evaluate the impact of conservationist practices in improving soil properties and its relations with water erosion keesstra et al 2016 silva et al 2021 keesstra et al 2016 and silva et al 2021 evaluated the relationship between soil properties and water erosion using principal component analysis pca pca was an effective tool to discriminate management systems based on the interaction between physical properties and soil organic matter and their relationship to water erosion in different soil management systems in orchards keesstra et al 2016 santos et al 2021 assessed this relationship using a novel soil quality index based on fuzzy logic classification according to the aforementioned authors the soil quality results showed that the lowest values of soil and water losses corresponded to the highest soil quality therefore we hypothesized that usage of cover crops in olive orchards will improve soil physical and chemical properties and reduce water erosion in tropical conditions the objectives of this research were a to study the effects of different cover crops on chemical and physical properties in olive orchards b to investigate the erosive processes by measuring the soil and water losses under different cover crops and c to determine the best management cover crop in olive orchards under tropical conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site this research was conducted at the

in the subsoil table 1 2 2 experimental design the experiment took place in an olive plantation of the cultivar arbequina with spacing of 4 m between plants and 5 m between lines considering the maximum slope direction the orchard was planted in march 2015 olive fertilization was applied following the recommendation of neto vieira et al 2008 in the olive plantation we applied a mixture consisting of 20 liters of manure 100 g of limestone and 500 g of single superphosphate to each tree planting hole for the annual fertilization in the 2015 2016 season we applied 50 g of ammonium sulfate to each tree in november december and january for the annual fertilization in the 2016 2017 season we applied 100 g of ammonium sulfate 50 g of potassium chloride and 20 g of boric acid to each tree in october in december we applied 100 g of ammonium sulfate and 50 g of potassium chloride to each tree in january we applied 100 g of ammonium sulfate to each tree during the dry season we manually irrigated the olive plantation to meet the plants water demands the experimental design consisted of five treatments soil management systems replicated three times in completely randomized blocks in the first hydrologic year the five treatments were 1 bare soil bs soil was maintained free of weed and vegetation by chemical weed control and manual weeding 2 olive planted in bare soil obs 3 olive associated with jack bean ojb 4 olive associated with millet omi and 5 olive associated with spontaneous vegetation osv in the second hydrologic year to test the performance of other cover crops the plots with millet were replaced by sunn hemp osh the spontaneous vegetation was composed of grasses being brachiaria decumbens stapf the dominant species and other species such digitaria sanguinalis l eleusine indica l euphorbia heterophylla amaranthus viridis emilia fosbergii nicolson and bidens pilosa fig 2 cover crops jack beans millet and sunn hemp were manually seeded at the beginning of the rainy season of the hydrological year november in the treatment with jack beans soil furrows were spaced at every 0 5 m in a density of eight seeds m 1 regarding millet and sunn hemp the spacing used was 0 25 m with densities of 90 seeds m 1 and 40 seeds m 1 respectively regarding the fertilization of the cover crops 500 kg ha 1 of npk 8 28 16 in the first year and 250 kg ha 1 npk 8 28 16 in the second year were applied for chemical weed control in bs and obs plots roundup formulation was used as herbicide according to the recommendation prescribed in the product leaflet monsanto 2002 2 3 rainfall erosivity rainfall erosivity was estimated applying the ei30 index using the modified fournier index arnoldus 1980 eq 1 as discussed by renard and freimund 1994 and using rainfall erosivity regional model developed by aquino et al 2012 and adjusted using the methodology proposed by yang and yu 2015 eq 2 and 3 1 r c p 2 p where rc is the coefficient of rainfall mm p is the monthly precipitation mm and p is the annual precipitation mm 2 ei 30 85 672 r c 0 6557 3 erosivity corrected 1 17 erosivity aquino model 22 94 2 4 soil chemical and physical properties soil properties were evaluated in the two hydrological years at the beginning of june during the dry period of each year we selected three points in each plot to sample undisturbed soil using rings 0 067 m of diameter and 0 081 m of height undisturbed soil samples were collected at three depths 0 0 20 0 20 0 40 and 0 40 0 60 m using an uhland soil sampler for the determination of soil porosity undisturbed soil samples were saturated for 48 h by capillarity with water up to two thirds of the ring height after the saturation period the samples were weighed and then drained at the potential of a 0 60 m height of water column using a tension table and samples were weighted after achieving equilibrium after a 24 hour oven dry at 105 ºc dry soil mass was measured the physical properties that were determined included total porosity tp using the method described by dlapa et al 2020 which involved the measurement of saturated volumetric soil water content θs microporosity mip which was calculated based on the soil water content of soil samples at a water potential ψ of 0 60 m vomocil 1986 macroporosity map which was calculated as the difference between tp and mip eq 4 and soil bulk density bd which was determined by dividing the dry soil mass by the corresponding soil volume blake and hartge 2018 eq 5 4 map θ s θ m where θs m3 m 3 is the saturated volumetric water content of the bulk soil and θm m3 m 3 is the volumetric water content of the soil micropores of diameter less than 50 µm at a ψ of 0 6 m 5 bd ms vb where ms g is oven dry soil mass and vb cm 3 is the corresponding bulk soil volume undisturbed soil aggregate stability was performed using yoder type sieves immersed in water the sieve set used in the analysis included meshes with diameters of 2 mm 1 mm 0 5 mm 0 25 mm and 0 105 mm and the methodology followed was that described by kemper and rosenau 1986 aggregate stability was assessed by calculating the geometric mean diameter gmd and the weighted mean diameter wmd based on the percentages of aggregates retained in each class angers et al 2008 saturated soil hydraulic conductivity ks was determined using the method proposed by teixeira et al 2017 and soil texture was determined using the pipette method according to day 1965 regarding the soil chemical attributes ph in water exchangeable ca2 mg2 al3 available p and k extracted with mehlich 1

saturation m were calculated according to the equation described by teixeira et al 2017 soil organic matter som was determined according to walkley and black 1934 the variation of each chemical properties cpi for both seasons in the treatment i was calculated by eq 6 6 variation cpi treatment i cpi season 2 cpi season 1 cpi season 1 100 2 5 soil and water losses water erosion was determined using 15 standard erosion plots adapted from wischmeier and smith 1978 standard erosion plots were 12 m long by 4 m wide erosion plots were set up in the slope direction limited with galvanized plates with a height of 0 40 m buried at a depth of 0 20 m fig 1 soil and water losses were sampled using collection tanks installed at the bottom of each plot after each rainfall event cogo et al 2003 tank sets were comprised of two boxes with 250 l capacity connected through a geib type splitter with nine windows wischmeier and smith 1978 these windows allowed that only 1 9 of the runoff was conducted into the second tank after filling the first in addition we evaluated the relationship between the amount of runoff collected in each plot and the amount of rainfall received using the runoff coefficient rc expressed by the eq 7 bombino et al 2021 7 rc amout of runoff collected in the plot amount of rainfall received 2 6 statistical analysis impact of different treatments on the studied variables soil physical and chemical properties was performed using analysis of variance anova when anova null hypothesis was rejected pairwise comparisons were performed via tukey test to determine significant differences among means the relationships between different variables were performed via linear regression and correlation analyses to compute the coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse and pearson correlation coefficients r the data of all treatments were analyzed based on multivariate patterns in two dimensions using non metric multidimensional scaling nmds kruskal 1964 differences in soil physical and chemical properties soil loss and total runoff were visualized with nmds ordination of dissimilarity nmds is a non parametric rank based method underlying assumptions of linearity which are common in pca and its variants kenkel 2006 in order to reduce the variability of data and the influence of extreme values the variables values were log transformed ln x 1 to ensure that all variables had equal effect on the ordination and to prevent numerical large variables we standardized all variables using hellinger standardization nmds is a powerful tool and is widely used due to its effectiveness fernández moya et al 2014 gomes et al 2016 guo et al 2016 miesel et al 2011 xu et al 2014 nmds ordination was measured by a metric called stress kruskal 1964 stress values below 0 15 are acceptable but stress below 0 1 is better nmds was performed on data with bray curtis distances using the vegan package dixon 2003 in r environment r core team 2017 generalized additive models gams were built using ordisurf function from the vegan package oksanen et al 2022 3 results 3 1 rainfall erosivity for the studied period the monthly rainfall erosivity ranged from 5 to 2077 mj mm ha 1 h 1 month 1 fig 3 the total value was 5249 mj mm ha 1 h 1 period 1 for the first rainy season and 3448 mj mm ha 1 h 1 period 1 in the second rainy season the rainfall erosivity presented an irregular monthly distribution however the rainfall erosivity is concentrated from november to february this period comprised 91 and 64 of total rainfall erosivity for 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 in addition there is a big difference between the maximum values of the study periods the first rainy season showed much greater rainfall erosivity than the second one 3 2 erosion soil loss soil losses in both rainy seasons 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 are presented in table 2 total soil loss ranged from 24 95 to 278 68 mg ha 1 period 1 in the first rainy season and from 0 41 to 287 29 mg ha 1 period 1 in the second rainy season during the studied periods a null loss was only recorded in may of 2015 2016 in season 2015 2016 the analysis of variance of the total soil loss revealed a significant effect of the soil management system in the soil loss p 0 05 bs and obs significantly differ from the other treatments with higher soil loss 268 and 279 mg ha 1 period 1 for bs and obs respectively osv treatment showed efficacy to reduce soil loss as this treatment presented the lowest total soil loss value 25 mg ha 1 period 1 and lowest value in the beginning of the season when it presented high rainfall erosivity and high soil erosion risk during different months in the first rainy season the treatments maintained the same trend with a significant difference among obs and bs group and the others treatment except for the months of november and april in the rainy season 2016 2017 we observed the same pattern as the first rainy season regarding the erosive responses in different treatment with significant differences were observed between treatments and bs and obs were significantly different compared to other treatments high rate of soil loss november and december was recorded in the beginning of the rainy season comparing the treatments bs and obs the interception of raindrops by olive trees was very low and the contribution of obs in the reduction of soil loss was only 2 as compared to bare soil in the second rainy season overall in both rainy seasons treatments bs and obs had the same behavior i e high soil loss without significant difference among them furthermore osv and ojb treatments showed promise to reduce soil erosion total soil loss was 291 19 mg ha 1 period 1 in bs and 287 29 mg ha 1 period 1 in obs followed by osh 9 97 mg ha 1 period 1 and lower soil losses in osv 0 55 mg ha 1 period 1 and ojb 0 41 mg ha 1 period 1 3 3 total runoff and runoff coefficient total runoff and runoff coefficients are shown in table 3 total runoff ranged from 99 2 to 567 95 mm period 1 in the first rainy season and from 25 13 to 387 75 mm period 1 in the second rainy season the analysis of variance of total runoff showed that soil management systems significantly impacted water loss by runoff in both periods p 0 05 in the first period the treatment based on olive associated with spontaneous vegetation osv recorded the lowest water loss with 99 2 mm period 1 of total runoff in the second rainy season the treatment of olive associated with cover crops presented lower value of total runoff ojb showed the lowest water losses of 25 13 mm period 1 followed by osh with 30 02 mm period 1 and osv with 37 68 mm period 1 runoff coefficient showed the same behavior as total runoff with significant differences among treatments in both periods p 0 05 for both periods treatments bs and obs were significantly different from other treatment based on cover crops however runoff coefficient in bs and obs ranged from 0 44 to 0 48 in other words approximately more than half of the rainfall received in the plots was direct lost by runoff runoff coefficient for treatment with cover crops showed the following order ojb 0 23 omi 0 14 and osv 0 09 in the first period and the following order in the second period osv 0 04 osh 0 03 ojb 0 03 the relationship between the erosivity and soil loss presented a positive correlation being a more prominent correlation for bs and obs treatments with correlation coefficients and coefficients of determination greater than 0 90 for both periods table 4 3 4 soil chemical properties soil chemical properties for the two periods under different management systems are presented in table 5 and tables s1 and s2 supplementary material there was high variability among treatments and depths regarding different chemical properties in the first rainy season of 2015 2016 no significant differences were observed comparing the effect of different treatments in all depths in the following chemical properties mg al h al and m however a significant effect was observed in ph k content and soil organic matter som in the second rainy season 2016 2017 the significant effect of cover crops appears on the following characteristics ph k mg al h al v and som regarding the som generally this property presented a low level in bs and obs treatments soil properties with significant differences among both periods are shown in fig 4 topsoil layer depth 0 5 cm was more sensitive to variations as compared to soil samples of other depths potential acidity h al showed a significant variation for treatment ojb at depth 0 5 cm and no effect was observed in the depths bellow fig 4 a regarding soil ph a significant variation of 8 was measured in depth 0 5 cm for treatment ojb and a decrease of this property for the rest of the treatments soil ph at depths 5 10 cm and 10 20 cm also presented lower values through time being computed a significant difference for treatment bs fig 4 b significant differences were computed regarding soil organic matter som at depth 0 5 cm a significant increase of 20 in som was measured for treatment ojb meanwhile a significant decrease of 2 for treatment bs the other depths presented no significant differences among them for som fig 4 c base saturation followed the same trend of ph presenting only significant differences at the topsoil layer 0 5 cm fig 4 d 3 5 soil physical properties bulk density bd showed high variability at the different depths for both studied seasons table 6 although there are no signs of soil compaction during the two studied periods treatments bs and obs presented similar trends in the first period at depth of 0 20 cm there were no computed significant differences among treatments for depths 20 40 and 40 60 cm bs and obs treatment were consistently grouped in the same statistical group p value 0 05 overall total porosity tp macroporosity map and microporosity mip presented the same pattern among treatments and depths with no significant effect for the studied periods the highest values of tp and map were observed at treatments osv and ojb and the lowest values in plots with treatment bs the effect is clear in the deeper layers by decreasing the porosity as was reported by palese et al 2014 cover crops promoted positively tp regarding the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks and soil aggregate stability no significant impact was recorded among treatments during the experiment at different depths for its low relevance the results of ks and soil aggregate stability are not presented in this study hydraulic conductivity classification soil survey staff 2014 for the first rainy season presented moderate permeability for soils under osv and omi whereas soils under other treatments showed moderately high permeability for the second rainy season treatments indeed modified the soil hydraulic classification moderate permeability for treatments obs and bs and moderately high for the rest of the assessed treatments 3 6 relating soil properties and water erosion table 7 presents the pearson correlation coefficients for the different studied variables these results concurred with the aforementioned findings tables 4 5 and 6 the soil loss sl had a positive and significant correlation with water loss 0 89 and aluminum 0 44 and a negative correlation with ph 0 69 and exchangeable k 0 50 regarding the water loss wl it had a negative correlation with ph 0 56 exchangeable k 0 43 wad 0 38 and gad 0 39 the results of the nmds performed to analyze the soil management system differentiation among soil erosion plots with the ordination of each soil properties among treatment unit year combinations as well soil and water losses are shown in fig 5a the two dimensional 2d nmds solution was representative indicating the usefulness of the ordination approach for extracting structure patterns from the experimental data final stress of the ordination was 0 069 after 20 iterations nmds showed that the bs treatments was more associated with high total runoff and water losses due to plot with bare soil and olive associated with bare soil presented the higher rate of soil and water erosion these treatments were arrayed to the left on nmds axis 1 according to both time cycles the 2016 2017 time cycles olive associated with sunn hemp olive associated with spontaneous vegetation and olive associated with jack bean plots were arrayed further to the right on nmds axis 1 nmds ordination analysis allowed to classify the pattern and performance of each treatment and soil properties however treatments with higher rate of soil and water erosion bare soil and olive planted in bare soil were associated with lower value of soil aggregate stability and soil ph fig 5b c cover crops impact became more evident for the second rainy season cover crops contributed to improve soil properties soil aggregate stability improved under treatments osv and ojb in addition it was observed a significant impact of cover crops in the reduction of soil acidification and the buffering capacity of the soil soil physical and chemical properties are influenced by soil management systems which can be observed by the effect of different treatments in the evolution of various soil properties 4 discussion 4 1 rainfall erosivity the region of study is at high risk for water erosion and soil loss due to its high rainfall erosivity particularly during the rainy season from november to february as well as agricultural management practices beniaich et al 2020 this has been previously reported by several studies aquino et al 2014 lima et al 2018 silva et al 2005 the values of total rainfall erosivity for the same period reported in this study are well aligned to those observed by lima et al 2018 ranged between 4050 and 8384 mj mm ha 1 h 1 period 1 4 2 soil and water losses by erosion high soil losses during november december and january of the first rainy season 2015 2016 can be explained by the high rainfall erosivity during these months 2275 mj mm ha 1 h 1 period 1 as compared to 1330 mj mm ha 1 h 1 period 1 for the second rainy season and by the soil disturbance caused by the operations of olive plantation and the seeding of cover crops during the first rainy season overall the pattern of rainfall is the main factor controlling the erosion particularly evident in treatments with bare soil bs and obs as the results showed i e strong correlation between soil loss and erosivity table 4 these results are in accordance with what has been reported in the literature regarding soil erosion being controlled by other factors such as precedent soil moisture soil cover and soil crusting lópez vicente et al 2022 poesen 1986 ramos and martínez casasnovas 2006 rodrigo comino et al 2018a zuazo et al 2009 the impact of cover crops on reducing water erosion was significant for treatments ojb and osv as results for soil losses showed in plots with treatments bs and obs we noted in different field observations the formation of soil crusts and sealing of the soil pores caused by the disruption of soil aggregates and dispersion of fine soil minerals poesen 1986 variation in soil erosion under different cover crop systems could be associated to the interaction between the plants themselves and the soil the crop capacity to explore soil and the growth of its root system promotes water infiltration the binding of soil particles and soil aggregation celette et al 2008 lópez vicente et al 2022 evaluated the effectiveness of a mixed ground cover temporary seeded cover crop and spontaneous vegetation in reducing the loss of soil nutrients by erosion observed an 8 3 times higher nutrient loss in soil with a lower percent of ground cover regarding the comparison between the studied cover crops no significant differences were observed among periods however osv and obj tended to present a higher efficiency in the reduction of soil and water loss cardoso et al 2013 reported that sunn hemp legume and millet cereal have a quick growth and a dense root system compared to jack bean legume in this studied region but jack bean is characterized by long duration crop cycle as compared to the other cover crops the latter physiological characteristic of jack bean allowed soil under treatment ojb to remain protected for a longer period as compared to the other treatments similarly spontaneous vegetation as a cover crop reduced soil erosion for both studied periods the high rate growth of brachiaria favored a homogeneous distribution of the vegetation in the plots additionally it was highly capable to adapt and regenerate from season to season despite the operations weed removal and soil preparation during experimental setup the highest water losses can be explained by the low cover vegetation index during the first year post plantation as it was observed in a previous study beniaich et al 2022 in addition the age of the main crop could also affect our results since young orchard olive trees present canopy and root systems not fully formed runoff coefficients were 6 15 times higher on plots with treatment bs as compared to plots with other treatments with consorted cover crops according to rodrigo comino et al 2018 the ratio between runoff coefficients of bare soil plots to plots with cover crops in olive orchards can reach up to 50 runoff coefficients reported by zuazo et al 2011 in olive orchards with spontaneous vegetation in mediterranean climate deferred to the results we computed this high variability in runoff coefficients in the literature may be associated to climatic conditions lima et al 2018 rodrigo comino et al 2018b as well as soil management systems and soil properties 4 3 soil properties and water erosion the results showed that some soil properties proved to be more sensitive to water erosion according to the results during the two hydrological years of field evaluation in an inceptisol susceptible to water erosion fig 5 the properties related to ph and soil organic matter presented a significant effect under different treatments the impact of cover crops was observed as increased soil organic matter content in the topsoil layer in accordance to results reported by repullo ruibérriz de torres et al 2021 however our results showed a significant increase of som for treatments osv and ojb up to 20 increase compared to the first period thus it was in the topsoil layer where there was a significant effect of management systems due to the accumulation of fresh plant derived carbon poffenbarger et al 2020 regarding the ph evaluation in this study we observed the correlation of the high rates of the erosion associated to treatments bs and obs and the soil acidification positive and the ph negative that can be explained by the loss of soil buffering capacity as a consequence of the loss of soil organic matter and clay particles várallya 1989 soil physical properties were also affected by the loss of som in plots with high erosion rates soil crusting was evident and som contents dropped this was also measured as diminished soil aggregate stability som is a cementation agent between mineral particles and other organic materials present in the soil matrix therefore when rainfall water breaks down soil aggregates fine soil particles are transported together with organic materials bronick and lal 2005 the role of som in improving soil physical properties appeared during the observations and measurements for the second year of the experiment increased hydraulic conductivity and reduced soil bulk density silva et al 2021 found that ecological intensification of cropping systems increased soil cover rate reduced soil water and nutrient losses and these correlated well with enhanced soil structure and increased grain yield evaluation of the impact of cover crops on chemical and physical properties of the soil can be considered as an efficient tool for the monitoring of the soil management systems and further study will allow understanding olive orchard ecosystems in addition other characteristics must be approached considering different processes and interaction in these systems such as the evaluation of soil indicators gómez and soriano 2020 the biological impact of cover crops castellano hinojosa and strauss 2020 the effects of cover crops on multiple ecosystem services shackelford et al 2019 and the integration of socio economical approaches rodríguez sousa et al 2019 in orchards similar results were obtained by palese et al 2014 regarding the difference in soil bulk density between treatments in olive orchard when comparing sustainable and conventional management systems low values of soil bulk density were reported for sustainable systems plots covered by spontaneous grasses soil bulk density decreases are caused by increased soil organic content root exudates and vegetation residues together with undisturbed fauna driving soil porosity up keesstra et al 2016 regarding soil porosity total porosity macroporosity and microporosity for treatments osv and ojb tended to show increases of these physical properties result of nmds presented a good performance with a final stress of 0 069 allowing to classy the treatments in three groups first group constituted by treatments bs and obs unsustainable treatments characterized by high rate of soil and water loss by water erosion low soil aggregation high al content second formed by the treatment omi and osh presented a transition group between the first and the second with high variability on studied soil properties third group constituted by osv and ojb sustainable treatments that presented low soil and water loss by water erosion and high soil aggregation high som and low ph fig 5 the use of cover crops in olive orchards showed the beneficial impacts that consorted vegetation can provide towards protecting the soil against water erosion and as a result improve soil properties according to studies conducted by guimarães et al 2021 the results showed that maintaining intercropped spontaneous vegetation at olive plantations allowed to improve the soil carbon stock and it reduced nutrient and carbon losses the results of this work are in accordance to other studies presenting the elimination of spontaneous vegetation in olive orchards as an unsustainable management system keesstra et al 2016 thus usage of spontaneous vegetation as cover crop is a good alternative to reduce soil and water erosion to increase som content and to improve soil properties 5 conclusions we tested the hypothesis that cover crops could reduce soil erosion and improve soil health in the early years after planting olive orchards inter row areas of the orchard with bare soil had higher rates of soil erosion as compared to areas with cover crops soil management systems with intercropped cover crops effectively controlled water erosion and improved soil health relating the impact of cover crops on soil properties we observed a significant impact of cover crops in the reduction of soil acidification and increased contents of soil organic matter soil physical and chemical properties were influenced by soil management systems and the use of spontaneous vegetation as a cover crop promoted the improvement of soil properties in these early years of olive plantation based on the results of this work it is recommended to use spontaneous vegetation as a cover crop in olive plantations at least during the first rainy season this proved to reduce soil and water losses for subsequent years a combination or a transition of other cover crops is possible since soil losses for treatments ojb 0 41 mg ha 1 period 1 and osv 0 55 mg ha 1 period 1 were statistically grouped using nmds with a good performance final stress 0 069 this decision between a spontaneous vegetation or a profitable cover crop should be adopted by farmers considering monetary costs and to prevent any sort of affection of the main crop declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

introduction irrigation is necessary to maintain crop production in water limited areas such as the southern high plains shp of the us for instance the lubbock region of the shp receives 80 85 rainfall during april october which is the primary cropping season texas a m agrilife extension 2022 the average rainfall and evapotranspiration during this period are 388 mm and 1137 mm respectively fig a 1 the supplemental irrigation water required to meet the crop evapotranspiration demand is pumped out of the ogallala aquifer which is the main groundwater source in the shp the declining groundwater levels in the ogallala aquifer can limit crop production in this semi arid region as water restriction policies are expected to be stricter in the near future bian 2015 therefore agronomic strategies for increasing the water productivity wp of the current production systems are imperative for sustaining irrigated agriculture in the shp deficit irrigation di has proved to be a promising approach for increasing the wp of various crops including wheat triticum aestivum l xu et al 2018 yu et al 2020 maize zea mays l attia et al 2021 di paolo and rinaldi 2008 cotton gossypium hirsutum l

modification is a crucial mechanism to counter drought stress farooq et al 2009 moisture stress under di may increase root growth enabling plants to mine water from deeper soil layers pace et al 1999 xu et al 2016 conversely severe moisture deficit increases soil mechanical resistance sharma et al 2014 resulting in a compacted layer that can impede root growth and elongation hodgkinson et al 2017 unger and kaspar 1994 plant root responses to water stress can differ among crop species with respect to crop management guan et al 2015 soil types bengough et al 2006 sharma et al 2017 and climatic

et al 2008 gheysari et al 2017 or no effect of di on root growth benjamin and nielsen 2006 parkash et al 2021b it should be noted that root adaptions among plants vary largely depending on the level of moisture stress ali et al 2019 rao et al 2016 sampathkumar et al 2012 to better understand the aboveground adaptions of a crop to different moisture stress levels it is essential to examine the belowground root adjustments the di is often accompanied by yield losses especially in water sensitive crops with shallow root systems such as sweet corn zea mays l var rugosa oktem 2008a singh et al 2019 however it is evident that plants can adapt to moderate water stress thereby increasing the wp with minimal yield losses parkash et al 2021a singh et al 2022 combining di with appropriate soil management practices may help to close the yield gaps relative to full irrigation biochar a carbon rich co product of pyrolysis of organic matter is known to improve soil properties although the biochar effect on soil varies intensely with soil texture feedstock and pyrolysis temperature its application generally increases soil porosity water retention and plant available water and decreases soil bulk density and tensile strength blanco canqui 2017 razzaghi et al 2020 previous reports have indicated the potential of biochar to alleviate negative effect of water stress on crop yields agbna et al 2017 langeroodi et al 2019 singh et al 2019 however crop root distribution and soil water depletion under integrated use of di strategies and biochar application are poorly understood we are hypothesizing that by improving soil structural properties and reducing soil compaction biochar may improve root growth and water extraction abilities of plants which can be important under water deficit conditions therefore the main objectives of this research were to i assess the effect of di and biochar application on the root distribution of sweet corn ii determine the water depletion patterns and wp of sweet corn in biochar amended soils under deficit irrigation 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description field experiments were conducted at quaker research farm texas tech

water content at the beginning of the stage the change in water storage in soil profile over the growing season was calculated by subtracting the soil water content at harvest from the initial soil water content 2 3 2 root sampling and analysis a stainless steel split core sampler was used to collect undisturbed soil core samples at the harvest maturity stage the samples were taken from the center of each plot at 3 5 cm distance from the base of plant perpendicular to the plant row two 30 cm split core sampler cup sets 5 cm diameter were connected with a coupler to give a 60 cm long split core sampler ams american falls id usa samples were collected down to 60 cm soil depth corresponding to the length of the sampler and diameter of 5 cm the split core sampler was pushed into the soil using a 14 kg heavy duty slide hammer and taken out with a hi lift jack an undisturbed 60 cm soil core sample was cut lengthwise at 10 cm incremental layers to analyze the root parameters separately at six soil depths each of these soil samples were stored in labeled ziploc polyethylene at 20 c before washing to separate roots for washing soil samples were placed on the first mesh strainer of the stack another finer mesh strainer was directly held beneath the first strainer to retain smaller root fragments passing through the top mesh water was sprinkled over the top strainer

irrigation biochar and combination of irrigation and biochar treatments were treated as fixed effects replications combination of replications with irrigation treatments and combination of replications with biochar treatments were treated as random effects root and soil water depletion data was first analyzed considering irrigation biochar and soil depth as fixed effects analyzes of variance were then performed with irrigation and biochar as fixed effects at each depth mean separation and pairwise comparisons were done using a sas macro pdmix800 saxton 1998 3 results and discussion this study investigated the integrated effect of di and biochar application on root growth soil water distribution and depletion yield and wp of sweet corn the results suggested that the interaction between irrigation and biochar for root parameters swd crop water use yield parameters and wp were mostly non significant the di had a significant effect on all the measured parameters and biochar affected the root parameters significantly therefore the results are discussed with emphasis on the main treatment effects 3 1 irrigation and weather conditions the weather conditions during the 2019 and 2020 growing seasons are presented in fig 1 the average maximum and minimum temperatures were warmer in 2020 than 2019 resulting in greater total reference evapotranspiration of 709 mm in 2020 compared to 634 mm in 2019 the total irrigation amounts and rainfall received during 2019 and 2020 growing seasons are given in table 1 the rainfall contributed 45 and 20 of total water applied to 100 etc treatment during 2019 and 2020 respectively in 2019 69 of rainfall occurred within 0 30 dap fig 1 the 100 etc received 160 mm higher supplemental irrigation in 2020 than in 2019 growing season the crop accumulated 1260 heat units in 2019 compared to 1524 in 2020 fig 1 in 2020 the 55 65 dap period was exceptionally hot and dry with average relative humidity reaching as low as 22 and maximum temperature as high as 43 c at 60 dap this period coincided with the reproductive stage of sweet corn adversely affecting kernel formation high temperatures during anthesis inhibit pollen viability and germination causing kernel abortion li and howell 2021 empty kernels in many ears reduced the yield substantially in 2020 compared to 2019 the yield results are given in more detail in section 3 5 3 2 soil water content differences in the vwc before the onset of di treatments were observed among the irrigation zones especially in 2019 where 40 etc plots recorded higher initial vwc within the 20 40 cm soil depths fig 2 these differences due to heterogenous distribution of water contents in different treatment plots are mostly unavoidable under field conditions fluctuations in vwc were greater within the 0 40 cm soil depths indicating the primary root water uptake layer hence soil water conditions within this layer 0 40 cm were more critical than the maximum root zone depth of 100 cm to help maintain the optimum rate of root water uptake under di irrigated sweet corn systems at 60 cm soil depth vwc remained more or less stable until about 45 dap during both years after that vwc dropped under 40 etc while increasing under 100 and 70 etc towards the end of the growing season this suggests that crops under 40 etc utilized the available soil water at 60 cm depth while soil water was stored in 100 and 70 etc treatments vwc at 100 cm depth remained relatively stable and similar among di treatments except for the initial differences vwc remained similar among di treatments until about 40 dap in the 0 40 cm soil depths after that vwc dropped in 70 and 40 etc compared to 100 etc during both years vwc was mostly highest in 100 etc followed by 70 and 40 etc except in the 20 40 cm soil depths in 2019 where 40 etc recorded greater vwc than 70 etc higher temperature and evaporative demands in 2020 caused greater fluctuations in vwc compared to 2019 growing season in 2020 at 60dap vwc dropped to 48 44 and 32 of the field capacity water content in 100 70 and 40 etc plots respectively within the upper 0 10 cm depths the biochar treatments did not impact vwc in the soil profile much during both years fig 2 biochar has been reported to improve the water retention capacity of soil by improving the soil physical properties razzaghi et al 2020 our results indicated a 3 decrease in bulk density and a 3 increase in porosity of sandy loam by 13 mg ha 1 hardwood biochar singh et al 2022 there were corresponding increase in saturated water content of soil without affecting the field capacity water content permanent wilting point and plant available water razzaghi et al 2020 reported that the biochar effects on soil physical properties and water retention are less pronounced in medium textured soils compared to coarse soils higher hardwood biochar rates may be required to alter the water retention of sandy loam soil in the region phillips et al 2020 also reported an increase in soil porosity water content at saturation with conifer wood and wheat straw biochar 9 36 t ha 1 but no effect on water content at field capacity 3 3 root distribution root distribution varies greatly with variation in moisture content in the soil profile chen et al 2018 gao et al 2014 simultaneously soil water availability to a crop greatly depends on root distribution bengough et al 2011 di had a significant p 0 05 effect on rld in 2019 but no effect was observed in 2020 table 2 in 2019 compared to 100 etc 70 etc increased rld by 20 while 40 etc decreased the rld by 23 analyzes of rld for different root diameter classes indicated that fine roots 0 0 5 mm accounted for 87 medium roots 0 5 2 mm 10 13 while coarse roots 2 mm were an insignificant proportion of total root length fig 3 the increase in rld under 70 etc in 2019 was mainly attributed to the increase in fine root length fig 3 as a result avd in 70 etc was reduced compared to 100 etc fig 4 however avd in 40 etc was statistically similar to 100 etc differences among treatments were observed for fine rld while medium rld remained comparable among treatments fig 3 crops adjust to mild water stress by allocating more resources to root growth jupp and newman 1987 sharp and davies 1979 while extreme water stress can decrease the root growth and penetration by causing mechanical impedance bengough et al 2006 2011 vandoorne et al 2012 the rld patterns observed among di treatments in our study are in agreement with kang et al 2000 who reported 20 increase in root biomass of maize at medium water deficit 50 65 of field capacity and 34 reduction in root biomass at severe water stress 40 55 of field capacity compared to well watered treatment 60 85 of field capacity sampathkumar et al 2012 also reported increased root growth under mild water deficit while lower root growth under severe water deficit in drip irrigated maize interactions among di treatments for rld across different soil depths were significant p 0 001 in 2019 table 2 analyzes of rld at different depths revealed an increase in rld for 70 etc at 0 30 cm soil depths while a decrease in rld for 40 etc at 0 40 cm compared to 100 etc fig 5 the rld at 40 60 cm depths did not differ significantly among the di treatments although the vmc below 40 cm soil depth was lower for 70 and 40 etc di treatments compared to 100 etc after mid season it remained well above field capacity fig 2 this suggests that water was not a limiting factor in deeper soil layers that might have resulted in similar root growth for di treatments rld distribution patterns across different soil depths under different irrigation treatments have yielded contrasting results in previous studies for various crops for instance contrary to our study xu et al 2018 reported a decline in rld in the upper soil layers 0 40 cm and an increase in rld in deeper layers 40 160 cm under limited irrigation compared to sufficient irrigation treatment in wheat flynn et al 2021 reported an increase in maturation root density of maize subjected to 40 and 65 of etc compared to 100 et in the entire 60 cm soil profile root growth results in 2020 were inconsistent with 2019 as no difference in rld was observed among irrigation treatments at all soil depths although 70 etc recorded the highest rld in 2020 it was not statistically different from 100 or 40 etc heat stress during the reproductive stage caused kernel abortion resulting in greater biomass allocation towards vegetative parts this effect was more obvious in 40 etc where heat stress was accompanied by severe water stress this may have resulted in greater root growth for 40 etc treatment in 2020 relative to 2019 these seasonal discrepancies in root distribution of crops due to varied weather conditions have been highlighted in some previous studies sharma et al 2017 zhang et al 2009 biochar effect on rld was non significant in 2019 but significant p 0 01 in 2020 table 2 hardwood biochar recorded the highest rld during both years followed by softwood and no biochar fig 3 hardwood biochar increased rld by 9 5 and 27 over no biochar treatment in 2019 and 2020 respectively organic amendments such as biochar can promote root growth by improving soil physiochemical properties bruun et al 2014 xiang et al 2017 xiao et al 2016 zhao et al 2018 bruun et al 2014 reported a 5 7 decrease in bulk density of sandy soil and a significant increase in root density of barley hordeum vulgare l with 2 hardwood biochar application in a laboratory column experiment we observed a 3 9 increase in soil porosity and a 4 decrease in bulk density with hardwood biochar application in the experimental field singh et al 2022 which may have influenced the root growth the softwood biochar had no effect on these soil physical properties and did not significantly affect the root growth the differences in rld among biochar treatments were significant only at 40 50 cm depth in 2020 where hardwood gave significantly higher rld than no biochar fig 5 in 2020 both hardwood and softwood biochar increased rld significantly over no biochar at 0 10 cm soil depth while at 10 20 cm depth hardwood amended soils gave higher rld compared to softwood and no biochar there were no differences in rld among biochar treatments at 20 60 cm depth this could largely be attributed to the fact that biochar was incorporated to a depth of about upper 15 cm in the soil rsad followed a similar pattern as rld for irrigation and biochar treatments during both years fig a 2 except rsad for 70 etc remained comparable to 100 etc at all soil depths during 2019 all measured root parameters varied significantly with soil depth table 2 the rld decreased towards deeper soil layers and was highest at 0 10 cm depth in 2019 and 10 20 cm depth in 2020 table a 1 of the total root length measured in the 0 60 cm soil profile 80 and 73 occurred within 0 30 cm depths in 2019 and 2020 respectively yu et al 2007 recorded 75 rld of maize within the 0 30 cm soil profile with the highest fraction at 0 10 cm soil depth the decline in rld towards deeper soil layers is well documented in many crops under unrestricted field conditions gao et al 2014 guan et al 2015 man et al 2016 yu et al 2007 under sub surface drip irrigation the root system is confined near the dripper reducing deeper root growth sampathkumar et al 2012 3 4 soil water depletion the irrigation and biochar interactions for swd were non significant in both years except for the early growth stage in 2020 table 1 irrigation treatments significantly affected the mid late and total swd during both years the swd at the early stage was comparable among irrigation treatments because all irrigation treatments received an approximately equal amount of water during this period the overall swd was highest in 40 etc followed by 70 and 100 etc treatments table 1 hao et al 2015 also reported greater soil water extraction at 50 etc compared to 100 and 75 etc by maize in a semi arid environment on the texas high plains although the 2020 growing season received greater supplemental irrigation the overall swd was greater in 2020 than in 2019 most likely due to environmental stress resulting from lower rainfall higher temperature and lower humidity greater swd occurred during the mid growth stage compared to early and late growth stages during both years table 1 these results were similar to the findings of pabuayon et al 2019 who reported maximum water extraction in cotton sesame sesamum indicum l and sorghum sorghum bicolor l during the mid season contrarily bhattarai et al 2020 reported greater swd during the early growth stage compared to the mid and late growth stages heavy rainfall during the early season in 2019 resulted in water storage in the soil profile apparently this stored water was utilized during the mid season during the late growth stage water storage occurred in the soil profile in both years even under 40 etc indicating that the crop did not utilize all of the supplied water it may be due to the lower water requirement of sweet corn towards maturity notably this suggests that the crop was over irrigated during this late growth stage especially in 100 etc treatment the rainfall events from 75 to 80 dap also contributed to water storage in 2020 the 100 and 70 etc recorded 34 7 mm and 22 mm water storage in the 2019 growing season and 7 7 mm and 0 3 mm water storage in 2020 within the 100 cm soil profile table 1 the 40 etc treatment recorded 0 23 mm and 41 8 mm water depletion in 2019 and 2020 respectively fig 6 compares the swd among irrigation treatments at different soil depths within 100 cm soil profile during early mid and late growth stages of sweet corn the swd was highest at 40 etc followed by 70 and 100 etc at almost all soil depths during both years with few exceptions the swd during the early growth stage did not differ significantly among irrigation treatments at almost all soil depths in both years during the mid growth stage the 40 etc increased the swd significantly over 100 etc within the 10 60 cm soil profile in 2019 and 20 60 cm in 2020 the 70 etc recorded significantly greater swd over 100 etc at 20 and 40 cm depths in 2019 and at 20 and 60 cm depth in 2020 during the mid growth stage during the late growth stage in 2019 the swd under 40 etc treatment was significantly higher than 100 etc at 10 and 60 cm depth whereas at 100 cm depth 70 etc recorded significantly greater swd than 40 and 100 etc treatments although we did not measure root growth at 100 cm depth increased swd for 70 etc at this depth might relate partly to greater root water uptake in 2020 the 40 increased the late stage swd over 100 etc at all soil depths the 40 etc recorded relatively greater swd from 40 100 cm soil profile compared to upper layers 0 40 cm during the late growth stage in both years the swd during the growing season was substantially higher in 40 etc than 100 etc at all soil depths in both years hence sweet corn roots under deficit irrigation practices might compensate for water stress in one part of the root zone by taking up water from less stressed parts of the root zone resulting in higher swd in the soil profile the 70 etc increased the total swd over 100 etc significantly at 30 cm and 60 cm depths in 2019 and 20 cm and 60 depths in 2020 in 2019 seasonal swd was greater in the upper soil profile 0 30 cm whereas in 2020 swd was greater in the 30 100 cm soil profile especially for 40 etc treatment this could be explained by greater rld in deeper soil layers 30 60 cm in 2020 27 of total rld values relative to 2019 20 of total also the overall greater swd in 2020 likely prevented the water percolation below the root zone datta et al 2022 recorded 75 water extraction from 0 to 30 cm soil depths in a 0 45 cm soil profile since 70 80 of sweet corn roots occurred in 0 30 cm soil depth a greater proportion of root water uptake was expected to occur within this region of the root zone however as mentioned earlier plants under water deficit conditions may respond to non uniform water stress in the root zone reduced water uptake in upper soil depths may be balanced by enhanced uptake from less water stressed deeper depths which results in increased root growth in deeper soil layers sharma et al 2017 xu et al 2016 our results did not show increased rld in deeper soil profile but the swd increased substantially from deeper soil layers in case of di treatments 70 and 40 etc relative to 100 etc along with root water uptake upward water movement due to capillary action and lesser water percolation to deeper layers during irrigation rainfall events could have resulted in greater swd for di treatments in deeper layers jha et al 2017 li et al 2010 biochar treatments did not significantly affect swd except at mid stage in 2019 when both hardwood and softwood biochar treatments recorded significantly greater swd than no biochar treatment table 1 analyzes of biochar effect on swd at different soil depths indicated a significant increase in swd for hardwood biochar treatment compared to no biochar at 60 cm soil depth during mid stage in 2019 fig a 3 the increased swd corresponded with greater rld for hardwood biochar compared to no biochar at 40 50 cm soil depth fig 5 however the total swd over the 2019 growing season did not differ significantly among biochar treatments at all depths within the 100 cm soil profile fig a 3 unlike our findings faloye et al 2019 reported a reduction in swd in maize caused by an improvement in soil hydro physical properties with the application of 20 t ha 1 maize cob residue biochar although hardwood biochar increased rld over no biochar at 0 20 cm depth in 2020 it did not affect swd at this depth generally evaporation of water from the soil surface in both bare during initial period of the growing season and under canopy during different growth stages soils can also account for a substantial proportion of soil water depletion in the topsoil layer i e 0 20 cm especially under semi arid environments liu et al 2002 estimated that evaporation took up 30 3 of the total evapotranspiration in maize majority of which occurs from upper soil layers the continuous measurement of soil water balance components especially evaporation and deep percolation was not made therefore measured variations of volumetric water contents alone could not provide information whether water was taken up by crops or lost from the root zone via evaporation or deep percolation apparently it was not well understood whether the increased rld contributed to an enhanced root water uptake increased rld in the upper soil profile might not increase the root water uptake zhang et al 2009 as reported in our previous publication singh et al 2022 biochar application had no effect on stomatal conductance transpiration and photosynthesis of sweet corn this indicates that the increased rld in the upper soil profile due to hardwood biochar application most likely did not increase root water uptake 3 5 crop water use yield and water productivity biochar application has been reported to alleviate the negative effect of water stress on crops and improve the wp alkhasha et al 2019 kangoma et al 2017 singh et al 2019 however our results showed that the interaction between irrigation and biochar treatments for etc act yield and wpyield biomass were non significant during both years table 3 however irrigation treatments had a significant influence on the above mentioned parameters biochar treatments did not affect these parameters significantly though hardwood biochar gave slightly higher yield and wpyield biomass than no biochar during both seasons faloye et al 2019 also observed non significant interaction between irrigation and biochar on maize yield and water use efficiency but 20 t ha 1 maize cob residue biochar application increased water use efficiency under all irrigation treatments our results partially agree with ramlow et al 2019 who reported an improvement in water retention with 25 t ha 1 pine biochar application without alleviating the negative effect of water stress on maize yield in this study hardwood biochar decreased the soil bulk density and increased soil porosity with a minimal effect on soil water retention therefore the effect on physical properties due biochar did not translate into plant yield and wp the hardwood and softwood biochar used in this study contain 63 and 88 carbon respectively one of the concerns about adding biochar to the agricultural soils is that high amount carbon incorporated with biochar may cause nitrogen immobilization by microbes some researchers have reported restricted plant growth and reduced yields with biochar application due n immobilization deenik et al 2010 liu et al 2017 however we did not observe any adverse effect on plant growth and yield during 2 years of study due biochar application interestingly hardwood increased the plant height and vegetative dry biomass sweet corn as reported in singh et al 2022 some of these positive effects of hardwood biochar especially during second year after application indicates that its effects on soil properties and plant growth need to be studies beyond 2 years while higher application rates may result in greater benefits they may not be a viable option for the farmers until locally produced biochar is available at cheaper prices compared to 100 etc 70 and 40 etc treatments reduced the etc act by 50 and 140 mm in 2019 and 82 and 155 mm in 2020 reduction in etc act did not have adverse effect on yield for 70 etc treatment the fresh ear yield was comparable between 100 and 70 etc treatments during both years the increase in stored soil moisture use under 40 etc fig 6 was not enough to maintain a high yield the 40 etc reduced the fresh ear yield by 17 in 2019 and 44 in 2020 compared to 100 etc our results were comparable to ertek and kara 2013 who observed a 4 reduction in sweet corn yield by applying 70 of full irrigation and a significant reduction of 24 in yield by applying 40 of full irrigation contrarily oktem 2008b reported a 39 yield reduction applying irrigation based on 70 class a pan evaporation compared to 100 these discrepancies in yield responses to di due to variations in genotypes weather conditions soil type irrigation systems irrigation timings etc are common and highlighted previously in literature cheng et al 2021 singh et al 2021a the fresh ear yield obtained in 2019 was 1 8 times that of 2020 in 2020 heat stress during silking stage adversely affected the kernel formation producing many ears with numerous empty kernels this caused greater biomass allocation to vegetative parts and reduced the harvest index substantially in 2020 compared to 2019 table 3 a similar adverse effect of heat stress on maize kernel formation and yield has been reported previously bakhtavar et al 2015 li and howell 2021 and particularly observed in other maize trials carried out in the area during 2020 season singh et al 2021b at 40 etc heat stress was combined with severe water stress resulting in greater negative impact on kernel formation the irrigation treatments had no effect on the harvest index in 2019 but it dropped drastically under 40 etc in 2020 table 3 the 70 etc increased the wpyield by 23 and 17 over 100 etc in 2019 and 2020 respectively the 40 etc increased the wpyield over 100 etc by 25 in 2019 but reduced by 18 in 2020 although the overall aboveground dry biomass production across treatments in 2020 was 27 higher than 2019 singh et al 2022 due to higher cumulative heat units and water use the overall wpbiomoss was only 7 higher in 2020 than 2019 both 70 and 40 etc treatments increased wpbiomoss significantly over 100 etc in 2019 while it remained comparable among irrigations in 2020 ertek and kara 2013 suggested that 70 etc can be a water saving strategy for sweet corn with minimal reduction in yield based on 4 year field trials in the us high plains trout and dejonge 2017 concluded that the water productivity of maize peaked at 75 etc and declined with further reduction in irrigation amount due to a rapid decline in yield hao et al 2015 also observed a 3 increase in water use efficiency at 75 etc and a drastic decline of 28 in water use efficiency at 50 etc irrigation for maize production in texas high plains 4 conclusion the 70 etc adjusted to water deficit by increasing root growth and stored soil water extraction from 100 cm soil profile averaged across two years 70 etc improved the wpyield by 21 over 100 etc without any significant reduction in yield the 40 etc increased the stored swd but it had a negative effect on root growth considering the yield losses and conflicting wpyield results at 40 etc during the two seasons 40 etc may not be a viable option for sweet corn production in a semi arid environment the soil water storage at the late growth stage during both years suggests that higher water restrictions can be investigated and adopted towards maturity biochar did not show any interactive effects with irrigation treatments within two years after application hardwood biochar increased the root growth in 0 20 cm soil profile without altering the swd yield and wp of sweet corn long term trials are suggested to test biochar effects under limited irrigation beyond two years the 70 etc can be recommended as an alternative water saving

9057,root modifications can play a vital role in crop adjustments to soil water deficit it is important to understand root growth and soil water depletion patterns to develop effective cropping systems especially in semi arid regions like texas high plains thp this study evaluated root growth soil water depletion and water productivity wp of sweet corn under three deficit irrigation treatments 100 70 and 40 crop evapotranspiration etc and biochar application hardwood and softwood the experimental units were replicated 4 times in a split plot design the results revealed no interaction between irrigation and biochar treatments for almost all measured parameters the 70 etc treatment increased the root length density rld over 100 etc during 2019 while no differences were observed among irrigation treatments in 2020 both deficit irrigations 70 and 40 etc increased soil water depletion compared to 100 etc the highest being in 40 etc the 70 etc maintained a similar yield and increased wp by 21 compared to 100 etc across two years however 40 etc resulted in significant decline in yield and wp in 2020 the hardwood biochar increased rld over no biochar treatment without affecting the soil water status and wp long term studies are needed to investigate biochar effects beyond two years of application in case of limited water availability 70 etc can be recommended as an alternative to 100 etc in the thp of the us keywords soil water content drought stress semi arid evapotranspiration root length density data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction irrigation is necessary to maintain crop production in water limited areas such as the southern high plains shp of the us for instance the lubbock region of the shp receives 80 85 rainfall during april october which is the primary cropping season texas a m agrilife extension 2022 the average rainfall and evapotranspiration during this period are 388 mm and 1137 mm respectively fig a 1 the supplemental irrigation water required to meet the crop evapotranspiration demand is pumped out of the ogallala aquifer which is the main groundwater source in the shp the declining groundwater levels in the ogallala aquifer can limit crop production in this semi arid region as water restriction policies are expected to be stricter in the near future bian 2015 therefore agronomic strategies for increasing the water productivity wp of the current production systems are imperative for sustaining irrigated agriculture in the shp deficit irrigation di has proved to be a promising approach for increasing the wp of various crops including wheat triticum aestivum l xu et al 2018 yu et al 2020 maize zea mays l attia et al 2021 di paolo and rinaldi 2008 cotton gossypium hirsutum l zhang et al 2016 common bean phaseolus vulgaris l soureshjani et al 2019 tomato solanum lycopersicum l kuşçu et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 soybean glycine max l sincik et al 2008 etc plant root modification is a crucial mechanism to counter drought stress farooq et al 2009 moisture stress under di may increase root growth enabling plants to mine water from deeper soil layers pace et al 1999 xu et al 2016 conversely severe moisture deficit increases soil mechanical resistance sharma et al 2014 resulting in a compacted layer that can impede root growth and elongation hodgkinson et al 2017 unger and kaspar 1994 plant root responses to water stress can differ among crop species with respect to crop management guan et al 2015 soil types bengough et al 2006 sharma et al 2017 and climatic conditions sharma et al 2014 depending on the deficit conditions and crop researchers have reported enhanced root growth under di sharma et al 2014 xu et al 2016 a decrease in root growth abrisqueta et al 2008 gheysari et al 2017 or no effect of di on root growth benjamin and nielsen 2006 parkash et al 2021b it should be noted that root adaptions among plants vary largely depending on the level of moisture stress ali et al 2019 rao et al 2016 sampathkumar et al 2012 to better understand the aboveground adaptions of a crop to different moisture stress levels it is essential to examine the belowground root adjustments the di is often accompanied by yield losses especially in water sensitive crops with shallow root systems such as sweet corn zea mays l var rugosa oktem 2008a singh et al 2019 however it is evident that plants can adapt to moderate water stress thereby increasing the wp with minimal yield losses parkash et al 2021a singh et al 2022 combining di with appropriate soil management practices may help to close the yield gaps relative to full irrigation biochar a carbon rich co product of pyrolysis of organic matter is known to improve soil properties although the biochar effect on soil varies intensely with soil texture feedstock and pyrolysis temperature its application generally increases soil porosity water retention and plant available water and decreases soil bulk density and tensile strength blanco canqui 2017 razzaghi et al 2020 previous reports have indicated the potential of biochar to alleviate negative effect of water stress on crop yields agbna et al 2017 langeroodi et al 2019 singh et al 2019 however crop root distribution and soil water depletion under integrated use of di strategies and biochar application are poorly understood we are hypothesizing that by improving soil structural properties and reducing soil compaction biochar may improve root growth and water extraction abilities of plants which can be important under water deficit conditions therefore the main objectives of this research were to i assess the effect of di and biochar application on the root distribution of sweet corn ii determine the water depletion patterns and wp of sweet corn in biochar amended soils under deficit irrigation 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description field experiments were conducted at quaker research farm texas tech

feedstock to slow pyrolysis at 350 c for 24 h the softwood biochar was prepared from pine at 500 c for 15 min both biochars were purchased from wakefield biochar detailed information on the chemical and physical characteristics of the two biochars is available in our previous report singh et al 2022 the biochars were manually spread in the experimental plots at the rate of 13 mg ha 1 and incorporated at approximately 15 cm depth using a tractor mounted rotary tiller on april 9 2019 26 days before planting 2 3 data collection 2 3 1 soil water content a capacitance probe pr2 6 profile

access tubes access tubes were installed between two plants in the center of each plot after crop emergence at 12 dap in 2019 and 17 dap in 2020 vwc was converted into soil water content mm at each

water content at the beginning of the stage the change in water storage in soil profile over the growing season was calculated by subtracting the soil water content at harvest from the initial soil water content 2 3 2 root sampling and analysis a stainless steel split core sampler was used to collect undisturbed soil core samples at the harvest maturity stage the samples were taken from the center of each plot at 3 5 cm distance from the base of plant perpendicular to the plant row two 30 cm split core sampler cup sets 5 cm diameter were connected with a coupler to give a 60 cm long split core sampler ams american falls id usa samples were collected down to 60 cm soil depth corresponding to the length of the sampler and diameter of 5 cm the split core sampler was pushed into the soil using a 14 kg heavy duty slide hammer and taken out with a hi lift jack an undisturbed 60 cm soil core sample was cut lengthwise at 10 cm incremental layers to analyze the root parameters separately at six soil depths each of these soil samples were stored in labeled ziploc polyethylene at 20 c before washing to separate roots for washing soil samples were placed on the first mesh strainer of the stack another finer mesh strainer was directly held beneath the first strainer to retain smaller root fragments passing through the top mesh water was sprinkled over the top strainer

irrigation biochar and combination of irrigation and biochar treatments were treated as fixed effects replications combination of replications with irrigation treatments and combination of replications with biochar treatments were treated as random effects root and soil water depletion data was first analyzed considering irrigation biochar and soil depth as fixed effects analyzes of variance were then performed with irrigation and biochar as fixed effects at each depth mean separation and pairwise comparisons were done using a sas macro pdmix800 saxton 1998 3 results and discussion this study investigated the integrated effect of di and biochar application on root growth soil water distribution and depletion yield and wp of sweet corn the results suggested that the interaction between irrigation and biochar for root parameters swd crop water use yield parameters and wp were mostly non significant the di had a significant effect on all the measured parameters and biochar affected the root parameters significantly therefore the results are discussed with emphasis on the main treatment effects 3 1 irrigation and weather conditions the weather conditions during the 2019 and 2020 growing seasons are presented in fig 1 the average maximum and minimum temperatures were warmer in 2020 than 2019 resulting in greater total reference evapotranspiration of 709 mm in 2020 compared to 634 mm in 2019 the total irrigation amounts and rainfall received during 2019 and 2020 growing seasons are given in table 1 the rainfall contributed 45 and 20 of total water applied to 100 etc treatment during 2019 and 2020 respectively in 2019 69 of rainfall occurred within 0 30 dap fig 1 the 100 etc received 160 mm higher supplemental irrigation in 2020 than in 2019 growing season the crop accumulated 1260 heat units in 2019 compared to 1524 in 2020 fig 1 in 2020 the 55 65 dap period was exceptionally hot and dry with average relative humidity reaching as low as 22 and maximum temperature as high as 43 c at 60 dap this period coincided with the reproductive stage of sweet corn adversely affecting kernel formation high temperatures during anthesis inhibit pollen viability and germination causing kernel abortion li and howell 2021 empty kernels in many ears reduced the yield substantially in 2020 compared to 2019 the yield results are given in more detail in section 3 5 3 2 soil water content differences in the vwc before the onset of di treatments were observed among the irrigation zones especially in 2019 where 40 etc plots recorded higher initial vwc within the 20 40 cm soil depths fig 2 these differences due to heterogenous distribution of water contents in different treatment plots are mostly unavoidable under field conditions fluctuations in vwc were greater within the 0 40 cm soil depths indicating the primary root water uptake layer hence soil water conditions within this layer 0 40 cm were more critical than the maximum root zone depth of 100 cm to help maintain the optimum rate of root water uptake under di irrigated sweet corn systems at 60 cm soil depth vwc remained more or less stable until about 45 dap during both years after that vwc dropped under 40 etc while increasing under 100 and 70 etc towards the end of the growing season this suggests that crops under 40 etc utilized the available soil water at 60 cm depth while soil water was stored in 100 and 70 etc treatments vwc at 100 cm depth remained relatively stable and similar among di treatments except for the initial differences vwc remained similar among di treatments until about 40 dap in the 0 40 cm soil depths after that vwc dropped in 70 and 40 etc compared to 100 etc during both years vwc was mostly highest in 100 etc followed by 70 and 40 etc except in the 20 40 cm soil depths in 2019 where 40 etc recorded greater vwc than 70 etc higher temperature and evaporative demands in 2020 caused greater fluctuations in vwc compared to 2019 growing season in 2020 at 60dap vwc dropped to 48 44 and 32 of the field capacity water content in 100 70 and 40 etc plots respectively within the upper 0 10 cm depths the biochar treatments did not impact vwc in the soil profile much during both years fig 2 biochar has been reported to improve the water retention capacity of soil by improving the soil physical properties razzaghi et al 2020 our results indicated a 3 decrease in bulk density and a 3 increase in porosity of sandy loam by 13 mg ha 1 hardwood biochar singh et al 2022 there were corresponding increase in saturated water content of soil without affecting the field capacity water content permanent wilting point and plant available water razzaghi et al 2020 reported that the biochar effects on soil physical properties and water retention are less pronounced in medium textured soils compared to coarse soils higher hardwood biochar rates may be required to alter the water retention of sandy loam soil in the region phillips et al 2020 also reported an increase in soil porosity water content at saturation with conifer wood and wheat straw biochar 9 36 t ha 1 but no effect on water content at field capacity 3 3 root distribution root distribution varies greatly with variation in moisture content in the soil profile chen et al 2018 gao et al 2014 simultaneously soil water availability to a crop greatly depends on root distribution bengough et al 2011 di had a significant p 0 05 effect on rld in 2019 but no effect was observed in 2020 table 2 in 2019 compared to 100 etc 70 etc increased rld by 20 while 40 etc decreased the rld by 23 analyzes of rld for different root diameter classes indicated that fine roots 0 0 5 mm accounted for 87 medium roots 0 5 2 mm 10 13 while coarse roots 2 mm were an insignificant proportion of total root length fig 3 the increase in rld under 70 etc in 2019 was mainly attributed to the increase in fine root length fig 3 as a result avd in 70 etc was reduced compared to 100 etc fig 4 however avd in 40 etc was statistically similar to 100 etc differences among treatments were observed for fine rld while medium rld remained comparable among treatments fig 3 crops adjust to mild water stress by allocating more resources to root growth jupp and newman 1987 sharp and davies 1979 while extreme water stress can decrease the root growth and penetration by causing mechanical impedance bengough et al 2006 2011 vandoorne et al 2012 the rld patterns observed among di treatments in our study are in agreement with kang et al 2000 who reported 20 increase in root biomass of maize at medium water deficit 50 65 of field capacity and 34 reduction in root biomass at severe water stress 40 55 of field capacity compared to well watered treatment 60 85 of field capacity sampathkumar et al 2012 also reported increased root growth under mild water deficit while lower root growth under severe water deficit in drip irrigated maize interactions among di treatments for rld across different soil depths were significant p 0 001 in 2019 table 2 analyzes of rld at different depths revealed an increase in rld for 70 etc at 0 30 cm soil depths while a decrease in rld for 40 etc at 0 40 cm compared to 100 etc fig 5 the rld at 40 60 cm depths did not differ significantly among the di treatments although the vmc below 40 cm soil depth was lower for 70 and 40 etc di treatments compared to 100 etc after mid season it remained well above field capacity fig 2 this suggests that water was not a limiting factor in deeper soil layers that might have resulted in similar root growth for di treatments rld distribution patterns across different soil depths under different irrigation treatments have yielded contrasting results in previous studies for various crops for instance contrary to our study xu et al 2018 reported a decline in rld in the upper soil layers 0 40 cm and an increase in rld in deeper layers 40 160 cm under limited irrigation compared to sufficient irrigation treatment in wheat flynn et al 2021 reported an increase in maturation root density of maize subjected to 40 and 65 of etc compared to 100 et in the entire 60 cm soil profile root growth results in 2020 were inconsistent with 2019 as no difference in rld was observed among irrigation treatments at all soil depths although 70 etc recorded the highest rld in 2020 it was not statistically different from 100 or 40 etc heat stress during the reproductive stage caused kernel abortion resulting in greater biomass allocation towards vegetative parts this effect was more obvious in 40 etc where heat stress was accompanied by severe water stress this may have resulted in greater root growth for 40 etc treatment in 2020 relative to 2019 these seasonal discrepancies in root distribution of crops due to varied weather conditions have been highlighted in some previous studies sharma et al 2017 zhang et al 2009 biochar effect on rld was non significant in 2019 but significant p 0 01 in 2020 table 2 hardwood biochar recorded the highest rld during both years followed by softwood and no biochar fig 3 hardwood biochar increased rld by 9 5 and 27 over no biochar treatment in 2019 and 2020 respectively organic amendments such as biochar can promote root growth by improving soil physiochemical properties bruun et al 2014 xiang et al 2017 xiao et al 2016 zhao et al 2018 bruun et al 2014 reported a 5 7 decrease in bulk density of sandy soil and a significant increase in root density of barley hordeum vulgare l with 2 hardwood biochar application in a laboratory column experiment we observed a 3 9 increase in soil porosity and a 4 decrease in bulk density with hardwood biochar application in the experimental field singh et al 2022 which may have influenced the root growth the softwood biochar had no effect on these soil physical properties and did not significantly affect the root growth the differences in rld among biochar treatments were significant only at 40 50 cm depth in 2020 where hardwood gave significantly higher rld than no biochar fig 5 in 2020 both hardwood and softwood biochar increased rld significantly over no biochar at 0 10 cm soil depth while at 10 20 cm depth hardwood amended soils gave higher rld compared to softwood and no biochar there were no differences in rld among biochar treatments at 20 60 cm depth this could largely be attributed to the fact that biochar was incorporated to a depth of about upper 15 cm in the soil rsad followed a similar pattern as rld for irrigation and biochar treatments during both years fig a 2 except rsad for 70 etc remained comparable to 100 etc at all soil depths during 2019 all measured root parameters varied significantly with soil depth table 2 the rld decreased towards deeper soil layers and was highest at 0 10 cm depth in 2019 and 10 20 cm depth in 2020 table a 1 of the total root length measured in the 0 60 cm soil profile 80 and 73 occurred within 0 30 cm depths in 2019 and 2020 respectively yu et al 2007 recorded 75 rld of maize within the 0 30 cm soil profile with the highest fraction at 0 10 cm soil depth the decline in rld towards deeper soil layers is well documented in many crops under unrestricted field conditions gao et al 2014 guan et al 2015 man et al 2016 yu et al 2007 under sub surface drip irrigation the root system is confined near the dripper reducing deeper root growth sampathkumar et al 2012 3 4 soil water depletion the irrigation and biochar interactions for swd were non significant in both years except for the early growth stage in 2020 table 1 irrigation treatments significantly affected the mid late and total swd during both years the swd at the early stage was comparable among irrigation treatments because all irrigation treatments received an approximately equal amount of water during this period the overall swd was highest in 40 etc followed by 70 and 100 etc treatments table 1 hao et al 2015 also reported greater soil water extraction at 50 etc compared to 100 and 75 etc by maize in a semi arid environment on the texas high plains although the 2020 growing season received greater supplemental irrigation the overall swd was greater in 2020 than in 2019 most likely due to environmental stress resulting from lower rainfall higher temperature and lower humidity greater swd occurred during the mid growth stage compared to early and late growth stages during both years table 1 these results were similar to the findings of pabuayon et al 2019 who reported maximum water extraction in cotton sesame sesamum indicum l and sorghum sorghum bicolor l during the mid season contrarily bhattarai et al 2020 reported greater swd during the early growth stage compared to the mid and late growth stages heavy rainfall during the early season in 2019 resulted in water storage in the soil profile apparently this stored water was utilized during the mid season during the late growth stage water storage occurred in the soil profile in both years even under 40 etc indicating that the crop did not utilize all of the supplied water it may be due to the lower water requirement of sweet corn towards maturity notably this suggests that the crop was over irrigated during this late growth stage especially in 100 etc treatment the rainfall events from 75 to 80 dap also contributed to water storage in 2020 the 100 and 70 etc recorded 34 7 mm and 22 mm water storage in the 2019 growing season and 7 7 mm and 0 3 mm water storage in 2020 within the 100 cm soil profile table 1 the 40 etc treatment recorded 0 23 mm and 41 8 mm water depletion in 2019 and 2020 respectively fig 6 compares the swd among irrigation treatments at different soil depths within 100 cm soil profile during early mid and late growth stages of sweet corn the swd was highest at 40 etc followed by 70 and 100 etc at almost all soil depths during both years with few exceptions the swd during the early growth stage did not differ significantly among irrigation treatments at almost all soil depths in both years during the mid growth stage the 40 etc increased the swd significantly over 100 etc within the 10 60 cm soil profile in 2019 and 20 60 cm in 2020 the 70 etc recorded significantly greater swd over 100 etc at 20 and 40 cm depths in 2019 and at 20 and 60 cm depth in 2020 during the mid growth stage during the late growth stage in 2019 the swd under 40 etc treatment was significantly higher than 100 etc at 10 and 60 cm depth whereas at 100 cm depth 70 etc recorded significantly greater swd than 40 and 100 etc treatments although we did not measure root growth at 100 cm depth increased swd for 70 etc at this depth might relate partly to greater root water uptake in 2020 the 40 increased the late stage swd over 100 etc at all soil depths the 40 etc recorded relatively greater swd from 40 100 cm soil profile compared to upper layers 0 40 cm during the late growth stage in both years the swd during the growing season was substantially higher in 40 etc than 100 etc at all soil depths in both years hence sweet corn roots under deficit irrigation practices might compensate for water stress in one part of the root zone by taking up water from less stressed parts of the root zone resulting in higher swd in the soil profile the 70 etc increased the total swd over 100 etc significantly at 30 cm and 60 cm depths in 2019 and 20 cm and 60 depths in 2020 in 2019 seasonal swd was greater in the upper soil profile 0 30 cm whereas in 2020 swd was greater in the 30 100 cm soil profile especially for 40 etc treatment this could be explained by greater rld in deeper soil layers 30 60 cm in 2020 27 of total rld values relative to 2019 20 of total also the overall greater swd in 2020 likely prevented the water percolation below the root zone datta et al 2022 recorded 75 water extraction from 0 to 30 cm soil depths in a 0 45 cm soil profile since 70 80 of sweet corn roots occurred in 0 30 cm soil depth a greater proportion of root water uptake was expected to occur within this region of the root zone however as mentioned earlier plants under water deficit conditions may respond to non uniform water stress in the root zone reduced water uptake in upper soil depths may be balanced by enhanced uptake from less water stressed deeper depths which results in increased root growth in deeper soil layers sharma et al 2017 xu et al 2016 our results did not show increased rld in deeper soil profile but the swd increased substantially from deeper soil layers in case of di treatments 70 and 40 etc relative to 100 etc along with root water uptake upward water movement due to capillary action and lesser water percolation to deeper layers during irrigation rainfall events could have resulted in greater swd for di treatments in deeper layers jha et al 2017 li et al 2010 biochar treatments did not significantly affect swd except at mid stage in 2019 when both hardwood and softwood biochar treatments recorded significantly greater swd than no biochar treatment table 1 analyzes of biochar effect on swd at different soil depths indicated a significant increase in swd for hardwood biochar treatment compared to no biochar at 60 cm soil depth during mid stage in 2019 fig a 3 the increased swd corresponded with greater rld for hardwood biochar compared to no biochar at 40 50 cm soil depth fig 5 however the total swd over the 2019 growing season did not differ significantly among biochar treatments at all depths within the 100 cm soil profile fig a 3 unlike our findings faloye et al 2019 reported a reduction in swd in maize caused by an improvement in soil hydro physical properties with the application of 20 t ha 1 maize cob residue biochar although hardwood biochar increased rld over no biochar at 0 20 cm depth in 2020 it did not affect swd at this depth generally evaporation of water from the soil surface in both bare during initial period of the growing season and under canopy during different growth stages soils can also account for a substantial proportion of soil water depletion in the topsoil layer i e 0 20 cm especially under semi arid environments liu et al 2002 estimated that evaporation took up 30 3 of the total evapotranspiration in maize majority of which occurs from upper soil layers the continuous measurement of soil water balance components especially evaporation and deep percolation was not made therefore measured variations of volumetric water contents alone could not provide information whether water was taken up by crops or lost from the root zone via evaporation or deep percolation apparently it was not well understood whether the increased rld contributed to an enhanced root water uptake increased rld in the upper soil profile might not increase the root water uptake zhang et al 2009 as reported in our previous publication singh et al 2022 biochar application had no effect on stomatal conductance transpiration and photosynthesis of sweet corn this indicates that the increased rld in the upper soil profile due to hardwood biochar application most likely did not increase root water uptake 3 5 crop water use yield and water productivity biochar application has been reported to alleviate the negative effect of water stress on crops and improve the wp alkhasha et al 2019 kangoma et al 2017 singh et al 2019 however our results showed that the interaction between irrigation and biochar treatments for etc act yield and wpyield biomass were non significant during both years table 3 however irrigation treatments had a significant influence on the above mentioned parameters biochar treatments did not affect these parameters significantly though hardwood biochar gave slightly higher yield and wpyield biomass than no biochar during both seasons faloye et al 2019 also observed non significant interaction between irrigation and biochar on maize yield and water use efficiency but 20 t ha 1 maize cob residue biochar application increased water use efficiency under all irrigation treatments our results partially agree with ramlow et al 2019 who reported an improvement in water retention with 25 t ha 1 pine biochar application without alleviating the negative effect of water stress on maize yield in this study hardwood biochar decreased the soil bulk density and increased soil porosity with a minimal effect on soil water retention therefore the effect on physical properties due biochar did not translate into plant yield and wp the hardwood and softwood biochar used in this study contain 63 and 88 carbon respectively one of the concerns about adding biochar to the agricultural soils is that high amount carbon incorporated with biochar may cause nitrogen immobilization by microbes some researchers have reported restricted plant growth and reduced yields with biochar application due n immobilization deenik et al 2010 liu et al 2017 however we did not observe any adverse effect on plant growth and yield during 2 years of study due biochar application interestingly hardwood increased the plant height and vegetative dry biomass sweet corn as reported in singh et al 2022 some of these positive effects of hardwood biochar especially during second year after application indicates that its effects on soil properties and plant growth need to be studies beyond 2 years while higher application rates may result in greater benefits they may not be a viable option for the farmers until locally produced biochar is available at cheaper prices compared to 100 etc 70 and 40 etc treatments reduced the etc act by 50 and 140 mm in 2019 and 82 and 155 mm in 2020 reduction in etc act did not have adverse effect on yield for 70 etc treatment the fresh ear yield was comparable between 100 and 70 etc treatments during both years the increase in stored soil moisture use under 40 etc fig 6 was not enough to maintain a high yield the 40 etc reduced the fresh ear yield by 17 in 2019 and 44 in 2020 compared to 100 etc our results were comparable to ertek and kara 2013 who observed a 4 reduction in sweet corn yield by applying 70 of full irrigation and a significant reduction of 24 in yield by applying 40 of full irrigation contrarily oktem 2008b reported a 39 yield reduction applying irrigation based on 70 class a pan evaporation compared to 100 these discrepancies in yield responses to di due to variations in genotypes weather conditions soil type irrigation systems irrigation timings etc are common and highlighted previously in literature cheng et al 2021 singh et al 2021a the fresh ear yield obtained in 2019 was 1 8 times that of 2020 in 2020 heat stress during silking stage adversely affected the kernel formation producing many ears with numerous empty kernels this caused greater biomass allocation to vegetative parts and reduced the harvest index substantially in 2020 compared to 2019 table 3 a similar adverse effect of heat stress on maize kernel formation and yield has been reported previously bakhtavar et al 2015 li and howell 2021 and particularly observed in other maize trials carried out in the area during 2020 season singh et al 2021b at 40 etc heat stress was combined with severe water stress resulting in greater negative impact on kernel formation the irrigation treatments had no effect on the harvest index in 2019 but it dropped drastically under 40 etc in 2020 table 3 the 70 etc increased the wpyield by 23 and 17 over 100 etc in 2019 and 2020 respectively the 40 etc increased the wpyield over 100 etc by 25 in 2019 but reduced by 18 in 2020 although the overall aboveground dry biomass production across treatments in 2020 was 27 higher than 2019 singh et al 2022 due to higher cumulative heat units and water use the overall wpbiomoss was only 7 higher in 2020 than 2019 both 70 and 40 etc treatments increased wpbiomoss significantly over 100 etc in 2019 while it remained comparable among irrigations in 2020 ertek and kara 2013 suggested that 70 etc can be a water saving strategy for sweet corn with minimal reduction in yield based on 4 year field trials in the us high plains trout and dejonge 2017 concluded that the water productivity of maize peaked at 75 etc and declined with further reduction in irrigation amount due to a rapid decline in yield hao et al 2015 also observed a 3 increase in water use efficiency at 75 etc and a drastic decline of 28 in water use efficiency at 50 etc irrigation for maize production in texas high plains 4 conclusion the 70 etc adjusted to water deficit by increasing root growth and stored soil water extraction from 100 cm soil profile averaged across two years 70 etc improved the wpyield by 21 over 100 etc without any significant reduction in yield the 40 etc increased the stored swd but it had a negative effect on root growth considering the yield losses and conflicting wpyield results at 40 etc during the two seasons 40 etc may not be a viable option for sweet corn production in a semi arid environment the soil water storage at the late growth stage during both years suggests that higher water restrictions can be investigated and adopted towards maturity biochar did not show any interactive effects with irrigation treatments within two years after application hardwood biochar increased the root growth in 0 20 cm soil profile without altering the swd yield and wp of sweet corn long term trials are suggested to test biochar effects under limited irrigation beyond two years the 70 etc can be recommended as an alternative water saving

the number of dams constructed upstream of the krishna and godavari rivers and the increased groundwater pumping has led to seawater intrusion and ecosystem disruption saxena et al 2004 climate change is expected to impose further adverse impacts on coastal groundwater resources including groundwater depletion and seawater intrusion verkooijen and ki moon 2021 polemic and walraevens 2019 due to heavy canalization and flood control measures the entire mississippi river delta is experiencing land subsidence and reduced sediment flows loucks 2019 while these exogenous biophysical drivers threaten deltas human responses to them are exacerbating the problem further the ganges brahmaputra meghna delta of bangladesh is seeing a shift in practices of rice cultivation to aquaculture and there is the additional pressure of building salinity in the delta essink 2017 to address these concerns and their effects on deltas understanding the complex interaction of groundwater gw and surface water sw and the way they are affected by groundwater over abstractions and agricultural activities including canalization for irrigation is crucial tian et al 2015 for better management quantifying and modeling the cause and effect of the various components coupled with the uncertainty and human responses requires attention and further research li et al 2017 groundwater models are useful in this sense and have previously been used to study and understand these effects for example in the mekong delta various scenarios of increasing abstraction and reduction in recharge were simulated which helped in the understanding of groundwater dynamics as well as the possibilities for sustainable water resources management nam 2017 groundwater sustainability is addressed globally using a modeling approach mulder 2018 casillas trasvina et al 2019 weerasekera 2017 gopinath et al 2016 jusseret et al 2009 nevertheless in much of the global south collecting the necessary information for model implementation is challenging and comes with a large degree of uncertainty for instance candela et al 2014 aghlmand and abbasi 2019 mende et al 2007 chinnasamy and agoramoorthy 2015 majumdar 2010 characterizing human responses and potential management pathways poses an additional challenge the objective of this research is to assess groundwater availability and the impacts of abstractions in the cauvery delta by building conceptual and numerical groundwater flow models the models were used to analyze historical changes in groundwater resources in response to increasing abstraction and decreasing upstream inflows the models were further used to formulate and assess two scenarios of groundwater development business as usual bau and a reduction in abstraction rate with the latter representing a future pathway towards a sustainable cauvery delta 2 data and methods 2 1 study area description the cauvery river basin is one of the largest river basins in southern india the river basin is around 81 155 km2 and is spread over the states of karnataka 42 23 kerala 3 53 puducherry 0 2 and tamil nadu 54 04 the river disembogues into the bay of bengal after traveling around 800 km part of its course forms the border with karnataka until it reaches the mettur dam constructed in 1934 nature 1934 which stores tamil nadu s water for use in the cauvery delta adb 2011b a long standing conflict between karnataka and tamil nadu existed regarding the proportion of the water shared between the two states it started in 1892 singh et al 2007 flared up after the withdrawal of the british government and subsequent re organization of states in 1956 schmidt et al 2018 and was eventually settled in 2007 after a tribunal verdict was delivered by the government of india that ordered karnataka to release water into tamil nadu every year singh et al 2007 however the amount of water that tamil nadu receives is lower than its 1970 share the 2000 year old grand anicut barrage is generally regarded as the beginning of the delta here the cauvery splits into several branches the northern branch is the coleroon river which is the north boundary of the delta in our model fig 1 the other three branches are the cauvery and vennar rivers and the grand anicut main canal the latter forming the western boundary the command areas of the branches consist of dense canal networks and are referred to as the old delta cauvery command area vennar delta vennar command area and new delta grand anicut command area respectively fig 1 the cauvery delta of tamil nadu has been affected by reduced freshwater inflow floods and increased salinity adb 2011c rainfall in the region has become more erratic and uncertain triggering a change in river flow regimes and a lower surface water availability this puts the delta at risk of salinization and creates the possibility of a reduction in crop productivity srinivasan 2019 the asian development bank summarizes the issues of the delta which highlights mentioning diminished surface water from the southwest monsoon and waterlogging caused by the more irregular and intense north east monsoon changing land use and cropping patterns due to 1 salinity in the region forcing farmers to shift from rice cultivation to aquaculture and 2 a decline in canal water forcing farmers to shift from two short duration rice varieties into a single extended one adb 2011a 2011b the various interlinked problems are presented in a conceptual model of the cauvery delta in fig 2 field interviews with farmers were conducted to obtain a better understanding of their issues regarding surface and groundwater availability quality as well as changing cropping patterns their general response was one of severe water shortage due to uncertain rains reduced inflows over extraction of groundwater and salinity issues this has led farmers to abandon shallow wells to drill deeper ones and to shift from paddy crops to saline tolerant crops such as cotton the scarcity situation has been causing distress among farmers their memories of destructive cyclones e g in 2018 and disastrous droughts e g in 2016 and 2017 were still fresh many shared the sentiment that their delta is drying beyond these accounts of farmers the drying delta narrative is found in the media and among policymakers yet it is found that hydrological evidence of impact on groundwater storage and salinity such as from developed groundwater models is currently lacking for the cauvery delta see also adb 2011c 2 2 data collection the data used in this study were collected from primary and secondary sources to characterize the hydrogeology of the cauvery delta 2 2 1 the digital elevation model dem the srtm dem was accessed using the usgs earth explorer the highest elevations were found towards the west the coastal zone is less than 5 masl with parts in the southeast being below sea level see fig 1 2 2 2 rainfall the gridded based rainfall data published by the indian meteorological department imd was used for the analysis of seasonal and annual trends from 1990 to 2019 the delta receives rains from the southwest monsoon sw from june to september while the northeast monsoon ne brings the highest rainfall to the delta from october to december the lowest rains are noticed during the dry season from february to may as shown in fig 3 there is a large inter annual variation in annual rainfall in this century the delta experienced prolonged dry spells in 2002 03 and 2016 17 after that there was a recovery in rainfall see fig 4 2 2 3 hydrogeology conducting a hydrogeological analysis of the aquifer and setting up the model was a challenge due to the absence of borehole data instead combined data from various sources and reports such as the india wris water resources information system the geological survey of india and a citizen science program of the atree team was used to enrich the data set it was observed that there is a mixture of permeable and impermeable geological settings across the delta especially for shallow depths most of the delta has alluvium deposition raju 2016 and the area is subjected to aquifer characterization of the cretaceous eocene pliocene miocene and quaternary alluvial aquifers ghosh 1999 table 1 shows the list of aquifer properties present in the delta along with the depth ranges 2 2 4 cropping the primary crop in the study area is rice however a range of other crops such as groundnuts banana maize cashew coconut and cotton are also cultivated depending on the water availability during growing seasons recently changes have been noticed in cropping patterns across the delta districts using landsat 7 and 8 images members of the atree project team made a comparison of land use classification see ganesh et al 2020 while following the command areas of the old delta vennar delta and new delta the maximum land use coverage in 2000 2001 shows a multi cropped paddy in the vennar delta area in recent years the cropping pattern has changed and shifted from multi crop to single paddy crop as shown in fig 5 2 2 5 groundwater levels data on groundwater depths are collected from government data sources such as the cgwb central groundwater board and the pwd public works department various government agencies are responsible for managing the data such as groundwater levels in the observation wells at various depths and locations the delta is divided into three districts see fig 1 and the monitored data was then requested from the state department to be shared for 30 years from 1990 to 2019 for dug and tube wells the data analysis is discussed in section 3 1 2 2 6 dam releases data data from outflows through the mettur dam were collected from the pwd tamil nadu for the period between 1974 and 75 and 2016 17 the data summarizes the monthly canal withdrawals from the mettur dam in the 43 years as furnished by the tamil nadu state department all the data collection for the various attributes listed with their sources are summarized in table 2 2 3 construction of the conceptual model model conceptualization was performed in the map module tool of groundwater modeling software gms tamil nadu wgs 84 epsg 7785 unit meters was used as the coordinate system in gms the model set up units in gms 10 4 8 and used meters for length and days for time the elevation from the dem was assigned to the top layer of the model which represents the surface elevation aquifer types and layers were identified from the literature and data on geological formations the top aquifer consists of quaternary alluvium formations that are unconfined the lower three aquifer layers are sandstone and laterite type and confined in nature cgwb 2020 adb 2011a fig 6 shows the cross section of the delta with the aquifer layers and the respective bottom elevations the groundwater head is indicated with colors for the first layer the east side of the cauvery delta is bounded by the coastline and thus assigned as a specified constant head boundary for all layers as shown in fig 7 the coleroon river and the grand anicut canal are considered general head boundaries in the top layer of the model for the second to the fourth layer it is assumed that there is no flow across the boundaries see fig 7 the stresses in the steady state and transient state models were assigned with the recharge and abstraction rates discharge components recharge rate was assigned as an area property which is the percentage of the rainfall in m d whereas abstraction rates were assigned to a tube well open well the abstraction rate was assigned as a negative value with the volumetric unit of m3 d recharge and discharge components were estimated from the annual water budget across the delta districts developed by cgwb the dense network of irrigation canals fig 1 is conceptualized as rivers and simulated with the river package in the modflow model 2 4 construction of the numerical model the objectives of modeling were to assess groundwater resources and the impacts of groundwater abstractions over a period of time by building both the steady state and transient groundwater flow models the steady state model was constructed using average recharge and discharge values based on the groundwater resources assessment water budget published by the central groundwater board cgwb 2019 for the year 2017 the transient simulation model is from 1990 to 2019 with a yearly stress period since most time dependent data are available yearly modflow code was used to construct the numerical model the uniform model grid was used with a cell size of 1000 m x 1000 m this resulted in 163 rows and 146 columns four model layers were chosen corresponding to four aquifer layers see fig 6 the top model layer is unconfined and the rest are confined semi permeable layers were not simulated explicitly in the model since there were no borehole data to classify aquifers and aquitards the vertical resistance due to the presence of aquitards is accounted for with small values of vertical hydraulic conductivity 2 4 1 model packages the layer property flow package lpf was chosen to compute horizontal and vertical groundwater flows the top elevation of the first model layer is the surface elevation derived from the dem data the elevations of the rest layers were specified as constant values as shown in fig 6 hydrogeological parameter zones were delineated with the hydrogeological map to define parameter values fig 8 the cauvery delta is divided into three major hydrogeological zones most area is covered by alluvium deposits which consist of sands and silts the yellow color of the hydrogeological map is of alluvium which is subdivided into four types based on the topographical features zones with the nomenclature in fig 8 are provided in table 3 the horizontal hydraulic conductivity values were estimated from lithologies and conductivities were calibrated during the model calibration the vertical hydraulic conductivity anisotropic factor was assumed as 1 20 to take account of the aquitards present in the aquifers the groundwater resources assessment report 1997 adopted the water level fluctuation method and rainfall infiltration method cgwb 1997 the recharge rate was determined by the terrain type recharge zones were developed based on hydrogeological settings as shown in fig 8 based on alluvial or hard rock settings the infiltration coefficient as the percentage of the annual precipitation was assigned as suggested by cbwb norms table 4 the percentages for various aquifer systems are within the recommended values as per the groundwater estimation committee kumar et al 2020 zones 9 and 10 are in the alluvium settings and thus the percentage recharge from rainfall is the highest the recharge is simulated with the recharge package rch the evapotranspiration was simulated with the et package the et zones were delineated with the land use map fig 5 as shown in fig 9 the extinction depths were specified according to major crops in the zones the dense network of irrigation canals and rivers was simulated with the river package riv the spatial distribution of canals and rivers was mapped from digitized data provided by the atree lab river canal width was estimated using qgis plugins and the head stage was estimated using the dem selection of each arc node used in the head stage in meters rivers and canals were defined as arcs with varying conductance canal conductance values were assigned based on their lined or unlined condition groundwater abstractions from dug tube wells in the delta were not metered and there was no record of the groundwater used for agriculture demands adb 2011a chinnasamy and agoramoorthy 2015 the gross yearly groundwater draft was calculated for irrigation domestic and industrial uses by the cgwb methodology cgwb 1997 there was no data available for the pumping well locations the number of pumping wells and the depth at which those are placed and groundwater is extracted there was no data for the abstraction rate of the pumping wells either groundwater abstraction rate was assigned to dug tube wells and simulated with the wells package for the transient model abstraction from layer one was assumed constant while abstractions in layers 2 and 3 which are critical for abstractions were considered with an increased rate over time from the census data it was found that there are 2000 villages towns present in the delta and 2000 drinking water wells are distributed in various zones and depths with calibrated abstraction rates 2 5 scenario formation this research considers the scenarios for estimating the future groundwater resources to indicate pathways to sustainability in terms of controlling water use canal water supply and groundwater abstraction of the cauvery delta two scenarios were formulated and simulated for the simulation period of 2020 2050 changes in groundwater heads and water budget were computed and compared for each scenario the original calibrated transient model was termed a benchmark model for comparison scenario 1 business as usual bau the business as usual scenario assumes that current irrigation practices and groundwater development will continue in the future groundwater recharge was estimated for a normal water year no extreme wet and dry years were considered the boundary conditions also remained the same scenario 2 reduction of abstraction all inputs were kept the same as in the first scenario while groundwater abstraction was reduced by 50 groundwater abstractions must be reduced by 50 by 2050 to mitigate groundwater depletion the reduction of the abstraction was applied in deep aquifers model layers 2 and 3 where large aquifer depletion was found 3 results 3 1 monitored groundwater levels the current study analyzed the time series of the monitored groundwater levels of dug and tube wells the measured groundwater levels in 94 dug wells and 75 tube wells are collected analyzed and used for model calibration as shown in fig 10 sampled wells are selected based on the maximum number of observations fig 11 plots the monthly groundwater level series from three dug wells groundwater levels from the dug wells located in the first aquifer layer show intra annual seasonal variations corresponding to wet and dry seasons and inter annual changes in response to dry and wet years the magnitude of seasonal variations ranges from 2 to 3 m groundwater levels in the dry season drop below sea level because of increased pumping in the wells there are no obvious trends found in shallow groundwater levels fig 12 represents the monitored groundwater level series from tube wells groundwater levels show a clear trend of decrease on top of seasonal fluctuations the lowest water levels occurred in the dry years of 2002 05 and 2016 2019 3 2 model calibration 3 2 1 calibrated steady state model fig 13 shows the scatter plots of the computed heads versus observed heads in general the computed heads resemble the observed heads in dug wells the mean residual error is 0 015 m the root mean squared error is 4 95 m and the correlation coefficient between the computed and observed heads is 0 96 in tube wells the mean residual error is 3 04 m the root means the squared error is 8 68 m and the correlation coefficient is 0 87 the accuracy of the model calibration is better for dug wells than for tube wells table 5 presents the water budget components recharge from precipitation dominates the inflow with 81 of the total inflow while leakage from irrigation canals accounts for 14 inflow from the sea accounts for 3 of the total inflow from the north and west boundaries is limited abstraction dominates groundwater discharge with 70 of the total outflow et accounts for 16 followed by discharge to rivers and canals a small amount of groundwater discharges to the sea and the north and west boundaries were observed the differences in the computed heads between the natural condition and under the abstraction provide estimates of drawdowns fig 14 plots the contour maps of drawdowns in the deep aquifers 2 and 3 cones of the depression are formed in the intensive abstraction areas for irrigation with a drawdown of about 25 m 3 2 2 historical changes in groundwater resources from the transient modeling fig 15 plots the computed heads and measured heads in two dug wells large differences can be found after 2010 computed groundwater levels showed a decreasing trend while the observed groundwater levels fluctuated in response to dry wet years this trend of decrease in groundwater levels is caused by increasing abstractions in deeper model layers since separate aquitards were not included in the model the model could not compute stable water levels in the first model layer the computed heads fit better with the observed heads in tube wells fig 16 both computed and observed heads show decreasing trends fig 17 plots inflow components recharge from precipitation varied largely depending on annual precipitation in the dry years of 1996 2003 recharges from precipitation are the lowest in recent years recharge from precipitation is modest seawater intrusion has increased in recent years and amounted to 1 37 108 m3 in 2019 fig 17 as far as the outflows discharge to boundaries rivers baseflows and the sea are concerned they show a similar trend over a period of time with a peak drop during the dry years 2002 2003 and 2016 2019 fig 18 groundwater abstraction is estimated to gradually increase from 8 22 108 m3 in 1990 1 73 109 m3 in 2008 and remain constant afterward fig 19 fig 19 shows that increasing well abstractions caused an increase in seawater intrusion the cumulative storage change fig 20 indicates continuous groundwater storage depletion amounting to 15 5 109 m3 by the end of 2019 fig 21 shows that cones of depression had developed where drops of groundwater levels reached 20 m in layer 2 and about 30 m in layer 3 3 3 scenario analysis scenario 1 shows that the continuation of current abstractions will greatly impact the groundwater budget and storage depletion table 6 indicates that seawater intrusion will increase by 39 by 2050 compared to the benchmark model calibrated transient model discharges to the river canal will be reduced significantly by 51 of the benchmark model inflow from boundaries will increase by almost 83 and outflows to the boundaries will be reduced by 53 large drops in groundwater levels can be seen in fig 22 which shows the contour maps of groundwater level decreases in layer 2 and layer 3 from 1990 to 2050 fig 23 shows the time series of the decrease of groundwater levels in layers 2 and 3 for zones of the vennar delta and grand anicut area the cones of depression extended to the whole aquifer the groundwater level decreases at about 30 m below the sea level at the center of the cones zone 3 fig 24 shows cumulative storage change under bau the accumulated storage depletion amounts to thirty billion cubic meters by 2050 in scenario 2 after minimizing the abstractions seawater intrusion was reduced by 51 table 6 discharges to canals rivers increased and recovered by almost 63 fig 24 shows a slow recovery of storage implying that the storage depletion is reversed under scenario 2 fig 25 shows the difference in the groundwater heads for scenario 2 between 2050 and 1990 the cones of depression are reduced in both layers fig 26 shows a slow recovery of groundwater levels in layer 2 and the rate of decrease of ground levels in layer 3 is reduced 4 discussion and concluding remarks the current situation of the cauvery delta is complicated and subject to complex and interconnected issues concerning water use availability and quality groundwater models were applied to analyze field observations as well as the feedback from farmers that the delta was drying as they experienced growing water scarcity and felt the necessity to drill deeper boreholes steady state and transient flow models were constructed under a data deficiency situation to research 1 the impact of groundwater abstraction on shallow and deep groundwater storage 2 the critically affected zones in the delta with historical changes in groundwater levels and 3 the current and future extent of seawater intrusion by mobilizing two scenarios of groundwater development some of the key findings of the paper contribute to the view that the cauvery delta is at a tipping point canal flows are reduced rains are more irregular and groundwater extractions are intensifying 4 1 data and model uncertainty due to the lack of essential data the model contains uncertainties in the conceptualization of the aquifer system layer properties and recharge and abstractions recharge estimation and estimation of groundwater abstraction have uncertainties cgwb 1997 2009 2017 cgwb estimated recharge using a percentage of annual precipitation which does not differentiate between extremely dry and wet years the groundwater abstraction data were collected from states as a total sum as no data was available about the number of wells their locations depth and rates there are uncertainties about groundwater level measurements as well groundwater levels were measured mostly from production wells a significant uncertainty was associated with long term groundwater level trends hora et al 2019 fishman et al 2011 the accuracy of the steady state model calibration is better for dug wells than for tube wells the accuracy of the transient model calibration is affected in the absence of information from separate aquitards abstractions et aquifer types and depths and canal river flows 4 2 model conclusions supporting field observations deeper aquifers show a decrease in groundwater levels with a cone of depression in the vennar and new deltas there are specific zones like the tail end of grand anicut canal zone 7 or the central part zone 3 that show a continuous decline in groundwater levels depletion of groundwater storage and induced seawater intrusion while the steady state model suggests that seawater intrusion is just 3 despite abstractions of around 70 of the total natural inflows the transient model indicates that seawater intrusion has increased three times from 1990 to 2019 this is deteriorating the groundwater quality indeed a water quality analysis cl and ec concentrations of cgwb state department data historical purchased data indicates inland salinity which was also found during field observations in zones 7 and 3 of the deltas where the groundwater was of the brackish saline type interestingly the model shows the trend ofdecreased groundwater level in the shallow aquifer over the last decades these results agree with farmers stories of a drying delta and the abandoning of shallow wells for deeper boreholes farmers drill deeper wells because of the insufficient reach to the surface water during the annual dry period while in the coastal area the use of shallow wells for irrigation is almost nil because of salinity overall the model results indicate that the deeper aquifers are heavily exploited every year especially during years when groundwater levels were dropping significantly we also conclude that the increased pumping coincides with the dry months of pre monsoon summer and also during the drought years the key finding of this study is that the aquifer has already reached its maximum groundwater development that is overexploited where an aquifer has reached an unsustainable situation of exceeding abstractions than the rate of replenishment in current times and there is no room for increasing the abstractions in the future on the contrary groundwater abstraction must be reduced to achieve long term sustainability 4 3 pathways for groundwater sustainability scenario 1 or the business as usual simulation shows that under the current abstraction regime groundwater levels will continuously decline which will result in large depletion of groundwater storage and induced seawater intrusion for developing pathways for groundwater sustainability in the cauvery delta key insights were gained from scenario 2 or the reduce abstraction by 50 simulation one of these insights refers to the targeting of the deeper aquifer layers for reduction while simulation improved recharge for the shallow aquifer for that path there is a need for robust chemical data and saline modeling to better assess seawater intrusion and current inland salinity and to understand the mechanism and distribution of saline water at shallow and deeper aquifers current research fulfills the requirement of developing an understanding of the realistic availability of groundwater resources in given space and time to address the delta water management issues two crucial transformations are needed for groundwater sustainability in the delta first to execute a far reaching and large scale groundwater recharge campaign to raise awareness and aid the recovery of water levels and water quality practices to this end can already be observed led by both government agencies and grassroots initiatives second to create a robust spatial and temporal groundwater monitoring system mobilizing both water quality and quantity data samples to assess the current groundwater regime and future trends considering the data limitations at various stages of the modeling there is scope for scaling and building data sets on hydrogeology aquitards and their properties groundwater abstractions and dense monitoring of water resources in the delta the current models can lead to building more robust future modeling by mobilizing citizen science campaign data of the delta such as the one we have recently set up despite uncertainties in the data and the model the constructed groundwater models provided useful insights for the control of groundwater abstractions and seawater intrusion that will hopefully be taken up by policymakers and other water professionals to come to the aid of the

9058,many of the world s deltas are highly productive areas for agriculture as well as important places of socio economic development but are currently under stress this study assesses the impacts of stresses on groundwater pumping changing cropping patterns and saltwater intrusion on groundwater resources in the cauvery delta in tamil nadu india a transient groundwater flow model of the delta was constructed for this assessment the historical changes in groundwater resources in response to decreasing irrigation canal flows and increasing groundwater abstractions were assessed for the past 30 years furthermore the model was used to formulate and analyze future sustainable groundwater development scenarios farmers narratives about a drying delta as they experience water scarcity and quality issues most closely were ascertained in the research farmers have abandoned many shallow wells in their fields the model simulation shows groundwater levels are decreasing and aquifer storage depleting furthermore salinization has increased with continuous declining groundwater levels in the deep aquifer from 1990 to 2019 a more robust hydro chemical assessment and further modeling of seawater intrusion are needed to better assess the sources and distribution of groundwater salinity the pathway for future sustainability requires enhancing groundwater recharge in the shallow aquifer

sense and have previously been used to study and understand these effects for example in the mekong delta various scenarios of increasing abstraction and reduction in recharge were simulated which

approach mulder 2018 casillas trasvina et al 2019 weerasekera 2017 gopinath et al 2016 jusseret et al 2009 nevertheless in much of the global south collecting the necessary information for model implementation is challenging and comes with a large degree of uncertainty for instance candela et al 2014 aghlmand and abbasi 2019 mende et al 2007 chinnasamy and agoramoorthy 2015 majumdar 2010 characterizing human responses and potential management pathways poses an additional challenge the objective of this research is to assess groundwater availability and the impacts of abstractions in the cauvery delta by building conceptual and numerical groundwater flow models the models were used to analyze historical changes in groundwater resources in response to increasing abstraction and decreasing upstream inflows the models were further used to formulate and assess two scenarios of groundwater development business as usual bau and a reduction in abstraction rate with the latter representing a future pathway towards a sustainable cauvery delta 2 data and methods 2 1 study area description the cauvery river basin is one of the largest river basins in southern india the river basin is around 81 155 km2 and is spread over the states of karnataka 42 23 kerala 3 53 puducherry 0 2 and tamil nadu 54 04 the river disembogues into the bay of bengal after traveling around 800 km part of its course forms the border with karnataka until it reaches the mettur dam constructed in 1934 nature 1934 which stores tamil nadu s water for use in the cauvery delta adb 2011b a long standing conflict between karnataka and tamil nadu existed regarding the proportion of the water shared between the two states it started in 1892 singh et al 2007 flared up after the withdrawal of the british government and subsequent re organization of states in 1956 schmidt et al 2018 and was eventually settled in 2007 after a tribunal verdict was delivered by the government of india that ordered karnataka to release water into tamil nadu every year singh et al 2007 however the amount of water that tamil nadu receives is lower than its 1970 share the 2000 year old grand anicut barrage is generally regarded as the beginning of the delta here the cauvery splits into several branches the northern branch is the coleroon river which is the north boundary of the delta in our model fig 1 the other three branches are the cauvery and vennar rivers and the grand anicut main canal the latter forming the western boundary the command areas of the branches consist of dense canal networks and are referred to as the old delta cauvery command area vennar delta vennar command area and new delta grand anicut command area respectively fig 1 the cauvery delta of tamil nadu has been affected by reduced freshwater inflow floods and increased salinity adb 2011c rainfall in the region has become more erratic and uncertain triggering a change in river flow regimes and a lower surface water availability this puts the delta at risk of salinization and creates the possibility of a reduction in crop productivity srinivasan 2019 the asian development bank summarizes the issues of the delta which highlights mentioning diminished surface water from the southwest monsoon and waterlogging caused by the more irregular and intense north east monsoon changing land use and cropping patterns due to 1 salinity in the region forcing farmers to shift from rice cultivation to aquaculture and 2 a decline in canal water forcing farmers to shift from two short duration rice varieties into a single extended one adb 2011a 2011b the various interlinked problems are presented in a conceptual model of the cauvery delta in fig 2 field interviews with farmers were conducted to obtain a better understanding of their issues regarding surface and groundwater availability quality as well as changing cropping patterns their general response was one of severe water shortage due to uncertain rains reduced inflows over extraction of groundwater and salinity issues this has led farmers to abandon shallow wells to drill deeper ones and to shift from paddy crops to saline tolerant crops such as cotton the scarcity situation has been causing distress among farmers their memories of destructive cyclones e g in 2018 and disastrous droughts e g in 2016 and 2017 were still fresh many shared the sentiment that their delta is drying beyond these accounts of farmers the drying delta narrative is found in the media and among policymakers yet it is found that hydrological evidence of impact on groundwater storage and salinity such as from developed groundwater models is currently lacking for the cauvery delta see also adb 2011c 2 2 data collection the data used in this study were collected from primary and secondary sources to characterize the hydrogeology of the cauvery delta 2 2 1 the digital elevation model dem the srtm dem was accessed using the usgs earth explorer the highest elevations were found towards the west the coastal zone is less than 5 masl with parts in the southeast being below sea level see fig 1 2 2 2 rainfall the gridded based rainfall data published by the indian meteorological department imd was used for the analysis of seasonal and annual trends from 1990 to 2019 the delta receives rains from the southwest monsoon sw from june to september while the northeast monsoon ne brings the highest rainfall to the delta from october to december the lowest rains are noticed during the dry season from february to may as shown in fig 3 there is a large inter annual variation in annual rainfall in this century the delta experienced prolonged dry spells in 2002 03 and 2016 17 after that there was a recovery in rainfall see fig 4 2 2 3 hydrogeology conducting a hydrogeological analysis of the aquifer and setting up the model was a challenge due to the absence of borehole data instead combined data from various sources and reports such as the india wris water resources information system the geological survey of india and a citizen science program of the atree team was used to enrich the data set it was observed that there is a mixture of permeable and impermeable geological settings across the delta especially for shallow depths most of the delta has alluvium deposition raju 2016 and the area is subjected to aquifer characterization of the cretaceous eocene pliocene miocene and quaternary alluvial aquifers ghosh 1999 table 1 shows the list of aquifer properties present in the delta along with the depth ranges 2 2 4 cropping the primary crop in the study area is rice however a range of other crops such as groundnuts banana maize cashew coconut and cotton are also cultivated depending on the water availability during growing seasons recently changes have been noticed in cropping patterns across the delta districts using landsat 7 and 8 images members of the atree project team made a comparison of land use classification see ganesh et al 2020 while following the command areas of the old delta vennar delta and new delta the maximum land use coverage in 2000 2001 shows a multi cropped paddy in the vennar delta area in recent years the cropping pattern has changed and shifted from multi crop to single paddy crop as shown in fig 5 2 2 5 groundwater levels data on groundwater depths are collected from government data sources such as the cgwb central groundwater board and the pwd public works department various government agencies are responsible for managing the data such as groundwater levels in the observation wells at various depths and locations the delta is divided into three districts see fig 1 and the monitored data was then requested from the state department to be shared for 30 years from 1990 to 2019 for dug and tube wells the data analysis is discussed in section 3 1 2 2 6 dam releases data data from outflows through the mettur dam were collected from the pwd tamil nadu for the period between 1974 and 75 and 2016 17 the data summarizes the monthly canal withdrawals from the mettur dam in the 43 years as furnished by the tamil nadu state department all the data collection for the various attributes listed with their sources are summarized in table 2 2 3 construction of the conceptual model model conceptualization was performed in the map module tool of groundwater modeling software gms tamil nadu wgs 84 epsg 7785 unit meters was used as the coordinate system in gms the model set up units in gms 10 4 8 and used meters for length and days for time the elevation from the dem was assigned to the top layer of the model which represents the surface elevation aquifer types and layers were identified from the literature and data on geological formations the top aquifer consists of quaternary alluvium formations that are unconfined the lower three aquifer layers are sandstone and laterite type and confined in nature cgwb 2020 adb 2011a fig 6 shows the cross section of the delta with the aquifer layers and the respective bottom elevations the groundwater head is indicated with colors for the first layer the east side of the cauvery delta is bounded by the coastline and thus assigned as a specified constant head boundary for all layers as shown in fig 7 the coleroon river and the grand anicut canal are considered general head boundaries in the top layer of the model for the second to the fourth layer it is assumed that there is no flow across the boundaries see fig 7 the stresses in the steady state and transient state models were assigned with the recharge and abstraction rates discharge components recharge rate was assigned as an area property which is the percentage of the rainfall in m d whereas abstraction rates were assigned to a tube well open well the abstraction rate was assigned as a negative value with the volumetric unit of m3 d recharge and discharge components were estimated from the annual water budget across the delta districts developed by cgwb the dense network of irrigation canals fig 1 is conceptualized as rivers and simulated with the river package in the modflow model 2 4 construction of the numerical model the objectives of modeling were to assess groundwater resources and the impacts of groundwater abstractions over a period of time by building both the steady state and transient groundwater flow models the steady state model was constructed using average recharge and discharge values based on the groundwater resources assessment water budget published by the central groundwater board cgwb 2019 for the year 2017 the transient simulation model is from 1990 to 2019 with a yearly stress period since most time dependent data are available yearly modflow code was used to construct the numerical model the uniform model grid was used with a cell size of 1000 m x 1000 m this resulted in 163 rows and 146 columns four model layers were chosen corresponding to four aquifer layers see fig 6 the top model layer is unconfined and the rest are confined semi permeable layers were not simulated explicitly in the model since there were no borehole data to classify aquifers and aquitards the vertical resistance due to the presence of aquitards is accounted for with small values of vertical hydraulic conductivity 2 4 1 model packages the layer property flow package lpf was chosen to compute horizontal and vertical groundwater flows the top elevation of the first model layer is the surface elevation derived from the dem data the elevations of the rest layers were specified as constant values as shown in fig 6 hydrogeological parameter zones were delineated with the hydrogeological map to define parameter values fig 8 the cauvery delta is divided into three major hydrogeological zones most area is covered by alluvium deposits which consist of sands and silts the yellow color of the hydrogeological map is of alluvium which is subdivided into four types based on the topographical features zones with the nomenclature in fig 8 are provided in table 3 the horizontal hydraulic conductivity values were estimated from lithologies and conductivities were calibrated during the model calibration the vertical hydraulic conductivity anisotropic factor was assumed as 1 20 to take account of the aquitards present in the aquifers the groundwater resources assessment report 1997 adopted the water level fluctuation method and rainfall infiltration method cgwb 1997 the recharge rate was determined by the terrain type recharge zones were developed based on hydrogeological settings as shown in fig 8 based on alluvial or hard rock settings the infiltration coefficient as the percentage of the annual precipitation was assigned as suggested by cbwb norms table 4 the percentages for various aquifer systems are within the recommended values as per the groundwater estimation committee kumar et al 2020 zones 9 and 10 are in the alluvium settings and thus the percentage recharge from rainfall is the highest the recharge is simulated with the recharge package rch the evapotranspiration was simulated with the et package the et zones were delineated with the land use map fig 5 as shown in fig 9 the extinction depths were specified according to major crops in the zones the dense network of irrigation canals and rivers was simulated with the river package riv the spatial distribution of canals and rivers was mapped from digitized data provided by the atree lab river canal width was estimated using qgis plugins and the head stage was estimated using the dem selection of each arc node used in the head stage in meters rivers and canals were defined as arcs with varying conductance canal conductance values were assigned based on their lined or unlined condition groundwater abstractions from dug tube wells in the delta were not metered and there was no record of the groundwater used for agriculture demands adb 2011a chinnasamy and agoramoorthy 2015 the gross yearly groundwater draft was calculated for irrigation domestic and industrial uses by the cgwb methodology cgwb 1997 there was no data available for the pumping well locations the number of pumping wells and the depth at which those are placed and groundwater is extracted there was no data for the abstraction rate of the pumping wells either groundwater abstraction rate was assigned to dug tube wells and simulated with the wells package for the transient model abstraction from layer one was assumed constant while abstractions in layers 2 and 3 which are critical for abstractions were considered with an increased rate over time from the census data it was found that there are 2000 villages towns present in the delta and 2000 drinking water wells are distributed in various zones and depths with calibrated abstraction rates 2 5 scenario formation this research considers the scenarios for estimating the future groundwater resources to indicate pathways to sustainability in terms of controlling water use canal water supply and groundwater abstraction of the cauvery delta two scenarios were formulated and simulated for the simulation period of 2020 2050 changes in groundwater heads and water budget were computed and compared for each scenario the original calibrated transient model was termed a benchmark model for comparison scenario 1 business as usual bau the business as usual scenario assumes that current irrigation practices and groundwater development will continue in the future groundwater recharge was estimated for a normal water year no extreme wet and dry years were considered the boundary conditions also remained the same scenario 2 reduction of abstraction all inputs were kept the same as in the first scenario while groundwater abstraction was reduced by 50 groundwater abstractions must be reduced by 50 by 2050 to mitigate groundwater depletion the reduction of the abstraction was applied in deep aquifers model layers 2 and 3 where large aquifer depletion was found 3 results 3 1 monitored groundwater levels the current study analyzed the time series of the monitored groundwater levels of dug and tube wells the measured groundwater levels in 94 dug wells and 75 tube wells are collected analyzed and used for model calibration as shown in fig 10 sampled wells are selected based on the maximum number of observations fig 11 plots the monthly groundwater level series from three dug wells groundwater levels from the dug wells located in the first aquifer layer show intra annual seasonal variations corresponding to wet and dry seasons and inter annual changes in response to dry and wet years the magnitude of seasonal variations ranges from 2 to 3 m groundwater levels in the dry season drop below sea level because of increased pumping in the wells there are no obvious trends found in shallow groundwater levels fig 12 represents the monitored groundwater level series from tube wells groundwater levels show a clear trend of decrease on top of seasonal fluctuations the lowest water levels occurred in the dry years of 2002 05 and 2016 2019 3 2 model calibration 3 2 1 calibrated steady state model fig 13 shows the scatter plots of the computed heads versus observed heads in general the computed heads resemble the observed heads in dug wells the mean residual error is 0 015 m the root mean squared error is 4 95 m and the correlation coefficient between the computed and observed heads is 0 96 in tube wells the mean residual error is 3 04 m the root means the squared error is 8 68 m and the correlation coefficient is 0 87 the accuracy of the model calibration is better for dug wells than for tube wells table 5 presents the water budget components recharge from precipitation dominates the inflow with 81 of the total inflow while leakage from irrigation canals accounts for 14 inflow from the sea accounts for 3 of the total inflow from the north and west boundaries is limited abstraction dominates groundwater discharge with 70 of the total outflow et accounts for 16 followed by discharge to rivers and canals a small amount of groundwater discharges to the sea and the north and west boundaries were observed the differences in the computed heads between the natural condition and under the abstraction provide estimates of drawdowns fig 14 plots the contour maps of drawdowns in the deep aquifers 2 and 3 cones of the depression are formed in the intensive abstraction areas for irrigation with a drawdown of about 25 m 3 2 2 historical changes in groundwater resources from the transient modeling fig 15 plots the computed heads and measured heads in two dug wells large differences can be found after 2010 computed groundwater levels showed a decreasing trend while the observed groundwater levels fluctuated in response to dry wet years this trend of decrease in groundwater levels is caused by increasing abstractions in deeper model layers since separate aquitards were not included in the model the model could not compute stable water levels in the first model layer the computed heads fit better with the observed heads in tube wells fig 16 both computed and observed heads show decreasing trends fig 17 plots inflow components recharge from precipitation varied largely depending on annual precipitation in the dry years of 1996 2003 recharges from precipitation are the lowest in recent years recharge from precipitation is modest seawater intrusion has increased in recent years and amounted to 1 37 108 m3 in 2019 fig 17 as far as the outflows discharge to boundaries rivers baseflows and the sea are concerned they show a similar trend over a period of time with a peak drop during the dry years 2002 2003 and 2016 2019 fig 18 groundwater abstraction is estimated to gradually increase from 8 22 108 m3 in 1990 1 73 109 m3 in 2008 and remain constant afterward fig 19 fig 19 shows that increasing well abstractions caused an increase in seawater intrusion the cumulative storage change fig 20 indicates continuous groundwater storage depletion amounting to 15 5 109 m3 by the end of 2019 fig 21 shows that cones of depression had developed where drops of groundwater levels reached 20 m in layer 2 and about 30 m in layer 3 3 3 scenario analysis scenario 1 shows that the continuation of current abstractions will greatly impact the groundwater budget and storage depletion table 6 indicates that seawater intrusion will increase by 39 by 2050 compared to the benchmark model calibrated transient model discharges to the river canal will be reduced significantly by 51 of the benchmark model inflow from boundaries will increase by almost 83 and outflows to the boundaries will be reduced by 53 large drops in groundwater levels can be seen in fig 22 which shows the contour maps of groundwater level decreases in layer 2 and layer 3 from 1990 to 2050 fig 23 shows the time series of the decrease of groundwater levels in layers 2 and 3 for zones of the vennar delta and grand anicut area the cones of depression extended to the whole aquifer the groundwater level decreases at about 30 m below the sea level at the center of the cones zone 3 fig 24 shows cumulative storage change under bau the accumulated storage depletion amounts to thirty billion cubic meters by 2050 in scenario 2 after minimizing the abstractions seawater intrusion was reduced by 51 table 6 discharges to canals rivers increased and recovered by almost 63 fig 24 shows a slow recovery of storage implying that the storage depletion is reversed under scenario 2 fig 25 shows the difference in the groundwater heads for scenario 2 between 2050 and 1990 the cones of depression are reduced in both layers fig 26 shows a slow recovery of groundwater levels in layer 2 and the rate of decrease of ground levels in layer 3 is reduced 4 discussion and concluding remarks the current situation of the cauvery delta is complicated and subject to complex and interconnected issues concerning water use availability and quality groundwater models were applied to analyze field observations as well as the feedback from farmers that the delta was drying as they experienced growing water scarcity and felt the necessity to drill deeper boreholes steady state and transient flow models were constructed under a data deficiency situation to research 1 the impact of groundwater abstraction on shallow and deep groundwater storage 2 the critically affected zones in the delta with historical changes in groundwater levels and 3 the current and future extent of seawater intrusion by mobilizing two scenarios of groundwater development some of the key findings of the paper contribute to the view that the cauvery delta is at a tipping point canal flows are reduced rains are more irregular and groundwater extractions are intensifying 4 1 data and model uncertainty due to the lack of essential data the model contains uncertainties in the conceptualization of the aquifer system layer properties and recharge and abstractions recharge estimation and estimation of groundwater abstraction have uncertainties cgwb 1997 2009 2017 cgwb estimated recharge using a percentage of annual precipitation which does not differentiate between extremely dry and wet years the groundwater abstraction data were collected from states as a total sum as no data was available about the number of wells their locations depth and rates there are uncertainties about groundwater level measurements as well groundwater levels were measured mostly from production wells a significant uncertainty was associated with long term groundwater level trends hora et al 2019 fishman et al 2011 the accuracy of the steady state model calibration is better for dug wells than for tube wells the accuracy of the transient model calibration is affected in the absence of information from separate aquitards abstractions et aquifer types and depths and canal river flows 4 2 model conclusions supporting field observations deeper aquifers show a decrease in groundwater levels with a cone of depression in the vennar and new deltas there are specific zones like the tail end of grand anicut canal zone 7 or the central part zone 3 that show a continuous decline in groundwater levels depletion of groundwater storage and induced seawater intrusion while the steady state model suggests that seawater intrusion is just 3 despite abstractions of around 70 of the total natural inflows the transient model indicates that seawater intrusion has increased three times from 1990 to 2019 this is deteriorating the groundwater quality indeed a water quality analysis cl and ec concentrations of cgwb state department data historical purchased data indicates inland salinity which was also found during field observations in zones 7 and 3 of the deltas where the groundwater was of the brackish saline type interestingly the model shows the trend ofdecreased groundwater level in the shallow aquifer over the last decades these results agree with farmers stories of a drying delta and the abandoning of shallow wells for deeper boreholes farmers drill deeper wells because of the insufficient reach to the surface water during the annual dry period while in the coastal area the use of shallow wells for irrigation is almost nil because of salinity overall the model results indicate that the deeper aquifers are heavily exploited every year especially during years when groundwater levels were dropping significantly we also conclude that the increased pumping coincides with the dry months of pre monsoon summer and also during the drought years the key finding of this study is that the aquifer has already reached its maximum groundwater development that is overexploited where an aquifer has reached an unsustainable situation of exceeding abstractions than the rate of replenishment in current times and there is no room for increasing the abstractions in the future on the contrary groundwater abstraction must be reduced to achieve long term sustainability 4 3 pathways for groundwater sustainability scenario 1 or the business as usual simulation shows that under the current abstraction regime groundwater levels will continuously decline which will result in large depletion of groundwater storage and induced seawater intrusion for developing pathways for groundwater sustainability in the cauvery delta key insights were gained from scenario 2 or the reduce abstraction by 50 simulation one of these insights refers to the targeting of the deeper aquifer layers for reduction while simulation improved recharge for the shallow aquifer for that path there is a need for robust chemical data and saline modeling to better assess seawater intrusion and current inland salinity and to understand the mechanism and distribution of saline water at shallow and deeper aquifers current research fulfills the requirement of developing an understanding of the realistic availability of groundwater resources in given space and time to address the delta water management issues two crucial transformations are needed for groundwater sustainability in the delta first to execute a far reaching and large scale groundwater recharge campaign to raise awareness and aid the recovery of water levels and water quality practices to this end can already be observed led by both government agencies and grassroots initiatives second to create a robust spatial and temporal groundwater monitoring system mobilizing both water quality and quantity data samples to assess the current groundwater regime and future trends considering the data limitations at various stages of the modeling there is scope for scaling and building data sets on hydrogeology aquitards and their properties groundwater abstractions and dense monitoring of water resources in the delta the current models can lead to building more robust future modeling by mobilizing citizen science campaign data of the delta such as the one we have recently set up despite uncertainties in the data and the model the constructed groundwater models provided useful insights for the control of groundwater abstractions and seawater intrusion that will hopefully be taken up by policymakers and other water professionals to come to the aid of the

9059,to investigate the pollution status and probable health risk of potential toxic elements ptes in soil and vegetables in historical wastewater irrigation region eight types of vegetables n 73 and corresponding soils were collected to determine the contents of pb cd cu zn ni and cr and their potential health risk to local vegetable consumers the results showed that the mean contents of pb cd cu zn ni and cr in these soils were 39 72 1 06 38 47 255 00 27 45 and 61 83 mg kg respectively with cd exceeding the national standard of china 0 6 mg kg gb 15618 2018 nemerow integrated pollution indices revealed that more than 50 of these soils were slightly or moderately polluted the activity ratios of pb cd cu and zn ranged from 0 18 to 0 26 which was much higher than that of ni and cr the average ptes in vegetables were all within the limitation of china or fao who except for pb however the ptes accumulation capacity in different vegetables varied greatly with the bioaccumulation factor of cilantro 0 023 0 232 0 031 0 063 0 009 and 0 007 for pb cd cu zn ni and cr and white radish 0 004 0 058 0 008 0 021 0 003 and 0 002 for pb cd cu zn ni and cr being the highest and lowest respectively health risk assessment revealed that local residents suffered both non carcinogenic and carcinogenic risk with the hazard index hi ranging from 0 73 to 2 45 and 2 02 6 53 and the target carcinogenic risk tcr ranging from 2 22 10 3 to 5 92 10 3 and 6 67 10 3 to 1 70 10 2 for adults and children respectively pb and cd contributed more than 62 37 of the hi and cd contributed more than 79 42 of the tcr these results indicate that historical wastewater irrigation has a long term impact on local food safety and potentially adverse consequences for human health graphical abstract ga1 keywords health risk assessment heavy metal rural urban fringe zone transformation vegetable data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the rapid population growth industrialization and urbanisation of the past few decades consumed large amounts of fresh water especially surface water and shallow groundwater which results in the scarcity of fresh water for agricultural needs in semi arid regions of the world baggio et al 2021 guadie et al 2021 dovlatabadi et al 2022 therefore treated or untreated wastewater has been used for irrigation to alleviate the shortage of fresh water resources especially in developing countries such as egypt pakistan china india iran and bangladesh moghaddam et al 2022 sardar et al 2020 liang et al 2021 osman et al 2021 previous studies indicated that more than 99 of the sewage water was used directly for crop cultivation in pakistan sardar et al 2020 and about 2 4 billion m3 year of raw wastewater was applied into farmland in egypt osman et al 2021 therefore more attention should be paid to the impact of wastewater irrigation on soil environment and human health wastewater irrigation can bring multiple benefits for agricultural production such as low cost uninterrupted supplies reduction the effluent disposal cost supply of nutrients nitrogen phosphorus potassium and trace elements and an increase of crop yield minhas et al 2015 naz et al 2020 however it also leads to the accumulation of potential toxic elements ptes in agricultural soil i e cd pb cu zn ni and cr wang et al 2017 oubane et al 2021 which are toxic persistent non biodegradable and can be biomagnified through the food chain wang et al 2021 ma et al 2022 su et al 2022 furthermore most of these ptes contaminated farmland is still being cultivated due to the large population and limited land resources marufi et al 2022 ghaderpoori et al 2020 many studies regarding the transformation and potential risk of ptes in soil food systems in wastewater irrigation region have been reported ma et al 2021 saleh et al 2019 nawaz et al 2021 khaskhoussy et al 2022 however the attention paid to the ptes in soil vegetable system in historical wastewater irrigation region is still limited vegetables are a great source of many essential nutrients including carbohydrates vitamin protein thiamine dietary fiber and trace elements that are needed for a healthy life vats et al 2022 and have been considered as protective food for human haroon et al 2021 recently people are becoming increasingly aware of the nutritional value of vegetables and their ability to improve overall health hence the use of vegetables in daily intake has increased ni et al 2021 unfortunately vegetables have shown a greater capacity to accumulate ptes rahmdel et al 2018 and contributed more than 70 of the total ptes intake by human yuan et al 2019 liu et al 2021 therefore regularly monitoring of ptes in vegetables is critical for preventing their accumulation in the food chain and lowering the potential health risk to local vegetable consumers the study region was situated in central china s kaifeng city a well known tourist destination the wastewater irrigation region which was previously far from the city has now become the rural urban fringe with the expansion of kaifeng city previous studies showed that growing fresh vegetables in the rural urban transition zone is a widespread practice in many countries aboubakar et al 2021 bayissa and gebeyehu 2021 similarly some of the farmers in this region replaced their traditional crops by vegetable cultivation to increases the household income furthermore because vegetables can be planted in small scale farmland with short growth cycles and are mostly sold by local markets or street peddlers it is difficulty to supervise their ptes content by local government therefore investigating the accumulation of ptes in vegetables in this region can provide important information for decision makers to adjust the plantation structure understanding the accumulation of ptes in vegetables is a crucial factor for both agricultural sustainability and public health the main aims of present study were 1 to evaluate the ptes contamination status in vegetable soil in the rural urban fringe zone as influenced by historical wastewater irrigation 2 to evaluate the bioaccumulation of ptes in edible part of different vegetables 3 to assess the potential health risk of ptes to local vegetable consumers 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and samples collection the study region was located in kaifeng city henan province central china 34 46 0 55 34 49 33 26 n 114 23 34 51 114 25 53 76 e which was influenced by typical temperate continental monsoon climate fig 1 the average annual temperature and precipitation are 14 52 c and 627 5 mm respectively the soil was developed from the alluvium flooded yellow river hundred years ago and classified as fluvisol he et al 2023 in 1970 s this region was industrial a chemical fertilizer plant was built in 1958 and relocated in 2020 and a lead zine smelter was built in 1989 and closed in 1998 and agricultural ecotone and relatively far from the kaifeng city the wastewater from these two enterprises was all discharged directly into the huafei river and the ammonia in the wastewater which was very expensive in china at that time prompted local farmers to use it for irrigation which lasted for more than 9 years resulting in ptes accumulation in soil with the expansion of kaifeng city the wastewater irrigated region becomes the rural urban fringe zone these enterprises were closed or relocated and wastewater irrigation has also been forbidden by local government twenty two years ago however ptes in soil still exist and affect the quality of agricultural products with the pursuit of more incomes for farmers part of the traditional crops wheat and corn was replaced by fruits and vegetables cultivation these products including grains vegetables and fruits still can be sold in local market pose a potential health risk to local consumers at present the transformation of ptes in soil wheat and soil grape system and related potential health risk has been reported in our previous studies ding et al 2023 yang et al 2022a however the transformation of ptes in soil vegetable system has not been reported seventy three pairs of soil and vegetable samples edible part were randomly collected from the study region in 2020 including chinese cabbage cc brassica pekinensis l n 11 spinach sp spanacia oleracea l n 9 yellow cabbage yc brassica pekinensis l n 9 white radish wr raphanus sativus l n 7 greengrocery gr brassica campestris l n 16 lettuce le lactuca sativa l n 3 cilantro ci coriandrum sativum l n 5 and rape seedling rs brassica napus l n 13 the photos of these vegetables are shown in fig s1 for each soil sample five subsamples were collected with the separation distance of the five subsamples 0 25 cm depth being 3 5 m after thoroughly mixed approximately 1 kg of these soil samples were transported to the laboratory corresponding to the soil samples the edible part of vegetable samples approximately 0 5 kg were also collected by five subsamples and stored in a cooler box before transported to the laboratory 2 2 sample preparation and analysis the soil samples were air dried grounded manually and sieved through 18 mesh 1 mm for ph detection and 100 mesh 150 µm for ptes and organic matter om content detection nylon sieve the ph of these soil samples was determied by a ph meter phsj 3 f with the soil to water ratio of 1 2 5 w v the om content was determined by wet oxidation according to our previous report wang et al 2020 the total contents of ptes in soil pb cd cu zn ni and cr were detected by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms thermo fisher x2 usa after the digestion with mixed hno3 hf and hclo4 the bioavailability of ptes was extracted by dtpa cacl2 tea solution gb t 23739 2009 and determined by icp ms thermo fisher x2 usa the vegetable samples were washed with tap water to remove the adsorbed soil and particulate matters and then washed twice with deionized water the cleaned vegetables were dried to a constant weight in a drying oven at 70 c the weight loss of these vegetables was recorded the dried vegetables were crushed by a stainless steel mill and digested with mixed strong acids hno3 and hclo4 the content of ptes in the digested solution was measured by icp ms thermo fisher x2 usa the detailed digestion procedures for both soil and vegetable were provided in the supplementary materials the chemical analysis of these samples both soil and vegetable was conducted in triplicate with regent blank and the gbw07413 for soil and gbw10011 for vegetable were used as the standard reference materials for quality assurance and quality control the recoveries of these considered ptes were all within the acceptable range 90 110 the practical limit for analysis of pb cd cu zn ni and cr were 0 036 0 0018 0 029 0 532 0 037 and 0 027 ug l respectively 2 3 assessment of ptes pollution the single factor pollution index p i and nemerow integrated pollution index p n were used to evaluate the pollution level of ptes in these soils according to the description of our previous report yang et al 2022a the p i and p n of each soil sample were calculated according to the follow equations 1 p i c i c 0 i 2 p n p i max 2 p i a v e 2 2 where c i is the individual pte concentration in soil mg kg c 0i is the standard limit of that pte in soil the risk screening values for metals in agricultural soil in china were used in the present study gb 15618 2018 ph 7 5 p imax and p iave are the maximum and average value of p i of these considered metals the division and class of p i and p n were defined according to the description of previous report table 1 zang et al 2017 2 4 bioaccumulation factor the bioaccumulation factor baf was used to determine the accumulation capacity of ptes from soil to the edible part of different vegetables wang et al 2019 the baf index was defined as 3 b f c vegetable c soil where c vegetable is the metal content in edible part of vegetables mg kg fresh weight c soil is the total content of corresponding metal in corresponding soil sample mg kg 2 5 health risk assessment the target hazard quotient hq and hazard index hi were used to assess the non carcinogenic risk of the considered ptes to local vegetable consumers liu et al 2020 the hq and hi index were calculated as follows 4 a d i c i i r e f e d a t b w 5 h q a d i r f d 6 h i i 1 n h q i where adi is the average daily intake of the considered ptes through vegetable ingestion mg kg day c i is the concentration of ptes in edible part of vegetables mg kg fresh weight ir is the estimated daily intake of the vegetables 0 244 and 0 186 kg day were selected for children and adults respectively liu et al 2021 ef is the exposure frequency of local vegetable consumers to ptes 365 days year ed is the exposure duration 70 years for adults and 12 years children kukusamude et al 2021 at is the average time of ptes exposure for non carcinogens calculated by 365 ed d bw is the body weight of the local vegetable consumers kg 15 0 and 63 5 kg for children and adults respectively rfd is the reference dose of considered ptes mg kg day the values for pb cd cu zn ni and cr are 0 0035 0 001 0 04 0 300 0 02 and 0 003 liu et al 2021 hq is the non carcinogenic risk of each considered pte hi is the total non carcinogenic risk of these considered ptes generally the value of hq or hi lower than 1 is presumed has no non carcinogenic risk target carcinogenic risk tcr was used to evaluate the risk of cancer disease to local vegetable consumers due to exposure to ptes liu et al 2021 the tcr value of each carcinogenic element can be added together if there existence multiple carcinogenic elements the tcr value was calculated by following equation 7 t c r e d i s f where sf represent the cancer slope factor of the carcinogenic elements according to previous report cd pb ni and cr were considered as carcinogenic elements and the sfs value were selected as 6 1 0 0085 0 84 and 0 5 mg kg day respectively antoniadis et al 2019 the tcr value lower than 10 6 means that the carcinogenic risk is negligible tcr value between 10 6 and 10 4 means the risk is in an acceptable range tcr value higher than 10 4 means the vegetables consumers have the risk of developing cancer diseases 2 6 statistical analysis all experiment data were statistically analyzed by microsoft excel 2010 and spss 25 0 the non carcinogenic risk of ptes in vegetables was expressed as the means standard deviations the significant test were conducted by one way anova and multiple comparison spss 25 0 tukey p 0 05 the drawing of all charts was conducted by origin 8 5 3 results and discussion 3 1 selected soil properties and contents of ptes in vegetable soil the selected soil properties and contents of ptes in vegetable soil are shown in table 2 the ph of these vegetable soils ranged from 6 86 to 8 61 with a mean ph value of 7 81 indicating that the soil in the study region was slightly alkaline the om content in these vegetable soils ranged from 0 34 to 4 66 with a mean content of 2 52 in our previous study the mean ph and om content of the vineyard soil in the same region are 7 95 and 2 39 respectively which are highly consistent with our present study yang et al 2022a in addition the coefficient of variation cvs of soil ph and om content were 4 92 low variability and 36 14 moderate variability respectively xiao et al 2015 this result implied that different planting structure and agronomic measures just slightly influenced soil ph but seriously influenced the om content in soil duan et al 2020 the contents of ptes in these vegetable soils ranged from 0 14 to 2 16 mg kg for cd 17 40 36 32 mg kg for pb 25 68 74 74 mg kg for cu 58 78 655 22 mg kg for zn 18 99 59 46 mg kg for ni and 48 02 249 62 mg kg for cr with the mean contents of 1 06 39 72 38 47 255 00 27 45 and 61 83 mg kg respectively table 2 the mean contents of these ptes all exceeded their background values except for cr but were lower than the risk screening values defined by the national standard of china gb 15618 2018 except for cd this result indicates that these vegetable soils were mainly polluted by cd in addition the cvs of cd pb cu zn ni and cr in these vegetable soils were 58 90 98 25 23 17 61 21 17 51 and 37 17 respectively with cd pb and zn having the high variability xiao et al 2015 this result implies that cd pb and zn in these vegetable soils differed greatly and had been seriously influenced by human activities another interesting finding is that the mean contents of these ptes except for ni in vegetable soils was lower than that of the vineyard soil in the same region especially for cd yang et al 2022a the mean content of cd 1 06 mg kg was only one third of that in vineyard soil 3 08 mg kg this result can be attributed to the different cultivated crops vegetables have a higher yield and stronger accumulation capacity for ptes compared with grape milicevic et al 2018 you et al 2020 guadie et al 2021 and can also be harvested several times a year long term vegetables cultivation can remove ptes from the soil similar to phytoremediation and reduce their total content significantly 3 2 assessment of ptes pollution in vegetable soil the pollution status of these vegetable soils is shown in table 3 the p i of cu ni and cr in all vegetable soils were lower than 1 and classified in the unpolluted range one soil sample was moderately polluted with pb and other soil samples were unpolluted 2 and 22 out of 73 soil samples were moderately and slightly polluted with zn respectively cd was the main pollutant in these vegetable soils approximately 16 44 27 40 and 19 18 of these vegetable soils were highly moderately and slightly polluted with cd respectively in addition the average p i of these ptes decreased as follows cd 1 77 zn 0 85 cu 0 38 cr 0 25 pb 0 23 ni 0 14 these results further verified that these vegetable soils were mainly polluted by cd many previous studies have revealed that cd could be accumulated easily in edible part of crops ran et al 2016 liu et al 2021 ugulu et al 2021 and the pollution of cd in these vegetable soils may pose health risk to local residents the p n value of these vegetable soils varied from 0 26 to 2 68 with a mean value of 1 33 the numbers of soil samples classified as moderate pollution slightly pollution precaution and safe were 20 20 9 and 24 respectively table 3 fortunately no soil sample was heavily polluted this result indicates that more than 50 of these vegetable fields were slightly or moderate polluted by ptes furthermore vegetables especially for leafy vegetable can accumulate ptes easily chen et al 2021 lu et al 2021 and the content of ptes in vegetables may exceed the national standard of china gb 2762 2017 even the soil just slightly polluted therefore it is essential to monitor the ptes content of vegetables regularly which can prevent excessive intake of ptes through the food chain and reduce their threat to the health of local residents 3 3 bioavailable ptes in vegetable soils the bioavailable ptes in soil ranged from 0 03 to 0 79 mg kg for cd 1 56 28 81 mg kg for pb 1 62 35 22 mg kg for cu 3 80 168 91 for zn 0 12 1 23 mg kg for ni 0 00 0 12 mg kg for cr table 4 with a mean content of 0 29 8 16 7 87 45 51 0 51 and 0 02 mg kg respectively similar to the total ptes contents in vegetable soils the bioavailable ptes in vegetable soil was much lower than those in vineyard soil in the study region yang et al 2022a which further verified that different crop cultivation can significantly influence the accumulation and fractions of ptes in soil zhao et al 2012 although the long term planting of vegetables reduced the total content of ptes in soil the mean activity ratios of ptes bioavailable content total content were 26 07 21 88 19 81 18 08 1 87 and 0 03 for cd pb cu zn ni and cr respectively fig s2 still similar to those of the vineyard soil except for ni and cr this finding suggestions that ptes fractions in soil are dynamic and can be transferred from one fraction to another as the environment changes pueyo et al 2008 hulisz et al 2022 more importantly the activity ratio of cr is 0 03 which was much lower than other metals and can be attributed to the high stability of cr iii in soil environment ju et al 2022 3 4 ptes content in different vegetables the contents of ptes fresh weight in different vegetables are shown in fig 2 the mean ptes contents in cc sp yc wr gr le ci and rs were 0 16 0 10 0 09 0 07 0 10 0 13 0 18 and 0 13 mg kg for cd 0 26 0 34 0 41 0 14 0 31 0 36 0 77 and 0 43 mg kg for pb 0 13 0 15 0 05 0 11 0 14 0 12 0 41 and 0 16 mg kg for cr respectively fig 2a b f apparently the mean contents of cd and cr in all vegetables were within the permissible limits of china 0 1 mg kg in wr and 0 2 mg kg in other vegetables for cd 0 5 mg kg for cr gb 2762 2017 but the mean pb contents in these vegetables exceeded the permissible limits of china 0 3 mg kg gb 2762 2017 except for cc and wr surprisingly cd is the main pollutant in these vegetable soils table 3 and has been considered to be easily accumulated by vegetables guadie et al 2021 ugulu et al 2021 however its mean contents in these vegetables were all within the permissible limits of china contrarily just 1 out of 73 vegetable soils was moderately polluted with pb but the pb contents in 41 out of 73 vegetable samples were higher than the permissible limits of china 0 3 mg kg these results may indicate that multiple factors can influence the accumulation of ptes in vegetables which is well consistent with previous reports gan et al 2017 golia et al 2021 however the mechanisms by which different factors influence ptes accumulation in vegetables require further investigation the contents of cu zn and ni in these vegetables ranged from 0 04 to 0 34 mg kg 1 95 18 61 mg kg and 0 04 0 34 mg kg respectively and the mean contents of these metals in different vegetables varied greatly in fact these metals are essential trace metals for living beings and important in oxygen transport enzyme synthesis and detoxification hu et al 2013 naz et al 2020 however the need for these metals in living beings is very low and excessive intake of these metals will endanger human health mani et al 2021 the contents of these metals in vegetables are not limited in the national standard of china gb 2762 2017 but the fao who set the permissible limits for cu and ni in vegetables as 40 and 10 mg kg respectively alsafran et al 2021 apparently cu and ni contents in these vegetables are much lower than this limit indicating that these vegetables are not polluted by cu and ni furthermore the contents of these ptes in different vegetables varied greatly especially for ci the mean contents of cd pb cu zn ni and cr in ci were 0 18 0 77 1 22 10 99 0 24 and 0 41 mg kg fresh weight respectively which are all the highest among these vegetables and significantly higher than most other vegetables fig s3 p 0 05 this result indicates that the species is a critical factor affecting the accumulation of ptes in vegetables of course the total content of ptes in soil and other soil properties also influenced the content of ptes in vegetables correlation analysis indicated that the total contents of cd p 0 01 pb p 0 05 and zn p 0 05 and bioavailable cd p 0 01 pb p 0 05 cu p 0 01 and zn p 0 01 in soil were significantly positively correlated with their contents in vegetables table s1 in addition cd content in vegetables was also significantly correlated with soil ph these results further verified that the ptes contents in vegetables can be influenced by multiple factors includes vegetable species total and bioavailable ptes content in soil and soil properties gan et al 2017 zwolak et al 2019 3 5 bioaccumulation of ptes in different vegetables the bioaccumulation factors bf of ptes in different vegetables are shown in fig 3 the average bf of ptes in ci was the highest among these vegetables and significantly higher than most of other vegetables p 0 05 but it was still much lower than the report of khan et al 2020 in fact because ci is usually used as a side dish little attention has been paid to its accumulation of ptes rahmdel et al 2018 however the high bf value suggests that long term excessively consumption of ci grown in ptes contaminated region may endanger human health besides that the average bf of different ptes in wr was the lowest and had certain differences with other vegetables but most of these differences were nonsignificant p 0 05 for ptes the average bfs of cd pb cu zn ni and cr in these vegetables were 0 103 0 010 0 016 0 032 0 022 and 0 008 respectively with the bf of cd being significantly higher than other metals fig s4 this result indicates that cd can be accumulated more easily in vegetables compared with other metals which is consistent with many previous reports chen et al 2021 liu et al 2021 dovlatabadi et al 2022 in addition the toxicity of cd is relatively higher than that of other metals yang et al 2022a the high accumulation capacity of cd in these vegetables may pose potential health risk to local vegetable consumers 3 6 health risk assessment the results of non carcinogenic risk via the consumption of these vegetables are shown in table 5 for adults the hqs of individual metals of all vegetables were lower than 1 but the hi of these vegetables were ranging from 0 73 in wr to 2 45 in ci with only the hi of wr lower than 1 for children the hqs of these metals are much higher than that of the adults most of the hqs for pb and cd in vegetables were higher than 1 except for the pb in cc and wr cd in wr and the minimum hi of these vegetables for children was 2 02 which was still much higher than the permission limit hi 1 these results indicate that the local vegetables consumers face a serious risk of noncancerous diseases especially for children in addition the his of both adults and children are mainly contributed by pb and cd with their contributions ranging from 62 37 to 76 13 for adults and 72 20 83 82 for children respectively which are similar with many previous reports zhao et al 2012 li et al 2018 ugulu et al 2021 in fact the mean cd content in these vegetables was all within the national limit standard of china fig 2a but the hq of cd was the most important contributor for hi and even exceeded the safety limit for children except for cc and wr this result indicates that some contradiction may exist between the national limit standard of china and the health risk assessment model and more effort should be made to revise the standard or the assessment model furthermore the health risk caused by different vegetables varied greatly the maximum and minimum mean hi values for both adults and children were found in ci 2 45 and 6 53 for adults and children respectively and wr 0 73 and 2 02 for adults and children respectively this finding suggests that dietary habit may have unanticipated effects on human health the tcr through the consumption of these vegetables is shown in fig 4 the mean tcr values of these vegetables for adults decreased in the following order ci 5 9 10 3 cc 4 3 10 3 rs 3 7 10 3 le 4 3 10 3 sp 3 5 10 3 gr 2 9 10 3 yc 2 6 10 3 wr 2 2 10 3 which all exceeded the acceptable range 1 0 10 4 kukusamude et al 2021 the change order of the tcr values for children is same as that for adult but is much higher more than one order of magnitude fig 4 furthermore the contribution of cd to tcr was 70 83 88 31 for adult and 79 42 91 91 for children respectively followed by cr ni and pb the contents of pb in most of these vegetables exceeded the national standard of china but its tcr contribution for both adult and children was almost negligible lower than 0 5 which further verified the contradiction between the national standard of china and the health risk assessment model based on the results above local residents suffered health risk both non carcinogenic and carcinogenic risk in varying degrees via the consumption of vegetables however this is just one of the pathways for local residents to be exposed to ptes local residents can also be exposed to ptes via consumption of meat wheat rice milk and water khan et al 2013 omar et al 2015 yang et al 2022b furthermore ptes in soil or dust can also enter into human body via ingestion dermal contact and inhalation song et al 2018 tian et al 2020 as a result the integrated health risk posed by ptes to local residents must be greater than our present study and a more comprehensive assessment should be conducted in the future 4 limitations and future research potential toxic elements contamination in soil caused by wastewater irrigation is widespread throughout the world particularly in developing countries the contamination status of ptes in soil and different vegetables in the historical wastewater irrigation region was reported in this study as was the potential health risk to vegetable consumers the findings revealed that the soil in the wastewater irrigation region was still heavily contaminated with ptes even after the wastewater irrigation had been stopped for more than twenty years the accumulation capacity of different vegetables for ptes varied and almost all ptes in these vegetables were within the limitation of china or fao who but they all pose serious risk to local vegetable consumers especially for children however there are still some limitations to this study 1 the closedown of the lead zinc smelter and forbidden of the wastewater irrigation were in 1998 and it is impossible to get the basic characteristics of the wastewater used for irrigation 2 the soil and vegetable samples were collected from different plots and belonged to different families their different fertilization regimes and cultivate patterns may have some influence on soil properties and accumulation of ptes in vegetables but this influence was neglected in addition the historical wastewater irrigation region needs to be further studied from two angles firstly to investigate the change trend of ptes in soil irrigation water and various crops wheat corn vegetables and fruits in the study region and assess the comprehensive health risk of ptes to local residents through multiple exposure pathways secondly to explore the countermeasures for these ptes contaminated soil in historical wastewater irrigation region 5 conclusions in conclusion historical wastewater irrigation resulted in the vegetable soils in the rural urban fringe zone being contaminated with ptes especially for cd the average p i of cd was much higher than other metals and more than 50 of these soil samples were slightly or moderately polluted by ptes the activity ratio of these ptes decreased as follows cd pb cu zn ni cr although the bf of cd in these vegetables is much higher than that of other metals just the mean content of pb in these vegetables exceeded the national limit standard of china risk assessment revealed that local vegetable consumers suffered serious potential health risk with ci being the highest in addition pb and cd was the major contributors to hi cd was the major contributor to tcr the results of present study suggested that more attention should be paid to ptes in vegetables planted in rural urban fringe zone and effective measures should be implemented by local government to reduce the potential health

9059,to investigate the pollution status and probable health risk of potential toxic elements ptes in soil and vegetables in historical wastewater irrigation region eight types of vegetables n 73 and corresponding soils were collected to determine the contents of pb cd cu zn ni and cr and their potential health risk to local vegetable consumers the results showed that the mean contents of pb cd cu zn ni and cr in these soils were 39 72 1 06 38 47 255 00 27 45 and 61 83 mg kg respectively with cd exceeding the national standard of china 0 6 mg kg gb 15618 2018 nemerow integrated pollution indices revealed that more than 50 of these soils were slightly or moderately polluted the activity ratios of pb cd cu and zn ranged from 0 18 to 0 26 which was much higher than that of ni and cr the average ptes in vegetables were all within the limitation of china or fao who except for pb however the ptes accumulation capacity in different vegetables varied greatly with the bioaccumulation factor of cilantro 0 023 0 232 0 031 0 063 0 009 and 0 007 for pb cd cu zn ni and cr and white radish 0 004 0 058 0 008 0 021 0 003 and 0 002 for pb cd cu zn ni and cr being the highest and lowest respectively health risk assessment revealed that local residents suffered both non carcinogenic and carcinogenic risk with the hazard index hi ranging from 0 73 to 2 45 and 2 02 6 53 and the target carcinogenic risk tcr ranging from 2 22 10 3 to 5 92 10 3 and 6 67 10 3 to 1 70 10 2 for adults and children respectively pb and cd contributed more than 62 37 of the hi and cd contributed more than 79 42 of the tcr these results indicate that historical wastewater irrigation has a long term impact on local food safety and potentially adverse consequences for human health graphical abstract ga1 keywords health risk assessment heavy metal rural urban fringe zone transformation vegetable data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the rapid population growth industrialization and urbanisation of the past few decades consumed large amounts of fresh water especially surface water and shallow groundwater which results in the scarcity of fresh water for agricultural needs in semi arid regions of the world baggio et al 2021 guadie et al 2021 dovlatabadi et al 2022 therefore treated or untreated wastewater has been used for irrigation to alleviate the shortage of fresh water resources especially in developing countries such as egypt pakistan china india iran and bangladesh moghaddam et al 2022 sardar et al 2020 liang et al 2021 osman et al 2021 previous studies indicated that more than 99 of the sewage water was used directly for crop cultivation in pakistan sardar et al 2020 and about 2 4 billion m3 year of raw wastewater was applied into farmland in egypt osman et al 2021 therefore more attention should be paid to the impact of wastewater irrigation on soil environment and human health wastewater irrigation can bring multiple benefits for agricultural production such as low cost uninterrupted supplies reduction the effluent disposal cost supply of nutrients nitrogen phosphorus potassium and trace elements and an increase of crop yield minhas et al 2015 naz et al 2020 however it also leads to the accumulation of potential toxic elements ptes in agricultural soil i e cd pb cu zn ni and cr wang et al 2017 oubane et al 2021 which are toxic persistent non biodegradable and can be biomagnified through the food chain wang et al 2021 ma et al 2022 su et al 2022 furthermore most of these ptes contaminated farmland is still being cultivated due to the large population and limited land resources marufi et al 2022 ghaderpoori et al 2020 many studies regarding the transformation and potential risk of ptes in soil food systems in wastewater irrigation region have been reported ma et al 2021 saleh et al 2019 nawaz et al 2021 khaskhoussy et al 2022 however the attention paid to the ptes in soil vegetable system in historical wastewater irrigation region is still limited vegetables are a great source of many essential nutrients including carbohydrates vitamin protein thiamine dietary fiber and trace elements that are needed for a healthy life vats et al 2022 and have been considered as protective food for human haroon et al 2021 recently people are becoming increasingly aware of the nutritional value of vegetables and their ability to improve overall health hence the use of vegetables in daily intake has increased ni et al 2021 unfortunately vegetables have shown a greater capacity to accumulate ptes rahmdel et al 2018 and contributed more than 70 of the total ptes intake by human yuan et al 2019 liu et al 2021 therefore regularly monitoring of ptes in vegetables is critical for preventing their accumulation in the food chain and lowering the potential health risk to local vegetable consumers the study region was situated in central china s kaifeng city a well known tourist destination the wastewater irrigation region which was previously far from the city has now become the rural urban fringe with the expansion of kaifeng city previous studies showed that growing fresh vegetables in the rural urban transition zone is a widespread practice in many countries aboubakar et al 2021 bayissa and gebeyehu 2021 similarly some of the farmers in this region replaced their traditional crops by vegetable cultivation to increases the household income furthermore because vegetables can be planted in small scale farmland with short growth cycles and are mostly sold by local markets or street peddlers it is difficulty to supervise their ptes content by local government therefore investigating the accumulation of ptes in vegetables in this region can provide important information for decision makers to adjust the plantation structure understanding the accumulation of ptes in vegetables is a crucial factor for both agricultural sustainability and public health the main aims of present study were 1 to evaluate the ptes contamination status in vegetable soil in the rural urban fringe zone as influenced by historical wastewater irrigation 2 to evaluate the bioaccumulation of ptes in edible part of different vegetables 3 to assess the potential health risk of ptes to local vegetable consumers 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and samples collection the study region was located in kaifeng city henan province central china 34 46 0 55 34 49 33 26 n 114 23 34 51 114 25 53 76 e which was influenced by typical temperate continental monsoon climate fig 1 the average annual temperature and precipitation are 14 52 c and 627 5 mm respectively the soil was developed from the alluvium flooded yellow river hundred years ago and classified as fluvisol he et al 2023 in 1970 s this region was industrial a chemical fertilizer plant was built in 1958 and relocated in 2020 and a lead zine smelter was built in 1989 and closed in 1998 and agricultural ecotone and relatively far from the kaifeng city the wastewater from these two enterprises was all discharged directly into the huafei river and the ammonia in the wastewater which was very expensive in china at that time prompted local farmers to use it for irrigation which lasted for more than 9 years resulting in ptes accumulation in soil with the expansion of kaifeng city the wastewater irrigated region becomes the rural urban fringe zone these enterprises were closed or relocated and wastewater irrigation has also been forbidden by local government twenty two years ago however ptes in soil still exist and affect the quality of agricultural products with the pursuit of more incomes for farmers part of the traditional crops wheat and corn was replaced by fruits and vegetables cultivation these products including grains vegetables and fruits still can be sold in local market pose a potential health risk to local consumers at present the transformation of ptes in soil wheat and soil grape system and related potential health risk has been reported in our previous studies ding et al 2023 yang et al 2022a however the transformation of ptes in soil vegetable system has not been reported seventy three pairs of soil and vegetable samples edible part were randomly collected from the study region in 2020 including chinese cabbage cc brassica pekinensis l n 11 spinach sp spanacia oleracea l n 9 yellow cabbage yc brassica pekinensis l n 9 white radish wr raphanus sativus l n 7 greengrocery gr brassica campestris l n 16 lettuce le lactuca sativa l n 3 cilantro ci coriandrum sativum l n 5 and rape seedling rs brassica napus l n 13 the photos of these vegetables are shown in fig s1 for each soil sample five subsamples were collected with the separation distance of the five subsamples 0 25 cm depth being 3 5 m after thoroughly mixed approximately 1 kg of these soil samples were transported to the laboratory corresponding to the soil samples the edible part of vegetable samples approximately 0 5 kg were also collected by five subsamples and stored in a cooler box before transported to the laboratory 2 2 sample preparation and analysis the soil samples were air dried grounded manually and sieved through 18 mesh 1 mm for ph detection and 100 mesh 150 µm for ptes and organic matter om content detection nylon sieve the ph of these soil samples was determied by a ph meter phsj 3 f with the soil to water ratio of 1 2 5 w v the om content was determined by wet oxidation according to our previous report wang et al 2020 the total contents of ptes in soil pb cd cu zn ni and cr were detected by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms thermo fisher x2 usa after the digestion with mixed hno3 hf and hclo4 the bioavailability of ptes was extracted by dtpa cacl2 tea solution gb t 23739 2009 and determined by icp ms thermo fisher x2 usa the vegetable samples were washed with tap water to remove the adsorbed soil and particulate matters and then washed twice with deionized water the cleaned vegetables were dried to a constant weight in a drying oven at 70 c the weight loss of these vegetables was recorded the dried vegetables were crushed by a stainless steel mill and digested with mixed strong acids hno3 and hclo4 the content of ptes in the digested solution was measured by icp ms thermo fisher x2 usa the detailed digestion procedures for both soil and vegetable were provided in the supplementary materials the chemical analysis of these samples both soil and vegetable was conducted in triplicate with regent blank and the gbw07413 for soil and gbw10011 for vegetable were used as the standard reference materials for quality assurance and quality control the recoveries of these considered ptes were all within the acceptable range 90 110 the practical limit for analysis of pb cd cu zn ni and cr were 0 036 0 0018 0 029 0 532 0 037 and 0 027 ug l respectively 2 3 assessment of ptes pollution the single factor pollution index p i and nemerow integrated pollution index p n were used to evaluate the pollution level of ptes in these soils according to the description of our previous report yang et al 2022a the p i and p n of each soil sample were calculated according to the follow equations 1 p i c i c 0 i 2 p n p i max 2 p i a v e 2 2 where c i is the individual pte concentration in soil mg kg c 0i is the standard limit of that pte in soil the risk screening values for metals in agricultural soil in china were used in the present study gb 15618 2018 ph 7 5 p imax and p iave are the maximum and average value of p i of these considered metals the division and class of p i and p n were defined according to the description of previous report table 1 zang et al 2017 2 4 bioaccumulation factor the bioaccumulation factor baf was used to determine the accumulation capacity of ptes from soil to the edible part of different vegetables wang et al 2019 the baf index was defined as 3 b f c vegetable c soil where c vegetable is the metal content in edible part of vegetables mg kg fresh weight c soil is the total content of corresponding metal in corresponding soil sample mg kg 2 5 health risk assessment the target hazard quotient hq and hazard index hi were used to assess the non carcinogenic risk of the considered ptes to local vegetable consumers liu et al 2020 the hq and hi index were calculated as follows 4 a d i c i i r e f e d a t b w 5 h q a d i r f d 6 h i i 1 n h q i where adi is the average daily intake of the considered ptes through vegetable ingestion mg kg day c i is the concentration of ptes in edible part of vegetables mg kg fresh weight ir is the estimated daily intake of the vegetables 0 244 and 0 186 kg day were selected for children and adults respectively liu et al 2021 ef is the exposure frequency of local vegetable consumers to ptes 365 days year ed is the exposure duration 70 years for adults and 12 years children kukusamude et al 2021 at is the average time of ptes exposure for non carcinogens calculated by 365 ed d bw is the body weight of the local vegetable consumers kg 15 0 and 63 5 kg for children and adults respectively rfd is the reference dose of considered ptes mg kg day the values for pb cd cu zn ni and cr are 0 0035 0 001 0 04 0 300 0 02 and 0 003 liu et al 2021 hq is the non carcinogenic risk of each considered pte hi is the total non carcinogenic risk of these considered ptes generally the value of hq or hi lower than 1 is presumed has no non carcinogenic risk target carcinogenic risk tcr was used to evaluate the risk of cancer disease to local vegetable consumers due to exposure to ptes liu et al 2021 the tcr value of each carcinogenic element can be added together if there existence multiple carcinogenic elements the tcr value was calculated by following equation 7 t c r e d i s f where sf represent the cancer slope factor of the carcinogenic elements according to previous report cd pb ni and cr were considered as carcinogenic elements and the sfs value were selected as 6 1 0 0085 0 84 and 0 5 mg kg day respectively antoniadis et al 2019 the tcr value lower than 10 6 means that the carcinogenic risk is negligible tcr value between 10 6 and 10 4 means the risk is in an acceptable range tcr value higher than 10 4 means the vegetables consumers have the risk of developing cancer diseases 2 6 statistical analysis all experiment data were statistically analyzed by microsoft excel 2010 and spss 25 0 the non carcinogenic risk of ptes in vegetables was expressed as the means standard deviations the significant test were conducted by one way anova and multiple comparison spss 25 0 tukey p 0 05 the drawing of all charts was conducted by origin 8 5 3 results and discussion 3 1 selected soil properties and contents of ptes in vegetable soil the selected soil properties and contents of ptes in vegetable soil are shown in table 2 the ph of these vegetable soils ranged from 6 86 to 8 61 with a mean ph value of 7 81 indicating that the soil in the study region was slightly alkaline the om content in these vegetable soils ranged from 0 34 to 4 66 with a mean content of 2 52 in our previous study the mean ph and om content of the vineyard soil in the same region are 7 95 and 2 39 respectively which are highly consistent with our present study yang et al 2022a in addition the coefficient of variation cvs of soil ph and om content were 4 92 low variability and 36 14 moderate variability respectively xiao et al 2015 this result implied that different planting structure and agronomic measures just slightly influenced soil ph but seriously influenced the om content in soil duan et al 2020 the contents of ptes in these vegetable soils ranged from 0 14 to 2 16 mg kg for cd 17 40 36 32 mg kg for pb 25 68 74 74 mg kg for cu 58 78 655 22 mg kg for zn 18 99 59 46 mg kg for ni and 48 02 249 62 mg kg for cr with the mean contents of 1 06 39 72 38 47 255 00 27 45 and 61 83 mg kg respectively table 2 the mean contents of these ptes all exceeded their background values except for cr but were lower than the risk screening values defined by the national standard of china gb 15618 2018 except for cd this result indicates that these vegetable soils were mainly polluted by cd in addition the cvs of cd pb cu zn ni and cr in these vegetable soils were 58 90 98 25 23 17 61 21 17 51 and 37 17 respectively with cd pb and zn having the high variability xiao et al 2015 this result implies that cd pb and zn in these vegetable soils differed greatly and had been seriously influenced by human activities another interesting finding is that the mean contents of these ptes except for ni in vegetable soils was lower than that of the vineyard soil in the same region especially for cd yang et al 2022a the mean content of cd 1 06 mg kg was only one third of that in vineyard soil 3 08 mg kg this result can be attributed to the different cultivated crops vegetables have a higher yield and stronger accumulation capacity for ptes compared with grape milicevic et al 2018 you et al 2020 guadie et al 2021 and can also be harvested several times a year long term vegetables cultivation can remove ptes from the soil similar to phytoremediation and reduce their total content significantly 3 2 assessment of ptes pollution in vegetable soil the pollution status of these vegetable soils is shown in table 3 the p i of cu ni and cr in all vegetable soils were lower than 1 and classified in the unpolluted range one soil sample was moderately polluted with pb and other soil samples were unpolluted 2 and 22 out of 73 soil samples were moderately and slightly polluted with zn respectively cd was the main pollutant in these vegetable soils approximately 16 44 27 40 and 19 18 of these vegetable soils were highly moderately and slightly polluted with cd respectively in addition the average p i of these ptes decreased as follows cd 1 77 zn 0 85 cu 0 38 cr 0 25 pb 0 23 ni 0 14 these results further verified that these vegetable soils were mainly polluted by cd many previous studies have revealed that cd could be accumulated easily in edible part of crops ran et al 2016 liu et al 2021 ugulu et al 2021 and the pollution of cd in these vegetable soils may pose health risk to local residents the p n value of these vegetable soils varied from 0 26 to 2 68 with a mean value of 1 33 the numbers of soil samples classified as moderate pollution slightly pollution precaution and safe were 20 20 9 and 24 respectively table 3 fortunately no soil sample was heavily polluted this result indicates that more than 50 of these vegetable fields were slightly or moderate polluted by ptes furthermore vegetables especially for leafy vegetable can accumulate ptes easily chen et al 2021 lu et al 2021 and the content of ptes in vegetables may exceed the national standard of china gb 2762 2017 even the soil just slightly polluted therefore it is essential to monitor the ptes content of vegetables regularly which can prevent excessive intake of ptes through the food chain and reduce their threat to the health of local residents 3 3 bioavailable ptes in vegetable soils the bioavailable ptes in soil ranged from 0 03 to 0 79 mg kg for cd 1 56 28 81 mg kg for pb 1 62 35 22 mg kg for cu 3 80 168 91 for zn 0 12 1 23 mg kg for ni 0 00 0 12 mg kg for cr table 4 with a mean content of 0 29 8 16 7 87 45 51 0 51 and 0 02 mg kg respectively similar to the total ptes contents in vegetable soils the bioavailable ptes in vegetable soil was much lower than those in vineyard soil in the study region yang et al 2022a which further verified that different crop cultivation can significantly influence the accumulation and fractions of ptes in soil zhao et al 2012 although the long term planting of vegetables reduced the total content of ptes in soil the mean activity ratios of ptes bioavailable content total content were 26 07 21 88 19 81 18 08 1 87 and 0 03 for cd pb cu zn ni and cr respectively fig s2 still similar to those of the vineyard soil except for ni and cr this finding suggestions that ptes fractions in soil are dynamic and can be transferred from one fraction to another as the environment changes pueyo et al 2008 hulisz et al 2022 more importantly the activity ratio of cr is 0 03 which was much lower than other metals and can be attributed to the high stability of cr iii in soil environment ju et al 2022 3 4 ptes content in different vegetables the contents of ptes fresh weight in different vegetables are shown in fig 2 the mean ptes contents in cc sp yc wr gr le ci and rs were 0 16 0 10 0 09 0 07 0 10 0 13 0 18 and 0 13 mg kg for cd 0 26 0 34 0 41 0 14 0 31 0 36 0 77 and 0 43 mg kg for pb 0 13 0 15 0 05 0 11 0 14 0 12 0 41 and 0 16 mg kg for cr respectively fig 2a b f apparently the mean contents of cd and cr in all vegetables were within the permissible limits of china 0 1 mg kg in wr and 0 2 mg kg in other vegetables for cd 0 5 mg kg for cr gb 2762 2017 but the mean pb contents in these vegetables exceeded the permissible limits of china 0 3 mg kg gb 2762 2017 except for cc and wr surprisingly cd is the main pollutant in these vegetable soils table 3 and has been considered to be easily accumulated by vegetables guadie et al 2021 ugulu et al 2021 however its mean contents in these vegetables were all within the permissible limits of china contrarily just 1 out of 73 vegetable soils was moderately polluted with pb but the pb contents in 41 out of 73 vegetable samples were higher than the permissible limits of china 0 3 mg kg these results may indicate that multiple factors can influence the accumulation of ptes in vegetables which is well consistent with previous reports gan et al 2017 golia et al 2021 however the mechanisms by which different factors influence ptes accumulation in vegetables require further investigation the contents of cu zn and ni in these vegetables ranged from 0 04 to 0 34 mg kg 1 95 18 61 mg kg and 0 04 0 34 mg kg respectively and the mean contents of these metals in different vegetables varied greatly in fact these metals are essential trace metals for living beings and important in oxygen transport enzyme synthesis and detoxification hu et al 2013 naz et al 2020 however the need for these metals in living beings is very low and excessive intake of these metals will endanger human health mani et al 2021 the contents of these metals in vegetables are not limited in the national standard of china gb 2762 2017 but the fao who set the permissible limits for cu and ni in vegetables as 40 and 10 mg kg respectively alsafran et al 2021 apparently cu and ni contents in these vegetables are much lower than this limit indicating that these vegetables are not polluted by cu and ni furthermore the contents of these ptes in different vegetables varied greatly especially for ci the mean contents of cd pb cu zn ni and cr in ci were 0 18 0 77 1 22 10 99 0 24 and 0 41 mg kg fresh weight respectively which are all the highest among these vegetables and significantly higher than most other vegetables fig s3 p 0 05 this result indicates that the species is a critical factor affecting the accumulation of ptes in vegetables of course the total content of ptes in soil and other soil properties also influenced the content of ptes in vegetables correlation analysis indicated that the total contents of cd p 0 01 pb p 0 05 and zn p 0 05 and bioavailable cd p 0 01 pb p 0 05 cu p 0 01 and zn p 0 01 in soil were significantly positively correlated with their contents in vegetables table s1 in addition cd content in vegetables was also significantly correlated with soil ph these results further verified that the ptes contents in vegetables can be influenced by multiple factors includes vegetable species total and bioavailable ptes content in soil and soil properties gan et al 2017 zwolak et al 2019 3 5 bioaccumulation of ptes in different vegetables the bioaccumulation factors bf of ptes in different vegetables are shown in fig 3 the average bf of ptes in ci was the highest among these vegetables and significantly higher than most of other vegetables p 0 05 but it was still much lower than the report of khan et al 2020 in fact because ci is usually used as a side dish little attention has been paid to its accumulation of ptes rahmdel et al 2018 however the high bf value suggests that long term excessively consumption of ci grown in ptes contaminated region may endanger human health besides that the average bf of different ptes in wr was the lowest and had certain differences with other vegetables but most of these differences were nonsignificant p 0 05 for ptes the average bfs of cd pb cu zn ni and cr in these vegetables were 0 103 0 010 0 016 0 032 0 022 and 0 008 respectively with the bf of cd being significantly higher than other metals fig s4 this result indicates that cd can be accumulated more easily in vegetables compared with other metals which is consistent with many previous reports chen et al 2021 liu et al 2021 dovlatabadi et al 2022 in addition the toxicity of cd is relatively higher than that of other metals yang et al 2022a the high accumulation capacity of cd in these vegetables may pose potential health risk to local vegetable consumers 3 6 health risk assessment the results of non carcinogenic risk via the consumption of these vegetables are shown in table 5 for adults the hqs of individual metals of all vegetables were lower than 1 but the hi of these vegetables were ranging from 0 73 in wr to 2 45 in ci with only the hi of wr lower than 1 for children the hqs of these metals are much higher than that of the adults most of the hqs for pb and cd in vegetables were higher than 1 except for the pb in cc and wr cd in wr and the minimum hi of these vegetables for children was 2 02 which was still much higher than the permission limit hi 1 these results indicate that the local vegetables consumers face a serious risk of noncancerous diseases especially for children in addition the his of both adults and children are mainly contributed by pb and cd with their contributions ranging from 62 37 to 76 13 for adults and 72 20 83 82 for children respectively which are similar with many previous reports zhao et al 2012 li et al 2018 ugulu et al 2021 in fact the mean cd content in these vegetables was all within the national limit standard of china fig 2a but the hq of cd was the most important contributor for hi and even exceeded the safety limit for children except for cc and wr this result indicates that some contradiction may exist between the national limit standard of china and the health risk assessment model and more effort should be made to revise the standard or the assessment model furthermore the health risk caused by different vegetables varied greatly the maximum and minimum mean hi values for both adults and children were found in ci 2 45 and 6 53 for adults and children respectively and wr 0 73 and 2 02 for adults and children respectively this finding suggests that dietary habit may have unanticipated effects on human health the tcr through the consumption of these vegetables is shown in fig 4 the mean tcr values of these vegetables for adults decreased in the following order ci 5 9 10 3 cc 4 3 10 3 rs 3 7 10 3 le 4 3 10 3 sp 3 5 10 3 gr 2 9 10 3 yc 2 6 10 3 wr 2 2 10 3 which all exceeded the acceptable range 1 0 10 4 kukusamude et al 2021 the change order of the tcr values for children is same as that for adult but is much higher more than one order of magnitude fig 4 furthermore the contribution of cd to tcr was 70 83 88 31 for adult and 79 42 91 91 for children respectively followed by cr ni and pb the contents of pb in most of these vegetables exceeded the national standard of china but its tcr contribution for both adult and children was almost negligible lower than 0 5 which further verified the contradiction between the national standard of china and the health risk assessment model based on the results above local residents suffered health risk both non carcinogenic and carcinogenic risk in varying degrees via the consumption of vegetables however this is just one of the pathways for local residents to be exposed to ptes local residents can also be exposed to ptes via consumption of meat wheat rice milk and water khan et al 2013 omar et al 2015 yang et al 2022b furthermore ptes in soil or dust can also enter into human body via ingestion dermal contact and inhalation song et al 2018 tian et al 2020 as a result the integrated health risk posed by ptes to local residents must be greater than our present study and a more comprehensive assessment should be conducted in the future 4 limitations and future research potential toxic elements contamination in soil caused by wastewater irrigation is widespread throughout the world particularly in developing countries the contamination status of ptes in soil and different vegetables in the historical wastewater irrigation region was reported in this study as was the potential health risk to vegetable consumers the findings revealed that the soil in the wastewater irrigation region was still heavily contaminated with ptes even after the wastewater irrigation had been stopped for more than twenty years the accumulation capacity of different vegetables for ptes varied and almost all ptes in these vegetables were within the limitation of china or fao who but they all pose serious risk to local vegetable consumers especially for children however there are still some limitations to this study 1 the closedown of the lead zinc smelter and forbidden of the wastewater irrigation were in 1998 and it is impossible to get the basic characteristics of the wastewater used for irrigation 2 the soil and vegetable samples were collected from different plots and belonged to different families their different fertilization regimes and cultivate patterns may have some influence on soil properties and accumulation of ptes in vegetables but this influence was neglected in addition the historical wastewater irrigation region needs to be further studied from two angles firstly to investigate the change trend of ptes in soil irrigation water and various crops wheat corn vegetables and fruits in the study region and assess the comprehensive health risk of ptes to local residents through multiple exposure pathways secondly to explore the countermeasures for these ptes contaminated soil in historical wastewater irrigation region 5 conclusions in conclusion historical wastewater irrigation resulted in the vegetable soils in the rural urban fringe zone being contaminated with ptes especially for cd the average p i of cd was much higher than other metals and more than 50 of these soil samples were slightly or moderately polluted by ptes the activity ratio of these ptes decreased as follows cd pb cu zn ni cr although the bf of cd in these vegetables is much higher than that of other metals just the mean content of pb in these vegetables exceeded the national limit standard of china risk assessment revealed that local vegetable consumers suffered serious potential health risk with ci being the highest in addition pb and cd was the major contributors to hi cd was the major contributor to tcr the results of present study suggested that more attention should be paid to ptes in vegetables planted in rural urban fringe zone and effective measures should be implemented by local government to reduce the potential health
