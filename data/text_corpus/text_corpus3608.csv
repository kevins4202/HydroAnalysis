18040,in the more than 15 years since its introduction quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra has become a widely used technique for assessing population health risk posed by waterborne pathogens however the variation in approaches taken for qmra in relation to drinking water supply is not well understood this systematic review identifies categorises and critically synthesises peer reviewed and academic case studies of qmra implementation for existing distributed public drinking water supplies thirty nine english language peer reviewed and academic studies published from 2003 to 2019 were identified key findings were synthesised in narrative form the overall designs of the included studies varied widely as did the assumptions used in risk calculation especially in relation to pathogen dose there was also substantial variation in the degree to which the use of location specific data weighed with the use of assumptions when performing risk calculation in general the included studies complexity did not appear to be associated with greater result certainty factors relating to pathogen dose were commonly influential on risk estimates whereas dose response parameters tended to be of low relative influence in two of the included studies use of the susceptible fraction factor was inconsistent with recognised guidance and potentially led to the underestimation of risk while approaches and assumptions used in qmra need not be standardised improvement in the reporting of qmra results and uncertainties would be beneficial it is recommended that future authors consider the water supply qmra reporting checklist developed for the current review consideration of the broad types of uncertainty relevant to qmra is also recommended policy makers should consider emergent discussion on acute microbial health based targets when setting normative guidelines the continued representation of qmra case studies within peer reviewed and academic literature would also enhance future implementation further research is needed on the optimisation of qmra resourcing given the application context graphical abstract image 1 keywords quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra systematic review drinking water distributed water supply 1 introduction public drinking water supplies have a crucial role in protecting public health access to a safe and adequate drinking water supply prevents a massive disease burden that would otherwise occur bartram and cairncross 2010 hunter et al 2010 yet the microbial safety of drinking water supplies remains a matter for continued improvement globally distributed water supplies still represent a significant exposure route for faecal derived human pathogens in less developed settings against common expectation serious contamination in more developed settings also still occurs hrudey and hrudey 2004 2007 for example water treatment processes and management practices may not be commensurate with the increased risk associated with extreme weather conditions khan et al 2015 and imperfect distribution system integrity can cause exposure of consumers to pathogens regardless of water treatment säve söderbergh et al 2017 viñas et al 2019 water supply is understood to contribute to a baseline of sporadic undetectable cases even under ideal operating conditions bylund et al 2017 colford et al 2009 westrell 2004 reduction of pathogens in drinking water is achieved through controlled physicochemical water treatment processes hijnen and medema 2010 howe et al 2012 with removal typically measured in terms of logarithmic reduction even with the most effective existing treatments the total removal of pathogens can be approached but probabilistically never achieved further insufficient analytical sensitivity means that the assurance of drinking water safety cannot confidently be based on the non detection of pathogens from laboratory analyses of water samples signor and ashbolt 2006 this is a contributing reason for why routine monitoring of specific microbial pathogens in treated drinking water is not recommended nhmrc nrmmc 2011 clinical practice and public health surveillance systems are also insufficient to detect all but the highest levels of pathogens and water supply related illness outbreaks sinclair et al 2005 because public drinking water supplies involve broad public exposure the ability to observe all but the most extreme of associated disease outbreaks is highly likely to be masked by the inability to differentiate water associated cases from cases arising from other causes haas et al 1996 westrell 2004 still a high level of sensitivity is required to demonstrate adherence to commonly adopted health based targets for the microbial safety of drinking water including the 1 in 10 000 annual risk of infection and the 10 6 disability adjusted life years daly person 1 year 1 health canada 2019 usepa 2006 who 2011 to this end the quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra technique enables the estimation of potential health risk consequential to any exposure severity the approach reflects that for the assessment of health risk from carcinogens and toxins nrc 1983 and is comprised of four key stages being problem formulation exposure assessment health effects assessment and risk characterisation haas et al 2014 who 2016 these stages integrate scientific understanding of pathogens their fate and transport through natural and engineered systems and their routes to human exposure and consequential disease who 2016 importantly qmra can account for the exposure of large populations to very low levels of pathogens which typifies the risk profile of distributed water supplies this is facilitated by the dose response assessment part of the health effects assessment being centred on single hit theory which assumes that the chance of each organism reaching the target organ and causing infection or disease is non zero and independent of that of the other organisms present haas 1983 nilsen and wyller 2016 qmra has been a widely recognised practice since at least 2004 it sits within a spectrum of risk assessment approaches available to be used as part of the water safety plan approach to drinking water quality management fitzgerald et al 2018 health canada 2018 medema and ashbolt 2006 murphy et al 2014 who 2011 2016 and a consensus on the broad approach has been established e g ephc et al 2006 haas et al 2014 health canada 2018 who 2011 2016 wsaa 2015 however in the more than 15 years since its broad introduction a range of qmra approaches are applied by practitioners which differ at the detailed assumption level a systematic review of qmra application for drinking water supplies is required to summarise the current state of the field with the primary study objective to examine variation in the application of assumptions and resultant impact on qmra outcomes three key related areas are examined i the current range of approaches to qmra implementation taken for drinking water supplies as represented by peer reviewed and academic literature ii whether the qmra study designs particularly study complexity have been commensurate with what is required to know whether the water is safe and iii whether a consensus position has emerged on a preferable balance between the location specific empirical data and default modelling assumptions used in qmra systematic review is ideal to address these questions it is a technique used to map the different localities subjects variables and results that are available in literature pickering and byrne 2014 to identify outcomes of immediate relevance to practitioners and to reduce biases the current review focuses on real life case studies the criterion of including only peer reviewed and academic literature is deemed an acceptable benchmark to ensure study quality as a secondary review objective the current study design provides an opportunity to summarise the health risk estimates reported by the in scope literature as the quality of drinking water supply is a key element of societal development tracking of these results against the defined human development index is also of interest based on the critical review outcomes considerations relating to the approaches taken for qmra as implemented in real world supply systems are identified to guide future qmra application 2 method peer reviewed and academic literature describing case studies implementing qmra for existing distributed public drinking water supplies were identified categorised and critically synthesised the review was guided by pickering and byrne 2014 and was in accordance with the preferred reporting for systematic reviews and meta analyses prisma statement moher et al 2009 and checklist supplement a registration of the systematic review protocol was deemed unnecessary due to its relatively small scale 2 1 study selection 2 1 1 inclusion criteria as the overarching study objective was to examine the variation in applications of qmra relevant to water supply three important selection criteria were imposed these criteria were devised to identify the most robust and peer accepted cases of qmra implementation whilst representing a breadth of implementation approaches immediately applicable to practitioners first the review focused exclusively on real life scenarios of consumers being supplied by drinking water distribution systems only case studies demonstrating the application of qmra to actual operational systems were included this criterion is based on the notion that approaches taken in current water supply systems are likely to be of greatest relevance to practitioners second because of the focus on real life exposure scenarios only those case studies deriving dose assumptions based on empirical microbial observations at the study site were included this criterion was to focus inclusion on studies with a high level of robustness given the importance of site specific microbial data in qmra implementation petterson and ashbolt 2016 who 2016 studies were included regardless of whether they involved direct observation of reference pathogens or the observation of microbial indicators or surrogates that were later converted to assumed reference pathogen dose inclusion was also regardless of whether dose assumptions were based on the quality of water immediately following water treatment or whether dose also or solely considered risk of distribution third only peer reviewed journal articles and academic theses were included the peer and academic review processes are expected to have focused the identification of studies on those of a high level of rigour because peer reviewed journal articles and academic theses are inherently biased towards representing novel content this criterion still allowed for a breadth of approaches applied to drinking water supplies to be included initial literature identification involved searches of scholarly databases pubmed scopus and web of science title and abstract text were queried for the terms water and quantitative microbial risk assessment or qmra the query terms were deliberately broad to avoid potential issues raised by inconsistent or lack of detail in terminology and thus maximise the identification of relevant literature search conditions included original english language peer reviewed journal articles and master s and doctoral theses with a publication date from january 2003 to october 2019 the publication date lower bound was selected on the rationale of capturing the contemporary approach of preventive risk management and microbial health based targets for drinking water safety which were primarily included in the third edition of the who 2004 guidelines for drinking water quality the initial identification of theses was performed using the bielefeld academic search engine base database using the same query conditions as the option to search abstract was not available search queries applied to the entire document screening involved the removal of duplicate records and inspection of the title and abstract where available regardless of whether full text was immediately available such that only records potentially meeting the inclusion criteria were included studies were deemed eligible for inclusion through inspection of the full text version 2 1 2 exclusion criteria records found to not meet the inclusion criteria were excluded thus narrative reviews hypothetical case studies conceptual models and analyses that were pilot scale or desktop based were excluded analysis of exposure routes where the water was no longer representative of the distributed supply were excluded such as analyses of spa baths and splash parks analyses involving wastewater and water recycling schemes were not included unless the schemes articulated into a drinking water supply system analyses of decentralised schemes e g involving roof harvest rainwater or well water and of point of use and home water treatment practices were excluded studies measuring the indirect effects of intermittent access to water supply were excluded as the current review focuses on quality of the supplied water during times of supply 2 1 3 minimisation of bias risk of bias in the conduct of the systematic review was minimised as guided by popay et al 2006 this included measures to reduce bias in the selection of studies and within the review synthesis bias in the selection of studies was minimised by study eligibility being independently assessed by two reviewers c owens and m angles each reviewer prepared a tentative list of included studies and synthesised discussion points without knowledge of the other s results once completed review outcomes were compared and inconsistencies were discussed until a consensus position was achieved the design of the selection process also focused on including studies with lower potential bias the scope included only existing in situ water supply schemes where empirical observation of microbial quality at the study site was performed this was intended to minimise the number of default literature values in the included qmra case studies the representativeness of which being a major potential source of error when comparing health risk estimates across studies with reference to the secondary review objective studies judged by both reviewers to be of equal technical quality were given equal weight in the discussion residual biases were discussed in terms of an uncertainty typology for qmra bouwknegt et al 2014 knol et al 2009 2 2 data extraction full text manuscripts of eligible records were obtained data were extracted for the application locality unit processes comprising the treatment train relevant to pathogen reduction summary exposure route reference organisms reference levels of risk used dose response models and cited source health effects assumptions sensitivity analyses performed and whether qmra was used as an input or is informed by the output of other models for this purpose a checklist for reporting on water supply qmra was developed supplement b key findings were summarised water treatment processes that were not directly for the reduction of pathogens were not extracted thus processes for secondary disinfection aesthetic and physical quality fluoridation and pre requisites supporting the effectiveness of treatment such as ph adjustment were not extracted 2 3 synthesis the included studies were subject to structured narrative synthesis through textual description tabulation and thematic analysis as guided by popay et al 2006 thematic analysis focused on characterising the breadth of choices that can be made in qmra implementation the themes were the included studies consideration of exposure routes reference pathogens indicator and surrogate organisms dose response models methods for estimating health risk reference levels of risk incorporation of high risk events the interfacing of models with qmra the approach to sensitivity analysis and approach to the recognition of potential biases the secondary study outcomes i e performance against health based targets and tracking with development settings were examined through the application of a common rubric this took the form of forest plots grouped by exposure scenario and ranked by the human development index of the study locality according to undp 2018 the representation of different development settings was also compared to expected proportions based on world population using exact multinomial and pairwise exact binomial tests with bonferroni correction using r 3 6 1 and the emt 1 1 package a significance level α of 0 05 was used for all statistics topics were identified for further critical discussion first the primary review objective and associated focus areas were discussed with reference to the included studies second the influence of qmra input factors was discussed based on the synthesis of the included studies sensitivity analyses third themes derived from the included studies overall designs were discussed finally the secondary study outcomes were discussed 3 results 3 1 study selection using the described search strategy 1264 records were identified as of potential relevance of these 584 46 were non duplicates and 39 3 were included in this review the most common reason for exclusion during the screening stage was due to studies not reporting on a public drinking water supply during the eligibility stage the most common reason for exclusion was due to studies not using empirical site specific microbial data the study inclusion results fig 1 were mutually agreed by the two independent reviewers the two reviewers had no outstanding divergent views 3 2 study characteristics of the 39 included studies categorised in table 1 35 90 were in the form of peer reviewed journal articles and four 10 were academic theses the journal articles were published in 16 different peer reviewed journals 3 2 1 publication date the number of publications by year fig 2 indicates that there were fewer than 10 peer reviewed and academic studies applying qmra to empirical data of drinking water supplies for any given year since 2003 3 3 results of primary review objective qmra implementation approaches approaches taken for qmra implementation were synthesised under the themes of exposure routes section 3 3 1 reference pathogens section 3 3 2 indicator and surrogate organisms section 3 3 3 dose response models section 3 3 4 estimation of public health risk section 3 3 5 and reference levels of risk section 3 3 6 aspects of broader study design were synthesised under the themes of the incorporation of high risk events section 3 3 7 the interfacing of models with qmra section 3 3 8 the approach to sensitivity analysis section 3 3 9 and approaches to the recognition of potential biases section 3 3 10 the included studies approaches were tabulated under the themes of major exposure assumptions supplement c dose response models supplement d and health effects assumptions supplement e other factors contributing to the application of qmra such as pathogen recovery infectivity and viability supplement c and the use of pathogens and indicators and assumptions on treatment process efficiency supplement c were also summarised 3 3 1 exposure routes the majority of the included studies focused strongly on the conveyance of pathogens from source water through the water supply system to the consumer table 1 only two studies considered other major exposure routes van lieverloo et al 2007 who focused on risk arising from ingress to the distribution network subsequent to water treatment and sharaby et al 2019 who focused on legionella pneumophila inhabiting the distribution system all included studies considered the intentional ingestion of drinking water leading to gastrointestinal illness except sharaby et al 2019 who focused on inhalation of aerosols leading to legionnaires disease four studies 10 of those included covered inadvertent forms of human exposure to drinking water including from bathing toothbrushing and inhalation table 1 in total more than 360 water supply systems fell within scope table 1 almost half of the included studies analysed more than one system n 16 41 of the included studies thirty one of the included studies 79 described the involvement of surface water in the exposure route three 8 considered aquifer infiltration four 10 addressed the influence of treated wastewater and seven 18 did not describe the source water type or it was not relevant 3 3 2 reference pathogens a range of reference pathogens were used in the included studies table 1 thirteen major reference pathogens were represented and most studies analysed risk for multiple reference pathogens n 25 64 of the included studies table 1 the most frequently used was cryptosporidium used in 26 publications 30 of total reference pathogen uses by publication and the only other protozoal reference pathogen used was giardia used in 17 publications 20 of reference pathogen uses by publication fig 3 all studies assessing giardia also assessed cryptosporidium except one rodriguez alvarez et al 2015 due to local regulations focusing on giardia of the bacterial reference pathogens used escherichia coli was most common used in 12 publications 14 of reference pathogen uses by publication fig 3 its use was reported at the species level as pathogenic e coli e coli o157 e coli o157 h7 and as the enterotoxigenic pathotype rotavirus was the most commonly used viral reference pathogen used in seven publications 8 of total reference pathogen uses by publication fig 3 detail on pathogen recovery viability and infectivity and other microbiological factors relevant to the exposure assessment were reported to varying extents supplement c these and related terms were occasionally used in inconsistent senses across studies refer to discussion 3 3 3 indicator and surrogate organisms the use of indicator organisms to represent the occurrence of pathogens was considered moderate with 17 44 of the included studies making clear reference to their use at some point in the exposure route supplement c the most commonly used indicators were faecal coliforms and e coli use of surrogate organisms which model the fate of pathogens sinclair et al 2012 for the estimation of treatment efficiency was described in six 15 of the included studies supplement c there was little commonality in the approaches taken refer to supplement c 3 3 4 dose response models dose response models and parameters where stated followed literature precedents supplement d except for nine instances the probability of infection for a given dose was found using either the exponential or beta poisson approximation models haas et al 1996 2014 for the nine other cases the exact beta poisson model nilsen and wyller 2016 schijven et al 2015 teunis and havelaar 2000 was used in six cases and the low dose approximation method who 2016 was used in three cases 3 3 5 estimation of population health risk almost half n 18 46 of the included studies estimated population disease burden as the health risk outcome the remaining studies n 21 54 of the included studies focused on the probability of infection population disease burden was found by accounting for the conditional events of disease aetiology following infection main assumptions summarised in supplement e these events include the probability of illness given infection the fraction of the population susceptible used in some cases and the disease burden per case of illness all of which are multiplied with the result of the dose response model notably of the studies that incorporated population susceptibility n 8 21 of the included studies two distinct approaches were taken the first usage type occurring in six 15 of the included studies accounted for susceptibility in the exposed population based on factors such as life stage and immune status the second usage occurring in two 5 of the included studies accounted for a fraction of the population not exposed either geographically relative to the total population in a region or temporally accounting for extended periods of supply interruption 3 3 6 reference levels of risk the included studies compared qmra results to nine distinct reference levels of risk fig 4 all but four 10 of the included studies used the annual probability of infection of less than 10 4 or the annual disease burden of less than 10 6 disability adjusted life years daly person 1 year 1 or both fig 4 two studies expressed the 10 6 daly person 1 year 1 target in terms of pathogen log reduction values krkosek et al 2016 sokurenko 2014 fig 4 reported log reduction values represented the required treatment efficiencies for cryptosporidium giardia and viruses based on source water risk for assurance that the health target was met daily reference levels of risk were used to account for acute extreme events which may otherwise be offset in the annualisation of risk fig 4 they were used by smeets et al 2008 taghipour et al 2019 and tolouei et al 2019 the probability of infection of 2 74 10 7 per day and the disease burden of 2 74 10 9 per day were used based on the 10 4 and 10 6 annual targets respectively being divided into constituent days adherence to this daily level over a year will result in the annual target being met the probability of infection of 365 10 4 per day was also used by smeets et al 2008 to represent the annual target of 10 4 being breached within one day two studies used less stringent targets modifying for local context fig 4 bartak et al 2015 chose levels that corresponded to the national and regional diarrhoeal burden and machdar et al 2013 used the targeted annual burden of disease of less than 10 4 daly person 1 year 1 on the basis that this target may be more realistic for the setting as discussed by who 2011 3 3 7 incorporation of high risk events high risk events were represented in many of the included studies they often related to contamination events in source water perturbances to water treatment operations or acute cases of network ingress rainfall runoff leading to acute source water contamination was examined by numerous authors and was generally found to be highly influential on estimated health risk for example signor et al 2007 found that such events in this case occurring for 14 per cent of a year were attributable to most of the annual infection risk for the reference pathogens cryptosporidium and giardia the case study by smeets et al 2008 showed that annual infection risk was dominated by the top 3 to 10 per cent of the highest monitoring results for campylobacter thought to occur due to introduction of faecal contamination from local wildlife especially after rainfall the effect of wastewater discharge events upstream of drinking water abstraction was also a topic of investigation tolouei et al 2019 estimated that wastewater treatment bypasses as well as rainfall induced contamination from unquantified faecal sources led to a 1 log10 increase in health risk similarly taghipour et al 2019 assessed the effects of acute overflows of combined stormwater and sewer upstream of drinking water treatment abstraction points finding that the health risk of the plant closer to discharge points was more influenced by the number of overflow events importantly åström et al 2007 estimated a reduction in annual health risk resulting from contemporaneous knowledge and active avoidance of such events the result was greater than could be achieved through relying on the microbial analysis of intake water the ongoing stability of drinking water treatment processes was found to be an important factor affecting health risk in further analysis of data presented by howard et al 2006 hunter et al 2009 found that the annual health benefits attributable to improved drinking water supply are almost entirely lost by a few days consumption of untreated water xiao et al 2012 found that performance of water treatment unit processes most affected health risk with the stability of the filtration process having the greatest impact in a potable water recycling case study by ander and forss 2011 typical water treatment failure modes and rates deemed realistic were found to contribute to an increase in health risk similarly treatment failure scenarios analysed by hamouda et al 2016 led to estimated levels of risk above the tolerable level van lieverloo et al 2007 performed the only analysis of acute network ingress events finding relatively high associated risk though this was subject to substantial uncertainties other studies accounted for network ingress in effect by including monitoring of the distribution system e g george et al 2015 though this may have accounted for baseline recontamination rather than acute high risk disturbances in the distribution network 3 3 8 model interfaces six 15 of the included studies described qmra directly interfacing with other models table 2 ander and forss 2011 used fault tree analysis to define water treatment failure scenarios which then defined part of the problem formulation under qmra health risk estimates for each scenario were used to prioritise improvement across the fault causes machdar et al 2013 used qmra output as an input to economic models with health risk estimates informing cost effectiveness analyses a range of engineering and programmatic interventions were examined using daly gained as the numerator and a monetary denominator sokolova et al 2015 taghipour et al 2019 and tolouei et al 2019 each used hydrodynamic models to estimate point source inputs relevant to source water pathogen loading for qmra baseline conditions and loading events from rainfall and wastewater discharge events upstream of the drinking water treatment plant were modelled swaffer et al 2018 modelled associations between livestock stocking characteristics and pathogen load which informed the assumptions used in the exposure assessment 3 3 9 approaches to sensitivity analysis nine 23 of the included studies described the relative influence of some or all qmra input factors on health risk estimates through formal approaches to sensitivity analysis table 3 source water pathogen load and treatment efficiency were frequently reported as of highest influence on health risk estimates the test most prevalent n 6 uses 67 of the studies performing formal sensitivity analysis was the ranked correlation coefficient other methods used were differential analysis factor sensitivity coefficient and the pairwise comparison of factors using surface plots n 1 for each approach respectively 11 each respectively of the studies performing formal sensitivity analysis less formal approaches for testing the relative impact of changes to assumptions were also used in numerous included studies summarised in supplement c however there was inconsistency in associated terminology some were identified as sensitivity analysis and some were not and there was a greater subjectivity in the rationales for performing these analyses each answering a distinct research question 3 3 10 risk of bias the included studies did not commonly discuss the risk of bias nevertheless biases were introduced in the assumptions and measurements made including in the selection of reference pathogens and exposure routes table 1 and in the assumptions made for the design of the monitoring campaign pathogen indicator and surrogate ratios volume consumed and other exposure factors supplement c dose response supplement d and health effects supplement e none of the included studies validated results against surveillance outbreak data though almost none represented declared outbreak scenarios 3 4 results of secondary review objective studies reported results and representation of development settings 3 4 1 included studies reported population health risk with respect to the secondary study objective the included studies reported health risk estimates varied in their adherence to the respective health based target selected included studies key results are summarised supplement f twenty four 62 of the included studies provided results in clear numerical form allowing for comparison of results across the studies results of studies using the two most common reference levels of risk 1 in 10 000 annual probability of infection and disease burden of 10 6 daly person 1 year 1 were benchmarked in fig 5 and fig 6 respectively because these reference levels are approximately equivalent exposure scenarios that very clearly adhere or very clearly do not adhere to their respective reference level are likely to have a similar outcome when expressed in the alternate metric notwithstanding that the metrics are subject to important differences arising from disease severity weightings and other factors relating to health effects of the studies providing numerical results a total of 101 scenarios involving a distinct combination of exposure pathway and reference pathogen were identified figs 5 and 6 of these scenarios cryptosporidium was the reference pathogen that most often exceeded selected reference levels of risk based on median result n 21 scenarios 21 of the analysed scenarios though it was also the most frequently used per study section 3 3 2 e coli and giardia were the next highest exceeding reference levels of risk in n 11 scenarios 11 of those analysed and n 10 scenarios 10 of those analysed respectively all other reference pathogens accounted for the remaining eight scenarios 8 of the analysed scenarios where median health risk exceeded selected reference levels 3 4 2 development settings and reported population health risk the representation of study localities human development index categorised by undp 2018 as very high high medium and low was significantly different to what would be expected if representation followed categories relative proportion of world population exact multinomial test p 0 001 very high human development settings were significantly over represented expected 0 19 observed 0 59 p 0 001 and medium human development settings were significantly under represented expected 0 37 observed 0 15 p 0 005 in both figs 5 and 6 studies were shown in descending order of the human development index of the study locality according to undp 2018 the studies incorporated at the top of fig 5 including those from mohammed and seidu 2019 to sharaby et al 2019 were considered as being set in localities classified as of very high human development of the studies that used annual disease burden fig 6 only the first listed study sokurenko 2014 was set in a locality classified by undp 2018 as of very high human development the remainder of the studies presented in figs 5 and 6 were set in locations of high to low human development a trend is broadly observable suggesting the included studies results are consistent with an inverse relationship between development context and estimated health risk 4 discussion when considering variation in the application of assumptions and impact on qmra concerning the supply of drinking water the available scientific and academic literature currently identifies that i the current range of approaches taken for qmra implementation is broad ii the complexity of study design varies and does not appear to be related to what is required to judge whether the water supply is safe and iii while the approaches taken in the inclusion of location specific empirical data varies norms have emerged in health effects assumptions especially for the selection of dose response models trends in the relative importance of qmra inputs emerged as reflected in the included studies formal sensitivity analyses and in study designs though all included studies examined the microbial safety of respective drinking water supplies approaches taken for qmra implementation were broad with respect to overall study designs and the assumptions used in risk calculation variation in study design was especially evident in the derivation of pathogen dose applicable to exposure for instance in studies that considered it source water pathogen concentration was derived using either pathogen monitoring results or through estimation of the same with microbial surrogate results the latter approach then involved either location specific pathogen surrogate ratios or assumed ratios derived from literature similarly in studies that considered it the efficiency of pathogen removal through water treatment processes was based on either observed surrogate reduction or values assumed from literature many included studies also considered the impact of high risk events with study designs focused accordingly on a broader scale variation in study design was demonstrated through the qmra model interfacing with a diverse range of other modelling approaches including taking inputs from external models in relation to pathogen dose and qmra outputs serving as an input to economic analysis section 3 3 8 overall the demonstrated variation in approaches taken indicates that the qmra method is highly flexible this is an especially beneficial quality for the assessment of drinking water supplies it provides opportunity for even scarce amounts of available data when supplemented with default literature values to be used beneficially albeit in recognition of potential error and biases that may apply there was also substantial variation in the degree to which the use of location specific data weighed with the use of default assumptions summarised in supplements c through e with respect to the use of default literature values strong norms have emerged in the selection of dose response models and other factors in the health effects assessment stage it seems likely that this is due to the limited availability of existing models and a lack of new primary data to do otherwise other than the volume of exposure there was little consistency across studies in the use of location specific data or assumptions for other factors e g treatment efficiency and other major assumptions for dose though the current review was purposefully focused on examining only studies with site specific microbial monitoring data qmra studies can also be performed using assumptions entirely sourced from literature this can be considered as screening level qmra while this approach can appropriately serve the purpose of delineating cases of clearly acceptable or clearly unacceptable risk location specific data are likely the first major area for attention in cases where greater precision is needed in general there was an observed mismatch between study complexity and the purpose being served it was not necessarily the case that increased study complexity increased the level of certainty in outcomes some of the studies highly complex in statistical approach still provided results with a high degree of uncertainty as evidenced by the size of the error bars in figs 5 and 6 further in some cases the level of detail presented in studies did not align with the level of expected risk outcome this was evidenced in the level of detail provided in studies qmra assumptions supplement c and in the sophistication of statistical approaches taken some of the most complex study designs returned some of the lowest risk estimates in systems that would be expected to perform well based on human development status conversely some of the simplest approaches were used on systems in lower human development settings and were sufficient to identify poor risk outcomes this could be due to the relative ease of dealing with the fewer non detect data in higher risk systems it is not clear which approach is the most suitable but it is reasonable to suggest that simpler approaches would be more readily taken up by industry with more complex approaches being warranted for situations where risk outcomes are borderline e g where uncertainty bounds cross the reference level of risk overall there is a need for a consensus position to be established on balancing complexity against accessibility and uncertainty based on the included case studies formal sensitivity analyses factors relating to pathogen dose were consistently of high importance to qmra risk estimates this finding supports the notion that locally appropriate information on pathogen risk is important petterson et al 2015b who 2016 and is a key reason for including this as an acceptance criterion in the study while water suppliers generally have water quality data at their disposal their usage in qmra must be carefully considered the reason for this was clearly shown in quantitative terms by åström et al 2007 where a selective source water abstraction protocol was shown to markedly alter the risk profile such an effect might easily be missed in the design of a water quality monitoring program further capturing such impacts may simply not be the intention of past and present monitoring programs e g a program may intend to characterise the source generally rather than specifically characterise the untreated water as supplied to a treatment plant this strongly suggests that a water quality monitoring program addressing the specific needs of qmra i e to appropriately characterise risk is ideal included studies formal sensitivity analyses also indicated that the impact of the dose response parameters tended to be relatively low despite this it is possible that improvement in these models would provide far reaching benefit due to their largely consistent adoption in qmra implementation qmra fundamentally deals with the modelling of very low doses across large populations whereas existing dose response models rely on the extrapolation of dose response relationships to levels far below what was empirically measured in the original clinical studies haas 1983 teunis and havelaar 2000 while this limitation can be overcome by validating qmra model performance against public health surveillance data validation can only occur retrospectively and for substantial outbreaks for which data are available this approach is also limited by doses being poorly quantified and cases being difficult to follow who 2016 nonetheless qmra has been validated at least in a general sense through retrospective analysis of epidemiological data burch 2019 haas et al 2000 2014 these validation exercises have included outbreaks with mean doses of less than one pathogen per dose thereby providing supporting evidence for the single hit theory underlying the ability to extrapolate the relationships to low dose levels as demonstrated through its exclusion from almost all study designs direct testing of pathogens in treated drinking water was not used to inform the estimation of health risk in many circumstances though potentially counterintuitive this is due to the sensitivity and physical constraints inherent to microbiological analyses under who 2011 assumptions a single sample result equivalent to the targeted health outcome of 10 6 daly person 1 year 1 is one infective cryptosporidium oocyst in ca 7 9 104 l sample volume and is in the same order of magnitude for other reference pathogens this is well beyond current analytical capabilities thus unless there is severe contamination present treated water pathogen data generally lack the power to meaningfully contribute to qmra they may also be insufficient for the consideration of network ingress risks in otherwise satisfactory systems generally data that are uninformative or weakly informative should be avoided in experimental design schmidt et al 2019 and thus other methods such as qmra are needed for estimating the effect of treated water events that are difficult to detect yet of high impact similarly the method used to infer microbial loadings that are below the analytical limit of detection could impact on the risk estimate in this regard smeets et al 2007 demonstrated a 0 6 log10 variation in risk estimate depending on method selected i e substituting non detects with zero log linear extrapolation and substituting non detects with the limit of detection there are numerous academic papers addressing this issue e g canales et al 2018 chik et al 2018 schmidt et al 2013 yet there remains a lack of consensus on how results below the limit of detection should be treated the interpretation and statistical treatment of laboratory analytical results was focused on in many of the included studies and is represented strongly in other qmra literature to support the accuracy of risk estimation measurement errors must be considered when dealing with microbial enumeration methods that involve losses or counting errors schmidt and emelko 2011 analytical considerations for the reference pathogen most seen in this review cryptosporidium were reported with varying consistency for example cryptosporidium counts used in qmra should ideally be adjusted for assay recovery petterson et al 2007 and represent viable human infective oocysts schmidt and emelko 2011 swaffer et al 2018 wsaa 2015 recovery efficiency accounts for the unrecovered fraction of oocysts by adjusting for the loss of known quantities of a positive control e g warnecke et al 2003 with sample specific recovery ideal schmidt and emelko 2011 wsaa 2015 the identity confirmation step rules out organisms that are morphologically similar to cryptosporidium oocysts recognised methods include enhanced characterisation of internal morphology through vital stains and the use of differential interference contrast or phase contrast microscopy grimason et al 1994 smith et al 2002 enumerating viability is an important further step to distinguish between live and dead or fatally injured oocysts petterson et al 2015b and can be estimated through cell culture infection assay johnson et al 2012 similar considerations apply to other reference pathogens e g as described by dechesne and soyeux 2007 lalancette et al 2012 lapen et al 2016 petterson et al 2015a regli et al 1991 schmidt et al 2013 who 2016 in total these steps were not frequently described in the included literature if they were not performed the appropriate estimation of risk is impacted dechesne and soyeux 2007 petterson et al 2015b wsaa 2015 population characteristics and behaviours were found to affect the estimated severity of health risk in the studies which analysed these factors highlighting the importance of centring qmra on the population exposed this is especially relevant in less developed settings where the exposure routes can be more complex and pathogen loadings potentially higher it might be less important in more developed settings where nearly the entire population of a water supply system service area can be expected to be exposed via direct consumption at relatively similar rates the difference in development context and its relevance on population characteristics and behaviours manifested in the design of the exposure assessment in the included studies most studies examining less developed settings accounted for changes to the volume of water consumed in the respective location supplement c which varied for varying reasons distinct health behaviours that represented materially different risks were also important in defining risk in some cases such as the intentional consumption of tap water in the absence of point of use treatment and the incidental exposure to untreated tap water through actions such as toothbrushing as modelled by xiao et al 2012 and xiao et al 2013 in both studies these exposure routes contributed significantly to overall health impact similarly accounting for the immunocompromised subpopulation was influential on overall risk xiao et al 2012 inconsistencies in terminology hindered the comparability of the included studies and in places may have led to the underestimation of risk the most notably confused term was the susceptible fraction recognised qmra guidance e g who 2016 uses this factor to account for the proportion of susceptibility in exposed populations based on factors such as life stage and immune status six of the eight included studies that included the susceptible fraction did so in accordance with this recognised purpose section 3 3 5 though only three used a non unity assumption howard et al 2006 shamsollahi et al 2019 and xiao et al 2012 however two studies used this factor to account for fractions of the respective study populations not exposed either geographically or temporally the adjustment for geographic non exposure accounted for consumers not being supplied by the water supply systems examined the issue would have been appropriately addressed by more clearly defining the exposed population during the qmra problem formulation stage e g by performing individual assessments for the separate water supply systems considered the adjustment for temporal non exposure accounted for interruptions to access to the water supply the desired effect would have been achieved had the relevant exposure frequency be inputted during annualisation rather than using the default value of 365 the effect of either issue involves potential underestimation of annual population health risk the majority of studies included in the current review assessed the performance of water supply schemes against benchmarks for either the annual risk of infection or annual disease burden set in normative guidance e g health canada 2019 nhmrc 2018 usepa 2006 who 2011 section 3 3 6 this raises a pressing policy matter of interpreting annual microbial health based targets when considering acute events the studies included in the current review demonstrated that the public health risk posed by water supply is highly sensitive to relatively extreme though typically acute and infrequent events in source water treatment perturbances and network ingress events rather than the low endemic loading understood to occur as a function of the logarithmic reduction of pathogens during normal water treatment the use of the annualisation process attenuates estimated risk levels where a substantial but temporally acute event occurs critically this could lead to intolerable scenarios being unrecognised as such it is possible therefore that annual metrics may not be the most suitable approach this consideration was addressed in several of the included studies through the use of acute reference levels of risk adapted from recognised annual levels section 3 3 6 while meeting one 365th of the annual level every day for a year has been considered a stricter goal than simply meeting the corresponding annual target sokolova et al 2015 taghipour et al 2019 it is possible that very short term events can dominate the yearly average risk smeets et al 2010 accordingly acute or dose based reference levels of risk might be a suitable future approach it is suggested that policy makers consider the discourse emerging on acute risk in the future setting of normative guidelines the need for water suppliers to plan for and promptly respond to acute events is also strongly reinforced by the review presented there are few examples in current literature which strongly focus on risk as experienced by the population exposed at the point of use this is not unexpected as normative guidance e g who 2016 is relatively less developed with respect to the consideration of distribution system risk in qmra highlighting this only one of the included studies set in developed contexts assessed hazards introduced subsequent to water treatment van lieverloo et al 2007 where distribution system ingress was the central research question only two studies set in less developed contexts performed risk assessment for the distribution system george et al 2015 howard et al 2006 despite a higher occurrence of network integrity issues expected in these settings further though it was often not explicitly stated many of the included studies performed retrospective analysis of monitoring data routinely collected under water safety plans verification monitoring results this introduced substantial contextual limitations in many cases ideally a converse approach would be taken where representativeness of data for the purpose of qmra is prioritised in the design of water quality monitoring programs where resourcing permits consideration of the entire exposure route e g source water treatment and distribution should be made in the development of the qmra problem formulation with site specific monitoring to support this further research is likely required to understand how best this monitoring should inform qmra biases undoubtedly affected all the included studies as qmra is an artificial simplification of natural processes sources of uncertainty are the clearest form of bias however systematic comprehensive qmra uncertainty analysis is generally lacking the types of uncertainty inherent to the technique are numerous and can be considered as comprising the dimensions of location including contextual model and data uncertainty nature including epistemic and ontic uncertainty range statistical and scenario uncertainty methodological unreliability and value diversity amongst practitioners bouwknegt et al 2014 knol et al 2009 while many of the included studies addressed some aspects of this typology usually implicitly none did so with a high degree of systematisation similarly in literature prevalent discussion on the uncertainties arising from water supply qmra focuses strongly on specific limited aspects of the typology such as data uncertainty arising from analytical limitations of pathogen enumeration methods other areas of uncertainty are described less frequently for example system specific epistemic and scenario uncertainties and value diversity amongst practitioners have generally received little attention to date and may similarly bias results with reference to the secondary objective of reviewing included studies reported adherence to health based targets there were mixed results a number of included studies returned health risk estimates that can be considered as being of borderline adherence to the relevant reference level of risk as most assumptions used in qmra are conservative the question is raised of whether borderline intolerable results should result in the water supply being deemed unsafe petterson and ashbolt 2016 highlighted that policy and decision making by regulators and utilities depends on qmra risk estimates being artificially drawn as a thin line where in truth the result is fuzzier due to the uncertainties involved accordingly improved reporting on qmra generally as well as the reduction better assessment and reporting of uncertainties are important goals if the technique is to be further appreciated as valid and useful to this end future authors should consider reporting on qmra assumptions in accordance with supplement b the reported health risks can to an extent be explained by the human development status of the settings represented in the included studies those studies undertaken in settings with higher human development indices tended to present a favourable estimated health risk compared to those in less developed settings this occurred with one major exception the direct potable reuse scheme in windhoek namibia while classified as an area of low human development status its good system performance based on estimated annual risk of infection likely reflects the high level of operational capability and increased international investment placed in this direct potable water recycling scheme nevertheless the results are consistent with the estimates by who and unicef 2017 which showed that in 2015 up to one quarter of the world population did not have access to an improved water supply free from contamination with developing countries most affected of the reviewed literature case studies set in very high human development settings were found to be significantly overrepresented compared to the proportion expected based on world population section 3 4 2 further the proportion of the population serviced by public water supplies is likely to be smaller in settings that are categorised other than very high human development and thus these settings may have been more likely to fall outside of the scope of this review the current review should be read in context of the limitations of the included studies and of the review method the identification of issues for narrative synthesis is at least in part a subjective process popay et al 2006 identification of influential factors on risk estimation was informed by included studies formal sensitivity analyses and though commonalities emerged generalisability is not known additionally specific localities and key research groups were strongly represented which may have biased the representation of approaches taken to qmra implementation similarly the study inclusion process is almost certainly impacted by publication bias by including only peer reviewed literature and academic theses it is accepted that valuable analyses and perspectives are likely to have been missed rothstein et al 2005 this is especially relevant for a method intended for routine use in professional practice however by its nature peer reviewed and scientific literature represents the breadth of current scientific knowledge as such the review scope remained consistent with the main objective of the study to examine the current state of approaches to qmra implementation the strength of the current review is that it followed recognised methods for systematic review the approach included a transparent and repeatable search strategy and study inclusion being performed by two independent reviewers nevertheless the review was constrained by substantial differences in approaches for qmra implementation and reporting accordingly a quantitative meta analysis was not able to be performed instead individual study results were transformed into a common rubric as forest plots which provided a sense for overarching trends such an approach aids the reader in developing a meaningful summary of study results even in the absence of quantitative meta analysis popay et al 2006 to date review of the implementation of the qmra technique has mainly occurred through narrative discourse e g haas 2002 haas et al 2014 hamouda et al 2018 medema et al 2003 petterson and ashbolt 2016 smeets 2019 smeets et al 2010 this systematic review has offered a further perspective 5 conclusion this review showed that qmra has been used in a highly adaptive manner in order to suit available data a critical quality that allows for the customisation of risk assessment to local conditions and available resources however this quality has also inadvertently led to difficulty in interpretation of results and hindered the comparison of case studies further work is needed to improve the accessibility and robustness of qmra results most salient in the current review is improvement in the way by which qmra results and uncertainties are reported while the assumptions used in qmra do not necessarily need to be standardised as study designs vary widely authors and policy makers could consider a degree of standardisation in qmra reporting it is recommended that future authors consider the water supply qmra reporting checklist supplement b developed for the current study as a basis for reporting case study detail consideration of broad aspects of uncertainty such as those contemplated in the described uncertainty typology is also suggested policy makers should consider the application of health based targets to circumstances involving acute risk in recognition of emerging scholarly discourse further research is needed on issues relevant to qmra implementation specifically case studies exploring the optimisation of qmra resourcing given the application context would be beneficial the continued representation of qmra case studies within the peer reviewed and academic literature is also desired so as to furnish further novel approaches for broader industry implementation author

18040,in the more than 15 years since its introduction quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra has become a widely used technique for assessing population health risk posed by waterborne pathogens however the variation in approaches taken for qmra in relation to drinking water supply is not well understood this systematic review identifies categorises and critically synthesises peer reviewed and academic case studies of qmra implementation for existing distributed public drinking water supplies thirty nine english language peer reviewed and academic studies published from 2003 to 2019 were identified key findings were synthesised in narrative form the overall designs of the included studies varied widely as did the assumptions used in risk calculation especially in relation to pathogen dose there was also substantial variation in the degree to which the use of location specific data weighed with the use of assumptions when performing risk calculation in general the included studies complexity did not appear to be associated with greater result certainty factors relating to pathogen dose were commonly influential on risk estimates whereas dose response parameters tended to be of low relative influence in two of the included studies use of the susceptible fraction factor was inconsistent with recognised guidance and potentially led to the underestimation of risk while approaches and assumptions used in qmra need not be standardised improvement in the reporting of qmra results and uncertainties would be beneficial it is recommended that future authors consider the water supply qmra reporting checklist developed for the current review consideration of the broad types of uncertainty relevant to qmra is also recommended policy makers should consider emergent discussion on acute microbial health based targets when setting normative guidelines the continued representation of qmra case studies within peer reviewed and academic literature would also enhance future implementation further research is needed on the optimisation of qmra resourcing given the application context graphical abstract image 1 keywords quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra systematic review drinking water distributed water supply 1 introduction public drinking water supplies have a crucial role in protecting public health access to a safe and adequate drinking water supply prevents a massive disease burden that would otherwise occur bartram and cairncross 2010 hunter et al 2010 yet the microbial safety of drinking water supplies remains a matter for continued improvement globally distributed water supplies still represent a significant exposure route for faecal derived human pathogens in less developed settings against common expectation serious contamination in more developed settings also still occurs hrudey and hrudey 2004 2007 for example water treatment processes and management practices may not be commensurate with the increased risk associated with extreme weather conditions khan et al 2015 and imperfect distribution system integrity can cause exposure of consumers to pathogens regardless of water treatment säve söderbergh et al 2017 viñas et al 2019 water supply is understood to contribute to a baseline of sporadic undetectable cases even under ideal operating conditions bylund et al 2017 colford et al 2009 westrell 2004 reduction of pathogens in drinking water is achieved through controlled physicochemical water treatment processes hijnen and medema 2010 howe et al 2012 with removal typically measured in terms of logarithmic reduction even with the most effective existing treatments the total removal of pathogens can be approached but probabilistically never achieved further insufficient analytical sensitivity means that the assurance of drinking water safety cannot confidently be based on the non detection of pathogens from laboratory analyses of water samples signor and ashbolt 2006 this is a contributing reason for why routine monitoring of specific microbial pathogens in treated drinking water is not recommended nhmrc nrmmc 2011 clinical practice and public health surveillance systems are also insufficient to detect all but the highest levels of pathogens and water supply related illness outbreaks sinclair et al 2005 because public drinking water supplies involve broad public exposure the ability to observe all but the most extreme of associated disease outbreaks is highly likely to be masked by the inability to differentiate water associated cases from cases arising from other causes haas et al 1996 westrell 2004 still a high level of sensitivity is required to demonstrate adherence to commonly adopted health based targets for the microbial safety of drinking water including the 1 in 10 000 annual risk of infection and the 10 6 disability adjusted life years daly person 1 year 1 health canada 2019 usepa 2006 who 2011 to this end the quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra technique enables the estimation of potential health risk consequential to any exposure severity the approach reflects that for the assessment of health risk from carcinogens and toxins nrc 1983 and is comprised of four key stages being problem formulation exposure assessment health effects assessment and risk characterisation haas et al 2014 who 2016 these stages integrate scientific understanding of pathogens their fate and transport through natural and engineered systems and their routes to human exposure and consequential disease who 2016 importantly qmra can account for the exposure of large populations to very low levels of pathogens which typifies the risk profile of distributed water supplies this is facilitated by the dose response assessment part of the health effects assessment being centred on single hit theory which assumes that the chance of each organism reaching the target organ and causing infection or disease is non zero and independent of that of the other organisms present haas 1983 nilsen and wyller 2016 qmra has been a widely recognised practice since at least 2004 it sits within a spectrum of risk assessment approaches available to be used as part of the water safety plan approach to drinking water quality management fitzgerald et al 2018 health canada 2018 medema and ashbolt 2006 murphy et al 2014 who 2011 2016 and a consensus on the broad approach has been established e g ephc et al 2006 haas et al 2014 health canada 2018 who 2011 2016 wsaa 2015 however in the more than 15 years since its broad introduction a range of qmra approaches are applied by practitioners which differ at the detailed assumption level a systematic review of qmra application for drinking water supplies is required to summarise the current state of the field with the primary study objective to examine variation in the application of assumptions and resultant impact on qmra outcomes three key related areas are examined i the current range of approaches to qmra implementation taken for drinking water supplies as represented by peer reviewed and academic literature ii whether the qmra study designs particularly study complexity have been commensurate with what is required to know whether the water is safe and iii whether a consensus position has emerged on a preferable balance between the location specific empirical data and default modelling assumptions used in qmra systematic review is ideal to address these questions it is a technique used to map the different localities subjects variables and results that are available in literature pickering and byrne 2014 to identify outcomes of immediate relevance to practitioners and to reduce biases the current review focuses on real life case studies the criterion of including only peer reviewed and academic literature is deemed an acceptable benchmark to ensure study quality as a secondary review objective the current study design provides an opportunity to summarise the health risk estimates reported by the in scope literature as the quality of drinking water supply is a key element of societal development tracking of these results against the defined human development index is also of interest based on the critical review outcomes considerations relating to the approaches taken for qmra as implemented in real world supply systems are identified to guide future qmra application 2 method peer reviewed and academic literature describing case studies implementing qmra for existing distributed public drinking water supplies were identified categorised and critically synthesised the review was guided by pickering and byrne 2014 and was in accordance with the preferred reporting for systematic reviews and meta analyses prisma statement moher et al 2009 and checklist supplement a registration of the systematic review protocol was deemed unnecessary due to its relatively small scale 2 1 study selection 2 1 1 inclusion criteria as the overarching study objective was to examine the variation in applications of qmra relevant to water supply three important selection criteria were imposed these criteria were devised to identify the most robust and peer accepted cases of qmra implementation whilst representing a breadth of implementation approaches immediately applicable to practitioners first the review focused exclusively on real life scenarios of consumers being supplied by drinking water distribution systems only case studies demonstrating the application of qmra to actual operational systems were included this criterion is based on the notion that approaches taken in current water supply systems are likely to be of greatest relevance to practitioners second because of the focus on real life exposure scenarios only those case studies deriving dose assumptions based on empirical microbial observations at the study site were included this criterion was to focus inclusion on studies with a high level of robustness given the importance of site specific microbial data in qmra implementation petterson and ashbolt 2016 who 2016 studies were included regardless of whether they involved direct observation of reference pathogens or the observation of microbial indicators or surrogates that were later converted to assumed reference pathogen dose inclusion was also regardless of whether dose assumptions were based on the quality of water immediately following water treatment or whether dose also or solely considered risk of distribution third only peer reviewed journal articles and academic theses were included the peer and academic review processes are expected to have focused the identification of studies on those of a high level of rigour because peer reviewed journal articles and academic theses are inherently biased towards representing novel content this criterion still allowed for a breadth of approaches applied to drinking water supplies to be included initial literature identification involved searches of scholarly databases pubmed scopus and web of science title and abstract text were queried for the terms water and quantitative microbial risk assessment or qmra the query terms were deliberately broad to avoid potential issues raised by inconsistent or lack of detail in terminology and thus maximise the identification of relevant literature search conditions included original english language peer reviewed journal articles and master s and doctoral theses with a publication date from january 2003 to october 2019 the publication date lower bound was selected on the rationale of capturing the contemporary approach of preventive risk management and microbial health based targets for drinking water safety which were primarily included in the third edition of the who 2004 guidelines for drinking water quality the initial identification of theses was performed using the bielefeld academic search engine base database using the same query conditions as the option to search abstract was not available search queries applied to the entire document screening involved the removal of duplicate records and inspection of the title and abstract where available regardless of whether full text was immediately available such that only records potentially meeting the inclusion criteria were included studies were deemed eligible for inclusion through inspection of the full text version 2 1 2 exclusion criteria records found to not meet the inclusion criteria were excluded thus narrative reviews hypothetical case studies conceptual models and analyses that were pilot scale or desktop based were excluded analysis of exposure routes where the water was no longer representative of the distributed supply were excluded such as analyses of spa baths and splash parks analyses involving wastewater and water recycling schemes were not included unless the schemes articulated into a drinking water supply system analyses of decentralised schemes e g involving roof harvest rainwater or well water and of point of use and home water treatment practices were excluded studies measuring the indirect effects of intermittent access to water supply were excluded as the current review focuses on quality of the supplied water during times of supply 2 1 3 minimisation of bias risk of bias in the conduct of the systematic review was minimised as guided by popay et al 2006 this included measures to reduce bias in the selection of studies and within the review synthesis bias in the selection of studies was minimised by study eligibility being independently assessed by two reviewers c owens and m angles each reviewer prepared a tentative list of included studies and synthesised discussion points without knowledge of the other s results once completed review outcomes were compared and inconsistencies were discussed until a consensus position was achieved the design of the selection process also focused on including studies with lower potential bias the scope included only existing in situ water supply schemes where empirical observation of microbial quality at the study site was performed this was intended to minimise the number of default literature values in the included qmra case studies the representativeness of which being a major potential source of error when comparing health risk estimates across studies with reference to the secondary review objective studies judged by both reviewers to be of equal technical quality were given equal weight in the discussion residual biases were discussed in terms of an uncertainty typology for qmra bouwknegt et al 2014 knol et al 2009 2 2 data extraction full text manuscripts of eligible records were obtained data were extracted for the application locality unit processes comprising the treatment train relevant to pathogen reduction summary exposure route reference organisms reference levels of risk used dose response models and cited source health effects assumptions sensitivity analyses performed and whether qmra was used as an input or is informed by the output of other models for this purpose a checklist for reporting on water supply qmra was developed supplement b key findings were summarised water treatment processes that were not directly for the reduction of pathogens were not extracted thus processes for secondary disinfection aesthetic and physical quality fluoridation and pre requisites supporting the effectiveness of treatment such as ph adjustment were not extracted 2 3 synthesis the included studies were subject to structured narrative synthesis through textual description tabulation and thematic analysis as guided by popay et al 2006 thematic analysis focused on characterising the breadth of choices that can be made in qmra implementation the themes were the included studies consideration of exposure routes reference pathogens indicator and surrogate organisms dose response models methods for estimating health risk reference levels of risk incorporation of high risk events the interfacing of models with qmra the approach to sensitivity analysis and approach to the recognition of potential biases the secondary study outcomes i e performance against health based targets and tracking with development settings were examined through the application of a common rubric this took the form of forest plots grouped by exposure scenario and ranked by the human development index of the study locality according to undp 2018 the representation of different development settings was also compared to expected proportions based on world population using exact multinomial and pairwise exact binomial tests with bonferroni correction using r 3 6 1 and the emt 1 1 package a significance level α of 0 05 was used for all statistics topics were identified for further critical discussion first the primary review objective and associated focus areas were discussed with reference to the included studies second the influence of qmra input factors was discussed based on the synthesis of the included studies sensitivity analyses third themes derived from the included studies overall designs were discussed finally the secondary study outcomes were discussed 3 results 3 1 study selection using the described search strategy 1264 records were identified as of potential relevance of these 584 46 were non duplicates and 39 3 were included in this review the most common reason for exclusion during the screening stage was due to studies not reporting on a public drinking water supply during the eligibility stage the most common reason for exclusion was due to studies not using empirical site specific microbial data the study inclusion results fig 1 were mutually agreed by the two independent reviewers the two reviewers had no outstanding divergent views 3 2 study characteristics of the 39 included studies categorised in table 1 35 90 were in the form of peer reviewed journal articles and four 10 were academic theses the journal articles were published in 16 different peer reviewed journals 3 2 1 publication date the number of publications by year fig 2 indicates that there were fewer than 10 peer reviewed and academic studies applying qmra to empirical data of drinking water supplies for any given year since 2003 3 3 results of primary review objective qmra implementation approaches approaches taken for qmra implementation were synthesised under the themes of exposure routes section 3 3 1 reference pathogens section 3 3 2 indicator and surrogate organisms section 3 3 3 dose response models section 3 3 4 estimation of public health risk section 3 3 5 and reference levels of risk section 3 3 6 aspects of broader study design were synthesised under the themes of the incorporation of high risk events section 3 3 7 the interfacing of models with qmra section 3 3 8 the approach to sensitivity analysis section 3 3 9 and approaches to the recognition of potential biases section 3 3 10 the included studies approaches were tabulated under the themes of major exposure assumptions supplement c dose response models supplement d and health effects assumptions supplement e other factors contributing to the application of qmra such as pathogen recovery infectivity and viability supplement c and the use of pathogens and indicators and assumptions on treatment process efficiency supplement c were also summarised 3 3 1 exposure routes the majority of the included studies focused strongly on the conveyance of pathogens from source water through the water supply system to the consumer table 1 only two studies considered other major exposure routes van lieverloo et al 2007 who focused on risk arising from ingress to the distribution network subsequent to water treatment and sharaby et al 2019 who focused on legionella pneumophila inhabiting the distribution system all included studies considered the intentional ingestion of drinking water leading to gastrointestinal illness except sharaby et al 2019 who focused on inhalation of aerosols leading to legionnaires disease four studies 10 of those included covered inadvertent forms of human exposure to drinking water including from bathing toothbrushing and inhalation table 1 in total more than 360 water supply systems fell within scope table 1 almost half of the included studies analysed more than one system n 16 41 of the included studies thirty one of the included studies 79 described the involvement of surface water in the exposure route three 8 considered aquifer infiltration four 10 addressed the influence of treated wastewater and seven 18 did not describe the source water type or it was not relevant 3 3 2 reference pathogens a range of reference pathogens were used in the included studies table 1 thirteen major reference pathogens were represented and most studies analysed risk for multiple reference pathogens n 25 64 of the included studies table 1 the most frequently used was cryptosporidium used in 26 publications 30 of total reference pathogen uses by publication and the only other protozoal reference pathogen used was giardia used in 17 publications 20 of reference pathogen uses by publication fig 3 all studies assessing giardia also assessed cryptosporidium except one rodriguez alvarez et al 2015 due to local regulations focusing on giardia of the bacterial reference pathogens used escherichia coli was most common used in 12 publications 14 of reference pathogen uses by publication fig 3 its use was reported at the species level as pathogenic e coli e coli o157 e coli o157 h7 and as the enterotoxigenic pathotype rotavirus was the most commonly used viral reference pathogen used in seven publications 8 of total reference pathogen uses by publication fig 3 detail on pathogen recovery viability and infectivity and other microbiological factors relevant to the exposure assessment were reported to varying extents supplement c these and related terms were occasionally used in inconsistent senses across studies refer to discussion 3 3 3 indicator and surrogate organisms the use of indicator organisms to represent the occurrence of pathogens was considered moderate with 17 44 of the included studies making clear reference to their use at some point in the exposure route supplement c the most commonly used indicators were faecal coliforms and e coli use of surrogate organisms which model the fate of pathogens sinclair et al 2012 for the estimation of treatment efficiency was described in six 15 of the included studies supplement c there was little commonality in the approaches taken refer to supplement c 3 3 4 dose response models dose response models and parameters where stated followed literature precedents supplement d except for nine instances the probability of infection for a given dose was found using either the exponential or beta poisson approximation models haas et al 1996 2014 for the nine other cases the exact beta poisson model nilsen and wyller 2016 schijven et al 2015 teunis and havelaar 2000 was used in six cases and the low dose approximation method who 2016 was used in three cases 3 3 5 estimation of population health risk almost half n 18 46 of the included studies estimated population disease burden as the health risk outcome the remaining studies n 21 54 of the included studies focused on the probability of infection population disease burden was found by accounting for the conditional events of disease aetiology following infection main assumptions summarised in supplement e these events include the probability of illness given infection the fraction of the population susceptible used in some cases and the disease burden per case of illness all of which are multiplied with the result of the dose response model notably of the studies that incorporated population susceptibility n 8 21 of the included studies two distinct approaches were taken the first usage type occurring in six 15 of the included studies accounted for susceptibility in the exposed population based on factors such as life stage and immune status the second usage occurring in two 5 of the included studies accounted for a fraction of the population not exposed either geographically relative to the total population in a region or temporally accounting for extended periods of supply interruption 3 3 6 reference levels of risk the included studies compared qmra results to nine distinct reference levels of risk fig 4 all but four 10 of the included studies used the annual probability of infection of less than 10 4 or the annual disease burden of less than 10 6 disability adjusted life years daly person 1 year 1 or both fig 4 two studies expressed the 10 6 daly person 1 year 1 target in terms of pathogen log reduction values krkosek et al 2016 sokurenko 2014 fig 4 reported log reduction values represented the required treatment efficiencies for cryptosporidium giardia and viruses based on source water risk for assurance that the health target was met daily reference levels of risk were used to account for acute extreme events which may otherwise be offset in the annualisation of risk fig 4 they were used by smeets et al 2008 taghipour et al 2019 and tolouei et al 2019 the probability of infection of 2 74 10 7 per day and the disease burden of 2 74 10 9 per day were used based on the 10 4 and 10 6 annual targets respectively being divided into constituent days adherence to this daily level over a year will result in the annual target being met the probability of infection of 365 10 4 per day was also used by smeets et al 2008 to represent the annual target of 10 4 being breached within one day two studies used less stringent targets modifying for local context fig 4 bartak et al 2015 chose levels that corresponded to the national and regional diarrhoeal burden and machdar et al 2013 used the targeted annual burden of disease of less than 10 4 daly person 1 year 1 on the basis that this target may be more realistic for the setting as discussed by who 2011 3 3 7 incorporation of high risk events high risk events were represented in many of the included studies they often related to contamination events in source water perturbances to water treatment operations or acute cases of network ingress rainfall runoff leading to acute source water contamination was examined by numerous authors and was generally found to be highly influential on estimated health risk for example signor et al 2007 found that such events in this case occurring for 14 per cent of a year were attributable to most of the annual infection risk for the reference pathogens cryptosporidium and giardia the case study by smeets et al 2008 showed that annual infection risk was dominated by the top 3 to 10 per cent of the highest monitoring results for campylobacter thought to occur due to introduction of faecal contamination from local wildlife especially after rainfall the effect of wastewater discharge events upstream of drinking water abstraction was also a topic of investigation tolouei et al 2019 estimated that wastewater treatment bypasses as well as rainfall induced contamination from unquantified faecal sources led to a 1 log10 increase in health risk similarly taghipour et al 2019 assessed the effects of acute overflows of combined stormwater and sewer upstream of drinking water treatment abstraction points finding that the health risk of the plant closer to discharge points was more influenced by the number of overflow events importantly åström et al 2007 estimated a reduction in annual health risk resulting from contemporaneous knowledge and active avoidance of such events the result was greater than could be achieved through relying on the microbial analysis of intake water the ongoing stability of drinking water treatment processes was found to be an important factor affecting health risk in further analysis of data presented by howard et al 2006 hunter et al 2009 found that the annual health benefits attributable to improved drinking water supply are almost entirely lost by a few days consumption of untreated water xiao et al 2012 found that performance of water treatment unit processes most affected health risk with the stability of the filtration process having the greatest impact in a potable water recycling case study by ander and forss 2011 typical water treatment failure modes and rates deemed realistic were found to contribute to an increase in health risk similarly treatment failure scenarios analysed by hamouda et al 2016 led to estimated levels of risk above the tolerable level van lieverloo et al 2007 performed the only analysis of acute network ingress events finding relatively high associated risk though this was subject to substantial uncertainties other studies accounted for network ingress in effect by including monitoring of the distribution system e g george et al 2015 though this may have accounted for baseline recontamination rather than acute high risk disturbances in the distribution network 3 3 8 model interfaces six 15 of the included studies described qmra directly interfacing with other models table 2 ander and forss 2011 used fault tree analysis to define water treatment failure scenarios which then defined part of the problem formulation under qmra health risk estimates for each scenario were used to prioritise improvement across the fault causes machdar et al 2013 used qmra output as an input to economic models with health risk estimates informing cost effectiveness analyses a range of engineering and programmatic interventions were examined using daly gained as the numerator and a monetary denominator sokolova et al 2015 taghipour et al 2019 and tolouei et al 2019 each used hydrodynamic models to estimate point source inputs relevant to source water pathogen loading for qmra baseline conditions and loading events from rainfall and wastewater discharge events upstream of the drinking water treatment plant were modelled swaffer et al 2018 modelled associations between livestock stocking characteristics and pathogen load which informed the assumptions used in the exposure assessment 3 3 9 approaches to sensitivity analysis nine 23 of the included studies described the relative influence of some or all qmra input factors on health risk estimates through formal approaches to sensitivity analysis table 3 source water pathogen load and treatment efficiency were frequently reported as of highest influence on health risk estimates the test most prevalent n 6 uses 67 of the studies performing formal sensitivity analysis was the ranked correlation coefficient other methods used were differential analysis factor sensitivity coefficient and the pairwise comparison of factors using surface plots n 1 for each approach respectively 11 each respectively of the studies performing formal sensitivity analysis less formal approaches for testing the relative impact of changes to assumptions were also used in numerous included studies summarised in supplement c however there was inconsistency in associated terminology some were identified as sensitivity analysis and some were not and there was a greater subjectivity in the rationales for performing these analyses each answering a distinct research question 3 3 10 risk of bias the included studies did not commonly discuss the risk of bias nevertheless biases were introduced in the assumptions and measurements made including in the selection of reference pathogens and exposure routes table 1 and in the assumptions made for the design of the monitoring campaign pathogen indicator and surrogate ratios volume consumed and other exposure factors supplement c dose response supplement d and health effects supplement e none of the included studies validated results against surveillance outbreak data though almost none represented declared outbreak scenarios 3 4 results of secondary review objective studies reported results and representation of development settings 3 4 1 included studies reported population health risk with respect to the secondary study objective the included studies reported health risk estimates varied in their adherence to the respective health based target selected included studies key results are summarised supplement f twenty four 62 of the included studies provided results in clear numerical form allowing for comparison of results across the studies results of studies using the two most common reference levels of risk 1 in 10 000 annual probability of infection and disease burden of 10 6 daly person 1 year 1 were benchmarked in fig 5 and fig 6 respectively because these reference levels are approximately equivalent exposure scenarios that very clearly adhere or very clearly do not adhere to their respective reference level are likely to have a similar outcome when expressed in the alternate metric notwithstanding that the metrics are subject to important differences arising from disease severity weightings and other factors relating to health effects of the studies providing numerical results a total of 101 scenarios involving a distinct combination of exposure pathway and reference pathogen were identified figs 5 and 6 of these scenarios cryptosporidium was the reference pathogen that most often exceeded selected reference levels of risk based on median result n 21 scenarios 21 of the analysed scenarios though it was also the most frequently used per study section 3 3 2 e coli and giardia were the next highest exceeding reference levels of risk in n 11 scenarios 11 of those analysed and n 10 scenarios 10 of those analysed respectively all other reference pathogens accounted for the remaining eight scenarios 8 of the analysed scenarios where median health risk exceeded selected reference levels 3 4 2 development settings and reported population health risk the representation of study localities human development index categorised by undp 2018 as very high high medium and low was significantly different to what would be expected if representation followed categories relative proportion of world population exact multinomial test p 0 001 very high human development settings were significantly over represented expected 0 19 observed 0 59 p 0 001 and medium human development settings were significantly under represented expected 0 37 observed 0 15 p 0 005 in both figs 5 and 6 studies were shown in descending order of the human development index of the study locality according to undp 2018 the studies incorporated at the top of fig 5 including those from mohammed and seidu 2019 to sharaby et al 2019 were considered as being set in localities classified as of very high human development of the studies that used annual disease burden fig 6 only the first listed study sokurenko 2014 was set in a locality classified by undp 2018 as of very high human development the remainder of the studies presented in figs 5 and 6 were set in locations of high to low human development a trend is broadly observable suggesting the included studies results are consistent with an inverse relationship between development context and estimated health risk 4 discussion when considering variation in the application of assumptions and impact on qmra concerning the supply of drinking water the available scientific and academic literature currently identifies that i the current range of approaches taken for qmra implementation is broad ii the complexity of study design varies and does not appear to be related to what is required to judge whether the water supply is safe and iii while the approaches taken in the inclusion of location specific empirical data varies norms have emerged in health effects assumptions especially for the selection of dose response models trends in the relative importance of qmra inputs emerged as reflected in the included studies formal sensitivity analyses and in study designs though all included studies examined the microbial safety of respective drinking water supplies approaches taken for qmra implementation were broad with respect to overall study designs and the assumptions used in risk calculation variation in study design was especially evident in the derivation of pathogen dose applicable to exposure for instance in studies that considered it source water pathogen concentration was derived using either pathogen monitoring results or through estimation of the same with microbial surrogate results the latter approach then involved either location specific pathogen surrogate ratios or assumed ratios derived from literature similarly in studies that considered it the efficiency of pathogen removal through water treatment processes was based on either observed surrogate reduction or values assumed from literature many included studies also considered the impact of high risk events with study designs focused accordingly on a broader scale variation in study design was demonstrated through the qmra model interfacing with a diverse range of other modelling approaches including taking inputs from external models in relation to pathogen dose and qmra outputs serving as an input to economic analysis section 3 3 8 overall the demonstrated variation in approaches taken indicates that the qmra method is highly flexible this is an especially beneficial quality for the assessment of drinking water supplies it provides opportunity for even scarce amounts of available data when supplemented with default literature values to be used beneficially albeit in recognition of potential error and biases that may apply there was also substantial variation in the degree to which the use of location specific data weighed with the use of default assumptions summarised in supplements c through e with respect to the use of default literature values strong norms have emerged in the selection of dose response models and other factors in the health effects assessment stage it seems likely that this is due to the limited availability of existing models and a lack of new primary data to do otherwise other than the volume of exposure there was little consistency across studies in the use of location specific data or assumptions for other factors e g treatment efficiency and other major assumptions for dose though the current review was purposefully focused on examining only studies with site specific microbial monitoring data qmra studies can also be performed using assumptions entirely sourced from literature this can be considered as screening level qmra while this approach can appropriately serve the purpose of delineating cases of clearly acceptable or clearly unacceptable risk location specific data are likely the first major area for attention in cases where greater precision is needed in general there was an observed mismatch between study complexity and the purpose being served it was not necessarily the case that increased study complexity increased the level of certainty in outcomes some of the studies highly complex in statistical approach still provided results with a high degree of uncertainty as evidenced by the size of the error bars in figs 5 and 6 further in some cases the level of detail presented in studies did not align with the level of expected risk outcome this was evidenced in the level of detail provided in studies qmra assumptions supplement c and in the sophistication of statistical approaches taken some of the most complex study designs returned some of the lowest risk estimates in systems that would be expected to perform well based on human development status conversely some of the simplest approaches were used on systems in lower human development settings and were sufficient to identify poor risk outcomes this could be due to the relative ease of dealing with the fewer non detect data in higher risk systems it is not clear which approach is the most suitable but it is reasonable to suggest that simpler approaches would be more readily taken up by industry with more complex approaches being warranted for situations where risk outcomes are borderline e g where uncertainty bounds cross the reference level of risk overall there is a need for a consensus position to be established on balancing complexity against accessibility and uncertainty based on the included case studies formal sensitivity analyses factors relating to pathogen dose were consistently of high importance to qmra risk estimates this finding supports the notion that locally appropriate information on pathogen risk is important petterson et al 2015b who 2016 and is a key reason for including this as an acceptance criterion in the study while water suppliers generally have water quality data at their disposal their usage in qmra must be carefully considered the reason for this was clearly shown in quantitative terms by åström et al 2007 where a selective source water abstraction protocol was shown to markedly alter the risk profile such an effect might easily be missed in the design of a water quality monitoring program further capturing such impacts may simply not be the intention of past and present monitoring programs e g a program may intend to characterise the source generally rather than specifically characterise the untreated water as supplied to a treatment plant this strongly suggests that a water quality monitoring program addressing the specific needs of qmra i e to appropriately characterise risk is ideal included studies formal sensitivity analyses also indicated that the impact of the dose response parameters tended to be relatively low despite this it is possible that improvement in these models would provide far reaching benefit due to their largely consistent adoption in qmra implementation qmra fundamentally deals with the modelling of very low doses across large populations whereas existing dose response models rely on the extrapolation of dose response relationships to levels far below what was empirically measured in the original clinical studies haas 1983 teunis and havelaar 2000 while this limitation can be overcome by validating qmra model performance against public health surveillance data validation can only occur retrospectively and for substantial outbreaks for which data are available this approach is also limited by doses being poorly quantified and cases being difficult to follow who 2016 nonetheless qmra has been validated at least in a general sense through retrospective analysis of epidemiological data burch 2019 haas et al 2000 2014 these validation exercises have included outbreaks with mean doses of less than one pathogen per dose thereby providing supporting evidence for the single hit theory underlying the ability to extrapolate the relationships to low dose levels as demonstrated through its exclusion from almost all study designs direct testing of pathogens in treated drinking water was not used to inform the estimation of health risk in many circumstances though potentially counterintuitive this is due to the sensitivity and physical constraints inherent to microbiological analyses under who 2011 assumptions a single sample result equivalent to the targeted health outcome of 10 6 daly person 1 year 1 is one infective cryptosporidium oocyst in ca 7 9 104 l sample volume and is in the same order of magnitude for other reference pathogens this is well beyond current analytical capabilities thus unless there is severe contamination present treated water pathogen data generally lack the power to meaningfully contribute to qmra they may also be insufficient for the consideration of network ingress risks in otherwise satisfactory systems generally data that are uninformative or weakly informative should be avoided in experimental design schmidt et al 2019 and thus other methods such as qmra are needed for estimating the effect of treated water events that are difficult to detect yet of high impact similarly the method used to infer microbial loadings that are below the analytical limit of detection could impact on the risk estimate in this regard smeets et al 2007 demonstrated a 0 6 log10 variation in risk estimate depending on method selected i e substituting non detects with zero log linear extrapolation and substituting non detects with the limit of detection there are numerous academic papers addressing this issue e g canales et al 2018 chik et al 2018 schmidt et al 2013 yet there remains a lack of consensus on how results below the limit of detection should be treated the interpretation and statistical treatment of laboratory analytical results was focused on in many of the included studies and is represented strongly in other qmra literature to support the accuracy of risk estimation measurement errors must be considered when dealing with microbial enumeration methods that involve losses or counting errors schmidt and emelko 2011 analytical considerations for the reference pathogen most seen in this review cryptosporidium were reported with varying consistency for example cryptosporidium counts used in qmra should ideally be adjusted for assay recovery petterson et al 2007 and represent viable human infective oocysts schmidt and emelko 2011 swaffer et al 2018 wsaa 2015 recovery efficiency accounts for the unrecovered fraction of oocysts by adjusting for the loss of known quantities of a positive control e g warnecke et al 2003 with sample specific recovery ideal schmidt and emelko 2011 wsaa 2015 the identity confirmation step rules out organisms that are morphologically similar to cryptosporidium oocysts recognised methods include enhanced characterisation of internal morphology through vital stains and the use of differential interference contrast or phase contrast microscopy grimason et al 1994 smith et al 2002 enumerating viability is an important further step to distinguish between live and dead or fatally injured oocysts petterson et al 2015b and can be estimated through cell culture infection assay johnson et al 2012 similar considerations apply to other reference pathogens e g as described by dechesne and soyeux 2007 lalancette et al 2012 lapen et al 2016 petterson et al 2015a regli et al 1991 schmidt et al 2013 who 2016 in total these steps were not frequently described in the included literature if they were not performed the appropriate estimation of risk is impacted dechesne and soyeux 2007 petterson et al 2015b wsaa 2015 population characteristics and behaviours were found to affect the estimated severity of health risk in the studies which analysed these factors highlighting the importance of centring qmra on the population exposed this is especially relevant in less developed settings where the exposure routes can be more complex and pathogen loadings potentially higher it might be less important in more developed settings where nearly the entire population of a water supply system service area can be expected to be exposed via direct consumption at relatively similar rates the difference in development context and its relevance on population characteristics and behaviours manifested in the design of the exposure assessment in the included studies most studies examining less developed settings accounted for changes to the volume of water consumed in the respective location supplement c which varied for varying reasons distinct health behaviours that represented materially different risks were also important in defining risk in some cases such as the intentional consumption of tap water in the absence of point of use treatment and the incidental exposure to untreated tap water through actions such as toothbrushing as modelled by xiao et al 2012 and xiao et al 2013 in both studies these exposure routes contributed significantly to overall health impact similarly accounting for the immunocompromised subpopulation was influential on overall risk xiao et al 2012 inconsistencies in terminology hindered the comparability of the included studies and in places may have led to the underestimation of risk the most notably confused term was the susceptible fraction recognised qmra guidance e g who 2016 uses this factor to account for the proportion of susceptibility in exposed populations based on factors such as life stage and immune status six of the eight included studies that included the susceptible fraction did so in accordance with this recognised purpose section 3 3 5 though only three used a non unity assumption howard et al 2006 shamsollahi et al 2019 and xiao et al 2012 however two studies used this factor to account for fractions of the respective study populations not exposed either geographically or temporally the adjustment for geographic non exposure accounted for consumers not being supplied by the water supply systems examined the issue would have been appropriately addressed by more clearly defining the exposed population during the qmra problem formulation stage e g by performing individual assessments for the separate water supply systems considered the adjustment for temporal non exposure accounted for interruptions to access to the water supply the desired effect would have been achieved had the relevant exposure frequency be inputted during annualisation rather than using the default value of 365 the effect of either issue involves potential underestimation of annual population health risk the majority of studies included in the current review assessed the performance of water supply schemes against benchmarks for either the annual risk of infection or annual disease burden set in normative guidance e g health canada 2019 nhmrc 2018 usepa 2006 who 2011 section 3 3 6 this raises a pressing policy matter of interpreting annual microbial health based targets when considering acute events the studies included in the current review demonstrated that the public health risk posed by water supply is highly sensitive to relatively extreme though typically acute and infrequent events in source water treatment perturbances and network ingress events rather than the low endemic loading understood to occur as a function of the logarithmic reduction of pathogens during normal water treatment the use of the annualisation process attenuates estimated risk levels where a substantial but temporally acute event occurs critically this could lead to intolerable scenarios being unrecognised as such it is possible therefore that annual metrics may not be the most suitable approach this consideration was addressed in several of the included studies through the use of acute reference levels of risk adapted from recognised annual levels section 3 3 6 while meeting one 365th of the annual level every day for a year has been considered a stricter goal than simply meeting the corresponding annual target sokolova et al 2015 taghipour et al 2019 it is possible that very short term events can dominate the yearly average risk smeets et al 2010 accordingly acute or dose based reference levels of risk might be a suitable future approach it is suggested that policy makers consider the discourse emerging on acute risk in the future setting of normative guidelines the need for water suppliers to plan for and promptly respond to acute events is also strongly reinforced by the review presented there are few examples in current literature which strongly focus on risk as experienced by the population exposed at the point of use this is not unexpected as normative guidance e g who 2016 is relatively less developed with respect to the consideration of distribution system risk in qmra highlighting this only one of the included studies set in developed contexts assessed hazards introduced subsequent to water treatment van lieverloo et al 2007 where distribution system ingress was the central research question only two studies set in less developed contexts performed risk assessment for the distribution system george et al 2015 howard et al 2006 despite a higher occurrence of network integrity issues expected in these settings further though it was often not explicitly stated many of the included studies performed retrospective analysis of monitoring data routinely collected under water safety plans verification monitoring results this introduced substantial contextual limitations in many cases ideally a converse approach would be taken where representativeness of data for the purpose of qmra is prioritised in the design of water quality monitoring programs where resourcing permits consideration of the entire exposure route e g source water treatment and distribution should be made in the development of the qmra problem formulation with site specific monitoring to support this further research is likely required to understand how best this monitoring should inform qmra biases undoubtedly affected all the included studies as qmra is an artificial simplification of natural processes sources of uncertainty are the clearest form of bias however systematic comprehensive qmra uncertainty analysis is generally lacking the types of uncertainty inherent to the technique are numerous and can be considered as comprising the dimensions of location including contextual model and data uncertainty nature including epistemic and ontic uncertainty range statistical and scenario uncertainty methodological unreliability and value diversity amongst practitioners bouwknegt et al 2014 knol et al 2009 while many of the included studies addressed some aspects of this typology usually implicitly none did so with a high degree of systematisation similarly in literature prevalent discussion on the uncertainties arising from water supply qmra focuses strongly on specific limited aspects of the typology such as data uncertainty arising from analytical limitations of pathogen enumeration methods other areas of uncertainty are described less frequently for example system specific epistemic and scenario uncertainties and value diversity amongst practitioners have generally received little attention to date and may similarly bias results with reference to the secondary objective of reviewing included studies reported adherence to health based targets there were mixed results a number of included studies returned health risk estimates that can be considered as being of borderline adherence to the relevant reference level of risk as most assumptions used in qmra are conservative the question is raised of whether borderline intolerable results should result in the water supply being deemed unsafe petterson and ashbolt 2016 highlighted that policy and decision making by regulators and utilities depends on qmra risk estimates being artificially drawn as a thin line where in truth the result is fuzzier due to the uncertainties involved accordingly improved reporting on qmra generally as well as the reduction better assessment and reporting of uncertainties are important goals if the technique is to be further appreciated as valid and useful to this end future authors should consider reporting on qmra assumptions in accordance with supplement b the reported health risks can to an extent be explained by the human development status of the settings represented in the included studies those studies undertaken in settings with higher human development indices tended to present a favourable estimated health risk compared to those in less developed settings this occurred with one major exception the direct potable reuse scheme in windhoek namibia while classified as an area of low human development status its good system performance based on estimated annual risk of infection likely reflects the high level of operational capability and increased international investment placed in this direct potable water recycling scheme nevertheless the results are consistent with the estimates by who and unicef 2017 which showed that in 2015 up to one quarter of the world population did not have access to an improved water supply free from contamination with developing countries most affected of the reviewed literature case studies set in very high human development settings were found to be significantly overrepresented compared to the proportion expected based on world population section 3 4 2 further the proportion of the population serviced by public water supplies is likely to be smaller in settings that are categorised other than very high human development and thus these settings may have been more likely to fall outside of the scope of this review the current review should be read in context of the limitations of the included studies and of the review method the identification of issues for narrative synthesis is at least in part a subjective process popay et al 2006 identification of influential factors on risk estimation was informed by included studies formal sensitivity analyses and though commonalities emerged generalisability is not known additionally specific localities and key research groups were strongly represented which may have biased the representation of approaches taken to qmra implementation similarly the study inclusion process is almost certainly impacted by publication bias by including only peer reviewed literature and academic theses it is accepted that valuable analyses and perspectives are likely to have been missed rothstein et al 2005 this is especially relevant for a method intended for routine use in professional practice however by its nature peer reviewed and scientific literature represents the breadth of current scientific knowledge as such the review scope remained consistent with the main objective of the study to examine the current state of approaches to qmra implementation the strength of the current review is that it followed recognised methods for systematic review the approach included a transparent and repeatable search strategy and study inclusion being performed by two independent reviewers nevertheless the review was constrained by substantial differences in approaches for qmra implementation and reporting accordingly a quantitative meta analysis was not able to be performed instead individual study results were transformed into a common rubric as forest plots which provided a sense for overarching trends such an approach aids the reader in developing a meaningful summary of study results even in the absence of quantitative meta analysis popay et al 2006 to date review of the implementation of the qmra technique has mainly occurred through narrative discourse e g haas 2002 haas et al 2014 hamouda et al 2018 medema et al 2003 petterson and ashbolt 2016 smeets 2019 smeets et al 2010 this systematic review has offered a further perspective 5 conclusion this review showed that qmra has been used in a highly adaptive manner in order to suit available data a critical quality that allows for the customisation of risk assessment to local conditions and available resources however this quality has also inadvertently led to difficulty in interpretation of results and hindered the comparison of case studies further work is needed to improve the accessibility and robustness of qmra results most salient in the current review is improvement in the way by which qmra results and uncertainties are reported while the assumptions used in qmra do not necessarily need to be standardised as study designs vary widely authors and policy makers could consider a degree of standardisation in qmra reporting it is recommended that future authors consider the water supply qmra reporting checklist supplement b developed for the current study as a basis for reporting case study detail consideration of broad aspects of uncertainty such as those contemplated in the described uncertainty typology is also suggested policy makers should consider the application of health based targets to circumstances involving acute risk in recognition of emerging scholarly discourse further research is needed on issues relevant to qmra implementation specifically case studies exploring the optimisation of qmra resourcing given the application context would be beneficial the continued representation of qmra case studies within the peer reviewed and academic literature is also desired so as to furnish further novel approaches for broader industry implementation author

18041,for decades photolysis and photocatalysis have been touted as promising environment benign and robust technologies to degrade refractory pollutants from water however extensive large scale engineering applications remain limited now to facilitate the technology transfer process earlier reviews have advocated to developing more cost effective and innocuous materials maximizing efficiency of photon usage and optimizing photoreactor systems mostly from material and reactor improvement perspectives however there are also some fundamental yet critical chemistry issues in photo cata lysis processes demanding more in depth understanding and more careful consideration hence this review summarizes some of these challenges of them the first and paramount issue is the interference of coexisting compounds including dissolved organic matter anions cations and spiked additives secondly considerable concerns are pointed to the formation of undesirable reaction by products such as halogenated nitrogenous and sulfur containing compounds which might increase instead of reduce toxicity of water if inadequate fluence and catalyst additive are supplied due to time and cost constraints lastly a critical issue lies in the uncertainty of current approaches used for identifying and quantifying radicals especially when multiple radicals coexist together under changing and interconvertible conditions the review hence highlights the needs to better understand these fundamental chemistry issues and meanwhile calls for more delicate design of experiments in future studies to overcome these barriers keywords photolysis photocatalysis kinetics mechanisms radicals 1 introduction for several decades disinfection of pathogens and treatment of aqueous pollutants by ultraviolet uv based technologies have been of interests to numerous environmental scientists and engineers oppenländer 2003 a number of uv based processes including vacuum uv vuv uv ozone uv o3 uv

miklos et al 2018 depending on the types of lights and the availability of additive and or catalyst uv based technologies can general be classified into three groups 1 light only photolysis e g uv vuv or sunlight which does not employ any additive catalyst to degrade contaminants 2 photooxidation which degrades compounds by adding oxidizing additive catalyst to produce oxidative species like hydroxyl radical oh sulfate radical so4 and chlorine radical cl and 3 photoreduction which removes contaminants by uv induced reductive radicals like hydrated electron eaq hydrogen atom h and superoxide anion radical o2 because of the outstanding performance and operating convenience some uv based advanced oxidation processes aops have been widely accepted in several niche arenas such as producing ultrapure water lee et al 2016 and analyzing aqueous elements scheuer et al 1995 golimowski and golimowska 1996 bendicho et al 2010 embedded in organic compounds e g nitrogen halogen and

detection of total organic halogen tox bu et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 and dissolved organic nitrogen zhu et al 2015 chen et al 2019 hence further expanding the horizons of uv technology in analytical chemistry area however up to date extensive large scale applications of uv based technologies on pollution control in engineering waters e g drinking municipal industrial and swimming pool waters remain limited the abundance of published paper and tested compounds apparently do not alien with the scarcity of photo cata lysis practices the reason of the gap is largely attributed to low light

explanations are provided and some strategic countermeasures are advocated loeb et al 2018 for example pichat 2015 pointed out three barriers related to material s low performance including wasted radicals insufficient contact of pollutant with catalyst and low sensitivity of photocatalyst at visible light region to overcome these barriers the measures proposed include reducing the radicals

element meanwhile some researches highlighted the importance of catalyst recovery and photoreactor design chong et al 2010 ahmad et al 2016 oriented by these strategies it is expected that numerous studies will be motivated to explore more robust innocuous and economic materials in the future mostly from material and reactor improvement perspectives however there are also some fundamental yet critical chemistry issues commonly encountered in photolysis and photocatalysis processes that demand more thorough understanding and more careful considerations e g the complicated effects of ph on system performance and the mechanisms responsible for radicals formation and inhibition table 1 therefore this review intends to summarize some of chemistry challenges currently limiting photo cata lysis applications although many of them are difficult to solve at current stage we hope to raise a more in depth recognition avoid some misuses and misinterpretations and therefore provoke more novel solutions in the future the general topics of interests are outlined in fig 1 2 interference from coexisting compounds for any aop to be used in real water a common challenge is the impairment of degradation efficiency by coexisting compounds such as dissolved organic matter dom and inorganic ions such impairments may either be caused by screening of uv photon undesired competition between uv or radicals with non targeted compound and or inhibition of radical formation table 1 regardless of reason they could decrease system performance and increase cost eventually making the efficiency less appealing hence a thorough and systematic assessment of the impacts of common aqueous components on the photo cata lysis efficiency is necessary here below shows some examples of contradictory or confusing results reported before 2 1 interferences from organics usually the presence of dom can result in significant inhibition of photochemical processes either by light screening effect or via scavenging of oh generated by photosensitizers using atrazine as a practical example although uv s2o8 2 was more powerful than uv h2o2 in degrading atrazine when it was treated alone uv h2o2 outperformed uv s2o8 2 when a mixture of compounds including atrazine methyl tert butyl ether cis dichloroethane 1 4 dioxane and 1 1 1 trichloroethane were treated together antoniou and andersen 2015 the efficiency discrepancy indicates that the susceptibility of each compound was subject to influences by other coexisting organic compounds meanwhile it illustrates the difficulty in selecting the best system to treat target compound under different conditions earlier studies have reported second order reaction rate constants k for a variety of surface water derived natural organic matter nom and wastewater derived effluent organic matter efom reacting with oh which ranged from 1 39 to 2 18 108 m 1 s 1 for nom isolates westerhoff et al 2007 and 2 0 to 4 0 108 m 1 s 1 for efom keen et al 2014 attesting that both nom and efom could inhibit photo cata lysis significantly by acting as oh scavengers for most of target compounds zhu et al 2007 wu et al 2016 lv et al 2017 however there are also studies reporting considerable production of reactive oxygen species ross such as singlet oxygen 1o2 o2 and h2o2 from nom and efom thomas smith and blough 2001 glover and rosario ortiz 2013 sun et al 2015 rosario ortiz and canonica 2016 which are capable of facilitating compound degradations during irradiation process table 2 the coexistence of ros scavenging and generating effects is apparently inconsistent meaning that the diversity of nom and efom property and quantity may complicate the treatability of uv processes and therefore make their applications unpredictable to broad environmental conditions as for photocatalytic process since photocatalysts are more powerful than nom efom in generating radicals it is difficult for nom efom to bring additional beneficial effects to the system therefore the role of nom efom is usually inhibitive and less desirable for practical applications compared to oh 1 9 2 7 ev so4 2 5 3 1 ev has comparable or even stronger oxidizing capability than oh 1 9 2 7 ev whereas less scavenging effect by dom 7 8 107 m 1 s 1 than oh 2 8 108 m 1 s 1 yang et al 2016 hence justifying the development of so4 relevant techniques for degrading trace organic contaminants overall when multiple contaminants coexist in a water with dom the choice of uv h2o2 or uv s2o8 2 is likely determined not only by their own reaction rates with radicals but also by the relative impacts of dom on the radicals and their influences on each other 2 2 interferences from inorganics inorganic components are another pool of compounds known to be reactive with radicals generated in photochemical processes table 2 summarizes some k values for the reactions between typical radicals and inorganic species for example anions like bicarbonate hco3 carbonate co3 2 chloride cl and bromide br can scavenge oh while anions like hco3 cl sulfate so4 2 and phosphate po4 3 can quench both holes and electrons liao et al 2001 chong et al 2010 their oh quenching ability can generally be ranked as hydroxide oh br nitrite no2 cl co3 2 hco3 under identical concentration levels based on their k values table 2 meanwhile fig 2 shows the influences of cl no3 and co3 2 on the so4 indicating that conversion and inhibition of radicals may occur during the process because of the different reactivities of target compounds radicals and anions guan et al 2018 using 1 4 dioxane carbamazepine phenol 17β estradiol aniline and sulfamethoxazole as examples although the orders of treatability were ordered as uv s2o8 2 which yielded both so4 and oh uv h2o2 which generated oh uv cl2 which produced cl and co2 in simulated effluent water uv s2o8 2 was more likely interfered by ph cl and hco3 than other processes fig 3 however the rates of reactions between anions and radicals indicate that so4 should be theoretically scavenged by hco3 cl and oh more slowly than oh table 2 meaning that uv h2o2 is expected to be more sensitive than uv s2o8 2 in the presence of ph cl and hco3 such differences between theoretical estimations and experimental results thus make uv based technologies more difficult to be practiced under conditions simulative of reused wastewater for anions with different reactivities their relative concentrations are expected to play important roles too yuan et al 2011 guan et al 2018 for example a water containing 1 mm cl in acidic condition k oh is 3 0 109 m 1 s 1 is supposed to be more inhibitory to oh than a water with 10 mm hco3 in neutral condition k oh 1 0 107 m 1 s 1 for degradation of target pollutant figs 2 and 3 however most of earlier studies simply compared them at identical levels and seldom mentioned about their concentration effects in addition only a few studies have examined the influences of cations on photo cata lysis for example potassium has much higher light absorptivity 841 m 1 cm 1 at 185 nm ε 185 than that of sodium 0 01 m 1 cm 1 duca et al 2017 meaning that special care should be taken toward potassium when it is used on vuv process in terms of other cations there was a general census reached from earlier photocatalysis studies that cupric ferrous and aluminum ions at certain levels can reduce mineralization rates whereas calcium magnesium and zinc ions impose little changes chong et al 2010 in order to make it convenient for future studies a list of ε 185 and ε 254 values are summarized in table 2 a study evidenced that metal cations could react with reactive species generated from photolysis of dom wan et al 2019 generally the paramagnetic metal cations trivalent chromium magnesium ferrous and cupric ions exhibited stronger inhibition for reactive species such as triplet excited state dom 3dom 1o2 and oh than other cations e g calcium magnesium aluminum and zinc ions wan et al 2019 of all anions special attention should be paid to nox species because of their double edge effects on the one hand uv irradiation of no2 is able to yield oh with the quantum yield of oh φ oh as 1 5 8 0 at 254 350 nm wavelengths mack and bolton 1999 on the other hand no2 features strong scavenging ability on oh k oh 0 25 1 4 1010 m 1 s 1 and considerable uv absorptivity at 254 nm ε 254 13 0 m 1 cm 1 table 2 meaning that the presence of no2 is more likely to inhibit rather than facilitate oh formation to degrade target pollutant fig 2 in contrast although the φ oh of nitrate no3 is similar to no2 being 1 3 9 0 at 254 300 nm wavelengths the ε 254 of no3 3 5 m 1 cm 1 table 2 was much lower than that of no2 and its reaction rate with oh was almost negligible k oh 1 105 m 1 s 1 hence although no3 yields similar amount of oh as no2 no3 screens less photons and consumes less oh than no2 eventually making more oh available for pollutant control than no2 even so a review once stated that neither no2 nor no3 could generate as much oh as h2o2 φ oh 100 mack and bolton 1999 and therefore their potentials in generating oh should not be overstated meanwhile although nitrite is considerably more photoactive than nitrate nitrate is usually more concentrated than nitrite in solution thus compensating it low reactivity notably there are numerous exceptions and unpredictable results documented in previous uv based processes for example the presence of cl might eventually enhance instead of inhibit the removal of target pollutant yuan et al 2011 because the pollutant preferred to react with specific radical e g cl formed by oh in acidic solution reactions 29 30 and 32 in table 1 in another example the inhibitory effects of cl and hco3 on oh were shown to be minor even at very high concentration levels 250 mm liao et al 2001 which apparently disagree with earlier theoretical derivations the lack of inhibition effect from hco3 might due to the formation of carbonate radical co3 from reaction between oh and hco3 although the reactivity of oh is much higher than that of co3 the steady state concentration of co3 is likely higher than that of oh thus compensating for its lower reactivity sánchez polo et al 2013 moreover co3 might be more selective to dom thereby suffering less than oh from the scavenging effect and ultimately enhancing the degradation wu and linden 2010 liu et al 2016b interestingly earlier studies have demonstrated formation of not only oxidative radicals e g cl so4 and oh herrmann 2007 but also reductive radicals e g eaq from uv vuv irradiation of the same anions sauer et al 2004 these contrasting effects require further clarification too in the future 2 3 impacts from additives solution ph and the type and dose of additives are often important operational factors affecting chemical reactions although it is usually difficult to control and adjust ph for treating large amount of water in real practice people investigated it often for sake of better understanding in one exemplary study researchers compared the treatabilities of uv monochloramine nh2cl and uv cl2 for abatement of several wastewater derived compounds i e benzoate carbamazepine and 1 4 dioxane chuang et al 2017 although the results showed that uv cl2 performed better than uv nh2cl at ambient condition the later was ultimately favored because its performance was independent of ph whereas the performance of uv cl2 decreased markedly from ph of 5 5 8 3 the decreased efficiency in uv cl2 at elevated ph was largely attributed to a conversion of cl into oh which was not favored for the selected compounds chuang et al 2017 another study reported similar phenomenon in which cl formed by uv cl2 was more powerful than oh formed by uv h2o2 at ph of 7 0 8 0 but became less capable than oh at ph of 6 0 yin et al 2018 confirming that the relative robustness of cl and oh are highly reliant upon solution ph fig 4 d although some compounds could actually become easier to oxidize at higher ph e g phenols phenolates babuponnusami and muthukumar 2012 the general decreasing trend of redox potentials for ross with elevating ph certainly accompany with decreasing photodegradation ability fig 5 besides the types of additive the dosing amount and dosing mode of additive also add up complexity of reactor operation for example although uv cl2 was shown to be more efficient than uv h2o2 in degrading nitrobenzene at oxidant levels of 0 05 0 06 mm the trend reversed when the oxidants were dosed at 0 15 mm level watts et al 2007 in another study a small amount of h2o2 was added intermittently for multiple times instead of dosing a large amount of h2o2 once at the beginning to enable more efficient oxidation of ammonia by oh wang et al 2017a compared to dosing once such operation may add difficulty to implement it in practice in theory the rate constant of reaction between h2o2 and oh is rapid 2 7 107 m 1s 1 zhang et al 2020 meaning that an excessive amount of h2o2 could scavenge oh in the meantime of producing it and therefore be detrimental to the overall degradation performance goldstein et al 2007 in addition one single compound may trigger formation of multiple radicals with different properties fig 4 for example formic acid fm it can yield either strong oxidative radical oh upon irradiation by uv wang and bai 2016 or strong reductive radical co2 upon exposure to uv s2o8 2 gu et al 2017c although the formation of reductive species might somehow be explained by hydrogen h atom abstraction of formate from organic radicals i e hcoo r co2 rh it is hard to understand why adding a strong oxidant s2o8 2 into a uv system would facilitate formation of reductive species like co2 in brief summary earlier studies mostly demonstrated the promising sides of proposed photo cata lysis technologies but seldom examined the harmful effects of coexisting compounds on the performance of selected systems while many individual studies have pioneering demonstrated the diversity and robustness of many photo cata lysis systems a bigger and whole picture should be made to cover not only promising but also unsatisfying sides in the future it would be necessary to apply a list of interfering compounds in water to verify the photo cata lysis ability in more realistic conditions particularly we agree with an earlier proposal von gunten 2018 that it is important to compare emerging technologies with established benchmark technologies e g ozone and uv h2o2 in terms of energy demands economics and the possibilities of integration into existing water treatment systems in theory it is also crucial to have an in depth investigation of the interfering mechanisms imposed by different types of compounds 3 formation of undesirable byproducts in addition to degradation efficiency issues another major barrier hindering the acceptance of uv driven technologies is their potential formation of undesirable compounds von gunten 2018 since most of uv processes cannot completely mineralize contaminants mostly due to energy and cost constraints their photogenerated intermediates and end products inevitably arouse concerns zare afifi and blatchley 2016 especially when the process is followed by other treatment processes in this review we present some examples of studies table 3 to help support the opinions as shown below rather than summarize all evidences reported before because many of them are already reviewed in two recent articles ike et al 2019a 2019b according to the application modes of photolysis and redox practices we classify earlier studies into two categories one uses uv process as a pretreatment approach prior to redox process e g chlorination or chloramination namely sequential uv redox process and the other uses uv and redox compound e g disinfectant sulfite together and simultaneously namely simultaneous uv redox process 3 1 sequential uv redox processes for all uv processes the common side effect of uv irradiation is formation of relatively smaller molecular weight mw compounds like ketones aldehydes and carboxylic acids which can serve as precursors of halogenated disinfection byproducts dbps in ensuing chlor am ination processes the types of lights evaluated before include uv mpuv pulsed uv vuv and sunlight while the additives examined already focus on the uses of h2o2 and tio2 the precursors tested before cover from model compounds like resorcinol to typical nom isolates purchased from international humic substances society and sometimes even real water samples the types of dbps studied mostly aim to regulated species such as trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas but relatively less to emerging dbps like nitrosodimethylamine and haloacetonitriles hans table 3 in general the amount of dbps and corresponding toxicities of water increased at low uv dosage conditions i e early reaction period but decreased with further increases of uv dose meaning that there is a possibility of exacerbating water quality along the reaction especially in conditions with insufficient uv dosage in terms of dbps formation trends earlier results vary greatly among studies depending on many operational and environmental factors for example while one study reported less formation of dbps with the use of uv pretreatment zare afifi and blatchley 2016 another study documented elevated dbps formation with the same type of uv lamp cheema et al 2017 meanwhile although uv h2o2 pretreatment decreased the haas formation potentials fps of resorcinol in following chlorination process it increased the haas fps slightly for serine and dramatically for leucine sakai et al 2013 an indicator of the importance of precursor type for a fixed precursor the effects of uv on dbps fps might govern the species of formed dbps in one exemplary study pretreatment of nom via mpuv tio2 h2o2 had led to lower thms fps but remained unchanged for haas fps liu et al 2008 in another pilot scale study both thms and haas fps were promoted with the use of uv h2o2 pretreatment metz et al 2011 serving as an excellent evidence of the negative sides of poor managed uv pretreatment the abovementioned inconsistencies are likely caused by variations of organic type quantity and water characteristics on the dbp formation on the one hand uv based methods could transform high mw hydrophobic compounds into small mw hydrophilic and assimilable compounds liu et al 2002 2008 thus raising the concerns of biological safety of distribution system and formation of secondary byproducts on the other hand insufficient contact time and additive application could result in minor reduction liu et al 2002 or even elevated formation of dbps chen et al 2011 therefore a challenge for future study is perhaps to determine the threshold or boundary separating sufficiency and insufficiency of light and additive dosage 3 2 simultaneous uv redox processes within this category uv cl2 process is a special concern although it is an attractive approach for treating numerous micropollutants recently fang et al 2014 due to its operational simplicity and comparable treatability as uv h2o2 wang et al 2015 the reason mainly comes from its potential formation of toxic assimilable and sensory unpleasant products by cl wang et al 2018 fig 6 for example when uv254 was used to reduce iodate into iodide hypoiodous acid was likely formed and then reacted with nom to form iodinated dbps tian et al 2017 in addition bromide and iodide may be oxidized directly by oh to bromate iodate and bromine iodine and then the latter enable formation of brominated and iodinated dbps von gunten 2003 for this reason uv h2o2 was preferred over uv s2o8 2 for samples containing br because so4 was more powerful than oh in transforming br into bromate and bromine and therefore form more brominated byproducts wang et al 2017b notably uv technologies may also lead to formation of nitrogenous dbps wang et al 2015 cheema et al 2017 which are usually more toxic than carbonaceous dbps moreover sulfur containing compounds were observed in a uv based advanced reduction process arp li et al 2014 meaning that not only aop but also arp can generate undesirable compounds such compounds with unknown toxicities surely deserve more consideration in the future in addition photo cata lysis may alter the biological activity in three ways fig 6b 1 loss of biological activity derived from the parent compound 2 formation of highly bioactive compounds from target compounds with lowly biological activity and 3 generation of potentially regulated and or highly toxic compounds with lower biological activity from the parent compound a good photo cata lysis technology should avoid the latter two directions but improve the first way in the future in addition there are some controversies about the formation and transformation of halogenated species in similar types of photochemical processes for example while some studies reported decomposition of organic halogen compounds in seawater into halides upon sunlight irradiation wong and cheng 2001 liu et al 2017 other studies had documented formation of iodinated organic compounds in seawater via sunlight driven halogenation of dom méndez díaz et al 2014 or even polymerization of unsaturated organic contaminants legrini et al 1993 these results hence trigger debates about whether the rate of decomposition is dominant over that of dbp formation during irradiation process and if no how to avoid it in brief summary there are many inconsistent and incomparable data reported from existing studies which underscores the importance of developing a series of protocols for studying the toxicity of photo cata lysis processes in authors opinion since formation and transformation of redox byproducts always coexist people should provide a more general view of the pollutants treatment process instead of just reporting the degradation levels at a fixed time to allow better evaluation of the benefits and risks of all uv technologies in the future 4 uncertainty in radicals radicals are usually characterized as short lived highly reactive compounds with extremely low steady state concentrations in water e g 10 10 12 10 10 16 m up to date marvelous advances have been made in understanding the formation and occurrence of radicals in uv irradiated waters for example it is already known that pulse radiolysis and laser photolysis of water in the presence of nitrous oxide n2o can yield relatively pure oh flash laser photolysis of s2o8 2 can produce so4 uv photolysis of fm can yield co2 radicals uv irradiation of methanol can create methanol radical gara et al 2007 uv photolysis of alcohols like ethanol 2 propanol or ketones like acetone benzophenone in do rich and alkaline solutions could generate o2 gara et al 2007 and uv photolysis of phenol or p benzoquinone in oxygen free solution could generate eaq gu et al 2017a 2017b of all radicals oh is the most commonly used oxidative radical and eaq is the most known reductive radical of all oh sensitizers or precursors the φ oh at 254 nm uv generally follow the order dom 0 00048 no2 0 083 no3 0 094 h2o2 1 0 peracetic acid 1 2 lester et al 2013 cai et al 2017 the quantum yields of singlet oxygen φ1o2 from dom photolysis suwannee river humic acid and suwannee river fulvic acid ranged from 1 4 to 3 2 which are higher than the φ1o2 from h2o2 photolysis 0 11 0 14 lester et al 2013 the quantum yield of so4 φso4 from peroxymonosulfate pms 0 12 was usually lower than that from peroxodisulfate pds 1 4 at 248 nm by herrmann 2007 or 0 52 at 254 nm by gligorovski et al 2015 making the latter more favored in practice the quantum yield of cl φcl from hypochloric acid hocl 0 25 was higher than that from chloroacetone 0 17 at 248 nm herrmann 2007 as for dom radicals the maximum fluorescence quantum yield of sunlit dom decreased with additions of cl and br meaning that these halides can quench singlet excited state dom 1dom glover and rosario ortiz 2013 in the meantime the concentration of 3dom was increased suggesting a conversion of 1dom into 3dom glover and rosario ortiz 2013 however there are also some uncertainties confusions or even controversial findings from earlier studies here below shows some examples 4 1 uncertain radicals transformation and interconversion while most of earlier studies focused on formation of radicals much less attention has been paid to the importance of radicals transformations and interconversion for example although uv irradiated peroxymonosulfate generated more oh and so4 with increasing ph guan et al 2011 both radicals were subjective to reaction with oh kinetics are shown in table 2 and fig 4c eventually leading to lower treatability in alkaline solution that means the ultimate treatability of a uv process is actually determined by both radicals formation and transformation to allow a comprehensive view of the potential transformations of radicals fig 3 shows the possibilities of interconversions of radicals and reactive species during uv h2o2 uv s2o8 2 or uv cl2 processes in the presence of cl br and hco3 while table 1 table 2 and table 4 put together a list of reactions and reaction k values for some radicals in the presence of a variety of aqueous components the higher the k value is the more radical is likely transformed in addition radicals self termination reactions are often ignored for example the k of oh self recombination was 4 0 109 m 1 s 1 and the k of reaction between oh and so4 was 1 0 109 m 1 s 1 table 4 both are quicker than reactions between oh and dom although in nature dom is greater than oh so that people do not need to concern about oh recombination the radical termination process is sometimes very important when radicals are produced either abundantly e g uv h2o2 or in a limited space where radicals recombination occurs faster than radicals diffusion into solution such as sonolysis hu et al 2008 and tio2 photocatalysis hou et al in addition it was reported that the oh used for degrading p chlorobenzoic acid p cba a typical probe compound was about three orders of magnitude lower than that used for oh recombination during the vuv photolysis zhang et al 2020 meaning that a considerable amount of radicals had been wasted in the self termination processes that means although the steady state concentrations of radicals are usually order of magnitude lower than those of target compounds the amount of radicals used for contaminant degradation or self termination may not necessarily be that low if the wasted radicals are fully utilized they can probably significantly promote the contaminant degradation reactions in terms of reaction pathways it is recognized that both o2 and ho2 recombination can lead to formation of h2o2 gonzalez et al 2004 zhang et al 2020 at different rates as shown below reaction 1 2ho2 h2o2 o2 k1 2 106 m 1 s 1 reaction 2 2o2 2h2o h2o2 o2 2oh k2 3 10 1 m 1 s 1 reaction 3 o2 ho2 h2o h2o2 o2 2oh k3 6 1012 ph m 1 s 1 because the pka of ho2 is 4 8 and it deprotonates in neutral solution o2 is expected to be the dominant species for h2o2 formation in ambient water conditions cooper and zika 1983 however its reaction rate constant was extremely low k1 3 10 1 m 1 s 1 gonzalez et al 2004 somehow disputing the possibility thus the fate transformation and interconversion of radicals in aops and arps really require more elucidation 4 2 uncertain radicals determination identifying and quantifying radicals in water is necessary to help understand photo cata lysis processes rosario ortiz and canonica 2016 due to their short lives and extremely low levels the concentrations of radicals cannot be analyzed by conventional methods such as chromatography spectrophotometry and electrochemical sensor instead many researchers used a series of indirect methods to detect radicals by checking either degradation or formation of specific compound s however users should be aware of the limitations assumptions and application scopes of these methods prior to uses accordingly this review prepares a table table 5 showing the advantages disadvantages and key considerations of each method of all methods electron spin resonance esr electron paramagnetic resonance epr or laser induced fluorescence lif are the most commonly used measures to identify radicals however due to the high equipment cost operational complication and inability of accurately quantifying radicals their uses are often supplemented by other radical detection tools even though esr epr lif techniques can prove the presence of specific radicals it alone cannot justify or confirm if the identified radical plays a dominant role in degrading the pollutant in selected process especially in a process where multiple radicals are present simultaneously in addition esr epr is likely interfered too for instance the technique has failed in providing clear evidence of the relative importance of oh vs ferryl in a fenton reaction because the reaction of oh with a probe intended for esr epr or high performance liquid chromatography analysis gives exactly the same radical intermediate as an one electron abstraction process initiated by water and deprotonation fontmorin et al 2016 the first alternative used for identifying and quantifying radicals is the use of probe compounds pcs such as p cba for oh furfuryl alcohol for 1o2 tetranitromethane for o2 and monochloroacetic acid for eaq rosario ortiz and canonica 2016 which can be defined as molecules that can selectively react with specific target radical s by monitoring the concentration changes of pcs or its reaction product s the steady state concentrations of radicals can be derived from their known k values an ideal probe should be easy to measure stable in selected environment and selective toward individual radical species however this is often difficult to achieve when a non selective reactant such as oh is also present in such condition it is necessary to spike oh scavenging compound simultaneously to suppress the interfering radical furthermore in order not to interfere with existing reactions between radicals and target compounds a key prerequisite of the use of pc is to not overdosing pc however probably for measurement convenience purpose this was not well followed by earlier studies in addition pc is required to not decompose readily under selected uv wavelength while most of compounds used before are uv absorbing table 4 and vulnerable to vuv direct photolysis because of so the influence of direct photolysis may become non negligible and consequently only the kinetics gap can be attributable to radical s contribution in order to minimize bias researchers may develop an optimal pc dose with minimal direct photolysis influence notably it is extremely difficult to gain mechanistic insights by using probe molecules in tio2 photocatalysis study although trapped oh is likely less reactive than free oh and meantime trapped hole is more powerful than oh their relative roles are difficult to differentiate when they coexist since water is easy to form hydroxylated compounds by electron transfer process it is not always possible convenient to translate those techniques that work well in surface water photochemistry into photocatalysis processes for instance the typical 3dom probes for surface waters work only because 3dom oh whereas in aops the probes would behave as almost oh scavengers the second but more common alternative approach for detecting radicals is the use of scavenging compounds scs or quenchers such as tert butanol tba for oh sodium azide for 1o2 superoxide dismutase for o2 and n2o for eaq which are defined as compounds capable of inhibiting reactions between radical s and target compounds this approach assumes that by inhibiting the roles of specific radicals responsible for reaction specifically by monitoring the kinetics changes before and after addition of sc people can conclude that such degradation process is completely or partially attributed to the suppressed radicals this approach is very easy to implement because it does not add any extra analytical loads to existing process therefore it is commonly applied in literature under the principles the reaction between sc and radicals should be strong enough to exert significant reduction of existing pollutant degradation kinetics therefore this approach usually requires dosing an excessive amount of sc however not all studies have checked if the amount of scavenger is sufficient or confirmed whether additional or less scavenger dosage would further inhibit or facilitate the reaction kinetics for example of 56 reviewed haas photolysis studies wang et al 2019 only one study had applied two levels of tba to verify complete quenching of oh wang et al 2017c meanwhile because of the abundance of sc it should be noted that sc is likely to produce other types of reactant e g radicals or products e g fa fm that can either facilitate or hinder existing reaction in addition some scavengers are able to scavenge quench various types of radicals for instance the well known 1o2 quencher n3 is also a very effective oh scavenger gutiérrez et al 1991 therefore the interpretation of experimental data might not always be straightforward and compounding effect should be carefully checked glover and rosario ortiz 2013 marchisio et al 2015 noteworthy the use of methanol for oh quantification falls in between pcs and scs because it does not absorb uv254 people often spike methanol in excess just like the use of a sc and then quantify oh via its reaction products i e fa just like the use of a pc lester et al 2013 cawley et al 2015 in addition because of its low absorptivity at vuv185 methanol was often used as an actinometer for quantification of vuv fluence zoschke et al 2014 however there are some problems for the use of methanol one of the key issues is that irradiation of methanol by uv254 was able to trigger formation of secondary radicals or reactive species such as methanol radical gara et al 2007 which may interfere with the determination of oh another issue in using methanol is that not all oh actually probably just a small portion of oh reacted with methanol to generate formaldehyde lester et al 2013 thus making it unreliable to obtain the steady state concentration of oh moreover the k of reaction between methanol and oh is similar to that between methanol and cl meaning that it is unable to distinguish these two radicals produced simultaneously in uv cl2 process gara et al 2007 so its use as either probe or scavenger requires careful considerations more importantly since multiple radicals are likely present together fig 4 a common problem for using pcs and scs is the lack of consideration of radicals rapid interconversions table 1 for instance during the uv tio2 process addition of formic acid a typical scavenger for oh was capable of converting oh into co2 thereby dehalogenating trichloroacetic acid more rapidly than oh rather than inhibiting the kinetics liu et al 2016a because the presence and role of coexisting radicals are often not disproven at the same time of other radicals confirmation the quantity and role of seemingly important radical s measured by pcs or scs are likely actually a result of rapid transition of other radicals in an exemplary study the importance of selecting appropriate scavengers for radical determination was highlighted han et al 2017 the effects of 20 commonly used scavengers for quantifying five types of radicals were systematically evaluated under varying ph conditions in terms of their light absorbance complexation analytical easiness and potential anti interfering characteristics han et al 2017 only 9 scavengers were finally chosen as suitable scavengers while the uses of inappropriate scavengers would lead to severe overestimations of radicals han et al 2017 sometimes the calculated concentrations of specific radicals appeared inconsistent among methods when a dom was irradiated by uv254 the steady state oh concentration can be estimated by multiple methods which have reached 1 6 10 15 m by using p cba as a pc kp cba oh 5 8 109 m 1 s 1 9 9 10 16 m by using tba as a sc and 4 0 10 18 m by deriving the rate of formaldehyde formation from methanol kmethanol oh 9 7 108 m 1 s 1 lester et al 2013 these huge data gaps among methods apparently suggest equivalent knowledge gaps in our understandings of these processes in summary the uses of esr epr lif pcs and scs for the identification and quantification of radicals need more thoughtful considerations cautions and in depth understandings from a holistic view since many radicals are likely produced upon irradiation their reactions with specific dosed pc and or sc should be thoroughly and carefully evaluated in the future a good strategy for verifying the presence or role of certain radical species to authors opinion is to apply at least two abovementioned approaches as described in table 5 to supplement each other special efforts should be done to detect at least one of fingerprint products to verify not only the presence but also the real impact of specific radical s e g an appearance of a hydroxylated compound with a hydroxyl group oh is clearly indicative of the presence of oh while a substitution of chlorine atom with hydrogen into a compound is a characteristic symbol of cl 4 3 limited h2o2 information compared to other reactive oxygen species h2o2 is relatively more stable yet not well studied by far we know the roles of h2o2 in the environment are double sided on the one hand h2o2 is an important source of oh in the nature cooper and zika 1983 so it is sometimes called as detergent of the environment on the other hand because h2o2 is a product of oh self termination process an advent of h2o2 in water can indicate the presence of oh and or o2 in a photochemical process diesen and jonsson 2014 more importantly earlier study demonstrated that h2o2 is not only widespread in ocean and atmosphere but also in ground water yuan et al 2017 suggesting that a cascade of biogeochemical processes might exert significant impacts on the metal nutrient cycling processes however not many studies have recorded its concentrations in uv based processes even for studies intentionally spiking h2o2 such as fenton and uv h2o2 one key barrier for relatively limited h2o2 measurement in water is probably its unreliable detection methods which mostly rely on color or fluorescence changes caused by reactions between h2o2 and certain reactants song et al 2017 because coexisting oxidants e g oxygen reductants e g dom and colored compounds e g ferric in real water can interfere with the measurement of h2o2 li et al 2012 the accuracy and precision of h2o2 analysis are undermined to reduce interferences earlier researchers often applied air stripping to eliminate coexisting oxidants e g o3 wang et al 2009 before h2o2 measurement or obtained h2o2 by subtracting o3 content from total oxidant concentration lovato et al 2011 apparently these techniques are laborious and highly variable recently one literature report proposed a facile and reaction free method for h2o2 measurement by using ion chromatography ic column to separate h2o2 from other aqueous components followed by detection of h2o2 via a uv detector at 210 nm song et al 2017 because the method is theoretically non interferable by coexisting compounds and is low in mdl 3 0 μg l 1 it might help better understand the formation and transformation of h2o2 in uv driven processes and furthermore through which the roles and formation pathways of many radicals may also be elucidated in addition since the mdl of h2o2 could be further lowered by enlarging injection volume the method can be used to detect trace levels of h2o2 in natural water cooper and zika 1983 serving as a tool to understand the power of nature in transforming anthropogenic pollutants fundamental questions like where h2o2 comes from in the nature and whether photolysis of h2o2 is an important oh source in surface water are still hot topics of interests currently 5 concluding remarks photodegradation of contaminants in water by uv based technologies has been a hot topic of researches for many decades despite of huge advances there are still many material reactor and chemistry issues limiting extensive large scale practical applications of photo cata lysis processes while acknowledging the importance of material and photoreactors this review have summarized three key barriers from a chemistry perspective including the interferences of aqueous components on system performance the formation of undesirable redox products and the uncertainty of radicals identification and quantification to overcome these barriers this study proposes to 1 examine the applicability of photo cata lysis on real samples and compare the performances of emerging and conventional technologies under identical conditions 2 evaluate the benefits and risks of future photo cata lysis technologies from a dynamic panorama rather than snapshots of toxicity changes along the process and explore solutions for controlling the formation of undesirable products and 3 verify the presence and role of dominant radicals responsible for pollutant removal by multiple radical determination methods especially paying attention to the radicals transformation and interconversion and enhance the understanding of h2o2 formation and transformation in different uv processes besides ideas this review prepares some schemes to demonstrate radicals formation and transformation pathways fig 4 and some tables table 2 table 4 to display the rate constant values for the reactions between typical radicals and aqueous components these information can not only help explain photo cata lysis phenomena but also help choose suitable sc and pc in various scenarios for

18041,for decades photolysis and photocatalysis have been touted as promising environment benign and robust technologies to degrade refractory pollutants from water however extensive large scale engineering applications remain limited now to facilitate the technology transfer process earlier reviews have advocated to developing more cost effective and innocuous materials maximizing efficiency of photon usage and optimizing photoreactor systems mostly from material and reactor improvement perspectives however there are also some fundamental yet critical chemistry issues in photo cata lysis processes demanding more in depth understanding and more careful consideration hence this review summarizes some of these challenges of them the first and paramount issue is the interference of coexisting compounds including dissolved organic matter anions cations and spiked additives secondly considerable concerns are pointed to the formation of undesirable reaction by products such as halogenated nitrogenous and sulfur containing compounds which might increase instead of reduce toxicity of water if inadequate fluence and catalyst additive are supplied due to time and cost constraints lastly a critical issue lies in the uncertainty of current approaches used for identifying and quantifying radicals especially when multiple radicals coexist together under changing and interconvertible conditions the review hence highlights the needs to better understand these fundamental chemistry issues and meanwhile calls for more delicate design of experiments in future studies to overcome these barriers keywords photolysis photocatalysis kinetics mechanisms radicals 1 introduction for several decades disinfection of pathogens and treatment of aqueous pollutants by ultraviolet uv based technologies have been of interests to numerous environmental scientists and engineers oppenländer 2003 a number of uv based processes including vacuum uv vuv uv ozone uv o3 uv hydrogen peroxide uv h2o2 uv fenton uv ferrous h2o2 uv titanium uv tio2 uv persulfate uv s2o8 2 uv chlorine uv cl2 and uv sulfite uv so3 2 have been examined in bench pilot and full scale studies miklos et al 2018 depending on the types of lights and the availability of additive and or catalyst uv based technologies can general be classified into three groups 1 light only photolysis e g uv vuv or sunlight which does not employ any additive catalyst to degrade contaminants 2 photooxidation which degrades compounds by adding oxidizing additive catalyst to produce oxidative species like hydroxyl radical oh sulfate radical so4 and chlorine radical cl and 3 photoreduction which removes contaminants by uv induced reductive radicals like hydrated electron eaq hydrogen atom h and superoxide anion radical o2 because of the outstanding performance and operating convenience some uv based advanced oxidation processes aops have been widely accepted in several niche arenas such as producing ultrapure water lee et al 2016 and analyzing aqueous elements scheuer et al 1995 golimowski and golimowska 1996 bendicho et al 2010 embedded in organic compounds e g nitrogen halogen and sulfur and coordinated metals e g cadmium arsenic and nickel for example uv s2o8 2 was often used for analysis of total organic carbon toc yoon et al 2018 medium pressure mercury lamp induced uv mpuv was once employed for detection of total nitrogen tn total phosphorous tp and toc armstrong and tibbitts 1968 mpuv h2o2 was applied for measurement of tn bronk et al 2000 tp and iron henriksen 1970 uv o3 was used for chemical oxygen demand analysis yu et al 2016 and vuv was employed for determination of toc and tn huber et al 2011 more recently some studies used vuv as a pretreatment step to assist detection of total organic halogen tox bu et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 and dissolved organic nitrogen zhu et al 2015 chen et al 2019 hence further expanding the horizons of uv technology in analytical chemistry area however up to date extensive large scale applications of uv based technologies on pollution control in engineering waters e g drinking municipal industrial and swimming pool waters remain limited the abundance of published paper and tested compounds apparently do not alien with the scarcity of photo cata lysis practices the reason of the gap is largely attributed to low light usage efficiency of materials and reactors namely unsatisfying cost effectiveness pichat 2015 ahmad et al 2016 to facilitate the technology transfer process from a technical hype into a real hope some explanations are provided and some strategic countermeasures are advocated loeb et al 2018 for example pichat 2015 pointed out three barriers related to material s low performance including wasted radicals insufficient contact of pollutant with catalyst and low sensitivity of photocatalyst at visible light region to overcome these barriers the measures proposed include reducing the radicals recombination e g by introducing novel catalyst increasing the contact of pollutant with catalyst e g combining tio2 with activated carbon and extending spectral range of catalysts e g by doping n element meanwhile some researches highlighted the importance of catalyst recovery and photoreactor design chong et al 2010 ahmad et al 2016 oriented by these strategies it is expected that numerous studies will be motivated to explore more robust innocuous and economic materials in the future mostly from material and reactor improvement perspectives however there are also some fundamental yet critical chemistry issues commonly encountered in photolysis and photocatalysis processes that demand more thorough understanding and more careful considerations e g the complicated effects of ph on system performance and the mechanisms responsible for radicals formation and inhibition table 1 therefore this review intends to summarize some of chemistry challenges currently limiting photo cata lysis applications although many of them are difficult to solve at current stage we hope to raise a more in depth recognition avoid some misuses and misinterpretations and therefore provoke more novel solutions in the future the general topics of interests are outlined in fig 1 2 interference from coexisting compounds for any aop to be used in real water a common challenge is the impairment of degradation efficiency by coexisting compounds such as dissolved organic matter dom and inorganic ions such impairments may either be caused by screening of uv photon undesired competition between uv or radicals with non targeted compound and or inhibition of radical formation table 1 regardless of reason they could decrease system performance and increase cost eventually making the efficiency less appealing hence a thorough and systematic assessment of the impacts of common aqueous components on the photo cata lysis efficiency is necessary here below shows some examples of contradictory or confusing results reported before 2 1 interferences from organics usually the presence of dom can result in significant inhibition of photochemical processes either by light screening effect or via scavenging of oh generated by photosensitizers using atrazine as a practical example although uv s2o8 2 was more powerful than uv h2o2 in degrading atrazine when it was treated alone uv h2o2 outperformed uv s2o8 2 when a mixture of compounds including atrazine methyl tert butyl ether cis dichloroethane 1 4 dioxane and 1 1 1 trichloroethane were treated together antoniou and andersen 2015 the efficiency discrepancy indicates that the susceptibility of each compound was subject to influences by other coexisting organic compounds meanwhile it illustrates the difficulty in selecting the best system to treat target compound under different conditions earlier studies have reported second order reaction rate constants k for a variety of surface water derived natural organic matter nom and wastewater derived effluent organic matter efom reacting with oh which ranged from 1 39 to 2 18 108 m 1 s 1 for nom isolates westerhoff et al 2007 and 2 0 to 4 0 108 m 1 s 1 for efom keen et al 2014 attesting that both nom and efom could inhibit photo cata lysis significantly by acting as oh scavengers for most of target compounds zhu et al 2007 wu et al 2016 lv et al 2017 however there are also studies reporting considerable production of reactive oxygen species ross such as singlet oxygen 1o2 o2 and h2o2 from nom and efom thomas smith and blough 2001 glover and rosario ortiz 2013 sun et al 2015 rosario ortiz and canonica 2016 which are capable of facilitating compound degradations during irradiation process table 2 the coexistence of ros scavenging and generating effects is apparently inconsistent meaning that the diversity of nom and efom property and quantity may complicate the treatability of uv processes and therefore make their applications unpredictable to broad environmental conditions as for photocatalytic process since photocatalysts are more powerful than nom efom in generating radicals it is difficult for nom efom to bring additional beneficial effects to the system therefore the role of nom efom is usually inhibitive and less desirable for practical applications compared to oh 1 9 2 7 ev so4 2 5 3 1 ev has comparable or even stronger oxidizing capability than oh 1 9 2 7 ev whereas less scavenging effect by dom 7 8 107 m 1 s 1 than oh 2 8 108 m 1 s 1 yang et al 2016 hence justifying the development of so4 relevant techniques for degrading trace organic contaminants overall when multiple contaminants coexist in a water with dom the choice of uv h2o2 or uv s2o8 2 is likely determined not only by their own reaction rates with radicals but also by the relative impacts of dom on the radicals and their influences on each other 2 2 interferences from inorganics inorganic components are another pool of compounds known to be reactive with radicals generated in photochemical processes table 2 summarizes some k values for the reactions between typical radicals and inorganic species for example anions like bicarbonate hco3 carbonate co3 2 chloride cl and bromide br can scavenge oh while anions like hco3 cl sulfate so4 2 and phosphate po4 3 can quench both holes and electrons liao et al 2001 chong et al 2010 their oh quenching ability can generally be ranked as hydroxide oh br nitrite no2 cl co3 2 hco3 under identical concentration levels based on their k values table 2 meanwhile fig 2 shows the influences of cl no3 and co3 2 on the so4 indicating that conversion and inhibition of radicals may occur during the process because of the different reactivities of target compounds radicals and anions guan et al 2018 using 1 4 dioxane carbamazepine phenol 17β estradiol aniline and sulfamethoxazole as examples although the orders of treatability were ordered as uv s2o8 2 which yielded both so4 and oh uv h2o2 which generated oh uv cl2 which produced cl and co2 in simulated effluent water uv s2o8 2 was more likely interfered by ph cl and hco3 than other processes fig 3 however the rates of reactions between anions and radicals indicate that so4 should be theoretically scavenged by hco3 cl and oh more slowly than oh table 2 meaning that uv h2o2 is expected to be more sensitive than uv s2o8 2 in the presence of ph cl and hco3 such differences between theoretical estimations and experimental results thus make uv based technologies more difficult to be practiced under conditions simulative of reused wastewater for anions with different reactivities their relative concentrations are expected to play important roles too yuan et al 2011 guan et al 2018 for example a water containing 1 mm cl in acidic condition k oh is 3 0 109 m 1 s 1 is supposed to be more inhibitory to oh than a water with 10 mm hco3 in neutral condition k oh 1 0 107 m 1 s 1 for degradation of target pollutant figs 2 and 3 however most of earlier studies simply compared them at identical levels and seldom mentioned about their concentration effects in addition only a few studies have examined the influences of cations on photo cata lysis for example potassium has much higher light absorptivity 841 m 1 cm 1 at 185 nm ε 185 than that of sodium 0 01 m 1 cm 1 duca et al 2017 meaning that special care should be taken toward potassium when it is used on vuv process in terms of other cations there was a general census reached from earlier photocatalysis studies that cupric ferrous and aluminum ions at certain levels can reduce mineralization rates whereas calcium magnesium and zinc ions impose little changes chong et al 2010 in order to make it convenient for future studies a list of ε 185 and ε 254 values are summarized in table 2 a study evidenced that metal cations could react with reactive species generated from photolysis of dom wan et al 2019 generally the paramagnetic metal cations trivalent chromium magnesium ferrous and cupric ions exhibited stronger inhibition for reactive species such as triplet excited state dom 3dom 1o2 and oh than other cations e g calcium magnesium aluminum and zinc ions wan et al 2019 of all anions special attention should be paid to nox species because of their double edge effects on the one hand uv irradiation of no2 is able to yield oh with the quantum yield of oh φ oh as 1 5 8 0 at 254 350 nm wavelengths mack and bolton 1999 on the other hand no2 features strong scavenging ability on oh k oh 0 25 1 4 1010 m 1 s 1 and considerable uv absorptivity at 254 nm ε 254 13 0 m 1 cm 1 table 2 meaning that the presence of no2 is more likely to inhibit rather than facilitate oh formation to degrade target pollutant fig 2 in contrast although the φ oh of nitrate no3 is similar to no2 being 1 3 9 0 at 254 300 nm wavelengths the ε 254 of no3 3 5 m 1 cm 1 table 2 was much lower than that of no2 and its reaction rate with oh was almost negligible k oh 1 105 m 1 s 1 hence although no3 yields similar amount of oh as no2 no3 screens less photons and consumes less oh than no2 eventually making more oh available for pollutant control than no2 even so a review once stated that neither no2 nor no3 could generate as much oh as h2o2 φ oh 100 mack and bolton 1999 and therefore their potentials in generating oh should not be overstated meanwhile although nitrite is considerably more photoactive than nitrate nitrate is usually more concentrated than nitrite in solution thus compensating it low reactivity notably there are numerous exceptions and unpredictable results documented in previous uv based processes for example the presence of cl might eventually enhance instead of inhibit the removal of target pollutant yuan et al 2011 because the pollutant preferred to react with specific radical e g cl formed by oh in acidic solution reactions 29 30 and 32 in table 1 in another example the inhibitory effects of cl and hco3 on oh were shown to be minor even at very high concentration levels 250 mm liao et al 2001 which apparently disagree with earlier theoretical derivations the lack of inhibition effect from hco3 might due to the formation of carbonate radical co3 from reaction between oh and hco3 although the reactivity of oh is much higher than that of co3 the steady state concentration of co3 is likely higher than that of oh thus compensating for its lower reactivity sánchez polo et al 2013 moreover co3 might be more selective to dom thereby suffering less than oh from the scavenging effect and ultimately enhancing the degradation wu and linden 2010 liu et al 2016b interestingly earlier studies have demonstrated formation of not only oxidative radicals e g cl so4 and oh herrmann 2007 but also reductive radicals e g eaq from uv vuv irradiation of the same anions sauer et al 2004 these contrasting effects require further clarification too in the future 2 3 impacts from additives solution ph and the type and dose of additives are often important operational factors affecting chemical reactions although it is usually difficult to control and adjust ph for treating large amount of water in real practice people investigated it often for sake of better understanding in one exemplary study researchers compared the treatabilities of uv monochloramine nh2cl and uv cl2 for abatement of several wastewater derived compounds i e benzoate carbamazepine and 1 4 dioxane chuang et al 2017 although the results showed that uv cl2 performed better than uv nh2cl at ambient condition the later was ultimately favored because its performance was independent of ph whereas the performance of uv cl2 decreased markedly from ph of 5 5 8 3 the decreased efficiency in uv cl2 at elevated ph was largely attributed to a conversion of cl into oh which was not favored for the selected compounds chuang et al 2017 another study reported similar phenomenon in which cl formed by uv cl2 was more powerful than oh formed by uv h2o2 at ph of 7 0 8 0 but became less capable than oh at ph of 6 0 yin et al 2018 confirming that the relative robustness of cl and oh are highly reliant upon solution ph fig 4 d although some compounds could actually become easier to oxidize at higher ph e g phenols phenolates babuponnusami and muthukumar 2012 the general decreasing trend of redox potentials for ross with elevating ph certainly accompany with decreasing photodegradation ability fig 5 besides the types of additive the dosing amount and dosing mode of additive also add up complexity of reactor operation for example although uv cl2 was shown to be more efficient than uv h2o2 in degrading nitrobenzene at oxidant levels of 0 05 0 06 mm the trend reversed when the oxidants were dosed at 0 15 mm level watts et al 2007 in another study a small amount of h2o2 was added intermittently for multiple times instead of dosing a large amount of h2o2 once at the beginning to enable more efficient oxidation of ammonia by oh wang et al 2017a compared to dosing once such operation may add difficulty to implement it in practice in theory the rate constant of reaction between h2o2 and oh is rapid 2 7 107 m 1s 1 zhang et al 2020 meaning that an excessive amount of h2o2 could scavenge oh in the meantime of producing it and therefore be detrimental to the overall degradation performance goldstein et al 2007 in addition one single compound may trigger formation of multiple radicals with different properties fig 4 for example formic acid fm it can yield either strong oxidative radical oh upon irradiation by uv wang and bai 2016 or strong reductive radical co2 upon exposure to uv s2o8 2 gu et al 2017c although the formation of reductive species might somehow be explained by hydrogen h atom abstraction of formate from organic radicals i e hcoo r co2 rh it is hard to understand why adding a strong oxidant s2o8 2 into a uv system would facilitate formation of reductive species like co2 in brief summary earlier studies mostly demonstrated the promising sides of proposed photo cata lysis technologies but seldom examined the harmful effects of coexisting compounds on the performance of selected systems while many individual studies have pioneering demonstrated the diversity and robustness of many photo cata lysis systems a bigger and whole picture should be made to cover not only promising but also unsatisfying sides in the future it would be necessary to apply a list of interfering compounds in water to verify the photo cata lysis ability in more realistic conditions particularly we agree with an earlier proposal von gunten 2018 that it is important to compare emerging technologies with established benchmark technologies e g ozone and uv h2o2 in terms of energy demands economics and the possibilities of integration into existing water treatment systems in theory it is also crucial to have an in depth investigation of the interfering mechanisms imposed by different types of compounds 3 formation of undesirable byproducts in addition to degradation efficiency issues another major barrier hindering the acceptance of uv driven technologies is their potential formation of undesirable compounds von gunten 2018 since most of uv processes cannot completely mineralize contaminants mostly due to energy and cost constraints their photogenerated intermediates and end products inevitably arouse concerns zare afifi and blatchley 2016 especially when the process is followed by other treatment processes in this review we present some examples of studies table 3 to help support the opinions as shown below rather than summarize all evidences reported before because many of them are already reviewed in two recent articles ike et al 2019a 2019b according to the application modes of photolysis and redox practices we classify earlier studies into two categories one uses uv process as a pretreatment approach prior to redox process e g chlorination or chloramination namely sequential uv redox process and the other uses uv and redox compound e g disinfectant sulfite together and simultaneously namely simultaneous uv redox process 3 1 sequential uv redox processes for all uv processes the common side effect of uv irradiation is formation of relatively smaller molecular weight mw compounds like ketones aldehydes and carboxylic acids which can serve as precursors of halogenated disinfection byproducts dbps in ensuing chlor am ination processes the types of lights evaluated before include uv mpuv pulsed uv vuv and sunlight while the additives examined already focus on the uses of h2o2 and tio2 the precursors tested before cover from model compounds like resorcinol to typical nom isolates purchased from international humic substances society and sometimes even real water samples the types of dbps studied mostly aim to regulated species such as trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas but relatively less to emerging dbps like nitrosodimethylamine and haloacetonitriles hans table 3 in general the amount of dbps and corresponding toxicities of water increased at low uv dosage conditions i e early reaction period but decreased with further increases of uv dose meaning that there is a possibility of exacerbating water quality along the reaction especially in conditions with insufficient uv dosage in terms of dbps formation trends earlier results vary greatly among studies depending on many operational and environmental factors for example while one study reported less formation of dbps with the use of uv pretreatment zare afifi and blatchley 2016 another study documented elevated dbps formation with the same type of uv lamp cheema et al 2017 meanwhile although uv h2o2 pretreatment decreased the haas formation potentials fps of resorcinol in following chlorination process it increased the haas fps slightly for serine and dramatically for leucine sakai et al 2013 an indicator of the importance of precursor type for a fixed precursor the effects of uv on dbps fps might govern the species of formed dbps in one exemplary study pretreatment of nom via mpuv tio2 h2o2 had led to lower thms fps but remained unchanged for haas fps liu et al 2008 in another pilot scale study both thms and haas fps were promoted with the use of uv h2o2 pretreatment metz et al 2011 serving as an excellent evidence of the negative sides of poor managed uv pretreatment the abovementioned inconsistencies are likely caused by variations of organic type quantity and water characteristics on the dbp formation on the one hand uv based methods could transform high mw hydrophobic compounds into small mw hydrophilic and assimilable compounds liu et al 2002 2008 thus raising the concerns of biological safety of distribution system and formation of secondary byproducts on the other hand insufficient contact time and additive application could result in minor reduction liu et al 2002 or even elevated formation of dbps chen et al 2011 therefore a challenge for future study is perhaps to determine the threshold or boundary separating sufficiency and insufficiency of light and additive dosage 3 2 simultaneous uv redox processes within this category uv cl2 process is a special concern although it is an attractive approach for treating numerous micropollutants recently fang et al 2014 due to its operational simplicity and comparable treatability as uv h2o2 wang et al 2015 the reason mainly comes from its potential formation of toxic assimilable and sensory unpleasant products by cl wang et al 2018 fig 6 for example when uv254 was used to reduce iodate into iodide hypoiodous acid was likely formed and then reacted with nom to form iodinated dbps tian et al 2017 in addition bromide and iodide may be oxidized directly by oh to bromate iodate and bromine iodine and then the latter enable formation of brominated and iodinated dbps von gunten 2003 for this reason uv h2o2 was preferred over uv s2o8 2 for samples containing br because so4 was more powerful than oh in transforming br into bromate and bromine and therefore form more brominated byproducts wang et al 2017b notably uv technologies may also lead to formation of nitrogenous dbps wang et al 2015 cheema et al 2017 which are usually more toxic than carbonaceous dbps moreover sulfur containing compounds were observed in a uv based advanced reduction process arp li et al 2014 meaning that not only aop but also arp can generate undesirable compounds such compounds with unknown toxicities surely deserve more consideration in the future in addition photo cata lysis may alter the biological activity in three ways fig 6b 1 loss of biological activity derived from the parent compound 2 formation of highly bioactive compounds from target compounds with lowly biological activity and 3 generation of potentially regulated and or highly toxic compounds with lower biological activity from the parent compound a good photo cata lysis technology should avoid the latter two directions but improve the first way in the future in addition there are some controversies about the formation and transformation of halogenated species in similar types of photochemical processes for example while some studies reported decomposition of organic halogen compounds in seawater into halides upon sunlight irradiation wong and cheng 2001 liu et al 2017 other studies had documented formation of iodinated organic compounds in seawater via sunlight driven halogenation of dom méndez díaz et al 2014 or even polymerization of unsaturated organic contaminants legrini et al 1993 these results hence trigger debates about whether the rate of decomposition is dominant over that of dbp formation during irradiation process and if no how to avoid it in brief summary there are many inconsistent and incomparable data reported from existing studies which underscores the importance of developing a series of protocols for studying the toxicity of photo cata lysis processes in authors opinion since formation and transformation of redox byproducts always coexist people should provide a more general view of the pollutants treatment process instead of just reporting the degradation levels at a fixed time to allow better evaluation of the benefits and risks of all uv technologies in the future 4 uncertainty in radicals radicals are usually characterized as short lived highly reactive compounds with extremely low steady state concentrations in water e g 10 10 12 10 10 16 m up to date marvelous advances have been made in understanding the formation and occurrence of radicals in uv irradiated waters for example it is already known that pulse radiolysis and laser photolysis of water in the presence of nitrous oxide n2o can yield relatively pure oh flash laser photolysis of s2o8 2 can produce so4 uv photolysis of fm can yield co2 radicals uv irradiation of methanol can create methanol radical gara et al 2007 uv photolysis of alcohols like ethanol 2 propanol or ketones like acetone benzophenone in do rich and alkaline solutions could generate o2 gara et al 2007 and uv photolysis of phenol or p benzoquinone in oxygen free solution could generate eaq gu et al 2017a 2017b of all radicals oh is the most commonly used oxidative radical and eaq is the most known reductive radical of all oh sensitizers or precursors the φ oh at 254 nm uv generally follow the order dom 0 00048 no2 0 083 no3 0 094 h2o2 1 0 peracetic acid 1 2 lester et al 2013 cai et al 2017 the quantum yields of singlet oxygen φ1o2 from dom photolysis suwannee river humic acid and suwannee river fulvic acid ranged from 1 4 to 3 2 which are higher than the φ1o2 from h2o2 photolysis 0 11 0 14 lester et al 2013 the quantum yield of so4 φso4 from peroxymonosulfate pms 0 12 was usually lower than that from peroxodisulfate pds 1 4 at 248 nm by herrmann 2007 or 0 52 at 254 nm by gligorovski et al 2015 making the latter more favored in practice the quantum yield of cl φcl from hypochloric acid hocl 0 25 was higher than that from chloroacetone 0 17 at 248 nm herrmann 2007 as for dom radicals the maximum fluorescence quantum yield of sunlit dom decreased with additions of cl and br meaning that these halides can quench singlet excited state dom 1dom glover and rosario ortiz 2013 in the meantime the concentration of 3dom was increased suggesting a conversion of 1dom into 3dom glover and rosario ortiz 2013 however there are also some uncertainties confusions or even controversial findings from earlier studies here below shows some examples 4 1 uncertain radicals transformation and interconversion while most of earlier studies focused on formation of radicals much less attention has been paid to the importance of radicals transformations and interconversion for example although uv irradiated peroxymonosulfate generated more oh and so4 with increasing ph guan et al 2011 both radicals were subjective to reaction with oh kinetics are shown in table 2 and fig 4c eventually leading to lower treatability in alkaline solution that means the ultimate treatability of a uv process is actually determined by both radicals formation and transformation to allow a comprehensive view of the potential transformations of radicals fig 3 shows the possibilities of interconversions of radicals and reactive species during uv h2o2 uv s2o8 2 or uv cl2 processes in the presence of cl br and hco3 while table 1 table 2 and table 4 put together a list of reactions and reaction k values for some radicals in the presence of a variety of aqueous components the higher the k value is the more radical is likely transformed in addition radicals self termination reactions are often ignored for example the k of oh self recombination was 4 0 109 m 1 s 1 and the k of reaction between oh and so4 was 1 0 109 m 1 s 1 table 4 both are quicker than reactions between oh and dom although in nature dom is greater than oh so that people do not need to concern about oh recombination the radical termination process is sometimes very important when radicals are produced either abundantly e g uv h2o2 or in a limited space where radicals recombination occurs faster than radicals diffusion into solution such as sonolysis hu et al 2008 and tio2 photocatalysis hou et al in addition it was reported that the oh used for degrading p chlorobenzoic acid p cba a typical probe compound was about three orders of magnitude lower than that used for oh recombination during the vuv photolysis zhang et al 2020 meaning that a considerable amount of radicals had been wasted in the self termination processes that means although the steady state concentrations of radicals are usually order of magnitude lower than those of target compounds the amount of radicals used for contaminant degradation or self termination may not necessarily be that low if the wasted radicals are fully utilized they can probably significantly promote the contaminant degradation reactions in terms of reaction pathways it is recognized that both o2 and ho2 recombination can lead to formation of h2o2 gonzalez et al 2004 zhang et al 2020 at different rates as shown below reaction 1 2ho2 h2o2 o2 k1 2 106 m 1 s 1 reaction 2 2o2 2h2o h2o2 o2 2oh k2 3 10 1 m 1 s 1 reaction 3 o2 ho2 h2o h2o2 o2 2oh k3 6 1012 ph m 1 s 1 because the pka of ho2 is 4 8 and it deprotonates in neutral solution o2 is expected to be the dominant species for h2o2 formation in ambient water conditions cooper and zika 1983 however its reaction rate constant was extremely low k1 3 10 1 m 1 s 1 gonzalez et al 2004 somehow disputing the possibility thus the fate transformation and interconversion of radicals in aops and arps really require more elucidation 4 2 uncertain radicals determination identifying and quantifying radicals in water is necessary to help understand photo cata lysis processes rosario ortiz and canonica 2016 due to their short lives and extremely low levels the concentrations of radicals cannot be analyzed by conventional methods such as chromatography spectrophotometry and electrochemical sensor instead many researchers used a series of indirect methods to detect radicals by checking either degradation or formation of specific compound s however users should be aware of the limitations assumptions and application scopes of these methods prior to uses accordingly this review prepares a table table 5 showing the advantages disadvantages and key considerations of each method of all methods electron spin resonance esr electron paramagnetic resonance epr or laser induced fluorescence lif are the most commonly used measures to identify radicals however due to the high equipment cost operational complication and inability of accurately quantifying radicals their uses are often supplemented by other radical detection tools even though esr epr lif techniques can prove the presence of specific radicals it alone cannot justify or confirm if the identified radical plays a dominant role in degrading the pollutant in selected process especially in a process where multiple radicals are present simultaneously in addition esr epr is likely interfered too for instance the technique has failed in providing clear evidence of the relative importance of oh vs ferryl in a fenton reaction because the reaction of oh with a probe intended for esr epr or high performance liquid chromatography analysis gives exactly the same radical intermediate as an one electron abstraction process initiated by water and deprotonation fontmorin et al 2016 the first alternative used for identifying and quantifying radicals is the use of probe compounds pcs such as p cba for oh furfuryl alcohol for 1o2 tetranitromethane for o2 and monochloroacetic acid for eaq rosario ortiz and canonica 2016 which can be defined as molecules that can selectively react with specific target radical s by monitoring the concentration changes of pcs or its reaction product s the steady state concentrations of radicals can be derived from their known k values an ideal probe should be easy to measure stable in selected environment and selective toward individual radical species however this is often difficult to achieve when a non selective reactant such as oh is also present in such condition it is necessary to spike oh scavenging compound simultaneously to suppress the interfering radical furthermore in order not to interfere with existing reactions between radicals and target compounds a key prerequisite of the use of pc is to not overdosing pc however probably for measurement convenience purpose this was not well followed by earlier studies in addition pc is required to not decompose readily under selected uv wavelength while most of compounds used before are uv absorbing table 4 and vulnerable to vuv direct photolysis because of so the influence of direct photolysis may become non negligible and consequently only the kinetics gap can be attributable to radical s contribution in order to minimize bias researchers may develop an optimal pc dose with minimal direct photolysis influence notably it is extremely difficult to gain mechanistic insights by using probe molecules in tio2 photocatalysis study although trapped oh is likely less reactive than free oh and meantime trapped hole is more powerful than oh their relative roles are difficult to differentiate when they coexist since water is easy to form hydroxylated compounds by electron transfer process it is not always possible convenient to translate those techniques that work well in surface water photochemistry into photocatalysis processes for instance the typical 3dom probes for surface waters work only because 3dom oh whereas in aops the probes would behave as almost oh scavengers the second but more common alternative approach for detecting radicals is the use of scavenging compounds scs or quenchers such as tert butanol tba for oh sodium azide for 1o2 superoxide dismutase for o2 and n2o for eaq which are defined as compounds capable of inhibiting reactions between radical s and target compounds this approach assumes that by inhibiting the roles of specific radicals responsible for reaction specifically by monitoring the kinetics changes before and after addition of sc people can conclude that such degradation process is completely or partially attributed to the suppressed radicals this approach is very easy to implement because it does not add any extra analytical loads to existing process therefore it is commonly applied in literature under the principles the reaction between sc and radicals should be strong enough to exert significant reduction of existing pollutant degradation kinetics therefore this approach usually requires dosing an excessive amount of sc however not all studies have checked if the amount of scavenger is sufficient or confirmed whether additional or less scavenger dosage would further inhibit or facilitate the reaction kinetics for example of 56 reviewed haas photolysis studies wang et al 2019 only one study had applied two levels of tba to verify complete quenching of oh wang et al 2017c meanwhile because of the abundance of sc it should be noted that sc is likely to produce other types of reactant e g radicals or products e g fa fm that can either facilitate or hinder existing reaction in addition some scavengers are able to scavenge quench various types of radicals for instance the well known 1o2 quencher n3 is also a very effective oh scavenger gutiérrez et al 1991 therefore the interpretation of experimental data might not always be straightforward and compounding effect should be carefully checked glover and rosario ortiz 2013 marchisio et al 2015 noteworthy the use of methanol for oh quantification falls in between pcs and scs because it does not absorb uv254 people often spike methanol in excess just like the use of a sc and then quantify oh via its reaction products i e fa just like the use of a pc lester et al 2013 cawley et al 2015 in addition because of its low absorptivity at vuv185 methanol was often used as an actinometer for quantification of vuv fluence zoschke et al 2014 however there are some problems for the use of methanol one of the key issues is that irradiation of methanol by uv254 was able to trigger formation of secondary radicals or reactive species such as methanol radical gara et al 2007 which may interfere with the determination of oh another issue in using methanol is that not all oh actually probably just a small portion of oh reacted with methanol to generate formaldehyde lester et al 2013 thus making it unreliable to obtain the steady state concentration of oh moreover the k of reaction between methanol and oh is similar to that between methanol and cl meaning that it is unable to distinguish these two radicals produced simultaneously in uv cl2 process gara et al 2007 so its use as either probe or scavenger requires careful considerations more importantly since multiple radicals are likely present together fig 4 a common problem for using pcs and scs is the lack of consideration of radicals rapid interconversions table 1 for instance during the uv tio2 process addition of formic acid a typical scavenger for oh was capable of converting oh into co2 thereby dehalogenating trichloroacetic acid more rapidly than oh rather than inhibiting the kinetics liu et al 2016a because the presence and role of coexisting radicals are often not disproven at the same time of other radicals confirmation the quantity and role of seemingly important radical s measured by pcs or scs are likely actually a result of rapid transition of other radicals in an exemplary study the importance of selecting appropriate scavengers for radical determination was highlighted han et al 2017 the effects of 20 commonly used scavengers for quantifying five types of radicals were systematically evaluated under varying ph conditions in terms of their light absorbance complexation analytical easiness and potential anti interfering characteristics han et al 2017 only 9 scavengers were finally chosen as suitable scavengers while the uses of inappropriate scavengers would lead to severe overestimations of radicals han et al 2017 sometimes the calculated concentrations of specific radicals appeared inconsistent among methods when a dom was irradiated by uv254 the steady state oh concentration can be estimated by multiple methods which have reached 1 6 10 15 m by using p cba as a pc kp cba oh 5 8 109 m 1 s 1 9 9 10 16 m by using tba as a sc and 4 0 10 18 m by deriving the rate of formaldehyde formation from methanol kmethanol oh 9 7 108 m 1 s 1 lester et al 2013 these huge data gaps among methods apparently suggest equivalent knowledge gaps in our understandings of these processes in summary the uses of esr epr lif pcs and scs for the identification and quantification of radicals need more thoughtful considerations cautions and in depth understandings from a holistic view since many radicals are likely produced upon irradiation their reactions with specific dosed pc and or sc should be thoroughly and carefully evaluated in the future a good strategy for verifying the presence or role of certain radical species to authors opinion is to apply at least two abovementioned approaches as described in table 5 to supplement each other special efforts should be done to detect at least one of fingerprint products to verify not only the presence but also the real impact of specific radical s e g an appearance of a hydroxylated compound with a hydroxyl group oh is clearly indicative of the presence of oh while a substitution of chlorine atom with hydrogen into a compound is a characteristic symbol of cl 4 3 limited h2o2 information compared to other reactive oxygen species h2o2 is relatively more stable yet not well studied by far we know the roles of h2o2 in the environment are double sided on the one hand h2o2 is an important source of oh in the nature cooper and zika 1983 so it is sometimes called as detergent of the environment on the other hand because h2o2 is a product of oh self termination process an advent of h2o2 in water can indicate the presence of oh and or o2 in a photochemical process diesen and jonsson 2014 more importantly earlier study demonstrated that h2o2 is not only widespread in ocean and atmosphere but also in ground water yuan et al 2017 suggesting that a cascade of biogeochemical processes might exert significant impacts on the metal nutrient cycling processes however not many studies have recorded its concentrations in uv based processes even for studies intentionally spiking h2o2 such as fenton and uv h2o2 one key barrier for relatively limited h2o2 measurement in water is probably its unreliable detection methods which mostly rely on color or fluorescence changes caused by reactions between h2o2 and certain reactants song et al 2017 because coexisting oxidants e g oxygen reductants e g dom and colored compounds e g ferric in real water can interfere with the measurement of h2o2 li et al 2012 the accuracy and precision of h2o2 analysis are undermined to reduce interferences earlier researchers often applied air stripping to eliminate coexisting oxidants e g o3 wang et al 2009 before h2o2 measurement or obtained h2o2 by subtracting o3 content from total oxidant concentration lovato et al 2011 apparently these techniques are laborious and highly variable recently one literature report proposed a facile and reaction free method for h2o2 measurement by using ion chromatography ic column to separate h2o2 from other aqueous components followed by detection of h2o2 via a uv detector at 210 nm song et al 2017 because the method is theoretically non interferable by coexisting compounds and is low in mdl 3 0 μg l 1 it might help better understand the formation and transformation of h2o2 in uv driven processes and furthermore through which the roles and formation pathways of many radicals may also be elucidated in addition since the mdl of h2o2 could be further lowered by enlarging injection volume the method can be used to detect trace levels of h2o2 in natural water cooper and zika 1983 serving as a tool to understand the power of nature in transforming anthropogenic pollutants fundamental questions like where h2o2 comes from in the nature and whether photolysis of h2o2 is an important oh source in surface water are still hot topics of interests currently 5 concluding remarks photodegradation of contaminants in water by uv based technologies has been a hot topic of researches for many decades despite of huge advances there are still many material reactor and chemistry issues limiting extensive large scale practical applications of photo cata lysis processes while acknowledging the importance of material and photoreactors this review have summarized three key barriers from a chemistry perspective including the interferences of aqueous components on system performance the formation of undesirable redox products and the uncertainty of radicals identification and quantification to overcome these barriers this study proposes to 1 examine the applicability of photo cata lysis on real samples and compare the performances of emerging and conventional technologies under identical conditions 2 evaluate the benefits and risks of future photo cata lysis technologies from a dynamic panorama rather than snapshots of toxicity changes along the process and explore solutions for controlling the formation of undesirable products and 3 verify the presence and role of dominant radicals responsible for pollutant removal by multiple radical determination methods especially paying attention to the radicals transformation and interconversion and enhance the understanding of h2o2 formation and transformation in different uv processes besides ideas this review prepares some schemes to demonstrate radicals formation and transformation pathways fig 4 and some tables table 2 table 4 to display the rate constant values for the reactions between typical radicals and aqueous components these information can not only help explain photo cata lysis phenomena but also help choose suitable sc and pc in various scenarios for

18042,the optimal automatic start up of anaerobic digesters has remained an elusive problem over the years to be solved at the lowest possible costs including that of process monitoring in this work a non linear model predictive control nmpc system was developed under two proposed configurations for the optimal start up of anaerobic digesters treating soluble non recalcitrant substrates the minimum set of low cost practical control variables cvs selected for process start up include i the effluent quality as acetate cod ii the level of aceticlastic methanogenic biomass in the reactor and iii the methane production rate only for one of the nmpc configurations the manipulated variables mvs consist of the volumetric inflow rates of the organic substrate dilution water and of a possible concentrated alkali addition to be able to apply the above selected cvs technically and economically feasible to measure estimate a simplified tailored ad model was specifically designed as the prediction model integral part of the nmpc system the nmpc system developed was evaluated for a case scenario consisting of the automatic start up of a high rate ad reactor treating a readily biodegradable carbohydrate based substrate the ad plant was virtually represented by the complex anaerobic digestion model no 1 compared to other manual start up strategies the two configurations of the nmpc developed appeared to reach the target methane production rate faster 39 and 18 days for the nmpc versus 70 75 days for the manual strategies together with an overall superior cv set point tracking error performance interestingly the two configurations of the nmpc developed appear to propose two very different almost opposite start up feeding strategies to both eventually start up the reactor successfully with no process destabilizations throughout a number of practical scenarios were also considered to evaluate the nmpc configurations for robustness and any possible improvements these tests indicate that the nmpc objective function formulation is a key factor of the success and robustness exhibited during start up graphical abstract image 1 keywords anaerobic digestion

subscript k sampling time instant lb lower bound superscript sp set point 1 introduction anaerobic digestion ad is a mature efficient and renewable biotechnology for organic waste removal stabilization and or energy recovery that has been successfully and widely implemented for treatment of a variety of substrates ad is a biological process in which organic matter is degraded in absence of oxygen to generate methane and co2 biogas as the major end products however ad involves a complex network of interactions between different groups of micro organisms that need specific conditions to survive and remain active since they are sensitive to changes in process conditions for any given ad system start up can be a crucial phase as it can determine the entire progression of the system and an ineffective start up can lead to inefficient process onsets e g sub optimal or unstable performance in terms of organic matter removal and biogas production practically ad start up is one of the major operational obstacles owing to the slow growth rate of the key ad microorganisms particularly methanogens and the adaptation requirements of the micro organisms towards the new conditions owing to these limitations and in absence of a well adapted inoculum ad systems could require long times to start up 2 8 months before reaching full performance capacity de lemos chernicharo 2007 lier et al 2008 puñal et al 2000 for ad systems the reduction of start up times is an important factor to increase efficiency and technical competitiveness de lemos chernicharo 2007 and to minimize costs holubar et al 2003 an efficient operational control and optimisation during ad process start up can be beneficial and economical in safely driving the system towards an optimal operation sbarciog and vande wouwer 2014 a number of factors affect the ad start up phase such as feed characteristics type composition and concentration seed sludge or inoculum characteristics quality microbial community profile and relative proportion of micro organisms with respect to each other feed loading rates hydraulic retention time hrt and solids retention time srt goberna et al 2015 janke et al 2016 pandey et al 2011 vadlani and ramachandran 2008 several experimental studies focusing on operational aspects ranging from lab scale to full scale systems testing exist in literature that have focused on one or more of these factors to propose strategies for effective and or rapid start up of ad systems alvarado lassman et al 2010 angelidaki et al 2006 angenent et al 2002 borzacconi et al 2006 dong et al 2010 fdéz güelfo et al 2010 goux et al 2016 janke et al 2016 lagerkvist et al 2015 liang et al 2017 lloret et al 2013 meng et al 2014 pandey et al 2011 puñal et al 2000 vadlani and ramachandran 2008 williams et al 2013 based on these studies the ad start up phase has been typically considered complete after achievement of one or more of the following design organic loading rates olr stable and non inhibitory levels of volatile fatty acids vfas and or ph adequate substrate removal efficiencies stable biogas production in terms of flow methane content and or composition in terms of operational strategy feeding regime e g olr and nutrients supply and inoculation procedures e g inoculum availability characteristics and amount have been major factors affecting the ad performance during start up according to the existing experimental studies on ad start up careful feeding regime is critical during ad start up to allow the sensitive micro organisms to adapt to the different or changing environments and also to avoid any destabilizations in case of feed overloads and or acidification inside the reactor as such it is commonly observed across the existing studies that the ad systems are started up after carrying out any necessary inoculation procedures by feeding in a gradual manner i e the olr is low initially and then gradually increased according to the status of the digester e g vfa levels ph and biogas production although the results have been successful such manual operational feeding strategies provide no assurance of optimality and are likely suboptimal fearing the ad process destabilization some plant operators reject valuable feed during start up phase holubar et al 2003 also according to some technical reports and guides on biogas plant monitoring and operation starting up with significantly low organic loads is not advised since it can lower ad plant productivity and negatively impact microbial growth due to lack of adequate food supply drosg 2013 esteves et al 2012 these limitations indicate that better and optimal operational start up management strategies are still needed for start up with this regard efficient and robust control design becomes essential few studies exist in the literature that have focused on control schemes for ad during start up or restart up amongst these studies summarized in table 1 implementation of model based control strategies for ad start up has shown to be effective and promising aiming for optimal operation during ad start up can help in increasing the practical feasibility of ad technology at large scale for such scenario implementation of optimal control strategies process control while aiming for optimal process performance is highly attractive an example of such strategy is the model predictive control mpc where model predictions and latest measurements are used to determine the set of control input or manipulated variable mv changes that can optimally drive the control outputs or variables cvs to their desired targets set points seborg et al 2011 a characteristic feature of mpc contributing to its success is the consideration of constraints while carrying out the control optimisations grüne and pannek 2011 very few studies exist in literature on mpc implementation for ad systems gaida et al 2012 2011 haugen et al 2014 kil et al 2017 mauky et al 2016 ordace et al 2012 xue et al 2015 but mpc studies particularly focusing on ad start up have not been found nevertheless these studies have shown the effectiveness of mpc strategy for controlling ad systems and its flexibility in implementing different control designs and scenarios a critical factor in the success of model based controllers including mpc is the availability of an accurate and reliable model moreover since such controllers require execution of models with minimum computational intensity models that can give reliable predictions of the complex ad process while having minimal structural complexities are needed on the other hand for virtual testing scenarios prior to experimental testing using reliably structured and complex ad models as virtual plants is necessary for accurate representation of the process plant behaviour with accurate virtual plant models the proposed control schemes can be justly evaluated and assessed on the practical side effective and sufficient monitoring procedures are important for successful operation of an ad process however the few number of variables monitored on line in commercial scale ad systems presents a limitation on the development of effective control strategies where the number and type of variables monitored on line to effectively assess the status of an ad process are a critical component equipment availability skilled personnel availability monitoring costs and difference in opinions of technical consultants are the major factors affecting the extent of monitoring e g number of variables measured and frequency implemented in real life ad plants drosg 2013 however when looking at monitoring costs one should also evaluate the economic losses resulting from insufficient monitoring drosg 2013 in case of achieving an effective ad start up monitoring efforts should be particularly highest since this is a very sensitive phase drosg 2013 considering the start up challenges and limited progress in designing controllers for effective ad start up management a nonlinear model predictive control nmpc scheme is developed in this work for automatic optimal start up of an anaerobic digestion ad system the control scheme is proposed with its practical implementation in mind based on the use of feasible to measure process variables and a specifically designed ad simple prediction model for the nmpc optimisations the nmpc system was implemented under two different configurations and evaluated against an ad case scenario 2 materials and methods 2 1 adm1 based virtual ad plant for nmpc evaluation the comprehensive and widely accepted adm1 by batstone et al 2002 was selected for the most possible accurate in silico representation of the real ad process plant against which the control scheme is being designed and evaluated adm1 is a highly complex model capable of describing the ad process dynamics to great detail it is however a large model requiring large amounts of input information in terms of parameters and influent characteristics as well as being computationally demanding these two reasons make adm1 computationally unfeasible as the prediction model for the nmpc system developed here a virtual ad plant based on the adm1 was implemented to evaluate the performance of the nmpc system developed in this work an empirical correlation not originally included in the adm1 between solids retention time srt with the liquid upflow velocity v up relevant for high rate ad systems was incorporated in the virtual plant model adm1 as well as in the nmpc prediction model sadm based on the solids retention formulations of fedorovich et al 2003 2 2 ad process monitoring during automatic operation the sets of measurements typically available in ad process monitoring are rarely sufficient to fully evaluate and assess the state of the process jimenez et al 2015 although a variety of variables are monitored in commercial scale ad plants the number of variables typically measured online is quite limited ph temperature biogas flow rate biogas composition and partial pressures while a majority are measured off line and less frequently incurring in gaps and information delays however as a result of recent research advanced and novel sensors have been developed for online monitoring of key variables jimenez et al 2015 a number of studies have successfully developed online measurement tools for vfa levels alkalinities partial and total cod and volatile suspended solids vss boe and angelidaki 2012 falk et al 2015 molina et al 2009 morel et al 2005 nielsen et al 2007 steyer et al 2002 considering the typical practical limitations in ad instrumentation the list of required measurements in the proposed nmpc scheme including sadm for direct determination or estimation of key process variables and parameters is suggested in table 2 the significant issue is the lack of online estimation of microbial biomass concentrations conventional soft sensors or state estimators e g kalman filter or its variation particle filter can be used for slow delayed offline measurements e g methanogenic biomass activity tests specific for aceticlastic activity for the present application in support of having a semi mechanistic approach equations from the nmpc predictor model sadm were used to estimate the aceticlastic methanogenic biomass concentration at every sampling event for estimation via sadm the required set of initial model states are determined from the last available measurements also a 48 h delay in methanogenic activity measurement update was considered when utilizing measurements as initial points for the sadm state estimation of x ac the selected delay time was selected within the practical time durations required for the specific methanogenic activity tests according to the study of cho et al 2005 the method for state estimation of x ac at any given sampling event is illustrated in fig b of the supplementary material alternative methods could include the use of more complex model based state observers 2 3 start up of an ad plant treating a readily biodegradable soluble substrate case study the optimal start up control of an ad system treating readily biodegradable substrates has been selected as case scenario to evaluate the nmpc system developed the ad conditions have been adopted from subramanyam and mishra 2013 and a summary is shown in table 3 since the organic substrate in this example is a readily biodegradable substrate glucose the use of the proposed sadm as nmpc prediction model is possible the reactor configuration implemented by subramanyam and mishra 2013 is an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor a widely used high rate ad technology lier et al 2008 that can achieve high olrs due to its high biomass retention olrs as high as 60 kgcod m3 d can be achieved in case of expanded granular sludge bed and fluidized bed reactors 2 4 adm1 virtual plant to simulate the case study plant for start up an adm1 based virtual plant was used benchmark parameter values for the plant as reported in batstone et al 2002 for mesophilic high rate systems were used the parameters required by the much simpler nmpc prediction model sadm described in section 3 2 namely υ a c s υ c o 2 s υ c o 2 a c υ c o 2 h 2 υ h 2 s υ c h 4 a c υ c h 4 h 2 q m k s ph inhibition parameters k l a k d y x a c a c were derived directly from the benchmark adm1 ones the model parameters stoichiometric coefficients maximum specific rate of acetate uptake kinetics half saturation constant for acetate uptake kinetics and microbial biomass yields in the sadm can be easily obtained from ample existing ad modelling literature or estimated from the off line measurements e g volatile suspended solids activity tests cod of influent and effluent streams a maximum limit via an empirical function was imposed to the concentration of total solids in the virtual plant to ensure washout of excess solids from the system when nearing the maximum allowed this is needed due to the limited physical capacity of ad reactors for the accumulation of solids in cases of very high solids accumulation there will be removal of excess solids by natural means solids present in the reactor effluent and or through operational intervention feitosa cavalcanti et al 1999 this has been incorporated in both the sadm and the virtual plant adm1 where the model determines total solids at every iteration of the odes numerical solution and in comparison to a set threshold value the solids retention in the reactor is adjusted as the total solids approach or exceed the threshold level the srt approaches the reactor hrt with an empirical function or is imposed to be equal to the hrt respectively causing washout of solids accordingly for the ad start up control simulations the steady state initial microbial biomass proportions in the solids were taken as from an adapted inoculum and predicted from a preliminary simulation of the steady state of an ad reactor operating at the desired nominal conditions based on the ad start up and operation guidelines of hickey et al 1991 for high rate ad systems an inoculum quantity equal to 10 of the reactor volume was considered at start up the initial biomass concentrations for the preliminary simulations were estimated using the vss and sma values reported in table 3 all other values of state variables excluding the concentrations of microbial biomass and inorganic carbon inorganic nitrogen cations and anions were set as zero inside the reactor the interfacing of the adm1 based virtual plant outputs into nmpc and sadm compatible variables is shown in table 4 the effluent organic substrate concentration s s and co2 partial pressure p c o 2 updates from the virtual plant adm1 required for sadm equations are held constant when conducting sadm predictions during nmpc optimisation at a given sampling time instant at the next sampling event these previous updates are replaced with the latest values and the procedure is repeated the remaining virtual plant outputs except the methane production rate listed in table 4 are used as updated initial conditions for the sadm state variables for the next nmpc optimisation the aceticlastic biomass concentration x ac at a given sampling event is estimated via the state estimator as represented in fig b supplementary material for the update of the total alkalinity state variable z of the nmpc prediction model sadm virtual plant measured variables s ac eq s ic and ph are used to compute z as per eq 10 the proposed nmpc scheme was implemented in matlab r2015b matlab function files and a simulink file were created to deliver the control system implementation the adm1 based virtual plant was run using a modified version of the implementation framework by rodríguez et al 2009 the sadm odes were solved using the ode45 built in matlab solver to obtain the model predictions during nmpc optimisations lastly the nmpc optimisations were conducted using the fmincon built in matlab function with the sequential quadratic programming sqp algorithm the simulations were run on an intel core i5 3230 m 2 60 ghz processor with 8 00 gb ram 64 bit windows 10 operating system 3 results and discussion 3 1 proposed nmpc system architecture for optimal ad start up the optimal and automatic start up phase operation is proposed via a model predictive control mpc scheme due to the nonlinear nature of the prediction model specifically a nonlinear mpc nmpc scheme is proposed an introduction and brief description of the general mpc concept is described in appendix a of the supplementary material the overall architecture of the nmpc system proposed for ad start up is represented in fig 1 the control system involves the regulation of two or three depending on configuration control variables cvs around desired set points namely 1 effluent concentration of volatile fatty acids vfas as acetate s ac 2 concentration of aceticlastic methanogens in reactor x ac and 3 methane production rate rch4 as cv for one of the system configurations three manipulated variables mvs or control inputs are considered namely the volumetric inflow rates of 1 organic substrate q s 2 dilution water q h 2 o and 3 concentrated alkali input q a l k an ad hoc simple ad model sadm was specifically designed to be the prediction model for the nmpc and as an integral part of the system such that only input from available measurements in ad are required while also sufficient detail is returned in the model outputs to allow for the start up optimisation after every sampling time measured or estimated values of the process variables provide update on the latest state of the process and the nmpc optimises for the desired control objective function within constraints from that latest state using the prediction model sadm optimisation proceeds to find the set of optimal values for the mvs to apply to the ad process the nmpc objectives function aims at bringing the cvs to the set points x a c s p s a c s p r c h 4 s p as fast as possible and within specific state constraints throughout the selection of these cvs for the nmpc system fig 1 addresses already a number of important factors during start up such as effluent quality methanogenic activity particularly the aceticlastic group and actual cod removal via methanation the effluent quality in terms of vfa is an indirect indicator itself of cod removal and methanation and together with the achievement of a certain removal efficiency is one of the indicators of start up completion methane production rate is one of the common variables typically monitored to assessing ad output performance and it confirms the conversion and removal of cod from the system aceticlastic methanogens are the major methane producers amongst the two methanogenic groups the group with slowest growth rates lier et al 2008 and highly sensitive to a number of conditions such as ph temperature ammonia levels the limiting cod removal stage in ad processes is the aceticlastic methanogenesis which implies that the augmentation of this specific microbial biomass by favouring their growth is a clear strategy for effective ad start up lier et al 2008 this essential and process limiting nature of aceticlastic methanogens motivated the targeting of this biomass group as cv for the ad process start up in the nmpc system proposed in terms of manipulated variables the adjustment of the substrate flow rate during start up is an obvious choice of mv directly controlling olr which is one of the critical operational factors in start up performance dilution water has been included as mv as an option to e g deal with process acidification by diluting the accumulating vfas using water as a diluent during start up is not unusual dilution water was used in the study by angenent et al 2002 to control total vfa and nitrogen levels as ammonia during the start up phase of a full scale ad reactor 600 m3 treating swine waste finally concentrated alkali addition is the third mv as it is an option at a cost to increase the buffering capacity of the ad system and avoid acidification acid overload is a common problem during start up lagerkvist et al 2015 typically when treating readily biodegradable substrates 3 2 ad prediction model sadm for the nmpc a nonlinear very minimal ad model sadm in fig 1 was specifically designed as prediction model for the nmpc optimisations the model is based on the am2 model by bernard et al 2001 with specific modifications the reaction pathways incorporated are depicted in fig 2 a two step process is considered overall acidogenesis and methanogenesis as per the am2 model however in the sadm the hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis is also included as possible pathway for methanogenesis to more correctly estimate overall production of methane and for accurate cod balance conservation the main key assumptions that characterise this sadm prediction model include 1 two step process for the overall degradation of readily biodegradable organic substrate to methane acidogenesis and methanogenesis 2 instantaneous degradation of organic substrate to vfas 3 vfa intermediate products are primarily composed of acetate 4 methane production occurs through aceticlastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenic pathways 5 hydrogen produced from organic substrate acidogenesis is consumed rapidly or instantaneously in the hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis reaction 6 total alkalinity z is contributed from acetate anion intermediate alkalinity bicarbonate partial alkalinity and hydroxide ions alone the resulting sadm is a semi mechanistic model and is composed of the set of eqs 1 10 for well mixed ad systems with solids retention e g high rate ad reactor configurations with recycles and continuously stirred tank reactors cstrs with solids retention 3 2 1 ordinary

c h c o 3 o h as per model assumption 2 above the organic substrate utilization rate in eq 7 is simply equal to the net influx of the organic substrate by transport also by assuming rapid consumption of hydrogen during hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis assumption 5 the rate of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis in eq 9 is directly linked to the substrate utilization rate eq 7 for aceticlastic methanogenesis the acetate uptake rate kinetics model in eq 8 incorporating ph inhibition is adopted from adm1 batstone et al 2002 but without the inorganic nitrogen limitation and ammonia inhibition terms for estimation of liquid to gas transfer rate of the inorganic carbon state last term in eq 2 the gas phase partial pressure of co2 p c o 2 is taken from the plant output measurements for biogas with the proposed sadm structure and pathways the total methane production rate estimation defined in eq 6 is more accurate than the estimation in the am2 model of bernard et al 2001 finally since the control structure involves three mvs q s q h 2 o a n d q a l k the final dilution rate d after mixing of these input streams is given by eq 5 as shown in fig 3 the proposed sadm structure can be interfaced with available information from an ad system or plant to provide predictions of cvs and other relevant variables for the proposed nmpc scheme the kinetic parameters stoichiometric coefficients maximum specific rate of acetate uptake kinetics half saturation constant for acetate uptake kinetics and microbial biomass yields in the sadm can also be modified if needed from time to time from the plant measurements e g volatile suspended solids activity tests and cod of influent and effluent streams the proposed sadm structure represents a struggle between the need for simplicity and minimal input requirements for practical usability by real ad plant engineers relying on feasible measurements and the need for sufficient complexity to describe accurately the process start up with focus on the enrichment of aceticlastic methanogens 3 3 nmpc objective function and constraints according to the number of cvs targeted for optimal start up control two nmpc configurations were proposed in the first configuration denoted as nmpcbase all the three cvs x a c s p s a c s p r c h 4 s p are targeted and the resulting nmpc objective function proposed with constraints is given by

design denoted as nmpcno rch4 the objective function term for the methane production rate cv is not considered i e only 2 cvs are targeted the resulting nmpc objective function is given by eq 19 while the constraints remain the same as those defined for nmpcbase eqs 12 17 19 min q k j p w 1 k 1 k p s a c s a c s p m c o d a c s s i n f m c o d s s a c s p m c o d a c w 2 k 1 k p x a c k s p x a c k

penalises any additions of alkali supplement as that involves the use of chemicals at high cost the proposed objective function j p for nmpcbase and nmpcno rch4 i e eqs 11 and 19 is optimised over the prediction horizon p with a number of decision variables for the optimisation equal to the product of the number of mv variables and the control horizon m the constraint in eq 12 refers to the classical optimal control constraint where the optimisation has to follow the process dynamics as per the prediction model sadm for the nmpc system in this work the constraints in eqs 13 14 refer to limits on the total influent volumetric flow ensuring vertical upflow velocity remains between the range required these constraints are specifically applicable for high rate ad systems as it is the case scenario considered for evaluation where upflow liquid velocity v up is an important design parameter of hydraulic flow rate with a key role in sludge granulation de lemos chernicharo 2007 to prevent acid accumulation problems during start up a stability constraint given by eq 15 is defined to maintain the system within safe limits in particular several authors have supported the use of intermediate alkalinity to total alkalinity ratio as a successful stability diagnostic indicator that should be below a certain value i a t a m a x 0 3 in current work to ensure non inhibitory conditions towards the ad micro organisms particularly methanogens or neutral ph levels inside the reactor to avoid organic overloading and to operate the ad process within the practical ranges of olr a maximum allowable olr restriction eq 16 is considered finally eq 17 places a lower bound on the individual influent volumetric flows mvs to ensure positive values 3 4 performance evaluation of the nmpc ad start up on the virtual plant case scenario the start up process conditions nmpc tuning parameters cv set points and other variables used in the nmpc evaluation against the ad start up case scenario section 2 3 are shown in table 5 in existing mpc studies for optimal ad performance during normal or steady state operation a wide range of values for the tuning parameters have been found 15 min 60 days for the control horizon m and 12 5 h 250 days for the prediction horizon p gaida et al 2012 2011 haugen et al 2014 mauky et al 2016 ordace et al 2012 xue et al 2015 long time periods for m and p observed in many of these studies may not be necessary or applicable for the start up phase in the current work the base settings for the mpc tuning parameters m and p listed in table 5 were chosen after conducting a series of preliminary simulations where satisfactory performance was observed although these settings may not be necessarily optimal the target values of cv set points depend on the desired performance and objectives for the process start up in this case the target set points were defined as those of a fully steady state simulation of the virtual plant fully started up at its nominal operation with an organic substrate feeding at constant feed rate olr 15 kg m3 d a maximum permissible olr shown in table 5 was selected within the practical range of olrs for high rate ad systems the weights for the nmpc objective function terms w 1 w 2 w 3 w 4 were arbitrarily chosen with higher importance given to the set point tracking of x a c and r c h 4 cvs favouring build up of methanogenic capacity during start up the nmpc controllers are always disconnected once the target methane production rate i e set point is reached on the 39th day for nmpcbase and on the 18th day for the nmpcno rch4 with the olr and the dilution water flow rate set at 15 kgcod m3 d nominal olr and zero respectively the case scenario was evaluated also following a so called manual ad start up strategy as described by angelidaki et al 2006 in brief the organic feeding regime under this manual strategy consists of progressive increases in the olr calculated based on an activated biomass ab concept estimated via a linear correlation angelidaki et al 2006 the daily increase in ab is predicted and the olr to set each day is determined as a percentage of the ab pab accumulated till that time to determine the most appropriate value of pab to use three different values were tested 11 25 and 50 the external alkali input and dilution water flows were adjusted for the manual strategy to ensure stable performance and operation within the flow limits the olr values as per this manual strategy were fed till achievement of the nominal value of 15 kgcod m3 d fig 4 presents the ad start up performance for the two nmpc configurations nmpcbase and nmpcno rch4 in comparison to the manual strategy described above for three different pab values both nmpc and manual start up strategies as evaluated yielded stable onset of the ad performance fig 4 d f without any process destabilizations or failure in the long run fig 4 d f and h according to the adm1 based virtual plant predictions during start up however significant differences are evident in terms of the times required to reach near the cvs set points the organic substrate feeding paths followed and the process performance profiles during the initial periods for the manual strategy an olr at 11 pab resulted in superior performance of the methane production rate towards the set point fig 4 f and to a lesser extent of vfa accumulation fig 4 d however sluggish responses in cvs were obtained with the 11 pab set rate overall fig 4 d f due to the slow rate of olr increase simulations with higher values of pab 25 and 50 yielded faster responses in olr and cvs but at the cost of lower methane production rates at steady state and higher extents of vfa as acetate accumulation during start up phase for the proposed nmpc configurations the one including methane production rate as an active objective function term i e nmpc base leads to a start up strategy with a very aggressive initial feeding at very high olrs contrary to conventional practices as seen in fig 4 a and g but at a high expense of alkali dosing initially fig 4 c for the other nmpc configuration in which methane production rate is not an active objective function term nmpcno rch4 the start up proposed follows a low to higher olr feeding strategy more in line with conventional start up practices under very low requirement of alkali input in the long run however the required levels of alkali dosing are different the values of the overall as well as of individual terms contributions to the nmpc objective functions eqs 11 and 19 after optimisations are shown in fig c of the supplementary material appendix c the specifically developed prediction model for the nmpc sadm showed excellent agreement with the much complex virtual plant model adm1 when looking at the process output predictions of x ac and ph this is shown in appendix d of the supplementary material figs d1 d2 the proposed sadm based state estimator of x ac also showed good agreement with the virtual plant adm1 output even though past and delayed offline measurement information is used in the estimations fig d3 of the supplementary material appendix d the moderate mismatches on the s ac and the r ch4 between sadm and adm1 may have caused some of the intermittent oscillations in the process mvs and cvs under the nmpc fig 4 model inaccuracy issues can be partly overcome in mpc by implementing output feedback strategies which use an output bias correction seborg et al 2011 where the errors or biases between the latest plant measurements and the k 1 th sampling time instant model predictions from previous sampling instant can be added as corrections to the model predictions when conducting control calculations at the latest sampling instant the nmpc controllers achieved successful ad performance targets during start up using the simple prediction model sadm developed with its obvious limitations a number of quantitative assessments had been conducted for a clearer comparison and additional analyses of the tested start up operation and control strategies table 6 summarizes the results obtained using the different quantitative indicators the itae criterion an integral error criterion used in controller design or tuning gives an indication of the overall performance along the process operation duration in terms of the time weighted errors between the process outputs and the set points for the steady state offset errors as percentages reported in table 6 a zero or negative value for the s ac cv and a zero or positive value for the x ac or r ch4 cv corresponds to achievement of the corresponding set point at steady state in terms of achieving the nominal olr of 15 kgcod m3 d the manual strategy with 50 pab set sate for olr and the nmpc design without the methane production rate cv nmpc no rch4 was the fastest however the manual strategy with 50 pab set rate affects the ad performance output of the cvs when looking at the values of integral of the time weighted absolute error between set point and the cv itae criterion and the cv offset errors at steady state reported in table 6 comparing the itae and steady state offset values of the x ac and r ch4 cvs across the tested strategies the nmpc designs provide a significant advantage over the manual strategies in general also looking at fig 4 f both nmpc scenarios lead to faster start up of the process in comparison to the manual strategy in terms of the methane production output circa 39 days and 18 days for nmpc base and nmpcnorch4 respectively versus 70 75 days for the manual strategies with constant offset errors at steady state as seen in table 6 and achievement of nominal olr of 15 kgcod m3 d fig 4 g in terms of the fastest achievement of cvs toward the set points with minor offset error in s ac at steady state and the nominal olr the simpler nmpc design without targeting the methane production cv i e nmpc no rch4 appears to be the preferred choice for automatic and optimal ad start up management also successful onset of the process stable levels of cvs and ph is predicted after switching off the nmpc fig 4 d f and h alkali dosing in the long run could be later adjusted manually or by another control scheme however this falls outside the target of this work focused on start up alone the proposed nmpc system can however be redesigned for other operation targets via redefinition of the optimisation problem 3 5 robustness and performance analyses of the nmpc ad start up under different scenarios a number of practical case studies and scenarios were evaluated to assess the two nmpc designs nmpc base and nmpcno rch4 for robustness and possible improvements the details on these scenarios and the results obtained have been provided in appendix e of the supplementary material in brief the following cases were simulated 1 model sadm mismatch bias correction in which at each sampling event the differences between the plant outputs and sadm predictions are added as corrections to the sadm predictions for the next nmpc optimisation step 2 assumption of online x ac measurement availibility without any delays i e no x ac estimator in order to assess the impact of the state estimator 3 instrument error via random noise ranging between 10 and 10 change relative to actual measurements of the four sadm states and ch4 production rate 4 measured disturbances of substrate influent cod 2 tests 75 decrease and 75 increase in the base influent cod of 2 75 gcod l at 10th day for 15 days 5 unmeasured disturbances of substrate influent cod 4 tests 5 and 75 random changes in influent cod of 2 75gcod l 80 decrease and 80 increase in influent cod of 2 75gcod l at 10th day for 15 days the results figures and quantitative assessments for the above cases are provided in the appendix e of the supplementary material table e and figs e1 a to e5 h for the scenario involving model bias correction both nmpc designs yield faster performance with respect to switching to manual operation at constant nominal olr of 15 kgcod m3 d table e in appendix e compared to the results in table 6 however the nmpcbase design yields constant cv offset errors relative to set points table e and figs e1 a d f indicating that the set points for the x ac and ch4 production rate could not be reached at steady state the nmpcno rch4 yields a better performance according to the values of itae and cv set point offset errors table e and figs e1 b d f when compared to the results with nmpc base with the assumption of xac online measurement availability the nmpcbase design yields stable performance but is unable to drive the process towards the cv set points fig e2 a d f which was unexpected with the nmpc no rch4 design the start up performance table e and fig e2 b in appendix e is similar to that obtained under base scenario table 6 and fig 4 this indicates that the estimator works well without the availability of online measurement for x ac this is expected due to the previous good agreement between the estimator and the plant output for x ac fig d3 in appendix d of the supplementary material despite the instrument errors occurring throughout the process operation time both nmpc designs yield satisfactory results as the process is driven towards the cv set points without any failures table e and figs e3 a to e3 b in appendix e and without any oscillations in the optimal set of mvs implemented by the nmpc with measured disturbances of the influent cod of the substrate the nmpcbase design yields stable performance but with significant intermediate variations of cvs fig e4 a in appendix e for the disturbance involving reduction in influent cod however when subjected to disturbance involving increase in influent cod the start up performance is significantly poor with the nmpcbase design table e and fig e4 c d f in appendix e irrespective of the nature of disturbance the nmpcno rch4 yields stable performance while successfully meeting the cv set points at steady state but with oscillatory behavior and variations during start up figs e4 b and e4 d in appendix e also the time taken to switch to the nominal olr of 15kgcod m3 d and for conditions to stabilize around the set points is longer when the disturbance involves reduction in influent cod table e in appendix e under unmeasured disturbances in the influent cod i e the sadm is unaware of the changes in substrate influent cod concentration both nmpc designs are able to drive the process towards the set points without any stability issues however intermediate variations in cvs are observed in general figs e5 a to e5 h also nmpcno rch4 yields highly oscillatory behavior in some cases fig e5 h in appendix e in summary the nmpcno rch4 configuration appears to provide a more robust and superior performance compared to the nmpcbase alternative configuration against the different scenarios tested the nmpcbase fails to drive the process towards the set points for a number of the scenarios considered this indicates that the nmpc objective function formulation or in other words the process variables targeted for optimisation plays a key role in the level of success of the nmpc scheme for start up also these results could indicate that the unconventional method of starting with a high olr at the beginning of operation during start up according to nmpcbase design may not be an effective strategy despite its possible apparent optimality respect to the conventional approach of low to high olr 4 conclusion an nmpc system was developed to optimally start up high rate ad reactors consisting of a specifically designed objective function and a prediction model requiring only minimal practically feasible sets of measurements the nmpc evaluation on an adm1 based virtual plant start up for the case scenario of a high rate ad uasb reactor treating readily biodegradable substrate glucose produced positive results process stability stable levels of effluent acetate aceticlastic methanogens and methane production over time without any upsets and superior performance in terms of time required to reach methane production targets were obtained these results imply that an ad plant could be effectively started up with the proposed nmpc system using a minimal set of conventional measurements two very different start up feeding strategies were obtained from the two nmpc configurations proposed the nmpc configuration including methane production rate as an active objective function term delivers a very aggressive high to low olr feeding profile at high alkali cost the second alternative nmpc configuration without the methane production rate as target delivers a low to high more conventional olr feeding strategy at lower alkali cost and achieves the best performance in terms of start up time the prediction ad model sadm developed integral part of the nmpc system showed excellent agreement with the complex adm1 based virtual plant for some of the key ad process outputs based on a number of cases evaluated to assess the nmpc robustness and possible improvements the nmpc design without the ch4 production rate cv as term in the objective function nmpcno rch4 yielded superior performance compared to the nmpc base design this indicates that the variables targeted in the nmpc objective function for start up control play a key role in the efficiency and optimal management of the start up phase operation although the results obtained are very promising the developed nmpc system requires experimental validation in a real ad reactor further studies for controller parameter tuning as well as on the prediction model and impact of the weighting of the nmpc objective function terms are recommended a natural next step to build up on the start up strategy presented here is its further development towards an nmpc scheme for ad processes treating complex substrates and those with inhibitory components all these will contribute to fully evaluate the broader practical feasibility of the proposed nmpc control scheme for optimal automatic ad start up declaration of

18042,the optimal automatic start up of anaerobic digesters has remained an elusive problem over the years to be solved at the lowest possible costs including that of process monitoring in this work a non linear model predictive control nmpc system was developed under two proposed configurations for the optimal start up of anaerobic digesters treating soluble non recalcitrant substrates the minimum set of low cost practical control variables cvs selected for process start up include i the effluent quality as acetate cod ii the level of aceticlastic methanogenic biomass in the reactor and iii the methane production rate only for one of the nmpc configurations the manipulated variables mvs consist of the volumetric inflow rates of the organic substrate dilution water and of a possible concentrated alkali addition to be able to apply the above selected cvs technically and economically feasible to measure estimate a simplified tailored ad model was specifically designed as the prediction model integral part of the nmpc system the nmpc system developed was evaluated for a case scenario consisting of the automatic start up of a high rate ad reactor treating a readily biodegradable carbohydrate based substrate the ad plant was virtually represented by the complex anaerobic digestion model no 1 compared to other manual start up strategies the two configurations of the nmpc developed appeared to reach the target methane production rate faster 39 and 18 days for the nmpc versus 70 75 days for the manual strategies together with an overall superior cv set point tracking error performance interestingly the two configurations of the nmpc developed appear to propose two very different almost opposite start up feeding strategies to both eventually start up the reactor successfully with no process destabilizations throughout a number of practical scenarios were also considered to evaluate the nmpc configurations for robustness and any possible improvements these tests indicate that the nmpc objective function formulation is a key factor of the success and robustness exhibited during start up graphical abstract image 1 keywords anaerobic digestion

subscript k sampling time instant lb lower bound superscript sp set point 1 introduction anaerobic digestion ad is a mature efficient and renewable biotechnology for organic waste removal stabilization and or energy recovery that has been successfully and widely implemented for treatment of a variety of substrates ad is a biological process in which organic matter is degraded in absence of oxygen to generate methane and co2 biogas as the major end products however ad involves a complex network of interactions between different groups of micro organisms that need specific conditions to survive and remain active since they are sensitive to changes in process conditions for any given ad system start up can be a crucial phase as it can determine the entire progression of the system and an ineffective start up can lead to inefficient process onsets e g sub optimal or unstable performance in terms of organic matter removal and biogas production practically ad start up is one of the major operational obstacles owing to the slow growth rate of the key ad microorganisms particularly methanogens and the adaptation requirements of the micro organisms towards the new conditions owing to these limitations and in absence of a well adapted inoculum ad systems could require long times to start up 2 8 months before reaching full performance capacity de lemos chernicharo 2007 lier et al 2008 puñal et al 2000 for ad systems the reduction of start up times is an important factor to increase efficiency and technical competitiveness de lemos chernicharo 2007 and to minimize costs holubar et al 2003 an efficient operational control and optimisation during ad process start up can be beneficial and economical in safely driving the system towards an optimal operation sbarciog and vande wouwer 2014 a number of factors affect the ad start up phase such as feed characteristics type composition and concentration seed sludge or inoculum characteristics quality microbial community profile and relative proportion of micro organisms with respect to each other feed loading rates hydraulic retention time hrt and solids retention time srt goberna et al 2015 janke et al 2016 pandey et al 2011 vadlani and ramachandran 2008 several experimental studies focusing on operational aspects ranging from lab scale to full scale systems testing exist in literature that have focused on one or more of these factors to propose strategies for effective and or rapid start up of ad systems alvarado lassman et al 2010 angelidaki et al 2006 angenent et al 2002 borzacconi et al 2006 dong et al 2010 fdéz güelfo et al 2010 goux et al 2016 janke et al 2016 lagerkvist et al 2015 liang et al 2017 lloret et al 2013 meng et al 2014 pandey et al 2011 puñal et al 2000 vadlani and ramachandran 2008 williams et al 2013 based on these studies the ad start up phase has been typically considered complete after achievement of one or more of the following design organic loading rates olr stable and non inhibitory levels of volatile fatty acids vfas and or ph adequate substrate removal efficiencies stable biogas production in terms of flow methane content and or composition in terms of operational strategy feeding regime e g olr and nutrients supply and inoculation procedures e g inoculum availability characteristics and amount have been major factors affecting the ad performance during start up according to the existing experimental studies on ad start up careful feeding regime is critical during ad start up to allow the sensitive micro organisms to adapt to the different or changing environments and also to avoid any destabilizations in case of feed overloads and or acidification inside the reactor as such it is commonly observed across the existing studies that the ad systems are started up after carrying out any necessary inoculation procedures by feeding in a gradual manner i e the olr is low initially and then gradually increased according to the status of the digester e g vfa levels ph and biogas production although the results have been successful such manual operational feeding strategies provide no assurance of optimality and are likely suboptimal fearing the ad process destabilization some plant operators reject valuable feed during start up phase holubar et al 2003 also according to some technical reports and guides on biogas plant monitoring and operation starting up with significantly low organic loads is not advised since it can lower ad plant productivity and negatively impact microbial growth due to lack of adequate food supply drosg 2013 esteves et al 2012 these limitations indicate that better and optimal operational start up management strategies are still needed for start up with this regard efficient and robust control design becomes essential few studies exist in the literature that have focused on control schemes for ad during start up or restart up amongst these studies summarized in table 1 implementation of model based control strategies for ad start up has shown to be effective and promising aiming for optimal operation during ad start up can help in increasing the practical feasibility of ad technology at large scale for such scenario implementation of optimal control strategies process control while aiming for optimal process performance is highly attractive an example of such strategy is the model predictive control mpc where model predictions and latest measurements are used to determine the set of control input or manipulated variable mv changes that can optimally drive the control outputs or variables cvs to their desired targets set points seborg et al 2011 a characteristic feature of mpc contributing to its success is the consideration of constraints while carrying out the control optimisations grüne and pannek 2011 very few studies exist in literature on mpc implementation for ad systems gaida et al 2012 2011 haugen et al 2014 kil et al 2017 mauky et al 2016 ordace et al 2012 xue et al 2015 but mpc studies particularly focusing on ad start up have not been found nevertheless these studies have shown the effectiveness of mpc strategy for controlling ad systems and its flexibility in implementing different control designs and scenarios a critical factor in the success of model based controllers including mpc is the availability of an accurate and reliable model moreover since such controllers require execution of models with minimum computational intensity models that can give reliable predictions of the complex ad process while having minimal structural complexities are needed on the other hand for virtual testing scenarios prior to experimental testing using reliably structured and complex ad models as virtual plants is necessary for accurate representation of the process plant behaviour with accurate virtual plant models the proposed control schemes can be justly evaluated and assessed on the practical side effective and sufficient monitoring procedures are important for successful operation of an ad process however the few number of variables monitored on line in commercial scale ad systems presents a limitation on the development of effective control strategies where the number and type of variables monitored on line to effectively assess the status of an ad process are a critical component equipment availability skilled personnel availability monitoring costs and difference in opinions of technical consultants are the major factors affecting the extent of monitoring e g number of variables measured and frequency implemented in real life ad plants drosg 2013 however when looking at monitoring costs one should also evaluate the economic losses resulting from insufficient monitoring drosg 2013 in case of achieving an effective ad start up monitoring efforts should be particularly highest since this is a very sensitive phase drosg 2013 considering the start up challenges and limited progress in designing controllers for effective ad start up management a nonlinear model predictive control nmpc scheme is developed in this work for automatic optimal start up of an anaerobic digestion ad system the control scheme is proposed with its practical implementation in mind based on the use of feasible to measure process variables and a specifically designed ad simple prediction model for the nmpc optimisations the nmpc system was implemented under two different configurations and evaluated against an ad case scenario 2 materials and methods 2 1 adm1 based virtual ad plant for nmpc evaluation the comprehensive and widely accepted adm1 by batstone et al 2002 was selected for the most possible accurate in silico representation of the real ad process plant against which the control scheme is being designed and evaluated adm1 is a highly complex model capable of describing the ad process dynamics to great detail it is however a large model requiring large amounts of input information in terms of parameters and influent characteristics as well as being computationally demanding these two reasons make adm1 computationally unfeasible as the prediction model for the nmpc system developed here a virtual ad plant based on the adm1 was implemented to evaluate the performance of the nmpc system developed in this work an empirical correlation not originally included in the adm1 between solids retention time srt with the liquid upflow velocity v up relevant for high rate ad systems was incorporated in the virtual plant model adm1 as well as in the nmpc prediction model sadm based on the solids retention formulations of fedorovich et al 2003 2 2 ad process monitoring during automatic operation the sets of measurements typically available in ad process monitoring are rarely sufficient to fully evaluate and assess the state of the process jimenez et al 2015 although a variety of variables are monitored in commercial scale ad plants the number of variables typically measured online is quite limited ph temperature biogas flow rate biogas composition and partial pressures while a majority are measured off line and less frequently incurring in gaps and information delays however as a result of recent research advanced and novel sensors have been developed for online monitoring of key variables jimenez et al 2015 a number of studies have successfully developed online measurement tools for vfa levels alkalinities partial and total cod and volatile suspended solids vss boe and angelidaki 2012 falk et al 2015 molina et al 2009 morel et al 2005 nielsen et al 2007 steyer et al 2002 considering the typical practical limitations in ad instrumentation the list of required measurements in the proposed nmpc scheme including sadm for direct determination or estimation of key process variables and parameters is suggested in table 2 the significant issue is the lack of online estimation of microbial biomass concentrations conventional soft sensors or state estimators e g kalman filter or its variation particle filter can be used for slow delayed offline measurements e g methanogenic biomass activity tests specific for aceticlastic activity for the present application in support of having a semi mechanistic approach equations from the nmpc predictor model sadm were used to estimate the aceticlastic methanogenic biomass concentration at every sampling event for estimation via sadm the required set of initial model states are determined from the last available measurements also a 48 h delay in methanogenic activity measurement update was considered when utilizing measurements as initial points for the sadm state estimation of x ac the selected delay time was selected within the practical time durations required for the specific methanogenic activity tests according to the study of cho et al 2005 the method for state estimation of x ac at any given sampling event is illustrated in fig b of the supplementary material alternative methods could include the use of more complex model based state observers 2 3 start up of an ad plant treating a readily biodegradable soluble substrate case study the optimal start up control of an ad system treating readily biodegradable substrates has been selected as case scenario to evaluate the nmpc system developed the ad conditions have been adopted from subramanyam and mishra 2013 and a summary is shown in table 3 since the organic substrate in this example is a readily biodegradable substrate glucose the use of the proposed sadm as nmpc prediction model is possible the reactor configuration implemented by subramanyam and mishra 2013 is an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor a widely used high rate ad technology lier et al 2008 that can achieve high olrs due to its high biomass retention olrs as high as 60 kgcod m3 d can be achieved in case of expanded granular sludge bed and fluidized bed reactors 2 4 adm1 virtual plant to simulate the case study plant for start up an adm1 based virtual plant was used benchmark parameter values for the plant as reported in batstone et al 2002 for mesophilic high rate systems were used the parameters required by the much simpler nmpc prediction model sadm described in section 3 2 namely υ a c s υ c o 2 s υ c o 2 a c υ c o 2 h 2 υ h 2 s υ c h 4 a c υ c h 4 h 2 q m k s ph inhibition parameters k l a k d y x a c a c were derived directly from the benchmark adm1 ones the model parameters stoichiometric coefficients maximum specific rate of acetate uptake kinetics half saturation constant for acetate uptake kinetics and microbial biomass yields in the sadm can be easily obtained from ample existing ad modelling literature or estimated from the off line measurements e g volatile suspended solids activity tests cod of influent and effluent streams a maximum limit via an empirical function was imposed to the concentration of total solids in the virtual plant to ensure washout of excess solids from the system when nearing the maximum allowed this is needed due to the limited physical capacity of ad reactors for the accumulation of solids in cases of very high solids accumulation there will be removal of excess solids by natural means solids present in the reactor effluent and or through operational intervention feitosa cavalcanti et al 1999 this has been incorporated in both the sadm and the virtual plant adm1 where the model determines total solids at every iteration of the odes numerical solution and in comparison to a set threshold value the solids retention in the reactor is adjusted as the total solids approach or exceed the threshold level the srt approaches the reactor hrt with an empirical function or is imposed to be equal to the hrt respectively causing washout of solids accordingly for the ad start up control simulations the steady state initial microbial biomass proportions in the solids were taken as from an adapted inoculum and predicted from a preliminary simulation of the steady state of an ad reactor operating at the desired nominal conditions based on the ad start up and operation guidelines of hickey et al 1991 for high rate ad systems an inoculum quantity equal to 10 of the reactor volume was considered at start up the initial biomass concentrations for the preliminary simulations were estimated using the vss and sma values reported in table 3 all other values of state variables excluding the concentrations of microbial biomass and inorganic carbon inorganic nitrogen cations and anions were set as zero inside the reactor the interfacing of the adm1 based virtual plant outputs into nmpc and sadm compatible variables is shown in table 4 the effluent organic substrate concentration s s and co2 partial pressure p c o 2 updates from the virtual plant adm1 required for sadm equations are held constant when conducting sadm predictions during nmpc optimisation at a given sampling time instant at the next sampling event these previous updates are replaced with the latest values and the procedure is repeated the remaining virtual plant outputs except the methane production rate listed in table 4 are used as updated initial conditions for the sadm state variables for the next nmpc optimisation the aceticlastic biomass concentration x ac at a given sampling event is estimated via the state estimator as represented in fig b supplementary material for the update of the total alkalinity state variable z of the nmpc prediction model sadm virtual plant measured variables s ac eq s ic and ph are used to compute z as per eq 10 the proposed nmpc scheme was implemented in matlab r2015b matlab function files and a simulink file were created to deliver the control system implementation the adm1 based virtual plant was run using a modified version of the implementation framework by rodríguez et al 2009 the sadm odes were solved using the ode45 built in matlab solver to obtain the model predictions during nmpc optimisations lastly the nmpc optimisations were conducted using the fmincon built in matlab function with the sequential quadratic programming sqp algorithm the simulations were run on an intel core i5 3230 m 2 60 ghz processor with 8 00 gb ram 64 bit windows 10 operating system 3 results and discussion 3 1 proposed nmpc system architecture for optimal ad start up the optimal and automatic start up phase operation is proposed via a model predictive control mpc scheme due to the nonlinear nature of the prediction model specifically a nonlinear mpc nmpc scheme is proposed an introduction and brief description of the general mpc concept is described in appendix a of the supplementary material the overall architecture of the nmpc system proposed for ad start up is represented in fig 1 the control system involves the regulation of two or three depending on configuration control variables cvs around desired set points namely 1 effluent concentration of volatile fatty acids vfas as acetate s ac 2 concentration of aceticlastic methanogens in reactor x ac and 3 methane production rate rch4 as cv for one of the system configurations three manipulated variables mvs or control inputs are considered namely the volumetric inflow rates of 1 organic substrate q s 2 dilution water q h 2 o and 3 concentrated alkali input q a l k an ad hoc simple ad model sadm was specifically designed to be the prediction model for the nmpc and as an integral part of the system such that only input from available measurements in ad are required while also sufficient detail is returned in the model outputs to allow for the start up optimisation after every sampling time measured or estimated values of the process variables provide update on the latest state of the process and the nmpc optimises for the desired control objective function within constraints from that latest state using the prediction model sadm optimisation proceeds to find the set of optimal values for the mvs to apply to the ad process the nmpc objectives function aims at bringing the cvs to the set points x a c s p s a c s p r c h 4 s p as fast as possible and within specific state constraints throughout the selection of these cvs for the nmpc system fig 1 addresses already a number of important factors during start up such as effluent quality methanogenic activity particularly the aceticlastic group and actual cod removal via methanation the effluent quality in terms of vfa is an indirect indicator itself of cod removal and methanation and together with the achievement of a certain removal efficiency is one of the indicators of start up completion methane production rate is one of the common variables typically monitored to assessing ad output performance and it confirms the conversion and removal of cod from the system aceticlastic methanogens are the major methane producers amongst the two methanogenic groups the group with slowest growth rates lier et al 2008 and highly sensitive to a number of conditions such as ph temperature ammonia levels the limiting cod removal stage in ad processes is the aceticlastic methanogenesis which implies that the augmentation of this specific microbial biomass by favouring their growth is a clear strategy for effective ad start up lier et al 2008 this essential and process limiting nature of aceticlastic methanogens motivated the targeting of this biomass group as cv for the ad process start up in the nmpc system proposed in terms of manipulated variables the adjustment of the substrate flow rate during start up is an obvious choice of mv directly controlling olr which is one of the critical operational factors in start up performance dilution water has been included as mv as an option to e g deal with process acidification by diluting the accumulating vfas using water as a diluent during start up is not unusual dilution water was used in the study by angenent et al 2002 to control total vfa and nitrogen levels as ammonia during the start up phase of a full scale ad reactor 600 m3 treating swine waste finally concentrated alkali addition is the third mv as it is an option at a cost to increase the buffering capacity of the ad system and avoid acidification acid overload is a common problem during start up lagerkvist et al 2015 typically when treating readily biodegradable substrates 3 2 ad prediction model sadm for the nmpc a nonlinear very minimal ad model sadm in fig 1 was specifically designed as prediction model for the nmpc optimisations the model is based on the am2 model by bernard et al 2001 with specific modifications the reaction pathways incorporated are depicted in fig 2 a two step process is considered overall acidogenesis and methanogenesis as per the am2 model however in the sadm the hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis is also included as possible pathway for methanogenesis to more correctly estimate overall production of methane and for accurate cod balance conservation the main key assumptions that characterise this sadm prediction model include 1 two step process for the overall degradation of readily biodegradable organic substrate to methane acidogenesis and methanogenesis 2 instantaneous degradation of organic substrate to vfas 3 vfa intermediate products are primarily composed of acetate 4 methane production occurs through aceticlastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenic pathways 5 hydrogen produced from organic substrate acidogenesis is consumed rapidly or instantaneously in the hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis reaction 6 total alkalinity z is contributed from acetate anion intermediate alkalinity bicarbonate partial alkalinity and hydroxide ions alone the resulting sadm is a semi mechanistic model and is composed of the set of eqs 1 10 for well mixed ad systems with solids retention e g high rate ad reactor configurations with recycles and continuously stirred tank reactors cstrs with solids retention 3 2 1 ordinary

c h c o 3 o h as per model assumption 2 above the organic substrate utilization rate in eq 7 is simply equal to the net influx of the organic substrate by transport also by assuming rapid consumption of hydrogen during hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis assumption 5 the rate of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis in eq 9 is directly linked to the substrate utilization rate eq 7 for aceticlastic methanogenesis the acetate uptake rate kinetics model in eq 8 incorporating ph inhibition is adopted from adm1 batstone et al 2002 but without the inorganic nitrogen limitation and ammonia inhibition terms for estimation of liquid to gas transfer rate of the inorganic carbon state last term in eq 2 the gas phase partial pressure of co2 p c o 2 is taken from the plant output measurements for biogas with the proposed sadm structure and pathways the total methane production rate estimation defined in eq 6 is more accurate than the estimation in the am2 model of bernard et al 2001 finally since the control structure involves three mvs q s q h 2 o a n d q a l k the final dilution rate d after mixing of these input streams is given by eq 5 as shown in fig 3 the proposed sadm structure can be interfaced with available information from an ad system or plant to provide predictions of cvs and other relevant variables for the proposed nmpc scheme the kinetic parameters stoichiometric coefficients maximum specific rate of acetate uptake kinetics half saturation constant for acetate uptake kinetics and microbial biomass yields in the sadm can also be modified if needed from time to time from the plant measurements e g volatile suspended solids activity tests and cod of influent and effluent streams the proposed sadm structure represents a struggle between the need for simplicity and minimal input requirements for practical usability by real ad plant engineers relying on feasible measurements and the need for sufficient complexity to describe accurately the process start up with focus on the enrichment of aceticlastic methanogens 3 3 nmpc objective function and constraints according to the number of cvs targeted for optimal start up control two nmpc configurations were proposed in the first configuration denoted as nmpcbase all the three cvs x a c s p s a c s p r c h 4 s p are targeted and the resulting nmpc objective function proposed with constraints is given by eqs 11 17 11 min q k j p w 1 k 1 k p s a c s a c s p m c o d a c s s i n f m c o d s s a c s p m c o d a c w 2 k 1 k p x a c k s p x a c k x a c k s p w 3 k 1 k p r c h 4 k s p r c h 4 k r c h 4 k s p

design denoted as nmpcno rch4 the objective function term for the methane production rate cv is not considered i e only 2 cvs are targeted the resulting nmpc objective function is given by eq 19 while the constraints remain the same as those defined for nmpcbase eqs 12 17 19 min q k j p w 1 k 1 k p s a c s a c s p m c o d a c s s i n f m c o d s s a c s p m c o d a c w 2 k 1 k p x a c k s p x a c k

penalises any additions of alkali supplement as that involves the use of chemicals at high cost the proposed objective function j p for nmpcbase and nmpcno rch4 i e eqs 11 and 19 is optimised over the prediction horizon p with a number of decision variables for the optimisation equal to the product of the number of mv variables and the control horizon m the constraint in eq 12 refers to the classical optimal control constraint where the optimisation has to follow the process dynamics as per the prediction model sadm for the nmpc system in this work the constraints in eqs 13 14 refer to limits on the total influent volumetric flow ensuring vertical upflow velocity remains between the range required these constraints are specifically applicable for high rate ad systems as it is the case scenario considered for evaluation where upflow liquid velocity v up is an important design parameter of hydraulic flow rate with a key role in sludge granulation de lemos chernicharo 2007 to prevent acid accumulation problems during start up a stability constraint given by eq 15 is defined to maintain the system within safe limits in particular several authors have supported the use of intermediate alkalinity to total alkalinity ratio as a successful stability diagnostic indicator that should be below a certain value i a t a m a x 0 3 in current work to ensure non inhibitory conditions towards the ad micro organisms particularly methanogens or neutral ph levels inside the reactor to avoid organic overloading and to operate the ad process within the practical ranges of olr a maximum allowable olr restriction eq 16 is considered finally eq 17 places a lower bound on the individual influent volumetric flows mvs to ensure positive values 3 4 performance evaluation of the nmpc ad start up on the virtual plant case scenario the start up process conditions nmpc tuning parameters cv set points and other variables used in the nmpc evaluation against the ad start up case scenario section 2 3 are shown in table 5 in existing mpc studies for optimal ad performance during normal or steady state operation a wide range of values for the tuning parameters have been found 15 min 60 days for the control horizon m and 12 5 h 250 days for the prediction horizon p gaida et al 2012 2011 haugen et al 2014 mauky et al 2016 ordace et al 2012 xue et al 2015 long time periods for m and p observed in many of these studies may not be necessary or applicable for the start up phase in the current work the base settings for the mpc tuning parameters m and p listed in table 5 were chosen after conducting a series of preliminary simulations where satisfactory performance was observed although these settings may not be necessarily optimal the target values of cv set points depend on the desired performance and objectives for the process start up in this case the target set points were defined as those of a fully steady state simulation of the virtual plant fully started up at its nominal operation with an organic substrate feeding at constant feed rate olr 15 kg m3 d a maximum permissible olr shown in table 5 was selected within the practical range of olrs for high rate ad systems the weights for the nmpc objective function terms w 1 w 2 w 3 w 4 were arbitrarily chosen with higher importance given to the set point tracking of x a c and r c h 4 cvs favouring build up of methanogenic capacity during start up the nmpc controllers are always disconnected once the target methane production rate i e set point is reached on the 39th day for nmpcbase and on the 18th day for the nmpcno rch4 with the olr and the dilution water flow rate set at 15 kgcod m3 d nominal olr and zero respectively the case scenario was evaluated also following a so called manual ad start up strategy as described by angelidaki et al 2006 in brief the organic feeding regime under this manual strategy consists of progressive increases in the olr calculated based on an activated biomass ab concept estimated via a linear correlation angelidaki et al 2006 the daily increase in ab is predicted and the olr to set each day is determined as a percentage of the ab pab accumulated till that time to determine the most appropriate value of pab to use three different values were tested 11 25 and 50 the external alkali input and dilution water flows were adjusted for the manual strategy to ensure stable performance and operation within the flow limits the olr values as per this manual strategy were fed till achievement of the nominal value of 15 kgcod m3 d fig 4 presents the ad start up performance for the two nmpc configurations nmpcbase and nmpcno rch4 in comparison to the manual strategy described above for three different pab values both nmpc and manual start up strategies as evaluated yielded stable onset of the ad performance fig 4 d f without any process destabilizations or failure in the long run fig 4 d f and h according to the adm1 based virtual plant predictions during start up however significant differences are evident in terms of the times required to reach near the cvs set points the organic substrate feeding paths followed and the process performance profiles during the initial periods for the manual strategy an olr at 11 pab resulted in superior performance of the methane production rate towards the set point fig 4 f and to a lesser extent of vfa accumulation fig 4 d however sluggish responses in cvs were obtained with the 11 pab set rate overall fig 4 d f due to the slow rate of olr increase simulations with higher values of pab 25 and 50 yielded faster responses in olr and cvs but at the cost of lower methane production rates at steady state and higher extents of vfa as acetate accumulation during start up phase for the proposed nmpc configurations the one including methane production rate as an active objective function term i e nmpc base leads to a start up strategy with a very aggressive initial feeding at very high olrs contrary to conventional practices as seen in fig 4 a and g but at a high expense of alkali dosing initially fig 4 c for the other nmpc configuration in which methane production rate is not an active objective function term nmpcno rch4 the start up proposed follows a low to higher olr feeding strategy more in line with conventional start up practices under very low requirement of alkali input in the long run however the required levels of alkali dosing are different the values of the overall as well as of individual terms contributions to the nmpc objective functions eqs 11 and 19 after optimisations are shown in fig c of the supplementary material appendix c the specifically developed prediction model for the nmpc sadm showed excellent agreement with the much complex virtual plant model adm1 when looking at the process output predictions of x ac and ph this is shown in appendix d of the supplementary material figs d1 d2 the proposed sadm based state estimator of x ac also showed good agreement with the virtual plant adm1 output even though past and delayed offline measurement information is used in the estimations fig d3 of the supplementary material appendix d the moderate mismatches on the s ac and the r ch4 between sadm and adm1 may have caused some of the intermittent oscillations in the process mvs and cvs under the nmpc fig 4 model inaccuracy issues can be partly overcome in mpc by implementing output feedback strategies which use an output bias correction seborg et al 2011 where the errors or biases between the latest plant measurements and the k 1 th sampling time instant model predictions from previous sampling instant can be added as corrections to the model predictions when conducting control calculations at the latest sampling instant the nmpc controllers achieved successful ad performance targets during start up using the simple prediction model sadm developed with its obvious limitations a number of quantitative assessments had been conducted for a clearer comparison and additional analyses of the tested start up operation and control strategies table 6 summarizes the results obtained using the different quantitative indicators the itae criterion an integral error criterion used in controller design or tuning gives an indication of the overall performance along the process operation duration in terms of the time weighted errors between the process outputs and the set points for the steady state offset errors as percentages reported in table 6 a zero or negative value for the s ac cv and a zero or positive value for the x ac or r ch4 cv corresponds to achievement of the corresponding set point at steady state in terms of achieving the nominal olr of 15 kgcod m3 d the manual strategy with 50 pab set sate for olr and the nmpc design without the methane production rate cv nmpc no rch4 was the fastest however the manual strategy with 50 pab set rate affects the ad performance output of the cvs when looking at the values of integral of the time weighted absolute error between set point and the cv itae criterion and the cv offset errors at steady state reported in table 6 comparing the itae and steady state offset values of the x ac and r ch4 cvs across the tested strategies the nmpc designs provide a significant advantage over the manual strategies in general also looking at fig 4 f both nmpc scenarios lead to faster start up of the process in comparison to the manual strategy in terms of the methane production output circa 39 days and 18 days for nmpc base and nmpcnorch4 respectively versus 70 75 days for the manual strategies with constant offset errors at steady state as seen in table 6 and achievement of nominal olr of 15 kgcod m3 d fig 4 g in terms of the fastest achievement of cvs toward the set points with minor offset error in s ac at steady state and the nominal olr the simpler nmpc design without targeting the methane production cv i e nmpc no rch4 appears to be the preferred choice for automatic and optimal ad start up management also successful onset of the process stable levels of cvs and ph is predicted after switching off the nmpc fig 4 d f and h alkali dosing in the long run could be later adjusted manually or by another control scheme however this falls outside the target of this work focused on start up alone the proposed nmpc system can however be redesigned for other operation targets via redefinition of the optimisation problem 3 5 robustness and performance analyses of the nmpc ad start up under different scenarios a number of practical case studies and scenarios were evaluated to assess the two nmpc designs nmpc base and nmpcno rch4 for robustness and possible improvements the details on these scenarios and the results obtained have been provided in appendix e of the supplementary material in brief the following cases were simulated 1 model sadm mismatch bias correction in which at each sampling event the differences between the plant outputs and sadm predictions are added as corrections to the sadm predictions for the next nmpc optimisation step 2 assumption of online x ac measurement availibility without any delays i e no x ac estimator in order to assess the impact of the state estimator 3 instrument error via random noise ranging between 10 and 10 change relative to actual measurements of the four sadm states and ch4 production rate 4 measured disturbances of substrate influent cod 2 tests 75 decrease and 75 increase in the base influent cod of 2 75 gcod l at 10th day for 15 days 5 unmeasured disturbances of substrate influent cod 4 tests 5 and 75 random changes in influent cod of 2 75gcod l 80 decrease and 80 increase in influent cod of 2 75gcod l at 10th day for 15 days the results figures and quantitative assessments for the above cases are provided in the appendix e of the supplementary material table e and figs e1 a to e5 h for the scenario involving model bias correction both nmpc designs yield faster performance with respect to switching to manual operation at constant nominal olr of 15 kgcod m3 d table e in appendix e compared to the results in table 6 however the nmpcbase design yields constant cv offset errors relative to set points table e and figs e1 a d f indicating that the set points for the x ac and ch4 production rate could not be reached at steady state the nmpcno rch4 yields a better performance according to the values of itae and cv set point offset errors table e and figs e1 b d f when compared to the results with nmpc base with the assumption of xac online measurement availability the nmpcbase design yields stable performance but is unable to drive the process towards the cv set points fig e2 a d f which was unexpected with the nmpc no rch4 design the start up performance table e and fig e2 b in appendix e is similar to that obtained under base scenario table 6 and fig 4 this indicates that the estimator works well without the availability of online measurement for x ac this is expected due to the previous good agreement between the estimator and the plant output for x ac fig d3 in appendix d of the supplementary material despite the instrument errors occurring throughout the process operation time both nmpc designs yield satisfactory results as the process is driven towards the cv set points without any failures table e and figs e3 a to e3 b in appendix e and without any oscillations in the optimal set of mvs implemented by the nmpc with measured disturbances of the influent cod of the substrate the nmpcbase design yields stable performance but with significant intermediate variations of cvs fig e4 a in appendix e for the disturbance involving reduction in influent cod however when subjected to disturbance involving increase in influent cod the start up performance is significantly poor with the nmpcbase design table e and fig e4 c d f in appendix e irrespective of the nature of disturbance the nmpcno rch4 yields stable performance while successfully meeting the cv set points at steady state but with oscillatory behavior and variations during start up figs e4 b and e4 d in appendix e also the time taken to switch to the nominal olr of 15kgcod m3 d and for conditions to stabilize around the set points is longer when the disturbance involves reduction in influent cod table e in appendix e under unmeasured disturbances in the influent cod i e the sadm is unaware of the changes in substrate influent cod concentration both nmpc designs are able to drive the process towards the set points without any stability issues however intermediate variations in cvs are observed in general figs e5 a to e5 h also nmpcno rch4 yields highly oscillatory behavior in some cases fig e5 h in appendix e in summary the nmpcno rch4 configuration appears to provide a more robust and superior performance compared to the nmpcbase alternative configuration against the different scenarios tested the nmpcbase fails to drive the process towards the set points for a number of the scenarios considered this indicates that the nmpc objective function formulation or in other words the process variables targeted for optimisation plays a key role in the level of success of the nmpc scheme for start up also these results could indicate that the unconventional method of starting with a high olr at the beginning of operation during start up according to nmpcbase design may not be an effective strategy despite its possible apparent optimality respect to the conventional approach of low to high olr 4 conclusion an nmpc system was developed to optimally start up high rate ad reactors consisting of a specifically designed objective function and a prediction model requiring only minimal practically feasible sets of measurements the nmpc evaluation on an adm1 based virtual plant start up for the case scenario of a high rate ad uasb reactor treating readily biodegradable substrate glucose produced positive results process stability stable levels of effluent acetate aceticlastic methanogens and methane production over time without any upsets and superior performance in terms of time required to reach methane production targets were obtained these results imply that an ad plant could be effectively started up with the proposed nmpc system using a minimal set of conventional measurements two very different start up feeding strategies were obtained from the two nmpc configurations proposed the nmpc configuration including methane production rate as an active objective function term delivers a very aggressive high to low olr feeding profile at high alkali cost the second alternative nmpc configuration without the methane production rate as target delivers a low to high more conventional olr feeding strategy at lower alkali cost and achieves the best performance in terms of start up time the prediction ad model sadm developed integral part of the nmpc system showed excellent agreement with the complex adm1 based virtual plant for some of the key ad process outputs based on a number of cases evaluated to assess the nmpc robustness and possible improvements the nmpc design without the ch4 production rate cv as term in the objective function nmpcno rch4 yielded superior performance compared to the nmpc base design this indicates that the variables targeted in the nmpc objective function for start up control play a key role in the efficiency and optimal management of the start up phase operation although the results obtained are very promising the developed nmpc system requires experimental validation in a real ad reactor further studies for controller parameter tuning as well as on the prediction model and impact of the weighting of the nmpc objective function terms are recommended a natural next step to build up on the start up strategy presented here is its further development towards an nmpc scheme for ad processes treating complex substrates and those with inhibitory components all these will contribute to fully evaluate the broader practical feasibility of the proposed nmpc control scheme for optimal automatic ad start up declaration of

18043,the catalytic hydrogel membrane reactor chmr is an interfacial membrane process that uses nano sized catalysts for the hydrogenation of oxidized contaminants in drinking water in this study the chmr was operated as a continuous flow reactor using nitrite no2 as a model contaminant and palladium pd as a model catalyst using the overall bulk reaction rate for no2 reduction as a metric for catalytic activity we evaluated the effect of the hydrogen gas h2 delivery method to the chmr the initial h2 and no2 concentrations pd density in the hydrogel and the presence of pd deactivating

vented operation mode where the reactor is sealed and the lumens are periodically flushed to the atmosphere allowed for a combination of a high h2 consumption efficiency and catalytic activity the overall reaction rate of no2 was dependent on relative concentrations of h2 and no2 at catalytic sites which was governed by both the chemical reaction and mass transport rates the intrinsic catalytic reaction rate was combined with a counter diffusional mass transport component in a 1 d computational model to describe the chmr common pd deactivating species sulfite bisulfide natural organic matter

dissolved in ultrapure water 18 2 mω cm a 25 cm length of the silicone hfm 0 037 od x 0 025 id 025bra002 braintree scientific saint gobain was completely submerged in the alginate solution in a custom

no3 2 2h2o 76070 sigma aldrich in aqueous solution which was then poured into a separate half tube reactor the alginate coated membrane was removed from the alginate solution and rapidly transferred to the ca2 pd2 cross linking solution for 30 min this procedure was repeated once to increase the hydrogel thickness and stability the embedded pd2 was reduced to pd nanoparticles by then submerging the coated hfms in 2 5 mm sodium borohydride nabh4 98 13432 alfa aesar to construct a multifiber chmr eight catalytic hydrogel membrane chm strands were inserted in a 25 cm long plastic tube with an inner diameter of 1 27 cm fig s1 plastic t connectors were installed on both ends of the tubing and the uncoated hfm ends of the chms were fixed in place with adhesive urethane 2rud4 grainger to create a water tight seal special care was taken to ensure the hfm openings were not crimped or sealed the pd mass in the chms and aqueous solution was quantified using acid microwave digestion and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy see si for further details marks et al 2019 2 2 continuous flow reactor configuration to conduct no2 hydrogenation experiments the chmr was configured as a continuous flow reactor with recycle fig 1 no2 was added to the influent reservoir 1000 ml at varying concentrations the reactor ph was buffered 5 8 6 3 by bubbling carbon dioxide co2 cd75 american gas and welding at 100 ml min and by addition of 10 mm sodium bicarbonate nahco3 acs grade 41900068 1 bio world into the influent reservoir to counteract the possibility of the na ions de linking the ca alginate hydrogel 1 4 mm calcium chloride cacl2 anhydrous c77 500 fisher scientific was also added the influent reservoir was fed to a reactor reservoir 120 ml by a peristaltic pump 3 ml min the reactor reservoir had two outlets the first outlet led to the chmr and this was recycled through the chmr and back into the reactor reservoir using a peristaltic pump 60 ml min liquid velocity 2 4 cm s 1 the flowrate was chosen to establish a recycle ratio of 20 so the overall behavior of the system was comparable to a completely stirred reactor the second outlet was the system effluent at water level and the flowrate matched the influent flowrate 3 ml min creating a hydraulic retention time in the combined chmr and reactor reservoir of 40 min unless otherwise noted all experiments were conducted in this reactor configuration reaction conditions for a typical experiment are listed in table s1 in all experiments the pumps were first turned on until the chmr volume was full and liquid was detected in the effluent then at t 0 hydrogenation the reaction was initiated by supplying h2 at 3 psig 1 22 bar to the chmr through the hfm lumen no2 and nh4 concentrations were measured in the effluent at regular intervals using ion chromatography ic dionex ics 5000 as 23 column cs 12a column 2 3 effect of the h2 delivery mode the effect of the h2 delivery mode on the no2 reduction activity and the h2 consumption efficiency was evaluated by running the chmr in closed open and vented modes a valve was installed at the end of the hfm to control the release of h2 to the atmosphere for all experiments 1 78 mm no2 nano2 reagent grade 0535 vwr was provided in the aqueous influent and 3 psig 1 22 bar of 100 h2 ultra high purity hy uhpt american gas and welding was supplied to the hfm lumen for open mode operation experiments were conducted with the valve open which allowed all h2 not diffusing through the hfm wall to exit to the atmosphere using a flow meter the h2 flowrate in open mode was measured to be approximately 4 l min 1 at 3 psig for closed mode operation the valve was closed to prevent the escape of h2 from the lumen end so h2 could only leave by diffusing through the hfm wall for the vented mode experiment the valve was opened every 15 min for 5 s 2 4 effect of reactant species concentrations the effect of no2 and h2 concentrations on the catalytic activity was investigated by varying the influent no2 concentrations 0 357 3 57 mm and the percent h2 5 100 pre mixed with n2 ultrahigh purity american gas and welding provided to the lumen during catalytic hydrogenation in open mode using the reactor configuration described previously all experiments were operated until steady state was achieved as confirmed by periodic measurement of no2 concentrations in the reactor effluent all equations used to calculate the no2 conversion and rate constants are provided in the si 2 5 effect of catalyst deactivating species so3 2 hs and nom were used to evaluate their effect on the no2 reduction activity caused by catalyst deactivation in each experiment the influent reservoir contained 1 78 mm nano2 10 mm nahco3 and 1 4 mm cacl2 the chmr was operated until steady state conditions were reached with respect to no2 reduction then the influent reservoir was spiked with one of the species causing deactivation 5 mg s l sodium sulfite nonahydrate na2so3 anhydrous aa65122 14 alfa aesar or 1 mg s l sodium sulfide na2s 9h2o 98 bj208043 fluka or 5 mg l suwanee river nom 2r101n international humic substances society the effect of the deactivating species was evaluated for up to 15 h by periodic sampling of no2 for subsequent ic analysis for the so3 2 and nom experiments co2 was bubbled in the influent reservoir to buffer the ph to

hydrogels by dissolving the ca alginate in a solution of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta 0 1 m and sodium citrate 0 2 m the particles were recovered by centrifugation with intermittent washing with ultrapure water n 3 for the batch experiments pd nanoparticles 1 13 and 4 87 mg were suspended in a 60 ml solution containing nano2 1 78 mm nahco3 10 mm and cacl2 1 4 mm co2 100 ml min and h2 150 ml min were bubbled continuously into the reactor pd masses similar to those used in the chmr experiments low and high loadings were used periodic aqueous samples were taken filtered and then the no2 and nh4 concentrations were analyzed using ic all batch experiments were repeated using 1 13 mg pd in the presence of the deactivating species i e section 2 5 same concentrations 2 7 effect of co ions on the stability of the hydrogel the stability of the ca alginate hydrogel in the presence of de linking ions h na was investigated by exposing ca alginate hydrogels to various aqueous conditions ca alginate hydrogels were grown on hfms as described previously and then submerged in vessels containing an aqueous solution of desired composition for 7 d no mixing was used so that only chemical stability changes were observed the changes in the concentrations of ca2 and pd in aqueous solution and the chm mass were used as metrics for evaluating the stability the change in the chm mass is reported as a mass ratio equal to the chm wet mass in ultrapure water at equilibrium divided by the chm wet mass after being exposed to selected aqueous conditions for 7 d the mass ratio indicates shrinking or swelling of the hydrogel structure due to changes in the total number of crosslinked sites the conditions evaluated in the 7 d experiments were 0 5 5 and 50 mm total concentration of either nacl cacl2 or nacl cacl2 10 1 4 m ratio additional hydrogel stability experiments were conducted by exposing the chm to a hard groundwater for 21 d and comparing the results to ultrapure water the groundwater characterization and full experimental details are given in the si 3 results discussion 3 1 effects of the hydrogen delivery mode on catalytic activity independent control of the h2 delivery into the lumen is a critical aspect of the chmr due to the influence of the h2 concentration on the catalytic activity and byproduct selectivity h2 delivery can be achieved through different modes that will influence the h2 concentration in the catalytic hydrogel and h2 consumption efficiency in closed mode the hfm is sealed at the end and all h2 that enters can only leave by diffusion through the hfm wall h2 consumption efficiencies in this mode approach 100 since all h2 must pass into the catalytic hydrogel where reaction occurs ahmed et al 2004 martin and nerenberg 2012 pankhania et al 1994 perez calleja et al 2017 the drawback to closed mode is back diffusion of non reactive gases i e co2 n2 from the aqueous phase into the sealed membrane back diffusion results in an h2 gradient along the lumen length i e lower h2 at one end and therefore in the hydrogel which lowers the catalytic activity of the chmr in open mode the hfm is open at the end and all the h2 that does not diffuse through the hfm wall exits the hfm into the atmosphere this mode is used to prevent formation of the unwanted h2 gradients and it improves catalytic activity but causes a low h2 consumption efficiency the final option is a mixture of closed and open modes called vented mode which is a strategy initially developed for membrane biofilm reactors perez calleja et al 2017 for vented mode the hfm is set up similar to closed mode but a valve is placed at the end of the hfm to allow it to be opened at regular intervals to flush out the inert gases this mode maintains a consistent h2 partial pressure throughout the hfm while ensuring good h2 consumption efficiency in this study a conservative vent cycle of 15 min closed followed by 5 s open was selected to maximize activity limit h2 gradient formation in the lumen and allow pseudo steady state conditions to develop in the chmr the results of the no2 hydrogenation experiments operated in open closed and vented modes in shown in fig 2 at the beginning of hydrogenation the effluent no2 concentration is equal to the influent concentration and the effluent concentration continuously decreases until steady state is achieved steady state conditions were reached within 2 5 h for all operation modes the average no2 conversion at steady state for open closed and vented modes was 64 5 0 6 4 0 0 4 and 56 8 1 1 respectively in closed mode the no2 conversion was greatest at the first time point as the h2 inert gas gradient had not yet fully developed as the reaction proceeded the conversion decreased as the gradient in the lumen fully developed stabilizing within 2 h conversions were comparable between open and vented modes suggesting their h2 concentrations were similar in the catalytic hydrogel the standard deviation of the average conversion was higher in vented mode compared to open and closed modes due to the repeated development of transient h2 gradients during the 15 min periods between venting which prevented a true steady state from occurring the h2 consumption efficiency can be determined by evaluating the ratio of h2 consumed by reaction with no2 to the total volume released from the supplying tank during the reaction period calculations in si during a 1 hr steady state period approximately 0 039 0 62 and 0 54 mmol of h2 were consumed by the reaction in closed open and vented modes respectively in closed mode the h2 consumption efficiency approached 100 because all h2 was assumed to leave the lumen only by diffusion in open mode most of the h2 was released to the atmosphere 9809 mmol h so a low consumption efficiency of 0 0064 was observed in vented mode 54 4 mmol of h2 exited the lumen during the four open venting cycles per hour resulting in an h2 consumption efficiency of approximately 1 0 while this efficiency is still low compared to closed mode the no2 removal was much higher providing an excellent compromise between catalytic performance and h2 consumption efficiency operation of the chmr in vented mode can be improved with an optimized venting scheme i e reduce vent time that minimizes h2 gradient formation and loss of h2 through the lumen end as well as improving the h2 consumption efficiency all further experiments in this study were conducted in open mode to simplify reactor conditions and remove extraneous processes e g formation of h2 gradients 3 2 effects of the reactive species concentration on no2 hydrogenation evaluating the effect of the influent concentration of the reactive species i e h2 no2 on the reaction rate is critical for understanding the limiting reactions of the chmr a batch experiment using suspended catalysts was first run to determine the reaction rate on the catalyst without interference from mass transport limitations these kinetic results confirmed that no2 reduction followed pseudo first order behavior on pd fig s2 continuous flow chmr experiments were then conducted in open mode using a range of influent no2 0 357 3 57 mm and h2 concentrations 5 100 in n2 two pd loadings low 2 26 mg high 9 70 mg were selected to evaluate the effect of the number of active sites on the reaction rate fig 3 a and b present the reaction rate r for a range of h2 concentrations as a function of effluent no2 concentrations i e steady state for the high and low pd loadings respectively r is the reaction rate normalized to pd molarity i e mol n mol pd 1 s 1 and is obtained from the from the steady state continuous flow experiments table s2 for all conditions r increased with increasing h2 and no2 concentrations and r for the low pd loading was higher at all conditions compared to the high pd loading because the curve slopes were not linear and different rates were observed for the h2 variations under otherwise similar conditions the overall reaction rate was not strictly first order and the rate was be dependent on the number of active pd sites the concentration of h2 and the no2 concentration fig 3c and d present pd normalized no2 conversion for a range of h2 concentrations as a function of effluent no2 concentrations for the high and low loadings respectively similar to trends observed for r i e fig 3a and b a higher influent h2 concentration and a lower pd loading achieved the greatest the pd normalized no2 conversion but an opposite trend was observed for the steady state no2 concentration increasing the influent no2 concentration generally decreased the no2 conversion except for the 25 50 and 100 h2 conditions of the low loading where the conversion initially increased and then decreased with increasing no2 concentration this observation in conjunction with the slope of the reaction rate curves indicates that the reaction order shifts between zero and first order heterogeneous catalysis reactions are typically described by langmuir hinshelwood kinetics chaplin et al 2006 jani et al 2012 pintar et al 1996 1998 however due to the mass transfer effect imparted by the hydrogel this model does not appropriately describe the observed reaction rate of the chmr this was evident when comparing the observed reaction rate r i e without pd normalization table s2 to the r values of the high fig 3a and low pd fig 3b loading results the observed reaction rate was greater for the high pd loading compared to the low loading but because the low loading had a higher r this indicates that it had a wider reactive zone that used a larger percent of the pd as discussed previously marks et al 2019 to evaluate the effect of diffusion limitations within the chmr the pd normalized first order rate constant k 1 of the batch fig s2 and chmr experiments were used to calculate the activity ratio the activity ratio is a measure activity loss in the chmr due to mass transfer limitations calculated by dividing k chmr by k batch the k 1 for the low and high pd loadings of the chmr were 1 32 and 0 667 l mol pd 1 s 1 respectively in the batch system the k 1 for equivalent low and high loadings were 1 40 and 1 08 mol pd 1 s 1 respectively the corresponding activity ratios for the low and high pd loadings were 0 94 and 0 62 respectively this correlation confirms the role of mass transport in limiting the reaction rates especially in the case of the high loading where the reactive zone was small and confined near the bulk solution this finding was consistent with observations in our previous study marks et al 2019 where more densely loaded chms had a lower activity ratio due to slow diffusive transport of no2 to active pd sites deep within the hydrogel while a first order rate constant does not accurately reflect the overall reaction rate behavior for the range of conditions tested in this study a maximum k 1 was calculated to allow for general comparisons across other studies that report k 1 i e tables s2 and s3 bertoch et al 2017 espinosa et al 2018 holler et al 2001 jarrah 2018 a k of 1 87 l mol pd 1 s 1 was calculated for the low pd loading at an h2 partial pressure of 1 22 bar i e 100 and an influent no2 concentration of 0 71 mm which is approximately two orders of magnitude greater than the rate constants reported in our previous study on the chmr that used closed mode and no co2 buffer attesting to their operational importance marks et al 2019 though the byproduct selectivity was not a focus of this study nh4 concentrations were measured to provide insight into the effect of initial h2 and no2 concentrations generally the nh4 selectivity table s2 fig 4 decreased as the h n ratio decreased and remained below 5 under high influent no2 concentrations consistent with previous results marks et al 2019 postma et al 2018 zhao et al 2016 this result attests to the ability of the chmr to easily alter the byproduct selectivity by adjusting the h2 partial pressure 3 3 evaluating effects of diffusion limitations using a 1 d computational model no2 hydrogenation at pd sites has been shown to best fit the hinshelwood steady state adsorption ssa kinetic model proposed hinshelwood 1940 pintar et al 1998 shelstad et al 1960 wherein h2 adsorbs and dissociates on the pd surface before reacting with aqueous no2 in the outer helmholtz plane to form either nh4 or n2 in this study the proposed causative factor for activity loss with increasing no2 concentrations is from transport limitations of no2 within the catalytic hydrogel to account for the mass transport limitations in the overall reaction rate a 1 d model was created using the aquasim simulation program based on membrane biofilm reactors martin et al 2013 and incorporating the hinshelwood ssa kinetic model for the intrinsic no2 reaction rate the model was used to conceptualize the concentration profiles of no2 and h2 within the hydrogel when supplied with influent no2 concentrations and h2 partial pressure in the lumen the model predicts no2 removal at steady state and the concentration profiles of reactive species within the hydrogel the location and thickness of the reactive zone rz region of the catalytic hydrogel where h2 and no2 interact at active catalyst active sites can be estimated using the model and related to observed reaction kinetics the model considers diffusion of h2 from the lumen through the hfm wall and into the hydrogel diffusion of no2 from the bulk aqueous zone through the stagnant ldl and into the hydrogel and the catalytic reaction of no2 and h2 in the rz the modeled reactor configuration hydraulic retention time reactor volume hydrogel properties etc table s1 was taken from this study and the chemical and physical parameters reaction kinetic model and diffusion coefficients were taken from previous studies martin et al 2015 pintar et al 1998 this simplified model describes the effect of only h2 and no2 concentrations and is used herein only as a conceptual tool to elucidate the observed experimental results details on the model configuration and descriptive equations can be found in the si fig 5 shows the model output of the concentration profiles of no2 and h2 at steady state conditions h2 diffuses from the hfm wall into the hydrogel where a concentration profile develops that is dependent on both diffusive transport and catalytic reaction a similar but counter diffusional profile develops for no2 as it diffuses from the bulk through the ldl and into the hydrogel where it is also subject to both reaction and diffusion processes as the h2 partial pressure in the lumen increases with a constant influent no2 concentration the concentration profile shape of both no2 and h2 within the hydrogel change fig 5a at the lowest h2 partial pressures h2 is rapidly consumed by reaction as it leaves the hfm wall and travels into the hydrogel the rz gray region is made up of only a small fraction of the portion of the hydrogel nearest the hfm wall no2 fully penetrates the hydrogel and the no2 concentration within the hydrogel is relatively constant suggesting low catalytic reaction rates and confirms the low no2 removal rates observed experimentally as h2 concentrations increase h2 penetrates deeper into the hydrogel towards the bulk before it is completely consumed by reaction with no2 the increased presence of h2 throughout the membrane generates a quicker reaction rate causing an increase in the no2 concentration gradient as no2 is more rapidly consumed further the rz expands and shifts towards the hydrogel exterior as the h2 partial pressure increases decreasing the average diffusive transport distance for no2 before reaction at the highest h2 concentrations the diffusive transport distance for no2 to enter the rz is minimized and no2 reaction rates are maximized the observed concentration profile changes with increasing reactive species concentrations correlate well with the shifts in experimentally measured r with changes in reactive species concentration when no2 influent concentrations are increased at constant h2 pressure concentration profiles shift in a corresponding manner fig 5b at the lowest no2 concentration all no2 is consumed in a shallow rz near the hydrogel edge as h2 diffuses across much of the hydrogel towards the bulk before reaching no2 species increasing the no2 concentration causes the rz to move deeper into the hydrogel as no2 diffuses further before being consumed by reaction finally at the highest no2 concentration no2 penetrates the entirety of the catalytic hydrogel without being fully consumed while all h2 is consumed rapidly near the hfm wall as no2 concentrations increase the diffusive transport distance of no2 through the hydrogel to the rz increases diffusive mass transport limitations become progressively more influential on overall kinetics as insufficient h2 is delivered to the catalytic hydrogel through the lumen wall to fully reduce no2 and removal rates no longer increase with increased no2 concentrations this trend corresponds well with the experimental results observed in fig 3 where increases in the no2 influent concentration increases r until a limit is reached that is dependent on the h2 confirming the role of diffusive transport on limiting the observed reaction rates the 1 d model is useful for describing the behavior of the chmr continuing work should focus on calibrating the model with experimental data so that it can be used to identify key factors impacting the behavior of the chmr e g flux including hydrogel catalyst density h2 supply pressure influent and bulk no2 concentrations and hydrogel thickness 3 4 effects of select co occurring species on the catalytic activity one of the major challenges for catalytic hydrogenation is deactivation of the catalyst by other species in real waters our previous work showed that catalytic deactivation was minimal over a 3 day reaction period in a hard groundwater containing a relatively high so4 2 concentration suggesting that the catalytic hydrogel may limit deactivation marks et al 2019 to investigate the effects of known pd deactivating species on the catalytic activity of the chmr experiments were conducted in the presence of so3 2 hs and nom for at least 12 h fig 6 the addition of so3 2 5 mg s l resulted in a steady loss of conversion from 61 5 to 50 9 indicating deactivation of the catalyst fig 6a a similar behavior was observed when hs 1 mg s l was spiked into the reactor in a separate experiment fig 6b the initial steady state conversion was lower than the other species because co2 was not used to prevent the formation of h2s at acidic ph conversion in the absence of hs and co2 was 21 8 and this steadily decreased to 2 5 after hs was spiked into the reactor fig 6b indicating deactivation had occurred for nom 5 mg l a different trend was observed compared to the other species initially after adding nom the conversion dropped from 60 3 to 46 8 after 2 5 h but the conversion returned to 58 4 after an additional 12 h of exposure fig 6c this behavior suggests that the deactivating effects of nom in the chmr were temporary the effect of these species on the catalytic activity of pd is supported by previous results chaplin et al 2006 but these results provide evidence that some protection from deactivation is provided by the hydrogel especially in the case of nom to determine the role of the hydrogel the effect of these deactivating species on the intrinsic catalytic activity of the pd nanoparticles in the absence of a hydrogel was evaluated using suspended batch reactor experiments fig s3a in the absence of deactivating species the k was l mol pd 1 s 1 and this decreased to 0 648 and 0 299 l mol pd 1 s 1 in the presence of so3 2 and nom respectively when hs was present no no2 removal was observed suggesting that hs had severely deactivated the catalyst however poor removal was observed even when no hs was present fig s3b due to the high ph phfinal 9 5 when no co2 was used these results are consistent with previous studies evaluating the effects of these deactivating species on pd catalysts chaplin et al 2006 seraj et al 2017 xiao et al 1992 pd deactivation by sulfur compounds remains a challenge but regeneration of the catalyst is a feasible approach chaplin et al 2009 the cause of the reduced deactivation effect of nom using the chmr is less clear batch experiments with suspended particles showed that nom deactivated pd somewhat but it was lower in the chmr this result suggests that the hydrogel prevented nom pd interactions which may be related to the poor transport of the nom through the hydrogel 3 5 hydrogel stability as a function of aqueous conditions the long term stability of the ca alginate hydrogel is a critical challenge to implementation of chmrs for treatment of drinking water fig 7 shows the stability of hydrogels coated on hfms or a range of aqueous conditions relevant to water treatment the effect of ph on stability of ca alginate hydrogels no pd was evaluated between neutral and acidic ph fig 7a below ph 4 ca2 was released from the hydrogel consistent with the protonation of guluronic pka 3 65 and mannuronic pka 3 38 acid moieties of alginate and the transition of the ca alginate to alginic acid chuang et al 2017 the expulsion of ca2 from the hydrogel crosslink sites caused the gel to shift from transparent to opaque as the chemical structure transitions from ionically bound ca alginate to alginic acid gel stabilized by hydrogen bonding draget et al 2006 this transition hampered attempts to investigate catalytic function at acidic ph because the resulting alginic acid gel degraded rapidly due to mixing shear forces thus limiting the aqueous ph above the pka of alginic functional groups is critical to long term stability and catalytic performance of ca alginate based chmr operation at ph 5 8 6 3 as conducted in this study provided an optimal catalytic activity while preventing instability of the ca alginate hydrogel ionic exchange of monovalent cations e g na with ca2 at crosslink sites can eliminate connections between polymer strands and break down the 3d structure of the hydrogel loureiro dos santos 2017 to investigate the effects of monovalent cations on the hydrogel stability and behavior the mass ratio of chms was measured after exposure to solutions of increasing total concentrations of either na only ca2 only or a mixture of na and ca2 fig 7b when only na was present the hydrogel swelled proportionally to the concentration of na indicating a loss of ca alginate crosslinked sites as na exchanged with ca2 the addition of ca2 to the aqueous phase prevented swelling of the hydrogel which was attributed to the affinity of alginate sites for the ca2 idota et al 2016 when both na and ca2 were present at a total concentration of 50 mm 43 8 mm na 6 14 mm ca2 10 1 4 m ratio the hydrogel shrank due to crosslinking of new sites from the additional ca2 matyash et al 2014 these sites were likely initially filled by pd2 species prior to reduction to pd0 thus leaving them open indeed when no na was present hydrogel shrinking was observed even at low ca2 concentrations e g 0 5 mm overall the mass ratio results showed that hydrogel swelling was dependent on the concentration and valence of cations in the aqueous phase shrinking and or swelling of the hydrogel influences the overall catalytic performance of the chmr for example shrinking results in an increased hydrogel density and a smaller pore network that will decrease the diffusivity of aqueous species favre et al 2001 pasut et al 2008 this shrinkage could negatively influence the mass transport and thus the overall reaction rate though shrinking will also result in a decreased hydrogel thickness which would improve the mass transport of the system i e fig 5 the two phenomena work against each other and presumably small changes in the hydrogel mass ratio either due to shrinking or swelling will not significantly affect the reaction rate to investigate the changes in hydrogel swelling under relevant aqueous conditions the mass ratio of hydrogels was measured over 21 d in an ultrapure water or a groundwater fig 7c no significant hydrogel shrink swell 6 mass ratio change was observed over this period in either matrix suggesting that hydrogel structural changes were minimal the na ca2 molar ratio 10 6 1 4 4 mm na 2 7 mm ca2 and total na ca2 concentration 7 1 mm of the groundwater table s5 were similar to those for the model na ca2 mixture at 5 mm 4 4 mm na 0 61 mm ca2 a comparable shrinking behavior between the two was observed with mass ratios of 0 94 and 0 87 respectively the groundwater also contained 1 25 mm mg2 which may have contributed to the crosslinking although the affinity of alginate cross link sites for mg2 is lower than ca2 idota et al 2016 the tendency of pd nanoparticles to leach from the catalytic hydrogel during the stability experiments was investigated by measuring pd concentrations in the aqueous phase after the soaking period pd was only detected in the aqueous phase when concentrations of na greater than 50 mm were used after exposure to a 50 mm na solution only 2 5 μg 0 29 of the total pd present in the hydrogel was detected in the aqueous phase pd leaching is attributed to de linking and swelling of hydrogel structure when major hydrogel swelling was avoided no detectable pd leaching was observed these results show that groundwaters are excellent candidates for the chmr due to the presence of divalent cations that reduce hydrogel swelling source waters with high concentrations of monovalent cations and low concentrations of divalent cations e g some surface waters may need pretreatment addition of ca2 salts before the chmr due to the expansion and degradation of the ca alginate hydrogel 4 conclusions the chmr is an effective system for immobilizing nano sized catalysts to be used for the hydrogenation of oxidized contaminants pd and no2 were used as models in this study because the synthesis of pd and the hydrogenation pathway of no2 are relatively straightforward this simplicity allowed for key factors affecting the chmr performance e g influent reactant concentrations to be evaluated without unnecessary complications e g unknown intermediate reactions the chmr is adaptable to other catalysts and contaminants for contaminants that are treatable using pd e g trichloroethylene lowry and reinhard 2000 no changes to the catalytic hydrogel synthesis process would be required for contaminants that require alternative or more intricate catalysts changes to the synthesis process could be easily implemented for example hydrogenation of nitrate no3 an important drinking water contaminant requires a more complex bimetallic catalyst such as pd in chaplin et al 2012 guo et al 2018 the pd catalyst used herein could be replaced with the pd in catalyst by adding a step in the catalytic hydrogel synthesis process to cover pd with in or the pd in catalysts could be synthesized ex situ and then incorporated during the hydrogel crosslinking step similarly an re pd catalyst could be used to reduce perchlorate clo4 liu et al 2013 for all hydrogenation catalyst and contaminant scenarios the reactivity will be affected similarly by the diffusion reaction processes observed in this study while the optimal operating conditions will change for each scenario the important parameters controlling the overall rate that were explored herein e g influent contaminant concentration h2 supply pressure catalyst density will be universal due to diffusion the steady state concentrations of h2 and no2 will decrease with increasing distance from the bulk source and thus the reaction rate at catalyst sites varies within the hydrogel this affects the width of the reaction zone and highlights the need to optimize the catalytic hydrogel thickness the 1 d model usedd herein for the chmr is useful for predicting reaction profiles in the catalytic hydrogel and tuning its parameters the needs to be calibrated using experimental data and expanded to evaluate important operating parameters such as flux while the hydrogel afforded some protection from the catalyst deactivating species tested especially larger molecules like dom smaller species remain a problem future studies are needed to better understand the molecular scale interactions between pd and naturally occurring deactivating species these results could be used to engineer pd catalysts more resistant to deactivation operationally the h2 usage efficiency can be optimized using a venting strategy and the number of fibers can be increased to treat a wide range of flows and concentrations furthermore the chmr can use existing infrastructure designed for hfm membrane biofilm reactors the use of h2 as a reductant may contribute to biofilm grown on the catalytic hydrogel but this can be mitigated by controlling the h2 concentration so that it is zero at the bulk water interface no biofilm growth was observed in this or previous studies marks et al 2019 but this result should be confirmed under more conditions and

18043,the catalytic hydrogel membrane reactor chmr is an interfacial membrane process that uses nano sized catalysts for the hydrogenation of oxidized contaminants in drinking water in this study the chmr was operated as a continuous flow reactor using nitrite no2 as a model contaminant and palladium pd as a model catalyst using the overall bulk reaction rate for no2 reduction as a metric for catalytic activity we evaluated the effect of the hydrogen gas h2 delivery method to the chmr the initial h2 and no2 concentrations pd density in the hydrogel and the presence of pd deactivating species the chemical stability of the catalytic hydrogel was evaluated in the presence of aqueous cations h na ca2 and a mixture of ions in a hard groundwater delivering h2 to the chmr lumens using a vented operation mode where the reactor is sealed and the lumens are periodically flushed to the atmosphere allowed for a combination of a high h2 consumption efficiency and catalytic activity the overall reaction rate of no2 was dependent on relative concentrations of h2 and no2 at catalytic sites which was governed by both the chemical reaction and mass transport rates the intrinsic catalytic reaction rate was combined with a counter diffusional mass transport component in a 1 d computational model to describe the chmr common pd deactivating species sulfite bisulfide natural organic matter

catalytic hydrogel membrane reactor chmr marks et al 2019 the chmr consists of a central gas permeable tubular hollow fiber membrane hfm that is coated with a hydrogel that immobilizes catalyst nanoparticles the hydrogel matrix offers excellent diffusivity of aqueous species to minimize diffusive transport limitations puguan et al 2015 the reductant h2 is supplied through the hfm interior i

that rely on bubbling h2 into the aqueous phase e g packed bed reactors once saturation is reached increasing the flow rate will not affect the reaction rate in contrast for the chmr the reaction rate is controlled by the h2 pressure in the lumen because this pressure controls the amount of available h2 at catalytic sites dittmeyer et al 2001 espinosa et al 2016 2018 the molar ratio of h to aqueous

velocity 2 4 cm s 1 the flowrate was chosen to establish a recycle ratio of 20 so the overall behavior of the system was comparable to a completely stirred reactor the second outlet was the system effluent at water level and the flowrate matched the influent flowrate 3 ml min creating a hydraulic retention time in the combined chmr and reactor reservoir of 40 min unless otherwise noted all experiments were conducted in this reactor configuration reaction conditions for a typical experiment are listed in table s1 in all experiments the pumps were first turned on until the chmr volume was full and liquid was detected in the effluent then at t 0 hydrogenation the reaction was initiated by supplying h2 at 3 psig 1 22 bar to the chmr through the hfm lumen no2 and nh4 concentrations were measured in the effluent at regular intervals using ion chromatography ic dionex ics 5000 as 23 column cs 12a column 2 3 effect of the h2 delivery mode the effect of the h2 delivery mode on the no2 reduction activity and the h2 consumption efficiency was evaluated by running the chmr in closed open and vented modes a valve was installed at the end of the hfm to control the release of h2 to the

supplied to the hfm lumen for open mode operation experiments were conducted with the valve open which allowed all h2 not diffusing through the hfm wall to exit to the atmosphere using a flow meter the h2 flowrate in open mode was measured to be approximately 4 l min 1 at 3 psig for closed mode operation the valve was closed to prevent the escape of h2 from the lumen end so h2 could only leave by diffusing through the hfm wall for the vented mode experiment the valve was opened every 15 min for 5 s 2 4 effect of reactant species concentrations the effect of no2 and h2 concentrations on the

ml min were bubbled continuously into the reactor pd masses similar to those used in the chmr experiments low and high loadings were used periodic aqueous samples were taken filtered and then the no2 and nh4 concentrations were analyzed using ic all batch experiments were repeated using 1 13 mg pd in the presence of the deactivating species i e section 2 5 same concentrations 2 7 effect of co ions on the stability of the hydrogel the stability of the ca alginate hydrogel in the presence of de linking ions h na was investigated by exposing ca alginate hydrogels to various aqueous conditions ca alginate hydrogels were grown on hfms as described previously and then submerged in vessels containing an aqueous solution of desired composition for 7 d no mixing was used so that only chemical stability changes were observed the changes in the concentrations of ca2 and pd in aqueous solution and the chm mass were used as metrics for evaluating the stability the change in the chm mass is reported as a mass ratio equal to the chm wet mass in ultrapure water at equilibrium divided by the chm wet mass after being exposed to selected aqueous conditions for 7 d the mass ratio indicates shrinking or swelling of the hydrogel structure due to changes in the total number of crosslinked sites the conditions evaluated in the 7 d experiments were 0 5 5 and 50 mm total concentration of either nacl cacl2 or nacl cacl2 10 1 4 m ratio additional hydrogel stability experiments were conducted by exposing the chm to a hard groundwater for 21 d and comparing the results to ultrapure water the groundwater characterization and full experimental details are given in the si 3 results discussion 3 1 effects of the hydrogen delivery mode on catalytic activity independent control of the h2 delivery into the lumen is a critical aspect of the chmr due to the influence of the h2 concentration on the catalytic activity and byproduct selectivity h2 delivery can be achieved through different modes that will influence the h2 concentration in the catalytic hydrogel and h2 consumption efficiency in closed mode the hfm is sealed at the end and all h2 that enters can only leave by diffusion through the hfm wall h2 consumption efficiencies in this mode approach 100 since all h2 must pass into the catalytic hydrogel where reaction occurs ahmed et al 2004 martin and nerenberg 2012 pankhania et al 1994 perez calleja et al 2017 the drawback to closed mode is back diffusion of non reactive gases i e co2 n2 from the aqueous phase into the sealed membrane back diffusion results in an h2 gradient along the lumen length i e lower h2 at one end and therefore in the hydrogel which lowers the catalytic activity of the chmr in open mode the hfm is open at the end and all the h2 that does not diffuse through the hfm wall exits the hfm into the atmosphere this mode is used to prevent formation of the unwanted h2 gradients and it improves catalytic activity but causes a low h2 consumption efficiency the final option is a mixture of closed and open modes called vented mode which is a strategy initially developed for membrane biofilm reactors perez calleja et al 2017 for vented mode the hfm is set up similar to closed mode but a valve is placed at the end of the hfm to allow it to be opened at regular intervals to flush out the inert gases this mode maintains a consistent h2 partial pressure throughout the hfm while ensuring good h2 consumption efficiency in this study a conservative vent cycle of 15 min closed followed by 5 s open was selected to maximize activity limit h2 gradient formation in the lumen and allow pseudo steady state conditions to develop in the chmr the results of the no2 hydrogenation experiments operated in open closed and vented modes in shown in fig 2 at the beginning of hydrogenation the effluent no2 concentration is equal to the influent concentration and the effluent concentration continuously decreases until steady state is achieved steady state conditions were reached within 2 5 h for all operation modes the average no2 conversion at steady state for open closed and vented modes was 64 5 0 6 4 0 0 4 and 56 8 1 1 respectively in closed mode the no2 conversion was greatest at the first time point as the h2 inert gas gradient had not yet fully developed as the reaction proceeded the conversion decreased as the gradient in the lumen fully developed stabilizing within 2 h conversions were comparable between open and vented modes suggesting their h2 concentrations were similar in the catalytic hydrogel the standard deviation of the average conversion was higher in vented mode compared to open and closed modes due to the repeated development of transient h2 gradients during the 15 min periods between venting which prevented a true steady state from occurring the h2 consumption efficiency can be determined by evaluating the ratio of h2 consumed by reaction with no2 to the total volume released from the supplying tank during the reaction period calculations in si during a 1 hr steady state period approximately 0 039 0 62 and 0 54 mmol of h2 were consumed by the reaction in closed open and vented modes respectively in closed mode the h2 consumption efficiency approached 100 because all h2 was assumed to leave the lumen only by diffusion in open mode most of the h2 was released to the atmosphere 9809 mmol h so a low consumption efficiency of 0 0064 was observed in vented mode 54 4 mmol of h2 exited the lumen during the four open venting cycles per hour resulting in an h2 consumption efficiency of approximately 1 0 while this efficiency is still low compared to closed mode the no2 removal was much higher providing an excellent compromise between catalytic performance and h2 consumption efficiency operation of the chmr in vented mode can be improved with an optimized venting scheme i e reduce vent time that minimizes h2 gradient formation and loss of h2 through the lumen end as well as improving the h2 consumption efficiency all further experiments in this study were conducted in open mode to simplify reactor conditions and remove extraneous processes e g formation of h2 gradients 3 2 effects of the reactive species concentration on no2 hydrogenation evaluating the effect of the influent concentration of the reactive species i e h2 no2 on the reaction rate is critical for understanding the limiting reactions of the chmr a batch experiment using suspended catalysts was first run to determine the reaction rate on the catalyst without interference from mass transport limitations these kinetic results confirmed that no2 reduction followed pseudo first order behavior on pd fig s2 continuous flow chmr experiments were then conducted in open mode using a range of influent no2 0 357 3 57 mm and h2 concentrations 5 100 in n2 two pd loadings low 2 26 mg high 9 70 mg were selected to evaluate the effect of the number of active sites on the reaction rate fig 3 a and b present the reaction rate r for a range of h2 concentrations as a function of effluent no2 concentrations i e steady state for the high and low pd loadings respectively r is the reaction rate normalized to pd molarity i e mol n mol pd 1 s 1 and is obtained from the from the steady state continuous flow experiments table s2 for all conditions r increased with increasing h2 and no2 concentrations and r for the low pd loading was higher at all conditions compared to the high pd loading because the curve slopes were not linear and different rates were observed for the h2 variations under otherwise similar conditions the overall reaction rate was not strictly first order and the rate was be dependent on the number of active pd sites the concentration of h2 and the no2 concentration fig 3c and d present pd normalized no2 conversion for a range of h2 concentrations as a function of effluent no2 concentrations for the high and low loadings respectively similar to trends observed for r i e fig 3a and b a higher influent h2 concentration and a lower pd loading achieved the greatest the pd normalized no2 conversion but an opposite trend was observed for the steady state no2 concentration increasing the influent no2 concentration generally decreased the no2 conversion except for the 25 50 and 100 h2 conditions of the low loading where the conversion initially increased and then decreased with increasing no2 concentration this observation in conjunction with the slope of the reaction rate curves indicates that the reaction order shifts between zero and first order heterogeneous catalysis reactions are typically described by langmuir hinshelwood kinetics chaplin et al 2006 jani et al 2012 pintar et al 1996 1998 however due to the mass transfer effect imparted by the hydrogel this model does not appropriately describe the observed reaction rate of the chmr this was evident when comparing the observed reaction rate r i e without pd normalization table s2 to the r values of the high fig 3a and low pd fig 3b loading results the observed reaction rate was greater for the high pd loading compared to the low loading but because the low loading had a higher r this indicates that it had a wider reactive zone that used a larger percent of the pd as discussed previously marks et al 2019 to evaluate the effect of diffusion limitations within the chmr the pd normalized first order rate constant k 1 of the batch fig s2 and chmr experiments were used to calculate the activity ratio the activity ratio is a measure activity loss in the chmr due to mass transfer limitations calculated by dividing k chmr by k batch the k 1 for the low and high pd loadings of the chmr were 1 32 and 0 667 l mol pd 1 s 1 respectively in the batch system the k 1 for equivalent low and high loadings were 1 40 and 1 08 mol pd 1 s 1 respectively the corresponding activity ratios for the low and high pd loadings were 0 94 and 0 62 respectively this correlation confirms the role of mass transport in limiting the reaction rates especially in the case of the high loading where the reactive zone was small and confined near the bulk solution this finding was consistent with observations in our previous study marks et al 2019 where more densely loaded chms had a lower activity ratio due to slow diffusive transport of no2 to active pd sites deep within the hydrogel while a first order rate constant does not accurately reflect the overall reaction rate behavior for the range of conditions tested in this study a maximum k 1 was calculated to allow for general comparisons across other studies that report k 1 i e tables s2 and s3 bertoch et al 2017 espinosa et al 2018 holler et al 2001 jarrah 2018 a k of 1 87 l mol pd 1 s 1 was calculated for the low pd loading at an h2 partial pressure of 1 22 bar i e 100 and an influent no2 concentration of 0 71 mm which is approximately two orders of magnitude greater than the rate constants reported in our previous study on the chmr that used closed mode and no co2 buffer attesting to their operational importance marks et al 2019 though the byproduct selectivity was not a focus of this study nh4 concentrations were measured to provide insight into the effect of initial h2 and no2 concentrations generally the nh4 selectivity table s2 fig 4 decreased as the h n ratio decreased and remained below 5 under high influent no2 concentrations consistent with previous results marks et al 2019 postma et al 2018 zhao et al 2016 this result attests to the ability of the chmr to easily alter the byproduct selectivity by adjusting the h2 partial pressure 3 3 evaluating effects of diffusion limitations using a 1 d computational model no2 hydrogenation at pd sites has been shown to best fit the hinshelwood steady state adsorption ssa kinetic model proposed hinshelwood 1940 pintar et al 1998 shelstad et al 1960 wherein h2 adsorbs and dissociates on the pd surface before reacting with aqueous no2 in the outer helmholtz plane to form either nh4 or n2 in this study the proposed causative factor for activity loss with increasing no2 concentrations is from transport limitations of no2 within the catalytic hydrogel to account for the mass transport limitations in the overall reaction rate a 1 d model was created using the aquasim simulation program based on membrane biofilm reactors martin et al 2013 and incorporating the hinshelwood ssa kinetic model for the intrinsic no2 reaction rate the model was used to conceptualize the concentration profiles of no2 and h2 within the hydrogel when supplied with influent no2 concentrations and h2 partial pressure in the lumen the model predicts no2 removal at steady state and the concentration profiles of reactive species within the hydrogel the location and thickness of the reactive zone rz region of the catalytic hydrogel where h2 and no2 interact at active catalyst active sites can be estimated using the model and related to observed reaction kinetics the model considers diffusion of h2 from the lumen through the hfm wall and into the hydrogel diffusion of no2 from the bulk aqueous zone through the stagnant ldl and into the hydrogel and the catalytic reaction of no2 and h2 in the rz the modeled reactor configuration hydraulic retention time reactor volume hydrogel properties etc table s1 was taken from this study and the chemical and physical parameters reaction kinetic model and diffusion coefficients were taken from previous studies martin et al 2015 pintar et al 1998 this simplified model describes the effect of only h2 and no2 concentrations and is used herein only as a conceptual tool to elucidate the observed experimental results details on the model configuration and descriptive equations can be found in the si fig 5 shows the model output of the concentration profiles of no2 and h2 at steady state conditions h2 diffuses from the hfm wall into the hydrogel where a concentration profile develops that is dependent on both diffusive transport and catalytic reaction a similar but counter diffusional profile develops for no2 as it diffuses from the bulk through the ldl and into the hydrogel where it is also subject to both reaction and diffusion processes as the h2 partial pressure in the lumen increases with a constant influent no2 concentration the concentration profile shape of both no2 and h2 within the hydrogel change fig 5a at the lowest h2 partial pressures h2 is rapidly consumed by reaction as it leaves the hfm wall and travels into the hydrogel the rz gray region is made up of only a small fraction of the portion of the hydrogel nearest the hfm wall no2 fully penetrates the hydrogel and the no2 concentration within the hydrogel is relatively constant suggesting low catalytic reaction rates and confirms the low no2 removal rates observed experimentally as h2 concentrations increase h2 penetrates deeper into the hydrogel towards the bulk before it is completely consumed by reaction with no2 the increased presence of h2 throughout the membrane generates a quicker reaction rate causing an increase in the no2 concentration gradient as no2 is more rapidly consumed further the rz expands and shifts towards the hydrogel exterior as the h2 partial pressure increases decreasing the average diffusive transport distance for no2 before reaction at the highest h2 concentrations the diffusive transport distance for no2 to enter the rz is minimized and no2 reaction rates are maximized the observed concentration profile changes with increasing reactive species concentrations correlate well with the shifts in experimentally measured r with changes in reactive species concentration when no2 influent concentrations are increased at constant h2 pressure concentration profiles shift in a corresponding manner fig 5b at the lowest no2 concentration all no2 is consumed in a shallow rz near the hydrogel edge as h2 diffuses across much of the hydrogel towards the bulk before reaching no2 species increasing the no2 concentration causes the rz to move deeper into the hydrogel as no2 diffuses further before being consumed by reaction finally at the highest no2 concentration no2 penetrates the entirety of the catalytic hydrogel without being fully consumed while all h2 is consumed rapidly near the hfm wall as no2 concentrations increase the diffusive transport distance of no2 through the hydrogel to the rz increases diffusive mass transport limitations become progressively more influential on overall kinetics as insufficient h2 is delivered to the catalytic hydrogel through the lumen wall to fully reduce no2 and removal rates no longer increase with increased no2 concentrations this trend corresponds well with the experimental results observed in fig 3 where increases in the no2 influent concentration increases r until a limit is reached that is dependent on the h2 confirming the role of diffusive transport on limiting the observed reaction rates the 1 d model is useful for describing the behavior of the chmr continuing work should focus on calibrating the model with experimental data so that it can be used to identify key factors impacting the behavior of the chmr e g flux including hydrogel catalyst density h2 supply pressure influent and bulk no2 concentrations and hydrogel thickness 3 4 effects of select co occurring species on the catalytic activity one of the major challenges for catalytic hydrogenation is deactivation of the catalyst by other species in real waters our previous work showed that catalytic deactivation was minimal over a 3 day reaction period in a hard groundwater containing a relatively high so4 2 concentration suggesting that the catalytic hydrogel may limit deactivation marks et al 2019 to investigate the effects of known pd deactivating species on the catalytic activity of the chmr experiments were conducted in the presence of so3 2 hs and nom for at least 12 h fig 6 the addition of so3 2 5 mg s l resulted in a steady loss of conversion from 61 5 to 50 9 indicating deactivation of the catalyst fig 6a a similar behavior was observed when hs 1 mg s l was spiked into the reactor in a separate experiment fig 6b the initial steady state conversion was lower than the other species because co2 was not used to prevent the formation of h2s at acidic ph conversion in the absence of hs and co2 was 21 8 and this steadily decreased to 2 5 after hs was spiked into the reactor fig 6b indicating deactivation had occurred for nom 5 mg l a different trend was observed compared to the other species initially after adding nom the conversion dropped from 60 3 to 46 8 after 2 5 h but the conversion returned to 58 4 after an additional 12 h of exposure fig 6c this behavior suggests that the deactivating effects of nom in the chmr were temporary the effect of these species on the catalytic activity of pd is supported by previous results chaplin et al 2006 but these results provide evidence that some protection from deactivation is provided by the hydrogel especially in the case of nom to determine the role of the hydrogel the effect of these deactivating species on the intrinsic catalytic activity of the pd nanoparticles in the absence of a hydrogel was evaluated using suspended batch reactor experiments fig s3a in the absence of deactivating species the k was l mol pd 1 s 1 and this decreased to 0 648 and 0 299 l mol pd 1 s 1 in the presence of so3 2 and nom respectively when hs was present no no2 removal was observed suggesting that hs had severely deactivated the catalyst however poor removal was observed even when no hs was present fig s3b due to the high ph phfinal 9 5 when no co2 was used these results are consistent with previous studies evaluating the effects of these deactivating species on pd catalysts chaplin et al 2006 seraj et al 2017 xiao et al 1992 pd deactivation by sulfur compounds remains a challenge but regeneration of the catalyst is a feasible approach chaplin et al 2009 the cause of the reduced deactivation effect of nom using the chmr is less clear batch experiments with suspended particles showed that nom deactivated pd somewhat but it was lower in the chmr this result suggests that the hydrogel prevented nom pd interactions which may be related to the poor transport of the nom through the hydrogel 3 5 hydrogel stability as a function of aqueous conditions the long term stability of the ca alginate hydrogel is a critical challenge to implementation of chmrs for treatment of drinking water fig 7 shows the stability of hydrogels coated on hfms or a range of aqueous conditions relevant to water treatment the effect of ph on stability of ca alginate hydrogels no pd was evaluated between neutral and acidic ph fig 7a below ph 4 ca2 was released from the hydrogel consistent with the protonation of guluronic pka 3 65 and mannuronic pka 3 38 acid moieties of alginate and the transition of the ca alginate to alginic acid chuang et al 2017 the expulsion of ca2 from the hydrogel crosslink sites caused the gel to shift from transparent to opaque as the chemical structure transitions from ionically bound ca alginate to alginic acid gel stabilized by hydrogen bonding draget et al 2006 this transition hampered attempts to investigate catalytic function at acidic ph because the resulting alginic acid gel degraded rapidly due to mixing shear forces thus limiting the aqueous ph above the pka of alginic functional groups is critical to long term stability and catalytic performance of ca alginate based chmr operation at ph 5 8 6 3 as conducted in this study provided an optimal catalytic activity while preventing instability of the ca alginate hydrogel ionic exchange of monovalent cations e g na with ca2 at crosslink sites can eliminate connections between polymer strands and break down the 3d structure of the hydrogel loureiro dos santos 2017 to investigate the effects of monovalent cations on the hydrogel stability and behavior the mass ratio of chms was measured after exposure to solutions of increasing total concentrations of either na only ca2 only or a mixture of na and ca2 fig 7b when only na was present the hydrogel swelled proportionally to the concentration of na indicating a loss of ca alginate crosslinked sites as na exchanged with ca2 the addition of ca2 to the aqueous phase prevented swelling of the hydrogel which was attributed to the affinity of alginate sites for the ca2 idota et al 2016 when both na and ca2 were present at a total concentration of 50 mm 43 8 mm na 6 14 mm ca2 10 1 4 m ratio the hydrogel shrank due to crosslinking of new sites from the additional ca2 matyash et al 2014 these sites were likely initially filled by pd2 species prior to reduction to pd0 thus leaving them open indeed when no na was present hydrogel shrinking was observed even at low ca2 concentrations e g 0 5 mm overall the mass ratio results showed that hydrogel swelling was dependent on the concentration and valence of cations in the aqueous phase shrinking and or swelling of the hydrogel influences the overall catalytic performance of the chmr for example shrinking results in an increased hydrogel density and a smaller pore network that will decrease the diffusivity of aqueous species favre et al 2001 pasut et al 2008 this shrinkage could negatively influence the mass transport and thus the overall reaction rate though shrinking will also result in a decreased hydrogel thickness which would improve the mass transport of the system i e fig 5 the two phenomena work against each other and presumably small changes in the hydrogel mass ratio either due to shrinking or swelling will not significantly affect the reaction rate to investigate the changes in hydrogel swelling under relevant aqueous conditions the mass ratio of hydrogels was measured over 21 d in an ultrapure water or a groundwater fig 7c no significant hydrogel shrink swell 6 mass ratio change was observed over this period in either matrix suggesting that hydrogel structural changes were minimal the na ca2 molar ratio 10 6 1 4 4 mm na 2 7 mm ca2 and total na ca2 concentration 7 1 mm of the groundwater table s5 were similar to those for the model na ca2 mixture at 5 mm 4 4 mm na 0 61 mm ca2 a comparable shrinking behavior between the two was observed with mass ratios of 0 94 and 0 87 respectively the groundwater also contained 1 25 mm mg2 which may have contributed to the crosslinking although the affinity of alginate cross link sites for mg2 is lower than ca2 idota et al 2016 the tendency of pd nanoparticles to leach from the catalytic hydrogel during the stability experiments was investigated by measuring pd concentrations in the aqueous phase after the soaking period pd was only detected in the aqueous phase when concentrations of na greater than 50 mm were used after exposure to a 50 mm na solution only 2 5 μg 0 29 of the total pd present in the hydrogel was detected in the aqueous phase pd leaching is attributed to de linking and swelling of hydrogel structure when major hydrogel swelling was avoided no detectable pd leaching was observed these results show that groundwaters are excellent candidates for the chmr due to the presence of divalent cations that reduce hydrogel swelling source waters with high concentrations of monovalent cations and low concentrations of divalent cations e g some surface waters may need pretreatment addition of ca2 salts before the chmr due to the expansion and degradation of the ca alginate hydrogel 4 conclusions the chmr is an effective system for immobilizing nano sized catalysts to be used for the hydrogenation of oxidized contaminants pd and no2 were used as models in this study because the synthesis of pd and the hydrogenation pathway of no2 are relatively straightforward this simplicity allowed for key factors affecting the chmr performance e g influent reactant concentrations to be evaluated without unnecessary complications e g unknown intermediate reactions the chmr is adaptable to other catalysts and contaminants for contaminants that are treatable using pd e g trichloroethylene lowry and reinhard 2000 no changes to the catalytic hydrogel synthesis process would be required for contaminants that require alternative or more intricate catalysts changes to the synthesis process could be easily implemented for example hydrogenation of nitrate no3 an important drinking water contaminant requires a more complex bimetallic catalyst such as pd in chaplin et al 2012 guo et al 2018 the pd catalyst used herein could be replaced with the pd in catalyst by adding a step in the catalytic hydrogel synthesis process to cover pd with in or the pd in catalysts could be synthesized ex situ and then incorporated during the hydrogel crosslinking step similarly an re pd catalyst could be used to reduce perchlorate clo4 liu et al 2013 for all hydrogenation catalyst and contaminant scenarios the reactivity will be affected similarly by the diffusion reaction processes observed in this study while the optimal operating conditions will change for each scenario the important parameters controlling the overall rate that were explored herein e g influent contaminant concentration h2 supply pressure catalyst density will be universal due to diffusion the steady state concentrations of h2 and no2 will decrease with increasing distance from the bulk source and thus the reaction rate at catalyst sites varies within the hydrogel this affects the width of the reaction zone and highlights the need to optimize the catalytic hydrogel thickness the 1 d model usedd herein for the chmr is useful for predicting reaction profiles in the catalytic hydrogel and tuning its parameters the needs to be calibrated using experimental data and expanded to evaluate important operating parameters such as flux while the hydrogel afforded some protection from the catalyst deactivating species tested especially larger molecules like dom smaller species remain a problem future studies are needed to better understand the molecular scale interactions between pd and naturally occurring deactivating species these results could be used to engineer pd catalysts more resistant to deactivation operationally the h2 usage efficiency can be optimized using a venting strategy and the number of fibers can be increased to treat a wide range of flows and concentrations furthermore the chmr can use existing infrastructure designed for hfm membrane biofilm reactors the use of h2 as a reductant may contribute to biofilm grown on the catalytic hydrogel but this can be mitigated by controlling the h2 concentration so that it is zero at the bulk water interface no biofilm growth was observed in this or previous studies marks et al 2019 but this result should be confirmed under more conditions and

18044,glucocorticoids gcs are one of the most prescribed pharmaceutical classes worldwide they have reached the focus as environmental pollutants in the current scientific research due to their potential risks to aquatic organisms even in the lower ng l 1 range the objective of this study was to determine the kinetic behavior of selected gcs and to identify their main transformation products tps in lab scaled biodegradation experiments therefore we analyzed the removal of 13 gcs in aerated incubation experiments with activated sludge taken from a german municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp as inoculum for all steroids an exponential decrease of the concentrations was observed which was modelled by pseudo first order kinetics overall the rate constants k biol ranged from 0 07 l gss 1 d 1 triamcinolone acetonide to 250 l gss 1 d 1 prednisolone these results emphasize the broad variation in the biodegradability and recalcitrance of certain gcs the selection of the studied gcs enabled a deduction of microbiological stability related to functional groups based on the identified tps a variety of enzymatically mediated reactions were postulated moreover the identified tps are characterized by an intact steroid core structure thus residual endocrine activity cannot be ruled out the main observed reactions were regioselective hydrogenation of carbon double bonds degradation of the steroid c17 side chain ester hydrolysis and oxidative hydroxylation in total 41 tps were tentatively identified and 22 of them were unambiguously confirmed via reference standards additionally 12 tps were detected in the effluents of municipal wwtps and to the best of our knowledge the occurrence of eight of these tps has been shown for the first time these tps might significantly contribute to the detected residual endocrine activities in the aquatic environments therefore there is a strong need for efficient removal strategies in particular for persistent steroid hormones with elevated potencies graphical abstract image 1 keywords biological wastewater treatment steroid hormones transformation products biodegradation triamcinolone acetonide betamethasone 1 introduction in modern medicine glucocorticoids gcs are used for various medical conditions due to the great range of therapeutic properties approx 16 basic gcs are registered in germany this number is increasing since a variety of esterified and functionalized derivatives of the basic gcs are applied rote liste 2016 the fate in the human body depends on their dosage forms e g ointments powders shampoos tablets sprays and their route of administration e g oral dermal inhalation several gcs are designed to be applied on skin or are used systemically in oral dosage forms they are either washed off from the skin unchanged or are excreted via urine and feces after metabolism in the human body afterwards the compounds reach roughly continuous the municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps recent studies indicated an incomplete removal of certain gcs during biological wastewater treatment in full scale wwtps fan et al 2011 wu et al 2019 and lab scale experiments miyamoto et al 2014 especially synthetic compounds such as fluocinolone acetonide triamcinolone acetonide or clobetasol propionate were found to be poorly removed wu et al 2019 and fluticasone propionate was reported as moderately degradable 63 wu et al 2019 in addition miyamoto et al 2014 analyzed the fate of ten gcs during the incubation with activated sludge and showed the recalcitrant behavior of triamcinolone acetonide and fluocinolone acetonide in their laboratory incubation experiments on the other hand pronounced biodegradability was reported for hydrocortisone prednisolone and betamethasone wu et al 2019 miyamoto et al 2014 therefore it is not surprising that particularly synthetic gcs have been detected in wwtp effluents and receiving surface waters worldwide chang et al 2007 schriks et al 2010 jia et al 2016 sonavane et al 2018 weizel et al 2018 the detected concentrations of triamcinolone acetate in wwtp effluents in the usa were as high as 17 9 ng l 1 wu et al 2019 while clobetasol propionate concentrations ranged from 1 04 ng l 1 to 2 35 ng l 1 jia et al 2016 trimacinolone acetonide was found in wwtp effluents in the netherlands schriks et al 2010 and germany weizel et al 2018 in similar concentrations to the usa in wwtp effluents from japan betamethasone valerate and clobetasol propionate were identified as the predominant gcs isobe et al 2015 moreover recent studies highlighted that gcs are potentially harmful to aquatic organisms kugathas and sumpter 2011 kugathas et al 2013 chen et al 2016 lalone et al 2011 willi et al 2018 2019 in vivo effects have been shown for a variety of end points for instance kugathas et al 2013 detected increased plasma glucose concentrations in adult fathead minnows exposed to 100 ng l 1 beclomethasone dipropionate mc neil et al 2016 and willi et al 2018 analyzed the effects of the exposure to different gcs during the development of zebrafish embryos multiple end points which are mediated by endogenous gcs were triggered significantly during the exposure including decreases in spontaneous muscle contractions increases in heart rates and accelerated hatching willi et al 2018 lalone et al 2011 highlighted significant morphological changes of the gonads in male fathead minnows exposed to 100 ng l 1 dexamethasone at higher dexamethasone concentration 500 μg l 1 operculum deformities were observed therefore active gcs are known to mimic endogenous hormones and potentially cause severe adverse effects in aquatic organisms wwtp effluents are the main point source of synthetic gcs into rivers and streams with few exceptions biological wastewater treatment is not able to mineralize organic micropollutants but rather a high variety of transformation products tps are formed and discharged by wwtps reviewed in evgenidou et al 2015 gcs are not mentioned these tps might have similar activities or in a few cases even an enhanced ecotoxicological potential as reported in celiz et al 2009 and cwiertney et al 2014 furthermore it has to be noted that gc mixtures and their tps are likely to induce additive effects in fish as it was recently found for mixtures of fluticasone propionate triamcinolone acetonide and clobetasol propionate willi et al 2019 thus it is crucial to know which stable tps are formed in biological wwtp processes and are discharged by municipal wwtps into rivers and streams to date no comprehensive studies are available dealing with the bio transformation processes of gcs in municipal wwtps even though gcs were one of the first organic molecules manufactured by industrial fermentative processes numerous microbiological transformation reactions for specific gc substrates are already well known reviewed in bhatti and khera 2012 charney and herzog 1967 however the microbial community of wastewater treatment systems is quite diverse wolff et al 2018 and thus an identification of tps in controlled lab scale incubation experiments with activated sludge can be an expedient approach to understand the removal processes of gcs altogether there is a major deficit in knowledge about the fate and behavior of gcs in wwtps in this context the current study was initiated to elucidate and predict the biodegradability and transformation of a range of synthetic gcs therefore we analyzed the fate of 13 gcs during aerobic incubation with activated sludge from municipal wwtps and we elucidated the biological degradation pathways of 12 synthetic gcs 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and compound selection details on chemical reference materials used in this study are summarized in the supporting information si table s1 the gcs were selected based on i their occurrence in wwtp effluents and ii structural similarities to elucidate the importance of certain moieties for their biodegradability and the formation of stable tps the gcs considered can be roughly subdivided into four classes a non halogenated gcs hydrocortisone prednisolone 6α

experiments 200 ml of a homogenized activated sludge slurry was diluted ten fold with wwtp effluents to a final batch volume of 2 l dilution was utilized to minimize sorption on suspended solids and to reduce matrix effects during chemical analysis activated sludge was freshly sampled from the aeration tank of a conventional wwtp capacity 320 000 population equivalents sludge retention time approx 12 d hydraulic retention time approx 6 h total suspended solids approx 4 0 gss l 1 the diluted slurry was continuously aerated with synthetic air and stirred during inoculation to maintain aerobic conditions in addition temperature and ph were controlled over the experiments no significant drifts were observed within the incubation experiments t 1 6 c ph 0 2 an overview of all conducted experiments and the experimental conditions is provided in table 1 after an equilibration time of approx 12 h target steroids were spiked into the diluted activated sludge slurry for the kinetic experiments 2 l sample was spiked with 400 ng of each steroid to reach an analyte concentration of 200 ng l 1 in triplicate for tp identifications single experiments with an initial steroid concentration of 2 μg l 1 were used as a reference negative control one non spiked experiment was included in each experimental sequence in addition sterile inactive control experiments autoclaved for 60 min at 121 c were used to differentiate between biotic and abiotic transformation samples of the batches were taken at defined times for analysis 100 ml of filtered samples 1 μm glass fiber gf6 whatmann maidstone uk were spiked with 2 ng of each isotope labeled internal standard and were subsequently enriched via spe c18ec machery nagel düren germany according to the protocol described by weizel et al 2018 2 3 high resolution mass spectrometry for tp identification and data handling ms2 spectra were recorded by a hybrid quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometer qtof sciex tripletof

nucleoshell rp 18puls macherey nagel prior to detection by qtof a more detailed description of the analytical methods used is provided in the supporting information the acquired data were finally processed by a non target approach for automated peak picking and alignment procedure a data evaluation script in r r development core team 2008 was used a detailed description regarding data processing algorithm is provided in dietrich and ternes 2019 in prep briefly the extraction of xics extracted ion chromatogram was based on the xcms package smith et al 2006 the xics were then checked for local maxima after signal to noise calculation sn 3 and further filtering a peak list was generated afterwards the features were automatically aligned between the samples by comparing m z and retention time of all generated peaks in all samples the final peak lists were obtained by grouping those within a tolerance of m z 5 ppm and rt 10 s finally the peak lists were searched for clear differences in the time courses between spiked batches and non spiked controls for potential tps as criteria for prioritization of potential tps an increasing or decreasing trend or an intermediate maximum of the intensity within the time courses was defined in addition only features detected in three consecutive samples were considered the tentatively identified tps were verified by authentic standards through the comparison of retention times rt accurate masses and ms2 fragmentations in those cases without commercially available standards chemical structures of the tps were proposed by combining the information of retention time shifts isotopic patterns and ms2 fragmentation spectra in addition ms2 spectra of tentatively identified tps were assessed manually by comparing to parent steroids or their related tps 2 4 sampling and analysis of wwtp effluent samples the target gcs and their tps were quantified in eight effluents from wwtps in germany details regarding the sample locations are provided in the supporting information si table s2 the monitored wwtps are equipped with conventional biological treatment trains grab samples were taken directly from wwtp effluents and were immediately cooled prior to the transport to the laboratory the samples were treated within 24 h after sampling according to the protocol described by weizel et al 2018 in brief 500 ml of filtered wwtp effluent 1 μm glass fiber gf6 whatmann were spiked with 2 ng of each isotope labeled internal standard and enriched by spe 6 ml 500 mg c18ec chromabond macherey nagel cartridges were then eluted 3 times with 3 ml methanol and evaporated to dryness by a gentle nitrogen stream at 40 c after reconstitution with 0 3 ml n hexane and 0 7 ml acetone the extracts were loaded onto dried and pre conditioned silica gel cartridges 1 g 6 ml chromabond sioh machery nagel for sample clean up the cartridges were eluted 3 times with 2 ml acetone n hexane 7 3 afterwards the extracts were evaporated via a gentle nitrogen stream at 40 c and were finally dissolved in 250 μl methanol and 250 μl milli q prior to detection it has to be noted that the quantification of carboxylic tps was achieved without silica gel extraction since these polar tps were not desorbed from silica gel cartridges under the used conditions 2 5 quantification of target steroids and tps quantitative analysis was carried out with triplequad lit ms api 6500 qtrap sciex using the smrm scheduled multiple reaction monitoring mode details on the target analysis used are provided in the supporting information and more information can be found in our previous study weizel et al 2018 a calibration curve ranging from 0 05 to 200 ng ml 1 was used for quantification linear regression was applied with a weighting factor 1 x for each analyte the peak areas were corrected by isotope labeled surrogate standards furthermore for quality control a control standard was measured every tenth sample within a sequence and procedural blanks were analyzed within every experimental sequence to determine possible contaminations during the sample treatment the limits of quantification loqs and recoveries were evaluated from spiked wwtp effluents 10 ng l 1 in triplicate the recoveries for all analytes ranged from 71 5 to 107 9 results of the method performance are provided in the supporting information si table s4 3 results and discussion 3 1 kinetic analysis since all studied steroids revealed an exponential decrease in concentration a pseudo first order kinetic was modelled table 2 the degradation rate constants k biol were calculated according to schwarzenbach et al 2005 chemical structures of the analyzed gcs are provided in the supporting information si table s3 the applied kinetic model revealed good linearity for the analyzed steroids r 0 95 except for triamcinolone acetonide 0 898 and the rate constants k biol varied over four orders of magnitude 102to 10 2 l gss 1 d 1 the natural steroid hydrocortisone and its most similar synthetic derivative prednisolone were rapidly degraded within 3 h in the aerated batch experiments with dt50 values dissipation time for 50 removal below the maximum resolution of the experiment 30 min these fast removals of both steroids are consistent with the reported behavior in full scale wwtps chang et al 2007 fan et al 2011 wu et al 2019 and laboratory degradation studies miyamoto et al 2014 furthermore the prodrug betamethasone dipropionate showed a complete removal after 12 h of incubation degradation rates of the corresponding steroid alcohols 6α methylprednisolone beclomethasone and betamethasone were found to be in the same range however significantly lower rates were observed for the 17 monoesters because diesters and monoesters represent precursors of steroid alcohols their removal lead primarily to active gcs however the elevated degradation rate constants of the diesters indicate a high removal in full scale wwtp and thus a low discharge into aquatic environments in contrast the monoesters and their related steroid alcohols were frequently found in wwtp effluents weizel et al 2018 isobe et al 2015 fluticasone propionate and clobetasol propionate are fluorinated gcs with altered side chains both gcs exhibited much lower rate constants k biol 1 2 l gss 1 d 1 dt50 2 d indicating an insufficient removal in wwtps these results are in accordance with the very few reported data wu et al 2019 the lowest degree of biodegradation was observed for cyclic ketal steroids especially the fluorinated ketals triamcinolone acetonide and fluocinolone acetonide were found to be persistent in contact with activated sludge remaining compound after 14 days 70 while budesonide was the most recalcitrant non halogenated gc in this study recently wu et al 2019 indicated the insufficient biodegradability of triamcinolone acetonide and fluocinolone acetonide in a full scale wwtp synthetic gcs were primarily designed for an enhanced glucocorticoidal potency for instance the insertion of halogen substituents leads to increased persistency in the human body bodor and buchwald 2006 whereas the introduction of ester groups increases the lipophilicity and thus its bioavailability through absorption täuber 1994 the biodegradation of gcs in contact with activated sludge seems to be inhibited up to ten fold in comparison to hydrocortisone if a halogen substituent is placed at ring b as it is the case for beclomethasone and betamethasone therefore fluorine and chlorine at c9 substantially enhanced the stability of the steroids in activated sludge treatment dodson and muir 1961 described the generalized degradation route of steroids by the initial hydroxylation at c9 which subsequently leads to the ring fission between c9 and c10 following the 9 10 seco pathway olivera and luengo 2019 it can be assumed that this reaction pathway is inhibited in 9α halo steroids and led to the observed microbiological stability particularly for clobetasol propionate and fluticasone propionate an elevated stability was observed thus it can be concluded that structural modifications at the c21 position lead to a higher stability due to their missing hydroxyl group at the c21 position which is decisive for the migration of the ester moiety ester hydrolysis is discussed in detail in chapter 3 2 2 therefore for both gcs the c17 ester hydrolysis can be excluded as the initial degradation step furthermore steroids with cyclic ketal groups exhibited elevated stability towards microbiological degradation while combinations of structural characteristics led to even higher persistency e g triamcinolone acetonide overall these results are useful to assess the biodegradability of gcs in particular cyclic ketal steroids which are frequently administered in the usa or switzerland such as halcinonide flunisolide or desonide should receive more attention in environmental monitoring campaigns due to expectable limited removals in biological wastewater treatment 3 2 identification of tps and characterization of transformation reactions in total 41 tps were tentatively identified from the 12 gcs analyzed in the single experiments for 22 tps the suggested chemical structure was verified by authentic reference standards structural proposals of the tps without commercially available reference standards were based on the acquired high resolution mass spectrometry hrms data rt shifts and by the analogy to the proved structures chemical structures tentatively and further information of the detected tps are provided in the supporting information si table s3 and analytical results chromatograms mass spectra and time courses can be found in fig s1 based on the identified tps a variety of enzymatically mediated reactions were postulated an overview of the suggested reactions that were observed for the individual gcs is shown in table 3 the following chapters discuss the main outcomes in detail 3 2 1 natural and related glucocorticoids this group of natural and related gcs is characterized by a non halogenated core structure in general they have a rather weak potency due to short plasma half lives and low receptor binding affinities mutschler 1997 although a biodegradation of hydrocortisone and prednisolone was observed no clear tp formation was detected in the analyzed time series it has to be noted that small amounts of prednisolone were detected as an intermediate by lc ms ms during the incubation of hydrocortisone which was rapidly degraded again therefore it can be assumed that a fast degradation led either to tps which are directly incorporated into metabolic pathways of the microorganisms or which have a high polarity and thus cannot be covered by the analytical method used the enrichment techniques were based on reversed phases which are limited in the retention of extreme polar compounds however it has to be noted that in this study only tps with concentrations down to about 5 of the initial concentration could be detected based on these results it can be assumed that the biodegradation of these two compounds might not lead to large amounts of recalcitrant tps in contact with activated sludge and hence it is unlikely they can be detected in wwtp effluents in elevated concentrations 3 2 2 glucocorticoid diesters and monoesters synthetic gcs are often esterified with carboxylic acids such as propionic acid to reinforce therapeutic properties bodor and buchwald 2006 these gc esters are used primarily for topical treatments several ester steroids were considered in our study since their fate and the behavior during wastewater treatment is unknown so far 6α methylprednisolone aceponate beclomethasone 17 propionate beclomethasone dipropionate betamethasone 17 valerate betamethasone dipropionate clobetasol 17 propionate and fluticasone 17 propionate were incubated in independent experiments to enable a clear assignment of the tps identified to the parent gcs a summary of the results is provided in fig 1 the diesters were rapidly removed within 12 h and as their initial degradation reaction the ester hydrolysis was observed as the main tps the monoesters at c17 and c21 positions were identified which were then further hydrolyzed to the corresponding steroid alcohols fig 1 c the hydrolysis of the diester was also detected in the sterile control but the rate of hydrolysis was more than a factor of ten lower fig 1 a the experiments with the c17 monoesters of beclomethasone and betamethasone as initial steroids revealed the formation of the corresponding c21 monoesters as intermediates which can be explained by an intra molecular migration of the ester moiety bungaard and hansen 1981 täuber 1994 sterile and regular experiments showed identical rates for the migration fig 1 b thus it can be concluded that the ester migration is mediated by one or more abiotic reactions which are controlled by ph and temperature bungaard and hansen 1981 täuber 1994 in contrast the hydrolysis of the c21 monoesters was found to be enzymatically catalyzed since in the autoclaved samples the c21 monoesters were found to accumulate over a period during the incubation of the aceponate diester 6α methylprednisolone 17 propionate 21 acetate only the formation of the propionate monoester was identified thus the favored enzymatic hydrolysis of ester moieties occurs obviously at position c21 moreover clobetasol propionate and fluticasone propionate are characterized by a missing hydroxyl group at position c21 since the 21 hydroxy moiety is crucial as a target for the migration of the propionate ester both gcs were not hydrolyzed or rearranged in the experiments t6 and t8 it can therefore be concluded that immediate ester hydrolysis cannot be the initial degradation reaction of c17 ester gcs 3 2 3 formation of glucocorticoid carboxylic acids the analyzed ketal gcs budesonide fluocinolone acetonide triamcinolone acetonide showed a significant stability towards microbiological degradation as outlined in section 3 1 supplementary to the kinetic results similar tps were identified for all studied ketal steroids ketal gcs are characterized by their α hydroxyl groups at c16 and c17 which are acetalized by aliphatic ketones to form cyclic ketals bodor and hansen 1981 gcs with such chemical moieties show strong binding affinity to the gc receptor and are denoted as gcs with an enhanced potency mutschler 1997 during the individual incubation experiments the analyzed ketals showed one characteristic transformation reaction the major tps identified were the c21 carboxylic acids whose formations were confirmed by authentic reference standards si fig s1 the formation of c21 carboxylic acids can be explained by an oxidation of the primary alcohol at c21 and was found only for this group of steroids the time course of the tp formation is shown exemplarily for budesonide in fig 2 a fluticasone propionate is a steroid used for the treatment of asthma and rhinitis several pharmaceuticals with fluticasone propionate as the active ingredient were recently awarded a non prescription status and hence are sold as over the counter drugs in germany bundesrat 2016 as a consequence growing consumption of fluticasone propionate can be forecast for germany in addition the chemical structure of fluticasone propionate was designed to reduce the side effects in the therapy of lung diseases which is attributed to the beneficial ability of the thioester hydrolysis at c17 the metabolic hydrolysis decreases the systemic side effects during the corticosteroid therapy significantly johnson 1998 as the main reaction and initial degradation step of fluticasone propionate the enzymatically mediated hydrolysis of the thioester was identified which finally led to the formation of tp452 the respective 17β carboxylic acid fig 2 for further insights into biodegradability and fate the carboxylic acids of triamcinolone acetonide and fluticasone propionate were analyzed in separate incubation experiments as shown in fig 3 both tested carboxylic acid tps were not degraded at all during the incubation periods and further expected transformation reaction such as hydrogenations or side chain degradation were not observed therefore these results indicate a persistent behavior of the carboxylic tps in biological wastewater treatment 3 2 4 betamethasone and beclomethasone the structural characteristic of betamethasone and its related steroids is the 9α halo moiety e g dexamethasone flumethasone and beclomethasone betamethasone 9α fluoro and beclomethasone 9α chloro were selected as initial substances for tracking the fate during biodegradation since both gcs are in widespread use in germany the time courses of tp formation and the tentative pathway of the observed betamethasone biotransformation in activated sludge are shown in fig 4 the proposed degradation pathway of beclomethasone dipropionate is illustrated in fig 5 detailed information to the verified or proposed tps is provided in the supporting information during the incubation experiments of both gcs the formation of four similar tps has been detected betamethasone tp332 tp348a tp412 and tp414 beclomethasone tp348b tp364 tp428 and tp430 thus comparable degradation pathways were identified for betamethasone and beclomethasone the biodegradation of betamethasone revealed the formation of 17 oxo betamethasone oxobms whose retention time and ms2 matched that of an authentic reference standard however 17 oxo betamethasone was detected to a minor extent fig 4 a but appreciable quantities were found for an isomeric tp tp332 for beclomethasone an analogic tp tp348b was formed both tp332 and tp348b were identified as the major tps formed during the biodegradation of the analyzed betamethasone and beclomethasone derivatives the comparison of the ms2 spectra of 17 oxo betamethasone and tp332 revealed a high structural similarity since fragmentation pattern for both compounds were comparable si fig s2 however the rt shift between tp332 and 17 oxo betamethasone δrt 3 1 min suggested a more polar compound and thus a 17β hydroxy 6 7 dehydro derivative was tentatively proposed for tp332 and tp348b as the most plausible structure whereas the exact position of the carbon double bond could not been determined since reference standards of these tps were not commercially available for confirmation of the rt shift between 17β hydroxy and 17 oxo steroids two commercially available steroid pairs estrone 17β estradiol and androstenedione testosterone were analyzed under the same chromatographic conditions data not shown the rt shifts were found to be similar to those for tp332 and oxobms which supported the proposed 17β hydroxyl moiety of tp332 and tp348b for further insights 17 oxo betamethasone was spiked as the initial compound in a separate experiment a fast and nearly complete enzymatically mediated isomerization to tp332 fig 4 b was found revealing the 17 oxo tps as intermediates in the biodegradation of betamethasone and related gcs such behavior was not observed for the ketal steroids clobetasol propionate and fluticasone propionate therefore it is likely that the 17α hydroxyl group is crucial as a reactive site for the transformation since in all these gcs the 17α hydroxyl group is protected and the side chain degradation has not been observed on the other hand steric effects of the 17α substituents might be responsible for the inhibition of the side chain cleavage the enzymatic conversion of the steroid side chain to yield 17 oxo and 17β hydroxy steroids was proposed to occur in the biodegradation of hydrocortisone wang et al 2018 and progesterone yu et al 2018 this transformation is an important reaction in the biosynthesis of androgens in mammals which is catalyzed by cytochrome p450 17a1 yoshimoto and auchus 2015 on the other hand the reversible reduction of the steroid 17 oxo moiety constitutes an important control mechanism for nuclear receptor ligands lukacik et al 2006 for example the enzymatic conversion of estrone to 17β estradiol khanal et al 2006 and androstenedione to testosterone bhatti and kehra 2012 regulates the ratio of the active 17β hydroxy steroid and the less active 17 oxo analogue in the endogenous endocrine system in humans nevertheless tp332 and tp348b were degraded to tp348a tp of betamethasone and tp364 tp of beclomethasone which were tentatively proposed as hydroxylated derivatives for both gcs the amount of their formation was below 15 according to previous studies the hydroxyl group was suspected to be at ring b since hydroxylation of steroids in the human metabolism revealed usually c6 hydroxylated products butler and gray 1970 during further incubation tp412 and tp414 tps of betamethasone as well as tp428 and tp430 analogic tps of beclomethasone were formed and could be identified as o sulfated tps the ms2 spectra of the tps clearly indicated the presence of aliphatic sulfate conjugates si fig s1 sulfation is a known enzymatic reaction of hydroxylic moieties occurring in biological wastewater treatment as reported in el sharkawy et al 1991 and jewell et al 2015 in contrast to the analogy of the biodegradation of betamethasone and beclomethasone the beclomethasone derivatives were found to undergo intramolecular epoxidations between the c9 and c11 position which led to the formation of three epoxy tps tp428a tp428b and tp372 these epoxy tps could be unambiguously confirmed via authentic reference standards and their formation was observed in the sterile control as well the epoxidation of chlorohydrins trans 1 chloro 2 hydroxy hydrocarbons can be enzymatically catalyzed fauzi et al 1996 or be promoted by alkaline conditions such intramolecular epoxidation was not observed for 9α fluoro steroids since fluorine is not a good leaving group due to its elevated basicity 3 2 5 hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of steroid ring a the regulation of the steroid activity in humans is often coupled to hydrogenation dehydrogenation of carbon bonds in steroid ring a hanukoglu 1992 for instance the weak androgen testosterone is activated by the enzyme 5α reductase and leads to the formation of the potent androgen 5α dihydro testosterone dht moreover the δ1 dehydrogenation dehydrogenation between c1 and c2 is associated to the four fold enhancement of the gc activity of prednisolone in comparison to hydrocortisone mutschler 1997 on the other hand hydrogenation can also lead to an increased affinity to other steroid receptors as it was previously reported for norethisterone and its hydrogenated metabolites larrea et al 2001 therefore the steroid activity is impacted by the presence and position of double bonds in this study hydrogenation of the carbon double bond at position c4 and c5 δ4 hydrogenation was identified as the primary transformation reaction of several gcs and was identified for budesonide clobetasol propionate fluticasone propionate fluocinolone acetonide and triamcinolone acetonide si table s3 fig s1 in addition the formation of two hydrogenated tp isomers δ1 and δ4 dihydro was detected for budesonide fluocinolone acetonide and fluticasone propionate although one tp was in all cases dominant the comparison with authentic reference standards of the corresponding 1 2 dihydro compounds confirmed that the δ1 hydrogenated tps 1 2 dihydro were formed to a minor extent since both isomers could be clearly distinguished by their rts it should be noted that the δ4 hydrogenated tps 4 5 dihydro were not commercially available for reference however the ms2 spectra showed considerable similarities ms2 spectra are provided in the si and the reduction of the 3 oxo moiety could be excluded since all tps showed a positive rt shift in comparison to their parent gcs when 1 2 dihydro fluticasone propionate tp502b was incubated as the initial compound the formation of appreciable amounts of fluticasone propionate and the δ4 dihydro tp tp502a were detected in other words δ1 dehydrogenation of tp502b results in the formation of fluticasone propionate which was then further converted to tp502a via δ4 hydrogenation a similar behavior was noted during the incubation of 1 2 dihydro clobetasol propionate and hydrocortisone was found to be converted to prednisolone which is the δ1 dehydro derivative of hydrocortisone the time courses of the tp formation for the fluticasone propionate and the 1 2 dihydro fluticasone propionate tp502b experiments are illustrated in fig 6 c and d chromatographic separation of the hydrogenated tps is shown exemplarily for the incubation of 1 2 dihydro fluticasone propionate tp502b in fig 6 a as δ4 hydrogenation of fluticasone propionate leads to the formation of tp502a while δ4 hydrogenation of 1 2 dihydro fluticasone propionate tp502b yields tp504 the tetra hydrogenated derivative δ4 hydrogenation seems to be the dominant reaction in both experiments the main tp was the product of the enzymatic reduction of the c4 c5 double bond the preferred formation of 4 5 dihydro fluticasone propionate tp502a suggest therefore strong regioselectivity of the enzymatic hydrogenation and was likewise noted for other gcs in this study on the other hand 1 2 hydrogenated steroids showed a considerable level of δ1 dehydrogenation the enzymatically mediated δ1 dehydrogenation was previously reported during the biodegradation of progesterone yu et al 2018 and hydrocortisone bredehöft et al 2012 and seems to be a prevalent transformation reaction of 3 on 4 ene steroids the hydrogenation of the double bond at c4 and c5 δ4 hydrogenation can yield 5α or 5β hydrogenated tps and thus to a significant change in the geometry of the steroid core as the results indicated the formation of one major δ4 hydrogenated tp for a broad range of gcs it can be expected that the enzymatic δ4 hydrogenation is stereospecific although an identification of the stereochemistry was impossible due to the missing reference materials these hypotheses need to be addressed in further research finally a proposal of a general scheme of the favored sites and reactions was derived and illustrated in fig 7 since the evaluation of the detected tps revealed a strong regio and stereoselectivity of the transformation reactions during the incubation of gcs with activated sludge 3 3 occurrence of glucocorticoids and tps in wwtp effluents the occurrence of the target gcs and tps was investigated in eight german wwtps equipped with conventional biological treatment units for quantification the previously reported method was optimized for the tps weizel et al 2018 details of the applied analytical method si table s4 results of the analyzed wwtp effluents si table s5 figs s4 s6 and detailed sample information si table s2 can be found in the supporting information in order to estimate the transferability of the insights of the degradation study tps were proposed for mometasone furoate tp 9 11 epoxy mometasone furoate and 6β hydroxy triamcinolone acetonide 6β hydroxy 21 oic triamcinolone acetonide both parent compounds were not considered in the experiments mentioned above but were recently detected at elevated concentrations in wwtp effluents weizel et al 2018 thus the probability of detecting them was given as shown in table 4 six of the 13 parent gcs were detected in all wwtp effluents the highest concentrations were found for triamcinolone acetonide up to 20 ng l 1 followed by clobetasol propionate up to 3 8 ng l 1 the betamethasone monoesters up to 3 1 ng l 1 and mometasone furoate up to 1 9 ng l 1 respectively moreover 11 tps could be detected and quantified via their calibration standards table 4 all of the analyzed wwtp effluents contained the carboxylic acid tps of triamcinolone acetonide tp448 its metabolite 6β hydroxy triamcinolone acetonide and fluticasone propionate tp458 the concentration of tp458 was in all cases higher than its parent gc fluticasone propionate with a maximum concentration of 2 8 ng l 1 the results therefore indicate that these carboxylic acid tps are widely present in wwtp effluents and thus discharged in rivers and streams it has to be noted that these tps are also discharged into the wwtps by domestic wastewater since they are human metabolites argenti et al 2013 pearce et al 2006 although carboxy tps are rather inactive gc receptor agonists in comparison to the parent steroids johnson et al 1998 further research is recommended to rule out a possible adverse effect to waterborne organisms by cross receptor affinities furthermore the sampling campaign revealed the ubiquitous occurrence of the betamethasone monoesters betamethasone 17 valerate was detected from 0 6 to 3 1 ng l 1 and the 21 valerate ranged from 0 4 to 1 1 ng l 1 table 4 in addition betamethasone 17 propionate 0 6 1 6 ng l 1 and 21 propionate 0 5 1 3 ng l 1 were frequently detected in the analyzed wwtp effluents since these monoesters are predicted to be precursors of betamethasone the exclusion of such gcs leads to a considerable underestimation of the overall concentration of betamethasone not least because gc mixtures induce additive effects willi et al 2019 the secondary betamethasone tps 17 oxo betamethasone and tp332 could be detected in two and three wwtp effluents respectively 17 oxo and 17 hydroxy steroids are known to trigger the androgen receptor thus the tps could contribute to residual bioactivities in wwtp effluents as was recently reported houtman et al 2018 moreover the conjugated tp of 17 oxo betamethasone tp412 was found in all wwtp effluents si fig s4 since conjugation of steroids is a reversible process tp412 can be assumed to be a precursor of tp332 cwiertny et al 2014 however due to the missing reference standard for tp412 its quantification was not possible on the other hand the hydrogenated tps were all below the limit of quantification loq it can be assumed that the average hydraulic retention time in the biological treatment compartments is not high enough for the extensive generation of hydrogenated tps and thus the concentrations of tps may be too low for analytical detection nevertheless the analysis of the grab samples revealed the presence of several of the newly identified tps in wwtp effluents monitoring campaigns of daily composite samples could be valuable for mass balance analysis and give greater insights into the occurrence of gcs and their tps in such engineered systems for microbiological wastewater treatment 4 conclusions the range of investigated compounds enabled new insights into the biodegradation process of gcs together with the elucidation of tps and transformation reactions the results allowed the following conclusions the spectrum of the analyzed gcs showed a pronounced variability in aerobic degradation in this context structural features that led to a distinct increase in stability could be characterized thus on the basis of the current results the bio degradability of gcs in biological wastewater treatment can be predicted by means of the chemical structure also the results from previous studies can be better interpreted as this shows that the higher stability primarily leads to the glucocorticoid burden in the environment and not exclusively the consumption pattern steroid hormones in general are considered as biodegradable within the group of gcs the results highlights that certain synthetic steroids are recalcitrant in aerobic wastewater processes especially triamcinolone acetonide and further ketal steroids therefore there is a strong need for efficient removal strategies in particular for persistent hormones with elevated potencies within the identified tps the carboxylic acids of fluticasone propionate and triamcinolone acetonide were found to be persistent and as a consequence they were detected in all wwtp effluents also ester isomerization of c17 monoester gcs 6α methylprednisolone propionate beclomethasone propionate betamethasone propionate betamethasone valerate needs to be considered for monitoring since both esters c17 monoesters and c21 monoesters were present in treated wastewater at elevated concentrations contrarily to their diesters in addition the determined transformation reactions were successfully transferred to other gcs which could then be detected in the effluents of several wwtps therefore the identified tps emphasize that similar structural moieties lead to equivalent biotransformation and thus similar tps are generated tracking the main tps is seen

18044,glucocorticoids gcs are one of the most prescribed pharmaceutical classes worldwide they have reached the focus as environmental pollutants in the current scientific research due to their potential risks to aquatic organisms even in the lower ng l 1 range the objective of this study was to determine the kinetic behavior of selected gcs and to identify their main transformation products tps in lab scaled biodegradation experiments therefore we analyzed the removal of 13 gcs in aerated incubation experiments with activated sludge taken from a german municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp as inoculum for all steroids an exponential decrease of the concentrations was observed which was modelled by pseudo first order kinetics overall the rate constants k biol ranged from 0 07 l gss 1 d 1 triamcinolone acetonide to 250 l gss 1 d 1 prednisolone these results emphasize the broad variation in the biodegradability and recalcitrance of certain gcs the selection of the studied gcs enabled a deduction of microbiological stability related to functional groups based on the identified tps a variety of enzymatically mediated reactions were postulated moreover the identified tps are characterized by an intact steroid core structure thus residual endocrine activity cannot be ruled out the main observed reactions were regioselective hydrogenation of carbon double bonds degradation of the steroid c17 side chain ester hydrolysis and oxidative hydroxylation in total 41 tps were tentatively identified and 22 of them were unambiguously confirmed via reference standards additionally 12 tps were detected in the effluents of municipal wwtps and to the best of our knowledge the occurrence of eight of these tps has been shown for the first time these tps might significantly contribute to the detected residual endocrine activities in the aquatic environments therefore there is a strong need for efficient removal strategies in particular for persistent steroid hormones with elevated potencies graphical abstract image 1 keywords biological wastewater treatment steroid hormones transformation products biodegradation triamcinolone acetonide betamethasone 1 introduction in modern medicine glucocorticoids gcs are used for various medical conditions due to the great range of therapeutic properties approx 16 basic gcs are registered in germany this number is increasing since a variety of esterified and functionalized derivatives of the basic gcs are applied rote liste 2016 the fate in the human body depends on their dosage forms e g ointments powders shampoos tablets sprays and their route of administration e g oral dermal inhalation several gcs are designed to be applied on skin or are used systemically in oral dosage forms they are either washed off from the skin unchanged or are excreted via urine and feces after metabolism in the human body afterwards the compounds reach roughly continuous the municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps recent studies indicated an incomplete removal of certain gcs during biological wastewater treatment in full scale wwtps fan et al 2011 wu et al 2019 and lab scale experiments miyamoto et al 2014 especially synthetic compounds such as fluocinolone acetonide triamcinolone acetonide or clobetasol propionate were found to be poorly removed wu et al 2019 and fluticasone propionate was reported as moderately degradable 63 wu et al 2019 in addition miyamoto et al 2014 analyzed the fate of ten gcs during the incubation with activated sludge and showed the recalcitrant behavior of triamcinolone acetonide and fluocinolone acetonide in their laboratory incubation experiments on the other hand pronounced biodegradability was reported for hydrocortisone prednisolone and betamethasone wu et al 2019 miyamoto et al 2014 therefore it is not surprising that particularly synthetic gcs have been detected in wwtp effluents and receiving surface waters worldwide chang et al 2007 schriks et al 2010 jia et al 2016 sonavane et al 2018 weizel et al 2018 the detected concentrations of triamcinolone acetate in wwtp effluents in the usa were as high as 17 9 ng l 1 wu et al 2019 while clobetasol propionate concentrations ranged from 1 04 ng l 1 to 2 35 ng l 1 jia et al 2016 trimacinolone acetonide was found in wwtp effluents in the netherlands schriks et al 2010 and germany weizel et al 2018 in similar concentrations to the usa in wwtp effluents from japan betamethasone valerate and clobetasol propionate were identified as the predominant gcs isobe et al 2015 moreover recent studies highlighted that gcs are potentially harmful to aquatic organisms kugathas and sumpter 2011 kugathas et al 2013 chen et al 2016 lalone et al 2011 willi et al 2018 2019 in vivo effects have been shown for a variety of end points for instance kugathas et al 2013 detected increased plasma glucose concentrations in adult fathead minnows exposed to 100 ng l 1 beclomethasone dipropionate mc neil et al 2016 and willi et al 2018 analyzed the effects of the exposure to different gcs during the development of zebrafish embryos multiple end points which are mediated by endogenous gcs were triggered significantly during the exposure including decreases in spontaneous muscle contractions increases in heart rates and accelerated hatching willi et al 2018 lalone et al 2011 highlighted significant morphological changes of the gonads in male fathead minnows exposed to 100 ng l 1 dexamethasone at higher dexamethasone concentration 500 μg l 1 operculum deformities were observed therefore active gcs are known to mimic endogenous hormones and potentially cause severe adverse effects in aquatic organisms wwtp effluents are the main point source of synthetic gcs into rivers and streams with few exceptions biological wastewater treatment is not able to mineralize organic micropollutants but rather a high variety of transformation products tps are formed and discharged by wwtps reviewed in evgenidou et al 2015 gcs are not mentioned these tps might have similar activities or in a few cases even an enhanced ecotoxicological potential as reported in celiz et al 2009 and cwiertney et al 2014 furthermore it has to be noted that gc mixtures and their tps are likely to induce additive effects in fish as it was recently found for mixtures of fluticasone propionate triamcinolone acetonide and clobetasol propionate willi et al 2019 thus it is crucial to know which stable tps are formed in biological wwtp processes and are discharged by municipal wwtps into rivers and streams to date no comprehensive studies are available dealing with the bio transformation processes of gcs in municipal wwtps even though gcs were one of the first organic molecules manufactured by industrial fermentative processes numerous microbiological transformation reactions for specific gc substrates are already well known reviewed in bhatti and khera 2012 charney and herzog 1967 however the microbial community of wastewater treatment systems is quite diverse wolff et al 2018 and thus an identification of tps in controlled lab scale incubation experiments with activated sludge can be an expedient approach to understand the removal processes of gcs altogether there is a major deficit in knowledge about the fate and behavior of gcs in wwtps in this context the current study was initiated to elucidate and predict the biodegradability and transformation of a range of synthetic gcs therefore we analyzed the fate of 13 gcs during aerobic incubation with activated sludge from municipal wwtps and we elucidated the biological degradation pathways of 12 synthetic gcs 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and compound selection details on chemical reference materials used in this study are summarized in the supporting information si table s1 the gcs were selected based on i their occurrence in wwtp effluents and ii structural similarities to elucidate the importance of certain moieties for their biodegradability and the formation of stable tps the gcs considered can be roughly subdivided into four classes a non halogenated gcs hydrocortisone prednisolone 6α methylprednisolone aceponate b halogenated gcs beclomethasone dipropionate beclomethasone betamethasone dipropionate betamethasone 17 valerate betamethasone c halogenated gcs with altered side chains clobetasol propionate fluticasone propionate and d c16 c17 ketal gcs budesonide fluocinolone acetonide triamcinolone acetonide 2 2 biodegradation batch systems with activated sludge for the lab scale experiments 200 ml of a homogenized activated sludge slurry was diluted ten fold with wwtp effluents to a final batch volume of 2 l dilution was utilized to minimize sorption on suspended solids and to reduce matrix effects during chemical analysis activated sludge was freshly sampled from the aeration tank of a conventional wwtp capacity 320 000 population equivalents sludge retention time approx 12 d hydraulic retention time approx 6 h total suspended solids approx 4 0 gss l 1 the diluted slurry was continuously aerated with synthetic air and stirred during inoculation to maintain aerobic conditions in addition temperature and ph were controlled over the experiments no significant drifts were observed within the incubation experiments t 1 6 c ph 0 2 an overview of all conducted experiments and the experimental conditions is provided in table 1 after an equilibration time of approx 12 h target steroids were spiked into the diluted activated sludge slurry for the kinetic experiments 2 l sample was spiked with 400 ng of each steroid to reach an analyte concentration of 200 ng l 1 in triplicate for tp identifications single experiments with an initial steroid concentration of 2 μg l 1 were used as a reference negative control one non spiked experiment was included in each experimental sequence in addition sterile inactive control experiments autoclaved for 60 min at 121 c were used to differentiate between biotic and abiotic transformation samples of the batches were taken at defined times for analysis 100 ml of filtered samples 1 μm glass fiber gf6 whatmann maidstone uk were spiked with 2 ng of each isotope labeled internal standard and were subsequently enriched via spe c18ec machery nagel düren germany according to the protocol described by weizel et al 2018 2 3 high resolution mass spectrometry for tp identification and data handling ms2 spectra were recorded by a hybrid quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometer qtof sciex tripletof

nucleoshell rp 18puls macherey nagel prior to detection by qtof a more detailed description of the analytical methods used is provided in the supporting information the acquired data were finally processed by a non target approach for automated peak picking and alignment procedure a data evaluation script in r r development core team 2008 was used a detailed description regarding data processing algorithm is provided in dietrich and ternes 2019 in prep briefly the extraction of xics extracted ion chromatogram was based on the xcms package smith et al 2006 the xics were then checked for local maxima after signal to noise calculation sn 3 and further filtering a peak list was generated afterwards the features were automatically aligned between the samples by comparing m z and retention time of all generated peaks in all samples the final peak lists were obtained by grouping those within a tolerance of m z 5 ppm and rt 10 s finally the peak lists were searched for clear differences in the time courses between spiked batches and non spiked controls for potential tps as criteria for prioritization of potential tps an increasing or decreasing trend or an intermediate maximum of the intensity within the time courses was defined in addition only features detected in three consecutive samples were considered the tentatively identified tps were verified by authentic standards through the comparison of retention times rt accurate masses and ms2 fragmentations in those cases without commercially available standards chemical structures of the tps were proposed by combining the information of retention time shifts isotopic patterns and ms2 fragmentation spectra in addition ms2 spectra of tentatively identified tps were assessed manually by comparing to parent steroids or their related tps 2 4 sampling and analysis of wwtp effluent samples the target gcs and their tps were quantified in eight effluents from wwtps in germany details regarding the sample locations are provided in the supporting information si table s2 the monitored wwtps are equipped with conventional biological treatment trains grab samples were taken directly from wwtp effluents and were immediately cooled prior to the transport to the laboratory the samples were treated within 24 h after sampling according to the protocol described by weizel et al 2018 in brief 500 ml of filtered wwtp effluent 1 μm glass fiber gf6 whatmann were spiked with 2 ng of each isotope labeled internal standard and enriched by spe 6 ml 500 mg c18ec chromabond macherey nagel cartridges were then eluted 3 times with 3 ml methanol and evaporated to dryness by a gentle nitrogen stream at 40 c after reconstitution with 0 3 ml n hexane and 0 7 ml acetone the extracts were loaded onto dried and pre conditioned silica gel cartridges 1 g 6 ml chromabond sioh machery nagel for sample clean up the cartridges were eluted 3 times with 2 ml acetone n hexane 7 3 afterwards the extracts were evaporated via a gentle nitrogen stream at 40 c and were finally dissolved in 250 μl methanol and 250 μl milli q prior to detection it has to be noted that the quantification of carboxylic tps was achieved without silica gel extraction since these polar tps were not desorbed from silica gel cartridges under the used conditions 2 5 quantification of target steroids and tps quantitative analysis was carried out with triplequad lit ms api 6500 qtrap sciex using the smrm scheduled multiple reaction monitoring mode details on the target analysis used are provided in the supporting information and more information can be found in our previous study weizel et al 2018 a calibration curve ranging from 0 05 to 200 ng ml 1 was used for quantification linear regression was applied with a weighting factor 1 x for each analyte the peak areas were corrected by isotope labeled surrogate standards furthermore for quality control a control standard was measured every tenth sample within a sequence and procedural blanks were analyzed within every experimental sequence to determine possible contaminations during the sample treatment the limits of quantification loqs and recoveries were evaluated from spiked wwtp effluents 10 ng l 1 in triplicate the recoveries for all analytes ranged from 71 5 to 107 9 results of the method performance are provided in the supporting information si table s4 3 results and discussion 3 1 kinetic analysis since all studied steroids revealed an exponential decrease in concentration a pseudo first order kinetic was modelled table 2 the degradation rate constants k biol were calculated according to schwarzenbach et al 2005 chemical structures of the analyzed gcs are provided in the supporting information si table s3 the applied kinetic model revealed good linearity for the analyzed steroids r 0 95 except for triamcinolone acetonide 0 898 and the rate constants k biol varied over four orders of magnitude 102to 10 2 l gss 1 d 1 the natural steroid hydrocortisone and its most similar synthetic derivative prednisolone were rapidly degraded within 3 h in the aerated batch experiments with dt50 values dissipation time for 50 removal below the maximum resolution of the experiment 30 min these fast removals of both steroids are consistent with the reported behavior in full scale wwtps chang et al 2007 fan et al 2011 wu et al 2019 and laboratory degradation studies miyamoto et al 2014 furthermore the prodrug betamethasone dipropionate showed a complete removal after 12 h of incubation degradation rates of the corresponding steroid alcohols 6α methylprednisolone beclomethasone and betamethasone were found to be in the same range however significantly lower rates were observed for the 17 monoesters because diesters and monoesters represent precursors of steroid alcohols their removal lead primarily to active gcs however the elevated degradation rate constants of the diesters indicate a high removal in full scale wwtp and thus a low discharge into aquatic environments in contrast the monoesters and their related steroid alcohols were frequently found in wwtp effluents weizel et al 2018 isobe et al 2015 fluticasone propionate and clobetasol propionate are fluorinated gcs with altered side chains both gcs exhibited much lower rate constants k biol 1 2 l gss 1 d 1 dt50 2 d indicating an insufficient removal in wwtps these results are in accordance with the very few reported data wu et al 2019 the lowest degree of biodegradation was observed for cyclic ketal steroids especially the fluorinated ketals triamcinolone acetonide and fluocinolone acetonide were found to be persistent in contact with activated sludge remaining compound after 14 days 70 while budesonide was the most recalcitrant non halogenated gc in this study recently wu et al 2019 indicated the insufficient biodegradability of triamcinolone acetonide and fluocinolone acetonide in a full scale wwtp synthetic gcs were primarily designed for an enhanced glucocorticoidal potency for instance the insertion of halogen substituents leads to increased persistency in the human body bodor and buchwald 2006 whereas the introduction of ester groups increases the lipophilicity and thus its bioavailability through absorption täuber 1994 the biodegradation of gcs in contact with activated sludge seems to be inhibited up to ten fold in comparison to hydrocortisone if a halogen substituent is placed at ring b as it is the case for beclomethasone and betamethasone therefore fluorine and chlorine at c9 substantially enhanced the stability of the steroids in activated sludge treatment dodson and muir 1961 described the generalized degradation route of steroids by the initial hydroxylation at c9 which subsequently leads to the ring fission between c9 and c10 following the 9 10 seco pathway olivera and luengo 2019 it can be assumed that this reaction pathway is inhibited in 9α halo steroids and led to the observed microbiological stability particularly for clobetasol propionate and fluticasone propionate an elevated stability was observed thus it can be concluded that structural modifications at the c21 position lead to a higher stability due to their missing hydroxyl group at the c21 position which is decisive for the migration of the ester moiety ester hydrolysis is discussed in detail in chapter 3 2 2 therefore for both gcs the c17 ester hydrolysis can be excluded as the initial degradation step furthermore steroids with cyclic ketal groups exhibited elevated stability towards microbiological degradation while combinations of structural characteristics led to even higher persistency e g triamcinolone acetonide overall these results are useful to assess the biodegradability of gcs in particular cyclic ketal steroids which are frequently administered in the usa or switzerland such as halcinonide flunisolide or desonide should receive more attention in environmental monitoring campaigns due to expectable limited removals in biological wastewater treatment 3 2 identification of tps and characterization of transformation reactions in total 41 tps were tentatively identified from the 12 gcs analyzed in the single experiments for 22 tps the suggested chemical structure was verified by authentic reference standards structural proposals of the tps without commercially available reference standards were based on the acquired high resolution mass spectrometry hrms data rt shifts and by the analogy to the proved structures chemical structures tentatively and further information of the detected tps are provided in the supporting information si table s3 and analytical results chromatograms mass spectra and time courses can be found in fig s1 based on the identified tps a variety of enzymatically mediated reactions were postulated an overview of the suggested reactions that were observed for the individual gcs is shown in table 3 the following chapters discuss the main outcomes in detail 3 2 1 natural and related glucocorticoids this group of natural and related gcs is characterized by a non halogenated core structure in general they have a rather weak potency due to short plasma half lives and low receptor binding affinities mutschler 1997 although a biodegradation of hydrocortisone and prednisolone was observed no clear tp formation was detected in the analyzed time series it has to be noted that small amounts of prednisolone were detected as an intermediate by lc ms ms during the incubation of hydrocortisone which was rapidly degraded again therefore it can be assumed that a fast degradation led either to tps which are directly incorporated into metabolic pathways of the microorganisms or which have a high polarity and thus cannot be covered by the analytical method used the enrichment techniques were based on reversed phases which are limited in the retention of extreme polar compounds however it has to be noted that in this study only tps with concentrations down to about 5 of the initial concentration could be detected based on these results it can be assumed that the biodegradation of these two compounds might not lead to large amounts of recalcitrant tps in contact with activated sludge and hence it is unlikely they can be detected in wwtp effluents in elevated concentrations 3 2 2 glucocorticoid diesters and monoesters synthetic gcs are often esterified with carboxylic acids such as propionic acid to reinforce therapeutic properties bodor and buchwald 2006 these gc esters are used primarily for topical treatments several ester steroids were considered in our study since their fate and the behavior during wastewater treatment is unknown so far 6α methylprednisolone aceponate beclomethasone 17 propionate beclomethasone dipropionate betamethasone 17 valerate betamethasone dipropionate clobetasol 17 propionate and fluticasone 17 propionate were incubated in independent experiments to enable a clear assignment of the tps identified to the parent gcs a summary of the results is provided in fig 1 the diesters were rapidly removed within 12 h and as their initial degradation reaction the ester hydrolysis was observed as the main tps the monoesters at c17 and c21 positions were identified which were then further hydrolyzed to the corresponding steroid alcohols fig 1 c the hydrolysis of the diester was also detected in the sterile control but the rate of hydrolysis was more than a factor of ten lower fig 1 a the experiments with the c17 monoesters of beclomethasone and betamethasone as initial steroids revealed the formation of the corresponding c21 monoesters as intermediates which can be explained by an intra molecular migration of the ester moiety bungaard and hansen 1981 täuber 1994 sterile and regular experiments showed identical rates for the migration fig 1 b thus it can be concluded that the ester migration is mediated by one or more abiotic reactions which are controlled by ph and temperature bungaard and hansen 1981 täuber 1994 in contrast the hydrolysis of the c21 monoesters was found to be enzymatically catalyzed since in the autoclaved samples the c21 monoesters were found to accumulate over a period during the incubation of the aceponate diester 6α methylprednisolone 17 propionate 21 acetate only the formation of the propionate monoester was identified thus the favored enzymatic hydrolysis of ester moieties occurs obviously at position c21 moreover clobetasol propionate and fluticasone propionate are characterized by a missing hydroxyl group at position c21 since the 21 hydroxy moiety is crucial as a target for the migration of the propionate ester both gcs were not hydrolyzed or rearranged in the experiments t6 and t8 it can therefore be concluded that immediate ester hydrolysis cannot be the initial degradation reaction of c17 ester gcs 3 2 3 formation of glucocorticoid carboxylic acids the analyzed ketal gcs budesonide fluocinolone acetonide triamcinolone acetonide showed a significant stability towards microbiological degradation as outlined in section 3 1 supplementary to the kinetic results similar tps were identified for all studied ketal steroids ketal gcs are characterized by their α hydroxyl groups at c16 and c17 which are acetalized by aliphatic ketones to form cyclic ketals bodor and hansen 1981 gcs with such chemical moieties show strong binding affinity to the gc receptor and are denoted as gcs with an enhanced potency mutschler 1997 during the individual incubation experiments the analyzed ketals showed one characteristic transformation reaction the major tps identified were the c21 carboxylic acids whose formations were confirmed by authentic reference standards si fig s1 the formation of c21 carboxylic acids can be explained by an oxidation of the primary alcohol at c21 and was found only for this group of steroids the time course of the tp formation is shown exemplarily for budesonide in fig 2 a fluticasone propionate is a steroid used for the treatment of asthma and rhinitis several pharmaceuticals with fluticasone propionate as the active ingredient were recently awarded a non prescription status and hence are sold as over the counter drugs in germany bundesrat 2016 as a consequence growing consumption of fluticasone propionate can be forecast for germany in addition the chemical structure of fluticasone propionate was designed to reduce the side effects in the therapy of lung diseases which is attributed to the beneficial ability of the thioester hydrolysis at c17 the metabolic hydrolysis decreases the systemic side effects during the corticosteroid therapy significantly johnson 1998 as the main reaction and initial degradation step of fluticasone propionate the enzymatically mediated hydrolysis of the thioester was identified which finally led to the formation of tp452 the respective 17β carboxylic acid fig 2 for further insights into biodegradability and fate the carboxylic acids of triamcinolone acetonide and fluticasone propionate were analyzed in separate incubation experiments as shown in fig 3 both tested carboxylic acid tps were not degraded at all during the incubation periods and further expected transformation reaction such as hydrogenations or side chain degradation were not observed therefore these results indicate a persistent behavior of the carboxylic tps in biological wastewater treatment 3 2 4 betamethasone and beclomethasone the structural characteristic of betamethasone and its related steroids is the 9α halo moiety e g dexamethasone flumethasone and beclomethasone betamethasone 9α fluoro and beclomethasone 9α chloro were selected as initial substances for tracking the fate during biodegradation since both gcs are in widespread use in germany the time courses of tp formation and the tentative pathway of the observed betamethasone biotransformation in activated sludge are shown in fig 4 the proposed degradation pathway of beclomethasone dipropionate is illustrated in fig 5 detailed information to the verified or proposed tps is provided in the supporting information during the incubation experiments of both gcs the formation of four similar tps has been detected betamethasone tp332 tp348a tp412 and tp414 beclomethasone tp348b tp364 tp428 and tp430 thus comparable degradation pathways were identified for betamethasone and beclomethasone the biodegradation of betamethasone revealed the formation of 17 oxo betamethasone oxobms whose retention time and ms2 matched that of an authentic reference standard however 17 oxo betamethasone was detected to a minor extent fig 4 a but appreciable quantities were found for an isomeric tp tp332 for beclomethasone an analogic tp tp348b was formed both tp332 and tp348b were identified as the major tps formed during the biodegradation of the analyzed betamethasone and beclomethasone derivatives the comparison of the ms2 spectra of 17 oxo betamethasone and tp332 revealed a high structural similarity since fragmentation pattern for both compounds were comparable si fig s2 however the rt shift between tp332 and 17 oxo betamethasone δrt 3 1 min suggested a more polar compound and thus a 17β hydroxy 6 7 dehydro derivative was tentatively proposed for tp332 and tp348b as the most plausible structure whereas the exact position of the carbon double bond could not been determined since reference standards of these tps were not commercially available for confirmation of the rt shift between 17β hydroxy and 17 oxo steroids two commercially available steroid pairs estrone 17β estradiol and androstenedione testosterone were analyzed under the same chromatographic conditions data not shown the rt shifts were found to be similar to those for tp332 and oxobms which supported the proposed 17β hydroxyl moiety of tp332 and tp348b for further insights 17 oxo betamethasone was spiked as the initial compound in a separate experiment a fast and nearly complete enzymatically mediated isomerization to tp332 fig 4 b was found revealing the 17 oxo tps as intermediates in the biodegradation of betamethasone and related gcs such behavior was not observed for the ketal steroids clobetasol propionate and fluticasone propionate therefore it is likely that the 17α hydroxyl group is crucial as a reactive site for the transformation since in all these gcs the 17α hydroxyl group is protected and the side chain degradation has not been observed on the other hand steric effects of the 17α substituents might be responsible for the inhibition of the side chain cleavage the enzymatic conversion of the steroid side chain to yield 17 oxo and 17β hydroxy steroids was proposed to occur in the biodegradation of hydrocortisone wang et al 2018 and progesterone yu et al 2018 this transformation is an important reaction in the biosynthesis of androgens in mammals which is catalyzed by cytochrome p450 17a1 yoshimoto and auchus 2015 on the other hand the reversible reduction of the steroid 17 oxo moiety constitutes an important control mechanism for nuclear receptor ligands lukacik et al 2006 for example the enzymatic conversion of estrone to 17β estradiol khanal et al 2006 and androstenedione to testosterone bhatti and kehra 2012 regulates the ratio of the active 17β hydroxy steroid and the less active 17 oxo analogue in the endogenous endocrine system in humans nevertheless tp332 and tp348b were degraded to tp348a tp of betamethasone and tp364 tp of beclomethasone which were tentatively proposed as hydroxylated derivatives for both gcs the amount of their formation was below 15 according to previous studies the hydroxyl group was suspected to be at ring b since hydroxylation of steroids in the human metabolism revealed usually c6 hydroxylated products butler and gray 1970 during further incubation tp412 and tp414 tps of betamethasone as well as tp428 and tp430 analogic tps of beclomethasone were formed and could be identified as o sulfated tps the ms2 spectra of the tps clearly indicated the presence of aliphatic sulfate conjugates si fig s1 sulfation is a known enzymatic reaction of hydroxylic moieties occurring in biological wastewater treatment as reported in el sharkawy et al 1991 and jewell et al 2015 in contrast to the analogy of the biodegradation of betamethasone and beclomethasone the beclomethasone derivatives were found to undergo intramolecular epoxidations between the c9 and c11 position which led to the formation of three epoxy tps tp428a tp428b and tp372 these epoxy tps could be unambiguously confirmed via authentic reference standards and their formation was observed in the sterile control as well the epoxidation of chlorohydrins trans 1 chloro 2 hydroxy hydrocarbons can be enzymatically catalyzed fauzi et al 1996 or be promoted by alkaline conditions such intramolecular epoxidation was not observed for 9α fluoro steroids since fluorine is not a good leaving group due to its elevated basicity 3 2 5 hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of steroid ring a the regulation of the steroid activity in humans is often coupled to hydrogenation dehydrogenation of carbon bonds in steroid ring a hanukoglu 1992 for instance the weak androgen testosterone is activated by the enzyme 5α reductase and leads to the formation of the potent androgen 5α dihydro testosterone dht moreover the δ1 dehydrogenation dehydrogenation between c1 and c2 is associated to the four fold enhancement of the gc activity of prednisolone in comparison to hydrocortisone mutschler 1997 on the other hand hydrogenation can also lead to an increased affinity to other steroid receptors as it was previously reported for norethisterone and its hydrogenated metabolites larrea et al 2001 therefore the steroid activity is impacted by the presence and position of double bonds in this study hydrogenation of the carbon double bond at position c4 and c5 δ4 hydrogenation was identified as the primary transformation reaction of several gcs and was identified for budesonide clobetasol propionate fluticasone propionate fluocinolone acetonide and triamcinolone acetonide si table s3 fig s1 in addition the formation of two hydrogenated tp isomers δ1 and δ4 dihydro was detected for budesonide fluocinolone acetonide and fluticasone propionate although one tp was in all cases dominant the comparison with authentic reference standards of the corresponding 1 2 dihydro compounds confirmed that the δ1 hydrogenated tps 1 2 dihydro were formed to a minor extent since both isomers could be clearly distinguished by their rts it should be noted that the δ4 hydrogenated tps 4 5 dihydro were not commercially available for reference however the ms2 spectra showed considerable similarities ms2 spectra are provided in the si and the reduction of the 3 oxo moiety could be excluded since all tps showed a positive rt shift in comparison to their parent gcs when 1 2 dihydro fluticasone propionate tp502b was incubated as the initial compound the formation of appreciable amounts of fluticasone propionate and the δ4 dihydro tp tp502a were detected in other words δ1 dehydrogenation of tp502b results in the formation of fluticasone propionate which was then further converted to tp502a via δ4 hydrogenation a similar behavior was noted during the incubation of 1 2 dihydro clobetasol propionate and hydrocortisone was found to be converted to prednisolone which is the δ1 dehydro derivative of hydrocortisone the time courses of the tp formation for the fluticasone propionate and the 1 2 dihydro fluticasone propionate tp502b experiments are illustrated in fig 6 c and d chromatographic separation of the hydrogenated tps is shown exemplarily for the incubation of 1 2 dihydro fluticasone propionate tp502b in fig 6 a as δ4 hydrogenation of fluticasone propionate leads to the formation of tp502a while δ4 hydrogenation of 1 2 dihydro fluticasone propionate tp502b yields tp504 the tetra hydrogenated derivative δ4 hydrogenation seems to be the dominant reaction in both experiments the main tp was the product of the enzymatic reduction of the c4 c5 double bond the preferred formation of 4 5 dihydro fluticasone propionate tp502a suggest therefore strong regioselectivity of the enzymatic hydrogenation and was likewise noted for other gcs in this study on the other hand 1 2 hydrogenated steroids showed a considerable level of δ1 dehydrogenation the enzymatically mediated δ1 dehydrogenation was previously reported during the biodegradation of progesterone yu et al 2018 and hydrocortisone bredehöft et al 2012 and seems to be a prevalent transformation reaction of 3 on 4 ene steroids the hydrogenation of the double bond at c4 and c5 δ4 hydrogenation can yield 5α or 5β hydrogenated tps and thus to a significant change in the geometry of the steroid core as the results indicated the formation of one major δ4 hydrogenated tp for a broad range of gcs it can be expected that the enzymatic δ4 hydrogenation is stereospecific although an identification of the stereochemistry was impossible due to the missing reference materials these hypotheses need to be addressed in further research finally a proposal of a general scheme of the favored sites and reactions was derived and illustrated in fig 7 since the evaluation of the detected tps revealed a strong regio and stereoselectivity of the transformation reactions during the incubation of gcs with activated sludge 3 3 occurrence of glucocorticoids and tps in wwtp effluents the occurrence of the target gcs and tps was investigated in eight german wwtps equipped with conventional biological treatment units for quantification the previously reported method was optimized for the tps weizel et al 2018 details of the applied analytical method si table s4 results of the analyzed wwtp effluents si table s5 figs s4 s6 and detailed sample information si table s2 can be found in the supporting information in order to estimate the transferability of the insights of the degradation study tps were proposed for mometasone furoate tp 9 11 epoxy mometasone furoate and 6β hydroxy triamcinolone acetonide 6β hydroxy 21 oic triamcinolone acetonide both parent compounds were not considered in the experiments mentioned above but were recently detected at elevated concentrations in wwtp effluents weizel et al 2018 thus the probability of detecting them was given as shown in table 4 six of the 13 parent gcs were detected in all wwtp effluents the highest concentrations were found for triamcinolone acetonide up to 20 ng l 1 followed by clobetasol propionate up to 3 8 ng l 1 the betamethasone monoesters up to 3 1 ng l 1 and mometasone furoate up to 1 9 ng l 1 respectively moreover 11 tps could be detected and quantified via their calibration standards table 4 all of the analyzed wwtp effluents contained the carboxylic acid tps of triamcinolone acetonide tp448 its metabolite 6β hydroxy triamcinolone acetonide and fluticasone propionate tp458 the concentration of tp458 was in all cases higher than its parent gc fluticasone propionate with a maximum concentration of 2 8 ng l 1 the results therefore indicate that these carboxylic acid tps are widely present in wwtp effluents and thus discharged in rivers and streams it has to be noted that these tps are also discharged into the wwtps by domestic wastewater since they are human metabolites argenti et al 2013 pearce et al 2006 although carboxy tps are rather inactive gc receptor agonists in comparison to the parent steroids johnson et al 1998 further research is recommended to rule out a possible adverse effect to waterborne organisms by cross receptor affinities furthermore the sampling campaign revealed the ubiquitous occurrence of the betamethasone monoesters betamethasone 17 valerate was detected from 0 6 to 3 1 ng l 1 and the 21 valerate ranged from 0 4 to 1 1 ng l 1 table 4 in addition betamethasone 17 propionate 0 6 1 6 ng l 1 and 21 propionate 0 5 1 3 ng l 1 were frequently detected in the analyzed wwtp effluents since these monoesters are predicted to be precursors of betamethasone the exclusion of such gcs leads to a considerable underestimation of the overall concentration of betamethasone not least because gc mixtures induce additive effects willi et al 2019 the secondary betamethasone tps 17 oxo betamethasone and tp332 could be detected in two and three wwtp effluents respectively 17 oxo and 17 hydroxy steroids are known to trigger the androgen receptor thus the tps could contribute to residual bioactivities in wwtp effluents as was recently reported houtman et al 2018 moreover the conjugated tp of 17 oxo betamethasone tp412 was found in all wwtp effluents si fig s4 since conjugation of steroids is a reversible process tp412 can be assumed to be a precursor of tp332 cwiertny et al 2014 however due to the missing reference standard for tp412 its quantification was not possible on the other hand the hydrogenated tps were all below the limit of quantification loq it can be assumed that the average hydraulic retention time in the biological treatment compartments is not high enough for the extensive generation of hydrogenated tps and thus the concentrations of tps may be too low for analytical detection nevertheless the analysis of the grab samples revealed the presence of several of the newly identified tps in wwtp effluents monitoring campaigns of daily composite samples could be valuable for mass balance analysis and give greater insights into the occurrence of gcs and their tps in such engineered systems for microbiological wastewater treatment 4 conclusions the range of investigated compounds enabled new insights into the biodegradation process of gcs together with the elucidation of tps and transformation reactions the results allowed the following conclusions the spectrum of the analyzed gcs showed a pronounced variability in aerobic degradation in this context structural features that led to a distinct increase in stability could be characterized thus on the basis of the current results the bio degradability of gcs in biological wastewater treatment can be predicted by means of the chemical structure also the results from previous studies can be better interpreted as this shows that the higher stability primarily leads to the glucocorticoid burden in the environment and not exclusively the consumption pattern steroid hormones in general are considered as biodegradable within the group of gcs the results highlights that certain synthetic steroids are recalcitrant in aerobic wastewater processes especially triamcinolone acetonide and further ketal steroids therefore there is a strong need for efficient removal strategies in particular for persistent hormones with elevated potencies within the identified tps the carboxylic acids of fluticasone propionate and triamcinolone acetonide were found to be persistent and as a consequence they were detected in all wwtp effluents also ester isomerization of c17 monoester gcs 6α methylprednisolone propionate beclomethasone propionate betamethasone propionate betamethasone valerate needs to be considered for monitoring since both esters c17 monoesters and c21 monoesters were present in treated wastewater at elevated concentrations contrarily to their diesters in addition the determined transformation reactions were successfully transferred to other gcs which could then be detected in the effluents of several wwtps therefore the identified tps emphasize that similar structural moieties lead to equivalent biotransformation and thus similar tps are generated tracking the main tps is seen as important because for many of the occurring tps endocrine activity cannot be ruled out the tps might therefore significantly contribute to the residual endocrine activities in the aquatic
