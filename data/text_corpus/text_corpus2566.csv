12830,benzophenone 3 bp 3 fipronil fip and propylparaben ppb are chemical compounds classified as contaminants of emerging concern cec and known as refractory to natural biological degradation and conventional water treatments their occurrence in aqueous matrices is threatening to ecosystems making it necessary to implement efficient technologies for their elimination from these matrices advanced oxidation processes aops have been suggested as complementary tertiary treatments in municipal wastewater treatment plants aiming at cec degradation this review provides a timely overview of different aops reported for bp 3 fip and ppb degradation to give a complete picture of current knowledge regarding their removal from aqueous matrices recent progresses on circumventing negative effects of operational parameters were also surveyed and contrasted the involvement of green chemistry more exactly sustainable chemistry practices in these processes evidenced by the use of red mud for persulfate activation is an important step forward however low degradation rates 48 achieved in real matrices continue to be a challenge for aops performance in real scale in addition published studies point out to successful degradation of target cec with the formation of less toxic transformation products for bp 3 and ppb finally the current status of these processes regarding new developments and applications of aops is presented along with merits and limitations graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords contaminants of emerging concern environmental aqueous matrices fenton ozonation transformation products ultrasound 1 introduction in recent years there has been serious environmental concern associated to the frequent detection of contaminants of emerging concern cec in aqueous matrices with emphasis on pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps and pesticides 1 the detection of these cec at trace levels specifically benzophenone 3 bp 3 fipronil fip and propylparaben ppb has also increased 2 6 bp 3 was detected in outdoor swimming pool water 7 8 and surface water 9 at concentration levels up to hundreds of ng l 1 fip was detected in concentrations that exceed established reference value to preserve aquatic life c a 11 ng l 1 by 46 in california surface waters 148 70 in u s streams and rivers 149 and by 20 in agricultural multi use streams in the usa 149 ppb has been recognized for its constant presence in water at concentrations levels ranging from ng l 1 to Î¼g l 1 4 6 150 which are known to affect aquatic biota 13 14 there are several sources of these contaminants to aquatic compartments 1 such as i discharge of domestic and industrial effluents ii disposal of expired or unused pesticides and pharmaceutical products and iii application of sludge from municipal wastewater treatment plants mwwtp in agricultural fields with subsequent runoff to surface water disposal and inadequate treatment of waste containing bp 3 fip and ppb impact biotic and abiotic components of ecosystems 15 17 bp 3 is one of the most widely used uv filters and exposure to high levels of this compound during critical growth periods of the marine diatom chaetoceros gracilis may cause endocrine alterations to these species 18 some harmful effects reported for bp 3 in aquatic organisms include a effects on reproduction and signaling of sex hormones thus damaging egg production and incubation and reducing testosterone and negative regulation of steroidogenic genes in fish 19 20 b inhibition of growth development and reproduction on the benthic insect chironomus riparius 21 22 and c coral discoloration 23 fip is used to control fleas and ticks in pets and its occurrence in mwwtp effluents discharged to the environment has been identified as a potential toxicity factor to aquatic invertebrates 16 ppb is widely applied in the formulation of personal care products due to its preservative action thus showing antimicrobial activity 151 this compound may affect human health due to its endocrine disrupting activity 17 furthermore long term use of ppb has been associated with breast cancer 13 152 studies evaluating alternatives for the treatment of aqueous matrices containing bp 3 fip and ppb deserve special attention as these compounds are hazardous to ecosystem integrity advanced oxidation processes aops based on the generation of highly reactive hydroxyl ho and sulfate so4 radicals 26 27 have been identified as effective technologies for the degradation of cecs in different aqueous matrices in contrast studies evaluating the application of these processes for the degradation of these three compounds are scarce fig 1a and more than half were carried out in deionized water fig 1b this strongly justifies the need for a structured review on the main findings from these few studies a search on scientific databases pointed out to a total of 62 scientific publications on aops applied either for individual or simultaneous degradation of bp 3 fip and ppb in aqueous matrices figs 1a and 2 the lowest number of publications 13 publications is associated to fip fig 2 however considering only the studies in real matrices the number of publications for this compound is in the order of 36 against 32 for the other two compounds bp 3 and ppb fig 2 interestingly to the best of our knowledge there is no study reporting simultaneous degradation of all three target compounds or at least two of them this gap reinforces the need for this critical review recent and relevant review papers have compiled results concerning the degradation of parabens 29 30 153 and fip 31 in aqueous matrices with a focus on photocatalysis aimed at the development of efficient photocatalytic semiconductor materials some authors have extended their review beyond photocatalysis 32 33 and focused on the classical operating principles of these aops while compiling degradation results on paraben however to the best of our knowledge no review papers including reports of aops for sunscreen especially bp 3 degradation have been published yet this is the first critical review of the current literature focusing exclusively on aops reported either for single or simultaneous degradation of bp 3 fip and ppb in aqueous matrices with emphasis on real matrices while aiming at the evaluation of operational parameters toxicity changes and degradation pathways which lead to the main transformation products tps the main goal of this review is to highlight the advantages of innovative strategies arising from adaptation of operational parameters in each reviewed aop in order to achieve satisfactory degradation efficiencies and reduced toxicity among these strategies the following stand out i replacement of iron salts by organic iron complexes in the conventional photo fenton process aiming at handling the treatment at the natural ph of real aqueous matrices ii the effect of the relationship between light source and catalyst film thickness on photocatalytic properties iii use of apparently useless natural material or waste in example red mud as alternative persulfate activators furthermore this review provides clarity for the choice of the most eco friendly photocatalysts as photocatalytic properties of tio2 based and non tio2 based photocatalysts are compared as a function of required dosages and toxicity of tio2 and zno nanoparticles to aquatic ecosystems and human health overall this critical review provides an in depth discussion regarding the new development and use of aops as well as their merits and limitations on the degradation of target cec comparison and discussion of the intricacies of various aops and prediction of future areas for their application justify the relevance of this review in terms of reviewed literature the study focused on research published in the past ten years however older papers which had an important impact and contributions to the research progress were also included to the present review the choice of bp 3 fip and ppb as target compounds was based on their widespread use occurrence in aquatic compartments at unsafe concentration levels for the environment and scarcity of studies on their treatment and removal finally this review also provides recommendations for future research on the application and improvement of aops the review is organized according to the following structure section 2 effects of operational parameters of each revised aop fenton reactions heterogeneous photocatalysis photo assisted peroxidation sulfate radicals based aops sonochemistry ozonation electrochemical oxidation photolysis of monochloramine and hypochlorite ions on the degradation of target compounds and main advances and outcomes related to each one section 3 degradation pathways and tps for each target cec as well as toxicity evolution in all treatment stages figs 3 5 section 4 concluding remarks and outlooks which provide highlights on the current integration between innovative and conventional treatment strategies while aiming to circumvent negative effects of aops operational parameters and challenges associated to the removal of bp 3 fip and ppb in real matrices 2 advanced oxidation processes aops 2 1 fenton reactions the fenton process is characterized by the generation of ho radicals through catalytic decomposition of h2o2 in the presence of fe2 ions at acid medium eq 1 34 146 the reaction between fe3 and h2o2 represents one of the main fenton reaction mechanisms and occurs slowly in the dark k 9 1 10 7 mol l 1 s 1 one of the alternatives to accelerate this reaction is through exposition to uv vis radiation known as the photo fenton process 36 incidence of uv vis radiation on fe iii aquo complexes eq 2 promotes transfer of the ligand metal charge which implies on the reduction of fe iii to fe ii and oxidation of the ligand thus generating ho radical 1 fe 2 h 2 o 2 fe 3 ho ho k 76 l mol 1 s 1 2 fe oh 2 hv fe 2 ho fenton reaction reached satisfactory degradation of bp 3 fip and ppb 37 42 table 1 shows removal rates and percent reductions on dissolved organic carbon doc and chemical oxygen demand cod obtained by this process in various water matrices bp 3 was completely degraded by photo fenton in deionized water 37 and by photoelectro fenton in mwwtp effluent 41 mineralization levels above 60 in water were reached after 300 min of photo fenton at ph 3 37 despite incomplete mineralization of bp 3 in deionized water 37 organic content remained in the matrix thus indicating the formation of highly stable tps a similar behavior was observed during the degradation of fip in industrial wastewater via photo fenton at ph 2 9 reaching 60 and 75 removals of doc and cod respectively 38 treatment of industrial water a much more complex matrix than previously mentioned studies containing high levels of fip required the integration of coagulation flocculation settling processes that allowed for toxicity reduction and increased biodegradability in contrast 63 degradation of ppb was obtained after a longer treatment time 180 min in deionized water and at ph 5 7 39 limited degradation rate 70 is justified by iron precipitation in the form of insoluble hydroxides at ph 3 0 thus drastically decreasing its interaction with h2o2 and consequently reducing the production of ho radicals considering that the natural ph of environmental aqueous matrices is close to neutrality 42 44 acidification and neutralization are required respectively before and after treatment thus increasing treatment cost and time and making the application of photo fenton at acidic ph unlikely in real aqueous matrices photo fenton process at neutral ph is enabled by the introduction of organic iron complexes that allow for dissolved iron availability over a broad ph range 45 furthermore iron complexes contribute to increasing light absorption efficiency as they extend the absorption band to the visible region 46 47 photolysis of these iron complexes leads to the formation of fe2 eq 1 thus improving the efficiency of the photo fenton process 45 48 3 fe 3 l aq hÎ½ fe 3 l aq fe 2 aq l aq different organic iron ligands oxalate ox citrate cit nitrilotriacetic acid nta ethylene diaminetetraacetic acid edta and ethylenediamine n n succinic edds have been reported as efficient for the treatment of various aqueous matrices containing cecs 44 48 54 when fe iii is dissolved in aqueous solutions in the presence of one of the aforementioned ligands soluble compounds containing fe iii are formed at ph 3 0 45 understanding the speciation of organic iron complexes as a function of ph is extremely important for choosing the complex to be used in the degradation process for each matrix for instance edta forms soluble complexes without fe iii precipitation up to basic ph values fig 1a while cit nta ox and edds make fe iii available until almost neutral ph by forming soluble complexes fig 3c f solar photo fenton conducted at ph 6 0 led to 83 fip degradation in mwwtp effluent in the presence of fe cit complex at 1 3 m ratio 42 in this context a previous study evaluated the performance of fecit and feox species for fip degradation in distilled water fig 4 best results were obtained with fecit compared to feox fig 4 due to higher solubility of iron citrate complexes compared to iron oxalate complexes which agrees with speciation diagrams shown in fig 3b and 3d these results show that the adaptation of the photo fenton process by using fecit complex may be a viable alternative to prevent the precipitation of iron in natural water matrices during fip degradation in addition an improvement in fip degradation occurred when fe cit molar ratios increased from 1 1 to 1 3 fig 4a and feox from 1 3 to 1 6 fig 4b yet this was not observed for higher molar ratios these results demonstrate the importance of optimizing iron ligand molar ratios for each complex and matrix to avoid simultaneous iron precipitation and competition of the ligand for hydroxyl radicals thus maximizing the degradation efficiency fig 4 the use of fecit complexes is also interesting considering that effluents from some production processes may be used as alternative sources of cit thus increasing processes sustainability 55 although maximum fip degradation loq 17 Î¼g l 1 was obtained in distilled water 42 this result is associated to the absence of inorganic ions and natural organic matter in this matrix the competitive action of some inorganic ions chloride sulfate phosphate carbonate and bicarbonate present in real environmental matrices constitutes one of the main limitations for the application of aops in real matrices since they act as scavengers of ho radicals and or absorb or scatter light 56 thus reducing removal efficiency the fenton reaction has also been adapted to electrochemical aops i e photoelectron fenton process which are characterized by continuous in situ generation of h2o2 by electrochemical reduction of o2 in the cathode and continuous supply of fe ii which allows for the formation of ho radicals photoelectron fenton has been highlighted as an emerging technology in the context of aops 27 57 the merits of the photoelectron fenton process also include the involvement of other processes such as adsorption anodic oxidation and flocculation 57 bp 3 was completely degraded in mwwtp effluent after 20 min of treatment by photoelectron fenton 41 according to outcomes highlighted in this section different adaptations to the fenton reaction have been successfully applied for the degradation of bp 3 fip and ppb effective treatment in real applications is still a challenge due to ph limitations and natural matrix constituents therefore strategies aimed at increasing treatment effectiveness at circumneutral ph natural ph for most industrial and mwwtp effluents such as the use of organic iron complexes should be encouraged furthermore the use of solar radiation 42 and the search for innovative and selective oxidants are crucial to reduce energy costs and to circumvent the competitive action of inorganic ions present in the matrix 2 2 heterogeneous photocatalysis heterogeneous photocatalysis is based on the electronic excitation of a semiconductor oxide in the presence of artificial or solar radiation to generate hydroxyl radicals capable of oxidizing natural organic matter 58 and also cec present in water matrices several semiconductors have been used in heterogeneous photocatalysis such as fe2o3 zno zns cds and tio2 59 when a semiconductor is bombarded with photons electrons in the valence band vb are transferred to the conduction band cb leaving positive holes h eq 4 60 which react with water or hydroxyl groups adsorbed on the semiconductor surface and finally generating ho radicals eqs 5 and 6 besides the h has a high standard reduction potential 2 0 to 3 5 v and can also oxidize target contaminants 61 62 the photon energy needed to generate an electron gap pair must be equal to or greater than that of the gap 60 electrons present in the cb freely or trapped on its surface reduce the adsorbed o2 forming the superoxide anion radical o2 eq 7 and reducing the probability of recombination of the electron gap pair 63 the superoxide radical is highly oxidizing and generates new radical forms 62 leading to mineralization of organic pollutants adsorbed on the semiconductor surface 64 4 semiconductor hÎ½ semiconductor h vb e cb 5 h h 2 o ads ho h 6 h ho ads ho 7 e o 2 o 2 furthermore photocatalytic degradation efficiency is influenced by total irradiated energy absorbed by the suspended catalyst absorbed energy depends on the optical properties of each photocatalyst scattering and absorption coefficients photocatalytic oxidation of fip in drinking water was performed using zno and tio2 as catalysts under solar and artificial irradiation 65 the addition of na2s2o8 section 2 4 was relevant to improve fip degradation efficiency 65 catalyst concentrations required to reach the same rate of energy absorption during the process were equivalent to 200 mg l 1 for zno and 53 mg l 1 for tio2 65 however toxic effects including alteration of intracellular ca2 flux generation of reactive oxygen species membrane damage and mitochondrial dysfunction were detected in the presence of zno nanoparticles 66 besides tio2 and zno nanoparticles were harmful to gram positive bacillus subtilis and gram negative escherichia coli organisms and antibacterial activity was higher for zno compared to tio2 67 despite high degradation efficiencies using any of the tested oxides zno 99 2 tio2 98 5 table 2 a lower concentration of tio2 is required 53 mg l 1 when compared to zno 200 mg l 1 thus tio2 represents lower environmental impact this underlines from an environmental point view the relevance of a deep understanding regarding optical properties of photocatalysts still toxicity associated to tio2 nanoparticles and other catalysts must be further investigated 68 still concerning heterogeneous photocatalysis it is important to highlight the merit of monolithic cellulose acetate structures coated with commercial films of catalyst nanoparticles these structures can be arranged in different geometries to obtain a larger area of illuminated catalyst per reactor volume in addition they contain a large number of walls in which photocatalyst nanoparticles are deposited thus providing a high area volume ratio 9 evidently high bp 3 degradation efficiencies 95 were achieved using supported catalyst monolithic structures coated with p25 9 besides an increase in the number of thin layers of immobilized tio2 p25 on the outer walls of the monolithic cellulose acetate structure from 1 to 3 led to a decrease in half life time t1 2 required for bp 3 degradation from 13 to 6 min and resulted in maximum degradation efficiency equivalent to 91 within 30 min of irradiation 9 this result was obtained by the frontal lighting mechanism during which an increase in the thickness of the catalyst film increases the generation of charge carriers to the point where the light is completely absorbed by the catalyst layer 69 the addition of 20 mg l 1 h2o2 to the tio2 p25 uv a system treating real swimming pool water reached bp 3 concentration below the detection limit lod 0 20 Î¼g l 1 within 6 min of irradiation with a consumption of 22 of the initial h2o2 concentration 9 this synergistic effect was also observed for ppb degradation 70 the addition of h2o2 to the photocatalytic system prevents electron hole recombination by accepting photogenerated electrons from the cb and allows for the production of additional ho the work also evaluated the effect of water matrix composition upon ppb degradation and treatment efficiency decreased in the presence of higher concentrations of organic matter as follows ultrapure water reservoir water river water wastewater this fact was justified by the competition between natural organic matter and target pollutant for ho and also by the scavenging action of po4 3 and hco3 species 70 2 2 1 photocatalyst reusability and separation although photocatalyst suspensions are efficient for secondary wastewater quality improvement separation of catalyst from solution after treatment and its reusability are some of the main drawbacks associated the application of photocatalysis in real scale catalyst recovery may be enhanced through charge neutralization and coagulation with electrolytes 71 73 regarding tio2 its isoelectric point or point of zero charge phpzc 6 4 6 6 74 is close to ph 7 73 at this ph value tio2 particle surface is mainly occupied by neutral groups tioh and a small amount of charged species tio tioh2 thus reducing electrostatic repulsion between tio2 particles 71 electrolytes present in the aqueous matrix neutralize charged species and reduce the thickness of the electrochemical double layer of the particles thus resulting in lower repulsion between particles and promoting coagulation 71 75 therefore sedimentation rates and the hydrodynamic diameter of tio2 particles are maximum at the isoelectric point ph of natural water matrices 73 which can be adequate for full scale application besides metal free photocatalysts may be adapted for recycling and reuse a recent progress consisted in the preparation of graphitic carbon nitride hydrogel microspheres with cross linking reactions between sodium alginate and calcium ions this material is separation free from the liquid phase for reuse 76 the potential of calcium alginate lies in its hydroxyl that allows for increased adsorption of organic pollutants as well as increased transfer and separation of photogenerated charge carriers 76 however studies on real wastewater are still needed to consolidate progress on the separation and reuse of metal free photocatalysts 2 2 2 ph effect on photocatalytic degradation of bp 3 fip and ppb although the effect of ph in the photocatalytic reaction is generally attributed to the surface charge of the semiconductor 65 knowledge about the speciation of target molecules fig s1 as a function of ph is also relevant to predict the effect of ph in this type of process a negligible adsorption of bp 3 on the surface of photocatalysts tio2 p25 phzpc 6 25 77 tio2 pc500 phzpc 6 05 78 and tio2 pc105 phzpc 3 83 79 was observed at ph 7 0 9 although bp 3 molecule has only one pka 9 65 80 its neutral form prevails at ph 7 0 fig s1a which is the usual ph associated to natural waters considering the aforementioned phzpc values for tio2 structures tio2 p25 and tio2 pc500 surfaces are predominantly neutral tioh at ph 7 while tio2 pc105 surface is negatively charged tio under the same conditions thus electrostatic repulsion or no electrostatic interaction are expected to occur between catalyst surface and bp 3 molecule at ph 7 0 9 although the effect of ph in the photocatalytic reaction is generally attributed to the surface charge of the semiconductor 65 knowledge about the speciation of target molecules fig s1 as a function of ph is also relevant to predict the effect of ph in this type of process a negligible adsorption of bp 3 on the surface of photocatalysts tio2 p25 phzpc 6 25 77 tio2 pc500 phzpc 6 05 78 and tio2 pc105 phzpc 3 83 79 was observed at ph 7 0 9 although bp 3 molecule has only one pka 9 65 80 its neutral form prevails at ph 7 0 fig s1a which is the usual ph associated to natural waters considering the aforementioned phzpc values for tio2 structures tio2 p25 and tio2 pc500 surfaces are predominantly neutral tioh at ph 7 while tio2 pc105 surface is negatively charged tio under the same conditions thus electrostatic repulsion or no electrostatic interaction are expected to occur between catalyst surface and bp 3 molecule at ph 7 0 9 fenol et al 65 studied the influence of initial ph 7 1 on the kinetics of photocatalytic degradation of fip using tio2 phpzc 6 0 and zno phpzc 9 0 fip is neutral over a wide ph range fig s1b the surface of tio2 and zno are predominantly positively charged below phs 6 0 and 9 0 respectively and negatively charged above these values hence electrostatic attraction or repulsion between fip and the catalysts occurred in the reference study resulting respectively in increase or inhibition of fip photodegradation rate since ph values ranging from 6 0 to 8 0 produce a negligible effect on tio2 and zno photocatalytic treatment can be successfully carried out at an initial ph around 7 0 65 it is worth mentioning that zno may react with a base to form zn oh 2 at a basic ph this increases toxicity due to the generation of zn2 in the solution 65 as it is bioavailable to aquatic biota thus its application for the treatment of real matrices prior to discharge must be supported by toxicity studies fenol et al 65 studied the influence of initial ph 7 1 on the kinetics of photocatalytic degradation of fip using tio2 phpzc 6 0 and zno phpzc 9 0 fip is neutral over a wide ph range fig s1b the surface of tio2 and zno are predominantly positively charged below phs 6 0 and 9 0 respectively and negatively charged above these values hence electrostatic attraction or

basic ph this increases toxicity due to the generation of zn2 in the solution 65 as it is bioavailable to aquatic biota thus its application for the treatment of real matrices prior to discharge must be supported by toxicity studies the adsorption of ppb is more efficient in acidic and neutral media than in basic media fang et al 81 observed a rapid decrease in ppb degradation efficiency when ph was increased from 3 0 to 11 0 as the pka of ppb is equivalent to 8 24 81 it tends to occur mainly in the neutral form in environmental waters showing a small dissociation so it may be adsorbed onto tio2 surface which holds a positive charge below the phpzc 6 2 81 furthermore further increase in the ph to values above 8 24 led to ppb transformation to its anionic form fig s1c which is hardly adsorbed by the negatively charged tio2 thus decreasing the degradation efficiencies it is noteworthy that basic conditions can drastically increase the formation of the phenoxyl radical from ppb which can react with hydrated electrons e aq to regenerate the original compound 81 82 decreasing ppb degradation efficiency furthermore decreased degradation efficiency at high ph values may also result from the transformation of ho radical pka 11 9 into a less reactive oxide radical ion o 83 similar decrease in photocatalytic degradation of metronidazole mz 84 85 and tetracycline tc 86 in the order of 50 80 were observed when ph values of respective solutions were adjusted from 3 0 to 9 0 and from 3 0 to 11 0 therefore at basic ph 9 0 and 11 0 there was repulsion between negatively charged photocatalysts ag d nzf 85 and mnfe ldo biochar 84 86 and anionic species of the target compounds mz and tc 84 86 the adsorption of ppb is more efficient in acidic and neutral media than in basic media fang et al 81 observed a rapid decrease in ppb degradation efficiency when ph was increased from 3 0 to 11 0 as the pka of ppb is equivalent to 8 24 81 it tends to occur mainly in the neutral form in environmental waters showing a small dissociation so it may be adsorbed onto tio2 surface which holds a positive charge below the phpzc 6 2 81 furthermore further increase in the ph to values

conditions can drastically increase the formation of the phenoxyl radical from ppb which can react with hydrated electrons e aq to regenerate the original compound 81 82 decreasing ppb degradation efficiency furthermore decreased degradation efficiency at high ph values may also result from the transformation of ho radical pka 11 9 into a less reactive oxide radical ion o 83 similar decrease in photocatalytic degradation of metronidazole mz 84 85 and tetracycline tc 86 in the order of 50 80 were observed when ph values of respective solutions were adjusted from 3 0 to 9 0 and from 3 0 to 11 0 therefore at basic ph 9 0 and 11 0 there was repulsion between negatively charged photocatalysts ag d nzf 85 and mnfe ldo biochar 84 86 and anionic species of the target compounds mz and tc 84 86 considering the intrinsic relationship between alkalinity and ph it is also important to underline that alkalinity exerts a significant inhibitory effect on the process as it blocks active sites on the photocatalyst surface by high concentrations of organic matter 70 therefore the application of these processes in alkaline waters may not be efficient for the removal of target compounds 2 3 photo assisted peroxidation the exposition of h2o2 to uv c radiation generates ho radicals through the homolytic cleavage of h2o2 thus increasing efficiency of cec degradation when compared to uv c radiation alone eq 8 87 88 147 in general h2o2 photolysis is performed under low or medium pressure mercury vapor lamps 254 nm however high concentrations of h2o2 were necessary to reach satisfactory degradation efficiencies at 254 nm due to the low absorptivity of this oxidant in this spectral region Îµ254 18 6 l mol 1 cm 1 90 xenon doped mercury lamp emitting in the range between 210 and 240 nm may be used as an alternative despite increased costs associated to this lamp 90 uv c photolysis provided limited bp 3 degradation efficiency with degradation yields between 20 and 60 after 60 min of treatment in ultrapure water 91 the same radiation was also applied to different real water matrices river sea and pool and bp 3 degradation was lower in the presence of higher organic matter content in contrast uv c h2o2 system was successful on the removal 90 of 21 compounds used as uv filters with almost complete degradation of bp 3 after 20 min of irradiation in swimming pool water 91 although h2o2 photolysis is ph dependent h2o2 cleavage occurs mainly ho2 at alkaline ph it has numerous advantages over other aops such as the absence of sludge formation complete miscibility between h2o2 and water stability and commercial availability 92 in addition h2o2 has no phase transfer limitations and investment costs are low 93 8 h 2 o 2 aq hÎ½ 2ho aq table 2 shows the summary of papers regarding

s2o8 2 is used as an alternative to h2o2 in different aops such as uv c s2o8 2 and persulfate based fenton and photo fenton these systems result in the generation of so4 whose standard reduction potential 2 60 v is greater than that observed for s2o8 2 2 10 v thus allowing for the degradation of contaminants at trace concentrations 1 52 100 so4 is highly reactive and has an improved selectivity compared to ho radical as it only reacts with organic compounds through the electron transfer mechanism in contrast the ho radical reacts mainly by hydrogen abstraction 101 furthermore a greater stability is observed for sulfate radical which has a lifespan of 30 to 40 Î¼s besides so4 standard reduction potential 2 5 to 3 1 v is greater than that observed for ho radical in basic medium 1 9 v 102 103 as expected uv s2o8 2 was a better alternative for bp 3 degradation and toxicity removal in deionized water at ph 7 0 when compared to uv h2o2 94 as so4 presents higher selectivity than ho the performance of ho oxidative processes is more affected by inorganic ions and organic matter present in real waters than sr aops this is advantageous to the application of sr aops for the treatment of cec present in real matrices in this sense it is possible to obtain equivalent or better results via sulfate radical based aops 102 besides s2o8 2 may be activated by various mechanisms such as i base activation 104 ii uv 254 nm 105 and ir 455 nm 106 light iii transition metal eqs 9 and 10 107 109 and iv heat 110 9 fe 2 aq s 2 o 8 2 aq fe 3 aq so 4 aq so 4 2 aq 10 fe 2 aq

reaching 99 degradation in deionized water only the pseudo first order rate constant observed for bp 3 degradation in ultrapure water was reduced by 54 in seawater for individual systems via uv s2o8 2 this decay in treatment efficiency was associated to the conversion of ho and so4 into reactive halogenated species in seawater 99 a similar effect was observed during ppb degradation for which reaction in wastewater was 10 fold slower than in ultrapure water 112 heat transition metal ions fe2 cu2 and co2 and uv light 254 nm have also been used to activate s2o8 2 for bp 3 degradation bp 3 was completely degraded at 40 c and all tested activation methods were significantly more efficient in aqueous solution 111 furthermore results showed that fe2 has the greatest promotion effect when compared to other transition metal ions 111 this finding is supported by rastogi et al 51 who proposed iron as an environmentally friendly and economic species compared to other transition metals 90 ppb degradation in the presence of s2o8 2 and magnetite nanomaterials gives further evidence of iron effectiveness to activate persulfate 113 in addition zero valent iron was more effective for persulfate activation than artificial uv a when both activation methods were tested for ppb degradation in tap water 13 special attention must also be given to red mud as a persulfate activator in the present study since it is a natural source of metal oxides rich in fe al ti si na and cu this system was tested for ppb degradation in aqueous matrices 112 despite high ppb degradation rates obtained in deionized 99 and tap water 92 112 new strategies are required to improve aops degradation efficiency by red mud e g coupling solar or artificial radiation to the process for the treatment of real matrices since only 48 degradation table 3 was obtained in wastewater furthermore graphene was also efficient as a catalyst in the activation of sodium persulfate resulting in 95 degradation of ppb within 15 min of reaction 114 2 5 other aops 2 5 1 sonochemistry the propagation of ultrasound through a liquid leads to the generation of bubbles from gas cores in liquids and these bubbles grow and collapse through cycles of compression and rarefaction 115 during the collapse of these bubbles temperature and pressure may reach extreme values around 227 c and hundreds of atmospheres leading to the thermal dissociation of water vapor into different reactive species 115 116 this phenomenon allows for the formation of ho radicals in aqueous systems from the thermal dissociation of water vapor 116 sonochemical reactions may occur i inside the collapsing bubbles ii in the bubble liquid interfacial region where ho radicals are predominant and iii in most solutions 115 118 during sonolysis non volatile and hydrophilic compounds are oxidized by radicals at the interface of bubbles or in the solution while volatile and hydrophobic pollutants are generally pyrolyzed within bubble cavity 116 118 119 since bp3 is a non volatile compound with low water solubility its degradation occurs either in the solution or on the surface of bubbles being higher in the former as the concentration of ho radicals is higher on bubble surface acidic medium ph 2 enhances bp 3 hydrophobicity ionic fraction 8 71 10 5 thus favoring its accumulation in the interfacial region and increasing degradation rate 116 sonochemical treatment efficiency may be affected by the presence of inorganic ions and different dissolved gases as previously described anions negatively affect the performance of several aops yet no consensus has been reached on how they affect sonochemical treatments bicarbonate hco3 ion reacts with ho radicals to produce carbonate co3 radical 120 which can migrate to the bulk solution and promote pollutant degradation migration capacity is not observed for ho radicals and although the co3 radical is less reactive than the ho radical it attacks bp 3 molecules in solution 116 in contrast nitrate no3 and chloride cl ions show a scavenging effect thus competing with bp 3 for ho radicals 116 ozone treatment enhanced by ultrasound was more efficient in the degradation of bp 3 when compared to conventional ozonation 116 this is justified by the fact that ultrasound promotes the transfer of the ozone mass to the liquid and ozone also decomposes thermolytically in the vapor phase of bubbles cavity thus increasing the efficiency of ho radical formation 116 121 the presence of o2 in the ultrasonic treatment increased the degradation of bp 3 by 6 7 while n2 inhibited the degradation efficiency of the same pollutant by 18 3 116 two main reasons are pointed out for this behavior i generation of additional ho radicals by the dissociation of molecular oxygen inside the cavitation bubble 122 and ii free radical scavenging by molecular nitrogen 115 furthermore degradation by ultrasound does not require additives and no waste is generated the effect of frequency and power density on bp 3 1 0 mg l 1 degradation efficiency was analyzed and best degradation rate 98 was obtained using 574 khz and 200 w l 1 123 2 5 2 ozonation and electrochemical oxidation the principles of ozonation and electrochemical oxidation were recently reviewed 27 in ozonation ho radicals are generated through i photolysis of o3 in aqueous medium ii reaction between o3 and h2o2 in basic medium and iii reaction between o3 and oh ions present in the water 124 125 furthermore molecular ozone may react directly with dissolved contaminants through the electrophilic attack mechanism 126 the degradation of different parabens including ppb was investigated using single ozonation and various ozone combined processes in ultrapure water o3 uv tio2 h2o2 process was the most efficient in the degradation of parabens at ph 8 127 in electrochemical aops transfer of electrons or oxygen atoms may oxidize electrochemical species in aqueous solutions 128 for example in the case of a photo electron fenton process h2o2 is continuously generated in situ by electrochemical o2 reduction on the cathode and fe ii is continuously regenerated on the cathode allowing for the formation of ho radicals 27 fip degradation was evaluated in aqueous solution using advanced electrochemical oxidation and process efficiency was evaluated based on cod removal 79 chlorine 52 and fluorine reduction 52 154 a recent study has shown that a cell configuration based on solid polymer electrolyte which avoids the addition of salt to increase solution conductivity was more efficient in the degradation of parabens cod removal of 91 than the conventional system based on a boron doped diamond 81 130 2 5 3 photolysis of monochloramine and hypochlorite ion oxidants such as monochloramine and hypochlorite have been investigated and introduced in a photolytic process for the generation of hydroxyl radicals and other reactive species the combination of chlorine and uv radiation is one of the newest alternatives under investigation for the treatment of contaminated water 131 although chlorine gas is commonly used in this process monochloramine has been identified to replace as it is able to control the possible formation of disinfection by products such as trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids 132 another advantage of using chloramine in the degradation of cecs is the production of ho radicals and other reactive species changes in reaction ph can cause the conversion of monochloramine into dichloramine and trichloramine which can also be decomposed into reactive species by uv irradiation with high values of quantum yields uv irradiation of inorganic chloramines produces the chlorine radical cl 133 and monochloramine which is more stable compared to chlorine thus providing lasting residual chlorine in the reaction system 134 uv light can effectively activate hypochlorite to produce ho radicals 135 136 the optimal ph range for this process is 3 6 137 it has been found that the contribution of ho radicals for the degradation of bp3 increases at acidic ph values while reactivity of chlorine species such as cl increases at neutral and basic ph values 138 table 4 summarizes studies related to the application of aops mentioned in this section for the degradation of bp 3 fip and ppb in aqueous matrices satisfactory degradation efficiencies were achieved in most cases as most studies were carried out in deionized water table 4 hence it would be convenient to direct efforts towards the application of these techniques in real matrices 3 degradation pathways transformation products tps and toxicity identification and monitoring of tps play a key role in the degradation of cec since degradation products formed during treatment may be more toxic than target compounds therefore it is important to monitor the generation and degradation of these tps which is made possible by applying analytical techniques such as liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms ms liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry lc qtof ms and gas chromatography time of flight mass spectrometry gc qtof ms 3 1 bp 3 lee et al 138 investigated bp 3 transformation pathway under chlorination and uv chlorination chlorinated derivatives were observed in both cases as a consequence of the electrophilic substitution of one or two h atoms by chlorine a typical reaction for phenolic compounds in the uv chlorination reaction an additional oxidation reaction by ho was observed to yield the formation of hydroxylated derivatives and promote the conversion of the carbonyl group to an ester further transformation steps including the formation of halogenated methoxyphenols and chloroform were only detected during chlorination the formation of chlorinated derivatives could be responsible for toxicity increase observed in the early stages of both reactions which was lower during uv chlorination treatment thus indicating that tps generated by this process are less toxic than those produced by chlorination alone this behavior is due to additional oxidation by reactive radicals produced by uv radiation coupled to the process which results in further mineralization of bp 3 bp 3 treatment in the presence of persulfate yielded the formation of 7 main tps 111 hydroxylation of the molecule in several positions was identified as the main route fig 5a up to 4 mono di and trihidroxilated derivatives could be detected demethylation and direct oxidation reactions as well as the loss of the non substituted benzene ring were also observed ho and so4 were identified as responsible for the degradation of bp 3 by persulfate the evaluation of toxicity associated to tps by ecosar software suggested a significant decrease in toxicity after treatment in the presence of persulfate however it is important to highlight that this software considers individual tp structure to predict acute and chronic toxicity and does not enable the evaluation of effects which may be promoted by the mixture nor by the interaction between tps and other components present in environmental waters such as sulfate carbonate and other ions tps identified during sonochemical degradation of bp 3 are shown in fig 5b 123 the tp identified as 1 2 hydroxy 4 methoxyphenyl propan 1 on was generated by ho attack on the unsubstituted benzene fraction which led to ring opening the formation of benzoic acid formation was previously reported during photochemical degradation of bp3 139 via oxidation by ho acetic and formic acid also arise from the non specific attack of ho on oxidized bp 3 intermediates in this study toxicity profile decreased at the beginning of sonochemical treatment growing after 30 degradation 3 2 fip the formation of several tps has been reported to occur during fip degradation by different treatments 38 42 65 140 154 fip degradation in the environment soil sediments and water occurs by means of oxidation reduction hydrolysis and photolysis reactions to yield fip sulfone fip sulfide fip carboxamide fip desulfinyl and fip detrifluoromethylsulfinyl as main tps 141 all or part of these compounds have also been detected in mwwtp effluents 142 and during the application of aops in all cases the transformation occurs preferentially in the pyrazole ring thus indicating greater stability of the 2 6 dichloro 4 trifluoromethyl phenyl moiety fip sulfone is the main tp identified in all reported treatments 141 142 and was observed during photocatalytic degradation 65 140 and also by photo fenton process 42 the main mechanism of generation of this intermediate was oxidation 42 65 initiated by ho attack on the sulfur atom 42 recent studies 42 have evidenced the formation of new tps by photo fenton treatment of fip as shown in fig 6 the formation of these tps includes the opening of the pyrazole ring tp4 and tp6 the rupture between the pyrazole and phenyl rings tp1 and tp2 and sequential ho attacks in the amino and trifluoromethyl groups from fip desulfinyl tp5 and tp8 finally chloramination reaction of fip sulfone takes place as a consequence of the treatment with naocl in reclaimed water 142 potential risks associated to the disinfection of this by product are still unknown fip and its main tps are reported as being highly toxic for many species such as insects birds aquatic organisms among others 141 nonetheless this toxicity may be reduced or eliminated by the application of aops if treatment time and conditions are properly optimized for instance reduction of acute toxicity towards drosophila melanogaster flies by solar photo fenton was obtained ph 6 in an stp effluent 42 besides da costa filho et al 38 demonstrated a reduction in acute toxicity for a salina from 100 to 13 during the photo fenton treatment applied to an industrial effluent containing high loads of fip in contrast fip and its tps did not show significant inhibitory effect to the bioluminescence of v fischeri monitored during fip degradation by tio2 heterogeneous photocatalysis 140 thus evidencing the critical need to perform toxicity tests with organisms from different trophic levels 3 3 ppb dehydroxylation and dealkylation of ppb side chains have resulted in tps as reported in studies involving uvc h2o2 systems 143 ozonation 144 ferrate vi 145 and uva and zero valent iron activated persulfate processes 13 some of these tps include propyl benzoate methyl benzoate 4 hydroxybenzoic acid and methylparaben 13 in the presence of ho radicals hydroxylation has been reported as the main transformation pathway 143 mono and hydroxylated derivatives mainly result from the ho attack in the ortho position of the phenolic ring and subsequently in the propyl ester chain 113 the formation of di and tri hydroxylated isomers at the aromatic ring have also been reported during ozonation concerning toxicity theoretical predictions calculated by the ecosar software indicated that all tps identified during ppb degradation are less toxic to fish daphnid and green algae than the parent compound 13 ppb and methyl benzoate are harmful to all the aforementioned aquatic organisms while 4 hydroxybenzoic acid and methylparaben were harmful to daphnia sp and green algae in contrast propyl benzoate is not considered a threat to any of the aforementioned organisms 13 on the other hand tps of greater toxicity to p phosphoreum s capricornutum and d magna compared to ppb have been identified 81 in addition it has been demonstrated that tps formed by hydroxylation in the aromatic ring of the ho adduct pathway fig 7 have greater toxicity than those formed by the h abstraction pathway based on this finding and added to the increase in initial acute toxicity observed during degradation it can be inferred that i each degradation pathway has a specific contribution to total toxicity and ii a careful determination of optimum treatment time during aops is necessary to ensure toxicity removal during cec treatment in aqueous matrices 4 concluding remarks and future trends this review highlights recent developments in the application of aops for the removal of bp 3 fip and ppb in aqueous matrices with an estimate of only 40 in real matrices in general tps identified during bp 3 and ppb were less toxic than parent compound and the main degradation mechanisms which led to their generation for all of the three target compounds were hydroxylation dealkylation and oxidation furthermore toxicity reduction was also reported after the treatment of matrices containing these target compounds by aops although it has been shown that each degradation pathway has a specific contribution to total toxicity mechanistic aspects related to toxicity reduction and interaction between parent compounds tps matrix components and aquatic biota remain unclear in addition despite the fact that several studies have reported satisfactory performance and innovative findings in example the use of red mud as a natural and alternative source of metals for persulfate ion activation improvement of optical properties of photocatalysts among others towards the application of aops for the removal of these compounds low degradation efficiencies 48 60 were achieved in real matrices thus reinforcing the need for studies with this type of matrix to better understand the influence of matrix composition and toxicity of treated sample aiming the application of these technologies as tertiary treatment in wastewater treatment plants for the removal of refractory and toxic organic compounds

12830,benzophenone 3 bp 3 fipronil fip and propylparaben ppb are chemical compounds classified as contaminants of emerging concern cec and known as refractory to natural biological degradation and conventional water treatments their occurrence in aqueous matrices is threatening to ecosystems making it necessary to implement efficient technologies for their elimination from these matrices advanced oxidation processes aops have been suggested as complementary tertiary treatments in municipal wastewater treatment plants aiming at cec degradation this review provides a timely overview of different aops reported for bp 3 fip and ppb degradation to give a complete picture of current knowledge regarding their removal from aqueous matrices recent progresses on circumventing negative effects of operational parameters were also surveyed and contrasted the involvement of green chemistry more exactly sustainable chemistry practices in these processes evidenced by the use of red mud for persulfate activation is an important step forward however low degradation rates 48 achieved in real matrices continue to be a challenge for aops performance in real scale in addition published studies point out to successful degradation of target cec with the formation of less toxic transformation products for bp 3 and ppb finally the current status of these processes regarding new developments and applications of aops is presented along with merits and limitations graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords contaminants of emerging concern environmental aqueous matrices fenton ozonation transformation products ultrasound 1 introduction in recent years there has been serious environmental concern associated to the frequent detection of contaminants of emerging concern cec in aqueous matrices with emphasis on pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps and pesticides 1 the detection of these cec at trace levels specifically benzophenone 3 bp 3 fipronil fip and propylparaben ppb has also increased 2 6 bp 3 was detected in outdoor swimming pool water 7 8 and surface water 9 at concentration levels up to hundreds of ng l 1 fip was detected in concentrations that exceed established reference value to preserve aquatic life c a 11 ng l 1 by 46 in california surface waters 148 70 in u s streams and rivers 149 and by 20 in agricultural multi use streams in the usa 149 ppb has been recognized for its constant presence in water at concentrations levels ranging from ng l 1 to Î¼g l 1 4 6 150 which are known to affect aquatic biota 13 14 there are several sources of these contaminants to aquatic compartments 1 such as i discharge of domestic and industrial effluents ii disposal of expired or unused pesticides and pharmaceutical products and iii application of sludge from municipal wastewater treatment plants mwwtp in agricultural fields with subsequent runoff to surface water disposal and inadequate treatment of waste containing bp 3 fip and ppb impact biotic and abiotic components of ecosystems 15 17 bp 3 is one of the most widely used uv filters and exposure to high levels of this compound during critical growth periods of the marine diatom chaetoceros gracilis may cause endocrine alterations to these species 18 some harmful effects reported for bp 3 in aquatic organisms include a effects on reproduction and signaling of sex hormones thus damaging egg production and incubation and reducing testosterone and negative regulation of steroidogenic genes in fish 19 20 b inhibition of growth development and reproduction on the benthic insect chironomus riparius 21 22 and c coral discoloration 23 fip is used to control fleas and ticks in pets and its occurrence in mwwtp effluents discharged to the environment has been identified as a potential toxicity factor to aquatic invertebrates 16 ppb is widely applied in the formulation of personal care products due to its preservative action thus showing antimicrobial activity 151 this compound may affect human health due to its endocrine disrupting activity 17 furthermore long term use of ppb has been associated with breast cancer 13 152 studies evaluating alternatives for the treatment of aqueous matrices containing bp 3 fip and ppb deserve special attention as these compounds are hazardous to ecosystem integrity advanced oxidation processes aops based on the generation of highly reactive hydroxyl ho and sulfate so4 radicals 26 27 have been identified as effective technologies for the degradation of cecs in different aqueous matrices in contrast studies evaluating the application of these processes for the degradation of these three compounds are scarce fig 1a and more than half were carried out in deionized water fig 1b this strongly justifies the need for a structured review on the main findings from these few studies a search on scientific databases pointed out to a total of 62 scientific publications on aops applied either for individual or simultaneous degradation of bp 3 fip and ppb in aqueous matrices figs 1a and 2 the lowest number of publications 13 publications is associated to fip fig 2 however considering only the studies in real matrices the number of publications for this compound is in the order of 36 against 32 for the other two compounds bp 3 and ppb fig 2 interestingly to the best of our knowledge there is no study reporting simultaneous degradation of all three target compounds or at least two of them this gap reinforces the need for this critical review recent and relevant review papers have compiled results concerning the degradation of parabens 29 30 153 and fip 31 in aqueous matrices with a focus on photocatalysis aimed at the development of efficient photocatalytic semiconductor materials some authors have extended their review beyond photocatalysis 32 33 and focused on the classical operating principles of these aops while compiling degradation results on paraben however to the best of our knowledge no review papers including reports of aops for sunscreen especially bp 3 degradation have been published yet this is the first critical review of the current literature focusing exclusively on aops reported either for single or simultaneous degradation of bp 3 fip and ppb in aqueous matrices with emphasis on real matrices while aiming at the evaluation of operational parameters toxicity changes and degradation pathways which lead to the main transformation products tps the main goal of this review is to highlight the advantages of innovative strategies arising from adaptation of operational parameters in each reviewed aop in order to achieve satisfactory degradation efficiencies and reduced toxicity among these strategies the following stand out i replacement of iron salts by organic iron complexes in the conventional photo fenton process aiming at handling the treatment at the natural ph of real aqueous matrices ii the effect of the relationship between light source and catalyst film thickness on photocatalytic properties iii use of apparently useless natural material or waste in example red mud as alternative persulfate activators furthermore this review provides clarity for the choice of the most eco friendly photocatalysts as photocatalytic properties of tio2 based and non tio2 based photocatalysts are compared as a function of required dosages and toxicity of tio2 and zno nanoparticles to aquatic ecosystems and human health overall this critical review provides an in depth discussion regarding the new development and use of aops as well as their merits and limitations on the degradation of target cec comparison and discussion of the intricacies of various aops and prediction of future areas for their application justify the relevance of this review in terms of reviewed literature the study focused on research published in the past ten years however older papers which had an important impact and contributions to the research progress were also included to the present review the choice of bp 3 fip and ppb as target compounds was based on their widespread use occurrence in aquatic compartments at unsafe concentration levels for the environment and scarcity of studies on their treatment and removal finally this review also provides recommendations for future research on the application and improvement of aops the review is organized according to the following structure section 2 effects of operational parameters of each revised aop fenton reactions heterogeneous photocatalysis photo assisted peroxidation sulfate radicals based aops sonochemistry ozonation electrochemical oxidation photolysis of monochloramine and hypochlorite ions on the degradation of target compounds and main advances and outcomes related to each one section 3 degradation pathways and tps for each target cec as well as toxicity evolution in all treatment stages figs 3 5 section 4 concluding remarks and outlooks which provide highlights on the current integration between innovative and conventional treatment strategies while aiming to circumvent negative effects of aops operational parameters and challenges associated to the removal of bp 3 fip and ppb in real matrices 2 advanced oxidation processes aops 2 1 fenton reactions the fenton process is characterized by the generation of ho radicals through catalytic decomposition of h2o2 in the presence of fe2 ions at acid medium eq 1 34 146 the reaction between fe3 and h2o2 represents one of the main fenton reaction mechanisms and occurs slowly in the dark k 9 1 10 7 mol l 1 s 1 one of the alternatives to accelerate this reaction is through exposition to uv vis radiation known as the photo fenton process 36 incidence of uv vis radiation on fe iii aquo complexes eq 2 promotes transfer of the ligand metal charge which implies on the reduction of fe iii to fe ii and oxidation of the ligand thus generating ho radical 1 fe 2 h 2 o 2 fe 3 ho ho k 76 l mol 1 s 1 2 fe oh 2 hv fe 2 ho fenton reaction reached satisfactory degradation of bp 3 fip and ppb 37 42 table 1 shows removal rates and percent reductions on dissolved organic carbon doc and chemical oxygen demand cod obtained by this process in various water matrices bp 3 was completely degraded by photo fenton in deionized water 37 and by photoelectro fenton in mwwtp effluent 41 mineralization levels above 60 in water were reached after 300 min of photo fenton at ph 3 37 despite incomplete mineralization of bp 3 in deionized water 37 organic content remained in the matrix thus indicating the formation of highly stable tps a similar behavior was observed during the degradation of fip in industrial wastewater via photo fenton at ph 2 9 reaching 60 and 75 removals of doc and cod respectively 38 treatment of industrial water a much more complex matrix than previously mentioned studies containing high levels of fip required the integration of coagulation flocculation settling processes that allowed for toxicity reduction and increased biodegradability in contrast 63 degradation of ppb was obtained after a longer treatment time 180 min in deionized water and at ph 5 7 39 limited degradation rate 70 is justified by iron precipitation in the form of insoluble hydroxides at ph 3 0 thus drastically decreasing its interaction with h2o2 and consequently reducing the production of ho radicals considering that the natural ph of environmental aqueous matrices is close to neutrality 42 44 acidification and neutralization are required respectively before and after treatment thus increasing treatment cost and time and making the application of photo fenton at acidic ph unlikely in real aqueous matrices photo fenton process at neutral ph is enabled by the introduction of organic iron complexes that allow for dissolved iron availability over a broad ph range 45 furthermore iron complexes contribute to increasing light absorption efficiency as they extend the absorption band to the visible region 46 47 photolysis of these iron complexes leads to the formation of fe2 eq 1 thus improving the efficiency of the photo fenton process 45 48 3 fe 3 l aq hÎ½ fe 3 l aq fe 2 aq l aq different organic iron ligands oxalate ox citrate cit nitrilotriacetic acid nta ethylene diaminetetraacetic acid edta and ethylenediamine n n succinic edds have been reported as efficient for the treatment of various aqueous matrices containing cecs 44 48 54 when fe iii is dissolved in aqueous solutions in the presence of one of the aforementioned ligands soluble compounds containing fe iii are formed at ph 3 0 45 understanding the speciation of organic iron complexes as a function of ph is extremely important for choosing the complex to be used in the degradation process for each matrix for instance edta forms soluble complexes without fe iii precipitation up to basic ph values fig 1a while cit nta ox and edds make fe iii available until almost neutral ph by forming soluble complexes fig 3c f solar photo fenton conducted at ph 6 0 led to 83 fip degradation in mwwtp effluent in the presence of fe cit complex at 1 3 m ratio 42 in this context a previous study evaluated the performance of fecit and feox species for fip degradation in distilled water fig 4 best results were obtained with fecit compared to feox fig 4 due to higher solubility of iron citrate complexes compared to iron oxalate complexes which agrees with speciation diagrams shown in fig 3b and 3d these results show that the adaptation of the photo fenton process by using fecit complex may be a viable alternative to prevent the precipitation of iron in natural water matrices during fip degradation in addition an improvement in fip degradation occurred when fe cit molar ratios increased from 1 1 to 1 3 fig 4a and feox from 1 3 to 1 6 fig 4b yet this was not observed for higher molar ratios these results demonstrate the importance of optimizing iron ligand molar ratios for each complex and matrix to avoid simultaneous iron precipitation and competition of the ligand for hydroxyl radicals thus maximizing the degradation efficiency fig 4 the use of fecit complexes is also interesting considering that effluents from some production processes may be used as alternative sources of cit thus increasing processes sustainability 55 although maximum fip degradation loq 17 Î¼g l 1 was obtained in distilled water 42 this result is associated to the absence of inorganic ions and natural organic matter in this matrix the competitive action of some inorganic ions chloride sulfate phosphate carbonate and bicarbonate present in real environmental matrices constitutes one of the main limitations for the application of aops in real matrices since they act as scavengers of ho radicals and or absorb or scatter light 56 thus reducing removal efficiency the fenton reaction has also been adapted to electrochemical aops i e photoelectron fenton process which are characterized by continuous in situ generation of h2o2 by electrochemical reduction of o2 in the cathode and continuous supply of fe ii which allows for the formation of ho radicals photoelectron fenton has been highlighted as an emerging technology in the context of aops 27 57 the merits of the photoelectron fenton process also include the involvement of other processes such as adsorption anodic oxidation and flocculation 57 bp 3 was completely degraded in mwwtp effluent after 20 min of treatment by photoelectron fenton 41 according to outcomes highlighted in this section different adaptations to the fenton reaction have been successfully applied for the degradation of bp 3 fip and ppb effective treatment in real applications is still a challenge due to ph limitations and natural matrix constituents therefore strategies aimed at increasing treatment effectiveness at circumneutral ph natural ph for most industrial and mwwtp effluents such as the use of organic iron complexes should be encouraged furthermore the use of solar radiation 42 and the search for innovative and selective oxidants are crucial to reduce energy costs and to circumvent the competitive action of inorganic ions present in the matrix 2 2 heterogeneous photocatalysis heterogeneous photocatalysis is based on the electronic excitation of a semiconductor oxide in the presence of artificial or solar radiation to generate hydroxyl radicals capable of oxidizing natural organic matter 58 and also cec present in water matrices several semiconductors have been used in heterogeneous photocatalysis such as fe2o3 zno zns cds and tio2 59 when a semiconductor is bombarded with photons electrons in the valence band vb are transferred to the conduction band cb leaving positive holes h eq 4 60 which react with water or hydroxyl groups adsorbed on the semiconductor surface and finally generating ho radicals eqs 5 and 6 besides the h has a high standard reduction potential 2 0 to 3 5 v and can also oxidize target contaminants 61 62 the photon energy needed to generate an electron gap pair must be equal to or greater than that of the gap 60 electrons present in the cb freely or trapped on its surface reduce the adsorbed o2 forming the superoxide anion radical o2 eq 7 and reducing the probability of recombination of the electron gap pair 63 the superoxide radical is highly oxidizing and generates new radical forms 62 leading to mineralization of organic pollutants adsorbed on the semiconductor surface 64 4 semiconductor hÎ½ semiconductor h vb e cb 5 h h 2 o ads ho h 6 h ho ads ho 7 e o 2 o 2 furthermore photocatalytic degradation efficiency is influenced by total irradiated energy absorbed by the suspended catalyst absorbed energy depends on the optical properties of each photocatalyst scattering and absorption coefficients photocatalytic oxidation of fip in drinking water was performed using zno and tio2 as catalysts under solar and artificial irradiation 65 the addition of na2s2o8 section 2 4 was relevant to improve fip degradation efficiency 65 catalyst concentrations required to reach the same rate of energy absorption during the process were equivalent to 200 mg l 1 for zno and 53 mg l 1 for tio2 65 however toxic effects including alteration of intracellular ca2 flux generation of reactive oxygen species membrane damage and mitochondrial dysfunction were detected in the presence of zno nanoparticles 66 besides tio2 and zno nanoparticles were harmful to gram positive bacillus subtilis and gram negative escherichia coli organisms and antibacterial activity was higher for zno compared to tio2 67 despite high degradation efficiencies using any of the tested oxides zno 99 2 tio2 98 5 table 2 a lower concentration of tio2 is required 53 mg l 1 when compared to zno 200 mg l 1 thus tio2 represents lower environmental impact this underlines from an environmental point view the relevance of a deep understanding regarding optical properties of photocatalysts still toxicity associated to tio2 nanoparticles and other catalysts must be further investigated 68 still concerning heterogeneous photocatalysis it is important to highlight the merit of monolithic cellulose acetate structures coated with commercial films of catalyst nanoparticles these structures can be arranged in different geometries to obtain a larger area of illuminated catalyst per reactor volume in addition they contain a large number of walls in which photocatalyst nanoparticles are deposited thus providing a high area volume ratio 9 evidently high bp 3 degradation efficiencies 95 were achieved using supported catalyst monolithic structures coated with p25 9 besides an increase in the number of thin layers of immobilized tio2 p25 on the outer walls of the monolithic cellulose acetate structure from 1 to 3 led to a decrease in half life time t1 2 required for bp 3 degradation from 13 to 6 min and resulted in maximum degradation efficiency equivalent to 91 within 30 min of irradiation 9 this result was obtained by the frontal lighting mechanism during which an increase in the thickness of the catalyst film increases the generation of charge carriers to the point where the light is completely absorbed by the catalyst layer 69 the addition of 20 mg l 1 h2o2 to the tio2 p25 uv a system treating real swimming pool water reached bp 3 concentration below the detection limit lod 0 20 Î¼g l 1 within 6 min of irradiation with a consumption of 22 of the initial h2o2 concentration 9 this synergistic effect was also observed for ppb degradation 70 the addition of h2o2 to the photocatalytic system prevents electron hole recombination by accepting photogenerated electrons from the cb and allows for the production of additional ho the work also evaluated the effect of water matrix composition upon ppb degradation and treatment efficiency decreased in the presence of higher concentrations of organic matter as follows ultrapure water reservoir water river water wastewater this fact was justified by the competition between natural organic matter and target pollutant for ho and also by the scavenging action of po4 3 and hco3 species 70 2 2 1 photocatalyst reusability and separation although photocatalyst suspensions are efficient for secondary wastewater quality improvement separation of catalyst from solution after treatment and its reusability are some of the main drawbacks associated the application of photocatalysis in real scale catalyst recovery may be enhanced through charge neutralization and coagulation with electrolytes 71 73 regarding tio2 its isoelectric point or point of zero charge phpzc 6 4 6 6 74 is close to ph 7 73 at this ph value tio2 particle surface is mainly occupied by neutral groups tioh and a small amount of charged species tio tioh2 thus reducing electrostatic repulsion between tio2 particles 71 electrolytes present in the aqueous matrix neutralize charged species and reduce the thickness of the electrochemical double layer of the particles thus resulting in lower repulsion between particles and promoting coagulation 71 75 therefore sedimentation rates and the hydrodynamic diameter of tio2 particles are maximum at the isoelectric point ph of natural water matrices 73 which can be adequate for full scale application besides metal free photocatalysts may be adapted for recycling and reuse a recent progress consisted in the preparation of graphitic carbon nitride hydrogel microspheres with cross linking reactions between sodium alginate and calcium ions this material is separation free from the liquid phase for reuse 76 the potential of calcium alginate lies in its hydroxyl that allows for increased adsorption of organic pollutants as well as increased transfer and separation of photogenerated charge carriers 76 however studies on real wastewater are still needed to consolidate progress on the separation and reuse of metal free photocatalysts 2 2 2 ph effect on photocatalytic degradation of bp 3 fip and ppb although the effect of ph in the photocatalytic reaction is generally attributed to the surface charge of the semiconductor 65 knowledge about the speciation of target molecules fig s1 as a function of ph is also relevant to predict the effect of ph in this type of process a negligible adsorption of bp 3 on the surface of photocatalysts tio2 p25 phzpc 6 25 77 tio2 pc500 phzpc 6 05 78 and tio2 pc105 phzpc 3 83 79 was observed at ph 7 0 9 although bp 3

p25 and tio2 pc500 surfaces are predominantly neutral tioh at ph 7 while tio2 pc105 surface is negatively charged tio under the same conditions thus electrostatic repulsion or no electrostatic interaction are expected to occur between catalyst surface and bp 3 molecule at ph 7 0 9 although the effect of ph in the photocatalytic reaction is generally attributed to the surface charge of the semiconductor 65 knowledge about the speciation of target molecules fig s1 as a function of ph is also relevant to predict the effect of ph in this type of process a negligible adsorption of bp 3 on the surface of photocatalysts tio2 p25 phzpc 6 25 77 tio2 pc500 phzpc 6 05 78 and tio2 pc105 phzpc 3 83 79 was observed at ph 7 0 9 although bp 3 molecule has only one pka 9 65 80 its neutral form prevails at ph 7 0 fig s1a which is the usual ph associated to natural waters considering the aforementioned phzpc values for tio2 structures tio2 p25 and tio2 pc500 surfaces are predominantly neutral tioh at ph 7 while tio2 pc105 surface is negatively charged tio under the same conditions thus electrostatic repulsion or no electrostatic interaction are expected to occur between catalyst surface and bp 3 molecule at ph 7 0 9 fenol et al 65 studied the influence of initial ph 7 1 on the kinetics of photocatalytic degradation of fip using tio2 phpzc 6 0 and zno phpzc 9 0 fip is neutral over a wide ph range fig s1b the surface of tio2 and zno are predominantly positively charged below phs 6 0 and 9 0 respectively and negatively charged above these values hence electrostatic attraction or repulsion between fip and the catalysts occurred in the reference study resulting respectively in increase or inhibition of fip photodegradation rate since ph values ranging from 6 0 to 8 0 produce a negligible effect on tio2 and zno photocatalytic treatment can be successfully carried out at an initial ph around 7 0 65 it is worth mentioning that zno may react with a base to form zn oh 2 at a basic ph this increases toxicity due to the generation of zn2 in the solution 65 as it is bioavailable to aquatic biota thus its application for the treatment of real matrices prior to discharge must be supported by toxicity studies fenol et al 65 studied the influence of initial ph 7 1 on the kinetics of photocatalytic degradation of fip using tio2 phpzc 6 0 and zno phpzc 9 0 fip is neutral over

be supported by toxicity studies the adsorption of ppb is more efficient in acidic and neutral media than in basic media fang et al 81 observed a rapid decrease in ppb degradation efficiency when ph was increased from 3 0 to 11 0 as the pka of ppb is equivalent to 8 24 81 it tends to occur mainly in the neutral form in environmental waters showing a small dissociation so it may be adsorbed onto tio2 surface which holds a positive charge below the phpzc 6 2 81 furthermore further increase in the ph to values above 8 24 led to ppb transformation to its anionic form fig s1c which is hardly adsorbed by the negatively charged tio2 thus decreasing the degradation efficiencies it is noteworthy that basic conditions can drastically increase the formation of the phenoxyl radical from ppb which can react with hydrated electrons e aq to regenerate the original compound 81 82 decreasing ppb degradation efficiency furthermore decreased degradation efficiency at high ph values may also result from the transformation of ho radical pka 11 9 into a less reactive oxide radical ion o 83 similar decrease in photocatalytic degradation of metronidazole mz 84 85 and tetracycline tc 86 in the order of 50 80 were observed when ph values of respective solutions were adjusted from 3 0 to 9 0 and from 3 0 to 11 0 therefore at basic ph 9 0 and 11 0 there was repulsion between negatively charged photocatalysts ag d nzf 85 and mnfe ldo biochar 84 86 and anionic species of the target compounds mz and tc 84 86 the adsorption of ppb is more efficient in acidic and neutral media than in basic

considering the intrinsic relationship between alkalinity and ph it is also important to underline that alkalinity exerts a significant inhibitory effect on the process as it blocks active sites on the photocatalyst surface by high concentrations of organic matter 70 therefore the application of these processes in alkaline waters may not be efficient for the removal of target compounds 2 3 photo assisted peroxidation the exposition of h2o2 to uv c radiation generates ho radicals through the homolytic cleavage of h2o2 thus increasing efficiency of cec degradation when compared to uv c radiation alone eq 8 87 88 147 in general h2o2 photolysis is performed under low or medium pressure mercury vapor lamps 254 nm however high concentrations of h2o2 were necessary to reach satisfactory degradation efficiencies at 254 nm due to the low absorptivity of this oxidant in this spectral region Îµ254 18 6 l mol 1 cm 1 90 xenon doped mercury lamp emitting in the range between 210 and 240 nm may be used as an alternative despite increased costs associated to this lamp 90 uv c photolysis provided limited bp 3 degradation efficiency with degradation yields between 20 and 60 after 60 min of treatment in ultrapure water 91 the same radiation was also applied to different real water matrices river sea and pool and bp 3 degradation was lower in the presence of higher organic matter content in contrast uv c h2o2 system was successful on the removal 90 of 21 compounds used as uv filters with almost complete degradation of bp 3 after 20 min of irradiation in swimming pool water 91 although h2o2 photolysis is ph dependent h2o2 cleavage occurs mainly ho2 at alkaline ph it has numerous advantages over other aops such as the absence of sludge formation complete miscibility between h2o2 and water stability and commercial availability 92 in addition h2o2 has no phase transfer limitations and investment costs are low 93 8 h 2 o 2 aq hÎ½ 2ho aq table 2 shows the summary of papers regarding

different aqueous matrices 2 4 sulfate radical based aops sr aops sulfate radical so4 based aops sr aops have become a recent trend as alternative methods for the treatment of cec 13 97 99 persulfate s2o8 2 is used as an alternative to h2o2 in different aops such as uv c s2o8 2 and persulfate based fenton and photo fenton these systems result in the generation of so4 whose standard reduction potential 2 60 v is greater than that observed for s2o8 2 2 10 v thus allowing for the degradation of contaminants at trace concentrations 1 52 100 so4 is highly reactive and has an improved selectivity compared to ho radical as it only reacts with organic compounds through the electron transfer mechanism in contrast the ho radical reacts mainly by hydrogen abstraction 101 furthermore a greater stability is observed for sulfate radical which has a lifespan of 30 to 40 Î¼s besides so4 standard reduction potential 2 5 to 3 1 v is greater than that observed for ho radical in basic medium 1 9 v 102 103 as expected uv s2o8 2 was a better alternative for bp 3 degradation and toxicity removal in deionized water at ph 7 0 when compared to uv h2o2 94 as so4 presents higher selectivity than ho the performance of ho oxidative processes is more affected by inorganic ions and organic matter present in real waters than sr aops this is advantageous to the application of sr aops for the treatment of cec present in real matrices in this sense it is possible to obtain equivalent or better results via sulfate radical based aops 102 besides s2o8 2 may be activated by various mechanisms such as i base activation 104 ii uv 254 nm 105 and ir 455 nm 106 light iii transition metal eqs 9 and 10 107 109 and iv heat 110 9 fe 2 aq s 2 o 8 2 aq fe 3 aq so 4 aq so 4 2 aq 10 fe 2 aq so 4 aq fe 3 aq so 4 2 aq artificial uv a light has been applied for the activation of s2o8 2 during the degradation of target compounds in real water matrices 13 65 99 and in deionized water 94 111 reaching 99 degradation in deionized water only the pseudo first order rate constant observed for bp 3 degradation in ultrapure water was reduced by 54 in seawater for individual systems via uv s2o8 2 this decay in treatment efficiency was associated to the conversion of ho and so4 into reactive halogenated species in seawater 99 a similar effect was observed during ppb degradation for which reaction in wastewater was 10 fold slower than in ultrapure water 112 heat transition metal ions fe2 cu2 and co2 and uv light 254 nm have also been used to activate s2o8 2 for bp 3 degradation bp 3 was completely degraded at 40 c and all tested activation methods were significantly more efficient in aqueous solution 111 furthermore results showed that fe2 has the greatest promotion effect when compared to other transition metal ions 111 this finding is supported by rastogi et al 51 who proposed iron as an environmentally friendly and economic species compared to other transition metals 90 ppb degradation in the presence of s2o8 2 and magnetite nanomaterials gives further evidence of iron effectiveness to activate persulfate 113 in addition zero valent iron was more effective for persulfate activation than artificial uv a when both activation methods were tested for ppb degradation in tap water 13 special attention must also be given to red mud as a persulfate activator in the present study since it is a natural source of metal oxides rich in fe al ti si na and cu this system was tested for ppb degradation in aqueous matrices 112 despite high ppb degradation rates obtained in deionized 99 and tap water 92 112 new strategies are required to improve aops degradation efficiency by red mud e g coupling solar or artificial radiation to the process for the treatment of real matrices since only 48 degradation table 3 was obtained in wastewater furthermore graphene was also efficient as a catalyst in the activation of sodium persulfate resulting in 95 degradation of ppb within 15 min of reaction 114 2 5 other aops 2 5 1 sonochemistry the propagation of ultrasound through a liquid leads to the generation of bubbles from gas cores in liquids and these bubbles grow and collapse through cycles of compression and rarefaction 115 during the collapse of these bubbles temperature and pressure may reach extreme values around 227 c and hundreds of atmospheres leading to the thermal dissociation of water vapor into different reactive species 115 116 this phenomenon allows for the formation of ho radicals in aqueous systems from the thermal dissociation of water vapor 116 sonochemical reactions may occur i inside the collapsing bubbles ii in the bubble liquid interfacial region where ho radicals are predominant and iii in most solutions 115 118 during sonolysis non volatile and hydrophilic compounds are oxidized by radicals at the interface of bubbles or in the solution while volatile and hydrophobic pollutants are generally pyrolyzed within bubble cavity 116 118 119 since bp3 is a non volatile compound with low water solubility its degradation occurs either in the solution or on the surface of bubbles being higher in the former as the concentration of ho radicals is higher on bubble surface acidic medium ph 2 enhances bp 3 hydrophobicity ionic fraction 8 71 10 5 thus favoring its accumulation in the interfacial region and increasing degradation rate 116 sonochemical treatment efficiency may be affected by the presence of inorganic ions and different dissolved gases as previously described anions negatively affect the performance of several aops yet no consensus has been reached on how they affect sonochemical treatments bicarbonate hco3 ion reacts with ho radicals to produce carbonate co3 radical 120 which can migrate to the bulk solution and promote pollutant degradation migration capacity is not observed for ho radicals and although the co3 radical is less reactive than the ho radical it attacks bp 3 molecules in solution 116 in contrast nitrate no3 and chloride cl ions show a scavenging effect thus competing with bp 3 for ho radicals 116 ozone treatment enhanced by ultrasound was more efficient in the degradation of bp 3 when compared to conventional ozonation 116 this is justified by the fact that ultrasound promotes the transfer of the ozone mass to the liquid and ozone also decomposes thermolytically in the vapor phase of bubbles cavity thus increasing the efficiency of ho radical formation 116 121 the presence of o2 in the ultrasonic treatment increased the degradation of bp 3 by 6 7 while n2 inhibited the degradation efficiency of the same pollutant by 18 3 116 two main reasons are pointed out for this behavior i generation of additional ho radicals by the dissociation of molecular oxygen inside the cavitation bubble 122 and ii free radical scavenging by molecular nitrogen 115 furthermore degradation by ultrasound does not require additives and no waste is generated the effect of frequency and power density on bp 3 1 0 mg l 1 degradation efficiency was analyzed and best degradation rate 98 was obtained using 574 khz and 200 w l 1 123 2 5 2 ozonation and electrochemical oxidation the principles of ozonation and electrochemical oxidation were recently reviewed 27 in ozonation ho radicals are generated through i photolysis of o3 in aqueous medium ii reaction between o3 and h2o2 in basic medium and iii reaction between o3 and oh ions present in the water 124 125 furthermore molecular ozone may react directly with dissolved contaminants through the electrophilic attack mechanism 126 the degradation of different parabens including ppb was investigated using single ozonation and various ozone combined processes in ultrapure water o3 uv tio2 h2o2 process was the most efficient in the degradation of parabens at ph 8 127 in electrochemical aops transfer of electrons or oxygen atoms may oxidize electrochemical species in aqueous solutions 128 for example in the case of a photo electron fenton process h2o2 is continuously generated in situ by electrochemical o2 reduction on the cathode and fe ii is continuously regenerated on the cathode allowing for the formation of ho radicals 27 fip degradation was evaluated in aqueous solution using advanced electrochemical oxidation and process efficiency was evaluated based on cod removal 79 chlorine 52 and fluorine reduction 52 154 a recent study has shown that a cell configuration based on solid polymer electrolyte which avoids the addition of salt to increase solution conductivity was more efficient in the degradation of parabens cod removal of 91 than the conventional system based on a boron doped diamond 81 130 2 5 3 photolysis of monochloramine and hypochlorite ion oxidants such as monochloramine and hypochlorite have been investigated and introduced in a photolytic process for the generation of hydroxyl radicals and other reactive species the combination of chlorine and uv radiation is one of the newest alternatives under investigation for the treatment of contaminated water 131 although chlorine gas is commonly used in this process monochloramine has been identified to replace as it is able to control the possible formation of disinfection by products such as trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids 132 another advantage of using chloramine in the degradation of cecs is the production of ho radicals and other reactive species changes in reaction ph can cause the conversion of monochloramine into dichloramine and trichloramine which can also be decomposed into reactive species by uv irradiation with high values of quantum yields uv irradiation of inorganic chloramines produces the chlorine radical cl 133 and monochloramine which is more stable compared to chlorine thus providing lasting residual chlorine in the reaction system 134 uv light can effectively activate hypochlorite to produce ho radicals 135 136 the optimal ph range for this process is 3 6 137 it has been found that the contribution of ho radicals for the degradation of bp3 increases at acidic ph values while reactivity of chlorine species such as cl increases at neutral and basic ph values 138 table 4 summarizes studies related to the application of aops mentioned in this section for the degradation of bp 3 fip and ppb in aqueous matrices satisfactory degradation efficiencies were achieved in most cases as most studies were carried out in deionized water table 4 hence it would be convenient to direct efforts towards the application of these techniques in real matrices 3 degradation pathways transformation products tps and toxicity identification and monitoring of tps play a key role in the degradation of cec since degradation products formed during treatment may be more toxic than target compounds therefore it is important to monitor the generation and degradation of these tps which is made possible by applying analytical techniques such as liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms ms liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry lc qtof ms and gas chromatography time of flight mass spectrometry gc qtof ms 3 1 bp 3 lee et al 138 investigated bp 3 transformation pathway under chlorination and uv chlorination chlorinated derivatives were observed in both cases as a consequence of the electrophilic substitution of one or two h atoms by chlorine a typical reaction for phenolic compounds in the uv chlorination reaction an additional oxidation reaction by ho was observed to yield the formation of hydroxylated derivatives and promote the conversion of the carbonyl group to an ester further transformation steps including the formation of halogenated methoxyphenols and chloroform were only detected during chlorination the formation of chlorinated derivatives could be responsible for toxicity increase observed in the early stages of both reactions which was lower during uv chlorination treatment thus indicating that tps generated by this process are less toxic than those produced by chlorination alone this behavior is due to additional oxidation by reactive radicals produced by uv radiation coupled to the process which results in further mineralization of bp 3 bp 3 treatment in the presence of persulfate yielded the formation of 7 main tps 111 hydroxylation of the molecule in several positions was identified as the main route fig 5a up to 4 mono di and trihidroxilated derivatives could be detected demethylation and direct oxidation reactions as well as the loss of the non substituted benzene ring were also observed ho and so4 were identified as responsible for the degradation of bp 3 by persulfate the evaluation of toxicity associated to tps by ecosar software suggested a significant decrease in toxicity after treatment in the presence of persulfate however it is important to highlight that this software considers individual tp structure to predict acute and chronic toxicity and does not enable the evaluation of effects which may be promoted by the mixture nor by the interaction between tps and other components present in environmental waters such as sulfate carbonate and other ions tps identified during sonochemical degradation of bp 3 are shown in fig 5b 123 the tp identified as 1 2 hydroxy 4 methoxyphenyl propan 1 on was generated by ho attack on the unsubstituted benzene fraction which led to ring opening the formation of benzoic acid formation was previously reported during photochemical degradation of bp3 139 via oxidation by ho acetic and formic acid also arise from the non specific attack of ho on oxidized bp 3 intermediates in this study toxicity profile decreased at the beginning of sonochemical treatment growing after 30 degradation 3 2 fip the formation of several tps has been reported to occur during fip degradation by different treatments 38 42 65 140 154 fip degradation in the environment soil sediments and water occurs by means of oxidation reduction hydrolysis and photolysis reactions to yield fip sulfone fip sulfide fip carboxamide fip desulfinyl and fip detrifluoromethylsulfinyl as main tps 141 all or part of these compounds have also been detected in mwwtp effluents 142 and during the application of aops in all cases the transformation occurs preferentially in the pyrazole ring thus indicating greater stability of the 2 6 dichloro 4 trifluoromethyl phenyl moiety fip sulfone is the main tp identified in all reported treatments 141 142 and was observed during photocatalytic degradation 65 140 and also by photo fenton process 42 the main mechanism of generation of this intermediate was oxidation 42 65 initiated by ho attack on the sulfur atom 42 recent studies 42 have evidenced the formation of new tps by photo fenton treatment of fip as shown in fig 6 the formation of these tps includes the opening of the pyrazole ring tp4 and tp6 the rupture between the pyrazole and phenyl rings tp1 and tp2 and sequential ho attacks in the amino and trifluoromethyl groups from fip desulfinyl tp5 and tp8 finally chloramination reaction of fip sulfone takes place as a consequence of the treatment with naocl in reclaimed water 142 potential risks associated to the disinfection of this by product are still unknown fip and its main tps are reported as being highly toxic for many species such as insects birds aquatic organisms among others 141 nonetheless this toxicity may be reduced or eliminated by the application of aops if treatment time and conditions are properly optimized for instance reduction of acute toxicity towards drosophila melanogaster flies by solar photo fenton was obtained ph 6 in an stp effluent 42 besides da costa filho et al 38 demonstrated a reduction in acute toxicity for a salina from 100 to 13 during the photo fenton treatment applied to an industrial effluent containing high loads of fip in contrast fip and its tps did not show significant inhibitory effect to the bioluminescence of v fischeri monitored during fip degradation by tio2 heterogeneous photocatalysis 140 thus evidencing the critical need to perform toxicity tests with organisms from different trophic levels 3 3 ppb dehydroxylation and dealkylation of ppb side chains have resulted in tps as reported in studies involving uvc h2o2 systems 143 ozonation 144 ferrate vi 145 and uva and zero valent iron activated persulfate processes 13 some of these tps include propyl benzoate methyl benzoate 4 hydroxybenzoic acid and methylparaben 13 in the presence of ho radicals hydroxylation has been reported as the main transformation pathway 143 mono and hydroxylated derivatives mainly result from the ho attack in the ortho position of the phenolic ring and subsequently in the propyl ester chain 113 the formation of di and tri hydroxylated isomers at the aromatic ring have also been reported during ozonation concerning toxicity theoretical predictions calculated by the ecosar software indicated that all tps identified during ppb degradation are less toxic to fish daphnid and green algae than the parent compound 13 ppb and methyl benzoate are harmful to all the aforementioned aquatic organisms while 4 hydroxybenzoic acid and methylparaben were harmful to daphnia sp and green algae in contrast propyl benzoate is not considered a threat to any of the aforementioned organisms 13 on the other hand tps of greater toxicity to p phosphoreum s capricornutum and d magna compared to ppb have been identified 81 in addition it has been demonstrated that tps formed by hydroxylation in the aromatic ring of the ho adduct pathway fig 7 have greater toxicity than those formed by the h abstraction pathway based on this finding and added to the increase in initial acute toxicity observed during degradation it can be inferred that i each degradation pathway has a specific contribution to total toxicity and ii a careful determination of optimum treatment time during aops is necessary to ensure toxicity removal during cec treatment in aqueous matrices 4 concluding remarks and future trends this review highlights recent developments in the application of aops for the removal of bp 3 fip and ppb in aqueous matrices with an estimate of only 40 in real matrices in general tps identified during bp 3 and ppb were less toxic than parent compound and the main degradation mechanisms which led to their generation for all of the three target compounds were hydroxylation dealkylation and oxidation furthermore toxicity reduction was also reported after the treatment of matrices containing these target compounds by aops although it has been shown that each degradation pathway has a specific contribution to total toxicity mechanistic aspects related to toxicity reduction and interaction between parent compounds tps matrix components and aquatic biota remain unclear in addition despite the fact that several studies have reported satisfactory performance and innovative findings in example the use of red mud as a natural and alternative source of metals for persulfate ion activation improvement of optical properties of photocatalysts among others towards the application of aops for the removal of these compounds low degradation efficiencies 48 60 were achieved in real matrices thus reinforcing the need for studies with this type of matrix to better understand the influence of matrix composition and toxicity of treated sample aiming the application of these technologies as tertiary treatment in wastewater treatment plants for the removal of refractory and toxic organic compounds

powdered activated carbon pac dosing to a conventional activated sludge as reactor is a low investment option for controlling pharmaceutical compounds phcs in municipal wastewater treatment but its advantages and limitations in real operating environments are not fully assessed a 3 week pac as full scale test was conducted in an oxidation ditch plant to assess pac impact on effluent quality phcs dissolved organic carbon doc and other parameters energy consumption sludge production and costs doc normalized pac doses of 0 7 2 6 mgpac mgdoc significantly reduced recalcitrant phc discharge e g by 63 83 for carbamazepine and 67 69 for diclofenac the higher dose yielding a more reliable effluent quality effluent quality for total phosphorus colour organic matter and transmittance was also enhanced and no interference with nitrification oxidation reduction potential or dissolved oxygen in the oxidation ditch was observed resulting in no energy consumption increase pac had no impact on effluent turbidity and mixed liquor suspended solids settleability showing a positive effect on dewatered sludge dry weight and ultimately a 7 9 increase on final sludge production after stopping pac dosing pac remaining in the return sludge presented adsorption capacity for some phcs until it was completely out of the system estimated costs for pac addition to as reactor compare favourably with literature data for pac and gac post treatment and similarly with post ozonation keywords pharmaceutical compounds powdered activated carbon municipal wastewater powdered activated carbon activated sludge cost analysis 1 introduction pharmaceutical compounds phcs problematic in water is being studied and monitored in many regions worldwide due to their potential toxicity genotoxicity or endocrine disruption 1 2 and there is a lack of knowledge regarding the exact extent of the problems they could cause particularly those related to synergetic and chronic effects 3 4 for instance in the european union fifteen phcs have been included at least once in the three water watch lists published so far commission implementing decisions eu 2015 4951 2018 840 and 2020 1161 and both the recently published directive eu 2020 2184 for drinking water and the new regulation on minimum requirements for water reuse for agricultural irrigation regulation eu 2020 741 refer to phc restrictions depending on the risk assessment outcome for example in portugal silva et al 5 recently showed caffeine analgesics and non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids such as acetaminophen ibuprofen naproxen and diclofenac to be the most abundant phcs in raw wastewater in two portuguese municipal wwtps at concentrations ranging from few ng l up to several hundreds of Î¼g l both wwtps presenting similar concentration ranges and consistent with those reviewed in other studies in portugal europe and worldwide wastewater treatment plants wwtps as one of the main hotspots of phc release into the aquatic environment 6 are crucial barriers against them the reported removal of phcs in urban activated sludge as wwtps is quite variable 0 to 98 much depending on contaminants properties and wwtp operating conditions 7 11 some of the most abundant phcs at wwtp inlet are usually highly removed during biological conventional treatment in wwtps e g caffein acetaminophen ibuprofen and naproxen while others present variable removals e g erythromycin sulfamethoxazole atenolol or are recalcitrant to treatment e g carbamazepine and diclofenac 7 9 12 therefore despite there are some operational strategies to enhance phc removal during biological treatment 7 9 which should be implemented whenever possible there will always be a group of compounds poorly removed eliminated in a wwtp with a typical secondary treatment and for which advanced treatment is necessary 8 besides ozone activated carbon adsorption either in its powdered pac or granular gac forms is considered a consolidated and cost efficient technology for controlling organic microcontaminants 10 13 pac is usually applied in suspension requiring a well mixed wastewater pac contact zone e g stirred contact tank and an efficient downstream process to retain pac particles pac dosing directly into a conventional as reactor pac as has the advantage of ensuring pac exhaustion very long pac residence time equal to the sludge age without requiring additional investment 14 nor increased energy consumption as no extra pumping is required for pac recirculation and pac particles are separated from the treated water together with the excess sludge pac as seems a key potential cost effective solution particularly for wwtps with no tertiary treatment infrastructure the simplest being flocculation and filtration since it is straightforward to implement and easy to adjust to wastewater quality variations despite these benefits pac as scientific literature mostly consists on studies at lab scale many with synthetic wastewater 15 22 or at pilot and full scale but focused on industrial wastewater 14 21 23 26 as corroborated by a literature survey conducted in web of science database with keywords such as pact activated carbon adsorption biological hybrid wastewater activated sludge activated carbon adsorption full scale wastewater powdered activated carbon biological treatment in fact quite a lot of research was conducted and published since the 1970s on pac as industrial applications actually pac as is also known as pact a process developed in the 1970s by the american company dupont to treat their chambers works chemical manufacturing wastewater rich in heavy metals and dyes highly coloured and with variable biodegradable and non biodegradable organics 25 pac as is considered a relatively proven technology to remove organic matter from wastewater in a number of industries e g textile pulp and paper pharmaceutical chemical and particularly petroleum refineries and petrochemical plant with the largest applications of this technology and landfill leachates 14 25 26 a synergistic effect was observed between biodegradation and pac adsorption with pac eliminating metabolic acidic products adverse effects and improving the biomass accumulation the metabolic activity and sludge settleability 21 however those effects may not be directly applicable to municipal wastewater treatment due to different wastewater characteristics and operational conditions pact application for industrial wastewater treatment has typically higher sludge retention times pac doses mixed liquor suspended solids and pac concentrations in aeration 14 25 26 focusing on large scale studies of phc removal from municipal wwtps a great number of recent papers on adsorption biological hybrid processes investigated suspended sludge membrane bioreactors pac mbr 27 29 typically with smaller floc size higher specific floc surface per unit of reactor volume and operating at higher biomass concentrations and sludge age than pac as 7 30 and therefore not necessarily comparable pac as performance is expected to vary with the activated sludge system as pac concentration in the mixed liquor which is of utmost importance for the process cost effectiveness was shown to be directly proportional to the influent pac dose and the sludge age and inversely related with the hydraulic retention time hrt 14 16 24 also a strong relationship was seen between dye removal and biomass concentration in pac as lab experiments 17 overall a limited number of pac as full scale data on phc removal from municipal wwtps is available 31 32 and most data published in technical reports and papers written in german 33 37 and or in recent literature reviewing some of those studies 28 38 reported median removals with pac as varied between 75 and 99 for atenolol 38 95 for carbamazepine 28 95 for diclofenac 60 98 for metoprolol and 29 95 for sulfamethoxazole with pac doses between 5 and 30 mg l some authors showing no linear removal increase with pac dose 31 32 34 35 37 pac dosing downstream the biological treatment has been frequently preferred in known full scale municipal wwtp applications due to the expected higher pac doses needed in pac as 39 in fact one of the major drawbacks of pac as is pointed to be the much stronger adsorption competition of the background effluent organic matter efom considered to be much higher in biopolymers and humic substances in the mixed liquor by comparison with the secondary effluent 31 39 after earlier pac as pilot experiments zwickenpflug et al 33 and boehler et al 31 concluded full scale pac as required twice the pac dose for downstream pac dosing with double mode namely 2 4 mg pac mg doc vs 1 2 mg pac mg doc however those differences have been narrowing in more recent literature for example 2 3 mg pac mg doc for pac as vs 1 3 mg pac mg doc for downstream pac dosing 34 35 40 further research is necessary since competition and required doses highly depend on the organic background matrix and therefore on the activated sludge system implemented and its operating conditions but also on finding where to dose pac into the secondary treatment in order to minimize efom competition 40 in addition pac dosing impact on regular as operation also needs to be better clarified for instance though a higher sludge settleability with pac addition has been reported by some authors 14 33 41 others 34 35 only referred improvements when the settling properties of activated sludge are very poor and or flocculant is used in addition a 5 20 sludge production increase has been reported 33 35 but this also depends on mixed liquor suspended solids concentration in the aeration tank mlss and on sludge extraction i e on the plant capacity to accommodate the increase in inert solids and on the pac impact on sludge settling and dewatering rÃ¶Ãler and metzger 35 worked with constant solids concentration in the as reactor and reported higher sludge extraction only with pac doses higher than 15 mg l on the other hand pac dosing influence on nitrification is also not consensual some authors reporting a benefit mostly due to inhibitors reduction 14 23 15 42 44 and others referring no effect 33 35 or a possible inhibition due to a higher sludge extraction and subsequent reduction of sludge age 40 pac as impact on phosphorus removal is also controversial with studies revealing an enhancement 23 45 while others showing no effect 20 37 or results depending on the activated carbon 46 altogether pac as calls for a higher operational experience in real municipal wwtp conditions particularly taking into account the variations in activated sludge systems and a wider knowledge transfer for the water practitioners to fully understand its advantages and limitations as an option for controlling organic microcontaminants and for optimising its implementation to understand how far can pac enhance the overall conventional activated sludge treatment maintaining low cost low energy and low sludge production a 3 week industrial demonstration of pac direct addition to the oxidation ditch of a portuguese urban wwtp faro nw wwtp was conducted two pac doses were tested and a total of 4 tons of pac were added this paper aims to assess the pac removal efficiency of a set of phcs less prone to biodegradation and or to solids sorption in the as reactors as well as to verify the pac dosing impact on a wide range of wastewater quality parameters and the energy consumption the sludge production and the costs as research strategy before pac dosing trials the wwtp baseline was characterized 2 5 years to understand which phcs needed further treatment as well as to evaluate the wwtp effectiveness for other wastewater quality parameters and its energy efficiency 2 materials and methods 2 1 faro nw wwtp and the definition of the reference period faro norwest fnw wwtp operated by Ã¡guas do algarve s a ada has a 13 221 m3 day installed capacity and covers mostly urban areas of loulÃ© and faro municipalities algarve portugal the wwtp was designed for 44 530 population equivalent receiving mostly domestic wastewater 85 from a combined sewage network that has 2 pumping stations 45 with overflow systems for rainy events during the research project duration 2016 2019 fnw wwtp treated 4525 m3 day average daily flowrate the wastewater treatment line fig 1 comprises a preliminary treatment with sieving and degritting degreasing two lines of biological treatment line 1 currently out of work with activated sludge in an extended aeration regime oxidation ditch and secondary settling and uv disinfection each oxidation ditch has four carousel channels two outer channels usually under anoxic conditions and two inner channels under the influence of three surface aerators with aerobic conditions therefore allowing nitrification denitrification the sludge treatment line includes thickening of secondary sludge in two rotary drums and centrifuge dewatering of thickened sludge with previous dosing of a conditioning agent polyelectrolyte the pac as trials in fnw wwtp were conducted within the scope of the life impetus research project and after a wwtp baseline characterisation 2 5 year monitoring sept 2016 jan 2019 54 campaigns trial 1 occurred between march 25th and april 2nd 2019 8 days and trial 2 between april 2nd and april 12th 2019 10 days a sound comparison of pac as vs as operation requires similar operating conditions towards phc biodegradation and seasonality occurrence and operating conditions to understand to what extent seasonality affects phc occurrence in the wwtps influents a statistical analysis was conducted in an earlier study 5 and the maximum air temperature was identified as a key factor with a turning point of 22 c in this wwtp located in faro algarve where most days of precipitation corresponded to temperatures below 22 c 5 a similar statistical analysis of phc concentration variation in fnw wwtp secondary effluent demonstrated the nitrification effectiveness and the maximum air temperature were the two key variables with turning points for n total removal of 80 80 favouring phc biodegradation and 23 c 23 c with lower effluent concentrations 12 therefore the reference period for pac as performance considered the baseline data restricted to n removal and temperature conditions similar to those observed during the pac trials i e 80 and 23 c respectively the characterisation of fnw wwtp influent during the reference period and the pac as

monitored in fnw wwtp for 2 5 years within 2016 2019 namely caffeine acetaminophen ibuprofen naproxen diclofenac carbamazepine fluoxetine cortisone erythromycin sulfamethoxazole sulfapyridine sulfadizine bezafibrate clofibric acid atenolol metoprolol propranolol ethinylestradiol diethylstilbestrol 17 Î² estradiol estrone estriol gestodene and testosterone as detailed in silva et al 5 baseline analytical results were used to select the target phcs for this study those needing further treatment and were also taken as reference for the analysis of pac as results sixteen phcs were detected in all samples and for most phcs the concentrations were consistent with those found by others in portugal europe and worldwide 5 the monitoring results also showed that nine compounds were less prone to be removed by biodegradation and or solids sorption in the studied as reactors and were therefore the phcs targeted for enhanced removal by pac adsorption herein these included the recalcitrant diclofenac dcf and carbamazepine cbz and seven other phcs with intermediate and variable removals the antibiotics erythromycin ery sulfamethoxazole smx and sulfapyridine spd the beta blockers atenolol atn metoprolol mtpl and propranolol ppnl and the lipid regulator bezafibrate bzf target phcs median concentrations in secondary effluent of fnw wwtp during the reference period as well as their properties and method quantification limit mql are presented in table s2 supplementary information a median concentrations ranged between 37 ng l for bezafibrate and 1716 ng l for diclofenac carbamazepine propranolol and sulfamethoxazole showed concentrations aligned with other studies 43 44 47 while atenolol bezafibrate and metoprolol presented lower concentrations 43 44 48 for diclofenac concentrations were similar to those observed by margot et al 43 and lowenberg et al 48 but higher than in other studies 44 47 2 3 powdered activated carbon the commercial pac norit w35 from biomass a renewable source physically activated was selected to be used in the full scale demonstration tests after revealing a good performance towards the adsorption of 3 target phcs cbz dcf and smx during batch adsorption experiments adsorption kinetics and isotherms in synthetic and real wastewater with a pool of commercial and new waste based pacs 49 other determinant pac selection criteria were production from renewable resources good settleability cost effectiveness and mass availability for full scale tests limiting factor for the new waste based pacs pac w35 has a moderate specific surface area 790 m2 g and total pore volume 0 53 cm3 g relatively balanced between mesopore 2 50 nm pores and super micropore volumes 0 7 2 nm pores 0 28 cm3 g mesopores 0 23 cm3 g super micropores table s3 in supplementary information a and the samples used in the tests presented a neutral net charge phpzc of 8 secondary effluent average ph of 7 7 49 pac dosing should be conducted in a zone with good mixture but simultaneously with the lowest efom content for minimizing efom competition with phc for the adsorption sites samples collected in different zones of the oxidation ditch and more specifically nearby each of the three aerators showed no significant differences regarding a254 absorbance and dissolved organic carbon doc concentration which is consistent with an oxidation ditch operation therefore pac dosing was conducted next to the first aerator in the oxidation ditch line 2 yellow arrow in aerial photo in fig 1 to minimize the risk of a pac lost by short circuiting early pac purge from the ditch three stirred tanks with 900 l capacity each were used for preparing the pac slurry pac slurry was manually prepared every day at a concentration of 25 50 g l to ensure pac addition overnight hoppers specifically designed constructed and installed over the tanks allowed manually feeding the pac to the tanks pac slurry was prepared with dechlorinated water i e tap water after passing through granular activated carbon filters a centrifugal pump lowara co 350 05 assured the initial overdosing of pac slurry to the bioreactor for rapidly achieving steady state conditions and a peristaltic pump bredel apex 20 assured the pac continuous makeup during the trial pac dosing was flow proportional daily adjusting manually the pac slurry pump rate as a function of the inlet flowrate of the previous day 2 4 pac full scale trials two trials of pac slurry dosing into the oxidation ditch were conducted the first with 10 mg l pac trial 1 lasting 8 days the second with 25 mg l trial 2 lasting 10 days the trials were conducted under as operating conditions favouring phc biodegradation pac doses were based on a doc normalized pac dose of 2 8 mg pac mg doc obtained from previous pilot tests and within the range of literature 34 35 40 and a median doc concentration of 7 2 mg c l in secondary effluent 3 9 11 6 mg c l p5 p95 taken from a 2 5 year monitoring in fnw wwtp taking by reference those values it was anticipated that 11 32 mg l 20 mg l for the median doc would be necessary to further reduce the effluent concentration by 80 or above for atn and cbz and by at least 70 for dcf and smx the pac concentration profiles in the as reactor clarifier and recirculated sludge were predicted with transient state mass balances to the fnw wwtp using the software package scientist from micromath usa the predicted concentration profiles were calculated based on the historical average values of inlet flowrate recirculation ratio and sludge extraction fig 2a shows the planned pac concentration in the as reactor during the trials these variables were assessed daily and the pac dosing concentration was corrected based on the inlet flowrate of the previous day fig 2b the expected pac concentration profile in the as reactor fig 2a and the pac dosing concentration fig 2b were then determined from experimental data despite the high fluctuation in the inlet flowrate even though the inlet flowrate during the pac as trials falls under the p5 p99 percentile range of the 2016 2019 baseline period data a high convergence of the planned and expected pac concentration in the as reactor was achieved for the representativeness of the results obtained pac as trials were conducted in conditions as steady as possible for a working wwtp the trials began with a period of 4 7 h of initial pac overdosing to the as reactor to guarantee the rapid steady state of pac concentration in the oxidation ditch fig 2a after that overdosing period one aimed at keeping the continuous pac dosing of ca 10 mg l trial 1 or ca 25 mg l trial 2 during a period of several days the steady state pac concentration was planned to be achieved in 1 2 days first dashed vertical line in fig 2 and the steady state adsorption in the subsequent day second vertical dashed line in fig 2 after these two steady state conditions were reached a period of 6 8 days was ensured before the 24 h composite sampling for phc and other parameters analysis shaded areas in fig 2 during each sampling period the 4 day moving average approximately half the trial duration in steady state of the pac dosing concentration was calculated corresponding to values of 9 mg l and 11 mg l for the two sampling periods of the first trial and to 23 mg l and 29 mg l for the two sampling periods of the second trial fig 2b showing again values very close to the ones envisaged 2 5 analytical monitoring and operational control to investigate pac dosing impact on as regular operation samples were analysed for phcs and for a wide range of regular conventional and non conventional physical chemical parameters table s4 in supplementary information a dedicated analytical monitoring and operational control started two weeks before pac trials and lasted until 2 months after those trials after pac 2 m in this after pac period phcs were still monitored though the monitoring plan was simplified to be closer to the wwtp regular monitoring program an extended after pac period 2 m was considered for the analysis of the parameters related with suspended solids 2 months was the necessary time estimated by mass balance for the almost complete pac elimination from the wwtp as shown in fig s3 supplementary information a for assessing the compliance with discharge consents 125 mg o2 l cod 25 mg o2 l bod5 35 mg l tss 300 mpn 100 ml fecal coliforms the water utility collects 24 h composite samples except the grab samples for microbiology and this sampling procedure was adopted in this research project sampling once or twice a week included 24 h composite samples of wwtp influent fnw afb fig 1 and secondary effluent fnw ds s and grab samples of mixed liquor fnw vo ae 2 recirculation sludge fnw ri dewatered sludge fnw sd pac slurry and pac dosed as the daily variation of phcs determined in 24 h composite samples was found to be significant 45 the samples collected at the plant outlet hardly correspond to the treated water samples collected at the inlet of an extended aeration plant such as fnw wwtp with a 2016 2019 median hrt of 22 h consequently daily removals computed with the inlet and outlet concentrations of the same 24 h period hardly represent the plant performance keeping in mind the most important for health and environment is the reduction in discharge loads herein pac performance is assessed comparing secondary effluent concentration ranges with and without reference pac addition the term reduction is therefore used instead of removal to reflect the pac driven improvement in secondary effluent quality as no reference line for biological treatment e g parallel line without pac addition could be used at full scale we decided to take as reference for pac as impact the secondary effluent median concentrations for nine target phcs during the reference period identified in section 2 1 before pac addition table s2 in supplementary information a therefore the reference data correspond to the campaigns occurring under conditions similar to those observed in pac trials i e 80 n removal favouring phc biodegradation and 23 c maximum air temperature season 24 campaigns out of 54 monitoring campaigns conducted in 2016 2019 were therefore used for computing reference values pac impact on nitrification was assessed through ammonia and total nitrogen to analyse the clarification effectiveness pac particle retention was monitored using the secondary effluent quality in terms of turbidity

reduction potential orp turbidity settled sludge volume after 30 min settling sv30 and grey scale tracking the sv30 and the sludge volume index svi given by sv30 mlss are important indicators of the sedimentation performance of activated sludge the orp and do were daily controlled at the discharge point of the oxidation ditch aerobic zone due to the expected higher solids loading rates during pac as trials the plant operational control program included the monitoring of the daily flowrates of influent wastewater return sludge and sludge wasting the organic load the sludge retention time the sludge blanket height the hydraulic retention time and the energy consumption the energy consumption was measured 24 7 in each of the three aerators using 3 power energy loggers pel 103 with power and energy measurement every minute 2 6 analytical methods the analytical methods used are presented in table s5 supplementary information a and summarised herein phcs were quantified by solid phase extraction spe combined with optimised and previously validated liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms methods described in silva et al 5 which were adapted from those

spectrophotometric methods for uv absorbance at 254 nm a254 also known as uv254 colour as absorbance at 436 nm a436 and uv transmittance at 254 nm t254 the specific uv absorbance suva index defined as the ratio of 254 nm absorbance to doc concentration a well known surrogate of water organic matter aromaticity was used to estimate the pac effect on organic matter aromaticity the grey scale tracking was adapted from krahnstÃ¶ver and wintgens 39 2 7 statistical tests statistical tests using the past 4 03 program were conducted to assess the statistical significance p values of median concentration differences before during and after pac as full scale trials briefly one way anova homogeneous variance with levene s test or welch f test unequal variance were conducted for normal distributions and kruskal wallis test was used for not normal distributions shapiro wilk test p values 0 05 significance levels of 0 05 were applied 2 8 cost analysis methodology a comprehensive cost analysis of phc enhanced control via pac as was developed the cost analysis was based on cost functions adapted from viegas et al 51 and guerra and pellegrino 52 and using the cost elements and the technical and financial assumptions detailed in supplementary information b briefly the cost elements considered for opex operational expenditure were pac acquisition replacement of assets energy for pac mixing pumping and the pac related increments in maintenance personnel and sludge disposal costs table s8 the cost element considered for capex capital expenditure was the pac dosing system including the acquisition of equipment instrumentation and control and construction works table s8 3 results and discussion 3 1 impact of pac dosing on phc concentration in secondary effluent fig 3 shows plant intake orange brown bars and secondary effluent median concentrations orange bars of the nine target phcs for the reference period error bars depict p95 and p5 and for pac as trial 1 10 mg l pac and trial 2 25 mg l pac light grey and dark grey bars respectively error bars depict maximum and minimum values as there were not enough data for computing p5 p95 the reduction in phcs secondary effluent concentrations achieved during pac as trials is depicted in fig 4 and compared with other large scale studies when the compound s concentration was below the quantification limit mql the reduction value represented graphically was computed with the detection limit mql 3 the concentration reduction values were represented as a function of pac dose and not doc normalized pac doses due to the inexistence of doc values in some studies pac addition improved the secondary effluent quality for all phcs targeted except for bezafibrate fig 3 with 65 phc overall concentration reduction with 10 mg l pac and 73 with 25 mg l pac fig 4 bezafibrate reductions were notably absent in our study probably justified by its very low concentration in secondary effluent 37 ng l fig 3 very close to the quantification limit 33 2 ng l table s2 compared to the reference period 24 campaigns in 2016 2019 associated to equivalent season 23 c maximum air temperature and enhanced phc biodegradation n removal 80 during pac as trials 3 weeks in 2019 4 points for each dose effluent concentration reductions of 67 and 69 were obtained for the recalcitrant dcf and 63 and 83 for the recalcitrant cbz fig 4 for the two pac doses tested phc concentration reduction varied between 39 and 90 with 10 mg l pac and between 51 and 96 with 25 mg l and as expected depended on the compound well adsorbed compounds 80 were the positively charged erythromycin metoprolol and propranolol ppnl reductions presented in fig 4 are limited by the low concentrations in the reference period and concentrations below mql when dosing pac for the higher pac dose carbamazepine was also well adsorbed 80 for both doses the phc with the lowest reduction was smx hydrophilic negatively charged table s2 in supplementary information a overall the positively charged compounds were better adsorbed and for the higher pac dose also the neutral and relatively hydrophobic carbamazepine fig 4 this is in agreement with several other studies showing that the positively charged compounds present generally high adsorption onto activated carbons 43 44 53 55 which may be due to interactions with the electrons on the oxygen surface groups of the activated carbon 54 or with the background organic matter 43 and not so much related with their hydrophobicity degree the higher pac dose resulted in significantly lower concentrations in secondary effluent for atenolol carbamazepine and erythromycin p values 0 04 but no significant differences were observed for the other phcs p values 0 1 table s6 in supplementary information a this result is consistent with other studies showing a higher removal of organic micropollutants with pac dose increase though not all compounds benefiting to the same extent 55 indeed results of other large scale pac as studies in municipal wwtps presented in fig s4 supplementary information a show greater benefits for dfc and cbz compared to mtpl overall in this study both pac doses studied achieved not so different effluent concentrations for the target phcs although the higher dose yielded always more reliable and usually lower concentrations compared with other studies in our study the concentration reductions registered with 10 mg l pac are similar to those found by obrecht et al 34 for dcf 67 vs 65 68 and mtpl 81 vs 80 and lower for cbz 63 vs 80 and smx 39 vs 45 50 fig 4 full symbols this study vs open symbols 34 the same comparison with rÃ¶Ãler and metzger study 35 indicates similar results for smx but somewhat lower reductions in our study for cbz 63 83 vs 80 93 dcf 67 69 vs 52 82 and mtpl 81 88 vs 90 99 with 10 25 mg l pac fig 4 despite boehler et al 31 lÃ¼bken et al 32 and jagemann and lange 37 present phcs removal data from pac as large scale studies in municipal wwtps fig 4 a direct comparison with our study was not possible as no phc concentration data were found doc has a direct effect on pac consumption 40 and altmann et al 56 showed a close relationship between organic microcontaminants removal and doc normalized pac dose which might partially justify the differences observed no reference to doc normalized pac doses were found in rÃ¶Ãler and metzger 35 and 2 4 mg pac mg doc is referred in obrecht et al 34 as to fnw secondary effluent doc and a254 values registered during the first semester of 2019 covering the period of two weeks before pac as trials until two months after the trials were much higher than the median concentrations of the reference period and similar or higher than p95 and the maximum value fig s5 supplementary information a therefore doc normalized pac doses lower than the planned 2 8 mg pac mg doc were effectively used namely 0 7 1 mg pac mg doc in trial 1 and 1 8 2 6 mg pac mg doc in trial 2 besides the doc normalized pac doses other aspects such as pac characteristics and efom adsorbability determined by its size hydrophobicity and aromaticity should have also played a role in the differences found between our study and the published data phc concentration in secondary effluent during the after pac period i e after stopping pac as dosing was monitored for 2 months to evaluate a potential remaining capacity of the recirculating pac and to assess the system s return to the reference state fig 5 the corresponding phc concentrations at wwtp intake are compiled in table s7 supplementary information a during the after pac period phc concentration in secondary effluent significantly increased for almost all compounds comparing pac as trial 2 with after pac a significant difference in concentrations was observed for all phcs p values 0 02 except for bzf table s6 in supplementary information a comparing pac as trial 1 with after pac resulted in less significant differences in concentrations namely for compounds such as bzf cbz ery and smx with p values 0 09 nonetheless results also indicate phc removal performance does not break immediately after stopping pac dosing fig 5 while compounds such as cbz atn and bzf immediately increased their concentrations in the first two sampling campaigns of the after pac period 3 4 days and 11 12 days after pac stopping others such as mtpl ppnl dcf smx and spd showed a more progressive increase mostly marked after those two first campaigns this means during a period seemingly corresponding to pac retention time equal to sludge retention time 12 days median the activated carbon in the recirculated sludge was not fully exhausted for those compounds and could contribute to some removal this remaining capacity of the recirculating pac providing a buffer effect was also shown in other studies 34 35 though they only analysed a short period 2 7 days after pac shutdown obrecht et al 34 verified that two days after stopping pac dosing the concentration of the microcontaminants studied benzotriazole carbamazepine diclofenac clarithromycin metoprolol venlafaxine other than smx was still at least 50 lower than in the reference line based on experiments they concluded this returning pac capacity was important to explain why the removal performance did not decrease significantly during rain events rÃ¶Ãler and metzger 35 verified that one week after switching off pac dosing the poorly adsorbable compounds were indeed only adsorbed insignificantly around 20 for dcf and almost no removal for mecoprop and sulfamethoxazole while the concentrations of the well adsorbed substances such as benzotriazole and carbamazepine were still reduced by 45 they concluded the buffer effect decreases with increasing runtime and with compound adsorbability no buffer effect being detected for poorly adsorbable substances taking the example of cbz and smx our results did not exactly corroborate this latter conclusion and further research is necessary for clarification 3 2 impact of pac dosing on as regular operation pac impact on a wide range of regular water quality and operational control parameters are herein discussed the results for efom in terms of doc uv254 absorbance a254 suva and cod total and soluble is presented in table 1 pac effect in colour a436 and t254 is shown in fig 6 as previously referred during the period covering the pac as trials the secondary effluent presented doc and a254 values similar or higher than the p95 and the maximum values in the reference period 24 campaigns sept 2016 jan 2019 fig s5 the 2019 s values in the period before the pac addition were therefore assumed as references for comparison table 1 an efom effluent quality improvement during pac trials was observed with 17 29 lower values for total cod and ca 60 for soluble cod table 1 30 31 lower for doc and 35 44 for a254 table 1 and fig s5 doc results are in line with those obtained by margot et al 43 and mailler et al 44 with 14 20 mg l pac dosing to secondary effluent and long pac residence times comparing as and pac as values significant differences in medians were observed for all efom parameters p values 0 04 although no significant difference was verified between pac as trial 1 and trial 2 p values 0 1 it is well documented in the scientific literature that pac preferentially adsorbs small and aromatic organic matter which explains the higher removal of a254 when compared with doc suva the specific a254 absorbance computed from a254 doc was 6 20 lower as a strong linear correlation has been observed between suva and specific trihalomethane formation potential thmfp in secondary effluent 57 the results obtained suggest a reduction in the thmfp with pac application from march to june 2019 with no pac addition the secondary effluent presented a436 values true colour in the 1 7 2 3 m 1 range fig 6a a significant p values 9e 07 improvement was observed in pac as trials with a436 reductions of 42 with 10 mg l pac and 53 with 25 mg l pac dosing table 1 and fig 6a the substantial improvement was confirmed during in situ visual inspections not distant from tap water figs 7 and s6 also the secondary effluent transmittance clearly improved during pac as trials p value of 0 01 with p25 p75 increasing from 57 62 to 71 80 fig 6b though with no statistically significant difference between the two pac doses p value of 0 6 regarding the clarification effectiveness the turbidity of the secondary effluent varied between 1 ntu and 5 6 ntu fig 8a and the tss between 2 mg l and 14 mg l fig 8b in the first semester of 2019 the p25 p75 values for turbidity were 2 0 3 1 ntu before pac trials 1 5 3 5 ntu during pac trials 1 4 2 3 ntu and 1 4 3 2 ntu in the after pac period 2 m and 2 m respectively though a lower turbidity trend was observed in the 2 month period after pac trials the median values were not much different 2 5 ntu 1 8 ntu 1 7 ntu and 1 9 ntu neither the maximum values 4 8 ntu 5 6 ntu 4 1 ntu and 5 6 ntu and no significant differences were observed between these periods p values 0 06 during pac as trials and pac lifetime period effluent tss was 2 6 mg l and 3 5 mg l respectively with an outlier value of 14 mg l associated with precipitation events fig s2 and not distant from the maximum observed before pac trials 11 mg l the outlier value of turbidity in the after pac period 2 m 4 1 ntu was only verified at the end of may and therefore at the end of pac lifetime in the wwtp and is not correlated with pac carryover to secondary effluent in addition the 13 results from grey scale tracking showed only minor presence of pac fines in the secondary effluent average 0 6 0 7 mg l the highest value observed the day after the initial pac overdosing alum dosing to the as discharge into the secondary settler was prepared as a precautionary measure during pac as trials in case of persistent occurrence of pac fines in the secondary effluent yet no coagulant was necessary for pac fines control though our tests confirmed a good pac settleability in mixed liquor a large technical scale study in dry and rainy weather 34 confirmed a part of the activated sludge activated carbon mixture can be discharged from bioreactor during rainy events with a sand filter being effective for their retention a downstream filtration e g sand filter to prevent pac fines carryover to the treated water is therefore usually recommended for pac as applications 33 34 40 pac impact on nitrification phosphorus removal sludge production and settleability and energy consumption was also investigated some fluctuation in ammonia concentration was observed in the oxidation ditch and in the secondary effluent of fnw wwtp in the first semester of 2019 with some periods with lower nitrification ammonia values were 3 26 mg l nh4 before pac trials 3 28 mg l nh4 during pac dosing and 3 33 mg l nh4 in after pac with no significant differences between the three periods p values 0 11 this was in fact a key issue in fnw wwtp for improved phc biodegradation has been found to be associated with a nitrifying environment herein pac did not interfere with nitrification as n nh4 and n total regular profiles were maintained during pac dosing our results are therefore in agreement with those of zwickenpflug et al 33 and rÃ¶Ãler and metzger 35 the absence of inhibitory adsorbable substances in the municipal wastewater analysed with no relevant industrial input and the maintenance of sludge age during pac trials are consistent with the no effect observed the adsorption of nitrification toxic inhibitors was indicated as the main mechanism responsible for nitrification enhancement by pac 14 15 and the higher sludge extraction and subsequent reduced sludge age for nitrification inhibition 15 40 the average values of do and orp were 0 40 0 11 mg l and 126 30 mv with no pac dosing and 0 34 0 07 mg l and 155 82 mv with pac addition no significant changes p values 0 07 for do and p values 0 25 for orp being observed in addition the energy consumption for aeration during march june 2019 was also continuously monitored 24 h a day 7 days a week in each of the three aerators and compared with the wwtp baseline campaign conducted in 2017 during the 3 week pac as trials the measured energy consumption was 0 35 kwh m3 for aeration in an overall consumption of 0 80 kwh m3 the latter provided by the plant switchboard compared to the 2017 energy campaign the aeration consumption slightly decreased from 0 39 kwh m3 to 0 35 kwh m3 and the plant overall consumption matched the target 0 80 kwh m3 the estimated value to achieve an acceptable performance for a wwtp with nitrification and the fnw treated volume in 2019 the energy measurement was extended for two more months until 29th june and the results obtained were coherent with the energy baseline in sum pac did not interfere with nitrification n nh4 and n total regular profiles maintained oxidation reduction potential or dissolved oxygen in the oxidation ditch resulting in no energy consumption increase regarding total phosphorus whereas comparable influent concentrations in the reference period and during pac as trials were observed table s1 the concentration in secondary effluent was 0 6 3 4 mg l p median of 0 8 mg l in the period with no pac dosing and 0 6 0 8 mg l p median of 0 7 mg l during pac dosing these results point to an improvement in p control 19 reduction and corroborate spechia and gianetto 23 and serrano et al 45 results pac promoting the development of phosphorus accumulating organisms paos and or p adsorption onto pac are plausible mechanisms for p control serrano et al 45 observed a greater microbial diversity in activated sludge reactors with pac addition justifying the improved p removal with the detection of higher amounts of paos in reactor and or p adsorption onto pac though they did not specifically studied this latter possibility they reported studies with p adsorption onto other media e g sand dolomite and oyster shells pac dosing impact on mlss and svi fig 9 and sludge production fig 10 were evaluated during pac as full scale trials and compared with two periods in 2019 before and after pac trials mlss of 3100 mg l and 3400 mg l quartiles 1 and 3 were verified during pac as trials with a median value of 3250 mg l fig 9a although comparatively lower values were observed before and after pac as trials 2m and 2m ca 10 20 smaller with medians of 2943 mg l 2753 mg l and 2848 mg l respectively no significant statistical differences were obtained p values 0 08 moreover the mlss concentration was within the typical values for an oxidation ditch activated sludge with extended aeration 58 pac dosing was expected to increase the suspended solids inert in the as reactor 14 40 since no constant mlss mode of operation was adopted which would require higher sludge extraction in our study sludge extraction was not significantly changed and according to fig 2a pac dosing accounted for approximately 100 mg l and 250 mg l in pac as trial 1 and trial 2 respectively from may 2018 until march 2019 a period with no pac addition the median values of sv30 and svi were 590 ml l and 193 ml g fig 9b whereas during the 3 week pac as trials these average values were 640 ml l and 203 ml g respectively our results are in agreement with those of obrecht et al 34 and rÃ¶Ãler and metzger 35 which refer improvements only when the settling properties of activated sludge are very poor and or flocculant is used in our study good sludge settleability was observed both before and during pac dosing at fnw wwtp with no significant difference p value 0 30 no significant differences p value 0 48 were also found between pac and after pac periods data not shown finally the dewatered sludge production in fnw wwtp fig 10 expressed by the sludge produced wet weight per treated wastewater volume computed based on monthly averages was 1 87 kg m3 in the pre pac period 1 jan 22 march 2019 2 04 kg m3 during the pac trials and the pac lifetime period when pac was still in the system estimated by mass balance in approximately 2 months after stopping pac dosing as represented in fig s3 23 march 22 may 2019 and 1 90 kg m3 in the after pac period 23 may 30 june 2019 these results indicate an increase of 7 9 of sludge production during pac trials and are in agreement with those of zwickenpflug et al 33 the dewatered sludge showed a median dry weight of 16 in jan march 2019 before pac as trials 17 during the pac as trials and the pac lifetime period and 16 in jun aug after all pac was purged from the system statistic tests showed significant differences both between the first two periods before and during pac addition p value of 0 0007 and between the last two during and after pac dosing p value of 0 01 this means pac increased the final dewatered sludge quality mitigating the pac impact on sludge production by minimizing the increase of total sludge wet weight to be transported until final destination beneficial use these results are in agreement with other authors which concluded pac as might increase the solids loading rates in settling tanks and waste sludge produced 14 and or improve the sludge settling and dewatering properties 15 41 3 3 costs of pac as two pac dosing scenarios were considered for the cost analysis taking into account the results obtained these scenarios have in common the pac tested from vegetable renewable source physically activated and the pac dose of 20 mg l the latter corresponds to a doc normalized pac dose of 2 8 mg pac mg doc for the doc median observed during the 2 5 years baseline period i e 7 2 mg c l this dose though lower than the dose tested in the second pac as trial 25 mg l actually exceeds the two doc normalized pac doses tested 1 8 2 6 mg pac mg doc for an exceptionally higher doc was found during the pac as trials and is expected to achieve at least similar removal of two recalcitrant phcs cbz and dcf 80 on average the scenarios differ in the dosing period during the whole year or during the 6 month year period when phc concentrations are higher the latter was selected since higher phc concentrations e g cbz were found during the warmer months when the daily maximum air temperature in fnw was above 22 c 5 which corresponds to a period of 6 months per year the investment costs the annualised capital expenditure capex and the total costs capex opex were calculated and cost functions were built for each of the two scenarios considered table 2 as explained in supplementary information b as previously referred section 2 8 the cost elements considered for opex were pac acquisition replacement of assets energy for pac mixing pumping and the pac associated increments in maintenance personnel and sludge disposal costs the cost element considered for capex capital expenditure was the pac dosing system including the acquisition of equipment instrumentation and control and construction works figs 11 and 12 depict the costs and the costs breakdown versus the plant flowrate obtained for both scenarios for both scenarios the highest share of costs is due to pac acquisition which accounts for 58 85 of total costs depending on the pac dose dosing period and plant dimension it is also observed that the capex and replacement costs may be significant for small plants for all plant sizes pac related additional costs for sludge disposal are the second largest cost parcel particularly for pac continuous dosing fig 11 vs fig 12 all other costs energy maintenance and personnel are negligible furthermore it is observed that dosing pac for a 6 month year period allows a total cost saving of ca 40 solely due to opex reduction the above calculated costs for pac dosing to the as reactor for small plants 5000 m3 d and for larger plants 50 000 m3 d and for the two dosing scenarios considered were compared with literature values for this technological option and for other alternatives also referred as economically feasible for phc control in municipal wwtps i e granular activated carbon gac filtration and ozonation both as post treatments downstream the secondary treatment the estimated values for pac direct addition to as reactor 0 06 m3 fully agree with those obtained by baresel et al 59 further this option considering a continuous 12 months dosing scenario compares favourably with figures for pac post treatment from other studies 10 60 62 which reported costs of 0 16 0 34 m3 and of 0 07 0 18 m3 for small and for larger plants respectively regarding other technological options these costs compare similarly with post ozonation for which values of 0 03 0 10 m3 and of 0 04 0 05 m3 have been reported for small and for larger plants respectively 59 60 62 and compare favourably with gac post treatment for smaller plants 0 07 0 16 m3 and unfavourably with gac post treatment for larger plants 0 03 m3 10 59 considering the scenario where the need for phc control is reduced to 6 months per year pac dosing to the as reactor is the more cost efficient option with costs of 0 04 m3 for 5000 m3 d fig 12b and of 0 03 m3 above 35 000 m3 d plants 4 conclusions a 3 week full scale demo of pac direct dosing to as reactor oxidation ditch in fnw wwtp showed an improvement of the secondary effluent quality for the nine phcs targeted as compared with a reference period under similar conditions and with a broader 2 5 year baseline the phc concentration reductions were 39 90 with 10 mg l pac and 51 96 with 25 mg l depending on the phc for example 63 83 for carbamazepine and 67 69 for diclofenac two phcs recalcitrant to as treatment overall the positively charged compounds were better adsorbed the hydrophilic negatively charged sulfamethoxazole the poorest adsorbed and the higher pac dose yielded more reliable and usually lower residual concentrations phc monitoring in the after pac period 2 months after pac dosing shut down revealed the activated carbon in the return sludge presented a remaining adsorption capacity for some phcs during a period seemingly corresponding to pac retention time equal to sludge age after pac results also validated the representativeness of the results obtained during pac as trials for guiding long term wwtp operation a longer pac as testing period covering different seasons is nevertheless recommendable pac impact on a wide range of regular parameters and on as regular operation e g nitrification sludge production and settleability energy consumption was also investigated secondary effluent quality for total phosphorus colour organic matter and transmittance was enhanced with 0 7 2 6 mg pac mg doc and no pac interference with nitrification oxidation reduction potential or dissolved oxygen in the oxidation ditch was observed resulting in no energy consumption increase effluent turbidity total suspended solids and mixed liquor settleability presented also no relevant changes pac showed a positive effect on dewatered sludge dry weight and ultimately resulted in an apparent 7 9 increase in the final sludge production a cost analysis of pac enhanced treatment towards phc control via pac direct addition to the as reactor was developed estimated costs for this option fully compare favourably with pac and gac post treatment the latter for smaller plants and similarly with post ozonation finally the pac trials conducted at full scale in a municipal wwtp were very valuable

powdered activated carbon pac dosing to a conventional activated sludge as reactor is a low investment option for controlling pharmaceutical compounds phcs in municipal wastewater treatment but its advantages and limitations in real operating environments are not fully assessed a 3 week pac as full scale test was conducted in an oxidation ditch plant to assess pac impact on effluent quality phcs dissolved organic carbon doc and other parameters energy consumption sludge production and costs doc normalized pac doses of 0 7 2 6 mgpac mgdoc significantly reduced recalcitrant phc discharge e g by 63 83 for carbamazepine and 67 69 for diclofenac the higher dose yielding a more reliable effluent quality effluent quality for total phosphorus colour organic matter and transmittance was also enhanced and no interference with nitrification oxidation reduction potential or dissolved oxygen in the oxidation ditch was observed resulting in no energy consumption increase pac had no impact on effluent turbidity and mixed liquor suspended solids settleability showing a positive effect on dewatered sludge dry weight and ultimately a 7 9 increase on final sludge production after stopping pac dosing pac remaining in the return sludge presented adsorption capacity for some phcs until it was completely out of the system estimated costs for pac addition to as reactor compare favourably with literature data for pac and gac post treatment and similarly with post ozonation keywords pharmaceutical compounds powdered activated carbon municipal wastewater powdered activated carbon activated sludge cost analysis 1 introduction pharmaceutical compounds phcs problematic in water is being studied and monitored in many regions worldwide due to their potential toxicity genotoxicity or endocrine disruption 1 2 and there is a lack of knowledge regarding the exact extent of the problems they could cause particularly those related to synergetic and chronic effects 3 4 for instance in the european union fifteen phcs have been included at least once in the three water watch lists published so far commission implementing decisions eu 2015 4951 2018 840 and 2020 1161 and both the recently published directive eu 2020 2184 for drinking water and the new regulation on minimum requirements for water reuse for agricultural irrigation regulation eu 2020 741 refer to phc restrictions depending on the risk assessment outcome for example in portugal silva et al 5 recently showed caffeine analgesics and non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids such as acetaminophen ibuprofen naproxen and diclofenac to be the most abundant phcs in raw wastewater in two portuguese municipal wwtps at concentrations ranging from few ng l up to several hundreds of Î¼g l both wwtps presenting similar concentration ranges and consistent with those reviewed in other studies in portugal europe and worldwide wastewater treatment plants wwtps as one of the main hotspots of phc release into the aquatic environment 6 are crucial barriers against them the reported removal of phcs in urban activated sludge as wwtps is quite variable 0 to 98 much depending on contaminants properties and wwtp operating conditions 7 11 some of the most abundant phcs at wwtp inlet are usually highly removed during biological conventional treatment in wwtps e g caffein acetaminophen ibuprofen and naproxen while others present variable removals e g erythromycin sulfamethoxazole atenolol or are recalcitrant to treatment e g carbamazepine and diclofenac 7 9 12 therefore despite there are some operational strategies to enhance phc removal during biological treatment 7 9 which should be implemented whenever possible there will always be a group of compounds poorly removed eliminated in a wwtp with a typical secondary treatment and for which advanced treatment is necessary 8 besides ozone activated carbon adsorption either in its powdered pac or granular gac forms is considered a consolidated and cost efficient technology for controlling organic microcontaminants 10 13 pac is usually applied in suspension requiring a well mixed wastewater pac contact zone e g stirred contact tank and an efficient downstream process to retain pac particles pac dosing directly into a conventional as reactor pac as has the advantage of ensuring pac exhaustion very long pac residence time equal to the sludge age without requiring additional investment 14 nor increased energy consumption as no extra pumping is required for pac recirculation and pac particles are separated from the treated water together with the excess sludge pac as seems a key potential cost effective solution particularly for wwtps with no tertiary treatment infrastructure the simplest being flocculation and filtration since it is straightforward to implement and easy to adjust to wastewater quality variations despite these benefits pac as scientific literature mostly consists on studies at lab scale many with synthetic wastewater 15 22 or at pilot and full scale but focused on industrial wastewater 14 21 23 26 as corroborated by a literature survey conducted in web of science database with keywords such as pact activated carbon adsorption biological hybrid wastewater activated sludge activated carbon adsorption full scale wastewater powdered activated carbon biological treatment in fact quite a lot of research was conducted and published since the 1970s on pac as industrial applications actually pac as is also known as pact a process developed in the 1970s by the american company dupont to treat their chambers works chemical manufacturing wastewater rich in heavy metals and dyes highly coloured and with variable biodegradable and non biodegradable organics 25 pac as is considered a relatively proven technology to remove organic matter from wastewater in a number of industries e g textile pulp and paper pharmaceutical chemical and particularly petroleum refineries and petrochemical plant with the largest applications of this technology and landfill leachates 14 25 26 a synergistic effect was observed between biodegradation and pac adsorption with pac eliminating metabolic acidic products adverse effects and improving the biomass accumulation the metabolic activity and sludge settleability 21 however those effects may not be directly applicable to municipal wastewater treatment due to different wastewater characteristics and operational conditions pact application for industrial wastewater treatment has typically higher sludge retention times pac doses mixed liquor suspended solids and pac concentrations in aeration 14 25 26 focusing on large scale studies of phc removal from municipal wwtps a great number of recent papers on adsorption biological hybrid processes investigated suspended sludge membrane bioreactors pac mbr 27 29 typically with smaller floc size higher specific floc surface per unit of reactor volume and operating at higher biomass concentrations and sludge age than pac as 7 30 and therefore not necessarily comparable pac as performance is expected to vary with the activated sludge system as pac concentration in the mixed liquor which is of utmost importance for the process cost effectiveness was shown to be directly proportional to the influent pac dose and the sludge age and inversely related with the hydraulic retention time hrt 14 16 24 also a strong relationship was seen between dye removal and biomass concentration in pac as lab experiments 17 overall a limited number of pac as full scale data on phc removal from municipal wwtps is available 31 32 and most data published in technical reports and papers written in german 33 37 and or in recent literature reviewing some of those studies 28 38 reported median removals with pac as varied between 75 and 99 for atenolol 38 95 for carbamazepine 28 95 for diclofenac 60 98 for metoprolol and 29 95 for sulfamethoxazole with pac doses between 5 and 30 mg l some authors showing no linear removal increase with pac dose 31 32 34 35 37 pac dosing downstream the biological treatment has been frequently preferred in known full scale municipal wwtp applications due to the expected higher pac doses needed in pac as 39 in fact one of the major drawbacks of pac as is pointed to be the much stronger adsorption competition of the background effluent organic matter efom considered to be much higher in biopolymers and humic substances in the mixed liquor by comparison with the secondary effluent 31 39 after earlier pac as pilot experiments zwickenpflug et al 33 and boehler et al 31 concluded full scale pac as required twice the pac dose for downstream pac dosing with double mode namely 2 4 mg pac mg doc vs 1 2 mg pac mg doc however those differences have been narrowing in more recent literature for example 2 3 mg pac mg doc for pac as vs 1 3 mg pac mg doc for downstream pac dosing 34 35 40 further research is necessary since competition and required doses highly depend on the organic background matrix and therefore on the activated sludge system implemented and its operating conditions but also on finding where to dose pac into the secondary treatment in order to minimize efom competition 40 in addition pac dosing impact on regular as operation also needs to be better clarified for instance though a higher sludge settleability with pac addition has been reported by some authors 14 33 41 others 34 35 only referred improvements when the settling properties of activated sludge are very poor and or flocculant is used in addition a 5 20 sludge production increase has been reported 33 35 but this also depends on mixed liquor suspended solids concentration in the aeration tank mlss and on sludge extraction i e on the plant capacity to accommodate the increase in inert solids and on the pac impact on sludge settling and dewatering rÃ¶Ãler and metzger 35 worked with constant solids concentration in the as reactor and reported higher sludge extraction only with pac doses higher than 15 mg l on the other hand pac dosing influence on nitrification is also not consensual some authors reporting a benefit mostly due to inhibitors reduction 14 23 15 42 44 and others referring no effect 33 35 or a possible inhibition due to a higher sludge extraction and subsequent reduction of sludge age 40 pac as impact on phosphorus removal is also controversial with studies revealing an enhancement 23 45 while others showing no effect 20 37 or results depending on the activated carbon 46 altogether pac as calls for a higher operational experience in real municipal wwtp conditions particularly taking into account the variations in activated sludge systems and a wider knowledge transfer for the water practitioners to fully understand its advantages and limitations as an option for controlling organic microcontaminants and for optimising its implementation to understand how far can pac enhance the overall conventional activated sludge treatment maintaining low cost low energy and low sludge production a 3 week industrial demonstration of pac direct addition to the oxidation ditch of a portuguese urban wwtp faro nw wwtp was conducted two pac doses were tested and a total of 4 tons of pac were added this paper aims to assess the pac removal efficiency of a set of phcs less prone to biodegradation and or to solids sorption in the as reactors as well as to verify the pac dosing impact on a wide range of wastewater quality parameters and the energy consumption the sludge production and the costs as research strategy before pac dosing trials the wwtp baseline was characterized 2 5 years to understand which phcs needed further treatment as well as to evaluate the wwtp effectiveness for other wastewater quality parameters and its energy efficiency 2 materials and methods 2 1 faro nw wwtp and the definition of the reference period faro norwest fnw wwtp operated by Ã¡guas do algarve s a ada has a 13 221 m3 day installed capacity and covers mostly urban areas of loulÃ© and faro municipalities algarve portugal the wwtp was designed for 44 530 population equivalent receiving mostly domestic wastewater 85 from a combined sewage network that has 2 pumping stations 45 with overflow systems for rainy events during the research project duration 2016 2019 fnw wwtp treated 4525 m3 day average daily flowrate the wastewater treatment line fig 1 comprises a preliminary treatment with sieving and degritting degreasing two lines of biological treatment line 1 currently out of work with activated sludge in an extended aeration regime oxidation ditch and secondary settling and uv disinfection each oxidation ditch has four carousel channels two outer channels usually under anoxic conditions and two inner channels under the influence of three surface aerators with aerobic conditions therefore allowing nitrification denitrification the sludge treatment line includes thickening of secondary sludge in two rotary drums and centrifuge dewatering of thickened sludge with previous dosing of a conditioning agent polyelectrolyte the pac as trials in fnw wwtp were conducted within the scope of the life impetus research project and after a wwtp baseline characterisation 2 5 year monitoring sept 2016 jan 2019 54 campaigns trial 1 occurred between march 25th and april 2nd 2019 8 days and trial 2 between april 2nd and april 12th 2019 10 days a sound comparison of pac as vs as operation requires similar operating conditions towards phc biodegradation and seasonality occurrence and operating conditions to understand to what extent seasonality affects phc occurrence in the wwtps influents a statistical analysis was conducted in an earlier study 5 and the maximum air temperature was identified as a key factor with a turning point of 22 c in this wwtp located in faro algarve where most days of precipitation corresponded to temperatures below 22 c 5 a similar statistical analysis of phc concentration variation in fnw wwtp secondary effluent demonstrated the nitrification effectiveness and the maximum air temperature were the two key variables with turning points for n total removal of 80 80 favouring phc biodegradation and 23 c 23 c with lower effluent concentrations 12 therefore the reference period for pac as performance considered the baseline data restricted to n removal and temperature conditions similar to those observed during the pac trials i e 80 and 23 c respectively the characterisation of fnw wwtp influent during the reference period and the pac as trials is presented in table s1 supplementary information a being noticeable their comparable characteristics the as key operating conditions namely the organic load to microorganisms ratio f m sludge

monitored in fnw wwtp for 2 5 years within 2016 2019 namely caffeine acetaminophen ibuprofen naproxen diclofenac carbamazepine fluoxetine cortisone erythromycin sulfamethoxazole sulfapyridine sulfadizine bezafibrate clofibric acid atenolol metoprolol propranolol ethinylestradiol diethylstilbestrol 17 Î² estradiol estrone estriol gestodene and testosterone as detailed in silva et al 5 baseline analytical results were used to select the target phcs for this study those needing further treatment and were also taken as reference for the analysis of pac as results sixteen phcs were detected in all samples and for most phcs the concentrations were consistent with those found by others in portugal europe and worldwide 5 the monitoring results also showed that nine compounds were less prone to be removed by biodegradation and or solids sorption in the studied as reactors and were therefore the phcs targeted for enhanced removal by pac adsorption herein these included the recalcitrant diclofenac dcf and carbamazepine cbz and seven other phcs with intermediate and variable removals the antibiotics erythromycin ery sulfamethoxazole smx and sulfapyridine spd the beta blockers atenolol atn metoprolol mtpl and propranolol ppnl and the lipid regulator bezafibrate bzf target phcs median concentrations in secondary effluent of fnw wwtp during the reference period as well as their properties and method quantification limit mql are presented in table s2 supplementary information a median concentrations ranged between 37 ng l for bezafibrate and 1716 ng l for diclofenac carbamazepine propranolol and sulfamethoxazole showed concentrations aligned with other studies 43 44 47 while atenolol bezafibrate and metoprolol presented lower concentrations 43 44 48 for diclofenac concentrations were similar to those observed by margot et al 43 and lowenberg et al 48 but higher than in other studies 44 47 2 3 powdered activated carbon the commercial pac norit w35 from biomass a renewable source physically activated was selected to be used in the full scale demonstration tests after revealing a good performance towards the adsorption of 3 target phcs cbz dcf and smx during batch adsorption experiments adsorption kinetics and isotherms in synthetic and real wastewater with a pool of commercial and new waste based pacs 49 other determinant pac selection criteria were production from renewable resources good settleability cost effectiveness and mass availability for full scale tests limiting factor for the new waste based pacs pac w35 has a moderate specific surface area 790 m2 g and total pore volume 0 53 cm3 g relatively balanced between mesopore 2 50 nm pores and super micropore volumes 0 7 2 nm pores 0 28 cm3 g mesopores 0 23 cm3 g super micropores table s3 in supplementary information a and the samples used in the tests presented a neutral net charge phpzc of 8 secondary effluent average ph of 7 7 49 pac dosing should be conducted in a zone with good mixture but simultaneously with the lowest efom content for minimizing efom competition with phc for the adsorption sites samples collected in different zones of the oxidation ditch and more specifically nearby each of the three aerators showed no significant differences regarding a254 absorbance and dissolved organic carbon doc concentration which is consistent with an oxidation ditch operation therefore pac dosing was conducted next to the first aerator in the oxidation ditch line 2 yellow arrow in aerial photo in fig 1 to minimize the risk of a pac lost by short circuiting early pac purge from the ditch three stirred tanks with 900 l capacity each were used for preparing the pac slurry pac slurry was manually prepared every day at a concentration of 25 50 g l to ensure pac addition overnight hoppers specifically designed constructed and installed over the tanks allowed manually feeding the pac to the tanks pac slurry was prepared with dechlorinated water i e tap water after passing through granular activated carbon filters a centrifugal pump lowara co 350 05 assured the initial overdosing of pac slurry to the bioreactor for rapidly achieving steady state conditions and a peristaltic pump bredel apex 20 assured the pac continuous makeup during the trial pac dosing was flow proportional daily adjusting manually the pac slurry pump rate as a function of the inlet flowrate of the previous day 2 4 pac full scale trials two trials of pac slurry dosing into the oxidation ditch were conducted the first with 10 mg l pac trial 1 lasting 8 days the second with 25 mg l trial 2 lasting 10 days the trials were conducted under as operating conditions favouring phc biodegradation pac doses were based on a doc normalized pac dose of 2 8 mg pac mg doc obtained from previous pilot tests and within the range of literature 34 35 40 and a median doc concentration of 7 2 mg c l in secondary effluent 3 9 11 6 mg c l p5 p95 taken from a 2 5 year monitoring in fnw wwtp taking by reference those values it was anticipated that 11 32 mg l 20 mg l for the median doc would be necessary to further reduce the effluent concentration by 80 or above for atn and cbz and by at least 70 for dcf and smx the pac concentration profiles in the as reactor clarifier and recirculated sludge were predicted with transient state mass balances to the fnw wwtp using the software package scientist from micromath usa the predicted concentration profiles were calculated based on the historical average values of inlet flowrate recirculation ratio and sludge extraction fig 2a shows the planned pac concentration in the as reactor during the trials these variables were assessed daily and the pac dosing concentration was corrected based on the inlet flowrate of the previous day fig 2b the expected pac concentration profile in the as reactor fig 2a and the pac dosing concentration fig 2b were then determined from experimental data despite the high fluctuation in the inlet flowrate even though the inlet flowrate during the pac as trials falls under the p5 p99 percentile range of the 2016 2019 baseline period data a high convergence of the planned and expected pac concentration in the as reactor was achieved for the representativeness of the results obtained pac as trials were conducted in conditions as steady as possible for a working wwtp the trials began with a period of 4 7 h of initial pac overdosing to the as reactor to guarantee the rapid steady state of pac concentration in the oxidation ditch fig 2a after that overdosing period one aimed at keeping the continuous pac dosing of ca 10 mg l trial 1 or ca 25 mg l trial 2 during a period of several days the steady state pac concentration was planned to be achieved in 1 2 days first dashed vertical line in fig 2 and the steady state adsorption in the subsequent day second vertical dashed line in fig 2 after these two steady state conditions were reached a period of 6 8 days was ensured before the 24 h composite sampling for phc and other parameters analysis shaded areas in fig 2 during each sampling period the 4 day moving average approximately half the trial duration in steady state of the pac dosing concentration was calculated corresponding to values of 9 mg l and 11 mg l for the two sampling periods of the first trial and to 23 mg l and 29 mg l for the two sampling periods of the second trial fig 2b showing again values very close to the ones envisaged 2 5 analytical monitoring and operational control to investigate pac dosing impact on as regular operation samples were analysed for phcs and for a wide range of regular conventional and non conventional physical chemical parameters table s4 in supplementary information a dedicated analytical monitoring and operational control started two weeks before pac trials and lasted until 2 months after those trials after pac 2 m in this after pac period phcs were still monitored though the monitoring plan was simplified to be closer to the wwtp regular monitoring program an extended after pac period 2 m was considered for the analysis of the parameters related with suspended solids 2

liquor fnw vo ae 2 recirculation sludge fnw ri dewatered sludge fnw sd pac slurry and pac dosed as the daily variation of phcs determined in 24 h composite samples was found to be significant 45 the samples collected at the plant outlet hardly correspond to the treated water samples collected at the inlet of an extended aeration plant such as fnw wwtp with a 2016 2019 median hrt of 22 h consequently daily removals computed with the inlet and outlet concentrations of the same 24 h period hardly represent the plant performance keeping in mind the most important for health and environment is the reduction in discharge loads herein pac performance is assessed comparing secondary effluent concentration ranges with and without reference pac addition the term reduction is therefore used instead of removal to reflect the pac driven improvement in secondary effluent quality as no reference line for biological treatment e g parallel line without pac addition could be used at full scale we decided to take as reference for pac as impact the secondary effluent median concentrations for nine target phcs during the reference period identified in section 2 1 before pac addition table s2 in supplementary information a therefore the reference data correspond to the campaigns occurring under conditions similar to those observed in pac trials i e 80 n removal favouring phc biodegradation and 23 c maximum air temperature season 24 campaigns out of 54 monitoring campaigns conducted in 2016 2019 were therefore used for computing reference values pac impact on

enhanced control via pac as was developed the cost analysis was based on cost functions adapted from viegas et al 51 and guerra and pellegrino 52 and using the cost elements and the technical and financial assumptions detailed in supplementary information b briefly the cost elements considered for opex operational expenditure were pac acquisition replacement of assets energy for pac mixing pumping and the pac related increments in maintenance personnel and sludge disposal costs table s8 the cost element considered for capex capital expenditure was the pac dosing system including the acquisition of equipment instrumentation and control and construction works table s8 3 results and discussion 3 1 impact of pac dosing on phc concentration in secondary effluent fig 3 shows plant intake orange brown bars and secondary effluent median concentrations orange bars of the nine target phcs for the reference period error bars depict p95 and p5 and for pac as trial 1 10 mg l pac and trial 2 25 mg l pac light grey and dark grey bars respectively error bars depict maximum and minimum values as there were not enough data for computing p5 p95 the reduction in phcs secondary effluent concentrations achieved during pac as trials is depicted in fig 4 and compared with other large scale studies when the compound s concentration was below the quantification limit mql the reduction value represented graphically was computed with the detection limit mql 3 the concentration reduction values were represented as a function of pac dose and not doc normalized pac doses due to the inexistence of doc values in some studies pac addition improved the secondary effluent quality for all phcs targeted except for bezafibrate fig 3 with 65 phc overall concentration reduction with 10 mg l pac and 73 with 25 mg l pac fig 4 bezafibrate reductions were notably absent in our study probably justified by its very low concentration in secondary effluent 37 ng l fig 3 very close to the quantification limit 33 2 ng l table s2 compared to the reference period 24 campaigns in 2016 2019 associated to equivalent season 23 c maximum air temperature and enhanced phc biodegradation n removal 80 during pac as trials 3 weeks in 2019 4 points for each dose effluent concentration reductions of 67 and 69 were obtained for the recalcitrant dcf and 63 and 83 for the recalcitrant cbz fig 4 for the two pac doses tested phc concentration reduction varied between 39 and 90 with 10 mg l pac and between 51 and 96 with 25 mg l and as expected depended on the compound well adsorbed compounds 80 were the positively charged erythromycin metoprolol and propranolol ppnl reductions presented in fig 4 are limited by the low concentrations in the reference period and concentrations below mql when dosing pac for the higher pac dose carbamazepine was also well adsorbed 80 for both doses the phc with the lowest reduction was smx hydrophilic negatively charged table s2 in supplementary information a overall the positively charged compounds were better adsorbed and for the higher pac dose also the neutral and relatively hydrophobic carbamazepine fig 4 this is in agreement with several other studies showing that the positively charged compounds present generally high adsorption onto activated carbons 43 44 53 55 which may be due to interactions with the electrons on the oxygen surface groups of the activated carbon 54 or with the background organic matter 43 and not so much related with their hydrophobicity degree the higher pac dose resulted in significantly lower concentrations in secondary effluent for atenolol carbamazepine and erythromycin p values 0 04 but no significant differences were observed for the other phcs p values 0 1 table s6 in supplementary information a this result is consistent with other studies showing a higher removal of organic micropollutants with pac dose increase though not all compounds benefiting to the same extent 55 indeed results of other large scale pac as studies in municipal wwtps presented in fig s4 supplementary information a show greater benefits for dfc and cbz compared to mtpl overall in this study both pac doses studied achieved not so different effluent concentrations for the target phcs although the higher dose yielded always more reliable and usually lower concentrations compared with other studies in our study the concentration reductions registered with 10 mg l pac are similar to those found by obrecht et al 34 for dcf 67 vs 65 68 and mtpl 81 vs 80 and lower for cbz 63 vs 80 and smx 39 vs 45 50 fig 4 full symbols this study vs open symbols 34 the same comparison with rÃ¶Ãler and metzger study 35 indicates similar results for smx but somewhat lower reductions in our study for cbz 63 83 vs 80 93 dcf 67 69 vs 52 82 and mtpl 81 88 vs 90 99 with 10 25 mg l pac fig 4 despite boehler et al 31 lÃ¼bken et al 32 and jagemann and lange 37 present phcs removal data from pac as large scale studies in municipal wwtps fig 4 a direct comparison with our study was not possible as no phc concentration data were found doc has a direct effect on pac consumption 40 and altmann et al 56 showed a close relationship between organic microcontaminants removal and doc normalized pac dose which might partially justify the differences observed no reference to doc normalized pac doses were found in rÃ¶Ãler and metzger 35 and 2 4 mg pac mg doc is referred in obrecht et al 34 as to fnw secondary effluent doc and a254 values registered during the first semester of 2019 covering the period of two weeks before pac as trials until two months after the trials were much higher than the median concentrations of the reference period and similar or higher than p95 and the maximum value fig s5 supplementary information a therefore doc normalized pac doses lower than the planned 2 8 mg pac mg doc were effectively used namely 0 7 1 mg pac mg doc in trial 1 and 1 8 2 6 mg pac mg doc in trial 2 besides the doc normalized pac doses other aspects such as pac characteristics and efom adsorbability determined by its size hydrophobicity and aromaticity should have also played a role in the differences found between our study and the published data phc concentration in secondary effluent during the after pac period i e after stopping pac as dosing was monitored for 2 months to evaluate a potential remaining capacity of the recirculating pac and to assess the system s return to the reference state fig 5 the corresponding phc concentrations at wwtp intake are compiled in table s7 supplementary information a during the after pac period phc concentration in secondary effluent significantly increased for almost all compounds comparing pac as trial 2 with after pac a significant difference in concentrations was observed for all phcs p values 0 02 except for bzf table s6 in supplementary information a comparing pac as trial 1 with after pac resulted in less significant differences in concentrations namely for compounds such as bzf cbz ery and smx with p values 0 09 nonetheless results also indicate phc removal performance does not break immediately after stopping pac dosing fig 5 while compounds such as cbz atn and bzf immediately increased their concentrations in the first two sampling campaigns of the after pac period 3 4 days and 11 12 days after pac stopping others such as mtpl ppnl dcf smx and spd showed a more progressive increase mostly marked after those two first campaigns this means during a period seemingly corresponding to pac retention time equal to sludge retention time 12 days median the activated carbon in the recirculated sludge was not fully exhausted for those compounds and could contribute to some removal this remaining capacity of the recirculating pac providing a buffer effect was also shown in other studies 34 35 though they only analysed a short period 2 7 days after pac shutdown obrecht et al 34 verified that two days after stopping pac dosing the concentration of the microcontaminants studied benzotriazole carbamazepine diclofenac clarithromycin metoprolol venlafaxine other than smx was still at least 50 lower than in the reference line based on experiments they concluded this returning pac capacity was important to explain why the removal performance did not decrease significantly during rain events rÃ¶Ãler and metzger 35 verified that one week after switching off pac dosing the poorly adsorbable compounds were indeed only adsorbed insignificantly around 20 for dcf and almost no removal for mecoprop and sulfamethoxazole while the concentrations of the well adsorbed substances such as benzotriazole and carbamazepine were still reduced by 45 they concluded the buffer effect decreases with increasing runtime and with compound adsorbability no buffer effect being detected for poorly adsorbable substances taking the example of cbz and smx our results did not exactly corroborate this latter conclusion and further research is necessary for clarification 3 2 impact of pac dosing on as regular operation pac impact on a wide range of regular water quality and operational control parameters are herein discussed the results for efom in terms of doc uv254 absorbance a254 suva and cod total and soluble is presented in table 1 pac effect in colour a436 and t254 is shown in fig 6 as previously referred during the period covering the pac as trials the secondary effluent presented doc and a254 values similar or higher than the p95 and the maximum values in the reference period 24 campaigns sept 2016 jan 2019 fig s5 the 2019 s values in the period before the pac addition were therefore assumed as references for comparison table 1 an efom effluent quality improvement during pac trials was observed with 17 29 lower values for total cod and ca 60 for soluble cod table 1 30 31 lower for doc and 35 44 for a254 table 1 and fig s5 doc results are in line with those obtained by margot et al 43 and mailler et al 44 with 14 20 mg l pac dosing to secondary effluent and long pac residence times comparing as and pac as values significant differences in medians were observed for all efom parameters p values 0 04 although no significant difference was verified between pac as trial 1 and trial 2 p values 0 1 it is well documented in the scientific literature that pac preferentially adsorbs small and aromatic organic matter which explains the higher removal of a254 when compared with doc suva the specific a254 absorbance computed from a254 doc was 6 20 lower as a strong linear correlation has been observed between suva and specific trihalomethane formation potential thmfp in secondary effluent 57 the results obtained suggest a reduction in the thmfp with pac application from march to june 2019 with no pac addition the secondary effluent presented a436 values true colour in the 1 7 2 3 m 1 range fig 6a a significant p values 9e 07 improvement was observed in pac as trials with a436 reductions of 42 with 10 mg l pac and 53 with 25 mg l pac dosing table 1 and fig 6a the substantial improvement was confirmed during in situ visual inspections not distant from tap water figs 7 and s6 also the secondary effluent transmittance clearly improved during pac as trials p value of 0 01 with p25 p75 increasing from 57 62 to 71 80 fig 6b though with no statistically significant difference between the two pac doses p value of 0 6 regarding the clarification effectiveness the turbidity of the secondary effluent varied between 1 ntu and 5 6 ntu fig 8a and the tss between 2 mg l and 14 mg l fig 8b in the first semester of 2019 the p25 p75 values for turbidity were 2 0 3 1 ntu before pac trials 1 5 3 5 ntu during pac trials 1 4 2 3 ntu and 1 4 3 2 ntu in the after pac period 2 m and 2 m respectively though a lower turbidity trend was observed in the 2 month period after pac trials the median values were not much different 2 5 ntu 1 8 ntu 1 7 ntu and 1 9 ntu neither the maximum values 4 8 ntu 5 6 ntu 4 1 ntu and 5 6 ntu and no significant differences were observed between these periods p values 0 06 during pac as trials and pac lifetime period effluent tss was 2 6 mg l and 3 5 mg l respectively with an outlier value of 14 mg l associated with precipitation events fig s2 and not distant from the maximum observed before pac trials 11 mg l the outlier value of turbidity in the after pac period 2 m 4 1 ntu was only verified at the end of may and therefore at the end of pac lifetime in the wwtp and is not correlated with pac carryover to secondary effluent in addition the 13 results from grey scale tracking showed only minor presence of pac fines in the secondary effluent average 0 6 0 7 mg l the highest value observed the day after the initial pac overdosing alum dosing to the as discharge into the secondary settler was prepared as a precautionary measure during pac as trials in case of persistent occurrence of pac fines in the secondary effluent yet no coagulant was necessary for pac fines control though our tests confirmed a good pac settleability in mixed liquor a large technical scale study in dry and rainy weather 34 confirmed a part of the activated sludge activated carbon mixture can be discharged from bioreactor during rainy events with a sand filter being effective for their retention a downstream filtration e g sand filter to prevent pac fines carryover to the treated water is therefore usually recommended for pac as applications 33 34 40 pac impact on nitrification phosphorus removal sludge production and settleability and energy consumption was also investigated some fluctuation in ammonia concentration was observed in the oxidation ditch and in the secondary effluent of fnw wwtp in the first semester of 2019 with some periods with lower nitrification ammonia values were 3 26 mg l nh4 before pac trials 3 28 mg l nh4 during pac dosing and 3 33 mg l nh4 in after pac with no significant differences between the three periods p values 0 11 this was in fact a key issue in fnw wwtp for improved phc biodegradation has been found to be associated with a nitrifying environment herein pac did not interfere with nitrification as n nh4 and n total regular profiles were maintained during pac dosing our results are therefore in agreement with those of zwickenpflug et al 33 and rÃ¶Ãler and metzger 35 the absence of inhibitory adsorbable substances in the municipal wastewater analysed with no relevant industrial input and the maintenance of sludge age during pac trials are consistent with the no effect observed the adsorption of nitrification toxic inhibitors was indicated as the main mechanism responsible for nitrification enhancement by pac 14 15 and the higher sludge extraction and subsequent reduced sludge age for nitrification inhibition 15 40 the average values of do and orp were 0 40 0 11 mg l and 126 30 mv with no pac dosing and 0 34 0 07 mg l and 155 82 mv with pac addition no significant changes p values 0 07 for do and p values 0 25 for orp being observed in addition the energy consumption for aeration during march june 2019 was also continuously monitored 24 h a day 7 days a week in each of the three aerators and compared with the wwtp baseline campaign conducted in 2017 during the 3 week pac as trials the measured energy consumption was 0 35 kwh m3 for aeration in an overall consumption of 0 80 kwh m3 the latter provided by the plant switchboard compared to the 2017 energy campaign the aeration consumption slightly decreased from 0 39 kwh m3 to 0 35 kwh m3 and the plant overall consumption matched the target 0 80 kwh m3 the estimated value to achieve an acceptable performance for a wwtp with nitrification and the fnw treated volume in 2019 the energy measurement was extended for two more months until 29th june and the results obtained were coherent with the energy baseline in sum pac did not interfere with nitrification n nh4 and n total regular profiles maintained oxidation reduction potential or dissolved oxygen in the oxidation ditch resulting in no energy consumption increase regarding total phosphorus whereas comparable influent concentrations in the reference period and during pac as trials were observed table s1 the concentration in secondary effluent was 0 6 3 4 mg l p median of 0 8 mg l in the period with no pac dosing and 0 6 0 8 mg l p median of 0 7 mg l during pac dosing these results point to an improvement in p control 19 reduction and corroborate spechia and gianetto 23 and serrano et al 45 results pac promoting the development of phosphorus accumulating organisms paos and or p adsorption onto pac are plausible mechanisms for p control serrano et al 45 observed a greater microbial diversity in activated sludge reactors with pac addition justifying the improved p removal with the detection of higher amounts of paos in reactor and or p adsorption onto pac though they did not specifically studied this latter possibility they reported studies with p adsorption onto other media e g sand dolomite and oyster shells pac dosing impact on mlss and svi fig 9 and sludge production fig 10 were evaluated during pac as full scale trials and compared with two periods in 2019 before and after pac trials mlss of 3100 mg l and 3400 mg l quartiles 1 and 3 were verified during pac as trials with a median value of 3250 mg l fig 9a although comparatively lower values were observed before and after pac as trials 2m and 2m ca 10 20 smaller with medians of 2943 mg l 2753 mg l and 2848 mg l respectively no significant statistical differences were obtained p values 0 08 moreover the mlss concentration was within the typical values for an oxidation ditch activated sludge with extended aeration 58 pac dosing was expected to increase the suspended solids inert in the as reactor 14 40 since no constant mlss mode of operation was adopted which would require higher sludge extraction in our study sludge extraction was not significantly changed and according to fig 2a pac dosing accounted for approximately 100 mg l and 250 mg l in pac as trial 1 and trial 2 respectively from may 2018 until march 2019 a period with no pac addition the median values of sv30 and svi were 590 ml l and 193 ml g fig 9b whereas during the 3 week pac as trials these average values were 640 ml l and 203 ml g respectively our results are in agreement with those of obrecht et al 34 and rÃ¶Ãler and metzger 35 which refer improvements only when the settling properties of activated sludge are very poor and or flocculant is used in our study good sludge settleability was observed both before and during pac dosing at fnw wwtp with no significant difference p value 0 30 no significant differences p value 0 48 were also found between pac and after pac periods data not shown finally the dewatered sludge production in fnw wwtp fig 10 expressed by the sludge produced wet weight per treated wastewater volume computed based on monthly averages was 1 87 kg m3 in the pre pac period 1 jan 22 march 2019 2 04 kg m3 during the pac trials and the pac lifetime period when pac was still in the system estimated by mass balance in approximately 2 months after stopping pac dosing as represented in fig s3 23 march 22 may 2019 and 1 90 kg m3 in the after pac period 23 may 30 june 2019 these results indicate an increase of 7 9 of sludge production during pac trials and are in agreement with those of zwickenpflug et al 33 the dewatered sludge showed a median dry weight of 16 in jan march 2019 before pac as trials 17 during the pac as trials and the pac lifetime period and 16 in jun aug after all pac was purged from the system statistic tests showed significant differences both between the first two periods before and during pac addition p value of 0 0007 and between the last two during and after pac dosing p value of 0 01 this means pac increased the final dewatered sludge quality mitigating the pac impact on sludge production by minimizing the increase of total sludge wet weight to be transported until final destination beneficial use these results are in agreement with other authors which concluded pac as might increase the solids loading rates in settling tanks and waste sludge produced 14 and or improve the sludge settling and dewatering properties 15 41 3 3 costs of pac as two pac dosing scenarios were considered for the cost analysis taking into account the results obtained these scenarios have in common the pac tested from vegetable renewable source physically activated and the pac dose of 20 mg l the latter corresponds to a doc normalized pac dose of 2 8 mg pac mg doc for the doc median observed during the 2 5 years baseline period i e 7 2 mg c l this dose though lower than the dose tested in the second pac as trial 25 mg l actually exceeds the two doc normalized pac doses tested 1 8 2 6 mg pac mg doc for an exceptionally higher doc was found during the pac as trials and is expected to achieve at least similar removal of two recalcitrant phcs cbz and dcf 80 on average the scenarios differ in the dosing period during the whole year or during the 6 month year period when phc concentrations are higher the latter was selected since higher phc concentrations e g cbz were found during the warmer months when the daily maximum air temperature in fnw was above 22 c 5 which corresponds to a period of 6 months per year the investment costs the annualised capital expenditure capex and the total costs capex opex were calculated and cost functions were built for each of the two scenarios considered table 2 as explained in supplementary information b as previously referred section 2 8 the cost elements considered for opex were pac acquisition replacement of assets energy for pac mixing pumping and the pac associated increments in maintenance personnel and sludge disposal costs the cost element considered for capex capital expenditure was the pac dosing system including the acquisition of equipment instrumentation and control and construction works figs 11 and 12 depict the costs and the costs breakdown versus the plant flowrate obtained for both scenarios for both scenarios the highest share of costs is due to pac acquisition which accounts for 58 85 of total costs depending on the pac dose dosing period and plant dimension it is also observed that the capex and replacement costs may be significant for small plants for all plant sizes pac related additional costs for sludge disposal are the second largest cost parcel particularly for pac continuous dosing fig 11 vs fig 12 all other costs energy maintenance and personnel are negligible furthermore it is observed that dosing pac for a 6 month year period allows a total cost saving of ca 40 solely due to opex reduction the above calculated costs for pac dosing to the as reactor for small plants 5000 m3 d and for larger plants 50 000 m3 d and for the two dosing scenarios considered were compared with literature values for this technological option and for other alternatives also referred as economically feasible for phc control in municipal wwtps i e granular activated carbon gac filtration and ozonation both as post treatments downstream the secondary treatment the estimated values for pac direct addition to as reactor 0 06 m3 fully agree with those obtained by baresel et al 59 further this option considering a continuous 12 months dosing scenario compares favourably with figures for pac post treatment from other studies 10 60 62 which reported costs of 0 16 0 34 m3 and of 0 07 0 18 m3 for small and for larger plants respectively regarding other technological options these costs compare similarly with post ozonation for which values of 0 03 0 10 m3 and of 0 04 0 05 m3 have been reported for small and for larger plants respectively 59 60 62 and compare favourably with gac post treatment for smaller plants 0 07 0 16 m3 and unfavourably with gac post treatment for larger plants 0 03 m3 10 59 considering the scenario where the need for phc control is reduced to 6 months per year pac dosing to the as reactor is the more cost efficient option with costs of 0 04 m3 for 5000 m3 d fig 12b and of 0 03 m3 above 35 000 m3 d plants 4 conclusions a 3 week full scale demo of pac direct dosing to as reactor oxidation ditch in fnw wwtp showed an improvement of the secondary effluent quality for the nine phcs targeted as compared with a reference period under similar conditions and with a broader 2 5 year baseline the phc concentration reductions were 39 90 with 10 mg l pac and 51 96 with 25 mg l depending on the phc for example 63 83 for carbamazepine and 67 69 for diclofenac two phcs recalcitrant to as treatment overall the positively charged compounds were better adsorbed the hydrophilic negatively charged sulfamethoxazole the poorest adsorbed and the higher pac dose yielded more reliable and usually lower residual concentrations phc monitoring in the after pac period 2 months after pac dosing shut down revealed the activated carbon in the return sludge presented a remaining adsorption capacity for some phcs during a period seemingly corresponding to pac retention time equal to sludge age after pac results also validated the representativeness of the results obtained during pac as trials for guiding long term wwtp operation a longer pac as testing period covering different seasons is nevertheless recommendable pac impact on a wide range of regular parameters and on as regular operation e g nitrification sludge production and settleability energy consumption was also investigated secondary effluent quality for total phosphorus colour organic matter and transmittance was enhanced with 0 7 2 6 mg pac mg doc and no pac interference with nitrification oxidation reduction potential or dissolved oxygen in the oxidation ditch was observed resulting in no energy consumption increase effluent turbidity total suspended solids and mixed liquor settleability presented also no relevant changes pac showed a positive effect on dewatered sludge dry weight and ultimately resulted in an apparent 7 9 increase in the final sludge production a cost analysis of pac enhanced treatment towards phc control via pac direct addition to the as reactor was developed estimated costs for this option fully compare favourably with pac and gac post treatment the latter for smaller plants and similarly with post ozonation finally the pac trials conducted at full scale in a municipal wwtp were very valuable

pollutants and sludge characteristics indicator were tested at the segmental influent flow distribution ratio of a1 o1 2 1 the study showed that the removal rates of chemical oxygen demand cod ammonia nitrogen nh4 n total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp were 89 90 74 76 60 and 96 60 in contrast to the conventional aao process at low temperature cod degradation was concentrated in a1 and o1 simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd occurred in o1 to achieve effective n removal the phosphorus p significant removal in o1 the extracellular polymeric substances eps content of activated sludge in the compartment was negatively correlated with the incoming cod content and the distribution of carbon and nitrogen sources in the segmental influent contributed to the higher active activity of microorganisms and higher removal efficiency the analysis of microbial communities in activated sludge and filler samples by illumina high throughput sequencing showed that the abundance and diversity of microbial communities in the biofilm were more significant than the activated sludge and proteobacteria were the most abundant phylum in the community the presence of many denitrifying phylum such as firmicutes and nitrospira ensured the stability of the modified aao system at low temperature dokdonella denitratisoma rhodoferax and other genera ensured efficient phosphorus removal graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords activated sludge biofilm coupling process segmental influent contaminant removal low temperature sludge characteristics data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction seasonal temperature change and ice melt could decrease the influent temperature 1 the operating effect of wastewater treatment plants with biological treatment as the primary process was easily affected by temperature and research showed that low temperature mainly affects the metabolic rate of microorganisms which leads to the weakening of nitrification mainly in terms of the stability and efficiency of the nitrification process 2 nitrification was significantly inhibited when the temperature below 10 c while denitrification was inhibited considerably at 10 15 c 3 the low temperature resulted in the inhibition of microbial activity the reduction of nitrogen and phosphorus removal and the significant reduction of pollutant treatment efficiency temperature changes also bring changes to the structure of the activated sludge microbial community and its metabolic processes as a result the sewage treatment plants in cold regions may exist problems such as poor process operation unstable effluent quality and high energy consumption in order to solve the problems of sewage treatment in cold areas it has attracted the attention of many scholars from all over the world 4 ai etc showed that the succession of dominant genera in the microbial community structure was to some extent conducive to the functional stability of activated sludge under temperature changes in a specific temperature range which provided new insights into the effect of temperature changes on the activity of activated sludge 5 adopting segmental influent facilitate rational distribution of raw water contaminants control of pollutant load changes in the reactor optimization of the distribution of carbon sources in each segment of the system so that the carbon sources in raw wastewater could be fully used for denitrification and further improvement of tn removal efficiency in the wastewater biological treatment process 6 7 the system provides suitable substrate concentration for efficient nitrogen and phosphorus removal ensures stable effluent and has specific shock load resistance the segmental water intake can coordinate the competition between nitrogen removal bacteria and phosphorus removal bacteria and has the characteristics of energy saving to achieve the purpose of simultaneous nitrogen and phosphorus removal by adding biofilm fillers to the activated sludge can strengthen the nitrogen removal effect and low temperature resistance of the system the drift sphere suspension filler can effectively increase the abundance and diversity of nitrogen removal related long sludge age microorganisms and promote system nitrogen removal this method increases the number of nitrifying bacteria without increasing the amount of sludge discharged from the system 8 in experiments exploring the operation of biofilm reactors at different temperatures and c n conditions ivar zekker et al found that the enrichment degree of anammox bacteria in the biofilm reaches 7 6 played a significant role in the removal of nitrogen in the reactor 9 11 biofilm fillers dosed at low temperature provides thermal insulation effect for the microorganisms enriched in the filler system still have strong nitrification performance when the temperature drops sharply 12 the application of filler was an effective method to improve the performance of low temperature denitrification among them eps as a cell secreted macromolecular substance heterotrophic bacteria such as denitrifying bacteria produce large amounts of eps and it can enhance the attachment of slow growing nitrifying bacteria to the biofilm packing it also has the function of protecting cells acting as an energy substance and reflecting the settling properties of sludge 13 14 oxygen is required to degradation organic matter and even for nitrification and survival of microorganisms monitoring the oxygen uptake rate by microorganisms can reflect the active biomass in activated sludge and biofilm from the side 15 during the biological oxidation of organic matter dehydrogenase is a critical enzyme in the process of microbial degradation of organic pollutants for energy the value of dehydrogenase activity is related to the ability of microorganisms to degrade the substrate mersi et al used dehydrogenase activity dha to represent the activity of microorganisms in the treatment system achieved the expected results 16 therefore specific oxygen uptake rate sour and dha can visually reflect the action of microorganisms between groups within the treatment system assist in determining the microbial activity at low temperature 17 to provide wastewater plants affected by seasonal temperature changes with better anti low temperature measures must understand the characteristics of the activated sludge biofilm itself and the structure of the bacterial flora is how to respond to the application of hardening measures 18 activated sludge and biofilm were aggregates of bacteria in a coupling activated sludge biofilm system few studies has combined bacterial flora structure microbial activity and pollutant removal patterns to analyzed the treatment process performance 19 in this experiment an activated sludge coupled with displaced spheres biofilm hybrid system was formed by the aao process with the addition of displaced spheres fillers which increased the biomass facilitated the enrichment of long lived microorganisms and suppressed the adverse effects low temperature at the same time the pollutant load in the reactor was controlled by segmental influent to provide sufficient substrate concentration for nitrogen and phosphorus removal which provides a possibility to achieve efficient and stable disposal of urban wastewater under low temperature in this study eps dha and sour were used to analyze the characteristics and activity of activated sludge and biofilm at low temperature in the segmental influent aao coupling process this study examined the efficiency of pollutant removal at low temperature variation of contaminant content in the reactor along the course nitrification and denitrification rates microbial flora structure to analyze the pollutant removal regularity and microbial flora characteristics of low temperature wastewater treated by

aao segmental influent biofilm filler coupling process was entered water into compartments a1 and o1 contaminant content within each compartment differ from those of conventional aao processes

biofilm coupling process during the 40 days operation of the aao segmental influent biofilm coupling process the removal of pollutants was shown in table 1 among them the maximum effluent of cod nh4 n tn tp were 45 15 mg cod l 1 6 67 mg n l 1 13 62 mg n l 1 0 48 mg p l 1 average removal rates were 88 62 91 01 76 67 and 96 60 average mass mlss pollutant removal were 88 6 mg cod g mlss d 1 1 8 6 mg nh4 n g mlss d 1 1 10 1 mg tn g mlss d 1 1 1 251 mg tp g mlss d 1 1 the weight of pollutant removal per unit volume in one day for the aao segmental influent biofilm coupling process could be obtained the pollutant removal weight of cod nh4 n tn tp were 518 44 g cod m3 d 1 48 6 g nh4 n m3 d 1 51 25 g tn m3 d 1 8 74 g tp m3 d 1 in summary the system had a greater treatment effect on pollutants according to the fluctuation range of the pollutant removal rates during operation it could be concluded that the operating state of the system was relatively stable 3 2 removal law of pollutants along the compartments of aao segmental influent biofilm coupling process 3 2 1 removal of cod in each compartment as detailed in fig 2a the cod concentration of the system influent concentration was 285 59 mg cod l 1 effluent cod concentration was 26 37 mg cod l 1 removal rate was above 90 cod removal per unit mass of mlss was 90 8 mg cod g mlss d 1 1 implies that the system had a good effect on removing organic matter in low temperature wastewater a1 received 2 3 of the total cod in the influent which provided adequate carbon source for the growth of activated sludge and biofilm the relative degradation rate of cod in a1 was as high as 86 24 a possible explanation for this might be that the activated sludge in the compartment and the sludge in the sedimentation tank flow back to a1 would rapidly adsorbed cod in a1 and the adsorption test shows that the anoxic sludge could absorbed a large amount of organic matter 30 the cod in the a2 compartment came from the inflow of a1 and the reflux of o2 and the cod in a2 was not consumed this discrepancy could be attributed to that the activated sludge in a1 which adsorbed a large amount of cod was released to a small extent in a2 and unlike the conventional aao process there was almost no consumption of carbon source in a2 in the aao segmental activated sludge biofilm coupling process in o1 1 3 of the influent cod was rapidly utilized by the activated sludge and biofilm to achieve effective cod removal 3 2 2 removal of nh4 n in each compartment as illustrated by fig 2b the system influent nh4 n concentration was 26 48 mg n l 1 average effluent and removal rate were 2 18 mg n l 1 and 91 28 nh4 n removal per unit mass of mlss was 8 6 mg nh4 n g mlss d 1 1 the relative removal rate of nh4 n in a2 was 101 29 this mainly because that the nh4 n adsorbed in a1 was released in large quantities in a2 resulting in a significant increase in nh4 n content the relative degradation rates of nh4 n in o1 and o2 were as high as 46 15 and 61 94 respectively the higher nh4 n removal efficiency of the system at low temperature was mainly due to the enrichment of long lived microorganisms on the filler s surface by applying displaced ball packing due to the activity of metabolic cells many organisms produced their specific eps allowed a wide variety of organisms to inhabit and grow in aggregates 31 the increase in the number of long lived microorganisms such as nitrifying bacteria compensates for the decrease in biological activity caused by the low temperature environment and ensures the high nitrification efficiency of the system 3 2 3 removal of tn in each compartment as shown in fig 2c the tn concentration in the system influent was 34 44 mg n l 1 the tn concentration and removal rate in the effluent were 8 81 mg l 1 and 81 10 and the tn removal per unit mass of mlss was 9 mg tn g mlss d 1 1 the relative removal rate of tn in a2 was 51 02 denitrification of conventional a2o occurs mainly in the anoxic section using organic matter in the effluent and a large amount of refluxed nitrification solution to denitrify in the anoxic area however at low temperature as shown in fig 2b and c there was no denitrification reaction in the a2 section of the coupling aao activated sludge biofilm process in the segmental influent which combined with the release of cod in a2 as described earlier indicates that the lack of carbon source in a2 was mainly responsible for the absence of denitrification receptors on the other hand the nitrification reaction primarily occurs in the aerobic zone of conventional aao still the snd mainly occurs in the o1 of the segmental influent aao activated sludge biofilm coupling system where the carbon source was sufficient and the content of ammonia nitrogen and nitrate were high and the denitrifying bacteria attached to the suspended packing could take full advantage of the high substrate concentration to react rapidly to generate snd at the beginning of the operation denitrifying bacteria were affected by low temperature and the number of denitrifying bacteria in the system was insufficient and the activity was quiet but with the extension of the operation time denitrifying bacteria gradually adapted to the environment and started to show denitrifying performance after reaching a certain number of accumulations 7 which ensured the high denitrification efficiency of the system the relative removal rate of tn in o1 was as high as 55 28 meanwhile a small amount of carbon source and sufficient nitrification solution in o2 would also lead to snd and further decrease effluent tn ensured stable tn removal efficiency in the stabilization stage 3 2 4 removal of tp in each compartment as shown in fig 2d the system influent tp concentration was 4 42 mg p l 1 the average effluent concentration was maintained at 0 05 mg p l 1 the removal rate reached 96 38 and the tp removal per unit mass of mlss was 1 59 mg tp g mlss d 1 1 this was attributed to the anaerobic phosphorus release reaction occurs when the phosphorus rich sludge was returned to a1 from the superficial reflux and under anaerobic conditions phosphorus accumulating organisms paos absorbed and store organic compounds through the degradation energy of intracellular polyphosphates 32 the cod content provided by the influent to a1 was 667 22 mg h 1 and the relative removal rate of cod in a1 was as high as 86 24 which could meet the carbon source required for the synthesis of poly Î² hydroxybutyrate phb by phosphorus polymerizing bacteria unlike the conventional aao process a2 was the leading site of phosphorus release from the system in conventional aao p release was concentrated in the anaerobic zone because of the compartment s difference in volume and temperature difference in volume and temperature the intense activity of phosphorus polymerizing bacteria the sufficient carbon source and the enough hydraulic residence time in the anaerobic zone compared with the conventional aao where the release of tp was mainly in the anaerobic area the coupling system at low temperature was not conducive to the growth of polyphosphoric bacteria and the activity of polyphosphoric bacteria was poor when a large amount of carbon source in a1 was converted to phb the stored phb could not be fully used in a1 due to the short hydraulic residence time the tp was not ultimately released in the a1 compartment so the excess phb continued to react in a2 and the relative removal rate of tp in a2 reached 183 17 the close removal rate of tp in o1 was as high as 88 00 which was the leading site of phosphorus absorption in the system the reason for the analysis was the oxidation and metabolism of the large amount of carbon source in o1 by the polyphosphoric bacteria and the excessive uptake of po4 3 by their storage of phb 32 33 which results in a large amount of removal subsequently the tp was further absorbed by the stored phb in o2 to reduce the effluent tp concentration and the system achieved an excellent removal rate comparison of removal mechanism with traditional aao process standard aao anaerobic zone releases a large amount of phosphorus anoxic zone mainly undergoes denitrification reaction aerobic zone undergoes nitrification reaction and oxidizes organic matter to absorb phosphorus in the segmental aao activated sludge biofilm coupling process a large amount of n removal was concentrated in o1 and snd occurs mainly on the added displaced spherical biofilm filler cod degradation was focused on a1 and o1 and the oxidative decomposition of carbon source in o1 provides energy for denitrification and phosphorus absorption due to the segmental water intake of the system the release of p at low temperature was mainly in a2 and the stored phb cannot be used entirely in a1 the release of p at low temperature was mainly in a2 and the stored phb could not be used completely in a1 so a large amount of tp was released from the stored phb in a2 and the anoxic environment in o1 the phosphorus polymerizing bacteria oxidized and metabolized a large amount of carbon source and their own stored phb which resulted in a large amount of tp removal the advantages of the segmental influent with displaced ball fillers in this study focus on the reasonable distribution of pollutant concentration in the raw water and the enrichment of functional microorganisms in different compartments to achieve a good removal effect of the whole system 3 3 analysis of sludge characteristics of aao segmental influent biofilm coupling process 3 3 1 concentration analysis of activated sludge and biofilm sludge between compartments in the process as evident from the fig 3 the activated sludge concentration in each compartment were 4500 54 4200 34 4100 28 4000 71 mg l 1 and the return sludge concentration was 6300 88 mg l 1 and the activated sludge concentration in each compartment decreased step by step the biofilm concentrations on the sponge packing of each compartment were 1200 32 1000 28 1800 34 1600 47 mg l 1 and the biofilm concentrations on the bauer ring packing of each compartment were 40 3 30 9 90 7 70 9 mg l 1 the amount of biofilm in compartments a1 and a2 was smaller than that in compartments o1 and o2 since eps has multiple functions in microbial communities such as adhesion and structure 31 under anaerobic or anoxic conditions eps with viscous properties such as polysaccharides were less secreted and the bond between the cells and the filler was not tight and some of the biofilms were easy to flake off under the action of hydraulic shear secondly the blender slurry sheet and the displaced ball in a1 and a2 must have violent collisions and friction so that the biofilm on the filler was dislodged another possible explanation for this is that the segmental water intake provides more cod in the o1 compartment and a large amount of cod promotes the rapid proliferation of microorganisms on the filler and the efficient use of do under low temperature conditions makes the aeration smaller and the hydraulic shear effect weaker than the agitation of the electric mixer in addition the secretion of extracellular polymer in the aerobic conditions was beneficial to the enrichment of microorganisms on the aerobic compartment filler and the concentration of biofilm sludge in o1 accounts for more than 30 of the whole o1 sludge concentration according to fig 2c the denitrification of the system was mainly concentrated in o1 30 of the denitrifying bacteria on the biofilm sludge in o1 played a significant role in denitrification 3 3 2 analysis of activated sludge and biofilm eps content between compartments in the system as detailed in fig 4a the eps of activated sludge in each compartment varied greatly in polysaccharide content the highest polysaccharide content of 9 99 mg g mlvss 1 was found in a2 and the lowest range of 3 41 mg g mlvss 1 was found in a1 combined with fig 2a the highest polysaccharide content in a2 could be attributed to the lack of carbon source in a2 denitrification and the inflow of cod adsorbed by activated sludge in a1 to a2 which was gradually transformed into extracellular polymers mainly in the form of polysaccharides the polysaccharide content in the loose layer of each compartment tends to be 0 which was much smaller than the polysaccharide content in the compact layer a1 and o1 polysaccharide contents were smaller than a2 and o2 respectively and combined with fig 2a inferring that it was related to the amount of cod entering the compartment the cod contents into compartments a1 and o1 were 667 22 mg h 1 and 624 62 mg h 1 respectively while the cod contents into a2 and o2 were 289 62 mg h 1 and 300 51 mg h 1 it showed that the eps contents increased as the load decreased another possible explanation for this is that combined with fig 2d we could see that the activity of phosphorus polymerizing bacteria in o1 was higher than the o2 and it can be assumed that most of the cod entering o1 were rapidly converted into phb the energy storage material in activated sludge phosphorus polymerizing bacteria 34 there was no sufficient carbon source for intracellular synthesis of eps so eps was lower in o1 than in o2 the protein content of activated sludge eps did not differ significantly between compartments and the distribution of influent flow did not significantly affect the protein content fig 4b was the eps distribution in the biofilm o1 polysaccharide and protein were 22 32 and 35 45 higher than those in the o2 cell which differed from the anaerobic condition under the aerobic condition the cells on the biofilm had higher metabolic capacity than the anaerobic and anoxic conditions the cod adsorbed by the aerobic biofilm cannot be completely degraded by the cells in a short time and the excess carbon source will be converted into eps so the eps content of the biofilm in o1 was higher 3 4 analysis of microbial activity of activated sludge and biofilm in aao segmental influent biofilm coupling process 3 4 1 activity analysis of nitrifying bacteria in o1 and o2 compartments in the system as evident from the fig 5 nh4 n concentration decreased gradually with time and the nh4 n in o2 dropped faster when nh4 n in both compartments was around 1 2 mg l 1 the inflection point of nh4 n change curve appeared and the time inflection point in o1 lagged behind o2 compartment by 1 5 h when the inflection point of the nh4 n change curve occurred do appear to rise rapidly because the nh4 n in the mix was degraded and the rate of oxygen consumption by microorganisms in the system was significantly reduced indicating that the nitrification reaction was finished at this time the correlation r2 values of nh4 n degradation curves were all higher than 0 99 and it could be concluded that nh4 n concentration has an excellent linear relationship with time table 2 combined with fig 5 shows that o1 fig 5a was 35 04 lower than the o2 fig 5b nitrification rate the reason for analysis was that 1 3 of cod in the feed water enters o1 aerobic heterotrophic bacteria competed with aerobic nitrifying bacteria for do and the function of aerobic nitrifying bacteria was limited when do not sufficient 35 therefore the nitrification rate of o1 was lower than that of o2 and the inflection point of nh4 n concentration and do was later than that of o2 at the same time the nitrification solution in o2 would flow to a2 and the loss of nitrifying bacteria would stimulate the nitrifying bacteria in o2 to have higher activity and growth rate and the concentration of microbial population with nitrification function was more elevated than o1 and the increase of nitrifying bacteria concentration was directly expressed in the rise of nitrification rate 3 4 2 activity analysis of denitrifying bacteria in a1 and a2 compartments in the system as illustrated by fig 6 the correlation r2 values of denitrification rate curves were all over 95 and the correlation was significant the denitrification rate curves of a1 and a2 were divided into three stages a b c referring to table 3 the anoxic compartment of the coupling system had the highest denitrification rate in the stage a and the no3 n degradation rate was the fastest but the reaction time was short the reaction time was 20 30 min mainly because the no3 n concentration in the feed water was high and the no3 n was attached to the surface of the microorganism in large quantity and quickly 36 soluble and colloidal organic matter pre sorbed on the sludge could be used for denitrification 17 the denitrification time was longer and the rate was lower in the stage b when the microorganisms used the adsorbed no3 n for denitrification and the microorganisms used the non degradable organic matter in the water as the electron donor the rate of denitrification in stage c was the lowest because the nh4 n in the wastewater was degraded in the first two stages the concentration of remaining no 3 n in the water was quiet and the biodegradable organic carbon source was exhausted 37 microorganisms denitrify by oxidizing their metabolites as electron donors so the lowest denitrification rate the nitrification reaction was carried out in o2 and a large amount of nitrate nitrogen flowed into a2 to stimulate the activated sludge in a2 to adsorbed nitrate nitrogen rapidly the adsorption capacity of a2 was strong but the removal efficiency of nitrogen in a2 was relatively low because the cod content flowing into a2 was too low when a large amount of cod was adsorbed in a1 combined with fig 2a in the absence of a sufficient carbon source many denitrifying bacteria could not perform denitrification reactions in the absence of an electron acceptor resulting in a low reaction rate and thus low removal efficiency 3 4 3 activity analysis of activated sludge and biofilm dha dehydrogenase in each compartment of the system as detailed in fig 7 the dha of o1 activated sludge reached 41 16 Î¼g tf ml h 1 which was higher than that of compartments a1 a2 and o2 by 13 33 26 44 and 18 59 respectively the dha of both compartments were significantly higher than that of the next compartments this support the idea that the high cod and ammonia content in the compartments stimulated microbial activity and promoted the degradation of organic matter by microorganisms from fig 2 pollutants released in a2 due to the presence of snd phenomenon in the aerobic zone less no x n entered the anoxic tank another possible explanation for this is that the cod content entering a2 was 289 64 mg h 1 fig 2a under the condition that anaerobic denitrification electron donor and acceptor were not sufficient microbial denitrification and other functions were restricted and dha was lower than the different three compartments o1 compartment dha was larger than o2 because there were a large number of aerobic heterotrophic microorganisms in o1 dehydrogenase was involved in the oxidative energy transfer of microbial cells 38 from fig 2a b a large amount of cod in o1 provides carbon source for microorganisms life activities and the metabolism was vigorous secondly the nitrifying bacteria in o1 could obtain sufficient nh4 n for nitrification so the redox reaction was more vital than o2 and the dha was higher this process also enhances the intensity of the redox reaction in o1 as shown in fig 7 the activated sludge dha was significantly higher than the biofilm in each compartment the biofilm has to go through growth maturation aging and shedding and there were many aging cells in the biofilm 39 as the thickness of biofilm increases the oxygen transfer rate of the inner membrane decreases and becomes anaerobic and the lack of electron donors inhibits biofilm activity therefore the dha of biofilm in the filler was lower than that of activated sludge at the same time such an anaerobic anoxic environment was conducive to the denitrification of biofilm which confirms the snd of biofilm and activated sludge in o1 and ensures the denitrification efficiency of the system 3 4 4 analysis of activated sludge and biofilm sour in the o1 and o2 compartments of the system as shown in fig 8 the sour of activated sludge in two compartments of o1 and o2 were 16 04 and 11 50 mg o2 g mlvss h 1 respectively and the sour of activated sludge coupled with biofilm system were 17 43 and 13 03 mg o2 g mlvss h 1 respectively which were 8 66 and 13 34 higher than those of activated sludge in compartments combining with fig 2 it can be seen that the inflow of cod nh4 n and tp in o1 were 624 62 118 35 and 73 48 mg h 1 respectively which were much higher than the inflow of pollutants in o2 and the rate of do consumption of o1 pollutants in the degradation process was faster than that of o2 under the same conditions of ph do and temperature it can be inferred that the pollutant content of the influent water was the main reason for the difference in sour the pollutant content in o1 was higher than that in o2 which ensures the demand of carbon and nitrogen sources for the activated sludge and biofilm to a certain extent and makes the metabolism of microorganisms accelerate hence the rate was higher the o2 this also confirmed that the higher dha content in o1 was associated with higher microbial activity and microbial activity and therefore higher removal efficiency 3 5 analysis of microbial population structure in aao segmental influent biofilm coupling process 3 5 1 microbial diversity analysis of the system to further reveal the pathways of pollutant removal in the aao coupling process illumina high throughput sequencing was used to analyze the diversity of microbial communities in activated sludge and filler samples as shown in table 4 the total number of effective sequencing samples in the five groups were 344 140 the original sludge yn anaerobic sludge a1a2 s anaerobic biofilm filler a1a2 b aerobic sludge o1o2 s oxygen biofilm fillers o1o2 b the effective sequencing amounts of them were 75 944 65 420 63 668 75 235 63 873 respectively to analyzed the structural richness of microbial communities in activated sludge and biofilm filler the effective sequences were grouped otu at 97 similarity level and the Î± diversity index of each sample were counted from the number of otus the number of bacterial communities on the biofilm filler in each zone were larger than that of the activated sludge in that zone indicated that the biofilm filler could enrich more microorganisms there were 989 otus shared between aeb and anb 1005 otus shared between aes and ans 826 and 872 otus shared between aeb and aes anb and ans respectively the otus unique to the four groups of samples accounted for 2 72 2 97 3 77 and 8 62 of the total otus respectively the microbial communities in each part of the modified a2o system differed slightly and the oxygen enriched state and growth environment of each part were the main reasons for the minor differences chao1 index was an index that detects the number of otus in the community focus on assessing the total number of species the value larger the more species there were in the community the calculation results of chao1 index showed that the chao1 index in the sample from more to less was yn o1o2 b a1a2 b o1o2 s a1a2 this results were consistent with the species richness represented by the out quantity it could be considered that this was the order in which species abundances were detected shannon and simpson indices focus on analyzing the diversity of microbial communities but there were differences in the standards for measuring diversity between them the lower the shannon index the lower the diversity of species in the community the higher the simpson index the lower the diversity of species abundance in the community the results of calculated by shannon index and simpson index showed that the microbial community in the biofilm in the system contains more species than the activated sludge but limited by the low mass transfer resistance of activated sludge the abundance values of species in the biofilm community were lower than those in activated sludge but the increase in the number of species in the microbial community could also account for the addition of biofilm fillers it had played a role in promoting the removal of system pollutants through the 40 days operation of the aao segmental influent biofilm coupling process shannon index and simpson index compared to original sludge the number and abundance of both biofilm and activated sludge species in the system increased it shows that the operation of the aao segmental influent biofilm coupling system optimizes the diversity of microbial communities in activated sludge 3 5 2 analysis of the distribution law of microbial community structure at the phylum and genus levels in the system the distribution of the top 20 bacterial phylum level in the samples of the original sludge and the compartments in the system was shown in fig 9a as clearly seen also by figure the bacterial phylum with the relative abundance value greater than 1 in the original sludge were proteobacteria 55 75 bacteroidetes 35 1 firmicutes 4 33 verrucomicrobia 1 in the four samples of a1a2 s a1a2 b o1o2 s o1o2 b the relative abundance values were all greater than 1 were proteobacteria abundance values were 29 4 34 4 29 6 39 7 chloroflexi 24 2 24 4 20 2 24 9 bacteroidetes 18 9 22 9 25 2 11 8 actinobacteria 6 6 4 5 8 0 2 6 and firmicutes 4 7 7 7 5 2 3 2 verrucobacterium 4 77 2 03 3 95 1 69 the function of microorganisms largely depends on the community structure of microorganisms compared with the original sludge the phylum whose abundance values decreased after systematic culture were proteobacteria and bacteroidetes proteobacteria was the phylum with the highest proportion of colonies it played a huge role in denitrification and phosphorus removal and degradation of various pollutants in sewage treatment 40 bacteroidetes was an important class of heterotrophic organisms that participate in the recycling of organic carbon and proteins 41 proteobacteria and bacteroidetes played a momentous role in the removal of organic matter in the system due to the different organic matter types of the original sludge and the influent in the system the abundance of microbial phylum were different between them the abundance of bacteroidetes in the activated sludge samples in the system were higher than that in the biofilm samples and the activated sludge flocs had a larger contact area with the organic matter in the sewage which was more conducive to the growth and reproduction of heterotrophic microorganisms chloroflexi firmicutes actinobacteria verrucomicrobia planctomycetes gemmatimonadetes acidobacteria were the phylum whose abundance value increased after systematic culture chloroflexi was a complex phylum commonly found in anaerobic sludge and thought to be able to participate in autotrophic denitrification processes 42 however the test results showed that the chloroflexi phylum was evenly distributed in activated sludge and biofilm between different compartments of the system some literatures pointed out that firmicutes microorganisms could grow and reproduce in anoxic environment and their life activities were closely related to denitrification activities 43 the abundance of firmicutes was higher in a1a2 b and a1a2 s samples which also confirmed the previous view most of the microorganisms in actinobacteria were heterotrophic microorganisms which could utilize various types of organic matter as energy substances some bacteria in the phylum planctomycetes were anammox bacteria has ability to remove n 44 gemmatimonadetes could participate in the denitrification process 45 acidobacteria has denitrification genes and corresponding denitrification ability 46 in this experiment planctomycetes gemmatimonadetes and acidobacteria were more present in the biofilm samples at the same time we also found that bacteroidetes and actinobacteria could be uniformly distributed in the activated sludge in the system according to the characteristics of microorganisms in the phylum bacteroidetes and actinobacteria analyzed the reasons a1 and o1 in the system entered the sewage at the same time while rationally distributing the pollutants in the influent water the system s ability to remove organic matter was improved it is worth noting that nitrospirae 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 3 was the dominant nitrifying bacteria at low temperature in low temperature environments it could adapt to sudden temperature drops 2 the nitrospirae phylum was not detected from the original sludge indicated that the occurrence of the nitrospirae phylum in the system was related to the low temperature environment in which the experiment was conducted the distribution of the top 20 bacterial genus level in the samples of the original sludge and the compartments in the system was shown in fig 9b compared with the original sludge the abundance and species of microorganisms at the genus level increased after the system culture compared activated sludge samples with biofilm samples it was found that the distribution of most genus in activated sludge samples was higher than that in biofilm samples this was also in line with the description of the shannon index in the diversity section above however it was also found that the distribution of some bacterial genera in the biofilm samples were higher than that in the activated sludge samples included candidatus accumulibacter 2 80 4 04 2 69 4 42 candidatus competibacter 0 94 1 37 1 20 1 67 dokdonella 2 41 2 49 1 65 4 80 dechloromonas 0 30 1 91 0 20 0 81 candidatus accumulibacter was the dominant phosphorus removal bacteria in the biological phosphorus removal system under different conditions no3 n no2 n o2 could be used as electron acceptors to absorbed phosphorus and it had the performance of denitrification and phosphorus removal 47 the genus candidatus competibacter belongs to the glycogen accumulating organisms gaos conversion of volatile fatty acids vfa to polyhydroxyalkanoates pha under anaerobic conditions then pha could be oxidized to co2 under aerobic conditions or converted to glycogen seviour et al showed that candidatus competibacter could secrete polysaccharides to form eps higher abundances were detected in the biofilm samples presumably candidatus competibacter could accelerated the growth of biofilms in the system 48 this is also in line with the previous description of the biofilm eps section both dokdonella and dechloromonas had denitrification functions and dechloromonas also has the functions of ammonia oxidation denitrification and phosphorus removal 49 51 the removal of p in different systems may be due to different phosphorus removing microorganisms acting together rather than one phosphorus removing microorganism 52 the bacterial genus candidatus accumulibacter and dechloromonas in biofilm samples were detected at high abundance in the system few studies have reported however this provides evidence for the biological phosphorus removal and denitrification phosphorus removal in the aao segmental influent biofilm coupling process under different do oxygen environment a1a2 s and o1o2 s had the same distribution pattern of dominant bacterial genera however there were differences in the distribution rules of the dominant genera of a1a2 b and o1o2 b by comparison it could be found that the abundance of bacteria in a1a2 b samples was significantly higher than that in o1o2 b samples tetrasphaera 2 63 0 88 cloacibacterium 1 04 0 23 flavobacterium 2 25 0 39 lactococcus 1 05 0 50 acinetobacter 2 02 0 69 dechloromonas 1 91 0 81 tetrasphaera lactococcus and acinetobacter were the functional bacteria for phosphorus removal tetrasphaera was the main paos which could directly use glucose and amino acids for anaerobic phosphorus release at the same time tetrasphaera also showed the function of denitrification 53 lactococcus was a facultative anaerobic bacteria that utilizes carbohydrates to ferment and produce acid in the environment which may be involved in the degradation of system cod and the energy storage process of phosphorus accumulating bacteria 54 acinetobacter genus has the function of denitrification and phosphorus removal 55 56 cloacibacterium flavobacterium dechloromonas were bacteria genera with denitrification function 57 desulfobacterium catecholicum group and bacteroidetes vadinha17 were only detected in a1a2 s and o1o2 s biofilm samples by consulting the literature it can be found that dechloromonas tetrasphaera flavobacterium dokdonella acinetobacter candidatus accumulibacter candidatus competibacter and other genus could widely exist in the activated sludge samples of municipal sewage treatment plants the detection results of the above mentioned functional bacteria for denitrification and phosphorus removal were analyzed could be further explained that by adding biofilm fillers to the system snd and phosphorus removal by denitrification were promoted in the aerobic compartment strengthens the system s ability to simultaneously remove nitrogen and phosphorus the activated sludge and biofilm in the o1 and o2 compartments were provided with organic matter by the segmental water influent technology which was more conducive to the growth of aerobic heterotrophic microorganisms 4 conclusion 1 the aao segmental influent biofilm coupling process removal mechanism was different from the traditional process pollutants are released in a2 and a large amount of n was removed in o1 the degradation of cod was concentrated in a1 and o1 the release of p at low temperature is mainly in a2 and then a large amount was removed in o1 and the remaining tp was removed in o2 2 the aao segmental influent biofilm coupling process denitrification was concentrated in o1 where denitrifying bacteria on the biofilm played a considerable role in denitrification the eps content of compartmentalized activated sludge was negatively correlated with the amount of incoming cod the high cod and ammonia content in the compartments stimulated the microbial activity in o1 which promoted the degradation of organic matter by microorganisms and improved the pollutant removal efficiency in o1 3 the abundance and diversity of microbial communities in biofilms were more significant greater than in activated sludge and factors such as oxygen partitioning and packing increase the variety of system organisms the presence of many denitrifying phylum such as acidobacteria firmicutes and nitrospira ensured that the modified aao system operated stably under low temperature tetrasphaera candidatus accumulibacter dechloromonas and other genus provided the high efficiency of phosphorus removal declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

12832,in this study a coupling anaerobic anoxic oxic aao activated sludge biofilm process with segmental influent was constructed to increase the concentration of functional microorganisms in the reactor and improve the efficiency of municipal wastewater treatment at low temperature and investigated the pollutant removal pattern and microbial characteristics at low temperature conventional pollutants and sludge characteristics indicator were tested at the segmental influent flow distribution ratio of a1 o1 2 1 the study showed that the removal rates of chemical oxygen demand cod ammonia nitrogen nh4 n total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp were 89 90 74 76 60 and 96 60 in contrast to the conventional aao process at low temperature cod degradation was concentrated in a1 and o1 simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd occurred in o1 to achieve effective n removal the phosphorus p significant removal in o1 the extracellular polymeric substances eps content of activated sludge in the compartment was negatively correlated with the incoming cod content and the distribution of carbon and nitrogen sources in the segmental influent contributed to the higher active activity of microorganisms and higher removal efficiency the analysis of microbial communities in activated sludge and filler samples by illumina high throughput sequencing showed that the abundance and diversity of microbial communities in the biofilm were more significant than the activated sludge and proteobacteria were the most abundant phylum in the community the presence of many denitrifying phylum such as firmicutes and nitrospira ensured the stability of the modified aao system at low temperature dokdonella denitratisoma rhodoferax and other genera ensured efficient phosphorus removal graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords activated sludge biofilm coupling process segmental influent contaminant removal low temperature sludge characteristics data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction seasonal temperature change and ice melt could decrease the influent temperature 1 the operating effect of wastewater treatment plants with biological treatment as the primary process was easily affected by temperature and research showed that low temperature mainly affects the metabolic rate of microorganisms which leads to the weakening of nitrification mainly in terms of the stability and efficiency of the nitrification process 2 nitrification was significantly inhibited when the temperature below 10 c while denitrification was inhibited considerably at 10 15 c 3 the low temperature resulted in the inhibition of microbial activity the reduction of nitrogen and phosphorus removal and the significant reduction of pollutant treatment efficiency temperature changes also bring changes to the structure of the activated sludge microbial community and its metabolic processes as a result the sewage treatment plants in cold regions may exist problems such as poor process operation unstable effluent quality and high energy consumption in order to solve the problems of sewage treatment in cold areas it has attracted the attention of many scholars from all over the world 4 ai etc showed that the succession of dominant genera in the microbial community structure was to some extent conducive to the functional stability of activated sludge under temperature changes in a specific temperature range which provided new insights into the effect of temperature changes on the activity of activated sludge 5 adopting segmental influent facilitate rational distribution of raw water contaminants control of pollutant load changes in the reactor optimization of the distribution of carbon sources in each segment of the system so that the carbon sources in raw wastewater could be fully used for denitrification and further improvement of tn removal efficiency in the wastewater biological treatment process 6 7 the system provides suitable substrate concentration for efficient nitrogen and phosphorus removal ensures stable effluent and has specific shock load resistance the segmental water intake can coordinate the competition between nitrogen removal bacteria and phosphorus removal bacteria and has the characteristics of energy saving to achieve the purpose of simultaneous nitrogen and phosphorus removal by adding biofilm fillers to the activated sludge can strengthen the nitrogen removal effect and low temperature resistance of the system the drift sphere suspension filler can effectively increase the abundance and diversity of nitrogen removal related long sludge age microorganisms and promote system nitrogen removal this method increases the number of nitrifying bacteria without increasing the amount of sludge discharged from the system 8 in experiments exploring the operation of biofilm reactors at different temperatures and c n conditions ivar zekker et al found that the enrichment degree of anammox bacteria in the biofilm reaches 7 6 played a significant role in the removal of nitrogen in the reactor 9 11 biofilm fillers dosed at low temperature provides thermal insulation effect for the microorganisms enriched in the filler system still have strong nitrification performance when the temperature drops sharply 12 the application of filler was an effective method to improve the performance of low temperature denitrification among them eps as a cell secreted macromolecular substance heterotrophic bacteria such as denitrifying bacteria produce large amounts of eps and it can enhance the attachment of slow growing nitrifying bacteria to the biofilm packing it also has the function of protecting cells acting as an energy substance and reflecting the settling properties of sludge 13 14 oxygen is required to degradation organic matter and even for nitrification and survival of microorganisms monitoring the oxygen uptake rate by microorganisms can reflect the active biomass in activated sludge and biofilm from the side 15 during the biological oxidation of organic matter dehydrogenase is a critical enzyme in the process of microbial degradation of organic pollutants for energy the value of dehydrogenase activity is related to the ability of microorganisms to degrade the substrate mersi et al used dehydrogenase activity dha to represent the activity of microorganisms in the treatment system achieved the expected results 16 therefore specific oxygen uptake rate sour and dha can visually reflect the action of microorganisms between groups within the treatment system assist in determining the microbial activity at low temperature 17 to provide wastewater plants affected by seasonal temperature changes with better anti low temperature measures must understand the characteristics of the activated sludge biofilm itself and the structure of the bacterial flora is how to respond to the application of hardening measures 18 activated sludge and biofilm were aggregates of bacteria in a coupling activated sludge biofilm system few studies has combined bacterial flora structure microbial activity and pollutant removal patterns to analyzed the treatment process performance 19 in this experiment an activated sludge coupled with displaced spheres biofilm hybrid system was formed by the aao process with the addition of displaced spheres fillers which increased the biomass facilitated the enrichment of long lived microorganisms and suppressed the adverse effects low temperature at the same time the pollutant load in the reactor was controlled by segmental influent to provide sufficient substrate concentration for nitrogen and phosphorus removal which provides a possibility to achieve efficient and stable disposal of urban wastewater under low temperature in this study eps dha and sour were used to analyze the characteristics and activity of activated sludge and biofilm at low temperature in the segmental influent aao coupling process this study examined the efficiency of pollutant removal at low temperature variation of contaminant content in the reactor along the course nitrification and denitrification rates microbial flora structure to analyze the pollutant removal regularity and microbial flora characteristics of low temperature wastewater treated by segmental influent aao coupling process 2 materials and methods 2 1 overview of the test setup as shown in fig 1 the main body of the test device was an aao reactor made of plexiglas panels with the

a peristaltic pump effluent flowed from the outlet at the top of the sedimentation tank into the effluent bucket the filling rate of the anoxic and aerobic zones was 17 43 and 13 04 respectively due to the difference in the volume of each compartment by adding the same amount of displaced ball packing the sponge and bauer ring packing were filled inside the displaced ball packing the bauer ring

were detected sour assay was to extract 1 l of activated sludge and biofilm mixture in a beaker in o1 and o2 compartments oxygenation was performed in the beaker with an aerated sand head for 2 min after the oxygenation was stopped and the do concentration was read every 30 s by a dissolved oxygen meter within 10 min saur snur and sour used the values obtained by the change of substrate concentration in unit time to draw curves the sour saur snur values could be obtained by dividing the slope value of the obtained curve by the corresponding mlvss where the nitrification rate was the overall rate of ammonia and nitrite denitrification rate was the overall rate of nitrite and nitrate specific method reference 28 29 5 late in the experiment original sludge yn anaerobic sludge a1a2 s anaerobic biofilm a1a2 b aerobic sludge o1o2 s and aerobic biofilm o1o2 b in the system were sampled respectively samples were stored in 80 c refrigerator for later detection the e z n atm mag bind soil dna kit omega was used to extract total genomic dna dna integrity was analyzed by the agarose gel method gel imaging system from upv usa afterward sequencing was performed on the machine the library needs to be quality checked on agilent bioanalyzer first using the agilent high sensitivity dna kit libraries were then quantified using the quant it picogreen dsdna assay kit on a promega quantifluor fluorescent quantification system gradient dilution followed by 2 300 bp double end sequencing using miseq sequencer 2 5 inlet and outlet water pollutant content calculation formula the aao segmental influent biofilm filler coupling process was entered water into compartments a1 and o1 contaminant content within each compartment differ from those of conventional aao processes

biofilm coupling process during the 40 days operation of the aao segmental influent biofilm coupling process the removal of pollutants was shown in table 1 among them the maximum effluent of cod nh4 n tn tp were 45 15 mg cod l 1 6 67 mg n l 1 13 62 mg n l 1 0 48 mg p l 1 average removal rates were 88 62 91 01 76 67 and 96 60 average mass mlss pollutant removal were 88 6 mg cod g mlss d 1 1 8 6 mg nh4 n g mlss d 1 1 10 1 mg tn g mlss d 1 1 1 251 mg tp g mlss d 1 1 the weight of pollutant removal per unit volume in one day for the aao segmental influent biofilm coupling process could be obtained the pollutant removal weight of cod nh4 n tn tp were 518 44 g cod m3 d 1 48 6 g nh4 n m3 d 1 51 25 g tn m3 d 1 8 74 g tp m3 d 1 in summary the system had a greater treatment effect on pollutants according to the fluctuation range of the pollutant removal rates during operation it could be concluded that the operating state of the system was relatively stable 3 2 removal law of pollutants along the compartments of aao segmental influent biofilm coupling process 3 2 1 removal of cod in each compartment as detailed in fig 2a the cod concentration of the system influent concentration was 285 59 mg cod l 1 effluent cod concentration was 26 37 mg cod l 1 removal rate was above 90 cod removal per unit mass of mlss was 90 8 mg cod g mlss d 1 1 implies that the system had a good effect on removing organic matter in low temperature wastewater a1 received 2 3 of the total cod in the influent which provided adequate carbon source for the growth of activated sludge and biofilm the relative degradation rate of cod in a1 was as high as 86 24 a possible explanation for this might be that the activated sludge in the compartment and the sludge in the sedimentation tank flow back to a1 would rapidly adsorbed cod in a1 and the adsorption test shows that the anoxic sludge could absorbed a large amount of organic matter 30 the cod in the a2 compartment came from the inflow of a1 and the reflux of o2 and the cod in a2 was not consumed this discrepancy could be attributed to that the activated sludge in a1 which adsorbed a large amount of cod was released to a small extent in a2 and unlike the conventional aao process there was almost no consumption of carbon source in a2 in the aao segmental activated sludge biofilm coupling process in o1 1 3 of the influent cod was rapidly utilized by the activated sludge and biofilm to achieve effective cod removal 3 2 2 removal of nh4 n in each compartment as illustrated by fig 2b the system influent nh4 n concentration was 26 48 mg n l 1 average effluent and removal rate were 2 18 mg n l 1 and 91 28 nh4 n removal per unit mass of mlss was 8 6 mg nh4 n g mlss d 1 1 the relative removal rate of nh4 n in a2 was 101 29 this mainly because that the nh4 n adsorbed in a1 was released in large quantities in a2 resulting in a significant increase in nh4 n content the relative degradation rates of nh4 n in o1 and o2 were as high as 46 15 and 61 94 respectively the higher nh4 n removal efficiency of the system at low temperature was mainly due to the enrichment of long lived microorganisms on the filler s surface by applying displaced ball packing due to the activity of metabolic cells many organisms produced their specific eps allowed a wide variety of organisms to inhabit and grow in aggregates 31 the increase in the number of long lived microorganisms such as nitrifying bacteria compensates for the decrease in biological activity caused by the low temperature environment and ensures the high nitrification efficiency of the system 3 2 3 removal of tn in each compartment as shown in fig 2c the tn concentration in the system influent was 34 44 mg n l 1 the tn concentration and removal rate in the effluent were 8 81 mg l 1 and 81 10 and the tn removal per unit mass of mlss was 9 mg tn g mlss d 1 1 the relative removal rate of tn in a2 was 51 02 denitrification of conventional a2o occurs mainly in the anoxic section using organic matter in the effluent and a large amount of refluxed nitrification solution to denitrify in the anoxic area however at low temperature as shown in fig 2b and c there was no denitrification reaction in the a2 section of the coupling aao activated sludge biofilm process in the segmental influent which combined with the release of cod in a2 as described earlier indicates that the lack of carbon source in a2 was mainly responsible for the absence of denitrification receptors on the other hand the nitrification reaction primarily occurs in the aerobic zone of conventional aao still the snd mainly occurs in the o1 of the segmental influent aao activated sludge biofilm coupling system where the carbon source was sufficient and the content of ammonia nitrogen and nitrate were high and the denitrifying bacteria attached to the suspended packing could take full advantage of the high substrate concentration to react rapidly to generate snd at the beginning of the operation denitrifying bacteria were affected by low temperature and the number of denitrifying bacteria in the system was insufficient and the activity was quiet but with the extension of the operation time denitrifying bacteria gradually adapted to the environment and started to show denitrifying performance after reaching a certain number of accumulations 7 which ensured the high denitrification efficiency of the system the relative removal rate of tn in o1 was as high as 55 28 meanwhile a small amount of carbon source and sufficient nitrification solution in o2 would also lead to snd and further decrease effluent tn ensured stable tn removal efficiency in the stabilization stage 3 2 4 removal of tp in each compartment as shown in fig 2d the system influent tp concentration was 4 42 mg p l 1 the average effluent concentration was maintained at 0 05 mg p l 1 the removal rate reached 96 38 and the tp removal per unit mass of mlss was 1 59 mg tp g mlss d 1 1 this was attributed to the anaerobic phosphorus release reaction occurs when the phosphorus rich sludge was returned to a1 from the superficial reflux and under anaerobic conditions phosphorus accumulating organisms paos absorbed and store organic compounds through the degradation energy of intracellular polyphosphates 32 the cod content provided by the influent to a1 was 667 22 mg h 1 and the relative removal rate of cod in a1 was as high as 86 24 which could meet the carbon source required for the synthesis of poly Î² hydroxybutyrate phb by phosphorus polymerizing bacteria unlike the conventional aao process a2 was the leading site of phosphorus release from the system in conventional aao p release was concentrated in the anaerobic zone because of the compartment s difference in volume and temperature difference in volume and temperature the intense activity of phosphorus polymerizing bacteria the sufficient carbon source and the enough hydraulic residence time in the anaerobic zone compared with the conventional aao where the release of tp was mainly in the anaerobic area the coupling system at low temperature was not conducive to the growth of polyphosphoric bacteria and the activity of polyphosphoric bacteria was poor when a large amount of carbon source in a1 was converted to phb the stored phb could not be fully used in a1 due to the short hydraulic residence time the tp was not ultimately released in the a1 compartment so the excess phb continued to react in a2 and the relative removal rate of tp in a2 reached 183 17 the close removal rate of tp in o1 was as high as 88 00 which was the leading site of phosphorus absorption in the system the reason for the analysis was the oxidation and metabolism of the large amount of carbon source in o1 by the polyphosphoric bacteria and the excessive uptake of po4 3 by their storage of phb 32 33 which results in a large amount of removal subsequently the tp was further absorbed by the stored phb in o2 to reduce the effluent tp concentration and the system achieved an excellent removal rate comparison of removal mechanism with traditional aao process standard aao anaerobic zone releases a large amount of phosphorus anoxic zone mainly undergoes denitrification reaction aerobic zone undergoes nitrification reaction and oxidizes organic matter to absorb phosphorus in the segmental aao activated sludge biofilm coupling process a large amount of n removal was concentrated in o1 and snd occurs mainly on the added displaced spherical biofilm filler cod degradation was focused on a1 and o1 and the oxidative decomposition of carbon source in o1 provides energy for denitrification and phosphorus absorption due to the segmental water intake of the system the release of p at low temperature was mainly in a2 and the stored phb cannot be used entirely in a1 the release of p at low temperature was mainly in a2 and the stored phb could not be used completely in a1 so a large amount of tp was released from the stored phb in a2 and the anoxic environment in o1 the phosphorus polymerizing bacteria oxidized and metabolized a large amount of carbon source and their own stored phb which resulted in a large amount of tp removal the advantages of the segmental influent with displaced ball fillers in this study focus on the reasonable distribution of pollutant concentration in the raw water and the enrichment of functional microorganisms in different compartments to achieve a good removal effect of the whole system 3 3 analysis of sludge characteristics of aao segmental influent biofilm coupling process 3 3 1 concentration analysis of activated sludge and biofilm sludge between compartments in the process as evident from the fig 3 the activated sludge concentration in each compartment were 4500 54 4200 34 4100 28 4000 71 mg l 1 and the return sludge concentration was 6300 88 mg l 1 and the activated sludge concentration in each compartment decreased step by step the biofilm concentrations on the sponge packing of each compartment were 1200 32 1000 28 1800 34 1600 47 mg l 1 and the biofilm concentrations on the bauer ring packing of each compartment were 40 3 30 9 90 7 70 9 mg l 1 the amount of biofilm in compartments a1 and a2 was smaller than that in compartments o1 and o2 since eps has multiple functions in microbial communities such as adhesion and structure 31 under anaerobic or anoxic conditions eps with viscous properties such as polysaccharides were less secreted and the bond between the cells and the filler was not tight and some of the biofilms were easy to flake off under the action of hydraulic shear secondly the blender slurry sheet and the displaced ball in a1 and a2 must have violent collisions and friction so that the biofilm on the filler was dislodged another possible explanation for this is that the segmental water intake provides more cod in the o1 compartment and a large amount of cod promotes the rapid proliferation of microorganisms on the filler and the efficient use of do under low temperature conditions makes the aeration smaller and the hydraulic shear effect weaker than the agitation of the electric mixer in addition the secretion of extracellular polymer in the aerobic conditions was beneficial to the enrichment of microorganisms on the aerobic compartment filler and the concentration of biofilm sludge in o1 accounts for more than 30 of the whole o1 sludge concentration according to fig 2c the denitrification of the system was mainly concentrated in o1 30 of the denitrifying bacteria on the biofilm sludge in o1 played a significant role in denitrification 3 3 2 analysis of activated sludge and biofilm eps content between compartments in the system as detailed in fig 4a the eps of activated sludge in each compartment varied greatly in polysaccharide content the highest polysaccharide content of 9 99 mg g mlvss 1 was found in a2 and the lowest range of 3 41 mg g mlvss 1 was found in a1 combined with fig 2a the highest polysaccharide content in a2 could be attributed to the lack of carbon source in a2 denitrification and the inflow of cod adsorbed by activated sludge in a1 to a2 which was gradually transformed into extracellular polymers mainly in the form of polysaccharides the polysaccharide content in the loose layer of each compartment tends to be 0 which was much smaller than the polysaccharide content in the compact layer a1 and o1 polysaccharide contents were smaller than a2 and o2 respectively and combined with fig 2a inferring that it was related to the amount of cod entering the compartment the cod contents into compartments a1 and o1 were 667 22 mg h 1 and 624 62 mg h 1 respectively while the cod contents into a2 and o2 were 289 62 mg h 1 and 300 51 mg h 1 it showed that the eps contents increased as the load decreased another possible explanation for this is that combined with fig 2d we could see that the activity of phosphorus polymerizing bacteria in o1 was higher than the o2 and it can be assumed that most of the cod entering o1 were rapidly converted into phb the energy storage material in activated sludge phosphorus polymerizing bacteria 34 there was no sufficient carbon source for intracellular synthesis of eps so eps was lower in o1 than in o2 the protein content of activated sludge eps did not differ significantly between compartments and the distribution of influent flow did not significantly affect the protein content fig 4b was the eps distribution in the biofilm o1 polysaccharide and protein were 22 32 and 35 45 higher than those in the o2 cell which differed from the anaerobic condition under the aerobic condition the cells on the biofilm had higher metabolic capacity than the anaerobic and anoxic conditions the cod adsorbed by the aerobic biofilm cannot be completely degraded by the cells in a short time and the excess carbon source will be converted into eps so the eps content of the biofilm in o1 was higher 3 4 analysis of microbial activity of activated sludge and biofilm in aao segmental influent biofilm coupling process 3 4 1 activity analysis of nitrifying bacteria in o1 and o2 compartments in the system as evident from the fig 5 nh4 n concentration decreased gradually with time and the nh4 n in o2 dropped faster when nh4 n in both compartments was around 1 2 mg l 1 the inflection point of nh4 n change curve appeared and the time inflection point in o1 lagged behind o2 compartment by 1 5 h when the inflection point of the nh4 n change curve occurred do appear to rise rapidly because the nh4 n in the mix was degraded and the rate of oxygen consumption by microorganisms in the system was significantly reduced indicating that the nitrification reaction was finished at this time the correlation r2 values of nh4 n degradation curves were all higher than 0 99 and it could be concluded that nh4 n concentration has an excellent linear relationship with time table 2 combined with fig 5 shows that o1 fig 5a was 35 04 lower than the o2 fig 5b nitrification rate the reason for analysis was that 1 3 of cod in the feed water enters o1 aerobic heterotrophic bacteria competed with aerobic nitrifying bacteria for do and the function of aerobic nitrifying bacteria was limited when do not sufficient 35 therefore the nitrification rate of o1 was lower than that of o2 and the inflection point of nh4 n concentration and do was later than that of o2 at the same time the nitrification solution in o2 would flow to a2 and the loss of nitrifying bacteria would stimulate the nitrifying bacteria in o2 to have higher activity and growth rate and the concentration of microbial population with nitrification function was more elevated than o1 and the increase of nitrifying bacteria concentration was directly expressed in the rise of nitrification rate 3 4 2 activity analysis of denitrifying bacteria in a1 and a2 compartments in the system as illustrated by fig 6 the correlation r2 values of denitrification rate curves were all over 95 and the correlation was significant the denitrification rate curves of a1 and a2 were divided into three stages a b c referring to table 3 the anoxic compartment of the coupling system had the highest denitrification rate in the stage a and the no3 n degradation rate was the fastest but the reaction time was short the reaction time was 20 30 min mainly because the no3 n concentration in the feed water was high and the no3 n was attached to the surface of the microorganism in large quantity and quickly 36 soluble and colloidal organic matter pre sorbed on the sludge could be used for denitrification 17 the denitrification time was longer and the rate was lower in the stage b when the microorganisms used the adsorbed no3 n for denitrification and the microorganisms used the non degradable organic matter in the water as the electron donor the rate of denitrification in stage c was the lowest because the nh4 n in the wastewater was degraded in the first two stages the concentration of remaining no 3 n in the water was quiet and the biodegradable organic carbon source was exhausted 37 microorganisms denitrify by oxidizing their metabolites as electron donors so the lowest denitrification rate the nitrification reaction was carried out in o2 and a large amount of nitrate nitrogen flowed into a2 to stimulate the activated sludge in a2 to adsorbed nitrate nitrogen rapidly the adsorption capacity of a2 was strong but the removal efficiency of nitrogen in a2 was relatively low because the cod content flowing into a2 was too low when a large amount of cod was adsorbed in a1 combined with fig 2a in the absence of a sufficient carbon source many denitrifying bacteria could not perform denitrification reactions in the absence of an electron acceptor resulting in a low reaction rate and thus low removal efficiency 3 4 3 activity analysis of activated sludge and biofilm dha dehydrogenase in each compartment of the system as detailed in fig 7 the dha of o1 activated sludge reached 41 16 Î¼g tf ml h 1 which was higher than that of compartments a1 a2 and o2 by 13 33 26 44 and 18 59 respectively the dha of both compartments were significantly higher than that of the next compartments this support the idea that the high cod and ammonia content in the compartments stimulated microbial activity and promoted the degradation of organic matter by microorganisms from fig 2 pollutants released in a2 due to the presence of snd phenomenon in the aerobic zone less no x n entered the anoxic tank another possible explanation for this is that the cod content entering a2 was 289 64 mg h 1 fig 2a under the condition that anaerobic denitrification electron donor and acceptor were not sufficient microbial denitrification and other functions were restricted and dha was lower than the different three compartments o1 compartment dha was larger than o2 because there were a large number of aerobic heterotrophic microorganisms in o1 dehydrogenase was involved in the oxidative energy transfer of microbial cells 38 from fig 2a b a large amount of cod in o1 provides carbon source for microorganisms life activities and the metabolism was vigorous secondly the nitrifying bacteria in o1 could obtain sufficient nh4 n for nitrification so the redox reaction was more vital than o2 and the dha was higher this process also enhances the intensity of the redox reaction in o1 as shown in fig 7 the activated sludge dha was significantly higher than the biofilm in each compartment the biofilm has to go through growth maturation aging and shedding and there were many aging cells in the biofilm 39 as the thickness of biofilm increases the oxygen transfer rate of the inner membrane decreases and becomes anaerobic and the lack of electron donors inhibits biofilm activity therefore the dha of biofilm in the filler was lower than that of activated sludge at the same time such an anaerobic anoxic environment was conducive to the denitrification of biofilm which confirms the snd of biofilm and activated sludge in o1 and ensures the denitrification efficiency of the system 3 4 4 analysis of activated sludge and biofilm sour in the o1 and o2 compartments of the system as shown in fig 8 the sour of activated sludge in two compartments of o1 and o2 were 16 04 and 11 50 mg o2 g mlvss h 1 respectively and the sour of activated sludge coupled with biofilm system were 17 43 and 13 03 mg o2 g mlvss h 1 respectively which were 8 66 and 13 34 higher than those of activated sludge in compartments combining with fig 2 it can be seen that the inflow of cod nh4 n and tp in o1 were 624 62 118 35 and 73 48 mg h 1 respectively which were much higher than the inflow of pollutants in o2 and the rate of do consumption of o1 pollutants in the degradation process was faster than that of o2 under the same conditions of ph do and temperature it can be inferred that the pollutant content of the influent water was the main reason for the difference in sour the pollutant content in o1 was higher than that in o2 which ensures the demand of carbon and nitrogen sources for the activated sludge and biofilm to a certain extent and makes the metabolism of microorganisms accelerate hence the rate was higher the o2 this also confirmed that the higher dha content in o1 was associated with higher microbial activity and microbial activity and therefore higher removal efficiency 3 5 analysis of microbial population structure in aao segmental influent biofilm coupling process 3 5 1 microbial diversity analysis of the system to further reveal the pathways of pollutant removal in the aao coupling process illumina high throughput sequencing was used to analyze the diversity of microbial communities in activated sludge and filler samples as shown in table 4 the total number of effective sequencing samples in the five groups were 344 140 the original sludge yn anaerobic sludge a1a2 s anaerobic biofilm filler a1a2 b aerobic sludge o1o2 s oxygen biofilm fillers o1o2 b the effective sequencing amounts of them were 75 944 65 420 63 668 75 235 63 873 respectively to analyzed the structural richness of microbial communities in activated sludge and biofilm filler the effective sequences were grouped otu at 97 similarity level and the Î± diversity index of each sample were counted from the number of otus the number of bacterial communities on the biofilm filler in each zone were larger than that of the activated sludge in that zone indicated that the biofilm filler could enrich more microorganisms there were 989 otus shared between aeb and anb 1005 otus shared between aes and ans 826 and 872 otus shared between aeb and aes anb and ans respectively the otus unique to the four groups of samples accounted for 2 72 2 97 3 77 and 8 62 of the total otus respectively the microbial communities in each part of the modified a2o system differed slightly and the oxygen enriched state and growth environment of each part were the main reasons for the minor differences chao1 index was an index that detects the number of otus in the community focus on assessing the total number of species the value larger the more species there were in the community the calculation results of chao1 index showed that the chao1 index in the sample from more to less was yn o1o2 b a1a2 b o1o2 s a1a2 this results were consistent with the species richness represented by the out quantity it could be considered that this was the order in which species abundances were detected shannon and simpson indices focus on analyzing the diversity of microbial communities but there were differences in the standards for measuring diversity between them the lower the shannon index the lower the diversity of species in the community the higher the simpson index the lower the diversity of species abundance in the community the results of calculated by shannon index and simpson index showed that the microbial community in the biofilm in the system contains more species than the activated sludge but limited by the low mass transfer resistance of activated sludge the abundance values of species in the biofilm community were lower than those in activated sludge but the increase in the number of species in the microbial community could also account for the addition of biofilm fillers it had played a role in promoting the removal of system pollutants through the 40 days operation of the aao segmental influent biofilm coupling process shannon index and simpson index compared to original sludge the number and abundance of both biofilm and activated sludge species in the system increased it shows that the operation of the aao segmental influent biofilm coupling system optimizes the diversity of microbial communities in activated sludge 3 5 2 analysis of the distribution law of microbial community structure at the phylum and genus levels in the system the distribution of the top 20 bacterial phylum level in the samples of the original sludge and the compartments in the system was shown in fig 9a as clearly seen also by figure the bacterial phylum with the relative abundance value greater than 1 in the original sludge were proteobacteria 55 75 bacteroidetes 35 1 firmicutes 4 33 verrucomicrobia 1 in the four samples of a1a2 s a1a2 b o1o2 s o1o2 b the relative abundance values were all greater than 1 were proteobacteria abundance values were 29 4 34 4 29 6 39 7 chloroflexi 24 2 24 4 20 2 24 9 bacteroidetes 18 9 22 9 25 2 11 8 actinobacteria 6 6 4 5 8 0 2 6 and firmicutes 4 7 7 7 5 2 3 2 verrucobacterium 4 77 2 03 3 95 1 69 the function of microorganisms largely depends on the community structure of microorganisms compared with the original sludge the phylum whose abundance values decreased after systematic culture were proteobacteria and bacteroidetes proteobacteria was the phylum with the highest proportion of colonies it played a huge role in denitrification and phosphorus removal and degradation of various pollutants in sewage treatment 40 bacteroidetes was an important class of heterotrophic organisms that participate in the recycling of organic carbon and proteins 41 proteobacteria and bacteroidetes played a momentous role in the removal of organic matter in the system due to the different organic matter types of the original sludge and the influent in the system the abundance of microbial phylum were different between them the abundance of bacteroidetes in the activated sludge samples in the system were higher than that in the biofilm samples and the activated sludge flocs had a larger contact area with the organic matter in the sewage which was more conducive to the growth and reproduction of heterotrophic microorganisms chloroflexi firmicutes actinobacteria verrucomicrobia planctomycetes gemmatimonadetes acidobacteria were the phylum whose abundance value increased after systematic culture chloroflexi was a complex phylum commonly found in anaerobic sludge and thought to be able to participate in autotrophic denitrification processes 42 however the test results showed that the chloroflexi phylum was evenly distributed in activated sludge and biofilm between different compartments of the system some literatures pointed out that firmicutes microorganisms could grow and reproduce in anoxic environment and their life activities were closely related to denitrification activities 43 the abundance of firmicutes was higher in a1a2 b and a1a2 s samples which also confirmed the previous view most of the microorganisms in actinobacteria were heterotrophic microorganisms which could utilize various types of organic matter as energy substances some bacteria in the phylum planctomycetes were anammox bacteria has ability to remove n 44 gemmatimonadetes could participate in the denitrification process 45 acidobacteria has denitrification genes and corresponding denitrification ability 46 in this experiment planctomycetes gemmatimonadetes and acidobacteria were more present in the biofilm samples at the same time we also found that bacteroidetes and actinobacteria could be uniformly distributed in the activated sludge in the system according to the characteristics of microorganisms in the phylum bacteroidetes and actinobacteria analyzed the reasons a1 and o1 in the system entered the sewage at the same time while rationally distributing the pollutants in the influent water the system s ability to remove organic matter was improved it is worth noting that nitrospirae 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 3 was the dominant nitrifying bacteria at low temperature in low temperature environments it could adapt to sudden temperature drops 2 the nitrospirae phylum was not detected from the original sludge indicated that the occurrence of the nitrospirae phylum in the system was related to the low temperature environment in which the experiment was conducted the distribution of the top 20 bacterial genus level in the samples of the original sludge and the compartments in the system was shown in fig 9b compared with the original sludge the abundance and species of microorganisms at the genus level increased after the system culture compared activated sludge samples with biofilm samples it was found that the distribution of most genus in activated sludge samples was higher than that in biofilm samples this was also in line with the description of the shannon index in the diversity section above however it was also found that the distribution of some bacterial genera in the biofilm samples were higher than that in the activated sludge samples included candidatus accumulibacter 2 80 4 04 2 69 4 42 candidatus competibacter 0 94 1 37 1 20 1 67 dokdonella 2 41 2 49 1 65 4 80 dechloromonas 0 30 1 91 0 20 0 81 candidatus accumulibacter was the dominant phosphorus removal bacteria in the biological phosphorus removal system under different conditions no3 n no2 n o2 could be used as electron acceptors to absorbed phosphorus and it had the performance of denitrification and phosphorus removal 47 the genus candidatus competibacter belongs to the glycogen accumulating organisms gaos conversion of volatile fatty acids vfa to polyhydroxyalkanoates pha under anaerobic conditions then pha could be oxidized to co2 under aerobic conditions or converted to glycogen seviour et al showed that candidatus competibacter could secrete polysaccharides to form eps higher abundances were detected in the biofilm samples presumably candidatus competibacter could accelerated the growth of biofilms in the system 48 this is also in line with the previous description of the biofilm eps section both dokdonella and dechloromonas had denitrification functions and dechloromonas also has the functions of ammonia oxidation denitrification and phosphorus removal 49 51 the removal of p in different systems may be due to different phosphorus removing microorganisms acting together rather than one phosphorus removing microorganism 52 the bacterial genus candidatus accumulibacter and dechloromonas in biofilm samples were detected at high abundance in the system few studies have reported however this provides evidence for the biological phosphorus removal and denitrification phosphorus removal in the aao segmental influent biofilm coupling process under different do oxygen environment a1a2 s and o1o2 s had the same distribution pattern of dominant bacterial genera however there were differences in the distribution rules of the dominant genera of a1a2 b and o1o2 b by comparison it could be found that the abundance of bacteria in a1a2 b samples was significantly higher than that in o1o2 b samples tetrasphaera 2 63 0 88 cloacibacterium 1 04 0 23 flavobacterium 2 25 0 39 lactococcus 1 05 0 50 acinetobacter 2 02 0 69 dechloromonas 1 91 0 81 tetrasphaera lactococcus and acinetobacter were the functional bacteria for phosphorus removal tetrasphaera was the main paos which could directly use glucose and amino acids for anaerobic phosphorus release at the same time tetrasphaera also showed the function of denitrification 53 lactococcus was a facultative anaerobic bacteria that utilizes carbohydrates to ferment and produce acid in the environment which may be involved in the degradation of system cod and the energy storage process of phosphorus accumulating bacteria 54 acinetobacter genus has the function of denitrification and phosphorus removal 55 56 cloacibacterium flavobacterium dechloromonas were bacteria genera with denitrification function 57 desulfobacterium catecholicum group and bacteroidetes vadinha17 were only detected in a1a2 s and o1o2 s biofilm samples by consulting the literature it can be found that dechloromonas tetrasphaera flavobacterium dokdonella acinetobacter candidatus accumulibacter candidatus competibacter and other genus could widely exist in the activated sludge samples of municipal sewage treatment plants the detection results of the above mentioned functional bacteria for denitrification and phosphorus removal were analyzed could be further explained that by adding biofilm fillers to the system snd and phosphorus removal by denitrification were promoted in the aerobic compartment strengthens the system s ability to simultaneously remove nitrogen and phosphorus the activated sludge and biofilm in the o1 and o2 compartments were provided with organic matter by the segmental water influent technology which was more conducive to the growth of aerobic heterotrophic microorganisms 4 conclusion 1 the aao segmental influent biofilm coupling process removal mechanism was different from the traditional process pollutants are released in a2 and a large amount of n was removed in o1 the degradation of cod was concentrated in a1 and o1 the release of p at low temperature is mainly in a2 and then a large amount was removed in o1 and the remaining tp was removed in o2 2 the aao segmental influent biofilm coupling process denitrification was concentrated in o1 where denitrifying bacteria on the biofilm played a considerable role in denitrification the eps content of compartmentalized activated sludge was negatively correlated with the amount of incoming cod the high cod and ammonia content in the compartments stimulated the microbial activity in o1 which promoted the degradation of organic matter by microorganisms and improved the pollutant removal efficiency in o1 3 the abundance and diversity of microbial communities in biofilms were more significant greater than in activated sludge and factors such as oxygen partitioning and packing increase the variety of system

heterogeneous the clark model was better suited than the thomas model for predicting the performance of the adsorbent in a flow through system the adsorbent showed high removal efficiencies and good selectivity for phosphate in all tests graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords recirculating aquaculture systems phosphorus adsorption kinetics nutrient recovery 1 introduction as the world s population grows the need for sustainable food sources increases as well aquaculture systems have grown in popularity in recent years due to their potential to provide a sustainable protein source 1 recirculating aquaculture systems ras mitigate many issues posed by traditional systems such as excessive water usage pollution and disturbance of natural ecosystems as they are operated in tanks on land this keeps the fish isolated from the surrounding environment and eliminates much of the fresh water needed to run the system a ras typically has a water exchange rate of 10 or less of the total system water volume per day 2 due to the low water exchange rate and high fish stocking densities ras can produce wastewater that is 10 to 100 times more concentrated than traditional aquaculture systems 3 therefore the portion of the water discharged should be treated to remove constituents that can cause harm to the surrounding environment in particular the phosphorus excreted by fish should be removed to prevent eutrophication in nearby water bodies this phosphorus may be harvested from the water to supplement the world s current supply which comes from mining and is mostly used for agricultural purposes 4 5 mining is a nonrenewable method of obtaining phosphorus which will eventually deplete the earth s available stores 6 as phosphorus is an important component of all living organisms it is imperative to find ways to recover and reuse phosphorus to make the p cycle more sustainable the recovery of phosphorus can not only benefit agriculture but also reduce waste emissions from ras at a potentially lower cost due to the market for the spent adsorbent phosphorus can be harvested from wastewater using several different methods the most commonly used are biological uptake chemical precipitation and adsorption methods biological methods often struggle to remove an adequate amount of phosphate due to microbial uptake limitations 7 chemical methods work well to remove phosphorus from water but some restrict actual recovery of the phosphorus due to the high costs and environmental impacts associated with the added chemicals 8 adsorption is an attractive solution for phosphorus removal due to its simplicity and potential for beneficial use of the spent adsorbent many studies have demonstrated that phosphorus can be cost effectively removed from domestic wastewater by adsorption 9 16 therefore adsorption methods have high potential to serve the aquaculture industry resulting in environmental as well as financial benefits for the businesses involved the company phospholutions has developed an adsorbent material rhizosorb which they pre load with phosphorus for use as a controlled release fertilizer the active ingredient is aluminum oxide variations of which have been used in water and wastewater treatment for many years there is an opportunity to load this material with waste phosphorus from ras where the effluent p concentration may be high thus the purpose of this study is to assess whether rhizosorb can be used as a phosphorus recovery method for ras wastewater this can help contribute to sustainability and reduce potential harm associated with other commercial controlled release fertilizers which are often coated in plastic polymers 17 additionally there are relatively few studies that investigate adsorbents for their potential for phosphorus recovery from ras 18 which have different constituents than domestic wastewater therefore this work is necessary to further develop the sustainability of ras water treatment atlantic salmon are one of the most commonly grown species in ras due to their low cost and nutritional benefits 19 these and other anadromous fish require different levels of salinity over their lifetimes as they start their life cycle in freshwater and transition to saltwater as they reach adulthood 20 differing levels of salinity may affect the adsorption process additionally ras wastewater will contain feed excreta and other waste constituents which may also affect the adsorption of phosphorus tests were performed to determine how phosphate adsorption was influenced by salinity as well as fish wastewater constituents 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials rhizosorb was obtained from phospholutions before use the adsorbent was sieved with a fisher scientific 125 Î¼m sieve to obtain a lower bound of particle size and remove fines all labware was acid washed in a 10 hcl bath and rinsed in a deionized di water bath before use sea salt from instant ocean was used to add salinity where necessary the composition of which is as follows 47 5 cl 26 3 na 6 6 so4 2 and 3 2 mg2 while the other 17 is composed of other ions and water 21 bicarbonate hco3 is also present at 0 49 of the total weight the 500 mg po4 l 1 stock solution of phosphate was prepared by dissolving kh2po4 fisher scientific in deionized water from which standards were prepared ras wastewater was obtained from the national cold water marine aquaculture center ncwmac located in franklin maine from three tanks of 0 7 and 33 g l 1 salinity all samples except the ras wastewater samples were made up with di water 2 2 methods samples of phosphate were prepared by adding stock solution of po4 to a flask and making up the total volume to 15 ml with deionized water or salt water to a specified concentration and salinity level phosphate concentrations of 5 10 and 20 mg l 1 were used for the kinetic tests while concentrations of 20 mg l 1 were used for the equilibrium tests masses of adsorbent from 5 mg to 20 mg were added to the tubes and the samples were placed on a tube rotator and vigorously mixed at 20 rpm for a specified amount of time for the kinetic tests samples were removed and tested at various times up to two weeks until an equilibrium concentration was observed the equilibrium samples were left on the tube roller for the observed equilibrium time determined during the kinetic tests to be approximately 14 days for the column tests tubing was attached to either end of a 5 ml column fitted with cotton above and below the desired mass of adsorbent 1 5 2 0 or 2 5 g the inlet tubing was placed in the test phosphate solution and pumped through the sorption column in an up flow mode using a masterflex 7518 60 peristaltic pump at rates of 0 4 1 0 or 1 5 ml min 1 the flow rates were chosen to have comparable contact times to other phosphate adsorption column experiments in the literature 22 24 the outlet tubing emptied into a beaker the columns were prepared by pumping 50 ml of deionized water or solution with appropriate salt concentration through the system prior to use to ensure that the adsorbent was properly wetted before beginning the breakthrough experiments with added phosphate all solutions were adjusted to the appropriate salinity level 0 10 and 20 g l 1 before testing these salinities were chosen because many ras attempt to raise salmon in brackish water rather than saline water due to the higher operating costs and additional challenges that come with fully saline ras 25 furthermore salmon have been shown to grow well in lower salinities such as 12 and 22 g l 1 26 in all tests the phosphate concentration was tested using the colorimetric total orthophosphate method epa method 365 3 with a spectrophotometer set to 880 nm additional kinetic tests were performed with real atlantic salmon wastewater from ncwmac from three tanks of 0 7 and 33 g l 1 salinity corresponding to different stages of growth for the atlantic salmon tests were also performed with di and added sea salt at each of these salinities to compare the effect of other constituents in the salmon wastewater each wastewater stock solution was tested for its initial phosphate concentration then both the di and the wastewater solutions were adjusted up to 10 mg po4 l 1 for testing 3 data analysis and modeling adsorption capacity is the amount of target compound that can be bound by the adsorbent material usually reported as mg of adsorbate per g of adsorbent the adsorption process is a series of four major steps bulk diffusion mixing of adsorbate throughout solution film diffusion movement of adsorbate through a boundary layer intraparticle diffusion movement of adsorbate through pores and interaction with surface sites adsorption 27 the first and last are generally not considered time dependent steps during the design of kinetic systems because they are fast processes compared to the second and third steps 28 therefore the rate controlling step is often either film diffusion intraparticle diffusion or a combination of the two the relative influences of each can be approximated by fitting the data to diffusion models whether the final step interaction between the adsorbent and adsorbate is due to physical adsorption or chemical adsorption depends on the structure of molecules of the adsorbent and sorbate 29 the dominating phenomenon can be investigated by fitting various models to the adsorption data the measure of the amount of adsorbate that has been removed from solution per amount of adsorbent q t is given below in eq 1 1 q t c 0 c t m s v where q t is the amount of adsorbed phosphate per gram of adsorbent at time t mg g 1 c 0 is the initial concentration of adsorbate in solution mg l 1 c t is the concentration of adsorbate in solution at time t mg l 1 m s is mass of adsorbent g and v is the volume of solution of the sample l the adsorption capacity q max is reached when all binding sites on the adsorbent are saturated with adsorbate the removal percentage for the batch kinetic and equilibrium tests can be quantified below eq 2 2 removal efficiency 100 c 0 c f c 0 where c 0 is the initial concentration of po4 3 mg l 1 and cf is the concentration of po4 3 in solution at the end of the test mg l 1 3 1 adsorption kinetic models the time required to reach equilibrium varies with different adsorbents and adsorbates as the adsorption process can be controlled by several different factors many models have been derived to explain kinetic adsorption behavior 30 but two were applied here the weber morris model and the elovich model 3 1 1 diffusion model the weber morris model eq 3 describes the diffusion process and is one of the most widely used models for investigating the rate controlling step 30 3 q t k wm t c where k wm mg g 1 min0 5 is the rate constant and c mg g 1 is a constant associated with the thickness of the boundary layer if the constant c is equal to zero meaning that a plot of t 0 5 versus qt is a straight line that passes through 0 0 intraparticle diffusion is the rate limiting step 31 if not adsorption is controlled by multiple processes and the plots will often show two distinct linear sections that represent film and intraparticle diffusion respectively 32 33 3 1 2 adsorption reaction model the elovich model is given in eq 4 this model was first developed to model the adsorption of gas onto solids through chemisorption though more recently has been applied to the adsorption of pollutants from aqueous solutions 31 4 dq dt Î± e Î² q t this model is an empirical model so it does not have distinct physical meanings though it was developed with the assumption that the surface of the adsorbent is heterogeneous therefore the elovich model can indicate that the adsorbent is highly heterogeneous meaning that the adsorbent possesses many different types of binding sites with different binding energies 34 the elovich model also indicates that chemisorption may be a dominating phenomenon 35 3 2 adsorption equilibrium models 3 2 1 langmuir the most common models used to fit phosphate adsorption data are the langmuir and freundlich isotherms the langmuir isotherm assumes that there is a 1 1 stoichiometry between the absorbate and the adsorbent binding sites meaning that adsorption is a monolayer process 36 the langmuir model allows for the maximum adsorption capacity to be obtained from the data the model followed by its linear form are given in eqs 5a and 5b 5a q t q max k l c e 1 k l c e 5b 1 q t 1 k l q max 1 c e 1 q max where q max is the adsorption capacity mg g 1 k l is the langmuir adsorption constant l mg and c e is the equilibrium concentration mg l 1 37 3 2 2 freundlich the freundlich isotherm is not restricted to a 1 1 stoichiometry between the absorbate and the adsorbent this model does not allow for the maximum adsorption capacity to be calculated from the data so this parameter is calculated experimentally by observing the kinetic adsorption data the model and linear form are given in eqs 6a and 6b 6a q t k f c e 1 n 6b log q t log k f 1 n log c e where k f is the freundlich adsorption constant mg g 1 l mg 1 1 n and 1 n is the unitless freundlich adsorption intensity parameter 38 the adsorption intensity parameter is an indicator of the heterogeneity of the surface of the adsorbent a value close to or above 1 means that the sorbent is more heterogeneous 39 3 3 breakthrough curve models most aquaculture wastewater treatment systems are operated as flow through systems therefore it is important to evaluate the performance of the adsorbent in a column system this was done by analyzing the breakthrough curve data or the percentage of phosphate removed from solution over time the thomas and clark models were fit to the data to determine the best model for predicting the behavior of the adsorbent in a flow through system 3 3 1 thomas the thomas model given in eq 7 is one of the most widely used models for predicting breakthrough curves and this model assumes that the experimental batch data obeys the langmuir isotherm theoretically a well suited thomas model fit could indicate that diffusion is not a rate limiting step 40 7 c t c 0 1 1 exp k th q e m s q k th c 0 t where k th is the kinetic constant ml min 1 mg 1 and q e is the adsorption capacity mg g 1 many papers analyze adsorption data using the thomas adams bohart and yoon nelson models often comparing the fit of each model to their data however these models are all mathematically equivalent so it is not meaningful to compare between the three 41 42 thus the thomas model is satisfactory for the breakthrough curve analysis 3 3 2 clark the clark model uses the mass transfer coefficient in combination with the freundlich isotherm to define a relation for the breakthrough curve in the following way 43 8 c t c 0 1 1 a e rt 1 n 1 where n is the freundlich constant unitless and a unitless and r d 1 are the clark model parameters that do not have distinct physical meaning a high r2 with the clark model indicates that adsorption is a multi site process as defined in the freundlich isotherm 4 results and discussion 4 1 adsorption kinetic results 4 1 1 kinetic results for initial di tests all kinetic parameters were found using linear or nonlinear regression analyses and the diffusion coefficients and elovich parameters can be found in table 1 the weber morris model showed a high value of the intercept c for all tests this indicates that intraparticle diffusion is not the only rate limiting step instead multiple steps control the process the relative contributions of film and intraparticle diffusion were visualized by segmenting the plots of t 0 5 versus q t into two sections the first representing film diffusion and the second representing intraparticle diffusion these are shown in fig 1 the r2 were very high for the film diffusion segments all 0 93 or above the film diffusion rate constant k wmf decreased with increasing salinity indicating that the transport of the adsorbate through the liquid film was faster at lower salinities this rate constant did not change with a concentration increase from 5 to 10 mg l 1 though it doubled with a concentration increase to 20 mg l 1 this may indicate that film diffusion is more affected by salinity at low po4 3 concentrations but more affected by po4 3 concentration than salinity when the po4 3 concentrations are high the very low slopes of the intraparticle diffusion segments in all tests indicate a slow rate of diffusion into the pores of the adsorbent regardless of salinity or concentration the elovich model also fit the data well for all tests and the nonlinear regressions are presented in fig 2 this may indicate that chemisorption is the dominating binding mechanism meaning that a chemical bond forms between the adsorbate and the adsorbent binding site the likely explanation for the decrease in po4 3 removal with salinity is that sulfate so4 2 bicarbonate hco3 and other negatively charged ions may compete with the negatively charged phosphate ions for adsorption sites sulfate has been shown to be more competitive with phosphate than other anions decreasing phosphate adsorption capacity 13 at 10 and 20 g l 1 salt the sulfate concentrations are two and three orders of magnitude larger than the phosphate concentrations at 660 and 1320 mg l 1 respectively therefore the adsorbent still shows great affinity for phosphate as the removal percentages only decreased from 83 to 57 with an increase from 0 to 20 g l 1 salt it has been shown that aluminum oxide often has a high affinity for phosphorus 44 45 which is supported by our results another parameter affected by bicarbonate addition is the ph this parameter was not controlled throughout the adsorption experiments as it would be unlikely to be adjusted in practice the ph was also measured at the end of each experiment and none of the samples had significant changes in ph over the course of the test the ph can affect phosphate competition with other ions by changing the speciation for example the dominant form of phosphate at neutral ph is h2po4 while hpo4 2 dominates at ph above 7 2 46 inorganic carbon in solution will be present in different forms at different ph the dominant forms are co2 at ph 6 3 hco3 at 6 3 ph 10 3 and co3 2 at ph 10 3 47 therefore at neutral ph where most ras are maintained 48 the inorganic carbon will be predominantly hco3 with some co2 the negatively charged hco3 may compete with phosphate for binding sites but the neutral co2 will not however as ph increases there will be more hco3 and co3 2 the latter of which is more competitive with phosphate due to its higher charge sulfate may compete with phosphate for binding sites at any of these ph levels this can help to explain the decreasing adsorption capacity in higher salt solutions another possible contributor to the decrease in adsorption capacity at high salt concentrations is that the binding sites on the adsorbent surface are affected by the higher ph caused by the increase in bicarbonate the phpzc point of zero charge is the ph at which the surface charge on the adsorbent is zero above the phpzc the surface charge will be negative and below it will be positive 49 the phpzc for aluminum oxide is approximately 9 1 49 as the phosphate ion is negatively charged it is reasonable that higher ph or less positive net surface charge will allow for less bonding between the rhizosorb and the phosphate ions 4 1 2 effect of salinity and concentration on removal table 2 shows the po4 3 removal percentages at the end of each kinetic test the test with the highest removal percentage was the 10 mg l 1 test with no salt added as salinity increased from 0 to 20 g l 1 the removal percentages decreased from 83 to 57 indicating a lower adsorption capacity at higher salinity and ph as po4 3 concentration increased from 5 mg l 1 to 20 mg l 1 the removal percentage decreased from 67 to 53 this indicates that at lower concentrations a higher percentage of the total po4 3 may be removed this is a common trend in adsorption 24 50 51 as the binding sites with higher affinity will be saturated first and only the binding sites with weaker affinity will be available to bind the remainder of the po4 3 an adsorbent dose of 0 33 g l 1 was used for the kinetic tests the removal percentages with this adsorbent dose and po4 3 concentration are comparable to other existing po4 3 adsorbents that performed tests with similar parameters a study by younes et al 52 on phosphate adsorption by glauconite showed an approximate 85 removal rate for a dose of 0 25 g l 1 and an initial concentration of 5 mg l 1 which is comparable to the results of the rhizosorb in freshwater another study by fetene and addis 53 on pumice showed a removal efficiency of 73 for a dose of 2 g l 1 and an initial concentration of 3 mg l 1 this is lower than the removal rate exhibited by rhizosorb in a test using a smaller amount of adsorbent 0 33 g l 1 and a higher phosphate concentration 5 mg l 1 i e less favorable adsorption parameters this indicates that the rhizosorb is comparable or better than some other adsorbents in terms of capacity however an important point to note is that the rhizosorb took a very long time to approach saturation around four days often in batch experiments equilibrium is reached within a few hours 13 35 54 55 therefore this adsorbent may function better in systems where contact time can be extended 4 1 3 effect of salmon wastewater on removal removal percentages were compared for salmon wastewater and di water to elucidate the effects of wastewater constituents unfortunately the bicarbonate concentrations were not available for the salmon wastewater though the ph was given and is highly dependent on bicarbonate concentration ncwmac does not buffer their ph and it generally stays between 6 5 and 7 5 these removal rates are presented in table 3 similar to the di tests the salmon wastewater tests exhibited a decrease in po4 3 removal at higher salinities however the wastewater tests help to indicate the relative influences of salt as the same ph in the wastewater samples may indicate a consistent bicarbonate concentration therefore the differences in removal between the two water types may be attributed to the differences in anion competition most likely sulfate at the same ph the removal rates decreased by 10 with a salinity increase from 0 to 20 g l 1 this is a smaller decrease in removal than the decrease exhibited by the di tests where the ph increased with salt 20 there were substantial differences in the two water types at each respective salinity first the removal efficiency was decreased in the salmon wastewater at 0 g l 1 as compared to the di water however the removal efficiency was higher in the salmon wastewater than the di at salinities of 7 and 33 g l 1 a possible explanation for these results is that the salmon wastewater contains organic matter that may have bonded to the adsorbent and contributed to polymer bridging along with the salt 56 which would increase adsorption capacity in the saltier salmon wastewater tests overall these results are promising for the use of this adsorbent for ras water as they show that the removal percentages may be higher in ras conditions furthermore the wastewater obtained from the ras facility for this study had approximately 0 5 mg po4 l 1 but was adjusted up to 10 mg l 1 for testing therefore the removal percentage may further be increased in true ras water due to the lower po4 3 concentrations as shown by the original di tests 4 2 adsorption equilibrium results the data obtained from the batch tests fit both the freundlich and the langmuir models though the freundlich isotherm was a slightly better fit overall parameters can be found in table 4 and the linear fits for each model can be found in fig 3 aluminum oxide often exhibits close r2 for both the freundlich and langmuir isotherms 57 58 so these results are not unusual adsorption capacity decreases as salinity and ph increase the better freundlich fit indicates that adsorption is a multilayer process as the salinities and ph increased the freundlich constant k f increased the intensity parameter 1 n decreased with increasing salinity and ph indicating that the heterogeneity of the adsorbent decreases with increasing salinity this can be explained by the increasing ph and ion competition as the ph gets closer to the phpzc the aluminum oxide will have a smaller positive surface charge additionally changes in speciation will result in more competition between phosphate and other ions therefore the number of available binding sites for po4 3 adsorption decreases with increasing salinity and ph neutral ph is ideal for most aquaculture species and system ph should be kept as close to neutral as possible to keep the percentage of toxic unionized ammonia nitrogen low 48 therefore the ph of the water treated with this adsorbent will most likely be fairly close to neutral at all times keeping the number of active sites high and optimizing the rhizosorb adsorption capabilities 4 3 breakthrough curves the results of the column tests are shown in fig 4 column parameters can be found in table 5 as shown in the kinetic and equilibrium experiments the adsorbent needs a long contact time for the most efficient removal much longer than some other adsorbents the time to column exhaustion i e the time at which all binding sites are occupied and c c0 approaches 1 decreased with higher concentrations of phosphate fig 4a lower masses of adsorbent fig 4b higher flow rates longer contact time fig 4c and higher salinity fig 4d the decrease in time to reach exhaustion with higher concentrations of po4 3 agrees with the trend in the kinetic tests where the removal percentage decreased as the concentration increased therefore this should be expected lowering the mass of adsorbent decreases the overall amount of available binding sites allowing for less total phosphate to be adsorbed additionally lowering the mass of adsorbent effectively decreased the contact time by decreasing the volume of the column through which the solution passed the kinetic tests showed the relative influences of film and intraparticle diffusion without sufficient contact time the po4 3 ions are unable to make their way through the liquid film layer and into the particle this increases the amount of po4 3 in the effluent water this is similar to the effect that the increase in flow rate exhibits on the column as the contact time is decreased there is less opportunity for film diffusion and binding finally the decrease in exhaustion time for columns with higher salinities is similar to the effect of salinity in the batch tests this may be due to ion competition as the salt is added or the influence of ph on the binding sites and the heterogeneity of the adsorbent the clark and thomas models were fit to the column experiment data using nonlinear regression analysis and these results are shown in table 6 the unitless clark parameter a increased with increasing mass of adsorbent and decreased with increasing phosphate concentration flow rate and salinity the parameter r decreased as the adsorbent mass was increased from 1 5 g to 2 0 g and stayed relatively constant when the mass of adsorbent was increased from 2 0 g to 2 5 g as the phosphate concentration flow rate and salinities increased from 0 to 30 mg l 1 0 4 to 1 5 ml min 1 and 0 to 20 g l 1 respectively r increased the good fit to the clark model indicates that adsorption is a multi layer process in agreement with the freundlich isotherm fit 5 conclusions this study revealed that rhizosorb has potential to serve the ras wastewater treatment process though efficiency will be affected by some process parameters such as salinity ph bicarbonate contact time and po4 3 concentration the segmented weber morris model showed that there is a clear influence of both film and intraparticle diffusion during the adsorption process the good fits of the elovich model and the freundlich isotherm indicate that binding may be caused by chemisorption though further work to investigate binding energies is required to make a conclusive statement in salty solutions there may be competition with other ions reduced binding sites due to the changing ph or a combination of the two however rhizosorb shows high selectivity for phosphorus in kinetic equilibrium and column tests additionally the po4 3 removal rates in true salmon ras wastewater showed that this adsorbent may function well in particular as part of ras wastewater treatment additional work may show desorption parameters of the rhizosorb and further characterize it for its use as a slow release fertilizer declaration of competing interest

water marine aquaculture center ncwmac located in franklin maine from three tanks of 0 7 and 33 g l 1 salinity all samples except the ras wastewater samples were made up with di water 2 2 methods samples of phosphate were prepared by adding stock solution of po4 to a flask and making up the total volume to 15 ml with deionized water or salt water to a specified concentration and salinity level phosphate concentrations of 5 10 and 20 mg l 1 were used for the kinetic tests while concentrations of 20 mg l 1 were used for the equilibrium tests masses of adsorbent from 5 mg to 20 mg were added to the tubes and the samples were placed on a tube rotator and vigorously mixed at 20 rpm for a specified amount of time for the kinetic tests samples were removed and tested at various times up to two weeks until an equilibrium concentration was observed the equilibrium samples were left on the tube roller for the observed equilibrium time determined during the kinetic tests to be approximately 14 days for the column tests tubing was attached to either end of a 5 ml column fitted with cotton above and below the desired mass of adsorbent 1 5 2 0 or 2 5 g the inlet tubing was placed in the test phosphate solution and pumped through the sorption column in an up flow mode using a masterflex 7518 60 peristaltic pump at rates of 0 4 1 0 or 1 5 ml min 1 the flow rates were chosen to have comparable contact times to other phosphate adsorption column experiments in the literature 22 24 the outlet tubing emptied into a beaker the columns were prepared by pumping 50 ml of deionized water or solution with appropriate salt concentration through the system prior to use to ensure that the adsorbent was properly wetted before beginning the breakthrough experiments with added phosphate all solutions were adjusted to the appropriate salinity level 0 10 and 20 g l 1 before testing these salinities were chosen because many ras attempt to raise salmon in brackish water rather than saline water due to the higher operating costs and additional challenges that come with fully saline ras 25 furthermore salmon have been shown to grow well in lower salinities such as 12 and 22 g l 1 26 in all tests the phosphate concentration was tested using the colorimetric total orthophosphate method epa method 365 3 with a spectrophotometer set to 880 nm additional kinetic tests were performed with real atlantic salmon wastewater from ncwmac from three tanks of 0 7 and 33 g l 1 salinity corresponding to different stages of growth for the atlantic salmon tests were also performed with di and added sea salt at each of these salinities to compare the effect of other constituents in the salmon wastewater each wastewater stock solution was tested for its initial phosphate concentration then both the di and the wastewater solutions were adjusted up to 10 mg po4 l 1 for testing 3 data analysis and modeling adsorption capacity is the amount of target compound that can be bound by the adsorbent material usually reported as mg of adsorbate per g of adsorbent the adsorption process is a series of four major steps bulk diffusion mixing of adsorbate throughout solution film diffusion movement of adsorbate through a boundary layer intraparticle diffusion movement of adsorbate through pores and interaction with surface sites adsorption 27 the first and last are generally not considered time dependent steps during the design of kinetic systems because they are fast processes compared to the second and third steps 28 therefore the rate controlling step is often either film diffusion intraparticle diffusion or a combination of the two the relative influences of each can be approximated by fitting the data to diffusion models whether the final step interaction between the adsorbent and adsorbate is due to physical adsorption or chemical adsorption depends on the structure of molecules of the adsorbent and sorbate 29 the dominating phenomenon can be investigated by fitting various models to the adsorption data the measure of the amount of adsorbate that has been removed from solution per amount of adsorbent q t is given below in eq 1 1 q t c 0 c t m s v where q t is the amount of adsorbed phosphate per gram of adsorbent at time t mg g 1 c 0 is the initial concentration of adsorbate in solution mg l 1 c t is the concentration of adsorbate in solution at time t mg l 1 m s is mass of adsorbent g and v is the volume of solution of the sample l the adsorption capacity q max is reached when all binding sites on the adsorbent are saturated with adsorbate the removal percentage for the batch kinetic and equilibrium tests can be quantified below eq 2 2 removal efficiency 100 c 0 c f c 0 where c 0 is the initial concentration of po4 3 mg l 1 and cf is the concentration of po4 3 in solution at the end of the test mg l 1 3 1 adsorption kinetic models the time required to reach equilibrium varies with different adsorbents and adsorbates as the adsorption process can be controlled by several different factors many models have been derived to explain kinetic adsorption behavior 30 but two were applied here the weber morris model and the elovich model 3 1 1 diffusion model the weber morris model eq 3 describes the diffusion process and is one of the most widely used models for investigating the rate controlling step 30 3 q t k wm t c where k wm mg g 1 min0 5 is the rate constant and c mg g 1 is a constant associated with the thickness of the boundary layer if the constant c is equal to zero meaning that a plot of t 0 5 versus qt is a straight line that passes through 0 0 intraparticle diffusion is the rate limiting step 31 if not adsorption is controlled by multiple processes and the plots will often show two distinct linear sections that represent film and intraparticle diffusion respectively 32 33 3 1 2 adsorption reaction model the elovich model is given in eq 4 this model was first developed to model the adsorption of gas onto solids through chemisorption though more recently has been applied to the adsorption of pollutants from aqueous solutions 31 4 dq dt Î± e Î² q t this model is an empirical model so it does not have distinct physical meanings though it was developed with the assumption that the surface of the adsorbent is heterogeneous therefore the elovich model can indicate that the adsorbent is highly heterogeneous meaning that the adsorbent possesses many different types of binding sites with different binding energies 34 the elovich model also indicates that chemisorption may be a dominating phenomenon 35 3 2 adsorption equilibrium models 3 2 1 langmuir the most common models used to fit phosphate adsorption data are the langmuir and freundlich isotherms the langmuir isotherm assumes that there is a 1 1 stoichiometry between the absorbate and the adsorbent binding sites meaning that adsorption is a monolayer process 36 the langmuir model allows for the maximum adsorption capacity to be obtained from the data the model followed by its linear form are given in eqs 5a and 5b 5a q t q max k l c e 1 k l c e 5b 1 q t 1 k l q max 1 c e 1 q max where q max is the adsorption capacity mg g 1 k l is the langmuir adsorption constant l mg and c e is the equilibrium concentration mg l 1 37 3 2 2 freundlich the freundlich isotherm is not restricted to a 1 1 stoichiometry between the absorbate and the adsorbent this model does not allow for the maximum adsorption capacity to be calculated from the data so this parameter is calculated experimentally by observing the kinetic adsorption data the model and linear form are given in eqs 6a and 6b 6a q t k f c e 1 n 6b log q t log k f 1 n log c e where k f is the freundlich adsorption constant mg g 1 l mg 1 1 n and 1 n is the unitless freundlich adsorption intensity parameter 38 the adsorption intensity parameter is an indicator of the heterogeneity of the surface of the adsorbent a value close to or above 1 means that the sorbent is more heterogeneous 39 3 3 breakthrough curve models most aquaculture wastewater treatment systems are operated as flow through systems therefore it is important to evaluate the performance of the adsorbent in a column system this was done by analyzing the breakthrough curve data or the percentage of phosphate removed from solution over time the thomas and clark models were fit to the data to determine the best model for predicting the behavior of the adsorbent in a flow through system 3 3 1 thomas the thomas model given in eq 7 is one of the most widely used models for predicting breakthrough curves and this model assumes that the experimental batch data obeys the langmuir isotherm theoretically a well suited thomas model fit could indicate that diffusion is not a rate limiting step 40 7 c t c 0 1 1 exp k th q e m s q k th c 0 t where k th is the kinetic constant ml min 1 mg 1 and q e is the adsorption capacity mg g 1 many papers analyze adsorption data using the thomas adams bohart and yoon nelson models often comparing the fit of each model to their data however these models are all mathematically equivalent so it is not meaningful to compare between the three 41 42 thus the thomas model is satisfactory for the breakthrough curve analysis 3 3 2 clark the clark model uses the mass transfer coefficient in combination with the freundlich isotherm to define a relation for the breakthrough curve in the following way 43 8 c t c 0 1 1 a e rt 1 n 1 where n is the freundlich constant unitless and a unitless and r d 1 are the clark model parameters that do not have distinct physical meaning a high r2 with the clark model indicates that adsorption is a multi site process as defined in the freundlich isotherm 4 results and discussion 4 1 adsorption kinetic results 4 1 1 kinetic results for initial di tests all kinetic parameters were found using linear or nonlinear regression analyses and the diffusion coefficients and elovich parameters can be found in table 1 the weber morris model showed a high value of the intercept c for all tests this indicates that intraparticle diffusion is not the only rate limiting step instead multiple steps control the process the relative contributions of film and intraparticle diffusion were visualized by segmenting the plots of t 0 5 versus q t into two sections the first representing film diffusion and the second representing intraparticle diffusion these are shown in fig 1 the r2 were very high for the film diffusion segments all 0 93 or above the film diffusion rate constant k wmf decreased with increasing salinity indicating that the transport of the adsorbate through the liquid film was faster at lower salinities this rate constant did not change with a concentration increase from 5 to 10 mg l 1 though it doubled with a concentration increase to 20 mg l 1 this may indicate that film diffusion is more affected by salinity at low po4 3 concentrations but more affected by po4 3 concentration than salinity when the po4 3 concentrations are high the very low slopes of the intraparticle diffusion segments in all tests indicate a slow rate of diffusion into the pores of the adsorbent regardless of salinity or concentration the elovich model also fit the data well for all tests and the nonlinear regressions are presented in fig 2 this may indicate that chemisorption is the dominating binding mechanism meaning that a chemical bond forms between the adsorbate and the adsorbent binding site the likely explanation for the decrease in po4 3 removal with salinity is that sulfate so4 2 bicarbonate hco3 and other negatively charged ions may compete with the negatively charged phosphate ions for adsorption sites sulfate has been shown to be more competitive with phosphate than other anions decreasing phosphate adsorption capacity 13 at 10 and 20 g l 1 salt the sulfate concentrations are two and three orders of magnitude larger than the phosphate concentrations at 660 and 1320 mg l 1 respectively therefore the adsorbent still shows great affinity for phosphate as the removal percentages only decreased from 83 to 57 with an increase from 0 to 20 g l 1 salt it has been shown that aluminum oxide often has a high affinity for phosphorus 44 45 which is supported by our results another parameter affected by bicarbonate addition is the ph this parameter was not controlled throughout the adsorption experiments as it would be unlikely to be adjusted in practice the ph was also measured at the end of each experiment and none of the samples had significant changes in ph over the course of the test the ph can affect phosphate competition with other ions by changing the speciation for example the dominant form of phosphate at neutral ph is h2po4 while hpo4 2 dominates at ph above 7 2 46 inorganic carbon in solution will be present in different forms at different ph the dominant forms are co2 at ph 6 3 hco3 at 6 3 ph 10 3 and co3 2 at ph 10 3 47 therefore at neutral ph where most ras are maintained 48 the inorganic carbon will be predominantly hco3 with some co2 the negatively charged hco3 may compete with phosphate for binding sites but the neutral co2 will not however as ph increases there will be more hco3 and co3 2 the latter of which is more competitive with phosphate due to its higher charge sulfate may compete with phosphate for binding sites at any of these ph levels this can help to explain the decreasing adsorption capacity in higher salt solutions another possible contributor to the decrease in adsorption capacity at high salt concentrations is that the binding sites on the adsorbent surface are affected by the higher ph caused by the increase in bicarbonate the phpzc point of zero charge is the ph at which the surface charge on the adsorbent is zero above the phpzc the surface charge will be negative and below it will be positive 49 the phpzc for aluminum oxide is approximately 9 1 49 as the phosphate ion is negatively charged it is reasonable that higher ph or less positive net surface charge will allow for less bonding between the rhizosorb and the phosphate ions 4 1 2 effect of salinity and concentration on removal table 2 shows the po4 3 removal percentages at the end of each kinetic test the test with the highest removal percentage was the 10 mg l 1 test with no salt added as salinity increased from 0 to 20 g l 1 the removal percentages decreased from 83 to 57 indicating a lower adsorption capacity at higher salinity and ph as po4 3 concentration increased from 5 mg l 1 to 20 mg l 1 the removal percentage decreased from 67 to 53 this indicates that at lower concentrations a higher percentage of the total po4 3 may be removed this is a common trend in adsorption 24 50 51 as the binding sites with higher affinity will be saturated first and only the binding sites with weaker affinity will be available to bind the remainder of the po4 3 an adsorbent dose of 0 33 g l 1 was used for the kinetic tests the removal percentages with this adsorbent dose and po4 3 concentration are comparable to other existing po4 3 adsorbents that performed tests with similar parameters a study by younes et al 52 on phosphate adsorption by glauconite showed an approximate 85 removal rate for a dose of 0 25 g l 1 and an initial concentration of 5 mg l 1 which is comparable to the results of the rhizosorb in freshwater another study by fetene and addis 53 on pumice showed a removal efficiency of 73 for a dose of 2 g l 1 and an initial concentration of 3 mg l 1 this is lower than the removal rate exhibited by rhizosorb in a test using a smaller amount of adsorbent 0 33 g l 1 and a higher phosphate concentration 5 mg l 1 i e less favorable adsorption parameters this indicates that the rhizosorb is comparable or better than some other adsorbents in terms of capacity however an important point to note is that the rhizosorb took a very long time to approach saturation around four days often in batch experiments equilibrium is reached within a few hours 13 35 54 55 therefore this adsorbent may function better in systems where contact time can be extended 4 1 3 effect of salmon wastewater on removal removal percentages were compared for salmon wastewater and di water to elucidate the effects of wastewater constituents unfortunately the bicarbonate concentrations were not available for the salmon wastewater though the ph was given and is highly dependent on bicarbonate concentration ncwmac does not buffer their ph and it generally stays between 6 5 and 7 5 these removal rates are presented in table 3 similar to the di tests the salmon wastewater tests exhibited a decrease in po4 3 removal at higher salinities however the wastewater tests help to indicate the relative influences of salt as the same ph in the wastewater samples may indicate a consistent bicarbonate concentration therefore the differences in removal between the two water types may be attributed to the differences in anion competition most likely sulfate at the same ph the removal rates decreased by 10 with a salinity increase from 0 to 20 g l 1 this is a smaller decrease in removal than the decrease exhibited by the di tests where the ph increased with salt 20 there were substantial differences in the two water types at each respective salinity first the removal efficiency was decreased in the salmon wastewater at 0 g l 1 as compared to the di water however the removal efficiency was higher in the salmon wastewater than the di at salinities of 7 and 33 g l 1 a possible explanation for these results is that the salmon wastewater contains organic matter that may have bonded to the adsorbent and contributed to polymer bridging along with the salt 56 which would increase adsorption capacity in the saltier salmon wastewater tests overall these results are promising for the use of this adsorbent for ras water as they show that the removal percentages may be higher in ras conditions furthermore the wastewater obtained from the ras facility for this study had approximately 0 5 mg po4 l 1 but was adjusted up to 10 mg l 1 for testing therefore the removal percentage may further be increased in true ras water due to the lower po4 3 concentrations as shown by the original di tests 4 2 adsorption equilibrium results the data obtained from the batch tests fit both the freundlich and the langmuir models though the freundlich isotherm was a slightly better fit overall parameters can be found in table 4 and the linear fits for each model can be found in fig 3 aluminum oxide often exhibits close r2 for both the freundlich and langmuir isotherms 57 58 so these results are not unusual adsorption capacity decreases as salinity and ph increase the better freundlich fit indicates that adsorption is a multilayer process as the salinities and ph increased the freundlich constant k f increased the intensity parameter 1 n decreased with increasing salinity and ph indicating that the heterogeneity of the adsorbent decreases with increasing salinity this can be explained by the increasing ph and ion competition as the ph gets closer to the phpzc the aluminum oxide will have a smaller positive surface charge additionally changes in speciation will result in more competition between phosphate and other ions therefore the number of available binding sites for po4 3 adsorption decreases with increasing salinity and ph neutral ph is ideal for most aquaculture species and system ph should be kept as close to neutral as possible to keep the percentage of toxic unionized ammonia nitrogen low 48 therefore the ph of the water treated with this adsorbent will most likely be fairly close to neutral at all times keeping the number of active sites high and optimizing the rhizosorb adsorption capabilities 4 3 breakthrough curves the results of the column tests are shown in fig 4 column parameters can be found in table 5 as shown in the kinetic and equilibrium experiments the adsorbent needs a long contact time for the most efficient removal much longer than some other adsorbents the time to column exhaustion i e the time at which all binding sites are occupied and c c0 approaches 1 decreased with higher concentrations of phosphate fig 4a lower masses of adsorbent fig 4b higher flow rates longer contact time fig 4c and higher salinity fig 4d the decrease in time to reach exhaustion with higher concentrations of po4 3 agrees with the trend in the kinetic tests where the removal percentage decreased as the concentration increased therefore this should be expected lowering the mass of adsorbent decreases the overall amount of available binding sites allowing for less total phosphate to be adsorbed additionally lowering the mass of adsorbent effectively decreased the contact time by decreasing the volume of the column through which the solution passed the kinetic tests showed the relative influences of film and intraparticle diffusion without sufficient contact time the po4 3 ions are unable to make their way through the liquid film layer and into the particle this increases the amount of po4 3 in the effluent water this is similar to the effect that the increase in flow rate exhibits on the column as the contact time is decreased there is less opportunity for film diffusion and binding finally the decrease in exhaustion time for columns with higher salinities is similar to the effect of salinity in the batch tests this may be due to ion competition as the salt is added or the influence of ph on the binding sites and the heterogeneity of the adsorbent the clark and thomas models were fit to the column experiment data using nonlinear regression analysis and these results are shown in table 6 the unitless clark parameter a increased with increasing mass of adsorbent and decreased with increasing phosphate concentration flow rate and salinity the parameter r decreased as the adsorbent mass was increased from 1 5 g to 2 0 g and stayed relatively constant when the mass of adsorbent was increased from 2 0 g to 2 5 g as the phosphate concentration flow rate and salinities increased from 0 to 30 mg l 1 0 4 to 1 5 ml min 1 and 0 to 20 g l 1 respectively r increased the good fit to the clark model indicates that adsorption is a multi layer process in agreement with the freundlich isotherm fit 5 conclusions this study revealed that rhizosorb has potential to serve the ras wastewater treatment process though efficiency will be affected by some process parameters such as salinity ph bicarbonate contact time and po4 3 concentration the segmented weber morris model showed that there is a clear influence of both film and intraparticle diffusion during the adsorption process the good fits of the elovich model and the freundlich isotherm indicate that binding may be caused by chemisorption though further work to investigate binding energies is required to make a conclusive statement in salty solutions there may be competition with other ions reduced binding sites due to the changing ph or a combination of the two however rhizosorb shows high selectivity for phosphorus in kinetic equilibrium and column tests additionally the po4 3 removal rates in true salmon ras wastewater showed that this adsorbent may function well in particular as part of ras wastewater treatment additional work may show desorption parameters of the rhizosorb and further characterize it for its use as a slow release fertilizer declaration of competing interest

membrane technology has continued to offer competent and sustainable solutions for the preservation and recovery of water resources in terms of the active treatment of challenging oily wastewater and associated emulsions membrane technology provides diversity towards meeting specific needs of recovery operations superior efficiency and convenient operationalization over other mechanical and chemical approaches such as flotation coagulation and centrifugation 1 2 significant efforts have been directed towards emulsified oily water as it is the hardest to eliminate this is because the water contains oil droplets that are minute in size 10 Î¼m and remain suspended in water due to surfactants 3 other types of oily wastewater such as floating oils and dispersed oils relatively larger than 10 Î¼m easily coalesce and form large droplets that can be easily removed 4 ultrafiltration uf membrane technology has proved to be successful in removing emulsified droplets due to its operational modus that is largely dependent on size exclusion however this also presents its greatest hurdle that is fouling has long been the focal motivation for numerous research activities seeking to alleviate it as it leads to deterioration in permeation and retention performance 1 5 polymer blending modification is the most standard approach applied for improving membrane antifouling performance the one pot and mostly one step technique is attractive for its simplicity generally all that is required is to mix the desired materials having specific properties polymer solvent and additives and the resulting membranes will exhibit the characteristics of the content materials 6 previously our group designed ultrafiltration uf mixed matrix membranes by blending polyethersulfone pes and sulfonated polysulfone spsf with incorporated small amounts of tio2 nps 7 findings from our work showed that the stable flat sheet membranes separated oil in water emulsions and maintained good permeation and performance tio2 nps aided in the modification of the porosity and improved the hydrophilicity and mechanical strength of the mmms however the uf mmms were found to be appropriate only for the separation of emulsions containing oil droplet sizes 500 nm and the antifouling properties were observed to be short lived rather than increase the content of tio2 content in the membranes which was found to expand the pore size and porosity of the membranes we sought to improve the surface properties of pes spsf tio2 membranes through coating the direct deposition of a coating layer on a membrane targets the enhancement of the membrane surface without interfering with the integrity of the bulk membrane this therefore provides flexibility for a wide range of possibilities on the types of organic materials 8 and inorganic materials 9 that could be utilized to design the layers findings show that the exposure of coated materials on the surface of the membranes can improve the performance as well as impart new features contrary to the blended materials approach where these desired features may be overpowered by the properties of the bulk polymers 10 combining both organic and inorganic materials to generate a hybrid functional layer is an efficient technique in surface coating the merits of this combination are that the organic component acts as a binder and pore size modifier while the inorganic component enhances hydrophilicity and imparts stabilization of the organic component tian et al 11 fabricated a composite functional layer from poly vinyl alcohol pva and carbon nanotubes cnts on a polyacrylonitrile pan substrate for the separation of surfactant stabilized oil in water emulsions the average pore size of cnts pan membrane was reduced to 250 nm from 900 nm of the pan membrane this improved the selectivity of the coated membrane to 93 removal of oil droplets compared to 50 of an oil in water emulsion containing droplet sizes 2 Î¼m furthermore the formation of the superhydrophilic hybrid coating from pva and cnts exhibited self cleaning properties after filtration of the emulsions elsewhere gao et al 12 generated hybrid films consisting of a double organic and an inorganic element from polydopamine pei and single walled carbon nanotubes for oil in water separation the pore sizes of the hybrid coating ranged between 5 and 14 nm which was effective in the separation of oil in water emulsions containing an average of 54 nm droplet size while maintaining nearly 100 flux recovery at different oil concentrations of oil content in the emulsions most recently yang et al 13 also established the benefits of combining organic and inorganic materials for oily wastewater treatment in their research two organic components carboxymethyl chitosan and tannic acid were combined with inorganic cu3 po4 2 on polyvinylidene fluoride via alternate quaternary soaking in the absence of the inorganic component cu3 po4 2 on the coating the generated membrane displayed poor permeability and antifouling performance while that containing cu3 po4 2 had up to 127 improvement in permeation at high oil removal rates 99 6 and excellent antifouling properties in these studies the combination of materials is similar i e organic and inorganic but the properties of the hybrid layers are tunable to achieve the desired selectivity and antifouling characteristics suited to the separation of varying oil in water separation owing to the synergistic effect mechanism of organic and inorganic components these flexible aspects of hybrid layers can be further explored based on the choice of materials other contributions to the synergistic interaction between organic and inorganic components cited by researchers are that inorganic elements in a hybrid layer prevent the rigid close stacking of normally long chained organic polymers while the resulting loosening of chain arrangement is advantageous for improving the permeation performance the physical integrity of the composite layer is compromised and therefore requires to be stabilized via crosslinking on a membrane surface to prevent erosion and degradation during application 14 for instance halakoo et al 15 utilized glutaraldehyde ga to crosslink the layers of pei with graphene oxide sheets while preparing pervaporation membranes elsewhere cao et al 16 employed trimesoylchloride tmc to crosslink pei and generate nanofiltration nf membranes for humic acid and dye removal liu et al 17 fabricated freestanding carbon nanotubes in pei solutions which were then crosslinked with tmc to increase rigidity and add more functional groups that contributed to increasing the effectiveness of the membrane for emulsion separation the objective of this study is to tailor a hydrophilic polyethyleneimine tio2 hybrid layer on pes spsf tio2 uf mmm to improve the antifouling and separation performance of oil in water emulsions containing nano sized oil droplets 500 nm among them pei as a versatile water soluble polymer is used as an organic coating during membrane fabrication its wide applicability stems from the fact that it is rich in amino groups that endow it with a strong positive charge 18 tio2 nps were chosen as the inorganic component in the coating because of their antifouling antibacterial chemical and thermal enhancing properties to begin with the crosslinking reaction between pei and ga was established to identify the optimum working concentrations afterward pei was then integrated with various concentrations of tio2 nps and after vacuum assisted deposition was then crosslinked with ga unlike in the use of tmc crosslinking with ga offers a greener reaction approach with aldimine condensation reactions between aldehyde and amine groups yielding water molecules while those with tmc yield hydrochloric acid that may require additional removal steps 18 the target is to utilize the interplay between tio2 nps pei and ga to generate a new model of hybrid coating with the potential to meet the current application needs the relationship of these three materials is interpreted as follows tio2 nps were stably bound to pei through hydrogen bonding with the nh2 groups then nh2 groups from pei undergo aldimine condensation with aldehyde groups from ga additionally oh groups from adsorbed water on the tio2 nps also reacted with the carbonyl center of ga further ensuring the stability of the coated layer on the membrane surface it is postulated that by regulating the concentrations of the organic and inorganic components of the hybrid layer its width and density can be tailored thereby to ideal width fit for optimal filtration performance the effect of tio2 nps loadings on the thickness surface wettability surface charge and mwco of the hybrid layer was investigated the filtration and antifouling efficiency of the generated composite membranes was analyzed using filtration

concentration of pei 0 025 wt volume and post treatment parameters to use this was followed by investigating the optimal crosslinking concentration for ga to utilize briefly 10 ml of 0 025 wt pei was deposited onto a 16 6 cm2 pes spsf tio2 substrate sample under 0 09 mpa vacuum pressure the coated membrane was then thoroughly rinsed with 100 ml of di water after rinsing 10 ml of ga at different concentrations was deposited and allowed to crosslink with pei at 50 c for 45 min following this the membrane was rinsed with di water to remove unreacted groups and dried at 50 c for 3 min as shown in scheme 1 the membranes were then stored in pure water for later use the compositions of the pei ga coating layer are listed in table s1 as mg0 mg0 1 chemical group morphology and performance characterization techniques were utilized to establish that the optimum crosslinking concentrations for pei and ga were pei 0 025 wt ga 0 05 wt i e mg0 05 the hybrid layer was constructed by initially sonicating varying concentrations of tio2 nps dispersion 0 01 0 1 wt in optimal aqueous pei solution for 1 h 10 ml of the resulting pei tio2 ga solution was deposited on the mmms substrate using vacuum filtration following 10 ml of optimum ga concentration 0 05 wt was used to crosslink the pei tio2 ga layers at 50 c for 45 min finally the generated pei tio2 ga pes spsf tio2 composite membranes were rinsed and dried as previously described a breakdown of pei tio2 ga and ga concentrations used to coat the membranes is described in table 2 from table s1 mg0 05 was renamed to m1 0 wt

software was used to determine the average size of the nps which was found to be 19 nm the water uptake technique was employed to examine the physical behavior of membranes in water thereby showing the effect of coating and crosslinking the membranes membrane samples with a diameter of 20 mm were dried at 60 c under vacuum for 12 h the membranes were weighed and then soaked in di water for 24 h

potential was characterized by surpass 3 anton paar austria while the pore sizes of the substrate and coated membranes were calculated via the mwco method using different molecular weights of peg solutions 100 mg l after establishing the corresponding mwco at 90 retention rates for each membrane the relationship between the corresponding peg molecular weight and pore size was correlated using eq 2 21 as follows 2 d 0 09 m w 0 44 where d is the size of the pore in nanometres nm and m w is the peg molecular weight in daltons thermal measurements of membrane samples of a specific area and weight were taken at a 10 c min heating rate under nitrogen gas using thermogravimetric analysis tga tg209f3 tarsus netzsch germany hydrophilic properties of the membranes were determined in two ways

filtration tests membrane filtration performance was carried out using a laboratory cross flow filtration construct as illustrated in scheme 2 the pump 0 10 bar pressure gauges flow meter and valves were supplied by shanghai jiaxing pumps co ltd china a recirculating water chiller model number dlsb 4 15 from zhengzhou keda machinery and instrument equipment co ltd china was used to maintain the feed at room temperature a custom made stainless steel membrane cell with an area of 7 07 cm2 diameter 3 cm was connected in cross flow mode between the feed tank and the permeate collection point as demonstrated in scheme 2 to collect data compaction was first conducted for 90 min at 0 3 mpa after stabilization the pressure was reduced to 0 25 mpa and the water permeance was recorded in l m2 h

different oil in water emulsion feeds were prepared by adding the mass ratio of the oils gasoline hexane pet ether and dichloromethane to sds surfactant 9 1 at 100 ppm aqueous solution mixing was conducted at 900 rpm for 12 h 22 emulsion droplet sizes were characterized using litesizer 500 anton paar austria particle analyzer based on weighted number frequency the assessment of the efficiency of the membranes to remove oil from the feed solution was determined based on the total organic carbon toc eq 4 4 r 1 t p t f 100 where r is the observed rejection of the membrane t p is the toc in the permeate and t f is the toc of the feed the oil concentration in the feed and permeate samples were determined using toc analyzer ndir method model shimadzu japan feed and permeate samples were diluted up to 1000 times before being fed into the analyzer antifouling assessment was conducted using an on off method for the system with the highest oil concentration a membrane was first used in the pure water filtration system and then transferred to the filtration set up where fouling occurred after each emulsion filtration phase the fouled membrane was cleaned with deionized water subsequently the pwp of the clean membranes was calculated using eq 3 and denoted as j w2 the entire process encompassed two cycles in five phases for a total of 300 min one cycle included a pure water filtration phase and an emulsion separation phase and a cleaning step two aspects were used to describe the antifouling properties the permeance decline ratio pdr and the permeance recovery rate

permeance at phase v 3 results and discussion 3 1 chemical properties of the surface coated membranes functional group analysis helps to understand the physicochemical properties of the surface coatings and confirms the success of the methods used to fabricate membranes fig 1 shows comparative ft ir spectral characteristics of the substrate m0 and the composite membranes bulk polymer groups of m0 are represented by ch so3 and so2 at 2856 cm 1 2944 cm 1 1082 cm 1 and 1103 cm 1 respectively 23 a small absorption bend at 1646 cm 1 is ascribed to ti oh bonds resulting from adsorbed water on tio2 nps it confirms the incorporation of tio2 nps in the matrix 7 it is evident from fig 1 that the absorption band at 2944 cm 1 relates to the stretching vibration of ch2 this is broadened after the addition of crosslinked pei with ga in m1 indicating the contribution of methyl groups from ga and pei the wide band from 3000 3600 cm 1 represents the overlap of oh and nh2 groups 24 primary amine groups are also represented by a stretching vibration at 1576 cm 1 25 after the crosslinking of pei in m1 the intensity of the wide band at 3000 3600 cm 1 increased owing to the nh2 groups from pei further the band at 3000 3600 cm 1 decreased with the increase of tio2 nps concentration m1 the reason is that amine groups interact with tio2 nps especially a short sharp absorption appeared at 1542 cm 1 indicating the presence of protonated n h groups after the addition of tio2 to pei which can be observed in m3 m6 26 this type of ionization of amine groups in pei by aqueous ti oh dispersion as described in previous studies 27 two peaks can be used to highlight the difference in m1 and m2 m6 1659 cm 1 which is attributed to c n groups resulting from the condensation reaction between ga and pei in m1 begins to diminish in size for m2 m6 at the same time a bending vibration at 1717 cm 1 representing c o groups from ga emerges and intensifies in m2 m6 it implies that the interactions between c o groups from ga with nh2 groups from pei reduced in number upon the integration of tio2 nps 28 a detailed discussion on the crosslinking mechanism is presented in section 3 2 essentially ft ir demonstrates that tio2 nps were successfully integrated and that the desired interactions enabling the formation of a hybrid surface layer occurred additional qualitative and quantitative evaluation of functional groups of the coated membranes was conducted using xps as presented in fig 2 overall spectra in fig 2 a shows the presence of c 1 s at 285 ev o 1 s at 532 ev and s 2p at 167 5 ev for all membranes further n 1 s at 398 8 ev observed is ascribed to the presence of pei in pei ga and pei tio2 ga hybrid layer 3 a general peak demonstrating ti 2p is observed at 457 3 ev for pei tio2 ga layer confirming the presence and immobilization of tio2 nps on the surface of mmms fig 2 a since no obvious ti peak was observed in the substrate s xps spectrum due to its low concentration within the bulk membrane matrix raman spectroscopy analysis was used to determine the presence of the nps in the uf mmm substrate m0 as shown in fig s2 a peak at 517 cm 1 characteristic of tio bonds appeared in pes spsf tio2 uf mmm m0 7 the deconvoluted n 1 s peaks of m1 and m3 fig 2 b and c were utilized to elaborate the functional groups of the composite membranes m1 and m3 and further confirm the formation of the surface coating on the mmms the xps data corroborate the results found in ft ir first in fig 2 b pei ga mmm m1 containing crosslinked nh2 groups are detected at 400 2 ev cn nh and bridging n atoms are also detected at 398 8 ev 29 then upon the integration of tio2 nps the amine groups underwent protonation and were detected at 401 1 ev as demonstrated in fig 2 c 30 tio2 2p peak in m3 was identified at 458 3 ev and 463 8 ev 31 fig 2 d moreover atomic quantities of the elements supporting the above deductions are listed in table 3 m3 has a lower amount of nitrogen because the amine groups first interact with tio2 through hydrogen bonding and then undergo aldol condensation with ga groups therefore there are fewer free amine groups in m3 additionally tio2 nps impart the hybrid coating with a high content of oxygen which is beneficial towards increasing the hydrophilicity of the composite membrane 3 2 formation mechanism and the influence of tio2 nps before incorporating tio2 nps to the surface coating the optimum crosslinking reaction between pei versus ga was established table s1 and fig s3 it is proposed from literature that the mechanism of crosslinking with ga with pei initiates with the aldol condensation of ga molecules which dehydrate forming Î± Î² unsaturated aldehyde groups of ga the amine groups from pei then add to the unsaturated groups by attacking the carbonyl centers and follow through to another condensation reaction aldimine condensation generating cn unsaturated bonds as illustrated in fig 3 18 29 assessment of functional groups from ft ir was utilized to elaborate and confirm the formation of the surface coating fig s3 a small bend at 1600 cm 1 is observed establishing the formation of dehydrated unsaturated cc bonds in ga fig s3 32 the formation of cn bonds is represented by a brief and sharp band at 1659 cm 1 nh2 groups from pei correlate with the band at 1576 cm 1 crosslinking pei with sufficient quantity of ga increases the intensity of the band at 1659 cm 1 while that at 1576 cm 1 decreases i e as the amine groups are consumed in the aldmine condensation process more unsaturated cn bonds are formed represented by m1 spectrum in fig s3 from this analogy it is inferred that a small ratio of nh2 c n absorbance peaks will be representative of a high crosslinking degree as listed in table s2 23 the ratio of reactants in m1 is 1 2 pei ga an insufficient or excess quantity of ga is characterized by the appearance of a bend at 1717 cm 1 representative of unreacted c o groups as displayed in fig s3 b furthermore to supplement the crosslinking degree analysis the rigidity of the pei ga mmms is further described using the water sorption capacity as presented in table s2 a rigid structure will have poor water uptake and vice versa for a loosely packed structure 15 ti oh groups arising from adsorbed water molecules on tio2 nps facilitated the interaction of the nps with both pei and ga as shown in fig 4 first the protonation of amines resulted in hydrogen bonding interactions with tio2 ga then reacted with free amine groups and with tio2 nps through aldimine condensation and nucleophilic addition respectively though the interactions between ga and pei are decreased owing to the presence of tio2 nps the additional hydrogen bonding interactions between the molecules enhance stability and cohesiveness 33 ft ir spectra in fig 5 illustrates the difference in the band shifts between m1 and m3 m3 spectrum shows a peak at 1542 cm 1 representing the protonated amines ti oh bonds are indicated at 1644 cm 1 and finally unreacted carbonyl centers at 1717 cm 1 26 according to table s2 water uptake rates of m3 pei tio2 0 025 ga mmm were much higher than m1 pei ga mmm indicating a loosely crosslinked structure conclusively tio2 was successfully integrated with pei and aided in the formation of a loosely crosslinked but stable byrid layer by further interacting with ga through hydrogen bonding 3 3 morphological analysis of the coated membranes surface sem micrographs of the membranes are presented in fig 6 a visual comparison of the surface porosity of m1 to that of m0 shows a reduced number of exposed pores visible moieties protruding from the surface appear in m1 after crosslinking pei with ga the crosslinked masses become difficult to see after the crosslinking pei tio2 ga to the surface in m2 m7 composite membranes with ga 30 as demonstrated in the formation mechanism tio2 nps act as a chain disruptor and the hybrid coating possesses pore like gaps which are beneficial for permeance 34 this trend is observed in all pei tio2 ga mmms as demonstrated in fig 6 c g notably the tio2 is immobilized in a splotch pattern in m2 which contained the least amount of tio2 nps it is inferred the amount of tio2 nps was insufficient to be evenly distributed throughout the network of pei at the particular concentrations this is proven by the even dispersion of tio2 nps in m3 and m4 composite membranes a high tio2 loading in the deposited pei tio2 ga coating solution leads to the discontinuous layering of nps as observed in fig 6 f g for m5 and m6 composite membranes in m5 and m6 the pore like gaps between the nps widen as agglomeration becomes severe which may increase the risk of leaching during operation in addition roughness values in fig s4 corroborate the observations and deductions made from sem images the roughness of the composite membranes decreased from ra 9 1 0 6 nm m0 to ra 5 2 0 3 nm of m1 after the formation of crosslinked moieties that covered the surface of the membrane the roughness decreases further in m2 ra 3 8 0 04 nm after the integration of tio2 nps which help in the formation of a cohesive layer in contrast m3 shows a growth in roughness ra 4 7 0 6 nm it is deduced that the dense crosslinked moieties of pei ga in m1 exist as dense masses distributed on the surface of the membranes thereby creating deep grooves as shown in sem and tem micrographs in fig 6 b causing the high roughness of the layer following the addition of numerous spherical tio2 nps in m1 generates a relatively continuous network through interacting with both ga and pei via hydrogen bonding interaction hence causing a decrease in the roughness at 0 025 wt tio2 nps concentration in m3 the distribution of the nps is more closely arranged and therefore the roughness begins to slowly increase excess amounts of tio2 nps which were most likely agglomerated at higher concentrations caused a spike in the roughness of the composite membranes m5 ra 8 8 0 1 nm and m6 ra 12 1 0 3 nm as evidenced in fig s4 f g 35 to further support imaging analysis edx elemental mapping analysis was conducted on the surfaces of the membranes as shown in fig s5 a general overlay combined with the mapping of three core elements is presented for m1 and m2 n serves as the guiding element illustrating the distribution of coated materials as well as changes brought about by the crosslinking reaction it can be seen in fig s5 that n is clustered in m1 confirming the crosslinked structures observed in sem against a backdrop of o ti in m3 is specifically observed to appear in the areas where there is n 36 overall the coatings were homogeneously distributed in all membranes besides cross sectional imaging analysis in fig 6 shows the evolution of the layers as the coating components changed due to the high irregularity of the images of the hybrid coatings from sem images exhibited in fig 6 thickness assessment was based on tem micrographs after ultrathin microtome slicing of the membranes after the nips fabrication process the asymmetric structure of pes spsf tio2 substrate mmms in fig 6 a was characterized by a thin dense skin layer at the top surface and sponge structured sublayer membrane the thin top surface skin dense layer of m0 was measured to be 1 1 0 1 Î¼m pei ga and pei tio2 ga hybrid coatings were then coated on top of the dense thin skin layer m1 fig 6 b displayed a thick and irregular coating 341 36 nm due to crosslinked pei ga groups hence corroborating top surface observations after the introduction of tio2 the hybrid coating on the composite membrane became thinner and appeared to be more cohesive m2 223 41 nm and more so in m3 238 41 nm as displayed in fig 6 c and d respectively the pei tio2 ga hybrid layers continue to grow to a maximum of 627 13 nm for m6 as the content of tio2 nps is increased in the hybrid coating fig 6 g referring to fig 4 tio2 plays a role in the interruption and arrangement of crosslinked chains in the layer network the nps bind with amine groups of pei breaking the compact buildup of moieties when reacted with ga furthermore the carbonyl centers of Î± Î² unsaturated glutaraldehyde can interact with tio2 nps through hydrogen bonding ensuring a stable hybrid layer the better the distribution of tio2 the more improved the interconnection and organization between the molecules resulting in a homogenously distributed thin layer for as seen in m2 m3 and m4 heaped layers of high tio2 loadings accounted for the increased layer thicknesses as exhibited in sem images m5 and m6 as shown in fig 6 and edx images in fig s6 the regulation of a coating thickness is desirable for membrane filtration performance as it must not compromise the selectivity of the resulting composite membrane 37 3 4 properties of the membranes 3 4 1 mwco and thermal properties fig 7 demonstrates the mwco of the substrate and modified membranes determined from the filtration of 2 6 10 20 40 100 and 300 kda peg solutions 100 mg l according to the mwco assessment the all the membranes are in the ultrafiltration range albeit at different degrees a high crosslinking degree in m1 caused the membrane to have a low mwco at 8 5 kda it implies that the membrane will have a high selectivity during filtration under membrane filtration classification m1 falls well within the tight ultrafiltration tuf category at an average pore size of 4 5 nm tuf membranes have been extensively used for the separation of dyes organic solutes and some salts at low pressures 4 in a word the mwco assessment of the composite membranes is in agreement with the morphology and formation mechanism analysis it is also found from fig 7 that as the concentration of tio2 nps increases in the hybrid layer the coated membranes show increasing mwco i e m2 15 kda 6 3 nm m3 27 kda 8 0 nm m4 35 kda 9 1 nm m5 38 kda 9 4 nm and m6 40 kda 9 6 nm the changes in mwco are accredited to the inter chain spaces which would improve mass transport as observed in the surface imaging results fig 6 according to our previous study the resultant pes sps tio2 uf mmms displayed poor separation performance for oil in water emulsions containing droplets 500 nm owing to the large pore size 7 herein a pore size of 10 nm for a hybrid coating should be optimal for the removal of nano sized oil droplets of 100 nm as reported in the literature 12 fig 8 shows tga curves of the uf mmm and composite membranes all the membranes show four decomposition phases which can be associated with the chemical content of the membranes and the chemical interactions occurring in the membranes in the first phase at 100 200 c all the composite membranes pei tio2 ga 0 0 1 wt coating layers show a higher mass loss and decomposition rate than the substrate m0 38 this initial phase is related to the loss of water and any residual solvent this is because these membranes coated by pei adsorb more surface water than the substrate clearly the effect gradually decreases as the temperature is elevated with increasing saturation of inorganic tio2 nps content in the composite membrane in the second phase at around 200 450 c the decomposition is attributed to the pyrolysis of more thermally stable groups such as so3 belonging to spsf in m0 19 additionally the composite membranes with a pei tio2 ga hybrid layer exhibit a slower rate of decomposition at this temperature region as a result of chemical crosslinks and hydrogen bond interactions with pei from this it is evident that the composite membranes display improved thermal stability in comparison with the uf mmm substrate 34 in the third phase from 480 to 600 c the major mass loss observed is associated with the decomposition of the polymer backbones beyond 600 c there is an obvious distinction between the composite membranes and the uf mmms in particular m6 shows a maximum resistance to thermal degradation at this stage this is ascribed to the high tio2 nps content that absorbs more heat and has high thermal resistance furthermore for the composite membranes a slight mass loss at around 700 c marks the degradation of oxygen stable groups remaining in the polymer backbone any substance residue after 800 c is inorganic residue 33 the weight of the residue correlates with the expected content of tio2 nps in the composite membranes in brief overall tga analysis proves that pei tio2 ga hybrid coating layer endowed the composite membranes with high thermal stability 3 4 2 surface charge and wettability properties of the membranes in general the surface modification method is suitable for generating tunable surface charges surface charge of the uf substrate and surface coated membranes is demonstrated in fig 9 the zeta potential of m0 displays a high negative charge density around 33 0 2 9 mv which originates from a certain amount of spsf with so3 groups in m0 interestingly the zeta potential of m1 exhibits a positive charge of around 1 3 0 4 mv this demonstrates the charge reversing ability of pei owing to its high nh2 content 30 it is noted that the isoelectric point of 0 025 wt pei was measured and found to be 10 94 before the vacuum assisted deposition was performed after crosslinking with 0 05 wt ga a near zero surface charge is obtained confirming the consumption of nh2 groups during the aldimine condensation reaction other research has found similar tendencies after chemically crosslinking pei with appropriate amounts of cross linker 39 40 it also can be seen from fig 9 that the zeta potential of the composite membranes is quickly altered and grows in electronegativity by the addition of tio2 nps in addition the zeta potential of the composite membranes gradually changed from 2 9 0 8 mv to 17 3 1 5 mv with the increase of tio2 nps content from 0 01 wt m2 to 0 1 wt m6 in the hybrid layer it is well known that the surface charge of a membrane determines the interaction of the membrane surface and foulant ultimately affecting its separation performance except size exclusion electro neutrality in a membrane is uniquely beneficial for the fractionation of charged solutes having different sizes because separation will be dependent on the size exclusion mechanism 40 however the majority of organic compounds in water such as humic acids have an overall negative charge the lack of charge on a membrane surface hampers its repelling ability which influences antifouling alternatively a negatively charged membrane is beneficial for repelling foulants having negative charge such as oil droplets distant from the membrane surface 5 41 additionally wca and uwoca tests using gasoline were used to demonstrate the wettability properties of the composite membranes in an air environment as shown in fig 10 distinctly the uf mmm substrate and composite membranes can be defined as hydrophilic since all the wcas are below 90 6 among of them m1 has the highest wca of 63 compared with the other membranes which derives from the minimal charge on the membrane surface from zeta potential analysis m1 with a very low surface charge indicates the lack of charged functional groups on the surface contrary to the surface charge of m0 and the pei tio2 ga composite membranes 40 in addition the tightly packed and dense pei ga network impede the penetration of water molecules whereas the more loosely packed chains of pei tio2 ga hybrid hydrophilic layer on the mmms readily allow water transport it has been well established that membrane surfaces with low wcas demonstrate increased resistance to oil adhesion in the presence of water uwoca predicts the interaction of oil droplets with the membranes and simulates the interaction during filtration and therefore antifouling characteristics a membrane with ideal uwoca properties usually displays high antifouling performance 41 42 as shown in fig 10 all the pei tio2 ga composite membranes possess very high underwater oleophobicity i e 160 such as m2 163 m3 167 m4 169 m5 166 and m6 164 in water hydroxy groups endowed water molecules adsorbed on tio2 nps contribute to the interaction with water molecules to form a protective hydration layer on the membrane surface thereby increasing resistance to oil adhesion as such for m0 some oil molecules were able to penetrate through the membrane because the surface lacked sufficient hydrophilic groups to form a robust oil repelling hydration layer 11 13 17 3 5 permeation and separation performance of the membranes typically the water permeance behavior of the membranes correlates well with the mwco profile of the membranes the substrate with largest pores m0 exhibits the highest pure water permeance pwp 162 9 lmh bar 1 and oil in water emulsion permeance 122 2 lmh bar 1 as shown in fig 11 in contrast m1 with the smallest pore size had the lowest pwp of 44 1 lmh bar 1 and oil in water emulsion feed permeance of 25 8 lmh bar 1 30 the significance of incorporating tio2 nps is observed by the filtration performance of the composite membranes for instance the pwp of the composite membranes improves by 17 to 52 9 lmh bar 1 for m2 with 0 01 wt tio2 nps loading and by 49 to 86 2 lmh bar 1 for m6 with 0 1 wt tio2 nps the two composite membranes with the higher tio2 loadings i e m5 and m6 also display loosely compacted hybrid coatings leading to a reduced resistance to permeability under pressure beyond a certain point excess loading is disadvantageous as it may result in leaching of the nps and subsequently part of the surface layer which would reduce the membrane performance over time as evidenced by the large error bar in the filtration of oil in water emulsion for m6 prior to determining the retention performance of the membranes for emulsion separation it was found that the average oil droplet size of gasoline oil in water emulsion was 115 1 9 nm as illustrated in fig s7 b as anticipated m1 composite membrane with a 4 8 nm pore size demonstrated the highest retention of the nano emulsion at 97 6 as shown in fig 11 b further the oil rejection of the composite membranes progressively decreased from 96 5 m2 to 95 3 m3 88 8 m4 84 3 m5 and 81 6 m6 evidently the increasing pore sizes of the pei tio2 ga composite membranes displayed classic trade off performance for an investigation into the wider applicability of the composite membranes m3 was evaluated for the rejection of other types of oil in water emulsions namely those containing hexane dcm and pe as illustrated in fig 12 a the measured uwoca values of these oils with the substrate m0 pei ga mmm m1 and pei tio2 0 025 ga mmms m3 are shown in fig 12 b it can be concluded that the hybrid membrane coating was effective for improving the retention of nanoemulsions since all the oil in water emulsions contained oil droplets in the range of 110 300 nm as displayed in fig s7 for instance the rejection of hexane emulsion by m0 m1 and m3 was 55 7 95 4 and 93 4 respectively this relatively low rejection is ascribed to the small droplet size 110 nm of hexane in water emulsion in comparison to pe which has three times larger oil droplet size 305 nm and showed much better retention by m0 65 9 m1 99 9 and m3 97 1 fig 12 a while using mmms for the separation of oil in water emulsions it is shown that larger oil droplets are prone to coalesce and are thus more easily rejected contemporary literature work listed in table 4 shows that m3 performs well in comparison with other membranes used for the separation of oil in water emulsions containing nanosized oil droplets it is notable from the separation performance in fig 12 a that dcm shows less retention for m0 50 1 and m3 91 0 despite the fact that the dcm oil in water emulsion has a larger oil droplet size of 255 nm fig s11 c this is because dcm contains polar groups unlike gasoline hexane and pe allowing partial dcm miscibility with water consequently while under water dcm droplets adsorb on the negatively charged membrane surface to a certain extent this tendency is demonstrated in the wetting analysis using uwoca of dcm with m0 74 and m3 135 in fig 12 b whereas m1 is 145 it has been demonstrated that an effective way to remedy the wettability of a membrane surface against polar and nonpolar oils is to endow the membrane with hydroxy groups thereby imparting underwater super oleophobicity 20 membrane fouling by oils during filtration has been identified to be different from other types of foulants which fit into conventional mechanisms classified by hermia 46 standard partial and complete pore blocking and cake formation although the eventual outcome of fouling by oil is cake formation oil droplet fouling has been described to be different from the aforementioned models as the oil emulsions deform coalesce or split into smaller droplets under pressure 5 41 interaction of oil droplets with the membrane surface and pores is predicated on the inherent properties of the membrane specifically morphology hydrophilicity and pore properties the membrane materials and fabrication technique hence come into play to tailor these properties experimental observations have consistently shown that increased membrane surface hydrophilicity enhances its antifouling properties towards oil emulsion feeds 6 9 47 scheme 3 summarizes the filtration performance mechanism of the composite membranes 3 6 antifouling performance of the membranes oil in water emulsion feeds prepared from gasoline and dcm were used to demonstrate the antifouling characteristics and robustness of the membranes over long operations as demonstrated in fig 13 a b which illustrate the permeance decline and revival patterns of the membranes during filtration cycling of the two feed types although m0 maintains the highest flux due to its large pores it also shows a steep decline in pwp it shows a less than ideal capacity to regenerate water permanence which decreases from 162 lmh bar 1 to 117 lmh bar 1 after two emulsion filtration phases and three pwp cycles the water permanence of m0 was much lower after conducting filtration with dcm 98 lmh bar 1 clearly the greater decline during the filtration of dcm is ascribed to its affinity towards the oil and also the feed has larger oil droplet sizes than gasoline that is to say the buildup of the droplets on the surface was accelerated although m1 previously demonstrated excellent retention fig 13 a b illustrate that it had very poor regenerative ability m1 exhibited the lowest performance in both of the antifouling assessment systems after 5 h of filtration the water permeance of m1 dropped to less than half its initial value 19 lmh bar 1 from 44 lmh bar 1 in both instances the main factors affecting the antifouling performance of m1 are the surface charge pore size and the density of the surface coating since m1 has the lowest surface charge and smallest pore sizes it is difficult to rid the oil droplets that are trapped in the grooves of the dense crosslinks moreover owing to the low surface charge there lacks a repellant force preventing the adherence of the oil droplets to the surface alternatively m3 comprises a more permeable hybrid coating bearing hydroxy groups that impede the adhesion of oil droplets hence allowing it to regenerate more easily after cleaning the pdr tot describes the rate at which foulants accumulate on the membrane after each emulsion phase in the cycle following pdrr represents the rate at which foulants physically adsorb at the surface of the membrane during filtration pdrr reversible fouling is characteristic of cake layer formation and can be removed via simple cleaning or rinsing action of higher significance to the interpretation of antifouling performance is the pdr irr which represents the rate at which the membrane is unable to regenerate its prior performance after cleaning unlike with reversible fouling there is a chemical interaction between the foulants and the membrane surface hence rendering the applied form of cleaning redundant rather than propose harsh techniques to remove this type of fouling on a membrane during operation it is more valuable to researchers to improve the design of the membrane to impede the rate of chemical interaction with the foulants therein the significance of incorporating hydrophilic elements that impart a hydration layer that shield membrane surfaces against oil adhesion 44 47 in fig 13 c and d m3 has the lowest pdr irr in both instances with 5 2 for gasoline and 11 3 for dichloromethane while that of m1 is calculated to be 14 5 and 22 6 respectively additionally despite having a lower uwoca with dcm than gasoline the antifouling performance of m3 after filtration of dcm was the best in comparison to m0 and m1 as evidenced by a prr of 82 7 m3 also shows the best performance in antifouling characteristics for gasoline with a prr of 91 4 which is double that of m1 45 and which compares favorably with current research data as shown in table 4 to further support the robust antifouling ability the air wca was measured after the composite membranes underwent pwp in phase v the contact angle of the m0 58 after filtration and cleaning with gasoline oil in water increased to 104 and 98 while that of m3 42 remained relatively stable at 50 and 57 for gasoline and dcm respectively 4 conclusion pei tio2 ga thin hybrid layers were fabricated on pes spsf tio2 mmms to generate pei tio2 ga mmms composite membranes suitable for efficient separation of various oil in water emulsions containing nano sized oil droplets in the range of 100 300 nm the effect of tio2 nps loadings on the thickness surface wettability surface charge and mwco of the hybrid layer was assessed using functional groups analysis the mechanism of layer formation was proven to be the result of aldimine condensation between carbonyl centers of ga and amine groups of pei as well hydrogen bonding interactions the end end chain stacking of pei ga groups in m1 pei ga mmm i e without tio2 was found to cause the formation of a dense surface coating with poor permeability and antifouling performance but had high selectivity ascribed to the reduced pore sizes in contrast the pei tio2 ga hybrid coatings had loosely packed chains which facilitated improved transport and reinforced antifouling properties owing to the presence of tio2 nps it was observed that at very high tio2 nps loadings 0 05 wt tio2 the hybrid layers became too loosely packed leading to reduced oil retention and increased permeability optimal pei tio2 ga mmm composite membrane m3 pei tio2 0 025 ga mmm displayed improved thermal permeance retention and antifouling characteristics the permeance of m3 was 62 lmh bar 1 which was 29 higher than m1 44 lmh bar 1 m3 was also able to reject 90 of various oil in water emulsions containing nano sized droplets at the range of 100 300 nm furthermore m3 also demonstrated enhanced underwater oleophobicity against gasoline hexane dcm and pe and a low wca which enabled the composite membrane to exhibit ideal antifouling performance in comparison to m1 conclusively pei tio2 ga hybrid coatings were established to be suitable for the effective separation of oil in

12834,polyethersulphone sulfonated polysulfone tio2 pes spsf tio2 ultrafiltration uf mixed matrix membranes mmms were coated with a hybrid layer composed of branched polyethyleneimine pei and tio2 nanoparticles nps crosslinked by glutaraldehyde ga to enhance its stability the effect of tio2 nps loadings on the thickness surface wettability surface charge and molecular weight cut off mwco was

mmms tio2 nps having abundant oh groups also increased electronegativity and hydrophilicity of the composite membranes at neutral ph the zeta potential changed from negative charge of mmms 33 mv into positive charge of m1 1 3 mv then into negative charge 7 4 mv in the optimum hybrid coated membrane pei tio2 0 025 wt ga mmms m3 the underwater oil contact angle uwoca of with hexane gasoline dichloromethane and petroleum ether was 165 167 164 and 135 respectively the air water contact angle wca of m3 was 42 which is lower than that of m1 63 it is important to note that m3 demonstrated a

membrane technology has continued to offer competent and sustainable solutions for the preservation and recovery of water resources in terms of the active treatment of challenging oily wastewater and associated emulsions membrane technology provides diversity towards meeting specific needs of recovery operations superior efficiency and convenient operationalization over other mechanical and chemical approaches such as flotation coagulation and centrifugation 1 2 significant efforts have been directed towards emulsified oily water as it is the hardest to eliminate this is because the water contains oil droplets that are minute in size 10 Î¼m and remain suspended in water due to surfactants 3 other types of oily wastewater such as floating oils and dispersed oils relatively larger than 10 Î¼m easily coalesce and form large droplets that can be easily removed 4 ultrafiltration uf membrane technology has proved to be successful in removing emulsified droplets due to its operational modus that is largely dependent on size exclusion however this also presents its greatest hurdle that is fouling has long been the focal motivation for numerous research activities seeking to alleviate it as it leads to deterioration in permeation and retention performance 1 5 polymer blending modification is the most standard approach applied for improving membrane antifouling performance the one pot and mostly one step technique is attractive for its simplicity generally all that is required is to mix the desired materials having specific properties polymer solvent and additives and the resulting membranes will exhibit the characteristics of the content materials 6 previously our group designed ultrafiltration uf mixed matrix membranes by blending polyethersulfone pes and sulfonated polysulfone spsf with incorporated small amounts of tio2 nps 7 findings from our work showed that the stable flat sheet membranes separated oil in water emulsions and maintained good permeation and performance tio2 nps aided in the modification of the porosity and improved the hydrophilicity and mechanical strength of the mmms however the uf mmms were found to be appropriate only for the separation of emulsions containing oil droplet sizes 500 nm and the antifouling properties were observed to be short lived rather than increase the content of tio2 content in the membranes which was found to expand the pore size and porosity of the membranes we sought to improve the surface properties of pes spsf tio2 membranes through coating the direct deposition of a coating layer on a membrane targets the enhancement of the membrane surface without interfering with the integrity of the bulk membrane this therefore provides flexibility for a wide range of possibilities on the types of organic materials 8 and inorganic materials 9 that could be utilized to design the layers findings show that the exposure of coated materials on the surface of the membranes can improve the performance as well as impart new features contrary to the blended materials approach where these desired features may be overpowered by the properties of the bulk polymers 10 combining both organic and inorganic materials to generate a hybrid functional layer is an efficient technique in surface coating the merits of this combination are that the organic component acts as a binder and pore size modifier while the inorganic component enhances hydrophilicity and imparts stabilization of the organic component tian et al 11 fabricated a composite functional layer from poly vinyl alcohol pva and carbon nanotubes cnts on a polyacrylonitrile pan substrate for the separation of surfactant stabilized oil in water emulsions the average pore size of cnts pan membrane was reduced to 250 nm from 900 nm of the pan membrane this improved the selectivity of the coated membrane to 93 removal of oil droplets compared to 50 of an oil in water emulsion containing droplet sizes 2 Î¼m furthermore the formation of the superhydrophilic hybrid coating from pva and cnts exhibited self cleaning properties after filtration of the emulsions elsewhere gao et al 12 generated hybrid films consisting of a double organic and an inorganic element from polydopamine pei and single walled carbon nanotubes for oil in water separation the pore sizes of the hybrid coating ranged between 5 and 14 nm which was effective in the separation of oil in water emulsions containing an average of 54 nm droplet size while maintaining nearly 100 flux recovery at different oil concentrations of oil content in the emulsions most recently yang et al 13 also established the benefits of combining organic and inorganic materials for oily wastewater treatment in their research two organic components carboxymethyl chitosan and tannic acid were combined with inorganic cu3 po4 2 on polyvinylidene fluoride via alternate quaternary soaking in the absence of the inorganic component cu3 po4 2 on the coating the generated membrane displayed poor permeability and antifouling performance while that containing cu3 po4 2 had up to 127 improvement in permeation at high oil removal rates 99 6 and excellent antifouling properties in these studies the combination of materials is similar i e organic and inorganic but the properties of the hybrid layers are tunable to achieve the desired selectivity and antifouling characteristics suited to the separation of varying oil in water separation owing to the synergistic effect mechanism of organic and inorganic components these flexible aspects of hybrid layers can be further explored based on the choice of materials other contributions to the synergistic interaction between organic and inorganic components cited by researchers are that inorganic elements in a hybrid layer prevent the rigid close stacking of normally long chained organic polymers while the resulting loosening of chain arrangement is advantageous for improving the permeation performance the physical integrity of the composite layer is compromised and therefore requires to be stabilized via crosslinking on a membrane surface to prevent erosion and degradation during application 14 for instance halakoo et al 15 utilized glutaraldehyde ga to crosslink the layers of pei with graphene oxide sheets while preparing pervaporation membranes elsewhere cao et al 16 employed trimesoylchloride tmc to crosslink pei and generate nanofiltration nf membranes for humic acid and dye removal liu et al 17 fabricated freestanding carbon nanotubes in pei solutions which were then crosslinked with tmc to increase rigidity and add more functional groups that contributed to increasing the effectiveness of the membrane for emulsion separation the objective of this study is to tailor a hydrophilic polyethyleneimine tio2 hybrid layer on pes spsf tio2 uf mmm to improve the antifouling and separation performance of oil in water emulsions containing nano sized oil droplets 500 nm among them pei as a versatile water soluble polymer is used as an organic coating during membrane fabrication its wide applicability stems from the fact that it is rich in amino groups that endow it with a strong positive charge 18 tio2 nps were chosen as the inorganic component in the coating because of their antifouling antibacterial chemical and thermal enhancing properties to begin with the crosslinking reaction between pei and ga was established to identify the optimum working concentrations afterward pei was then integrated with various concentrations of tio2 nps and after vacuum assisted deposition was then crosslinked with ga unlike in the use of tmc crosslinking with ga offers a greener reaction approach with aldimine condensation reactions between aldehyde and amine groups yielding water molecules while those with tmc yield hydrochloric acid that may require additional removal steps 18 the target is to utilize the interplay between tio2 nps pei and ga to generate a new model of hybrid coating with the potential to meet the current application needs the relationship of these three materials is interpreted as follows tio2 nps were stably bound to pei through hydrogen bonding with the nh2 groups then nh2 groups from pei undergo aldimine condensation with aldehyde groups from ga additionally oh groups from adsorbed water on the tio2 nps also reacted with the carbonyl center of ga further ensuring the stability of the coated layer on the membrane surface it is postulated that by regulating the concentrations of the organic and inorganic components of the hybrid layer its width and density can be tailored thereby to ideal width fit for optimal filtration performance the effect of tio2 nps loadings on the thickness surface wettability surface charge and mwco of the hybrid layer was investigated the filtration and antifouling efficiency of the generated composite membranes was analyzed using filtration

previous work 7 19 polymer and additive composition for the substrates are described in table 1 first a 0 075 wt tio2 from a 2 wt stock solution and a calculated amount of water were dispersed in dmac through ultrasonication for 30 min then pes spsf and peg polymers were dissolved in dmac and mixed with tio2 nps under continuous stirring at 50 1 c for 12 h to form homogenous casting solutions after degasification at the same temperature the solutions were cast onto a clean glass plate substrate using an automated membrane applicator elcometer 4340 england with a casting knife set at 200 Î¼m gap thickness and then immediately immersed in a deionized water bath 1 c the prepared membranes were stored in deionized water for 24 h before coating to ensure complete solvent removal the bulk porosity of the pes spsf tio2 mmms was calculated to be 82 4 1 5 using the dry wet method eq s1 furthermore utilizing results of the bulk porosity the membrane bulk pore radius was estimated to be 43 7 1 4 nm using the guerout elford ferry equation eq s2 as described in the supplementary information 2 3 vacuum assisted surface coating preliminary experiments were first conducted to determine the optimum concentration of pei 0 025 wt volume and post treatment parameters to use this was followed by investigating the optimal crosslinking concentration for ga to utilize briefly 10 ml of 0 025 wt pei was deposited onto a 16 6 cm2 pes spsf tio2 substrate sample under 0 09 mpa vacuum pressure the coated membrane was then thoroughly rinsed with 100 ml of di water after rinsing 10 ml of ga at different concentrations was deposited and allowed to crosslink with pei at 50 c for 45 min following this the membrane was rinsed with di water to remove unreacted groups and dried at 50 c for 3 min as shown in scheme 1 the membranes were then stored in pure water for later use the compositions of the pei ga coating layer are listed in table s1 as mg0 mg0 1 chemical group morphology and performance characterization techniques were utilized to establish that the optimum crosslinking concentrations for pei and ga were pei 0 025 wt ga 0 05 wt i e mg0 05 the hybrid layer was constructed by initially sonicating varying concentrations of tio2 nps dispersion 0 01 0 1 wt in optimal aqueous pei solution for 1 h 10 ml of the resulting pei tio2 ga solution was deposited on the mmms substrate using vacuum filtration following 10 ml of optimum ga concentration 0 05 wt was used to crosslink the pei tio2 ga layers at 50 c for 45 min finally the generated pei tio2 ga pes spsf tio2 composite membranes were rinsed and dried as previously described a breakdown of pei tio2 ga and ga concentrations used to coat the membranes is described in table 2 from table s1 mg0 05 was renamed to m1 0 wt tio2 the rest of the pei tio2 ga hybrid coated membranes with different concentrations of tio2 nps 0 01 0 1 wt were labeled m2 m6 respectively as displayed in table 2 2 4 characterization of membranes and membrane performance the size and shape of the tio2 nps dispersion fig s1 were determined by field emission transmission electron microscopy fe tem h7650 hitachi japan imagej image processing software was used to determine the average size of the nps which was found to be 19 nm the water uptake technique was employed to examine the physical behavior of membranes in water thereby showing the effect of coating and crosslinking the membranes membrane samples with a diameter of 20 mm were dried at 60 c under vacuum for 12 h the membranes were weighed and then soaked in di water for 24 h to allow for complete sorption before re weighing the samples were lightly dabbed with blotting paper to eliminate water drops adhering to the surface computation of the water sorption s was

potential was characterized by surpass 3 anton paar austria while the pore sizes of the substrate and coated membranes were calculated via the mwco method using different molecular weights of peg

eq 2 21 as follows 2 d 0 09 m w 0 44 where d is the size of the pore in nanometres nm and m w is the peg molecular weight in daltons thermal measurements of membrane samples of a specific area and

air wca and uwoca by kruss drop shape analyzer dsa25 germany vacuum dried membranes were mounted onto a microscope glass slide and a water droplet 2 Î¼l was dripped onto the membrane surface the air wca was measured at a static state for uwoca four different types of oils gasoline hexane pe and dcm were made to contact the surface of mounted membrane samples immersed in water 2 5 membrane filtration tests membrane filtration performance was carried out using a laboratory cross flow filtration construct as illustrated in scheme 2 the pump 0 10 bar pressure gauges flow meter and valves were supplied by shanghai jiaxing pumps co ltd china a recirculating water chiller model number dlsb 4 15 from zhengzhou keda machinery and instrument equipment co ltd china was used to maintain the feed at room temperature a custom made stainless steel membrane cell with an area of 7 07 cm2 diameter 3 cm was connected in cross flow mode between the feed tank and the permeate collection point as demonstrated in scheme 2 to collect data compaction was first conducted for 90 min at 0 3 mpa after stabilization the pressure was reduced to 0 25 mpa and the water permeance was recorded in l m2 h

different oil in water emulsion feeds were prepared by adding the mass ratio of the oils gasoline hexane pet ether and dichloromethane to sds surfactant 9 1 at 100 ppm aqueous solution mixing was conducted at 900 rpm for 12 h 22 emulsion droplet sizes were characterized using litesizer 500 anton paar austria particle analyzer based on weighted number frequency the assessment of the efficiency of the membranes to remove oil from the feed solution was determined based on the total organic carbon toc eq 4 4 r 1 t p t f 100 where r is the observed rejection of the membrane t p is the toc in the permeate and t f is the toc of the feed the oil concentration in the feed and permeate samples were determined using toc analyzer ndir method model shimadzu japan feed and permeate samples were diluted up to 1000 times before being fed into the analyzer antifouling assessment was conducted using an on off method for the system with the highest oil concentration a membrane was first used in the pure water filtration system and then transferred to the filtration set up where fouling occurred after each emulsion filtration phase the fouled membrane was cleaned with deionized water subsequently the pwp of the clean membranes was calculated using eq 3 and denoted as j w2 the entire process encompassed two cycles in five phases for a total of 300 min one cycle included a pure water filtration phase and an emulsion separation phase and a cleaning step two aspects were used to describe the antifouling properties the permeance decline ratio pdr and the permeance recovery rate prr pdr tot denotes the total fouling on a membrane during each emulsion filtration phase and was calculated via eq 5 5 pdr tot 1 j f j w 1 100 where j f is the feed permeance lmh bar 1 at phase ii

coatings and confirms the success of the methods used to fabricate membranes fig 1 shows comparative ft ir spectral characteristics of the substrate m0 and the composite membranes bulk polymer groups of m0 are represented by ch so3 and so2 at 2856 cm 1 2944 cm 1 1082 cm 1 and 1103 cm 1 respectively 23 a small absorption bend at 1646 cm 1 is ascribed to ti oh bonds resulting from adsorbed water on tio2 nps it confirms the incorporation of tio2 nps in the matrix 7 it is evident from fig 1 that the absorption band at 2944 cm 1 relates to the stretching vibration of ch2 this is broadened after the addition of crosslinked pei with ga in m1 indicating the contribution of methyl groups from ga and pei the wide band from 3000 3600 cm 1 represents the overlap of oh and nh2 groups 24 primary amine groups are also represented by a stretching vibration at 1576 cm 1 25 after the crosslinking of pei in m1 the intensity of the wide band at 3000 3600 cm 1 increased owing to the nh2 groups from pei further the band at 3000 3600 cm 1 decreased with the increase of tio2 nps concentration m1 the reason is that amine groups interact with tio2 nps especially a short sharp absorption appeared at 1542 cm 1 indicating the presence of protonated n h groups after the addition of tio2 to pei which can be observed in m3 m6 26 this type of ionization of amine groups in pei by aqueous ti oh dispersion as described in previous studies 27 two peaks can be used to highlight the difference in m1 and m2 m6 1659 cm 1 which is attributed to c n groups resulting from the condensation reaction between ga and pei in m1 begins to diminish in size for m2 m6 at the same time a bending vibration at 1717 cm 1 representing c o groups from ga emerges and intensifies in m2 m6 it implies that the interactions between c o groups from ga with nh2 groups from pei reduced in number upon the integration of tio2 nps 28 a detailed discussion on the crosslinking mechanism is presented in section 3 2 essentially ft ir demonstrates that tio2 nps were successfully integrated and that the desired interactions enabling the formation of a hybrid surface layer occurred additional qualitative and quantitative evaluation of functional groups of the coated membranes was conducted using xps as presented in fig 2 overall spectra in fig 2 a shows the presence of c 1 s at 285 ev o 1 s at 532 ev and s 2p at 167 5 ev for all membranes further n 1 s at 398 8 ev observed is ascribed to the presence of pei in pei ga and pei tio2 ga hybrid layer 3 a general peak demonstrating ti 2p is observed at 457 3 ev for pei tio2 ga layer confirming the presence and immobilization of tio2 nps on the surface of mmms fig 2 a since no obvious ti peak was observed in the substrate s xps spectrum due to its low concentration within the bulk membrane matrix raman spectroscopy analysis was used to determine the presence of the nps in the uf mmm substrate m0 as shown in fig s2 a peak at 517 cm 1 characteristic of tio bonds appeared in pes spsf tio2 uf mmm m0 7 the deconvoluted n 1 s peaks of m1 and m3 fig 2 b and c were utilized to elaborate the functional groups of the composite membranes m1 and m3 and further confirm the formation of the surface coating on the mmms the xps data corroborate the results found in ft ir first in fig 2 b pei ga mmm m1 containing crosslinked nh2 groups are detected at 400 2 ev cn nh and bridging n atoms are also detected at 398 8 ev 29 then upon the integration of tio2 nps the amine groups underwent protonation and were detected at 401 1 ev as demonstrated in fig 2 c 30 tio2 2p peak in m3 was identified at 458 3 ev and 463 8 ev 31 fig 2 d moreover atomic quantities of the elements supporting the above deductions are listed in table 3 m3 has a lower amount of nitrogen because the amine groups first interact with tio2 through hydrogen bonding and then undergo aldol condensation with ga groups therefore there are fewer free amine groups in m3 additionally tio2 nps impart the hybrid coating with a high content of oxygen which is beneficial towards increasing the hydrophilicity of the composite membrane 3 2 formation mechanism and the influence of tio2 nps before incorporating tio2 nps to the surface coating the optimum crosslinking reaction between pei versus ga was established table s1 and fig s3 it is proposed from literature that the mechanism of crosslinking with ga with pei initiates with the aldol condensation of ga molecules which dehydrate forming Î± Î² unsaturated aldehyde groups of ga the amine groups from pei then add to the unsaturated groups by attacking the carbonyl centers and follow through to another condensation reaction aldimine condensation generating cn unsaturated bonds as illustrated in fig 3 18 29 assessment of functional groups from ft ir was utilized to elaborate and confirm the formation of the surface coating fig s3 a small bend at 1600 cm 1 is observed establishing the formation of dehydrated unsaturated cc bonds in ga fig s3 32 the formation of cn bonds is represented by a brief and sharp band at 1659 cm 1 nh2 groups from pei correlate with the band at 1576 cm 1 crosslinking pei with sufficient quantity of ga increases the intensity of the band at 1659 cm 1 while that at 1576 cm 1 decreases i e as the amine groups are consumed in the aldmine condensation process more unsaturated cn bonds are formed represented by m1 spectrum in fig s3 from this analogy it is inferred that a small ratio of nh2 c n absorbance peaks will be representative of a high crosslinking degree as listed in table s2 23 the ratio of reactants in m1 is 1 2 pei ga an insufficient or excess quantity of ga is characterized by the appearance of a bend at 1717 cm 1 representative of unreacted c o groups as displayed in fig s3 b furthermore to supplement the crosslinking degree analysis the rigidity of the pei ga mmms is further described using the water sorption capacity as presented in table s2 a rigid structure will have poor water uptake and vice versa for a loosely packed structure 15 ti oh groups arising from adsorbed water molecules on tio2 nps facilitated the interaction of the nps with both pei and ga as shown in fig 4 first the protonation of amines resulted in hydrogen bonding interactions with tio2 ga then reacted with free amine groups and with tio2 nps through aldimine condensation and nucleophilic addition respectively though the interactions between ga and pei are decreased owing to the presence of tio2 nps the additional hydrogen bonding interactions between the molecules enhance stability and cohesiveness 33 ft ir spectra in fig 5 illustrates the difference in the band shifts between m1 and m3 m3 spectrum shows a peak at 1542 cm 1 representing the protonated amines ti oh bonds are indicated at 1644 cm 1 and finally unreacted carbonyl centers at 1717 cm 1 26 according to table s2 water uptake rates of m3 pei tio2 0 025 ga mmm were much higher than m1 pei ga mmm indicating a loosely crosslinked structure conclusively tio2 was successfully integrated with pei and aided in the formation of a loosely crosslinked but stable byrid layer by further interacting with ga through hydrogen bonding 3 3 morphological analysis of the coated membranes surface sem micrographs of the membranes are presented in fig 6 a visual comparison of the surface porosity of m1 to that of m0 shows a reduced number of exposed pores visible moieties protruding from the surface appear in m1 after crosslinking pei with ga the crosslinked masses become difficult to see after the crosslinking pei tio2 ga to the surface in m2 m7 composite membranes with ga 30 as demonstrated in the formation mechanism tio2 nps act as a chain disruptor and the hybrid coating possesses pore like gaps which are beneficial for permeance 34 this trend is observed in all pei tio2 ga mmms as demonstrated in fig 6 c g notably the tio2 is immobilized in a splotch pattern in m2 which contained the least amount of tio2 nps it is inferred the amount of tio2 nps was insufficient to be evenly distributed throughout the network of pei at the particular concentrations this is proven by the even dispersion of tio2 nps in m3 and m4 composite membranes a high tio2 loading in the deposited pei tio2 ga coating solution leads to the discontinuous layering of nps as observed in fig 6 f g for m5 and m6 composite membranes in m5 and m6 the pore like gaps between the nps widen as agglomeration becomes severe which may increase the risk of leaching during operation in addition roughness values in fig s4 corroborate the observations and deductions made from sem images the roughness of the composite membranes decreased from ra 9 1 0 6 nm m0 to ra 5 2 0 3 nm of m1 after the formation of crosslinked moieties that covered the surface of the membrane the roughness decreases further in m2 ra 3 8 0 04 nm after the integration of tio2 nps which help in the formation of a cohesive layer in contrast m3 shows a growth in roughness ra 4 7 0 6 nm it is deduced that the dense crosslinked moieties of pei ga in m1 exist as dense masses distributed on the surface of the membranes thereby creating deep grooves as shown in sem and tem micrographs in fig 6 b causing the high roughness of the layer following the addition of numerous spherical tio2 nps in m1 generates a relatively continuous network through interacting with both ga and pei via hydrogen bonding interaction hence causing a decrease in the roughness at 0 025 wt tio2 nps concentration in m3 the distribution of the nps is more closely arranged and therefore the roughness begins to slowly increase excess amounts of tio2 nps which were most likely agglomerated at higher concentrations caused a spike in the roughness of the composite membranes m5 ra 8 8 0 1 nm and m6 ra 12 1 0 3 nm as evidenced in fig s4 f g 35 to further support imaging analysis edx elemental mapping analysis was conducted on the surfaces of the membranes as shown in fig s5 a general overlay combined with the mapping of three core elements is presented for m1 and m2 n serves as the guiding element illustrating the distribution of coated materials as well as changes brought about by the crosslinking reaction it can be seen in fig s5 that n is clustered in m1 confirming the crosslinked structures observed in sem against a backdrop of o ti in m3 is specifically observed to appear in the areas where there is n 36 overall the coatings were homogeneously distributed in all membranes besides cross sectional imaging analysis in fig 6 shows the evolution of the layers as the coating components changed due to the high irregularity of the images of the hybrid coatings from sem images exhibited in fig 6 thickness assessment was based on tem micrographs after ultrathin microtome slicing of the membranes after the nips fabrication process the asymmetric structure of pes spsf tio2 substrate mmms in fig 6 a was characterized by a thin dense skin layer at the top surface and sponge structured sublayer membrane the thin top surface skin dense layer of m0 was measured to be 1 1 0 1 Î¼m pei ga and pei tio2 ga hybrid coatings were then coated on top of the dense thin skin layer m1 fig 6 b displayed a thick and irregular coating 341 36 nm due to crosslinked pei ga groups hence corroborating top surface observations after the introduction of tio2 the hybrid coating on the composite membrane became thinner and appeared to be more cohesive m2 223 41 nm and more so in m3 238 41 nm as displayed in fig 6 c and d respectively the pei tio2 ga hybrid layers continue to grow to a maximum of 627 13 nm for m6 as the content of tio2 nps is increased in the hybrid coating fig 6 g referring to fig 4 tio2 plays a role in the interruption and arrangement of crosslinked chains in the layer network the nps bind with amine groups of pei breaking the compact buildup of moieties when reacted with ga furthermore the carbonyl centers of Î± Î² unsaturated glutaraldehyde can interact with tio2 nps through hydrogen bonding ensuring a stable hybrid layer the better the distribution of tio2 the more improved the interconnection and organization between the molecules resulting in a homogenously distributed thin layer for as seen in m2 m3 and m4 heaped layers of high tio2 loadings accounted for the increased layer thicknesses as exhibited in sem images m5 and m6 as shown in fig 6 and edx images in fig s6 the regulation of a coating thickness is desirable for membrane filtration performance as it must not compromise the selectivity of the resulting composite membrane 37 3 4 properties of the membranes 3 4 1 mwco and thermal properties fig 7 demonstrates the mwco of the substrate and modified membranes determined from the filtration of 2 6 10 20 40 100 and 300 kda peg solutions 100 mg l according to the mwco assessment the all the membranes are in the ultrafiltration range albeit at different degrees a high crosslinking degree in m1 caused the membrane to have a low mwco at 8 5 kda it implies that the membrane will have a high selectivity during filtration under membrane filtration classification m1 falls well within the tight ultrafiltration tuf category at an average pore size of 4 5 nm tuf membranes have been extensively used for the separation of dyes organic solutes and some salts at low pressures 4 in a word the mwco assessment of the composite membranes is in agreement with the morphology and formation mechanism analysis it is also found from fig 7 that as the concentration of tio2 nps increases in the hybrid layer the coated membranes show increasing mwco i e m2 15 kda 6 3 nm m3 27 kda 8 0 nm m4 35 kda 9 1 nm m5 38 kda 9 4 nm and m6 40 kda 9 6 nm the changes in mwco are accredited to the inter chain spaces which would improve mass transport as observed in the surface imaging results fig 6 according to our previous study the resultant pes sps tio2 uf mmms displayed poor separation performance for oil in water emulsions containing droplets 500 nm owing to the large pore size 7 herein a pore size of 10 nm for a hybrid coating should be optimal for the removal of nano sized oil droplets of 100 nm as reported in the literature 12 fig 8 shows tga curves of the uf mmm and composite membranes all the membranes show four decomposition phases which can be associated with the chemical content of the membranes and the chemical interactions occurring in the membranes in the first phase at 100 200 c all the composite membranes pei tio2 ga 0 0 1 wt coating layers show a higher mass loss and decomposition rate than the substrate m0 38 this initial phase is related to the loss of water and any residual solvent this is because these membranes coated by pei adsorb more surface water than the substrate clearly the effect gradually decreases as the temperature is elevated with increasing saturation of inorganic tio2 nps content in the composite membrane in the second phase at around 200 450 c the decomposition is attributed to the pyrolysis of more thermally stable groups such as so3 belonging to spsf in m0 19 additionally the composite membranes with a pei tio2 ga hybrid layer exhibit a slower rate of decomposition at this temperature region as a result of chemical crosslinks and hydrogen bond interactions with pei from this it is evident that the composite membranes display improved thermal stability in comparison with the uf mmm substrate 34 in the third phase from 480 to 600 c the major mass loss observed is associated with the decomposition of the polymer backbones beyond 600 c there is an obvious distinction between the composite membranes and the uf mmms in particular m6 shows a maximum resistance to thermal degradation at this stage this is ascribed to the high tio2 nps content that absorbs more heat and has high thermal resistance furthermore for the composite membranes a slight mass loss at around 700 c marks the degradation of oxygen stable groups remaining in the polymer backbone any substance residue after 800 c is inorganic residue 33 the weight of the residue correlates with the expected content of tio2 nps in the composite membranes in brief overall tga analysis proves that pei tio2 ga hybrid coating layer endowed the composite membranes with high thermal stability 3 4 2 surface charge and wettability properties of the membranes in general the surface modification method is suitable for generating tunable surface charges surface charge of the uf substrate and surface coated membranes is demonstrated in fig 9 the zeta potential of m0 displays a high negative charge density around 33 0 2 9 mv which originates from a certain amount of spsf with so3 groups in m0 interestingly the zeta potential of m1 exhibits a positive charge of around 1 3 0 4 mv this demonstrates the charge reversing ability of pei owing to its high nh2 content 30 it is noted that the isoelectric point of 0 025 wt pei was measured and found to be 10 94 before the vacuum assisted deposition was performed after crosslinking with 0 05 wt ga a near zero surface charge is obtained confirming the consumption of nh2 groups during the aldimine condensation reaction other research has found similar tendencies after chemically crosslinking pei with appropriate amounts of cross linker 39 40 it also can be seen from fig 9 that the zeta potential of the composite membranes is quickly altered and grows in electronegativity by the addition of tio2 nps in addition the zeta potential of the composite membranes gradually changed from 2 9 0 8 mv to 17 3 1 5 mv with the increase of tio2 nps content from 0 01 wt m2 to 0 1 wt m6 in the hybrid layer it is well known that the surface charge of a membrane determines the interaction of the membrane surface and foulant ultimately affecting its separation performance except size exclusion electro neutrality in a membrane is uniquely beneficial for the fractionation of charged solutes having different sizes because separation will be dependent on the size exclusion mechanism 40 however the majority of organic compounds in water such as humic acids have an overall negative charge the lack of charge on a membrane surface hampers its repelling ability which influences antifouling alternatively a negatively charged membrane is beneficial for repelling foulants having negative charge such as oil droplets distant from the membrane surface 5 41 additionally wca and uwoca tests using gasoline were used to demonstrate the wettability properties of the composite membranes in an air environment as shown in fig 10 distinctly the uf mmm substrate and composite membranes can be defined as hydrophilic since all the wcas are below 90 6 among of them m1 has the highest wca of 63 compared with the other membranes which derives from the minimal charge on the membrane surface from zeta potential analysis m1 with a very low surface charge indicates the lack of charged functional groups on the surface contrary to the surface charge of m0 and the pei tio2 ga composite membranes 40 in addition the tightly packed and dense pei ga network impede the penetration of water molecules whereas the more loosely packed chains of pei tio2 ga hybrid hydrophilic layer on the mmms readily allow water transport it has been well established that membrane surfaces with low wcas demonstrate increased resistance to oil adhesion in the presence of water uwoca predicts the interaction of oil droplets with the membranes and simulates the interaction during filtration and therefore antifouling characteristics a membrane with ideal uwoca properties usually displays high antifouling performance 41 42 as shown in fig 10 all the pei tio2 ga composite membranes possess very high underwater oleophobicity i e 160 such as m2 163 m3 167 m4 169 m5 166 and m6 164 in water hydroxy groups endowed water molecules adsorbed on tio2 nps contribute to the interaction with water molecules to form a protective hydration layer on the membrane surface thereby increasing resistance to oil adhesion as such for m0 some oil molecules were able to penetrate through the membrane because the surface lacked sufficient hydrophilic groups to form a robust oil repelling hydration layer 11 13 17 3 5 permeation and separation performance of the membranes typically the water permeance behavior of the membranes correlates well with the mwco profile of the membranes the substrate with largest pores m0 exhibits the highest pure water permeance pwp 162 9 lmh bar 1 and oil in water emulsion permeance 122 2 lmh bar 1 as shown in fig 11 in contrast m1 with the smallest pore size had the lowest pwp of 44 1 lmh bar 1 and oil in water emulsion feed permeance of 25 8 lmh bar 1 30 the significance of incorporating tio2 nps is observed by the filtration performance of the composite membranes for instance the pwp of the composite membranes improves by 17 to 52 9 lmh bar 1 for m2 with 0 01 wt tio2 nps loading and by 49 to 86 2 lmh bar 1 for m6 with 0 1 wt tio2 nps the two composite membranes with the higher tio2 loadings i e m5 and m6 also display loosely compacted hybrid coatings leading to a reduced resistance to permeability under pressure beyond a certain point excess loading is disadvantageous as it may result in leaching of the nps and subsequently part of the surface layer which would reduce the membrane performance over time as evidenced by the large error bar in the filtration of oil in water emulsion for m6 prior to determining the retention performance of the membranes for emulsion separation it was found that the average oil droplet size of gasoline oil in water emulsion was 115 1 9 nm as illustrated in fig s7 b as anticipated m1 composite membrane with a 4 8 nm pore size demonstrated the highest retention of the nano emulsion at 97 6 as shown in fig 11 b further the oil rejection of the composite membranes progressively decreased from 96 5 m2 to 95 3 m3 88 8 m4 84 3 m5 and 81 6 m6 evidently the increasing pore sizes of the pei tio2 ga composite membranes displayed classic trade off performance for an investigation into the wider applicability of the composite membranes m3 was evaluated for the rejection of other types of oil in water emulsions namely those containing hexane dcm and pe as illustrated in fig 12 a the measured uwoca values of these oils with the substrate m0 pei ga mmm m1 and pei tio2 0 025 ga mmms m3 are shown in fig 12 b it can be concluded that the hybrid membrane coating was effective for improving the retention of nanoemulsions since all the oil in water emulsions contained oil droplets in the range of 110 300 nm as displayed in fig s7 for instance the rejection of hexane emulsion by m0 m1 and m3 was 55 7 95 4 and 93 4 respectively this relatively low rejection is ascribed to the small droplet size 110 nm of hexane in water emulsion in comparison to pe which has three times larger oil droplet size 305 nm and showed much better retention by m0 65 9 m1 99 9 and m3 97 1 fig 12 a while using mmms for the separation of oil in water emulsions it is shown that larger oil droplets are prone to coalesce and are thus more easily rejected contemporary literature work listed in table 4 shows that m3 performs well in comparison with other membranes used for the separation of oil in water emulsions containing nanosized oil droplets it is notable from the separation performance in fig 12 a that dcm shows less retention for m0 50 1 and m3 91 0 despite the fact that the dcm oil in water emulsion has a larger oil droplet size of 255 nm fig s11 c this is because dcm contains polar groups unlike gasoline hexane and pe allowing partial dcm miscibility with water consequently while under water dcm droplets adsorb on the negatively charged membrane surface to a certain extent this tendency is demonstrated in the wetting analysis using uwoca of dcm with m0 74 and m3 135 in fig 12 b whereas m1 is 145 it has been demonstrated that an effective way to remedy the wettability of a membrane surface against polar and nonpolar oils is to endow the membrane with hydroxy groups thereby imparting underwater super oleophobicity 20 membrane fouling by oils during filtration has been identified to be different from other types of foulants which fit into conventional mechanisms classified by hermia 46 standard partial and complete pore blocking and cake formation although the eventual outcome of fouling by oil is cake formation oil droplet fouling has been described to be different from the aforementioned models as the oil emulsions deform coalesce or split into smaller droplets under pressure 5 41 interaction of oil droplets with the membrane surface and pores is predicated on the inherent properties of the membrane specifically morphology hydrophilicity and pore properties the membrane materials and fabrication technique hence come into play to tailor these properties experimental observations have consistently shown that increased membrane surface hydrophilicity enhances its antifouling properties towards oil emulsion feeds 6 9 47 scheme 3 summarizes the filtration performance mechanism of the composite membranes 3 6 antifouling performance of the membranes oil in water emulsion feeds prepared from gasoline and dcm were used to demonstrate the antifouling characteristics and robustness of the membranes over long operations as demonstrated in fig 13 a b which illustrate the permeance decline and revival patterns of the membranes during filtration cycling of the two feed types although m0 maintains the highest flux due to its large pores it also shows a steep decline in pwp it shows a less than ideal capacity to regenerate water permanence which decreases from 162 lmh bar 1 to 117 lmh bar 1 after two emulsion filtration phases and three pwp cycles the water permanence of m0 was much lower after conducting filtration with dcm 98 lmh bar 1 clearly the greater decline during the filtration of dcm is ascribed to its affinity towards the oil and also the feed has larger oil droplet sizes than gasoline that is to say the buildup of the droplets on the surface was accelerated although m1 previously demonstrated excellent retention fig 13 a b illustrate that it had very poor regenerative ability m1 exhibited the lowest performance in both of the antifouling assessment systems after 5 h of filtration the water permeance of m1 dropped to less than half its initial value 19 lmh bar 1 from 44 lmh bar 1 in both instances the main factors affecting the antifouling performance of m1 are the surface charge pore size and the density of the surface coating since m1 has the lowest surface charge and smallest pore sizes it is difficult to rid the oil droplets that are trapped in the grooves of the dense crosslinks moreover owing to the low surface charge there lacks a repellant force preventing the adherence of the oil droplets to the surface alternatively m3 comprises a more permeable hybrid coating bearing hydroxy groups that impede the adhesion of oil droplets hence allowing it to regenerate more easily after cleaning the pdr tot describes the rate at which foulants accumulate on the membrane after each emulsion phase in the cycle following pdrr represents the rate at which foulants physically adsorb at the surface of the membrane during filtration pdrr reversible fouling is characteristic of cake layer formation and can be removed via simple cleaning or rinsing action of higher significance to the interpretation of antifouling performance is the pdr irr which represents the rate at which the membrane is unable to regenerate its prior performance after cleaning unlike with reversible fouling there is a chemical interaction between the foulants and the membrane surface hence rendering the applied form of cleaning redundant rather than propose harsh techniques to remove this type of fouling on a membrane during operation it is more valuable to researchers to improve the design of the membrane to impede the rate of chemical interaction with the foulants therein the significance of incorporating hydrophilic elements that impart a hydration layer that shield membrane surfaces against oil adhesion 44 47 in fig 13 c and d m3 has the lowest pdr irr in both instances with 5 2 for gasoline and 11 3 for dichloromethane while that of m1 is calculated to be 14 5 and 22 6 respectively additionally despite having a lower uwoca with dcm than gasoline the antifouling performance of m3 after filtration of dcm was the best in comparison to m0 and m1 as evidenced by a prr of 82 7 m3 also shows the best performance in antifouling characteristics for gasoline with a prr of 91 4 which is double that of m1 45 and which compares favorably with current research data as shown in table 4 to further support the robust antifouling ability the air wca was measured after the composite membranes underwent pwp in phase v the contact angle of the m0 58 after filtration and cleaning with gasoline oil in water increased to 104 and 98 while that of m3 42 remained relatively stable at 50 and 57 for gasoline and dcm respectively 4 conclusion pei tio2 ga thin hybrid layers were fabricated on pes spsf tio2 mmms to generate pei tio2 ga mmms composite membranes suitable for efficient separation of various oil in water emulsions containing nano sized oil droplets in the range of 100 300 nm the effect of tio2 nps loadings on the thickness surface wettability surface charge and mwco of the hybrid layer was assessed using functional groups analysis the mechanism of layer formation was proven to be the result of aldimine condensation between carbonyl centers of ga and amine groups of pei as well hydrogen bonding interactions the end end chain stacking of pei ga groups in m1 pei ga mmm i e without tio2 was found to cause the formation of a dense surface coating with poor permeability and antifouling performance but had high selectivity ascribed to the reduced pore sizes in contrast the pei tio2 ga hybrid coatings had loosely packed chains which facilitated improved transport and reinforced antifouling properties owing to the presence of tio2 nps it was observed that at very high tio2 nps loadings 0 05 wt tio2 the hybrid layers became too loosely packed leading to reduced oil retention and increased permeability optimal pei tio2 ga mmm composite membrane m3 pei tio2 0 025 ga mmm displayed improved thermal permeance retention and antifouling characteristics the permeance of m3 was 62 lmh bar 1 which was 29 higher than m1 44 lmh bar 1 m3 was also able to reject 90 of various oil in water emulsions containing nano sized droplets at the range of 100 300 nm furthermore m3 also demonstrated enhanced underwater oleophobicity against gasoline hexane dcm and pe and a low wca which enabled the composite membrane to exhibit ideal antifouling performance in comparison to m1 conclusively pei tio2 ga hybrid coatings were established to be suitable for the effective separation of oil in
