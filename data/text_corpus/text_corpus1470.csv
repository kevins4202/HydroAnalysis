7350,the fertile crescent fc region comprises the east coast of the mediterranean sea and the northern part of the arabian peninsula the fc suffered two severe drought episodes separated by a 7 year period in 1998 2000 and 2007 2009 which are considered the most severe episodes to hit the region in the last 50 years a lagrangian model flexpart and era interim data with a 1 1 lat long resolution were used to identify for the first time the climatological sources of moisture for the fc and their characteristics variability and the source receptor relationships concerning their contribution to the precipitation and the implications regarding the transport of moisture changes over the fc during the wet season october may from 1980 to 2014 were analysed the main climatological moisture sources during this period were determined to be the fc itself the eastern mediterranean sea the red sea the persian gulf the arabian sea the caspian and black seas and the central and western parts of the mediterranean sea the analysis showed higher anomalous conditions in the moisture transport from some moisture sources during the two outstanding drought episodes the key feature of the wet seasons during these episodes was a deficit in the moisture losses over the studied area related to the fc itself the red and arabian seas sources followed and to a lesser extent by the eastern mediterranean sea over the northern part of the fc region nevertheless the moisture supply deficit from the sources was much greater during the 2007 2009 drought event the spei index at large scales 24 months showed that the 2007 2009 episode was part of longer term drought conditions that had been developing over the previous months reinforcing the drought severity given recycling processes attributed to the fc during the two extreme drought episodes the mountainous terrain over the northern and eastern fc suffered the highest precipitation deficits and these areas are precisely the most influenced by two of the major moisture sources namely the fc and eastern mediterranean sea the decreased moisture contribution from these main sources led to more intense droughts over the region as a result both regions should be considered as hotspots to signal severe or extreme droughts in the region keywords fertile crescent drought episodes moisture budget lagrangian analysis spei 1 introduction being prone to severe droughts together with a range of complex socio economic impacts barlow et al 2016 hoerling et al 2012 hemming et al 2010 giorgi and lionello 2008 the middle east generally experiences severe water stresses el kenawy et al 2016 and is a known climate change hotspot giorgi 2006 some parts of the middle east have experienced a severe reduction in water resources during the last decades particularly during the periods from 1998 to 2000 and 2007 2009 in the culturally rich fertile crescent fc region the fc regions includes syria iraq jordan lebanon palestine israel a small strip of southern turkey and western parts of iran marsh and alagona 2016 during the drought years from 1998 to 2000 and 2007 2009 the fc region suffered its most intense and prolonged droughts since 1940 trigo et al 2010 severe effects were experienced in the affected countries in terms of agricultural production rural livelihoods migration urban economic base and ecosystem decline erian et al 2012 unisdr 2011 while a lack of precipitation is considered the main factor contributing to drought occurrence other factors can also cause or enhance droughts such as more intense but less frequent precipitation or excessive evapotranspiration over different time periods and spatial extents e g dai 2011 vicente serrano et al 2012 kelley et al 2015 highlighted some of these factors which together made the drought episode of 2007 2009 the worst experienced by the fc in recent years among other factors these authors stressed that above normal air temperatures dominated the years leading up to 2007 which increased evaporation and led to reduced soil moisture groundwater and streamflow that consequentially worsened the severity of the drought kelley et al 2015 droughts are defined as prolonged periods of abnormally dry weather resulting in water shortages that can lead to serious hydrological imbalances in the affected areas glickman 2000 because of the complex nature of droughts it is difficult to achieve a comprehensive theory that fully explains the generation of these events liu et al 2004 it is therefore important to study the mechanisms responsible for the decline of precipitation over the sinks or any decrease in evaporation from the sources or both that form the dominant trigger of a drought over a region or intensify it a general relationship between source moisture transport deficits and droughts was hypothesized in the review article by gimeno et al 2012 and dirmeyer et al 2014 found significant changes in evaporative moisture during times of drought over the last two decades there have been several studies which assessed this relationship for droughts in specific regions example studies include the 2012 drought in the iberian peninsula by peterson et al 2013 the 2012 and 1998 great plains droughts by drumond et al 2016 weaver et al 2009 and dirmeyer and brubaker 1999 droughts in china by liu et al 2017 and drumond et al 2012 and droughts in africa as presented by d abreton and tyson 1995 and sorí et al 2017 to better understand the links between source moisture transport deficits and droughts the inclusion of a wide quantity of study areas could improve our knowledge of the physical processes leading to the formation and persistence of droughts over different regions kam et al 2014 liu et al 2004 the resulting knowledge could provide information about more appropriate uses of water resources during these extreme hazard events with regard to moisture transport over the mediterranean several studies have investigated this topic using different methodologies across the region as a whole e g mariotti et al 2002 nieto et al 2010 schicker et al 2010 gómez hernández et al 2013 or in specific regions such as southern europe e g fernandez et al 2003 gimeno et al 2010 sahel e g nieto et al 2006 salih et al 2015 and the ethiopian highlands e g viste and sorteberg 2012 2013 tubi et al 2017 investigated moisture transport by tropical plumes over the middle east and identified two main moisture pathways one originating in tropical west africa and another that emanates from east to central africa however to our knowledge this research topic has not been fully explored for the fc region therefore the main goals of the present study were to identify the main sources of atmospheric moisture over the fc during the wet season october to may using the lagrangian method developed by stohl and james 2004 2005 and to study the characteristics of these sources during the two severe drought episodes from 1998 to 2000 and 2007 2009 to these ends we tracked air masses from the fc backward in time to detect the regions where moisture uptake by the air masses reached the target region we then forward tracked the particles originating from these sources to investigate how they lost moisture within the atmospheric column over the fc the paper is organized as follows the description of the data the identification of the drought episodes the lagrangian method and the experiments are presented in section 2 a detailed characterisation of the moisture sources and their temporal variability are given in section 3 in section 4 we described and analysed anomalies in the moisture sources during the two severe drought episodes that occurred in the fc our overall conclusions are provided in section 5 2 data and methods this study was based on the method developed by stohl and james 2004 2005 which used the flexpart v9 0 lagrangian particle dispersion model with european reanalysis era interim reanalysis data dee et al 2011 to track changes in atmospheric moisture along air mass trajectories nieto et al 2008 drumond et al 2008 gimeno et al 2013 drumond et al 2014 2016 2 1 lagrangian methodology in the lagrangian approach the atmosphere is divided homogeneously into a large number of finite elements hereafter particles with constant mass m stohl and james 2004 these particles are advected using a three dimensional wind dataset two horizontal dimensions and one vertical and superimposed with stochastic turbulence and convective motions changes in the specific moisture q of each particle with time e p m dq dt where m is the mass of the particle represents the increases through evaporation e and decreases through precipitation p in moisture along the trajectories this method may be run backward or forward in time and allows for the identification of the sources and sinks of the moisture for the air particles that enter or leave a predefined region through the calculation of dq dt along the path of each particle both the locations of these particles and q are recorded every 6 h by adding e p for all the tracked particles observed in the atmospheric column over a given area we obtain the surface freshwater flux e p where e denotes the evaporation rate and p denotes the precipitation rate per unit area in the e p two dimensional maps the sources are identified by positive values of e p which characterise those areas where evaporation dominates the precipitation in the freshwater budget sinks on the other hand are those areas where air particles lose moisture to the environment and they are characterized by negative values of e p where precipitation dominates evaporation a complete description of the method and its limitations are discussed by stohl and james 2004 2005 the method is mostly limited by the use of a time derivative for the humidity in which numerical errors associated with the temporal variations in the moisture present in a particle can be taken as the moisture fluxes stohl and james 2004 therefore the success of this method strongly depends on the accuracy of the meteorological input data gimeno et al 2012 however given that there are a large number of particles in an atmospheric column any errors may cancel each other stohl and james 2004 an additional limitation of this approach is that only the net moisture gained or lost by the tracked air mass can be calculated but not the evaporation or precipitation individually another source of uncertainty is derived from the assumption that every particle has constant mass whereas the mass of the real atmosphere changes through the gain or loss of moisture stohl and james 2004 regardless this lagrangian approach has been used worldwide during the last decades in a paper by gimeno et al 2012 the advantages and disadvantages of the method was reviewed and compared with other methods such as eulerian methods box models or isotopes analyses between the models it is remarkable that the lagrangian method is only one that allows the position of the moisture sources to be defined with a higher precision the flexpart data set used in this study was the output of a global simulation in which the entire global atmosphere was divided into approximately 2 0 million particles with a 10 day tracking period which represents the average residence time of water vapour in the atmosphere numaguti 1999 the tracks were computed using the era interim reanalysis data available at 6 h intervals from 1980 to 2014 at a resolution of 1 x1 with 61 vertical levels from 1000 to 0 1 hpa the era interim data may be considered the state of art reanalysis in terms of the hydrological cycle trenberth et al 2011 in comparison with other data sets and lorenz and kunstmann 2012 demonstrated that currently the reanalysis data gives the most reasonable agreement between observational datasets and the atmospheric and terrestrial water balance here we analysed the e p values integrated over the 10 day tracking period using a backward analysis it was possible to identify the moisture sources of the air particles that reached the fc which are those regions where the air particles gain moisture as they travel towards the target area it is important to recall that climatological moisture sources defined through the backward analysis take into account the identification of all air particles that reach the fc independently of the associated gains losses of moisture over the target area using the output data of the global experiment all air particles over the fc were identified daily during the wet season from october may for the period from 1980 to 2014 and even non precipitating particles were tracked backward the spatial domain of the major moisture sources for the fc were determined using the percentile method drumond et al 2014 applied over the average of the e p 0 for the wet season during 1980 2014 a complete description of the identification of the sources is provided in section 3 1 an additional backward experiment was carried out to identify which of the major selected sources intensified during rainfall episodes over the fc to this end we applied a backward analysis but only for the rainy days as defined using the method of raziei et al 2012 as those days when at least 10 of all the grid points in the domain of interest in the fc 59 grid points in this case received precipitation totals 5 mm these criteria were used to exclude rainfall generated by local convection or orographic mechanisms and to eliminate days with the lowest precipitation amounts raziei et al 2012 rainy days were selected during the wet season using the daily mean precipitation dataset obtained from the global precipitation climatological project database gpcp in version 1 2 at a grid of 1 in latitude and longitude available at http precip gsfc nasa gov available only for the years 1996 2014 bolvin 2009 once the major sources of moisture had been detected a forward analysis allowed the identification of moisture sinks for air particles leaving each source of the fc the purpose was to estimate the moisture lost by the air masses to the atmosphere over the fc and to determine which areas inside the fc were more affected by moisture transport from the different sources 2 2 the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei the relative importance of the two drought episodes of interest in comparison with the remainder of events occurring from 1980 to 2014 in the fc was evaluated using the standardised precipitation evapotranspiration index spei this is an index based on climatic water balance i e the difference between precipitation pre and the atmospheric evaporative demand vicente serrano et al 2010 usually accounted for by means of the potential evapotranspiration pet this index is equally sensitive to changes in the precipitation and the pet and it works as a pure climate balance in which as a difference of the palmer drought severity index the precipitation and the pet have the same weight in the index values vicente serrano et al 2015 therefore the spei is more sensitive to evaporative demand than other commonly used droughts indices during droughts in arid and semi arid regions cook et al 2014 tao et al 2014 törnros and menzel 2014 such as the fc at the same time the calculation is simple and can be calculated on different time scales the time scale term is essential for understanding drought occurrences and severity edwards and mckee 1997 it refers to the different cumulative times of the meteorological variables pre and pet used to calculate the index this is advantageous because different hydrological agricultural and environmental systems and regions can respond to drought conditions on very different time scales vicente serrano and lópez moreno 2005 vicente serrano et al 2012 2013 lópez moreno et al 2013 ji and peters 2003 the spei was computed using the monthly climatic research unit cru ts3 23 climate dataset harris et al 2014 available online at https crudata uea ac uk cru data hrg cru ts 3 23 with a spatial resolution of 0 5 the drought episodes were identified for different spei timescales namely a short timescales 1 3 and 6 months which usually relate to soil moisture deficits e g scaini et al 2015 b moderate timescales 12 months relating to streamflow deficits e g lópez moreno et al 2013 and c long timescales 24 months which relate to groundwater level deficits potop et al 2014 ye et al 2015 the monthly values of the spei were classified according to severity into four categories mild 0 99 spei 0 normal 1 49 spei 1 severe 1 99 spei 1 5 or extreme spei 2 using the spei we can specify the onset and the end of a drought episode which begins when the spei value first falls below zero followed by a value of 1 or less and ends when the spei returns to a positive value mckee et al 1993 tan et al 2015 3 fertile crescent climatology overview in terms of temperature and precipitation the fc is classified as an arid to semi arid region with cool and wet winters from october may wet season and hot and dry summers from june september dry season the fc has a strong precipitation gradient from the wet mountain areas located in the north and northeast taurus and zagros mountains respectively reaching 1000 mm to a very dry regime in the south near the arabian desert where the precipitation amount does not exceed 200 mm rainfall mostly occurs during the wet season with a maximum in december february while the summer months are considered practically dry trigo et al 2010 precipitation over the fc is mostly produced from three systems cyclonic disturbance over the mediterranean convective precipitation created via strong convective instability given sufficient water vapour and orographic rainfall evans et al 2004 in this context the role played by mesoscale convective systems are relevant because they contribute to 70 to the rainfall al zuhairi et al 2016 in the wet season the fc is influenced by two broad groups of storm tracks created over the mediterranean both bringing considerable precipitation to the region in the first storm track group waves move rapidly in the upper troposphere that cross the area between southern turkey and jordan the maximum precipitation associated with these disturbances occurs during winter in syria jordan and over the zagros mountains the second storm track group contains stationary cyclones moving eastwards that become semi stationary over the north of iraq where they are supplied by moist air from the persian gulf in the south and as consequence they also cause precipitation over the zagros mountains as the season progresses into spring the low systems move further north and their effects over the fc decrease barlow et al 2016 beaumont et al 1988 another system that affects the climatology in this region is the red sea trough rst it is a low level pressure trough extending from the african monsoon trough over equatorial africa passing over the red sea towards the eastern mediterranean el fandy 1948 playing a crucial role in transferring moisture from the tropics to the fc from autumn to spring tsvieli and zangvil 2005 when the rst coincides with extratropical cyclones coming from the mediterranean unstable conditions can develop and flooding can occur therefore in this case it is referred to as being active krichak et al 2012 evans and smith 2006 showed that despite most precipitation events in the fc resulting from moisture fluxes from the mediterranean sea southern fluxes from the red sea and the persian gulf can lead to the largest precipitation events because a significant amount of water vapour can be transported into the fc by the formation of a mountain barrier jet to the west of the zagros mountains any change in these southern fluxes may therefore have a clear effect on the fresh water deposited in the fc region evans and alsamawi 2011 orographic precipitation dominates the mountain chains surrounding the area when sufficient amounts of water vapour reach this area and rise over the slopes trigo et al 2010 although precipitation is lower during summer months june september the greatest amounts of water vapour occurs over the region during this time due to the surplus of moisture and higher temperatures that accompany the expansion of the indian monsoon that covers most of the middle east the rainfall deficit is attributed to the absence of dynamic factors that favour the upward motion necessary for rainfall in fact a downward motion or subsidence occurs over the fc because of a cell circulation created by increasing temperatures over the iranian plateau leading to an ascending flow and a descending flow over the western side of the zagros mountains this configuration also causes the westerlies to recurve parallel to the mountains flowing to the southeast rather than rising over them as in winter evans et al 2004 4 characterization of the moisture sources and their temporal variability 4 1 determination of the moisture sources for the fc and an estimation of the arriving air masses moisture gains the fc is characterized by a strong precipitation gradient from the wet mountain regimes located along the mediterranean coastal mountain ranges in the west from the taurus mountains in the north and from the zagros mountains in the east to a very dry regime in the southern regions adjacent to the arabian desert the rainfall mostly occurs from october may wet season with a maximum occurring in december january and february while june september is considered the dry season trigo et al 2010 the detection of the moisture sources e p 0 using the lagrangian approach described has been applied for first time to the fc area with this study focusing on the wet season october may for 1980 2014 different percentiles were applied with the purpose of identifying areas presenting the highest net uptake of atmospheric moisture associated with air masses traveling towards the fc following the same demarcations as trigo et al 2010 the fc region in this work is defined as the orange area in fig 1 b fig 1a shows the mean climatological values of the e p 0 obtained via a backward experiment over the fc for the wet season during the 10 days of analysed trajectories the percentile values of the contour lines were plotted and table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the nine selected sources eight maritime sources and the fc itself applying the different percentiles thresholds 0 90 0 96 0 98 and 0 99 over the obtained e p 0 field from fig 1a is it possible to observe that a large area extending from the eastern mediterranean region towards the persian gulf acts as the major moisture source for the fc 0 99 percentile contour 0 1 mm day to include the maximum number of sources the maritime sources were all delimited by the 0 90 percentile 0 004 mm day these sources included the red sea the persian gulf the gulf of oman the arabian sea the caspian and the black seas and the complete mediterranean sea we considered the central and western mediterranean sources separately as they showed areas with higher values of e p 0 reaching the 0 98 percentile 0 04 mm day in fact they display different patterns of circulation in the area because the sicily island separates the sources and they are quite independent in terms of orographic injections recirculation and currents as described by millan et al 1997 2002 beside this previous studies of the mediterranean seas as sources of moisture used this same division nieto at al 2010 schicker et al 2010 the eastern mediterranean was delimited by the 0 99 percentile isoline in the maritime area and by the coastal line to the east the fc itself was also considered as a source of moisture fig 1b summarizes these sources schematically the importance of the mediterranean in providing moisture for precipitation processes over the middle east was mentioned by evans et al 2004 the fact that the fc itself is a source of moisture despite being an arid or semi arid region is in concordance with the paradox that deserts act as a net moisture source starr and peixoto 1958 pike 1970 deserts evaporate more moisture than they receive precipitation and shay el et al 1999 found that if the moisture flux divergence is averaged over an area big enough including continent boundaries those type of regions could be considered zones of divergence or net sources this location showed also higher values for the continental evaporation recycling ratio evaporated moisture falls as precipitation over the continent as pointed out by van der ent et al 2010 the fc suffers higher processes of recycling from the vertically integrated moisture flux vimf vectors and its divergence shaded it is also possible visualise the moisture transport under an eulerian perspective the vimf fields could be useful in some interpretations about forward analyses using the lagrangian approach fig 1c illustrates the vimf during the wet season the anticyclonic motion over the southern arabian peninsula associated with the arabian anticyclone contributed to moisture transport from the red and arabian seas with intense red colours implying divergence to the fc in concordance with de vries et al 2013 the presence of the mountains surrounding the fc means that the prevailing westerly winds during the wet season flow over the mountain ranges causing precipitation over the eastern and northern parts of the fc regions of convergence blue colours of the vimf evans et al 2004 the mesoscale convective systems and orographic precipitations are the main contributing factor for the precipitation al zuhairi et al 2016 trigo et al 2010 the vertical velocity at 500 hpa fig 1d shaded shows that upward motion negative vertical velocity in blue prevails over the fc and the north of the arabian peninsula accompanied by a 500 hpa trough over the eastern mediterranean fig 1d red dashed lines the ascending motion provides the opportunity for the generation of clouds over the fc together with consequent rainfall the 1980 2014 monthly means of the e p 0 integrated over the fc sources during the wet season are shown in fig 2 specifying the quantity of moisture that was evaporated from each source the highest moisture uptakes by the air masses tracked to the fc occurred over the eastern mediterranean blue bars during nearly the entire wet season except in april and may when the fc orange bars appeared as the major source recycling processes another important large scale source was the red sea red bars which showed its maximum contribution in october and november during these months the persian gulf uptakes similar moisture as the red sea the central mediterranean also showed higher relative evaporation to analyse the changes in the moisture sources during precipitation episodes over the fc we also calculated the positive values of the e p from the backward run for only rainy days during the wet season for 1996 2014 following the method explained in section 2 1 fig 3 a on rainy days the main sources e p 0 were located over the eastern fc the eastern mediterranean e p 0 3 mm day 1 and over the persian gulf the difference between the rainy days and non rainy days is shown in fig 3b negative values appeared over the north eastern mediterranean and the northern adjacent land areas of the fc indicating a reduction in the moisture uptake by air masses over these regions during rainy days importantly there is an absence of contribution to the moisture that reaches the fc from the caspian and black seas during rainy days at the same time there was an intensification of the moisture uptake for the sources over the southern parts of the fc itself and south eastern mediterranean the red and arabian seas and the persian gulf also contributed more moisture for the rainy days associated with the intensification of the arabian anticyclone de vries et al 2013 evans and smith 2006 using the same lagrangian method as presented in this work showed that despite most precipitation events in the fc resulting from moisture fluxes from the mediterranean sea southern fluxes from the red sea and the persian gulf can lead to the largest precipitation events because a significant amount of water vapour can be transported into the fc through the formation of a mountain barrier jet to the west of the zagros mountains any change in the sources of moisture may therefore have a clear effect on the fresh water in the fc region as in evans and alsamawi 2011 and the precipitation over it 4 2 moisture losses over the fc from particles transported from the selected sources to estimate the moisture loss e p 0 from the air masses to the atmosphere over the fc associated with each moisture source region a forward tracking was applied to the particles originating from each source region fig 4 a shows the relative importance in percentage of the total moisture loss of each source by month the moisture losses over the fc by particles coming from the fc itself eastern mediterranean and the red sea were dominant during all months of the wet season together reaching more than the 60 during all months the red sea significantly contributed to precipitation particularly during october december and april and the recycling contribution was highlighted during may fc source of moisture the moisture loss over the fc from trajectories coming from the persian gulf source was also slightly higher from october december and during may april and the contribution of the arabian sea increased in october november the percentage of moisture loss for the trajectories coming from the caspian and the black sea to the total losses reached its maximum in may fig 4b shows the relative importance of each source in percentage of the total moisture loss over the entire wet season we can see that the fc had the highest contribution recycling contribution followed by the eastern mediterranean and the red sea all about 20 arabian sea and persian gulf moisture sources contributed with 11 and 9 respectively the caspian sea exhibited the lowest contribution to the fc supporting 2 due to the complex nature of the fc region s location and topography each source of moisture may influence particular parts of the area during the wet season fig 5 shows the moisture loss e p 0 from each source over the fc this figure shows the regional contribution of each moisture source with a previously unpublished level of detail in summary these new findings suggest that the contributions to the fc from the source particles considered were concentrated in the northern and eastern parts of the fc these are areas where precipitation is higher due to orographic effects and the conjunction of the meteorological parameters described in the introduction of the paper the moisture loss from the particles identified as originating from the fc itself and from the eastern mediterranean were concentrated in the northern part of the region in the headwaters of the tigris river particles from the red and arabian seas and the persian gulf sources provided moisture to almost all of the fc but with a decreasing east west gradient being that the red sea was the most active source for precipitation over the south eastern part of the fc the higher values of the e p 0 over the east of the fc are to a large extent due to the westerlies and south westerlies that carry moisture from the red sea see fig 1c the moisture losses related to the western mediterranean and central mediterranean occurred over the northern and central regions in the fc the stationary cyclones created over certain regions such as cyprus lows which bring considerable precipitation to the eastern parts of the fc by moving eastwards these disturbances became semi stationary over the north of iraq where they are supplied by moist air from the gulf in the south and cause precipitation over the zagros mountains barlow et al 2016 beaumont et al 1988 the particles from the caspian sea provided no significant contribution to the moisture over large areas of the fc 5 changes in moisture transport from the sources into the fc during the 1998 2000 and 2007 2009 drought periods the drought episodes identified via spei at different time scales 1 3 6 12 and 24 months during the period from 1980 to 2014 were particularly evident after 1998 as shown in fig 6 the severe droughts 1 99 spei 1 5 of 1998 2000 and 2007 2009 specified by black rectangles were analysed some overlapping was evident for the episodes identified by shorter spei 1 3 6 and longer timescales spei 12 and 24 throughout the events clearly these events were more severe and lasted longer than other events identified for the period from 1980 to 2014 the last event 2007 2009 was the driest period in the instrumental record mathbout et al 2018 with noticeable social and political implications resulting gleick 2014 kelley et al 2015 according to spei 24 last panel in fig 6 the events lasted for 4 and 7 years with minimum spei values of 2 41 and 1 87 respectively which correspond to return periods of 125 and 32 5 years this result illustrates the very extreme dry conditions that characterized these two drought episodes fig 7 shows the occurrence percentage of the different drought categories mild normal severe and extreme during the wet seasons of the two drought episodes compared to the period from 1980 to 2014 420 months at the different spei timescales in general 60 of the monthly values were classified as severe according to the shorter spei timescales 1 3 and 6 months and this percentage increased to about 80 using the 12 and 24 months timescales given the reinforcement of the drought conditions considering longer cumulative periods the percentage of extreme values spei 2 ranged from 40 spei 12 to 85 spei 6 5 1 1998 2000 drought episode fig 8 shows the spatial distribution of the precipitation anomaly using monthly data from the cru with a spatial resolution of 0 5 over the fc for both wet seasons in the drought episode of 1998 2000 compared to the 1980 2014 wet season climatology a precipitation rate deficit can be seen over most of the fc for both wet seasons with the highest deficit less than 0 5 mm day 1 concentrated in the northern part however this extended with more intensity further south during 1998 1999 than during 1999 2000 in fact during 1998 1999 the decline in precipitation was 0 40 mm day and for 1999 2000 was 0 37 mm day representing the second and the third precipitation deficit record year during the entire analysis period the aim of this work was to find the relationship between the most intense droughts in the fc during its wet period and the lack of moisture supported by its sources a similar methodology to link the measure of droughts using spei and the sources of moisture for a particular region was used over the mediterranean area by drumond et al 2011 and 2017 or over one of its multiple sinks by stojanovic et al 2017 for the danube river basin with this purpose fig 9 shows the moisture loss anomalies from the nine different sources e p 0 over the fc during the two wet seasons of the drought episode of 1998 2000 it can be seen that moisture losses from the fc and eastern mediterranean decreased in the northern regions of the fc the area of their climatological influence fig 5 the contribution of moisture from the red sea persian gulf and arabian sea decreased over most of the fc region in both wet seasons with a similar pattern with more influence over the south eastern part and the red sea exhibited higher anomalous values during 1999 2000 in general the other sources of moisture showed positive contribution anomalies only the central mediterranean showed a slight deficit over the north north eastern areas but they were not the major moisture sources see fig 4 fig 10 shows the percentage of the anomalies in the precipitation pre blue dots evapotranspiration pet green triangles and omega field at 500 hpa pink crosses patterns and the accumulated anomalies over the fc from each source of moisture coloured bars this episode was characterized by a deficit in the precipitation pre over the fc during both wet seasons with higher anomalies during 1998 1999 reaching a deficit of 40 climatologically there is a broad area of ascending motion to the west of the zagros mountain during the wet season and orographic precipitation occurred evans et al 2004 however during the analysed events the area over the fc showed negative anomalies in the omega field at 500 hpa pink crosses most evident during 1999 2000 revealing the higher predominance of a downward motion which was consistent with the negative precipitation anomalies detected the absence of precipitation contributed to a positive contribution of evapotranspiration pet green triangles the rate of the surplus of pet in the second year 1999 2000 was less than the first the colour bars in fig 10 show the percentage of the explained moisture loss anomalies associated with each source during each wet seasons of the episode in 1998 1999 there was a decline in the loss of moisture from all sources with the major contribution to the drought coming from the eastern mediterranean followed by the fc and red sea and the arabian sea was the fourth source in importance during the following drought year 1999 2000 the deficit in the moisture losses from the majority of the sources persisted but it is important to note that the eastern mediterranean showed a positive contribution this result seems to be compensated by the higher decline due to the red sea source and the higher anomaly in the omega field 5 2 2007 2009 drought episode fig 11 shows the predominance of a precipitation deficit during the wet seasons of the 2007 2009 event during the wet season of 2007 2008 fig 11a the strongest decline in precipitation occurred in the northern east and western regions of the fc in the following season 2008 2009 fig 11b the strongest decline was confined to a small area in the north eastern fc the decline total was 0 47 mm day during 2007 2008 which is the highest precipitation loss detected from 1980 to 2014 and 0 26 mm day during 2008 2009 the fourth position with negative anomalies the pattern of the moisture anomalies related to each source during this episode fig 12 is very similar to the 2007 2008 and 2008 2009 wet seasons fig 13 also shows the same pattern for the results of the seasonal accumulated moisture deficit percentages during 2007 2008 all the sources supported a negative contribution over the fc with the exception of the eastern mediterranean regardless it is evident from fig 12 that it produced a negative support over the northern areas the most intense decline came from the fc itself followed by the red sea arabian sea and persian gulf sources during the following winter of 2008 2009 the negative precipitation anomalies decreased although the negative anomalous contribution from the fc itself was similar to the computed contribution during the previous wet season there was an intensification of the eastern mediterranean contribution reaching 40 as well as of the black sea the anomalous omega and pet patterns weakened and the pet anomalies became slightly negative 6 conclusions a lagrangian approach using flexpart was applied with era interim data to identify the main climatological sources of moisture over the fc during the wet season october may from 1980 to 2014 we analysed the changes in moisture transport from these sources during two intense drought episodes 1998 2000 and 2007 2009 the main conclusions of the study are summarised as 1 for the first time nine moisture sources e p 0 for the fc were identified in the target area the fc itself indicating the importance of the recycling over the region the mediterranean sea eastern mediterranean central mediterranean and western mediterranean the red arabian caspian and black seas and the persian gulf 2 the fc eastern mediterranean and the red sea were the most effective regions in terms of supplying moisture to the atmosphere over the fc 3 the highest moisture losses over the fc resulted from those air masses originating from the target region itself 20 followed by the eastern mediterranean and the red sea 20 and the arabian sea 11 sources 4 most of the moisture losses concentrated in the northern and eastern parts of the fc are a result of orographic forcing 5 spei analysis demonstrated that the drought events of 1998 2000 and 2007 2009 were associated with extreme drought conditions 6 in both drought episodes the highest precipitation deficit was concentrated in the northern part of the fc the decline in precipitation in both episodes intensified during the first wet season in each case and this deficit continued into the following season but with lower intensity anomalous subsidence prevailed during both episodes 7 during the episode of 1998 2000 the deficit in the moisture loss over the fc was mainly due to a decline of the moisture support from the fc itself eastern mediterranean red gulf and arabian seas followed by the central mediterranean the negative anomalies were concentrated in the northern and eastern parts of the fc 8 during the episode of 2007 2009 the deficit in moisture loss was higher during the first season of the period in comparison with the 1998 2000 episode for all sources except for the eastern mediterranean which had a positive contribution during both seasons again the highest deficit in the moisture losses were concentrated in the northern and eastern parts of the fc during both seasons 9 the deficit in the moisture losses related to the fc red and arabian seas and the persian gulf and the lack of convection conditions were the most remarkable common elements between the first seasons of both drought episodes during the drought episode of 2007 2009 a weakening of the anomalous patterns of precipitation evapotranspiration and omega were observed associated with a particular increase in the moisture contribution from the eastern mediterranean 10 the decline in precipitation was more extreme during 2007 2008 following by both seasonal periods of 1998 2000 adding all contributions the decline in moisture losses from the different air masses was more evident for all sources too especially during the first wet season of the episode 11 spei 12 and spei 24 analysis revealed that drought conditions began with the 1998 2000 event while the 2007 2009 episode was part of longer term drought conditions that developed during the previous months acknowledgements ad acknowledges the support of the spanish government and

7350,the fertile crescent fc region comprises the east coast of the mediterranean sea and the northern part of the arabian peninsula the fc suffered two severe drought episodes separated by a 7 year period in 1998 2000 and 2007 2009 which are considered the most severe episodes to hit the region in the last 50 years a lagrangian model flexpart and era interim data with a 1 1 lat long resolution were used to identify for the first time the climatological sources of moisture for the fc and their characteristics variability and the source receptor relationships concerning their contribution to the precipitation and the implications regarding the transport of moisture changes over the fc during the wet season october may from 1980 to 2014 were analysed the main climatological moisture sources during this period were determined to be the fc itself the eastern mediterranean sea the red sea the persian gulf the arabian sea the caspian and black seas and the central and western parts of the mediterranean sea the analysis showed higher anomalous conditions in the moisture transport from some moisture sources during the two outstanding drought episodes the key feature of the wet seasons during these episodes was a deficit in the moisture losses over the studied area related to the fc itself the red and arabian seas sources followed and to a lesser extent by the eastern mediterranean sea over the northern part of the fc region nevertheless the moisture supply deficit from the sources was much greater during the 2007 2009 drought event the spei index at large scales 24 months showed that the 2007 2009 episode was part of longer term drought conditions that had been developing over the previous months reinforcing the drought severity given recycling processes attributed to the fc during the two extreme drought episodes the mountainous terrain over the northern and eastern fc suffered the highest precipitation deficits and these areas are precisely the most influenced by two of the major moisture sources namely the fc and eastern mediterranean sea the decreased moisture contribution from these main sources led to more intense droughts over the region as a result both regions should be considered as hotspots to signal severe or extreme droughts in the region keywords fertile crescent drought episodes moisture budget lagrangian analysis spei 1 introduction being prone to severe droughts together with a range of complex socio economic impacts barlow et al 2016 hoerling et al 2012 hemming et al 2010 giorgi and lionello 2008 the middle east generally experiences severe water stresses el kenawy et al 2016 and is a known climate change hotspot giorgi 2006 some parts of the middle east have experienced a severe reduction in water resources during the last decades particularly during the periods from 1998 to 2000 and 2007 2009 in the culturally rich fertile crescent fc region the fc regions includes syria iraq jordan lebanon palestine israel a small strip of southern turkey and western parts of iran marsh and alagona 2016 during the drought years from 1998 to 2000 and 2007 2009 the fc region suffered its most intense and prolonged droughts since 1940 trigo et al 2010 severe effects were experienced in the affected countries in terms of agricultural production rural livelihoods migration urban economic base and ecosystem decline erian et al 2012 unisdr 2011 while a lack of precipitation is considered the main factor contributing to drought occurrence other factors can also cause or enhance droughts such as more intense but less frequent precipitation or excessive evapotranspiration over different time periods and spatial extents e g dai 2011 vicente serrano et al 2012 kelley et al 2015 highlighted some of these factors which together made the drought episode of 2007 2009 the worst experienced by the fc in recent years among other factors these authors stressed that above normal air temperatures dominated the years leading up to 2007 which increased evaporation and led to reduced soil moisture groundwater and streamflow that consequentially worsened the severity of the drought kelley et al 2015 droughts are defined as prolonged periods of abnormally dry weather resulting in water shortages that can lead to serious hydrological imbalances in the affected areas glickman 2000 because of the complex nature of droughts it is difficult to achieve a comprehensive theory that fully explains the generation of these events liu et al 2004 it is therefore important to study the mechanisms responsible for the decline of precipitation over the sinks or any decrease in evaporation from the sources or both that form the dominant trigger of a drought over a region or intensify it a general relationship between source moisture transport deficits and droughts was hypothesized in the review article by gimeno et al 2012 and dirmeyer et al 2014 found significant changes in evaporative moisture during times of drought over the last two decades there have been several studies which assessed this relationship for droughts in specific regions example studies include the 2012 drought in the iberian peninsula by peterson et al 2013 the 2012 and 1998 great plains droughts by drumond et al 2016 weaver et al 2009 and dirmeyer and brubaker 1999 droughts in china by liu et al 2017 and drumond et al 2012 and droughts in africa as presented by d abreton and tyson 1995 and sorí et al 2017 to better understand the links between source moisture transport deficits and droughts the inclusion of a wide quantity of study areas could improve our knowledge of the physical processes leading to the formation and persistence of droughts over different regions kam et al 2014 liu et al 2004 the resulting knowledge could provide information about more appropriate uses of water resources during these extreme hazard events with regard to moisture transport over the mediterranean several studies have investigated this topic using different methodologies across the region as a whole e g mariotti et al 2002 nieto et al 2010 schicker et al 2010 gómez hernández et al 2013 or in specific regions such as southern europe e g fernandez et al 2003 gimeno et al 2010 sahel e g nieto et al 2006 salih et al 2015 and the ethiopian highlands e g viste and sorteberg 2012 2013 tubi et al 2017 investigated moisture transport by tropical plumes over the middle east and identified two main moisture pathways one originating in tropical west africa and another that emanates from east to central africa however to our knowledge this research topic has not been fully explored for the fc region therefore the main goals of the present study were to identify the main sources of atmospheric moisture over the fc during the wet season october to may using the lagrangian method developed by stohl and james 2004 2005 and to study the characteristics of these sources during the two severe drought episodes from 1998 to 2000 and 2007 2009 to these ends we tracked air masses from the fc backward in time to detect the regions where moisture uptake by the air masses reached the target region we then forward tracked the particles originating from these sources to investigate how they lost moisture within the atmospheric column over the fc the paper is organized as follows the description of the data the identification of the drought episodes the lagrangian method and the experiments are presented in section 2 a detailed characterisation of the moisture sources and their temporal variability are given in section 3 in section 4 we described and analysed anomalies in the moisture sources during the two severe drought episodes that occurred in the fc our overall conclusions are provided in section 5 2 data and methods this study was based on the method developed by stohl and james 2004 2005 which used the flexpart v9 0 lagrangian particle dispersion model with european reanalysis era interim reanalysis data dee et al 2011 to track changes in atmospheric moisture along air mass trajectories nieto et al 2008 drumond et al 2008 gimeno et al 2013 drumond et al 2014 2016 2 1 lagrangian methodology in the lagrangian approach the atmosphere is divided homogeneously into a large number of finite elements hereafter particles with constant mass m stohl and james 2004 these particles are advected using a three dimensional wind dataset two horizontal dimensions and one vertical and superimposed with stochastic turbulence and convective motions changes in the specific moisture q of each particle with time e p m dq dt where m is the mass of the particle represents the increases through evaporation e and decreases through precipitation p in moisture along the trajectories this method may be run backward or forward in time and allows for the identification of the sources and sinks of the moisture for the air particles that enter or leave a predefined region through the calculation of dq dt along the path of each particle both the locations of these particles and q are recorded every 6 h by adding e p for all the tracked particles observed in the atmospheric column over a given area we obtain the surface freshwater flux e p where e denotes the evaporation rate and p denotes the precipitation rate per unit area in the e p two dimensional maps the sources are identified by positive values of e p which characterise those areas where evaporation dominates the precipitation in the freshwater budget sinks on the other hand are those areas where air particles lose moisture to the environment and they are characterized by negative values of e p where precipitation dominates evaporation a complete description of the method and its limitations are discussed by stohl and james 2004 2005 the method is mostly limited by the use of a time derivative for the humidity in which numerical errors associated with the temporal variations in the moisture present in a particle can be taken as the moisture fluxes stohl and james 2004 therefore the success of this method strongly depends on the accuracy of the meteorological input data gimeno et al 2012 however given that there are a large number of particles in an atmospheric column any errors may cancel each other stohl and james 2004 an additional limitation of this approach is that only the net moisture gained or lost by the tracked air mass can be calculated but not the evaporation or precipitation individually another source of uncertainty is derived from the assumption that every particle has constant mass whereas the mass of the real atmosphere changes through the gain or loss of moisture stohl and james 2004 regardless this lagrangian approach has been used worldwide during the last decades in a paper by gimeno et al 2012 the advantages and disadvantages of the method was reviewed and compared with other methods such as eulerian methods box models or isotopes analyses between the models it is remarkable that the lagrangian method is only one that allows the position of the moisture sources to be defined with a higher precision the flexpart data set used in this study was the output of a global simulation in which the entire global atmosphere was divided into approximately 2 0 million particles with a 10 day tracking period which represents the average residence time of water vapour in the atmosphere numaguti 1999 the tracks were computed using the era interim reanalysis data available at 6 h intervals from 1980 to 2014 at a resolution of 1 x1 with 61 vertical levels from 1000 to 0 1 hpa the era interim data may be considered the state of art reanalysis in terms of the hydrological cycle trenberth et al 2011 in comparison with other data sets and lorenz and kunstmann 2012 demonstrated that currently the reanalysis data gives the most reasonable agreement between observational datasets and the atmospheric and terrestrial water balance here we analysed the e p values integrated over the 10 day tracking period using a backward analysis it was possible to identify the moisture sources of the air particles that reached the fc which are those regions where the air particles gain moisture as they travel towards the target area it is important to recall that climatological moisture sources defined through the backward analysis take into account the identification of all air particles that reach the fc independently of the associated gains losses of moisture over the target area using the output data of the global experiment all air particles over the fc were identified daily during the wet season from october may for the period from 1980 to 2014 and even non precipitating particles were tracked backward the spatial domain of the major moisture sources for the fc were determined using the percentile method drumond et al 2014 applied over the average of the e p 0 for the wet season during 1980 2014 a complete description of the identification of the sources is provided in section 3 1 an additional backward experiment was carried out to identify which of the major selected sources intensified during rainfall episodes over the fc to this end we applied a backward analysis but only for the rainy days as defined using the method of raziei et al 2012 as those days when at least 10 of all the grid points in the domain of interest in the fc 59 grid points in this case received precipitation totals 5 mm these criteria were used to exclude rainfall generated by local convection or orographic mechanisms and to eliminate days with the lowest precipitation amounts raziei et al 2012 rainy days were selected during the wet season using the daily mean precipitation dataset obtained from the global precipitation climatological project database gpcp in version 1 2 at a grid of 1 in latitude and longitude available at http precip gsfc nasa gov available only for the years 1996 2014 bolvin 2009 once the major sources of moisture had been detected a forward analysis allowed the identification of moisture sinks for air particles leaving each source of the fc the purpose was to estimate the moisture lost by the air masses to the atmosphere over the fc and to determine which areas inside the fc were more affected by moisture transport from the different sources 2 2 the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei the relative importance of the two drought episodes of interest in comparison with the remainder of events occurring from 1980 to 2014 in the fc was evaluated using the standardised precipitation evapotranspiration index spei this is an index based on climatic water balance i e the difference between precipitation pre and the atmospheric evaporative demand vicente serrano et al 2010 usually accounted for by means of the potential evapotranspiration pet this index is equally sensitive to changes in the precipitation and the pet and it works as a pure climate balance in which as a difference of the palmer drought severity index the precipitation and the pet have the same weight in the index values vicente serrano et al 2015 therefore the spei is more sensitive to evaporative demand than other commonly used droughts indices during droughts in arid and semi arid regions cook et al 2014 tao et al 2014 törnros and menzel 2014 such as the fc at the same time the calculation is simple and can be calculated on different time scales the time scale term is essential for understanding drought occurrences and severity edwards and mckee 1997 it refers to the different cumulative times of the meteorological variables pre and pet used to calculate the index this is advantageous because different hydrological agricultural and environmental systems and regions can respond to drought conditions on very different time scales vicente serrano and lópez moreno 2005 vicente serrano et al 2012 2013 lópez moreno et al 2013 ji and peters 2003 the spei was computed using the monthly climatic research unit cru ts3 23 climate dataset harris et al 2014 available online at https crudata uea ac uk cru data hrg cru ts 3 23 with a spatial resolution of 0 5 the drought episodes were identified for different spei timescales namely a short timescales 1 3 and 6 months which usually relate to soil moisture deficits e g scaini et al 2015 b moderate timescales 12 months relating to streamflow deficits e g lópez moreno et al 2013 and c long timescales 24 months which relate to groundwater level deficits potop et al 2014 ye et al 2015 the monthly values of the spei were classified according to severity into four categories mild 0 99 spei 0 normal 1 49 spei 1 severe 1 99 spei 1 5 or extreme spei 2 using the spei we can specify the onset and the end of a drought episode which begins when the spei value first falls below zero followed by a value of 1 or less and ends when the spei returns to a positive value mckee et al 1993 tan et al 2015 3 fertile crescent climatology overview in terms of temperature and precipitation the fc is classified as an arid to semi arid region with cool and wet winters from october may wet season and hot and dry summers from june september dry season the fc has a strong precipitation gradient from the wet mountain areas located in the north and northeast taurus and zagros mountains respectively reaching 1000 mm to a very dry regime in the south near the arabian desert where the precipitation amount does not exceed 200 mm rainfall mostly occurs during the wet season with a maximum in december february while the summer months are considered practically dry trigo et al 2010 precipitation over the fc is mostly produced from three systems cyclonic disturbance over the mediterranean convective precipitation created via strong convective instability given sufficient water vapour and orographic rainfall evans et al 2004 in this context the role played by mesoscale convective systems are relevant because they contribute to 70 to the rainfall al zuhairi et al 2016 in the wet season the fc is influenced by two broad groups of storm tracks created over the mediterranean both bringing considerable precipitation to the region in the first storm track group waves move rapidly in the upper troposphere that cross the area between southern turkey and jordan the maximum precipitation associated with these disturbances occurs during winter in syria jordan and over the zagros mountains the second storm track group contains stationary cyclones moving eastwards that become semi stationary over the north of iraq where they are supplied by moist air from the persian gulf in the south and as consequence they also cause precipitation over the zagros mountains as the season progresses into spring the low systems move further north and their effects over the fc decrease barlow et al 2016 beaumont et al 1988 another system that affects the climatology in this region is the red sea trough rst it is a low level pressure trough extending from the african monsoon trough over equatorial africa passing over the red sea towards the eastern mediterranean el fandy 1948 playing a crucial role in transferring moisture from the tropics to the fc from autumn to spring tsvieli and zangvil 2005 when the rst coincides with extratropical cyclones coming from the mediterranean unstable conditions can develop and flooding can occur therefore in this case it is referred to as being active krichak et al 2012 evans and smith 2006 showed that despite most precipitation events in the fc resulting from moisture fluxes from the mediterranean sea southern fluxes from the red sea and the persian gulf can lead to the largest precipitation events because a significant amount of water vapour can be transported into the fc by the formation of a mountain barrier jet to the west of the zagros mountains any change in these southern fluxes may therefore have a clear effect on the fresh water deposited in the fc region evans and alsamawi 2011 orographic precipitation dominates the mountain chains surrounding the area when sufficient amounts of water vapour reach this area and rise over the slopes trigo et al 2010 although precipitation is lower during summer months june september the greatest amounts of water vapour occurs over the region during this time due to the surplus of moisture and higher temperatures that accompany the expansion of the indian monsoon that covers most of the middle east the rainfall deficit is attributed to the absence of dynamic factors that favour the upward motion necessary for rainfall in fact a downward motion or subsidence occurs over the fc because of a cell circulation created by increasing temperatures over the iranian plateau leading to an ascending flow and a descending flow over the western side of the zagros mountains this configuration also causes the westerlies to recurve parallel to the mountains flowing to the southeast rather than rising over them as in winter evans et al 2004 4 characterization of the moisture sources and their temporal variability 4 1 determination of the moisture sources for the fc and an estimation of the arriving air masses moisture gains the fc is characterized by a strong precipitation gradient from the wet mountain regimes located along the mediterranean coastal mountain ranges in the west from the taurus mountains in the north and from the zagros mountains in the east to a very dry regime in the southern regions adjacent to the arabian desert the rainfall mostly occurs from october may wet season with a maximum occurring in december january and february while june september is considered the dry season trigo et al 2010 the detection of the moisture sources e p 0 using the lagrangian approach described has been applied for first time to the fc area with this study focusing on the wet season october may for 1980 2014 different percentiles were applied with the purpose of identifying areas presenting the highest net uptake of atmospheric moisture associated with air masses traveling towards the fc following the same demarcations as trigo et al 2010 the fc region in this work is defined as the orange area in fig 1 b fig 1a shows the mean climatological values of the e p 0 obtained via a backward experiment over the fc for the wet season during the 10 days of analysed trajectories the percentile values of the contour lines were plotted and table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the nine selected sources eight maritime sources and the fc itself applying the different percentiles thresholds 0 90 0 96 0 98 and 0 99 over the obtained e p 0 field from fig 1a is it possible to observe that a large area extending from the eastern mediterranean region towards the persian gulf acts as the major moisture source for the fc 0 99 percentile contour 0 1 mm day to include the maximum number of sources the maritime sources were all delimited by the 0 90 percentile 0 004 mm day these sources included the red sea the persian gulf the gulf of oman the arabian sea the caspian and the black seas and the complete mediterranean sea we considered the central and western mediterranean sources separately as they showed areas with higher values of e p 0 reaching the 0 98 percentile 0 04 mm day in fact they display different patterns of circulation in the area because the sicily island separates the sources and they are quite independent in terms of orographic injections recirculation and currents as described by millan et al 1997 2002 beside this previous studies of the mediterranean seas as sources of moisture used this same division nieto at al 2010 schicker et al 2010 the eastern mediterranean was delimited by the 0 99 percentile isoline in the maritime area and by the coastal line to the east the fc itself was also considered as a source of moisture fig 1b summarizes these sources schematically the importance of the mediterranean in providing moisture for precipitation processes over the middle east was mentioned by evans et al 2004 the fact that the fc itself is a source of moisture despite being an arid or semi arid region is in concordance with the paradox that deserts act as a net moisture source starr and peixoto 1958 pike 1970 deserts evaporate more moisture than they receive precipitation and shay el et al 1999 found that if the moisture flux divergence is averaged over an area big enough including continent boundaries those type of regions could be considered zones of divergence or net sources this location showed also higher values for the continental evaporation recycling ratio evaporated moisture falls as precipitation over the continent as pointed out by van der ent et al 2010 the fc suffers higher processes of recycling from the vertically integrated moisture flux vimf vectors and its divergence shaded it is also possible visualise the moisture transport under an eulerian perspective the vimf fields could be useful in some interpretations about forward analyses using the lagrangian approach fig 1c illustrates the vimf during the wet season the anticyclonic motion over the southern arabian peninsula associated with the arabian anticyclone contributed to moisture transport from the red and arabian seas with intense red colours implying divergence to the fc in concordance with de vries et al 2013 the presence of the mountains surrounding the fc means that the prevailing westerly winds during the wet season flow over the mountain ranges causing precipitation over the eastern and northern parts of the fc regions of convergence blue colours of the vimf evans et al 2004 the mesoscale convective systems and orographic precipitations are the main contributing factor for the precipitation al zuhairi et al 2016 trigo et al 2010 the vertical velocity at 500 hpa fig 1d shaded shows that upward motion negative vertical velocity in blue prevails over the fc and the north of the arabian peninsula accompanied by a 500 hpa trough over the eastern mediterranean fig 1d red dashed lines the ascending motion provides the opportunity for the generation of clouds over the fc together with consequent rainfall the 1980 2014 monthly means of the e p 0 integrated over the fc sources during the wet season are shown in fig 2 specifying the quantity of moisture that was evaporated from each source the highest moisture uptakes by the air masses tracked to the fc occurred over the eastern mediterranean blue bars during nearly the entire wet season except in april and may when the fc orange bars appeared as the major source recycling processes another important large scale source was the red sea red bars which showed its maximum contribution in october and november during these months the persian gulf uptakes similar moisture as the red sea the central mediterranean also showed higher relative evaporation to analyse the changes in the moisture sources during precipitation episodes over the fc we also calculated the positive values of the e p from the backward run for only rainy days during the wet season for 1996 2014 following the method explained in section 2 1 fig 3 a on rainy days the main sources e p 0 were located over the eastern fc the eastern mediterranean e p 0 3 mm day 1 and over the persian gulf the difference between the rainy days and non rainy days is shown in fig 3b negative values appeared over the north eastern mediterranean and the northern adjacent land areas of the fc indicating a reduction in the moisture uptake by air masses over these regions during rainy days importantly there is an absence of contribution to the moisture that reaches the fc from the caspian and black seas during rainy days at the same time there was an intensification of the moisture uptake for the sources over the southern parts of the fc itself and south eastern mediterranean the red and arabian seas and the persian gulf also contributed more moisture for the rainy days associated with the intensification of the arabian anticyclone de vries et al 2013 evans and smith 2006 using the same lagrangian method as presented in this work showed that despite most precipitation events in the fc resulting from moisture fluxes from the mediterranean sea southern fluxes from the red sea and the persian gulf can lead to the largest precipitation events because a significant amount of water vapour can be transported into the fc through the formation of a mountain barrier jet to the west of the zagros mountains any change in the sources of moisture may therefore have a clear effect on the fresh water in the fc region as in evans and alsamawi 2011 and the precipitation over it 4 2 moisture losses over the fc from particles transported from the selected sources to estimate the moisture loss e p 0 from the air masses to the atmosphere over the fc associated with each moisture source region a forward tracking was applied to the particles originating from each source region fig 4 a shows the relative importance in percentage of the total moisture loss of each source by month the moisture losses over the fc by particles coming from the fc itself eastern mediterranean and the red sea were dominant during all months of the wet season together reaching more than the 60 during all months the red sea significantly contributed to precipitation particularly during october december and april and the recycling contribution was highlighted during may fc source of moisture the moisture loss over the fc from trajectories coming from the persian gulf source was also slightly higher from october december and during may april and the contribution of the arabian sea increased in october november the percentage of moisture loss for the trajectories coming from the caspian and the black sea to the total losses reached its maximum in may fig 4b shows the relative importance of each source in percentage of the total moisture loss over the entire wet season we can see that the fc had the highest contribution recycling contribution followed by the eastern mediterranean and the red sea all about 20 arabian sea and persian gulf moisture sources contributed with 11 and 9 respectively the caspian sea exhibited the lowest contribution to the fc supporting 2 due to the complex nature of the fc region s location and topography each source of moisture may influence particular parts of the area during the wet season fig 5 shows the moisture loss e p 0 from each source over the fc this figure shows the regional contribution of each moisture source with a previously unpublished level of detail in summary these new findings suggest that the contributions to the fc from the source particles considered were concentrated in the northern and eastern parts of the fc these are areas where precipitation is higher due to orographic effects and the conjunction of the meteorological parameters described in the introduction of the paper the moisture loss from the particles identified as originating from the fc itself and from the eastern mediterranean were concentrated in the northern part of the region in the headwaters of the tigris river particles from the red and arabian seas and the persian gulf sources provided moisture to almost all of the fc but with a decreasing east west gradient being that the red sea was the most active source for precipitation over the south eastern part of the fc the higher values of the e p 0 over the east of the fc are to a large extent due to the westerlies and south westerlies that carry moisture from the red sea see fig 1c the moisture losses related to the western mediterranean and central mediterranean occurred over the northern and central regions in the fc the stationary cyclones created over certain regions such as cyprus lows which bring considerable precipitation to the eastern parts of the fc by moving eastwards these disturbances became semi stationary over the north of iraq where they are supplied by moist air from the gulf in the south and cause precipitation over the zagros mountains barlow et al 2016 beaumont et al 1988 the particles from the caspian sea provided no significant contribution to the moisture over large areas of the fc 5 changes in moisture transport from the sources into the fc during the 1998 2000 and 2007 2009 drought periods the drought episodes identified via spei at different time scales 1 3 6 12 and 24 months during the period from 1980 to 2014 were particularly evident after 1998 as shown in fig 6 the severe droughts 1 99 spei 1 5 of 1998 2000 and 2007 2009 specified by black rectangles were analysed some overlapping was evident for the episodes identified by shorter spei 1 3 6 and longer timescales spei 12 and 24 throughout the events clearly these events were more severe and lasted longer than other events identified for the period from 1980 to 2014 the last event 2007 2009 was the driest period in the instrumental record mathbout et al 2018 with noticeable social and political implications resulting gleick 2014 kelley et al 2015 according to spei 24 last panel in fig 6 the events lasted for 4 and 7 years with minimum spei values of 2 41 and 1 87 respectively which correspond to return periods of 125 and 32 5 years this result illustrates the very extreme dry conditions that characterized these two drought episodes fig 7 shows the occurrence percentage of the different drought categories mild normal severe and extreme during the wet seasons of the two drought episodes compared to the period from 1980 to 2014 420 months at the different spei timescales in general 60 of the monthly values were classified as severe according to the shorter spei timescales 1 3 and 6 months and this percentage increased to about 80 using the 12 and 24 months timescales given the reinforcement of the drought conditions considering longer cumulative periods the percentage of extreme values spei 2 ranged from 40 spei 12 to 85 spei 6 5 1 1998 2000 drought episode fig 8 shows the spatial distribution of the precipitation anomaly using monthly data from the cru with a spatial resolution of 0 5 over the fc for both wet seasons in the drought episode of 1998 2000 compared to the 1980 2014 wet season climatology a precipitation rate deficit can be seen over most of the fc for both wet seasons with the highest deficit less than 0 5 mm day 1 concentrated in the northern part however this extended with more intensity further south during 1998 1999 than during 1999 2000 in fact during 1998 1999 the decline in precipitation was 0 40 mm day and for 1999 2000 was 0 37 mm day representing the second and the third precipitation deficit record year during the entire analysis period the aim of this work was to find the relationship between the most intense droughts in the fc during its wet period and the lack of moisture supported by its sources a similar methodology to link the measure of droughts using spei and the sources of moisture for a particular region was used over the mediterranean area by drumond et al 2011 and 2017 or over one of its multiple sinks by stojanovic et al 2017 for the danube river basin with this purpose fig 9 shows the moisture loss anomalies from the nine different sources e p 0 over the fc during the two wet seasons of the drought episode of 1998 2000 it can be seen that moisture losses from the fc and eastern mediterranean decreased in the northern regions of the fc the area of their climatological influence fig 5 the contribution of moisture from the red sea persian gulf and arabian sea decreased over most of the fc region in both wet seasons with a similar pattern with more influence over the south eastern part and the red sea exhibited higher anomalous values during 1999 2000 in general the other sources of moisture showed positive contribution anomalies only the central mediterranean showed a slight deficit over the north north eastern areas but they were not the major moisture sources see fig 4 fig 10 shows the percentage of the anomalies in the precipitation pre blue dots evapotranspiration pet green triangles and omega field at 500 hpa pink crosses patterns and the accumulated anomalies over the fc from each source of moisture coloured bars this episode was characterized by a deficit in the precipitation pre over the fc during both wet seasons with higher anomalies during 1998 1999 reaching a deficit of 40 climatologically there is a broad area of ascending motion to the west of the zagros mountain during the wet season and orographic precipitation occurred evans et al 2004 however during the analysed events the area over the fc showed negative anomalies in the omega field at 500 hpa pink crosses most evident during 1999 2000 revealing the higher predominance of a downward motion which was consistent with the negative precipitation anomalies detected the absence of precipitation contributed to a positive contribution of evapotranspiration pet green triangles the rate of the surplus of pet in the second year 1999 2000 was less than the first the colour bars in fig 10 show the percentage of the explained moisture loss anomalies associated with each source during each wet seasons of the episode in 1998 1999 there was a decline in the loss of moisture from all sources with the major contribution to the drought coming from the eastern mediterranean followed by the fc and red sea and the arabian sea was the fourth source in importance during the following drought year 1999 2000 the deficit in the moisture losses from the majority of the sources persisted but it is important to note that the eastern mediterranean showed a positive contribution this result seems to be compensated by the higher decline due to the red sea source and the higher anomaly in the omega field 5 2 2007 2009 drought episode fig 11 shows the predominance of a precipitation deficit during the wet seasons of the 2007 2009 event during the wet season of 2007 2008 fig 11a the strongest decline in precipitation occurred in the northern east and western regions of the fc in the following season 2008 2009 fig 11b the strongest decline was confined to a small area in the north eastern fc the decline total was 0 47 mm day during 2007 2008 which is the highest precipitation loss detected from 1980 to 2014 and 0 26 mm day during 2008 2009 the fourth position with negative anomalies the pattern of the moisture anomalies related to each source during this episode fig 12 is very similar to the 2007 2008 and 2008 2009 wet seasons fig 13 also shows the same pattern for the results of the seasonal accumulated moisture deficit percentages during 2007 2008 all the sources supported a negative contribution over the fc with the exception of the eastern mediterranean regardless it is evident from fig 12 that it produced a negative support over the northern areas the most intense decline came from the fc itself followed by the red sea arabian sea and persian gulf sources during the following winter of 2008 2009 the negative precipitation anomalies decreased although the negative anomalous contribution from the fc itself was similar to the computed contribution during the previous wet season there was an intensification of the eastern mediterranean contribution reaching 40 as well as of the black sea the anomalous omega and pet patterns weakened and the pet anomalies became slightly negative 6 conclusions a lagrangian approach using flexpart was applied with era interim data to identify the main climatological sources of moisture over the fc during the wet season october may from 1980 to 2014 we analysed the changes in moisture transport from these sources during two intense drought episodes 1998 2000 and 2007 2009 the main conclusions of the study are summarised as 1 for the first time nine moisture sources e p 0 for the fc were identified in the target area the fc itself indicating the importance of the recycling over the region the mediterranean sea eastern mediterranean central mediterranean and western mediterranean the red arabian caspian and black seas and the persian gulf 2 the fc eastern mediterranean and the red sea were the most effective regions in terms of supplying moisture to the atmosphere over the fc 3 the highest moisture losses over the fc resulted from those air masses originating from the target region itself 20 followed by the eastern mediterranean and the red sea 20 and the arabian sea 11 sources 4 most of the moisture losses concentrated in the northern and eastern parts of the fc are a result of orographic forcing 5 spei analysis demonstrated that the drought events of 1998 2000 and 2007 2009 were associated with extreme drought conditions 6 in both drought episodes the highest precipitation deficit was concentrated in the northern part of the fc the decline in precipitation in both episodes intensified during the first wet season in each case and this deficit continued into the following season but with lower intensity anomalous subsidence prevailed during both episodes 7 during the episode of 1998 2000 the deficit in the moisture loss over the fc was mainly due to a decline of the moisture support from the fc itself eastern mediterranean red gulf and arabian seas followed by the central mediterranean the negative anomalies were concentrated in the northern and eastern parts of the fc 8 during the episode of 2007 2009 the deficit in moisture loss was higher during the first season of the period in comparison with the 1998 2000 episode for all sources except for the eastern mediterranean which had a positive contribution during both seasons again the highest deficit in the moisture losses were concentrated in the northern and eastern parts of the fc during both seasons 9 the deficit in the moisture losses related to the fc red and arabian seas and the persian gulf and the lack of convection conditions were the most remarkable common elements between the first seasons of both drought episodes during the drought episode of 2007 2009 a weakening of the anomalous patterns of precipitation evapotranspiration and omega were observed associated with a particular increase in the moisture contribution from the eastern mediterranean 10 the decline in precipitation was more extreme during 2007 2008 following by both seasonal periods of 1998 2000 adding all contributions the decline in moisture losses from the different air masses was more evident for all sources too especially during the first wet season of the episode 11 spei 12 and spei 24 analysis revealed that drought conditions began with the 1998 2000 event while the 2007 2009 episode was part of longer term drought conditions that developed during the previous months acknowledgements ad acknowledges the support of the spanish government and

stockholm sweden corresponding author this manuscript was handled by marco borga editor in chief with the assistance of yasuto tachikawa associate editor the upper blue nile basin is considered as the lifeline for 250 million people and contributes 50 gm3 year of water to the nile river poor land management practices in the ethiopian highlands have caused a significant amount of soil erosion thereby threatening the productivity of the ethiopian agricultural system degrading the health of the aquatic ecosystem and shortening the life of downstream reservoirs the upper blue nile basin because of limited research and availability of data has been considered as the great unknown in the recent past however more research has been published nonetheless there is no state of the art review that presents research achievements gaps and future directions hence this paper aims to bridge this gap by reviewing the advances in water resources research in the basin while highlighting research needs and future directions we report that there have been several research projects that try to understand the biogeochemical processes by collecting information on runoff groundwater recharge sediment transport and tracers different types of hydrological models have been applied most of the earlier research used simple conceptual and statistical approaches for trend analysis and water balance estimations mainly using rainfall and evapotranspiration data more recent research has been using advanced semi physically physically based distributed hydrological models using high resolution temporal and spatial data for diverse applications we identified several research gaps and provided recommendations to address them while we have witnessed advances in water resources research in the basin we also foresee opportunities for further advancement incorporating the research findings into policy and practice will significantly benefit the development and transformation agenda of the ethiopian government keywords upper blue nile basin ethiopia state of the art review water resources hydrological models 1 introduction the nile basin is shared by eleven riparian countries and is the lifeline for more than 238 million people living in the basin nbi 2012 the nile water has been crucial for upstream and downstream users with competing needs such as irrigation domestic water supply hydropower industry and other ecosystem services these competing needs are severely compromised by soil erosion in the upstream part of the basin e g in ethiopia and siltation of reservoirs and irrigation canals in the downstream part of the river reach e g in sudan and egypt climate and land use changes and poor land management are other biophysical challenges to the water resources in the basin hurni et al 2005 the nile proper is formed by two major tributaries the white nile and the blue nile the upper blue nile fig 1 originates from the ethiopian plateau and contributes 60 of the flow to the nile river at aswan egypt conway and hulme 1993 sutcliffe and parks 1999 based on long term observations 1912 2003 at the basin outlet in sudan the upper blue nile basin on average discharges 48 9 gm3 year of water tesemma et al 2010 until recently there has been very little published literature on the upper blue nile basin the first major study was the abay blue nile river basin integrated development master plan which was conducted between 1958 and 1963 by the united states bureau of reclamation usbr 1964 a follow up study was conducted by bceom a french engineering consultant to develop a master plan for the upper blue nile basin and other major river basins in ethiopia bceom 1998 because of limited published literature data scarcity and difficulty accessing available data the basin was described as the great unknown waterbury 1988 cited in conway 2000 however advances in hydrological science data collection methods and growing international and national interest in understanding the complex biophysical and socio economic issues have led to significant scientific output in the recent past models spanning from simple conceptual ones to ones that are more data intensive and fully distributed have been applied however most of the published research has been concentrated at the headwaters of the upper blue nile basin fig 1 there are also several studies that have been published using streamflow data at the outlet of the river at the sudan border fig 1 although there have been significant advances in water resources research in the basin the progress has not yet been documented in a consolidated manner this makes it difficult to know what has been achieved and what research gaps still remain a state of the art review will help to compile achievements in water resources research identify gaps and provide insights for future research in the basin the objectives of this paper are therefore to review the advances in the water resources research in the upper blue nile basin present research gaps stimulate discussion and provide recommendations for future research this review mainly focuses on biophysical water resources research literature that presents socio economic hydro political and institutional issues as well as similar subjects was not covered 2 data and process understanding 2 1 challenges in data acquisition and advancement a major research challenge in the upper blue nile basin is availability of long term hydro climatic data records of rainfall data started for addis ababa station in 1896 and for gore and gambela beginning in the first decade of the 1900s conway 2000 however records for other climate gauging stations began during the 1950s and 1960s after the ethiopian national meteorological services agency nmsa was established conway 2000 recording hydrological data for the upstream part of the upper blue nile basin started in 1923 for example hurst and phillips 1933 reported that records of lake tana outflow exist from 1923 to 1930 a concerted program of river flow data collection in ethiopia was started in 1956 after the establishment of the ethiopian water resources department abate 1994 cited in conway 2000 however most of the earlier data had coarse temporal resolutions fig 2 and data collection efforts were concentrated in the upper part of the basin moreover the data had substantial missing records e g conway 2000 similar to the temporal data the spatial data e g digital elevation model dem land use and soil used in the past research had coarse spatial resolution fig 2 nevertheless most of the past research used these coarse spatial and temporal resolution data conway 2000 1997 hurst and phillips 1933 johnson and curtis 1994 kebede et al 2006 mishra and hata 2006 although advances in improvement in temporal data resolution have been recorded there are also critical challenges with existing data acquisition techniques in the basin for example the spatial distribution of existing observational hydro meteorological networks is so sparse that most of the meteorological gauging stations are located in towns along the main roads haile 2010 tekleab et al 2015 placing meteorological gauges in such a manner will not properly capture spatial topographic features such as mountains since rainfall amounts are higher in mountainous areas placement of meteorological gauges in such a manner will distort hydrological estimates bayabil et al 2016 suggested that rainfall in monsoon climates which is common in the upper blue nile basin is likely to vary over short distances similarly studies found that rainfall in the ethiopian highlands including the upper blue nile basin significantly varies in space bewket and conway 2007 bitew et al 2010 bitew et al 2010 reported that daily rainfall between rain gauges showed an up to 424 coefficient of variation likewise most of the stream gauging stations do not have proper staff gauge representation upstream of small to medium tributary rivers except a few experimental watersheds fig 1 moreover modeling of sediment accumulation in the water bodies is limited by lack of historic sediment concentration data existing models simulate sediment concentration using data generated from sediment rating curves the rating curves are established based on sediment concentration measured during high flow seasons this often results in residual errors that are not uniformly distributed throughout the range of streamflow data adding to uncertainty in sediment modeling practices moreover water quality monitoring stations are almost nonexistent in the upper blue nile basin emama ligdi et al 2010 thus such data limitations may undermine efforts to understand the biophysical processes in the basin however we observed that recent advances in data acquisition in the upper blue nile basin have improved scientific exploration in the basin for example reanalysis data have helped to bridge the limitation of locally measured climate data dile and srinivasan 2014 presence of high resolution and real time satellite data helped to validate bias correct and downscale satellite data dinku et al 2008 duan and bastiaanssen 2013 habib et al 2014 validated satellite rainfall data in the upper blue nile basin include tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr multi sensor precipitation estimate geostationary mpeg and climate prediction center morphing cmorph worqlul et al 2014 advances in remote sensing technology also enabled the use of high resolution satellite data for land use change studies gebrehiwot et al 2014a kaba et al 2014 generated time series data of total suspended solids tss from remotely sensed images at one of the river mouths of lake tana the authors used the data to calibrate and validate the soil and water assessment tool swat model the results provide a scientific basis for using time series sediment concentration data generated from modis reflectance measurements in lieu of sediment data from rating curves despite significant advances in data acquisitions data quality issues are still significant and further research needs to be done to address the problem although data limitations have hampered research on process understanding and hydrological modeling to the extent that is required for sustainable water resources management there are several research works that attempt to explore biogeochemical processes in the basin process understanding and hydrological modeling research is also generating a significant amount of data that can be used for planning sustainable water resources management strategies in the basin 2 2 advances in process understanding through experimental studies biogeochemical processes in the ethiopian highlands are little understood different research programs undertook extensive field research to understand the biophysical processes in the upper blue nile basin the first program was the soil conservation research program scrp hurni 1988 institut and hurni 1982 the program collected rainfall runoff soil loss and crop yield data from six experimental watersheds in ethiopia and one watershed in eritrea this research contributed to understanding soil erosion and soil conservation in semi arid sub humid and humid areas of ethiopia grunder 1988 herweg and ludi 1999 based on the scrp field measured runoff and erosion data estimated that the soil and water conservation practices resulted soil loss changes between 100 and 37 while the impacts on runoff ranged between 95 and 65 the authors reported that soil loss and runoff decreased shortly after the implementation of the soil conservation interventions herweg and ludi 1999 however runoff and soil loss showed an increase with time because the recommended soil and water conservation interventions became ineffective population increased and land use changed hurni et al 2005 dagnew et al 2015 oostwoud wijdenes and bryan 2001 similarly guzman et al 2017 reported that soil and water conservation practices in the anjeni watershed in the upper blue nile basin were effective in reducing runoff and erosion only for five years after installation while after nine years the measures had almost no impact lack of proper maintenance of the soil and water conservation interventions may have contributed to their ineffectiveness recently a research program at bahir dar university in collaboration with cornell university has been collecting different relevant data to understand runoff generation processes in various watersheds in the ethiopian highlands e g tilahun et al 2016 2013 bayabil et al 2016 2015 2010 there is still disagreement regarding the nature of the runoff initiation mechanisms and their controlling factors in the upper blue nile basin while several reports from this program e g bayabil et al 2010 steenhuis et al 2009 tilahun et al 2014 highlight saturation excess as the dominant runoff generation mechanism in the ethiopian highlands other studies e g bewket and sterk 2005 conclude that the infiltration excess runoff mechanism was dominant applicability of the curve number cn method for estimating surface runoff was tested in three small watersheds in the lake tana basin by the stockholm environment institute sei and stockholm resilience center src dile et al 2016d this research showed that while the cn method was effective in estimating surface runoff during high intensity rainfall conditions it underestimated runoff from low intensity rainfall events the study concluded that the cn method is useful to estimate surface runoff for water management purposes it is worth mentioning that for water management applications high intensity rainfall events that generate large amounts of runoff are critically important because they fill reservoirs and ponds dile et al 2016c under the bahir dar university and cornell university research program extensive field measurements were conducted in five upland watersheds within the upper blue nile basin and one watershed in the awash basin to understand the physical processes underlying runoff and soil erosion liu et al 2008 tilahun et al 2013b bayabil 2017 2016 infiltration rate rainfall intensity shallow groundwater level sediment concentration and runoff were measured at the outlet and nested watersheds outlet in aweramba debre mawi enechilala anjeni andit tid and maybar for the first three watersheds aweramba debre mawi and enechilala field measurements have been available since 2012 while for the remaining three scrp watersheds data has been available since 1982 gully profiles were monitored in two watersheds debre mawi and enechilaila to estimate the gully soil loss before and after the rainy season ayele et al 2016 tebebu et al 2010 zegeye et al 2011 rill erosion measurements for various storm events during the rainy period was conducted in debre mawi watershed to estimate the soil loss by rill zegeye et al 2011 tilahun et al 2014 annual soil loss in the upland watersheds with active gullying reaches up to 400 t ha tebebu et al 2010 the annual soil loss contribution from rills was estimated at 60 t ha tilahun et al 2014 however the annual sediment yield at the outlet of the six watersheds ranged from 5 to 75 t ha ayele et al 2016 guzman et al 2013 the variations among the six watersheds are due to the availability of and differences in gullies in the upland watersheds tebebu et al 2015 on the other hand a study by bayabil et al 2017 indicated that erosion rates show significant variation owing to variations in measurement scale land management and the progression of the rainy season bayabil et al 2017 concluded that direct extrapolation of point plot and field scale erosion rates to catchment and basin scales and vice versa could be erroneous and misleading 2 3 advances in tracer data for understanding flow processes and nutrient transport recent research has started to use tracer data to understand the biogeochemical processes in the upper blue nile basin for example tekleab et al 2015 used field observation and stable isotope data to conceptualize hydrologic processes in two catchments chemoga and jedeb of the upper blue nile basin the isotope samples in precipitation spring water and streamflow were used to separate the runoff components and estimate mean residence times thereby characterizing the spatial and temporal variations of moisture fluxes the isotopic composition of precipitation exhibited marked seasonal variations which suggest that various sources of moisture generate rainfall in the choke mountains 4000 m a s l of the upper blue nile basin tekleab et al 2014b analysis of the isotope data indicated the dominance of event water which account an average of 71 and 64 of the total runoff during the wet season in the chemoga and jedeb catchments respectively the mean residence times of the stream water were 4 1 and 6 0 months for the whole chemoga and jedeb catchments respectively these observations suggest that saturation excess overland flow is the dominant runoff generation mechanism in the two studied catchments tekleab et al 2015 agricultural intensification and expansion is releasing non point source pollutants to the freshwater ecosystem in the upper blue nile basin in particular and ethiopia in general gebre mariam 2002 such pollutants are severely compromising the health of the riverine ecosystem for example anteneh 2014 reported that one third of the shoreline of lake tana is infested with water hyacinths a few studies have taken place recently that investigate non point source pollution of fresh water systems in the upper blue nile basin for example moges et al 2016 examined non point sources of phosphorus contribution in an agricultural watershed near lake tana they measured dissolved phosphorous concentration dpc in groundwater soil available phosphorous at three landscape positions discharge sediment and dpc at the outlet of the watershed this study highlighted that the major source of phosphorous is the saturated valley bottom alemu et al 2017 studied the concentration of dissolved phosphorus in lake tana and its tributaries from 2010 to 2012 and the rainy months of 2014 they reported that dissolved phosphorous concentration was higher in the rivers than in the lake they concluded that adsorption of phosphorous with the sediment and binding with metallic ions may be the causes of lower dissolved phosphorous concentration in the lake the dissolved phosphorous concentration was much higher during the rainy season than in the dry season alemu et al 2017 3 advances in statistical analysis and hydrological modeling statistical analysis and hydrological models are essential to understanding and predicting the spatial and temporal variability of water resources e g uhlenbrook et al 2004 previously the limitation of data availability and computational requirements limited study to the use of simple statistical and conceptual models conway 2000 kim and kaluarachchi 2008 2009 for example some of the conceptual models only used rainfall temperature and evapotranspiration to model the water balance of the upper blue nile basin conway 1997 however advances in availability of temporal and spatial data and computational power enabled application of state of the art hydrological models such as the soil and water assessment tool swat variable infiltration capacity vic hydrologiska byråns vattenbalansavdelning hvb water evaluation and planning system weap cropwat and indicators of hydrologic alterations iha among others 3 1 statistical analysis statistical analysis techniques have been widely employed in the upper blue nile basin to assess trends in hydrological variables and soil erosion for example tekleab et al 2013 applied mann kendall and pettitt tests to assess trends of three hydro meteorological variables stream flow temperature and precipitation represented by 9 12 and 13 gauging stations respectively within the upper blue nile basin the study indicated that temperature showed a statistically significant increasing trend while changes in mean annual and mean seasonal precipitation did not exhibit any statistically significant trends moreover stream flow did not show a consistent direction of statistically increasing or decreasing trends rather heterogeneous results were detected tesemma et al 2010 employed the mann kendall test and sen s t test to study trends in climate and hydrologic variables at three river gauging stations at bahir dar kessie and el diem at the sudan border for the 1964 2003 period the authors reported significant increases in discharge during the main rainy season june to september at all three stations while seasonal and annual basin wide average rainfall trends were not significant they found no significant trend in the observed annual runoff at el diem the annual discharge at kessie and bahir dar increased significantly by about 25 during the study period tesemma et al 2010 gebremicael et al 2013 used the mann kendall and pettitt tests to detect trends of sediment load 1980 2009 at the outlet of the upper blue nile basin at el diem station and reported significant increasing trends at a 5 confidence level mengistu et al 2014 studied spatial and temporal variability and trends of rainfall and mean maximum and minimum temperatures at seasonal and annual timescales for the upper blue nile basin using the least square method the authors reported that the northern central and southern parts of the basin experienced increasing trends of both mean annual maximum temperature and mean annual minimum temperature they also observed a statistically significant warming trend of mean annual minimum temperature in the southwestern parts of the basin moreover the same study showed an increasing albeit non significant annual rainfall trend in the upper blue nile basin on the other hand tabari et al 2015 reported decreasing though non significant trends in annual rainfall at most 80 of the 16 stations in the upper blue nile basin tabari et al 2015 used the modified mann kendall test and the sen s slope approach statistical analysis techniques have also been applied in the upper blue nile basin to assess step changes in hydrological variables due to biophysical changes in the watersheds gebrehiwot et al 2014b used the mann kendall statistical test to detect step changes in hydrological variables of 12 watersheds in the upper blue nile basin for a period of 45 years 1960 2004 this time period was split into three sub periods to represent the major political changes in ethiopia in 1975 and 1991 the hydrological variables included in the multivariate analyses were rainfall total flow high flow low flow low flow index and runoff coefficient gebrehiwot et al 2011 also applied multivariate statistical analysis on 32 meso scale 100 2000 km2 watersheds in the basin to study the relationship between different land cover and hydrological regimes using hydrology soil land use geology climate and topography data from 1960 to 1963 multivariate analysis was employed with the time series data between 1960 and 2005 of three rivers gilgel abay birr and upper didesa including studies on community perception and remote sensing analysis gebrehiwot 2015 the findings related to step changes due to land use change effects are highlighted under the land use change impacts in section 3 4 2 in addition to the common statistical tests such as mann kendell sen s and pettit that are widely used to detect trends and step changes taye and willems 2012 applied the quantile perturbation method qpm to study the temporal variability of rainfall and extreme high and low flows the qpm method is an empirical statistical analysis that examines temporal evaluation of trends and oscillation patterns of extremes taye and willems 2012 reported that high and low river flows and rainfall show a particular variation pattern and the extremes show significant decadal variations the extremes in the 1980s showed statistically significant negative anomalies compared to the long term reference period of 1964 2009 while the remaining period showed positive anomalies but with less statistical significance they suggested that changes that occur in the pacific ocean may contribute to the decadal oscillations in climate and related high and low flow availability in the upper blue nile the findings from taye and willems 2012 indicated that changes in hydroclimatic extremes were related to anthropogenic and natural processes for example they suggested that the increasing trend in recent years at the el diem gauging station is due to the construction of chera chera weir at the outlet of lake tana the decreasing trend at the gilgel abay gauging station is related to both water abstraction in the dry season for different purposes and land cover change cf bewket and sterk 2005 taye and willems 2012 also showed that oceanic influences can contribute to the variability in rainfall and flow extremes the presence of multi decadal oscillations in rainfall and streamflow extremes and volumes suggest that trend investigations should use long term data taye and willems 2012 3 2 advances in hydrological modeling for process understanding and catchment water balance several hydrological models have been applied in the upper blue nile basin to understand hydrological processes and estimate catchment water balance the earlier studies used simple conceptual models however more recent studies used advanced physically and semi physically based models for example conway 1997 developed a simple water balance model for the upper blue nile basin in this model vegetation cover was not explicitly considered and soil characteristics were spatially invariant the model was used to investigate spatial variability in the sensitivity of runoff to changes in rainfall and potential evaporation tekleab et al 2011 applied the budyko s hypothesis to understand the water balance relationships of the upper blue nile catchments from meso scale up to entire basin scale the budyko 1974 curve has potential to explore the long term annual water balance in the catchment based on hydro climatic factors the curve interprets the competition between the available water and available energy results showed that the curves enable first order functional classification of catchments in the upper blue nile basin catchments that exhibit different evaporation ratios were represented by different curves this could be attributed to variation in soil moisture storage capacity and annual runoff coefficient the budyko model is simple and parsimonious it can be applied in data scarce regions like the upper blue nile basin however development of the curves on the annual time scale lacks physical basis uhlenbrook et al 2010 applied the hvb model in the gilgel abay and koga watersheds of the upper blue nile basin with three modes of catchment representation i lumped ii lumped with multiple vegetation zones and iii semi distributed with multiple vegetation and elevation zones to analyze catchment behavior in these watersheds rientjes et al 2011 applied the hvb model to study the hydrological balance of lake tana in the upper blue nile basin they used the hvb model to regionalize parameters and estimate surface runoff generation from ungauged catchments collick et al 2009 developed a semi distributed water balance model based on the thornthwaite and mather 1955 model for the upper blue nile basin and its catchments as a tool for planning watershed management and conservation activities other studies e g steenhuis et al 2009 tesemma et al 2010 tilahun et al 2013a b used the same method to understand runoff processes in the scrp catchments and the upper blue nile at basin scale the parameter efficient distributed model ped a continuous daily simulation conceptual semi distributed hydrologic model was also developed based on the theory of simple thornthwaite and mather soil water balance models steenhuis and molen 1986 thornthwaite and mather 1955 ped is considered to be a parsimoniousmodel and requires minimum input data requiring only daily rainfall and long term average monthly potential evaporation it also requires observed flow for model calibration and validation by dividing the landscape into three areas periodically saturated areas degraded hill slopes and permeable hill slopes steenhuis et al 2009 several studies e g steenhuis et al 2009 tilahun et al 2013a b guzman et al 2017 applied ped in the entire upper blue nile basin and its watersheds to predict discharge and sediment they showed that this conceptual topography based model can reasonably describe the watershed hydrologic processes both hydrology and sediment in the monsoonal climate of ethiopia ped is suggested to be an efficient model in areas such as the upper blue nile basin where there is limited data steenhuis et al 2009 tilahun et al 2013a b guzman et al 2017 the jgrass newage system of hydrological forecasting and water resources modeling formetta et al 2014 was applied in the upper blue nile basin abera et al 2017 the jgrass newage is designed and implemented to simplify comparison and reproducibility of modeling solutions and results using a visualization system via udig based geographic information system and component based modeling systems formetta et al 2014 the latter is built on top of the object modeling system framework abera et al 2017 applied the jgrass newage model to estimate all the components of the hydrological cycle using sparsely available hydrometeorological data and satellite products abera et al 2017 verified the capability of the jgrass newage model to estimate streamflow using available observations from different gauging locations in the upper blue nile basin the authors concluded that the model could be used to forecast streamflow at ungauged locations with some success the model s capability to estimate storage the water contained in the surface soil snow and ice lakes and rivers and biomass and spatio temporal variability was verified using data from the basin scale grace twsc gravity recovery and climate experiment total water storage change which showed high correlation and similar amplitude with the jgrass newage model results despite promising results however lack of in situ evapotranspiration et and coarse resolution grace data doesn t allow testing of the model s capability to estimate storage at finer resolutions abera et al 2017 therefore the applicability of the model to estimate storage components at smaller scale basins needs to be further investigated using observed et and finer resolution remote sensing products the soil and water assessment tool swat has been widely applied to study the water balance of different watersheds e g dile and srinivasan 2014 setegn et al 2010b for example setegn et al 2010b calibrating the swat model based on observed streamflow at four major river gauging stations in the lake tana basin gilgel abay gummera rib and megech estimated the different water balance components in the lake tana basin likewise dile and srinivasan 2014 applied the swat model to assess water resources in the lake tana basin using the cfsr and observed weather data easton et al 2010 and white et al 2011 modified the swat model to simulate saturation excess runoff from the landscape using a simple daily water balance coupled to a topographic wetness index evaluation of the model using observed streamflow at the gumera river gauging station white et al 2011 and eight river gauging stations in the upper blue nile basin easton et al 2010 provided satisfactory goodness of fit values van griensven et al 2012 critically reviewed studies that applied the swat model in the upper blue nile basin they reported that the majority of the swat applications in the basin provided satisfactory performance evaluations however van griensven et al 2012 reported that in several of the papers there are unjustified losses in the hydrological budget unrealistic model parameter values and a lack of proper attention to the vegetation and crop processes the latest swat related papers appear to take into account van griensven et al s recommendations e g dile et al 2016a b dile and srinivasan 2014 many attempts have been made to estimate the water balance components of lake tana the largest lake in the upper blue nile basin kebede et al 2006 smec 2007 setegn et al 2010b wale et al 2009 rientjes et al 2011 kebede et al 2006 estimated the water balance components of lake tana from 1960 to 1992 on a monthly basis the nearby climate station bahir dar station was used to represent the lake areal rainfall and to estimate the lake evaporation inflow from ungauged catchments was estimated assuming a runoff coefficient of 0 22 kebede et al 2006 a bathymetric survey carried out in 1937 by morandini 1940 was used to develop elevation volume and area volume relationships smec 2007 also estimated the water balance components on a monthly basis from 1960 through 1995 smec 2007 calculated the runoff from ungauged catchment as a closing term of the water balance components areal rainfall was estimated by inverse distance interpolation using multiple stations in the vicinity of lake tana smec 2007 a bathymetric survey carried out by pietrangeli 1990 was used to simulate lake level smec 2007 wale et al 2009 and rientjes et al 2011 estimated the runoff from ungauged catchments applying a regionalization approach where the calibrated model parameters of the five major gauged watersheds gilgel abay kelti gumera rib and megech were transferred to the ungauged watersheds applying a regional regression model lake areal rainfall and evaporation were estimated based on multiple stations in the proximity of lake tana wale et al 2009 rientjes et al 2011 a bathymetry survey by ayana 2007 was used to define the storage characteristics of the lake wale et al 2009 rientjes et al 2011 3 3 advances in understanding of soil erosion processes through models soil erosion is a serious problem that has threatened the natural resource base in the upper blue nile basin the average annual soil loss in the upper blue nile basin is estimated at 7 t ha garzanti et al 2006 at some locations within this basin however where gullies are formed the annual erosion rate ranges from 120 to 400 t ha tebebu et al 2010 zegeye et al 2011 tilahun et al 2015 the loss of the topsoil and its nutrients is significantly affecting agricultural productivity and overall food security in the ethiopian highlands hurni 1988 mitiku et al 2006 tebebu et al 2010 erosion by runoff water is especially severe in the humid ethiopian highlands where most of the fields are intensively cultivated for crop production due to increasing population bewket and sterk 2003 hurni 1988 temesgen et al 2012 several modeling studies have been undertaken to estimate soil loss and also to identify soil and water management interventions that reduce soil erosion steenhuis et al 2009 and tilahun et al 2013a b developed a simple hydrology and erosion model based on saturation excess runoff principles and interflow processes they used the ratio of direct runoff to total flow to predict the sediment concentration they assumed that only the direct runoff is responsible for the sediment load in the stream they simulated 10 day sediment concentration reasonably well at the gauging station of the upper blue nile at the ethiopian border the swat model was applied e g betrie et al 2011 dile et al 2016a gebremicael et al 2013 setegn et al 2010a 2009 to estimate soil erosion in the upper blue nile basin at different spatial scales model evaluation results have shown that the swat model can reasonably predict soil erosion in the upper blue nile basin betrie et al 2011 estimated the soil loss across all the subbasins in the upper blue nile basin and they reported that the annual soil erosion varies from negligible to over 150 ton ha setegn et al 2009 estimated an average annual sediment yield of 0 to 65 ton ha in the lake tana basin setegn et al 2010a also estimated soil erosion in the anjeni watershed and reported that the average annual soil loss is 28 ton ha dile et al 2016a estimated the annual soil loss in a meso scale watershed in the lake tana basin which ranges between 0 2 ton ha and 197 ton ha depending on biophysical and climatic conditions in the watershed gebremicael et al 2013 applied statistical tests swat modeling and land use change detection to conclude that land use change has caused a significant increase in soil loss in the upper blue nile during the last four decades 3 4 modeling efforts to study environmental changes several hydrological models have been applied in the upper blue nile basin to study global environmental changes most of the earlier applications focused on estimating the water resources or soil erosion in the basin however recent model applications assess the impacts of global environmental changes on hydrology soil erosion crop yield etc table 1 presents a list of major model applications with the corresponding types of models used 3 4 1 climate change impacts climate change is one of the most pressing issues for all mankind in the 21st century its impact however is expected to be more severe on the social ecological systems in developing countries since they have the lowest capacity to adapt there are studies that have assessed the impacts of climate change on the entire upper blue nile basin beyene et al 2009 kim and kaluarachchi 2009 elshamy et al 2009 as well as on its watersheds abdo et al 2009 dile et al 2013 setegn et al 2011 taye et al 2011 beyene et al 2009 studied the hydrologic impacts of climate change on the entire nile basin using the variable infiltration capacity vic model they used climate scenario outputs from 11 global circulation models gcms and two global emissions scenarios a2 medium high and b1 low kim and kaluarachchi 2009 also studied the impact of climate change on the water resources of the upper blue nile basin using a two layer water balance model they used climate change outputs from 6 gcms and adopted the a2 emission scenario kim and kaluarachchi 2009 used the triangular cubic interpolation method watson 1992 to downscale the gcm climate outputs dile et al 2013 and setegn et al 2011 used the swat model while abdo et al 2009 used the hvb model to assess the impact of climate change in the gilgel abay watershed taye et al 2011 used two conceptual hydrological models to assess the impact of climate change on hydrological extremes for the lake tana basin abdo et al 2009 and dile et al 2013 downscaled large scale gcm data from the hadcm3 model using the statistical downscaling model sdsm both studies used the climate scenarios from the a2 medium high and b2 medium low emission scenarios setegn et al 2011 and taye et al 2011 used climate change scenarios from 15 and 17 gcms respectively setegn et al 2011 generated daily climate projections by modifying the historical data sets to represent changes in the gcm climatologies they calculated the difference between the daily cumulative frequency distributions cfds of a gcm output variable for a present day period and a future period thereafter they applied these differences to an observed data setegn et al 2011 considered b2 a1b and a2 emissions scenarios taye et al 2011 applied the frequency perturbation downscaling approach and used a1b medium high and b1 low emission scenarios aich et al 2014 analyzed outputs of 19 cmip5 coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 gcms to study changes in temperature and precipitation for future periods under different representative concentration pathways rcps the authors used bias corrected projected data from five gcms to estimate changes in mean and extreme discharges in the first and second halves of the 21st century under rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 the authors applied the soil and water integrated model swim krysanova et al 2005 to simulate streamflow under different potential climate change scenarios taye et al 2015 reviewed implications of climate change on hydrological extremes in the blue nile basin they concluded that there were no two studies in the basin that use a consistent number and type of climate models emission scenarios downscaling methods or hydrologic models and thus there were discrepancies in the research outputs other studies also evaluated the performance of cmip5 models in the upper blue nile basin bhattacharjee and zaitchik 2015 jury 2015 bhattacharjee and zaitchik 2015 evaluated and ranked the performances of a subset of cmip5 gcms in projecting future rainfall in the upper blue nile basin under a high emissions pathway scenario rcp8 5 the authors used gridded monthly rainfall data for the 1950 1995 period from the climate research unit cru harris et al 2014 and employed four metrics amount and seasonality of rainfall interannual rainfall variability rainfall teleconnections and continental scale climate patterns to evaluate and rank the gcms bcc csm1 1 bcc china ccsm4 ncar usa cesm1 ncar usa csiro mk3 6 csiro australia canesm2 cccma canada gfdl esm2m noaa gfdl usa giss e2 r nasa giss usa hadgem2 es hadley center uk ipsl cm5a lr ipsl france and miroc5 jamstec japan study findings confirmed that almost all of these gcms showed biases ranging from 55 dry bias to 99 wet bias bhattacharjee and zaitchik 2015 nevertheless the authors argued that the ipsl and miroc5 gcms captured both variability and seasonality despite their dry and wet bias respectively furthermore bhattacharjee and zaitchik 2015 performed teleconnections analyses between seasonal precipitation and four indices el niño southern oscillation enso index global sea surface temperature gsst anomaly indian summer monsoon index ism and indian ocean dipole iod were used to study the performances of the gcms in capturing the influences of large scale drivers their report showed that the hadgem ipsl and to a lesser extent miroc5 models reasonably capture the sign and approximate strength of enso and gsst influences moreover miroc5 matches well with observed results for ism and iod but hadgem and ipsl show less consistency for these drivers bhattacharjee and zaitchik 2015 giss and hadgem capture the dominant modes of observed african precipitation variability bhattacharjee and zaitchik 2015 while better agreements were observed between the miroc5 and the results from ism and iod the hadgem and ipsl showed poor relationships with the large scale drivers bhattacharjee and zaitchik 2015 overall giss and hadgem models captured the dominant modes of observed african precipitation variability bhattacharjee and zaitchik 2015 similarly jury 2015 compared rainfall and maximum temperature simulations from 21 and 18 cmip5 gcms respectively with cru3 observations under the rcp6 0 scenario in the ethiopian highlands they used three matrices namely annual cycle of rainfall and maximum temperature spatial distribution of mean and variance and year to year fluctuations based on monthly rainfall and maximum temperature data between 1980 and 2009 jury 2015 reported that while the ccsm4 model showed a better performance in replicating statistics of mean and interannual variability of rainfall in the upper blue nile basin the model ccsm4 resulted in bimodal peaks of rainfall in june and september and was unable to provide realistic representation of rainfall intraseasonal variability overall the ccsm4 gfdl e2g and had g2a models met most of the stepwise model evaluation criteria over the ethiopian highlands on the other hand bhattacharjee and zaitchik 2015 suggested that the selection and application of cmip5 projections in the upper blue nile basin requires careful scrutiny based on metrics specifically relevant to the research goals 3 4 2 land use change impact the relationship between hydrology and land use change takes two trajectories the first deals with impacts of land use change on hydrology while the other deals with impacts of hydrology hydrological changes on land use there are several emerging studies to understand the latter where land use is dramatically changing because of hydrological extremes as a result of climate change for example however most of the earliest literature reported impacts of land use change on hydrology the same happened in the upper blue nile basin where almost all land use related studies dealt with impacts of land use changes on hydrology different approaches and methods were used to study land use change impacts on hydrology in the upper blue nile basin for example statistical analysis and hydrological modeling methods were employed to analyze land use change impacts on hydrology using observed data gebrehiwot et al 2014a b tekleab et al 2014a tekleab et al 2014a applied statistical analysis and a budyko type conceptual model to study the impact of land use land cover change on long term trends of runoff in the jedeb meso scale catchment in the upper blue nile basin remote sensing analysis was also used to document forest cover changes e g gebrehiwot et al 2014a community perception was also used to complement the numerical analysis of the relationship between changes in hydrology and forest cover gebrehiwot et al 2013a generally representations of the complex reality of land use change and flow relationships are oversimplified studies in the upper blue nile basin have tried to argue for the popular belief that deforestation exacerbates soil erosion and diminishes low flows gebrehiwot 2015 such belief influenced the land management policy of the country which promotes increasing forest coverage mowr 2001 even though the impact of deforestation on soil erosion is well documented forest impact on flow regulation has been a debatable issue in the scientific community gebrehiwot 2015 some studies have shown that there have been no major temporal changes in the flow regime in the upper blue nile basin due to land use change gebrehiwot et al 2014b however after the mid 1980s modest changes were observed which were inconsistent among watersheds gebrehiwot et al 2014b kiros 1991 such a change was related to a dramatic natural forest reduction in the southern watersheds and an increase in eucalyptus plantation in the northern part of the basin e g gebrehiwot et al 2014a tests for step change were conducted and higher frequencies of step changes were observed towards the more recent period gebrehiwot et al 2014b perhaps this may suggest that rivers are just starting to respond to influences of land cover change and or climate change di baldassarre et al 2011 mellander et al 2013 however such a premise requires detailed study using the latest data tekleab et al 2014a b in their study in the jedeb meso scale watershed between 1973 and 2010 found enhanced peak flows and a significant increase in the rise and fall rates of the flow hydrograph such watershed behavior may be related to gradual decrease in the soil moisture storage capacity which leads to more surface runoff and less infiltration into the soil layers tekleab et al 2014a community perception and the spatial analysis of watershed characterization studies have shown that forest change could directly affect low flow in the upper blue nile basin gebrehiwot et al 2010 for example the afforestation of eucalyptus reduced low flow while the deforestation of riverine forest increased low flow in the upper blue nile basin in fact it requires further investigation to verify that eucalyptus plantation can reduce low flow regimes in watersheds since the impacts can be site specific cf wullschleger et al 1998 community perception studies in angereb watershed in the upper blue nile basin indicated that afforestation of different forest species for soil conservation practices resulted in an increase in low flows gebrehiwot et al 2013a 3 4 3 impacts of agricultural management practices agriculture in sub saharan africa is largely rainfed which is characterized by low input output features ca 2007 different water and land management techniques have been suggested to improve water productivity and produce more crop per drop of rain rockström et al 2002 dile et al 2016a developed a decision support system using the swat model to understand the implications of water harvesting systems and different rates of nutrient application on upstream and downstream social ecological systems in the lake tana basin they found that supplementary irrigation in combination with nutrient application increased simulated teff eragrostis tef production up to threefold compared to current practices in addition after supplemental irrigation of teff the excess water was used for dry season onion production of 7 66 t ha median across the watershed water harvesting resulted in a reduction in peak flows and an increase in low flows and it substantially reduced yield of sediment leaving the watershed dile et al 2016b temesgen et al 2012 introduced new ways of conservation tillage by involving contour ploughing and constructing invisible sub soil barriers using a traditional maresha winged sub soiler to curb problems of crop yield reduction soil erosion and water logging findings suggest that the experimentation on the new and traditional way of farming practices which were tested on wheat triticum vulgare and teff crops reduced soil erosion increased crop yield and enhanced the farming practices between soil conservation structures temesgen et al 2012 betrie et al 2011 implemented best management practices bmps and estimated their impacts on soil erosion the studied bmps were filter strips stone bunds and reforestation their results showed that significant reduction in sediment yield was observed both at the internal sub basins and basin outlets 3 4 4 impact of economic development there are various infrastructure projects which are already built as well as some that are planned in the upper blue nile basin for example the lake tana and beles regions are identified as among the five growth corridors in ethiopia that could help lift the population out of poverty and also contribute to overall economic growth in the country worldbank 2008 chara chara weir was built at the outlet of lake tana to regulate outflow from the lake for hydropower generation the tana beles inter basin water transfer project was completed in 2010 its purpose was to generate 460 mw hydropower canals are currently under construction to make use of the transferred water for irrigation the koga dam was built on koga river to store water to irrigate 6000 ha of land there are other planned irrigation schemes in the tana beles region that are meant to irrigate 60 000 ha of land alemayehu et al 2010 alemayehu et al 2010 used the weap model to simulate water demand for irrigation hydropower and downstream environmental flows under four plausible scenarios baseline ongoing development likely future development and full potential development they showed that if all the planned development occurs on average 2198 gwh year power could be generated 677 mm3 year of water supplied to irrigation schemes and the mean annual water level of lake tana may be lowered by 0 44 m the role of water in the co evolution of agricultural transformation and energy transition was illustrated for a number of development trajectories for the lake tana basin karlberg et al 2015 it was shown that water needed for energy and agricultural production sometimes exceeds water availability threatening the environmental sustainability of lake tana itself a stakeholder driven approach to intersectoral natural resources management underpinned by quantitative and spatially explicit scenario and planning tools can help to facilitate and strengthen cross sector dialogue thereby contributing to resolving dilemmas and supporting more consistent policy and decision making towards improved resource productivity lower environmental pressures and enhanced human security based on the abay basin integrated master plan adgolign et al 2015 developed three development scenarios current development 1999 2014 medium term development 2015 2030 and long term development 2031 2050 for the dedissa subbasin they assumed irrigated land areas of 9196 ha 132 668 ha and 189 870 ha for the current medium term and long term development scenarios respectively domestic water demand of 3 67 million cubic meters mcm year 6 97 mcm year and 15 57 mcm year were assumed for current mid term and long term development scenarios respectively hydropower generation of 300 mw was assumed only during the long term development scenario for these scenarios they analyzed whether the water demands for the different sectors were satisfied and whether the instream flow requirements were met they found that by the end of the long term scenario there will be a 10 annual flow volume reduction on the didessa river moreover some of the schemes inside the didessa watershed may have unmet demands in the last years of the scenarios however the instream flow requirement will be fully delivered at the outlet of the didessa river ensuring a sufficient amount of clean water is recognized as key for sustainable economic development un 2015 however in the upper blue nile basin there are more than 10 6 and 0 3 million people in rural and urban areas respectively who do not have access to a domestic water supply bceom 1998 in areas with access to water the water use is 30 l per capita per day lpcd in urban areas and 15 lpcd in rural areas bceom 1998 which is far less than the international standard the world health organization who 2003 recommends between 50 and 100 lpcd to meet basic needs similarly 12 and 0 6 million people do not have access to sanitary latrine in rural and urban areas respectively improvement of the water supply and sanitation coverage has not met the challenges of population pressure urbanization and climate change water supply and the sanitation sector can be improved if appropriate policy and institutional frameworks are properly combined bceom 1998 recently the construction of the grand ethiopian renaissance dam gerd has been raising public and scientific debate in the upper blue nile basin riparian countries ethiopia built this dam to reduce energy scarcity in the country ren21 2013 and support economic development and the transformation agenda mofed 2010 while the economic benefits of gerd to ethiopia are widely recognized e g chen and swain 2014 reservoir siltation remains a critical concern due to a severe soil erosion problem in the upper blue nile basin e g betrie et al 2011 egypt is concerned that the construction of gerd may reduce its water supply while sudan hopes that the dam will prevent flooding and siltation problems and also regulate river flow chen and swain 2014 mulat and moges 2014 studied the impacts of the gerd on the performance of the high aswan dam had in egypt during filling assumed 6 years period and operational phases using the mike basin river basin simulation model their findings showed that during the filling period of the gerd reservoir current irrigation water demands from had would be slightly impacted while annual energy output from the had would be reduced by 12 and 7 during the filling and operation phases respectively mulat and moges 2014 kahsay et al 2015 used a multi region multi sector computable general equilibrium modeling framework to assess the direct and indirect economic impacts of the gerd on ethiopia sudan and egypt they suggested that gerd may result in positive economic growth in ethiopia 5 5 and sudan 0 5 during the impounding phase while egypt may incur economic costs especially if a sequence of dry years occur and if sudan extracts a substantial amount of water for various purposes however after it becomes operational the gerd would generate substantial economic benefits that will enhance economic growth and welfare in all three countries kahsay et al 2015 another study by habteyes et al 2015 developed a dynamic optimization model that allows to identify opportunities for pareto improving measures to operate the gerd and aswan high dam for ethiopia south sudan sudan and egypt their findings suggested that ethiopia will be better off and the other countries will not be negatively affected by the construction of the gerd the authors argue that the climate in the ethiopian highlands provides a better water storage environment than the currently used lake nasser in egypt moreover water storage facilities in ethiopia will reduce reservoir siltation problems and ensure a stabilized river flow to sudan therefore if ethiopia egypt and sudan build trust and develop a cooperative development path they can ensure regional economic development and peace chen and swain 2014 habteyes et al 2015 kahsay et al 2015 4 research gaps although considerable advances in water resources research have been observed in the basin numerous research gaps still exist for example several research projects have been done to assess the impact of land use change however land use change is a dynamic subject with various issues to be studied the same is true accounting soil data in hydrological models previous studies in the basin have been focused on a single discipline and lack an integrated approach sufficient field data have not been collected to extensively test hydrological models conceptual theories we will try to highlight some of these research gaps 4 1 land use dynamics not fully addressed land use studies using half a century of data shed some light on the effect of land use change on the hydrology of the upper blue nile basin gebrehiwot et al 2013b although fluctuation in rainfall could explain some of those changes more information and research are needed to further advance the understanding of the complex relationship between forest and streamflow in the temporal dimension factors that contribute to the complex relationship between forests and flow include errors in measuring extreme flows different types of forest cover changes specific timing of forest impacts on flow dynamics between forest and flow relations and scale of forest impacts future studies of forest hydrology in the basin need to address sub watershed scales differences in watershed characteristics including vegetation types and hydrological processes that cause different forest types as forest change will continue in response to a range of drivers from economic drivers at the local level to environmental and climatic drivers on a global scale both short term financial growth and long term environmental impacts need to be addressed bonell 1998 the effect of changes in forest and other land use patterns on the flow regime needs monitoring especially in areas such as the upper blue nile basin where water availability during the dry season is an important factor for food security and the development potential of the region 4 2 soil a central but poorly represented system in water resources studies in the upper blue nile basin soil is one of the major geospatial characteristics that are used to describe a basin in most models since it significantly affects the water budget estimations however limitations on the availability of reliable soil parameter values and their spatial distribution makes it difficult to apply these models successfully for an improved simulation of the hydrological regime proper attention needs to be given to the soil information for the upper blue nile basin soil data including soil physical and chemical properties and their spatial distribution comes from different sources the most utilized soil maps for the region come from fao soil databases fao 1995 the ethiopian ministry of water resources mowr 2009 and the new harmonized world soil database fao et al 2009 the physiochemical properties have been compiled either from literature e g batjes 2002 betrie et al 2011 or by applying pedotransfer functions ptfs e g saxton and rawls 2006 using percent sand silt clay and bulk density for the soil type in the map pedotransfer function is an indirect method of estimating important soil hydraulic properties from easily available data such as soil textural size distribution bulk density and organic matter bouma and lanen 1987 the majority of published papers in the upper blue nile basin did not report detailed information about the soil data source quality and assumptions considered during model setup which makes it difficult to evaluate the accuracy of model estimations some papers provide little information about the soil data e g only the source of the data but not the range of calibrated soil parameters e g ali et al 2014 other papers reported calibrated parameter values but used unrealistic ranges for example soil available water capacity soil awc was multiplied by 1 62 gebremicael et al 2013 and by 1 25 koch and cherie 2013 such a wide range change of parameter values would undermine the physical meaning of the soil dataset and may represent a completely different watershed characteristic depending on the uncertainty of soil information in the region appropriate lower and upper bounds for these parameters needs to be produced similar observations of lack of proper attention to the land cover data were reported by van griensven et al 2012 contradictory reports are found in the literature regarding the effect of soil data resolution on the improvements in streamflow simulations some literature showed that resolution of soil data did not improve streamflow simulations e g boluwade and madramootoo 2013 ye et al 2011 whereas other literature indicated an improvement in streamflow prediction with improved soil data resolution e g sheshukov et al 2011 nevertheless the majority of research showed a difference in the hydrology when different soil data were used li et al 2012 found that difference in the spatial resolution of soil data resulted in a spatially varying output at the local scale however as these variabilities are aggregated throughout the watershed their effects would diminish and may not provide significant change at the catchment outlet similarly using the swat model boluwade and madramootoo 2013 concluded that having high resolution soil data may not mean an improvement in the model predictions despite the contradictory reports the importance of good soil information should not be underestimated the application of the modeling study should determine how detailed the geospatial dataset should be it is important to recognize that it is acceptable to have a lower goodness of fit criteria as long as the watershed characteristics are intact 4 3 limited research in identifying appropriate soil and water conservation measures intensive soil and water conservation activities have been implemented in ethiopia in general and in the upper blue nile basin in particular to mitigate soil loss however the adoption rate for these interventions has been considerably low mitiku et al 2006 this may be due to the questionable effectiveness of such interventions bayabil et al 2017 kassie et al 2011 attributed the mixed results regarding effectiveness of conservation measures to a one size fits all approach of addressing the problem which partly stems from a lack of detailed site specific studies needed for planning conservation measures many of the implemented soil and water conservation swc structures originated from the dust bowl era of the 1930 s in the united states reij et al 1996 these practices which effectively controlled erosion in the us were designed for undulating landscapes with rainfall on the order of 600 mm year irrespective of the fact that the prevailing landforms and hydrology were completely different from the locations where the practices were developed these practices were subsequently transplanted by practitioners and engineers to reduce erosion in other parts of the world hudson 1987 in contrast to the american midwest ethiopia is characterized by steep slopes and rainfall patterns that can yield 600 mm of rain in a single month in most cases the hydrology of runoff generation has not been considered for example steep slopes have been targeted for soil and water conservation practices while in reality most runoff and erosion may be produced on the lower slopes near the rivers and saturated valleys and gullies guzman et al 2013 steenhuis et al 2009 tilahun et al 2013a b in fact some research e g bewket and sterk 2003 zegeye et al 2011 has shown that mid and down slope areas lost more soil by rill erosion than upslope areas tebebu et al 2010 also showed that the water table height above the gully bottom and many natural water pipes were the main causes of the gully erosion processes in the debre mewi area near the lake tana subbasin this suggests that soil and water conservation structures that are suitable for the biophysical situation of the watersheds of the upper blue nile basin should be implemented hydrological modeling will be a valuable guide in identifying suitable areas for placing the soil and water conservation interventions as well as for estimating the effects of such interventions on the biophysical factors the research on identifying appropriate soil and water conservation measures should go hand in hand with the extension services the empirical evidence on the effectiveness of the identified soil and water conservation interventions should be adequately communicated to the farmers otherwise the farmers may have the tendency to reject the technologies due to cost and other factors amsalu and de graaff 2007 recommended that conservation interventions should focus not only on the biophysical performance but also on economic benefits that can be obtained at reasonable discount rates to enhance sustained use 4 4 lack of multidisciplinary water resource research most of the research in the upper blue nile basin is focused on a single discipline for example the majority of the hydrological models have been applied at various spatio temporal scales to estimate a single output e g streamflow at the outlet of a catchment while other applications estimate only a different output e g sediment loss there should be a search for a coupled model application that can predict multiple outcomes across multiple spatial and temporal scales in the basin for example the swat model provides multiple results however even in much of the published swat literature about the upper blue nile basin comprehensive results covering different disciplines were not reported cf van griensven et al 2012 therefore research in the upper blue nile basin should advance the traditional disciplinary approach to involving multiple disciplines barnes 2017 for example emphasis could be given in linking hydrology and soil erosion studies to other disciplines such as ecology the so called ecohydrology moore and heilman 2010 or socio economics 4 5 too little field data to support the modeling efforts little effort has been made in catchment modeling studies in the basin to use extensive field data for model calibration verification purposes or to test models conceptual theories typical catchment experimentation has been done only in limited locations e g anjeni andit tid awramba maybar and debre mawi catchments in fact studies from these catchments were used to generalize for the entire ethiopian highlands e g liu et al 2008 which requires caution field data collected from these catchments are not sufficient to support or reject any given model conceptualization since the data are solely based on the rainfall and runoff and making a generalization based on few experimentations is misleading thus future hydrological models should use additional orthogonal information for model calibration validation and or testing of hydrological theories fenicia et al 2008 winsemius et al 2009 5 recommendations 5 1 on data scarcity and quality since data collection processing documentation and dissemination require substantial financial logistical and time resources hrachowitz et al 2013 significant progress has not been made in the recent past in acquiring quality data in the upper blue nile basin while there has clearly been significant advancement in the global data revolution e g reanalysis satellite data etc the condition of many of the existing gauging stations in the upper blue nile basin is declining for example some of the gauging stations are malfunctioning and others are providing unreliable records due to deposit of debris in river gauging stations or presence of trees and other shadows on meteorological gauging stations furthermore efforts have not been made to increase the spatial density and temporal resolution of the hydro meteorological gauging stations for instance in most of the streamflow gauging stations measurements are taken at a daily time step however daily time step is too coarse to capture flood events in the headwater catchments due to the flashy characteristics of the rivers sediment aggradations and degradation are common features at the stream gauging stations in the headwater catchments however the rating curves both for flow and sediments are rarely updated in the majority of the gauged stations we therefore suggest an increase in the network of hydro metrological gauging stations at different key locations for example putting meteorological gauging stations at the top of mountains existing hydro meteorological gauging stations should be properly maintained and their standards should be improved likewise the rating curves for the river gauging stations should be updated within a reasonable time period we foresee that the remaining data gaps can be bridged with field data collection and remote sensing products 5 2 on the value of field data for improving process understanding field data collection can provide crucial insights for better understanding the hydrological processes at different temporal and spatial scales thus collecting detailed information from experimental catchments would help to understand how and when both surface and sub surface runoff processes are taking place for example monitoring the groundwater level in the hill slopes plateaus and riparian zones would help with understanding of the groundwater dynamics detty and mcguire 2010 mcglynn 2004 tracer experiments can provide additional information to advance the understating of hydrological processes for example tracer data integrated with catchment modeling can be used to separate time and geographic area based runoff components of catchments mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 seibert and mcdonnell 2002 moreover collecting runoff in a nested catchment approach piezometeric levels soil moisture and tracer dynamics data can help to gain better insight in process understanding 5 3 on improving soil data quality unreliability of soil parameter values could arise from the use of pedotransfer functions developed for other areas without considering their suitability for soils in the upper blue nile basin likewise the spatial resolution issue is due to limitations of field observations these limitations would affect the reliability of model simulation outputs depending on the applications of the study we encourage identifying appropriate pedotransfer functions that are suitable for the study areas and also having field observations to resolve low spatial resolution issues in fact there is significant progress towards improving soil data availability and quality for ethiopia in particular and africa in general for improved agronomic hydrological and other applications for example berhanu et al 2013 created an improved spatial soil database at the scale of 1 250 000 for the whole of ethiopia they compiled data from various sources and used the rawls et al 1982 table to assign soil hydraulic properties clustered by soil textural classes the map has a potential for improvement by considering percent sand silt and clay and other easily available measurements instead of textural classes and by utilizing better pedotransfer function that would work better for soils in the region the ethiopian soil information service ethiosis has been collecting intensive soil samples since 2012 ethiosis 2015 as of 2015 isric world soil information released soil data for the conterminous africa at a 250 m grid size for each grid soil parameters that are frequently used for water resources research are provided at six depths 0 5 cm 5 15 cm 15 30 cm 30 60 cm 60 100 cm and 100 200 cm these maps were created by combining soil data from more than 28 000 sampling locations locations from ethiosis were part of this with various environmental covariates hengl et al 2015 such a dataset has a significant potential to improve water resources studies in the region the point datasets will also help to create improved pedotransfer functions that are applicable for soils in the region some of the research ventures concerning the upper blue nile basin were multi million dollar projects e g the nile hydro solidarity project which is funded by the dutch foundation for the advancement of tropical research wotro the swedish research council grant water resources to build social ecological resilience the peer science program of usaid the water land and ecosystem wle program of cgiar etc we suggest that researchers should document details on geospatial data preparation as well as their methods of quality control and quality check similarly funding agencies should produce guidelines about geospatial data handling and sharing data should be the major deliverables of funded projects the spatial and tabular soil information created by one research group needs to be easily accessible for others to use it or detailed information should be provided about the steps followed to create the data for others to replicate it 5 4 remote sensing a promising tool for further data acquisitions as we have witnessed collecting representative spatial and temporal data for water resources modeling is expensive and challenging advances in remote sensing capabilities help researchers to collect such data for watershed scale modeling e g cheema et al 2011 kerr et al 2012 parajka et al 2008 the use of precipitation duan and bastiaanssen 2013 haile 2010 romilly and gebremichael 2011 worqlul et al 2018 2014 soil moisture bitar et al 2012 calvet et al 2007 jackson et al 2012 kerr et al 2012 and evaporation e g bastiaanssen et al 1998 mu et al 2011 su 2002 data for calibrating and validating hydrological models in the upper blue nile basin could help offset the existing data gaps nevertheless the use of remote sensing products to represent the water budget components requires pre validation of the products with ground based measurements a recommended threefold approach in the use of remotely sensed data includes validating the products using them in lieu of field measured data to trigger a hydrologic model and evaluating the uncertainties arising from using these products 5 5 putting the research into practice substantial research has been done in the upper blue nile basin however the ethiopian government has not sufficiently implemented these research outputs into practice for example most of the research stations were abandoned when the research programs were completed an exception to this is the scrp research program institut and hurni 1982 where its experimental research stations become part of the amhara region agricultural research institute arari other government institutions and or universities should follow suit by instituting such field research experimental stations moreover most of the published research outcomes have not been effectively utilized in policy and decision making processes these research activities involve multimillion dollar investments and most of them are tailored to development needs of the country if the findings from all of this research are used to inform the government s policy and practice they may invaluably support its development and transformation agenda 6 conclusions significant advances have been observed in water resources research in the upper blue nile basin the research advanced from estimating surface runoff using rainfall data to estimating other biophysical parameters such as soil erosion crop yield and impacts of land management interventions using advanced physically based models limitations on the quality and quantity of the data are reported as serious challenges on the other hand attempts have been made to bridge data gaps through field data collection and remote sensing this review article identified research gaps and recommended insights that could improve the water resources research in the basin for sustainable water resources management we indeed witness progress in water resources research in the upper blue nile basin however we believe there is opportunity for further advancement the research achievements can substantially support the ethiopian government s

7351,the upper blue nile basin with its main tributaries and distribution of hydrological studies within the subbasins the green bars represent the number of papers published in each subbasin the size of the bar in the legend represents 9 papers which is a scale to factor the bars number of papers at the outlets in the subbasins for example the highest number of papers was found for gilgel abay subbasin which has the tallest bar the bar graphs are located at the outlet of the subbasins except the lake tana water balance studies which are displayed at the center of the lake some studies were conducted at watershed scale and the corresponding rivers were too small to show note the figure does not present all the published literature in the basin rather it mapped water resources literature

temporal data was represented using a rainfall data and the spatial data was represented with b digital elevation model dem data most of the earlier studies used monthly and annual time step rainfall data and the latest research has been using daily and sub daily data likewise improvement in the use of dem data has been observed this suggests that there have been advances in data quality for the

stockholm sweden corresponding author this manuscript was handled by marco borga editor in chief with the assistance of yasuto tachikawa associate editor the upper blue nile basin is considered as the lifeline for 250 million people and contributes 50 gm3 year of water to the nile river poor land management practices in the ethiopian highlands have caused a significant amount of soil erosion thereby threatening the productivity of the ethiopian agricultural system degrading the health of the aquatic ecosystem and shortening the life of downstream reservoirs the upper blue nile basin because of limited research and availability of data has been considered as the great unknown in the recent past however more research has been published nonetheless there is no state of the art review that presents research achievements gaps and future directions hence this paper aims to bridge this gap by reviewing the advances in water resources research in the basin while highlighting research needs and future directions we report that there have been several research projects that try to understand the biogeochemical processes by collecting information on runoff groundwater recharge sediment transport and tracers different types of hydrological models have been applied most of the earlier research used simple conceptual and statistical approaches for trend analysis and water balance estimations mainly using rainfall and evapotranspiration data more recent research has been using advanced semi physically physically based distributed hydrological models using high resolution temporal and spatial data for diverse applications we identified several research gaps and provided recommendations to address them while we have witnessed advances in water resources research in the basin we also foresee opportunities for further advancement incorporating the research findings into policy and practice will significantly benefit the development and transformation agenda of the ethiopian government keywords upper blue nile basin ethiopia state of the art review water resources hydrological models 1 introduction the nile basin is shared by eleven riparian countries and is the lifeline for more than 238 million people living in the basin nbi 2012 the nile water has been crucial for upstream and downstream users with competing needs such as irrigation domestic water supply hydropower industry and other ecosystem services these competing needs are severely compromised by soil erosion in the upstream part of the basin e g in ethiopia and siltation of reservoirs and irrigation canals in the downstream part of the river reach e g in sudan and egypt climate and land use changes and poor land management are other biophysical challenges to the water resources in the basin hurni et al 2005 the nile proper is formed by two major tributaries the white nile and the blue nile the upper blue nile fig 1 originates from the ethiopian plateau and contributes 60 of the flow to the nile river at aswan egypt conway and hulme 1993 sutcliffe and parks 1999 based on long term observations 1912 2003 at the basin outlet in sudan the upper blue nile basin on average discharges 48 9 gm3 year of water tesemma et al 2010 until recently there has been very little published literature on the upper blue nile basin the first major study was the abay blue nile river basin integrated development master plan which was conducted between 1958 and 1963 by the united states bureau of reclamation usbr 1964 a follow up study was conducted by bceom a french engineering consultant to develop a master plan for the upper blue nile basin and other major river basins in ethiopia bceom 1998 because of limited published literature data scarcity and difficulty accessing available data the basin was described as the great unknown waterbury 1988 cited in conway 2000 however advances in hydrological science data collection methods and growing international and national interest in understanding the complex biophysical and socio economic issues have led to significant scientific output in the recent past models spanning from simple conceptual ones to ones that are more data intensive and fully distributed have been applied however most of the published research has been concentrated at the headwaters of the upper blue nile basin fig 1 there are also several studies that have been published using streamflow data at the outlet of the river at the sudan border fig 1 although there have been significant advances in water resources research in the basin the progress has not yet been documented in a consolidated manner this makes it difficult to know what has been achieved and what research gaps still remain a state of the art review will help to compile achievements in water resources research identify gaps and provide insights for future research in the basin the objectives of this paper are therefore to review the advances in the water resources research in the upper blue nile basin present research gaps stimulate discussion and provide recommendations for future research this review mainly focuses on biophysical water resources research literature that presents socio economic hydro political and institutional issues as well as similar subjects was not covered 2 data and process understanding 2 1 challenges in data acquisition and advancement a major research challenge in the upper blue nile basin is availability of long term hydro climatic data records of rainfall data started for addis ababa station in 1896 and for gore and gambela beginning in the first decade of the 1900s conway 2000 however records for other climate gauging stations began during the 1950s and 1960s after the ethiopian national meteorological services agency nmsa was established conway 2000 recording hydrological data for the upstream part of the upper blue nile basin started in 1923 for example hurst and phillips 1933 reported that records of lake tana outflow exist from 1923 to 1930 a concerted program of river flow data collection in ethiopia was started in 1956 after the establishment of the ethiopian water resources department abate 1994 cited in conway 2000 however most of the earlier data had coarse temporal resolutions fig 2 and data collection efforts were concentrated in the upper part of the basin moreover the data had substantial missing records e g conway 2000 similar to the temporal data the spatial data e g digital elevation model dem land use and soil used in the past research had coarse spatial resolution fig 2 nevertheless most of the past research used these coarse spatial and temporal resolution data conway 2000 1997 hurst and phillips 1933 johnson and curtis 1994 kebede et al 2006 mishra and hata 2006 although advances in improvement in temporal data resolution have been recorded there are also critical challenges with existing data acquisition techniques in the basin for example the spatial distribution of existing observational hydro meteorological networks is so sparse that most of the meteorological gauging stations are located in towns along the main roads haile 2010 tekleab et al 2015 placing meteorological gauges in such a manner will not properly capture spatial topographic features such as mountains since rainfall amounts are higher in mountainous areas placement of meteorological gauges in such a manner will distort hydrological estimates bayabil et al 2016 suggested that rainfall in monsoon climates which is common in the upper blue nile basin is likely to vary over short distances similarly studies found that rainfall in the ethiopian highlands including the upper blue nile basin significantly varies in space bewket and conway 2007 bitew et al 2010 bitew et al 2010 reported that daily rainfall between rain gauges showed an up to 424 coefficient of variation likewise most of the stream gauging stations do not have proper staff gauge representation upstream of small to medium tributary rivers except a few experimental watersheds fig 1 moreover modeling of sediment accumulation in the water bodies is limited by lack of historic sediment concentration data existing models simulate sediment concentration using data generated from sediment rating curves the rating curves are established based on sediment concentration measured during high flow seasons this often results in residual errors that are not uniformly distributed throughout the range of streamflow data adding to uncertainty in sediment modeling practices moreover water quality monitoring stations are almost nonexistent in the upper blue nile basin emama ligdi et al 2010 thus such data limitations may undermine efforts to understand the biophysical processes in the basin however we observed that recent advances in data acquisition in the upper blue nile basin have improved scientific exploration in the basin for example reanalysis data have helped to bridge the limitation of locally measured climate data dile and srinivasan 2014 presence of high resolution and real time satellite data helped to validate bias correct and downscale satellite data dinku et al 2008 duan and bastiaanssen 2013 habib et al 2014 validated satellite rainfall data in the upper blue nile basin include tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr multi sensor precipitation estimate geostationary mpeg and climate prediction center morphing cmorph worqlul et al 2014 advances in remote sensing technology also enabled the use of high resolution satellite data for land use change studies gebrehiwot et al 2014a kaba et al 2014 generated time series data of total suspended solids tss from remotely sensed images at one of the river mouths of lake tana the authors used the data to calibrate and validate the soil and water assessment tool swat model the results provide a scientific basis for using time series sediment concentration data generated from modis reflectance measurements in lieu of sediment data from rating curves despite significant advances in data acquisitions data quality issues are still significant and further research needs to be done to address the problem although data limitations have hampered research on process understanding and hydrological modeling to the extent that is required for sustainable water resources management there are several research works that attempt to explore biogeochemical processes in the basin process understanding and hydrological modeling research is also generating a significant amount of data that can be used for planning sustainable water resources management strategies in the basin 2 2 advances in process understanding through experimental studies biogeochemical processes in the ethiopian highlands are little understood different research programs undertook extensive field research to understand the biophysical processes in the upper blue nile basin the first program was the soil conservation research program scrp hurni 1988 institut and hurni 1982 the program collected rainfall runoff soil loss and crop yield data from six experimental watersheds in ethiopia and one watershed in eritrea this research contributed to understanding soil erosion and soil conservation in semi arid sub humid and humid areas of ethiopia grunder 1988 herweg and ludi 1999 based on the scrp field measured runoff and erosion data estimated that the soil and water conservation practices resulted soil loss changes between 100 and 37 while the impacts on runoff ranged between 95 and 65 the authors reported that soil loss and runoff decreased shortly after the implementation of the soil conservation interventions herweg and ludi 1999 however runoff and soil loss showed an increase with time because the recommended soil and water conservation interventions became ineffective population increased and land use changed hurni et al 2005 dagnew et al 2015 oostwoud wijdenes and bryan 2001 similarly guzman et al 2017 reported that soil and water conservation practices in the anjeni watershed in the upper blue nile basin were effective in reducing runoff and erosion only for five years after installation while after nine years the measures had almost no impact lack of proper maintenance of the soil and water conservation interventions may have contributed to their ineffectiveness recently a research program at bahir dar university in collaboration with cornell university has been collecting different relevant data to understand runoff generation processes in various watersheds in the ethiopian highlands e g tilahun et al 2016 2013 bayabil et al 2016 2015 2010 there is still disagreement regarding the nature of the runoff initiation mechanisms and their controlling factors in the upper blue nile basin while several reports from this program e g bayabil et al 2010 steenhuis et al 2009 tilahun et al 2014 highlight saturation excess as the dominant runoff generation mechanism in the ethiopian highlands other studies e g bewket and sterk 2005 conclude that the infiltration excess runoff mechanism was dominant applicability of the curve number cn method for estimating surface runoff was tested in three small watersheds in the lake tana basin by the stockholm environment institute sei and stockholm resilience center src dile et al 2016d this research showed that while the cn method was effective in estimating surface runoff during high intensity rainfall conditions it underestimated runoff from low intensity rainfall events the study concluded that the cn method is useful to estimate surface runoff for water management purposes it is worth mentioning that for water management applications high intensity rainfall events that generate large amounts of runoff are critically important because they fill reservoirs and ponds dile et al 2016c under the bahir dar university and cornell university research program extensive field measurements were conducted in five upland watersheds within the upper blue nile basin and one watershed in the awash basin to understand the physical processes underlying runoff and soil erosion liu et al 2008 tilahun et al 2013b bayabil 2017 2016 infiltration rate rainfall intensity shallow groundwater level sediment concentration and runoff were measured at the outlet and nested watersheds outlet in aweramba debre mawi enechilala anjeni andit tid and maybar for the first three watersheds aweramba debre mawi and enechilala field measurements have been available since 2012 while for the remaining three scrp watersheds data has been available since 1982 gully profiles were monitored in two watersheds debre mawi and enechilaila to estimate the gully soil loss before and after the rainy season ayele et al 2016 tebebu et al 2010 zegeye et al 2011 rill erosion measurements for various storm events during the rainy period was conducted in debre mawi watershed to estimate the soil loss by rill zegeye et al 2011 tilahun et al 2014 annual soil loss in the upland watersheds with active gullying reaches up to 400 t ha tebebu et al 2010 the annual soil loss contribution from rills was estimated at 60 t ha tilahun et al 2014 however the annual sediment yield at the outlet of the six watersheds ranged from 5 to 75 t ha ayele et al 2016 guzman et al 2013 the variations among the six watersheds are due to the availability of and differences in gullies in the upland watersheds tebebu et al 2015 on the other hand a study by bayabil et al 2017 indicated that erosion rates show significant variation owing to variations in measurement scale land management and the progression of the rainy season bayabil et al 2017 concluded that direct extrapolation of point plot and field scale erosion rates to catchment and basin scales and vice versa could be erroneous and misleading 2 3 advances in tracer data for understanding flow processes and nutrient transport recent research has started to use tracer data to understand the biogeochemical processes in the upper blue nile basin for example tekleab et al 2015 used field observation and stable isotope data to conceptualize hydrologic processes in two catchments chemoga and jedeb of the upper blue nile basin the isotope samples in precipitation spring water and streamflow were used to separate the runoff components and estimate mean residence times thereby characterizing the spatial and temporal variations of moisture fluxes the isotopic composition of precipitation exhibited marked seasonal variations which suggest that various sources of moisture generate rainfall in the choke mountains 4000 m a s l of the upper blue nile basin tekleab et al 2014b analysis of the isotope data indicated the dominance of event water which account an average of 71 and 64 of the total runoff during the wet season in the chemoga and jedeb catchments respectively the mean residence times of the stream water were 4 1 and 6 0 months for the whole chemoga and jedeb catchments respectively these observations suggest that saturation excess overland flow is the dominant runoff generation mechanism in the two studied catchments tekleab et al 2015 agricultural intensification and expansion is releasing non point source pollutants to the freshwater ecosystem in the upper blue nile basin in particular and ethiopia in general gebre mariam 2002 such pollutants are severely compromising the health of the riverine ecosystem for example anteneh 2014 reported that one third of the shoreline of lake tana is infested with water hyacinths a few studies have taken place recently that investigate non point source pollution of fresh water systems in the upper blue nile basin for example moges et al 2016 examined non point sources of phosphorus contribution in an agricultural watershed near lake tana they measured dissolved phosphorous concentration dpc in groundwater soil available phosphorous at three landscape positions discharge sediment and dpc at the outlet of the watershed this study highlighted that the major source of phosphorous is the saturated valley bottom alemu et al 2017 studied the concentration of dissolved phosphorus in lake tana and its tributaries from 2010 to 2012 and the rainy months of 2014 they reported that dissolved phosphorous concentration was higher in the rivers than in the lake they concluded that adsorption of phosphorous with the sediment and binding with metallic ions may be the causes of lower dissolved phosphorous concentration in the lake the dissolved phosphorous concentration was much higher during the rainy season than in the dry season alemu et al 2017 3 advances in statistical analysis and hydrological modeling statistical analysis and hydrological models are essential to understanding and predicting the spatial and temporal variability of water resources e g uhlenbrook et al 2004 previously the limitation of data availability and computational requirements limited study to the use of simple statistical and conceptual models conway 2000 kim and kaluarachchi 2008 2009 for example some of the conceptual models only used rainfall temperature and evapotranspiration to model the water balance of the upper blue nile basin conway 1997 however advances in availability of temporal and spatial data and computational power enabled application of state of the art hydrological models such as the soil and water assessment tool swat variable infiltration capacity vic hydrologiska byråns vattenbalansavdelning hvb water evaluation and planning system weap cropwat and indicators of hydrologic alterations iha among others 3 1 statistical analysis statistical analysis techniques have been widely employed in the upper blue nile basin to assess trends in hydrological variables and soil erosion for example tekleab et al 2013 applied mann kendall and pettitt tests to assess trends of three hydro meteorological variables stream flow temperature and precipitation represented by 9 12 and 13 gauging stations respectively within the upper blue nile basin the study indicated that temperature showed a statistically significant increasing trend while changes in mean annual and mean seasonal precipitation did not exhibit any statistically significant trends moreover stream flow did not show a consistent direction of statistically increasing or decreasing trends rather heterogeneous results were detected tesemma et al 2010 employed the mann kendall test and sen s t test to study trends in climate and hydrologic variables at three river gauging stations at bahir dar kessie and el diem at the sudan border for the 1964 2003 period the authors reported significant increases in discharge during the main rainy season june to september at all three stations while seasonal and annual basin wide average rainfall trends were not significant they found no significant trend in the observed annual runoff at el diem the annual discharge at kessie and bahir dar increased significantly by about 25 during the study period tesemma et al 2010 gebremicael et al 2013 used the mann kendall and pettitt tests to detect trends of sediment load 1980 2009 at the outlet of the upper blue nile basin at el diem station and reported significant increasing trends at a 5 confidence level mengistu et al 2014 studied spatial and temporal variability and trends of rainfall and mean maximum and minimum temperatures at seasonal and annual timescales for the upper blue nile basin using the least square method the authors reported that the northern central and southern parts of the basin experienced increasing trends of both mean annual maximum temperature and mean annual minimum temperature they also observed a statistically significant warming trend of mean annual minimum temperature in the southwestern parts of the basin moreover the same study showed an increasing albeit non significant annual rainfall trend in the upper blue nile basin on the other hand tabari et al 2015 reported decreasing though non significant trends in annual rainfall at most 80 of the 16 stations in the upper blue nile basin tabari et al 2015 used the modified mann kendall test and the sen s slope approach statistical analysis techniques have also been applied in the upper blue nile basin to assess step changes in hydrological variables due to biophysical changes in the watersheds gebrehiwot et al 2014b used the mann kendall statistical test to detect step changes in hydrological variables of 12 watersheds in the upper blue nile basin for a period of 45 years 1960 2004 this time period was split into three sub periods to represent the major political changes in ethiopia in 1975 and 1991 the hydrological variables included in the multivariate analyses were rainfall total flow high flow low flow low flow index and runoff coefficient gebrehiwot et al 2011 also applied multivariate statistical analysis on 32 meso scale 100 2000 km2 watersheds in the basin to study the relationship between different land cover and hydrological regimes using hydrology soil land use geology climate and topography data from 1960 to 1963 multivariate analysis was employed with the time series data between 1960 and 2005 of three rivers gilgel abay birr and upper didesa including studies on community perception and remote sensing analysis gebrehiwot 2015 the findings related to step changes due to land use change effects are highlighted under the land use change impacts in section 3 4 2 in addition to the common statistical tests such as mann kendell sen s and pettit that are widely used to detect trends and step changes taye and willems 2012 applied the quantile perturbation method qpm to study the temporal variability of rainfall and extreme high and low flows the qpm method is an empirical statistical analysis that examines temporal evaluation of trends and oscillation patterns of extremes taye and willems 2012 reported that high and low river flows and rainfall show a particular variation pattern and the extremes show significant decadal variations the extremes in the 1980s showed statistically significant negative anomalies compared to the long term reference period of 1964 2009 while the remaining period showed positive anomalies but with less statistical significance they suggested that changes that occur in the pacific ocean may contribute to the decadal oscillations in climate and related high and low flow availability in the upper blue nile the findings from taye and willems 2012 indicated that changes in hydroclimatic extremes were related to anthropogenic and natural processes for example they suggested that the increasing trend in recent years at the el diem gauging station is due to the construction of chera chera weir at the outlet of lake tana the decreasing trend at the gilgel abay gauging station is related to both water abstraction in the dry season for different purposes and land cover change cf bewket and sterk 2005 taye and willems 2012 also showed that oceanic influences can contribute to the variability in rainfall and flow extremes the presence of multi decadal oscillations in rainfall and streamflow extremes and volumes suggest that trend investigations should use long term data taye and willems 2012 3 2 advances in hydrological modeling for process understanding and catchment water balance several hydrological models have been applied in the upper blue nile basin to understand hydrological processes and estimate catchment water balance the earlier studies used simple conceptual models however more recent studies used advanced physically and semi physically based models for example conway 1997 developed a simple water balance model for the upper blue nile basin in this model vegetation cover was not explicitly considered and soil characteristics were spatially invariant the model was used to investigate spatial variability in the sensitivity of runoff to changes in rainfall and potential evaporation tekleab et al 2011 applied the budyko s hypothesis to understand the water balance relationships of the upper blue nile catchments from meso scale up to entire basin scale the budyko 1974 curve has potential to explore the long term annual water balance in the catchment based on hydro climatic factors the curve interprets the competition between the available water and available energy results showed that the curves enable first order functional classification of catchments in the upper blue nile basin catchments that exhibit different evaporation ratios were represented by different curves this could be attributed to variation in soil moisture storage capacity and annual runoff coefficient the budyko model is simple and parsimonious it can be applied in data scarce regions like the upper blue nile basin however development of the curves on the annual time scale lacks physical basis uhlenbrook et al 2010 applied the hvb model in the gilgel abay and koga watersheds of the upper blue nile basin with three modes of catchment representation i lumped ii lumped with multiple vegetation zones and iii semi distributed with multiple vegetation and elevation zones to analyze catchment behavior in these watersheds rientjes et al 2011 applied the hvb model to study the hydrological balance of lake tana in the upper blue nile basin they used the hvb model to regionalize parameters and estimate surface runoff generation from ungauged catchments collick et al 2009 developed a semi distributed water balance model based on the thornthwaite and mather 1955 model for the upper blue nile basin and its catchments as a tool for planning watershed management and conservation activities other studies e g steenhuis et al 2009 tesemma et al 2010 tilahun et al 2013a b used the same method to understand runoff processes in the scrp catchments and the upper blue nile at basin scale the parameter efficient distributed model ped a continuous daily simulation conceptual semi distributed hydrologic model was also developed based on the theory of simple thornthwaite and mather soil water balance models steenhuis and molen 1986 thornthwaite and mather 1955 ped is considered to be a parsimoniousmodel and requires minimum input data requiring only daily rainfall and long term average monthly potential evaporation it also requires observed flow for model calibration and validation by dividing the landscape into three areas periodically saturated areas degraded hill slopes and permeable hill slopes steenhuis et al 2009 several studies e g steenhuis et al 2009 tilahun et al 2013a b guzman et al 2017 applied ped in the entire upper blue nile basin and its watersheds to predict discharge and sediment they showed that this conceptual topography based model can reasonably describe the watershed hydrologic processes both hydrology and sediment in the monsoonal climate of ethiopia ped is suggested to be an efficient model in areas such as the upper blue nile basin where there is limited data steenhuis et al 2009 tilahun et al 2013a b guzman et al 2017 the jgrass newage system of hydrological forecasting and water resources modeling formetta et al 2014 was applied in the upper blue nile basin abera et al 2017 the jgrass newage is designed and implemented to simplify comparison and reproducibility of modeling solutions and results using a visualization system via udig based geographic information system and component based modeling systems formetta et al 2014 the latter is built on top of the object modeling system framework abera et al 2017 applied the jgrass newage model to estimate all the components of the hydrological cycle using sparsely available hydrometeorological data and satellite products abera et al 2017 verified the capability of the jgrass newage model to estimate streamflow using available observations from different gauging locations in the upper blue nile basin the authors concluded that the model could be used to forecast streamflow at ungauged locations with some success the model s capability to estimate storage the water contained in the surface soil snow and ice lakes and rivers and biomass and spatio temporal variability was verified using data from the basin scale grace twsc gravity recovery and climate experiment total water storage change which showed high correlation and similar amplitude with the jgrass newage model results despite promising results however lack of in situ evapotranspiration et and coarse resolution grace data doesn t allow testing of the model s capability to estimate storage at finer resolutions abera et al 2017 therefore the applicability of the model to estimate storage components at smaller scale basins needs to be further investigated using observed et and finer resolution remote sensing products the soil and water assessment tool swat has been widely applied to study the water balance of different watersheds e g dile and srinivasan 2014 setegn et al 2010b for example setegn et al 2010b calibrating the swat model based on observed streamflow at four major river gauging stations in the lake tana basin gilgel abay gummera rib and megech estimated the different water balance components in the lake tana basin likewise dile and srinivasan 2014 applied the swat model to assess water resources in the lake tana basin using the cfsr and observed weather data easton et al 2010 and white et al 2011 modified the swat model to simulate saturation excess runoff from the landscape using a simple daily water balance coupled to a topographic wetness index evaluation of the model using observed streamflow at the gumera river gauging station white et al 2011 and eight river gauging stations in the upper blue nile basin easton et al 2010 provided satisfactory goodness of fit values van griensven et al 2012 critically reviewed studies that applied the swat model in the upper blue nile basin they reported that the majority of the swat applications in the basin provided satisfactory performance evaluations however van griensven et al 2012 reported that in several of the papers there are unjustified losses in the hydrological budget unrealistic model parameter values and a lack of proper attention to the vegetation and crop processes the latest swat related papers appear to take into account van griensven et al s recommendations e g dile et al 2016a b dile and srinivasan 2014 many attempts have been made to estimate the water balance components of lake tana the largest lake in the upper blue nile basin kebede et al 2006 smec 2007 setegn et al 2010b wale et al 2009 rientjes et al 2011 kebede et al 2006 estimated the water balance components of lake tana from 1960 to 1992 on a monthly basis the nearby climate station bahir dar station was used to represent the lake areal rainfall and to estimate the lake evaporation inflow from ungauged catchments was estimated assuming a runoff coefficient of 0 22 kebede et al 2006 a bathymetric survey carried out in 1937 by morandini 1940 was used to develop elevation volume and area volume relationships smec 2007 also estimated the water balance components on a monthly basis from 1960 through 1995 smec 2007 calculated the runoff from ungauged catchment as a closing term of the water balance components areal rainfall was estimated by inverse distance interpolation using multiple stations in the vicinity of lake tana smec 2007 a bathymetric survey carried out by pietrangeli 1990 was used to simulate lake level smec 2007 wale et al 2009 and rientjes et al 2011 estimated the runoff from ungauged catchments applying a regionalization approach where the calibrated model parameters of the five major gauged watersheds gilgel abay kelti gumera rib and megech were transferred to the ungauged watersheds applying a regional regression model lake areal rainfall and evaporation were estimated based on multiple stations in the proximity of lake tana wale et al 2009 rientjes et al 2011 a bathymetry survey by ayana 2007 was used to define the storage characteristics of the lake wale et al 2009 rientjes et al 2011 3 3 advances in understanding of soil erosion processes through models soil erosion is a serious problem that has threatened the natural resource base in the upper blue nile basin the average annual soil loss in the upper blue nile basin is estimated at 7 t ha garzanti et al 2006 at some locations within this basin however where gullies are formed the annual erosion rate ranges from 120 to 400 t ha tebebu et al 2010 zegeye et al 2011 tilahun et al 2015 the loss of the topsoil and its nutrients is significantly affecting agricultural productivity and overall food security in the ethiopian highlands hurni 1988 mitiku et al 2006 tebebu et al 2010 erosion by runoff water is especially severe in the humid ethiopian highlands where most of the fields are intensively cultivated for crop production due to increasing population bewket and sterk 2003 hurni 1988 temesgen et al 2012 several modeling studies have been undertaken to estimate soil loss and also to identify soil and water management interventions that reduce soil erosion steenhuis et al 2009 and tilahun et al 2013a b developed a simple hydrology and erosion model based on saturation excess runoff principles and interflow processes they used the ratio of direct runoff to total flow to predict the sediment concentration they assumed that only the direct runoff is responsible for the sediment load in the stream they simulated 10 day sediment concentration reasonably well at the gauging station of the upper blue nile at the ethiopian border the swat model was applied e g betrie et al 2011 dile et al 2016a gebremicael et al 2013 setegn et al 2010a 2009 to estimate soil erosion in the upper blue nile basin at different spatial scales model evaluation results have shown that the swat model can reasonably predict soil erosion in the upper blue nile basin betrie et al 2011 estimated the soil loss across all the subbasins in the upper blue nile basin and they reported that the annual soil erosion varies from negligible to over 150 ton ha setegn et al 2009 estimated an average annual sediment yield of 0 to 65 ton ha in the lake tana basin setegn et al 2010a also estimated soil erosion in the anjeni watershed and reported that the average annual soil loss is 28 ton ha dile et al 2016a estimated the annual soil loss in a meso scale watershed in the lake tana basin which ranges between 0 2 ton ha and 197 ton ha depending on biophysical and climatic conditions in the watershed gebremicael et al 2013 applied statistical tests swat modeling and land use change detection to conclude that land use change has caused a significant increase in soil loss in the upper blue nile during the last four decades 3 4 modeling efforts to study environmental changes several hydrological models have been applied in the upper blue nile basin to study global environmental changes most of the earlier applications focused on estimating the water resources or soil erosion in the basin however recent model applications assess the impacts of global environmental changes on hydrology soil erosion crop yield etc table 1 presents a list of major model applications with the corresponding types of models used 3 4 1 climate change impacts climate change is one of the most pressing issues for all mankind in the 21st century its impact however is expected to be more severe on the social ecological systems in developing countries since they have the lowest capacity to adapt there are studies that have assessed the impacts of climate change on the entire upper blue nile basin beyene et al 2009 kim and kaluarachchi 2009 elshamy et al 2009 as well as on its watersheds abdo et al 2009 dile et al 2013 setegn et al 2011 taye et al 2011 beyene et al 2009 studied the hydrologic impacts of climate change on the entire nile basin using the variable infiltration capacity vic model they used climate scenario outputs from 11 global circulation models gcms and two global emissions scenarios a2 medium high and b1 low kim and kaluarachchi 2009 also studied the impact of climate change on the water resources of the upper blue nile basin using a two layer water balance model they used climate change outputs from 6 gcms and adopted the a2 emission scenario kim and kaluarachchi 2009 used the triangular cubic interpolation method watson 1992 to downscale the gcm climate outputs dile et al 2013 and setegn et al 2011 used the swat model while abdo et al 2009 used the hvb model to assess the impact of climate change in the gilgel abay watershed taye et al 2011 used two conceptual hydrological models to assess the impact of climate change on hydrological extremes for the lake tana basin abdo et al 2009 and dile et al 2013 downscaled large scale gcm data from the hadcm3 model using the statistical downscaling model sdsm both studies used the climate scenarios from the a2 medium high and b2 medium low emission scenarios setegn et al 2011 and taye et al 2011 used climate change scenarios from 15 and 17 gcms respectively setegn et al 2011 generated daily climate projections by modifying the historical data sets to represent changes in the gcm climatologies they calculated the difference between the daily cumulative frequency distributions cfds of a gcm output variable for a present day period and a future period thereafter they applied these differences to an observed data setegn et al 2011 considered b2 a1b and a2 emissions scenarios taye et al 2011 applied the frequency perturbation downscaling approach and used a1b medium high and b1 low emission scenarios aich et al 2014 analyzed outputs of 19 cmip5 coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 gcms to study changes in temperature and precipitation for future periods under different representative concentration pathways rcps the authors used bias corrected projected data from five gcms to estimate changes in mean and extreme discharges in the first and second halves of the 21st century under rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 the authors applied the soil and water integrated model swim krysanova et al 2005 to simulate streamflow under different potential climate change scenarios taye et al 2015 reviewed implications of climate change on hydrological extremes in the blue nile basin they concluded that there were no two studies in the basin that use a consistent number and type of climate models emission scenarios downscaling methods or hydrologic models and thus there were discrepancies in the research outputs other studies also evaluated the performance of cmip5 models in the upper blue nile basin bhattacharjee and zaitchik 2015 jury 2015 bhattacharjee and zaitchik 2015 evaluated and ranked the performances of a subset of cmip5 gcms in projecting future rainfall in the upper blue nile basin under a high emissions pathway scenario rcp8 5 the authors used gridded monthly rainfall data for the 1950 1995 period from the climate research unit cru harris et al 2014 and employed four metrics amount and seasonality of rainfall interannual rainfall variability rainfall teleconnections and continental scale climate patterns to evaluate and rank the gcms bcc csm1 1 bcc china ccsm4 ncar usa cesm1 ncar usa csiro mk3 6 csiro australia canesm2 cccma canada gfdl esm2m noaa gfdl usa giss e2 r nasa giss usa hadgem2 es hadley center uk ipsl cm5a lr ipsl france and miroc5 jamstec japan study findings confirmed that almost all of these gcms showed biases ranging from 55 dry bias to 99 wet bias bhattacharjee and zaitchik 2015 nevertheless the authors argued that the ipsl and miroc5 gcms captured both variability and seasonality despite their dry and wet bias respectively furthermore bhattacharjee and zaitchik 2015 performed teleconnections analyses between seasonal precipitation and four indices el niño southern oscillation enso index global sea surface temperature gsst anomaly indian summer monsoon index ism and indian ocean dipole iod were used to study the performances of the gcms in capturing the influences of large scale drivers their report showed that the hadgem ipsl and to a lesser extent miroc5 models reasonably capture the sign and approximate strength of enso and gsst influences moreover miroc5 matches well with observed results for ism and iod but hadgem and ipsl show less consistency for these drivers bhattacharjee and zaitchik 2015 giss and hadgem capture the dominant modes of observed african precipitation variability bhattacharjee and zaitchik 2015 while better agreements were observed between the miroc5 and the results from ism and iod the hadgem and ipsl showed poor relationships with the large scale drivers bhattacharjee and zaitchik 2015 overall giss and hadgem models captured the dominant modes of observed african precipitation variability bhattacharjee and zaitchik 2015 similarly jury 2015 compared rainfall and maximum temperature simulations from 21 and 18 cmip5 gcms respectively with cru3 observations under the rcp6 0 scenario in the ethiopian highlands they used three matrices namely annual cycle of rainfall and maximum temperature spatial distribution of mean and variance and year to year fluctuations based on monthly rainfall and maximum temperature data between 1980 and 2009 jury 2015 reported that while the ccsm4 model showed a better performance in replicating statistics of mean and interannual variability of rainfall in the upper blue nile basin the model ccsm4 resulted in bimodal peaks of rainfall in june and september and was unable to provide realistic representation of rainfall intraseasonal variability overall the ccsm4 gfdl e2g and had g2a models met most of the stepwise model evaluation criteria over the ethiopian highlands on the other hand bhattacharjee and zaitchik 2015 suggested that the selection and application of cmip5 projections in the upper blue nile basin requires careful scrutiny based on metrics specifically relevant to the research goals 3 4 2 land use change impact the relationship between hydrology and land use change takes two trajectories the first deals with impacts of land use change on hydrology while the other deals with impacts of hydrology hydrological changes on land use there are several emerging studies to understand the latter where land use is dramatically changing because of hydrological extremes as a result of climate change for example however most of the earliest literature reported impacts of land use change on hydrology the same happened in the upper blue nile basin where almost all land use related studies dealt with impacts of land use changes on hydrology different approaches and methods were used to study land use change impacts on hydrology in the upper blue nile basin for example statistical analysis and hydrological modeling methods were employed to analyze land use change impacts on hydrology using observed data gebrehiwot et al 2014a b tekleab et al 2014a tekleab et al 2014a applied statistical analysis and a budyko type conceptual model to study the impact of land use land cover change on long term trends of runoff in the jedeb meso scale catchment in the upper blue nile basin remote sensing analysis was also used to document forest cover changes e g gebrehiwot et al 2014a community perception was also used to complement the numerical analysis of the relationship between changes in hydrology and forest cover gebrehiwot et al 2013a generally representations of the complex reality of land use change and flow relationships are oversimplified studies in the upper blue nile basin have tried to argue for the popular belief that deforestation exacerbates soil erosion and diminishes low flows gebrehiwot 2015 such belief influenced the land management policy of the country which promotes increasing forest coverage mowr 2001 even though the impact of deforestation on soil erosion is well documented forest impact on flow regulation has been a debatable issue in the scientific community gebrehiwot 2015 some studies have shown that there have been no major temporal changes in the flow regime in the upper blue nile basin due to land use change gebrehiwot et al 2014b however after the mid 1980s modest changes were observed which were inconsistent among watersheds gebrehiwot et al 2014b kiros 1991 such a change was related to a dramatic natural forest reduction in the southern watersheds and an increase in eucalyptus plantation in the northern part of the basin e g gebrehiwot et al 2014a tests for step change were conducted and higher frequencies of step changes were observed towards the more recent period gebrehiwot et al 2014b perhaps this may suggest that rivers are just starting to respond to influences of land cover change and or climate change di baldassarre et al 2011 mellander et al 2013 however such a premise requires detailed study using the latest data tekleab et al 2014a b in their study in the jedeb meso scale watershed between 1973 and 2010 found enhanced peak flows and a significant increase in the rise and fall rates of the flow hydrograph such watershed behavior may be related to gradual decrease in the soil moisture storage capacity which leads to more surface runoff and less infiltration into the soil layers tekleab et al 2014a community perception and the spatial analysis of watershed characterization studies have shown that forest change could directly affect low flow in the upper blue nile basin gebrehiwot et al 2010 for example the afforestation of eucalyptus reduced low flow while the deforestation of riverine forest increased low flow in the upper blue nile basin in fact it requires further investigation to verify that eucalyptus plantation can reduce low flow regimes in watersheds since the impacts can be site specific cf wullschleger et al 1998 community perception studies in angereb watershed in the upper blue nile basin indicated that afforestation of different forest species for soil conservation practices resulted in an increase in low flows gebrehiwot et al 2013a 3 4 3 impacts of agricultural management practices agriculture in sub saharan africa is largely rainfed which is characterized by low input output features ca 2007 different water and land management techniques have been suggested to improve water productivity and produce more crop per drop of rain rockström et al 2002 dile et al 2016a developed a decision support system using the swat model to understand the implications of water harvesting systems and different rates of nutrient application on upstream and downstream social ecological systems in the lake tana basin they found that supplementary irrigation in combination with nutrient application increased simulated teff eragrostis tef production up to threefold compared to current practices in addition after supplemental irrigation of teff the excess water was used for dry season onion production of 7 66 t ha median across the watershed water harvesting resulted in a reduction in peak flows and an increase in low flows and it substantially reduced yield of sediment leaving the watershed dile et al 2016b temesgen et al 2012 introduced new ways of conservation tillage by involving contour ploughing and constructing invisible sub soil barriers using a traditional maresha winged sub soiler to curb problems of crop yield reduction soil erosion and water logging findings suggest that the experimentation on the new and traditional way of farming practices which were tested on wheat triticum vulgare and teff crops reduced soil erosion increased crop yield and enhanced the farming practices between soil conservation structures temesgen et al 2012 betrie et al 2011 implemented best management practices bmps and estimated their impacts on soil erosion the studied bmps were filter strips stone bunds and reforestation their results showed that significant reduction in sediment yield was observed both at the internal sub basins and basin outlets 3 4 4 impact of economic development there are various infrastructure projects which are already built as well as some that are planned in the upper blue nile basin for example the lake tana and beles regions are identified as among the five growth corridors in ethiopia that could help lift the population out of poverty and also contribute to overall economic growth in the country worldbank 2008 chara chara weir was built at the outlet of lake tana to regulate outflow from the lake for hydropower generation the tana beles inter basin water transfer project was completed in 2010 its purpose was to generate 460 mw hydropower canals are currently under construction to make use of the transferred water for irrigation the koga dam was built on koga river to store water to irrigate 6000 ha of land there are other planned irrigation schemes in the tana beles region that are meant to irrigate 60 000 ha of land alemayehu et al 2010 alemayehu et al 2010 used the weap model to simulate water demand for irrigation hydropower and downstream environmental flows under four plausible scenarios baseline ongoing development likely future development and full potential development they showed that if all the planned development occurs on average 2198 gwh year power could be generated 677 mm3 year of water supplied to irrigation schemes and the mean annual water level of lake tana may be lowered by 0 44 m the role of water in the co evolution of agricultural transformation and energy transition was illustrated for a number of development trajectories for the lake tana basin karlberg et al 2015 it was shown that water needed for energy and agricultural production sometimes exceeds water availability threatening the environmental sustainability of lake tana itself a stakeholder driven approach to intersectoral natural resources management underpinned by quantitative and spatially explicit scenario and planning tools can help to facilitate and strengthen cross sector dialogue thereby contributing to resolving dilemmas and supporting more consistent policy and decision making towards improved resource productivity lower environmental pressures and enhanced human security based on the abay basin integrated master plan adgolign et al 2015 developed three development scenarios current development 1999 2014 medium term development 2015 2030 and long term development 2031 2050 for the dedissa subbasin they assumed irrigated land areas of 9196 ha 132 668 ha and 189 870 ha for the current medium term and long term development scenarios respectively domestic water demand of 3 67 million cubic meters mcm year 6 97 mcm year and 15 57 mcm year were assumed for current mid term and long term development scenarios respectively hydropower generation of 300 mw was assumed only during the long term development scenario for these scenarios they analyzed whether the water demands for the different sectors were satisfied and whether the instream flow requirements were met they found that by the end of the long term scenario there will be a 10 annual flow volume reduction on the didessa river moreover some of the schemes inside the didessa watershed may have unmet demands in the last years of the scenarios however the instream flow requirement will be fully delivered at the outlet of the didessa river ensuring a sufficient amount of clean water is recognized as key for sustainable economic development un 2015 however in the upper blue nile basin there are more than 10 6 and 0 3 million people in rural and urban areas respectively who do not have access to a domestic water supply bceom 1998 in areas with access to water the water use is 30 l per capita per day lpcd in urban areas and 15 lpcd in rural areas bceom 1998 which is far less than the international standard the world health organization who 2003 recommends between 50 and 100 lpcd to meet basic needs similarly 12 and 0 6 million people do not have access to sanitary latrine in rural and urban areas respectively improvement of the water supply and sanitation coverage has not met the challenges of population pressure urbanization and climate change water supply and the sanitation sector can be improved if appropriate policy and institutional frameworks are properly combined bceom 1998 recently the construction of the grand ethiopian renaissance dam gerd has been raising public and scientific debate in the upper blue nile basin riparian countries ethiopia built this dam to reduce energy scarcity in the country ren21 2013 and support economic development and the transformation agenda mofed 2010 while the economic benefits of gerd to ethiopia are widely recognized e g chen and swain 2014 reservoir siltation remains a critical concern due to a severe soil erosion problem in the upper blue nile basin e g betrie et al 2011 egypt is concerned that the construction of gerd may reduce its water supply while sudan hopes that the dam will prevent flooding and siltation problems and also regulate river flow chen and swain 2014 mulat and moges 2014 studied the impacts of the gerd on the performance of the high aswan dam had in egypt during filling assumed 6 years period and operational phases using the mike basin river basin simulation model their findings showed that during the filling period of the gerd reservoir current irrigation water demands from had would be slightly impacted while annual energy output from the had would be reduced by 12 and 7 during the filling and operation phases respectively mulat and moges 2014 kahsay et al 2015 used a multi region multi sector computable general equilibrium modeling framework to assess the direct and indirect economic impacts of the gerd on ethiopia sudan and egypt they suggested that gerd may result in positive economic growth in ethiopia 5 5 and sudan 0 5 during the impounding phase while egypt may incur economic costs especially if a sequence of dry years occur and if sudan extracts a substantial amount of water for various purposes however after it becomes operational the gerd would generate substantial economic benefits that will enhance economic growth and welfare in all three countries kahsay et al 2015 another study by habteyes et al 2015 developed a dynamic optimization model that allows to identify opportunities for pareto improving measures to operate the gerd and aswan high dam for ethiopia south sudan sudan and egypt their findings suggested that ethiopia will be better off and the other countries will not be negatively affected by the construction of the gerd the authors argue that the climate in the ethiopian highlands provides a better water storage environment than the currently used lake nasser in egypt moreover water storage facilities in ethiopia will reduce reservoir siltation problems and ensure a stabilized river flow to sudan therefore if ethiopia egypt and sudan build trust and develop a cooperative development path they can ensure regional economic development and peace chen and swain 2014 habteyes et al 2015 kahsay et al 2015 4 research gaps although considerable advances in water resources research have been observed in the basin numerous research gaps still exist for example several research projects have been done to assess the impact of land use change however land use change is a dynamic subject with various issues to be studied the same is true accounting soil data in hydrological models previous studies in the basin have been focused on a single discipline and lack an integrated approach sufficient field data have not been collected to extensively test hydrological models conceptual theories we will try to highlight some of these research gaps 4 1 land use dynamics not fully addressed land use studies using half a century of data shed some light on the effect of land use change on the hydrology of the upper blue nile basin gebrehiwot et al 2013b although fluctuation in rainfall could explain some of those changes more information and research are needed to further advance the understanding of the complex relationship between forest and streamflow in the temporal dimension factors that contribute to the complex relationship between forests and flow include errors in measuring extreme flows different types of forest cover changes specific timing of forest impacts on flow dynamics between forest and flow relations and scale of forest impacts future studies of forest hydrology in the basin need to address sub watershed scales differences in watershed characteristics including vegetation types and hydrological processes that cause different forest types as forest change will continue in response to a range of drivers from economic drivers at the local level to environmental and climatic drivers on a global scale both short term financial growth and long term environmental impacts need to be addressed bonell 1998 the effect of changes in forest and other land use patterns on the flow regime needs monitoring especially in areas such as the upper blue nile basin where water availability during the dry season is an important factor for food security and the development potential of the region 4 2 soil a central but poorly represented system in water resources studies in the upper blue nile basin soil is one of the major geospatial characteristics that are used to describe a basin in most models since it significantly affects the water budget estimations however limitations on the availability of reliable soil parameter values and their spatial distribution makes it difficult to apply these models successfully for an improved simulation of the hydrological regime proper attention needs to be given to the soil information for the upper blue nile basin soil data including soil physical and chemical properties and their spatial distribution comes from different sources the most utilized soil maps for the region come from fao soil databases fao 1995 the ethiopian ministry of water resources mowr 2009 and the new harmonized world soil database fao et al 2009 the physiochemical properties have been compiled either from literature e g batjes 2002 betrie et al 2011 or by applying pedotransfer functions ptfs e g saxton and rawls 2006 using percent sand silt clay and bulk density for the soil type in the map pedotransfer function is an indirect method of estimating important soil hydraulic properties from easily available data such as soil textural size distribution bulk density and organic matter bouma and lanen 1987 the majority of published papers in the upper blue nile basin did not report detailed information about the soil data source quality and assumptions considered during model setup which makes it difficult to evaluate the accuracy of model estimations some papers provide little information about the soil data e g only the source of the data but not the range of calibrated soil parameters e g ali et al 2014 other papers reported calibrated parameter values but used unrealistic ranges for example soil available water capacity soil awc was multiplied by 1 62 gebremicael et al 2013 and by 1 25 koch and cherie 2013 such a wide range change of parameter values would undermine the physical meaning of the soil dataset and may represent a completely different watershed characteristic depending on the uncertainty of soil information in the region appropriate lower and upper bounds for these parameters needs to be produced similar observations of lack of proper attention to the land cover data were reported by van griensven et al 2012 contradictory reports are found in the literature regarding the effect of soil data resolution on the improvements in streamflow simulations some literature showed that resolution of soil data did not improve streamflow simulations e g boluwade and madramootoo 2013 ye et al 2011 whereas other literature indicated an improvement in streamflow prediction with improved soil data resolution e g sheshukov et al 2011 nevertheless the majority of research showed a difference in the hydrology when different soil data were used li et al 2012 found that difference in the spatial resolution of soil data resulted in a spatially varying output at the local scale however as these variabilities are aggregated throughout the watershed their effects would diminish and may not provide significant change at the catchment outlet similarly using the swat model boluwade and madramootoo 2013 concluded that having high resolution soil data may not mean an improvement in the model predictions despite the contradictory reports the importance of good soil information should not be underestimated the application of the modeling study should determine how detailed the geospatial dataset should be it is important to recognize that it is acceptable to have a lower goodness of fit criteria as long as the watershed characteristics are intact 4 3 limited research in identifying appropriate soil and water conservation measures intensive soil and water conservation activities have been implemented in ethiopia in general and in the upper blue nile basin in particular to mitigate soil loss however the adoption rate for these interventions has been considerably low mitiku et al 2006 this may be due to the questionable effectiveness of such interventions bayabil et al 2017 kassie et al 2011 attributed the mixed results regarding effectiveness of conservation measures to a one size fits all approach of addressing the problem which partly stems from a lack of detailed site specific studies needed for planning conservation measures many of the implemented soil and water conservation swc structures originated from the dust bowl era of the 1930 s in the united states reij et al 1996 these practices which effectively controlled erosion in the us were designed for undulating landscapes with rainfall on the order of 600 mm year irrespective of the fact that the prevailing landforms and hydrology were completely different from the locations where the practices were developed these practices were subsequently transplanted by practitioners and engineers to reduce erosion in other parts of the world hudson 1987 in contrast to the american midwest ethiopia is characterized by steep slopes and rainfall patterns that can yield 600 mm of rain in a single month in most cases the hydrology of runoff generation has not been considered for example steep slopes have been targeted for soil and water conservation practices while in reality most runoff and erosion may be produced on the lower slopes near the rivers and saturated valleys and gullies guzman et al 2013 steenhuis et al 2009 tilahun et al 2013a b in fact some research e g bewket and sterk 2003 zegeye et al 2011 has shown that mid and down slope areas lost more soil by rill erosion than upslope areas tebebu et al 2010 also showed that the water table height above the gully bottom and many natural water pipes were the main causes of the gully erosion processes in the debre mewi area near the lake tana subbasin this suggests that soil and water conservation structures that are suitable for the biophysical situation of the watersheds of the upper blue nile basin should be implemented hydrological modeling will be a valuable guide in identifying suitable areas for placing the soil and water conservation interventions as well as for estimating the effects of such interventions on the biophysical factors the research on identifying appropriate soil and water conservation measures should go hand in hand with the extension services the empirical evidence on the effectiveness of the identified soil and water conservation interventions should be adequately communicated to the farmers otherwise the farmers may have the tendency to reject the technologies due to cost and other factors amsalu and de graaff 2007 recommended that conservation interventions should focus not only on the biophysical performance but also on economic benefits that can be obtained at reasonable discount rates to enhance sustained use 4 4 lack of multidisciplinary water resource research most of the research in the upper blue nile basin is focused on a single discipline for example the majority of the hydrological models have been applied at various spatio temporal scales to estimate a single output e g streamflow at the outlet of a catchment while other applications estimate only a different output e g sediment loss there should be a search for a coupled model application that can predict multiple outcomes across multiple spatial and temporal scales in the basin for example the swat model provides multiple results however even in much of the published swat literature about the upper blue nile basin comprehensive results covering different disciplines were not reported cf van griensven et al 2012 therefore research in the upper blue nile basin should advance the traditional disciplinary approach to involving multiple disciplines barnes 2017 for example emphasis could be given in linking hydrology and soil erosion studies to other disciplines such as ecology the so called ecohydrology moore and heilman 2010 or socio economics 4 5 too little field data to support the modeling efforts little effort has been made in catchment modeling studies in the basin to use extensive field data for model calibration verification purposes or to test models conceptual theories typical catchment experimentation has been done only in limited locations e g anjeni andit tid awramba maybar and debre mawi catchments in fact studies from these catchments were used to generalize for the entire ethiopian highlands e g liu et al 2008 which requires caution field data collected from these catchments are not sufficient to support or reject any given model conceptualization since the data are solely based on the rainfall and runoff and making a generalization based on few experimentations is misleading thus future hydrological models should use additional orthogonal information for model calibration validation and or testing of hydrological theories fenicia et al 2008 winsemius et al 2009 5 recommendations 5 1 on data scarcity and quality since data collection processing documentation and dissemination require substantial financial logistical and time resources hrachowitz et al 2013 significant progress has not been made in the recent past in acquiring quality data in the upper blue nile basin while there has clearly been significant advancement in the global data revolution e g reanalysis satellite data etc the condition of many of the existing gauging stations in the upper blue nile basin is declining for example some of the gauging stations are malfunctioning and others are providing unreliable records due to deposit of debris in river gauging stations or presence of trees and other shadows on meteorological gauging stations furthermore efforts have not been made to increase the spatial density and temporal resolution of the hydro meteorological gauging stations for instance in most of the streamflow gauging stations measurements are taken at a daily time step however daily time step is too coarse to capture flood events in the headwater catchments due to the flashy characteristics of the rivers sediment aggradations and degradation are common features at the stream gauging stations in the headwater catchments however the rating curves both for flow and sediments are rarely updated in the majority of the gauged stations we therefore suggest an increase in the network of hydro metrological gauging stations at different key locations for example putting meteorological gauging stations at the top of mountains existing hydro meteorological gauging stations should be properly maintained and their standards should be improved likewise the rating curves for the river gauging stations should be updated within a reasonable time period we foresee that the remaining data gaps can be bridged with field data collection and remote sensing products 5 2 on the value of field data for improving process understanding field data collection can provide crucial insights for better understanding the hydrological processes at different temporal and spatial scales thus collecting detailed information from experimental catchments would help to understand how and when both surface and sub surface runoff processes are taking place for example monitoring the groundwater level in the hill slopes plateaus and riparian zones would help with understanding of the groundwater dynamics detty and mcguire 2010 mcglynn 2004 tracer experiments can provide additional information to advance the understating of hydrological processes for example tracer data integrated with catchment modeling can be used to separate time and geographic area based runoff components of catchments mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 seibert and mcdonnell 2002 moreover collecting runoff in a nested catchment approach piezometeric levels soil moisture and tracer dynamics data can help to gain better insight in process understanding 5 3 on improving soil data quality unreliability of soil parameter values could arise from the use of pedotransfer functions developed for other areas without considering their suitability for soils in the upper blue nile basin likewise the spatial resolution issue is due to limitations of field observations these limitations would affect the reliability of model simulation outputs depending on the applications of the study we encourage identifying appropriate pedotransfer functions that are suitable for the study areas and also having field observations to resolve low spatial resolution issues in fact there is significant progress towards improving soil data availability and quality for ethiopia in particular and africa in general for improved agronomic hydrological and other applications for example berhanu et al 2013 created an improved spatial soil database at the scale of 1 250 000 for the whole of ethiopia they compiled data from various sources and used the rawls et al 1982 table to assign soil hydraulic properties clustered by soil textural classes the map has a potential for improvement by considering percent sand silt and clay and other easily available measurements instead of textural classes and by utilizing better pedotransfer function that would work better for soils in the region the ethiopian soil information service ethiosis has been collecting intensive soil samples since 2012 ethiosis 2015 as of 2015 isric world soil information released soil data for the conterminous africa at a 250 m grid size for each grid soil parameters that are frequently used for water resources research are provided at six depths 0 5 cm 5 15 cm 15 30 cm 30 60 cm 60 100 cm and 100 200 cm these maps were created by combining soil data from more than 28 000 sampling locations locations from ethiosis were part of this with various environmental covariates hengl et al 2015 such a dataset has a significant potential to improve water resources studies in the region the point datasets will also help to create improved pedotransfer functions that are applicable for soils in the region some of the research ventures concerning the upper blue nile basin were multi million dollar projects e g the nile hydro solidarity project which is funded by the dutch foundation for the advancement of tropical research wotro the swedish research council grant water resources to build social ecological resilience the peer science program of usaid the water land and ecosystem wle program of cgiar etc we suggest that researchers should document details on geospatial data preparation as well as their methods of quality control and quality check similarly funding agencies should produce guidelines about geospatial data handling and sharing data should be the major deliverables of funded projects the spatial and tabular soil information created by one research group needs to be easily accessible for others to use it or detailed information should be provided about the steps followed to create the data for others to replicate it 5 4 remote sensing a promising tool for further data acquisitions as we have witnessed collecting representative spatial and temporal data for water resources modeling is expensive and challenging advances in remote sensing capabilities help researchers to collect such data for watershed scale modeling e g cheema et al 2011 kerr et al 2012 parajka et al 2008 the use of precipitation duan and bastiaanssen 2013 haile 2010 romilly and gebremichael 2011 worqlul et al 2018 2014 soil moisture bitar et al 2012 calvet et al 2007 jackson et al 2012 kerr et al 2012 and evaporation e g bastiaanssen et al 1998 mu et al 2011 su 2002 data for calibrating and validating hydrological models in the upper blue nile basin could help offset the existing data gaps nevertheless the use of remote sensing products to represent the water budget components requires pre validation of the products with ground based measurements a recommended threefold approach in the use of remotely sensed data includes validating the products using them in lieu of field measured data to trigger a hydrologic model and evaluating the uncertainties arising from using these products 5 5 putting the research into practice substantial research has been done in the upper blue nile basin however the ethiopian government has not sufficiently implemented these research outputs into practice for example most of the research stations were abandoned when the research programs were completed an exception to this is the scrp research program institut and hurni 1982 where its experimental research stations become part of the amhara region agricultural research institute arari other government institutions and or universities should follow suit by instituting such field research experimental stations moreover most of the published research outcomes have not been effectively utilized in policy and decision making processes these research activities involve multimillion dollar investments and most of them are tailored to development needs of the country if the findings from all of this research are used to inform the government s policy and practice they may invaluably support its development and transformation agenda 6 conclusions significant advances have been observed in water resources research in the upper blue nile basin the research advanced from estimating surface runoff using rainfall data to estimating other biophysical parameters such as soil erosion crop yield and impacts of land management interventions using advanced physically based models limitations on the quality and quantity of the data are reported as serious challenges on the other hand attempts have been made to bridge data gaps through field data collection and remote sensing this review article identified research gaps and recommended insights that could improve the water resources research in the basin for sustainable water resources management we indeed witness progress in water resources research in the upper blue nile basin however we believe there is opportunity for further advancement the research achievements can substantially support the ethiopian government s

7352,with ignorance and potential surprise dominating decision making in water resources a framework for dealing with such uncertainty is a critical need in hydrology we operationalize the potential surprise criterion proposed by shackle vickers and katzner svk to derive decision rules to manage water resources under uncertainty and ignorance we apply this framework to managing water supply systems in bangladesh that face severe naturally occurring arsenic contamination the uncertainty involved with arsenic in water supplies makes the application of conventional analysis of decision making ineffective given the uncertainty and surprise involved in such cases we find that optimal decisions tend to favor actions that avoid irreversible outcomes instead of conventional cost effective actions we observe that a diversification of the water supply system also emerges as a robust strategy to avert unintended outcomes of water contamination shallow wells had a slight higher optimal level 36 compare to deep wells and surface treatment which had allocation levels of roughly 32 under each the approach can be applied in a variety of other cases that involve decision making under uncertainty and surprise a frequent situation in natural resources management keywords water resource management arsenic contamination decisionmaking uncertainty shackle vickers and katzner svk criterion bangladesh 1 introduction uncertainty is pervasive in water resources and addressing uncertainty and ignorance still demands a more pragmatic approach in decision making ganguly et al 2015 hollings 1986 kalman 1983 water resources management often deals an inherent uncertainty in hydrologic processes borgomeo et al 2014 especially in information access infrastructure hydrologic modeling and decision making under extreme events uncertainties in climate change impacts water quantity floods and droughts water quality emerging contaminants eutrophication and social processes communication and response dominate research and decision making in water resources knowledge of uncertainty is important for robust management of water resources in order to sustain societies tracy 2008 in decision making risk probabilities and outcomes are all known and uncertainty probabilities are unknown but outcomes are known faber et al 1992 dominate in water resource management in many decisions neither probabilities nor outcomes are clearly known thus ignorance and surprise is often predominant in decision making while earlier theoretical works have made substantial progress in utilizing the probability information and nature of preferences through approaches like the expected utility theory the shortcomings of such frameworks are tucked in its assumptions or in the complacency of the large number theory these models use assumptions on complete information about water resource risk and have the advantage of elegance and simplicity but are less applicable to decision making under uncertainty and ignorance that is prevalent in water resources several distinguished economists hayek 1945 hicks 1976 shackle 1972 vickers 1985 have recognized this fact in analyzing uncertain choices and decisions metlay and sarewitz 2012 identify that such decision strategies are complex messy problems having i a high degree of uncertainty linking options to outcomes and ii substantial controversy over tradeoffs among values the quantification of probabilities of future outcomes in water resources is often constrained by the unavailability or lack of information leading to outcomes with potential for surprises shackle 1969 identifies that instances of surprise arise from the possibility of unknown outcomes the non replicability of frequency based probabilistic outcomes and insufficient knowledge of future outcomes in many cases the existing scientific knowledge cannot adequately explain the system dynamics to generate information for decisions with certainty uncertainty and surprise also exist with respect to the sustainable use and potential future benefits derived from water resource systems incorporating uncertainty into water resource decision making models requires a clear specification of the nature and sources of uncertainty given that a probability based framework has limited application in such situations involving uncertainty there is a need for alternative approaches and theories that will guide water resource decision making under uncertainty baudry 2018 starmer 2000 following the work of shackle 1969 vickers 1987 and katzner 1998 we propose an alternative framework for decision making under uncertainty and ignorance and apply it to a pragmatic case of managing water supply systems under uncertainty in bangladesh we incorporate non probabilistic uncertainty and surprise in decision making to deal with the exogenous uncertainty in water supplies our general objective is to derive and apply a framework that can guide prudent decision making in such cases bangladesh like many other developing nations faces an exceptionally high level of arsenic contamination in its groundwater which is leading to serious public health hazards smith et al 2000 the existing scientific knowledge is limited on managing arsenic contamination yunus et al 2016 tsur and zemel 1995 tsur and zemel 2004 and this study fills this gap by developing a unique operational approach to deal with water resource uncertainty another unique contribution is that very few studies e g horan et al 2002 mention the svk framework as a possible option to model uncertainty and surprise but do not provide an operational framework our study is thus unique in developing an operational framework to apply the svk approach and apply it to a water resource management problem specific objectives of this study are i to review current and develop an uncertainty framework for applications in water resource decisions ii to optimize decisions on water supplies under uncertain contamination processes iii to identify strategies to apply uncertainty into decision models in hydrology and water resource management we hypothesize that i the svk uncertainty framework is suited under conditions of ignorance and potential surprise ii diversified allocation is optimal for reducing uncertainty in water supply decisions and iii there is potential to improve decisions involving uncertainty in water resource management 2 towards an operational framework hydrology has recognized the importance of nonstationarity in planning and decision making milly et al 2008 borgomeo et al 2014 many policy decisions are also required to recognize the competing uses of water resources decisions often aim at avoiding risk and are made under a high degree of uncertainty arrow 2004 the commonly used expected utility eu approach assigns a numerical payoff value and a probability of state contingent outcomes of decisions however in practice decision makers are unwilling to apply expected utility methods to important decision problems moskowitz 1990 moskowitz et al 1993 several alternative theoretical frameworks are proposed that include reliability theory heiner 1983 milon and bogess 1988 bayesian optimization zhang et al 2017 robust interactive decision analysis chu et al 1989 moskowitz et al 1990 potential surprise framework shackle 1969

inconsistent with predictions made about people s behavior starmer 2000 inefficient in modeling under low catastrophic risk chichilnisky 1998 and is weak in applicability to natural resource management chisholm 1988 woodward and shaw 2006 peterson et al 2003 brock and xapapadeus 2003 suggested incorporating knightian uncertainty knight 1921 to regulate natural systems with non linear dynamics decision making under uncertainty facing irreversible changes also use concepts of option value weisbrod 1951 chisholm 1988 cicchetti and freeman 1971 quasi option value arrow and fisher 1974 and existence value the shackle s model of decision making under non probabilistic uncertainty and surprise shackle 1969 has not been adequately extended for use in practice of decision making vickers 1994 and katzner 1998 have made considerable effort to extend shackle s basic approach to theorize decisions under uncertain environments 3 methodology svk uncertainty framework consider a situation where a decision maker is ignorant in developing a full assessment of probabilities this difficulty often results from poor information an imperfect perception of past and present and unknown future this is a scenario with a lack of knowledge of occurrence outcome or the basis for probabilities epistemic nature hence a probability p e of the subset of states e is difficult to assert the lack of reliable estimates of p e makes the decision making more difficult under uncertainty compared to that of decisions under risk in the classic knightian sense following shackle 1969 vickers 1994 and katzner 1998 svk we assume that the decision maker imagines an incomplete collection of states of the world say ω and forms a non probabilistic judgment of belief of the occurrence of various states the states of e are subsets of ω with unknown states represented by the empty set ϕ in general consider only the σ field over ω that contains all subsets of ω katzner 1998 and represent it as ε in contrast to the states of e in the kolmogorov formulation tikhomirov 1993 of probability analysis the cox formulation cox 1961 of probability defines e as representing hypotheses propositions or a set of answers to questions the residual hypothesis is a collection of unknowns represented by the null set ϕ katzner 1998 according to svk the potential surprise of e in ε is the surprise the decision maker imagines now about the future occurrence of an element in e this can also be interpreted as the degree of disbelief when contemplating the possible occurrence of e katzner 1998 with this definition of surprise we can define a potential surprise function of e as s e 0 1 a mapping of ε into a closed interval when s e 0 for some e in ε this indicates perfect possibility i e the decision maker is unable to identify any obstacle to the occurrence of an element in e on the contrary when s e 1 the decision maker believes in perfect impossibility in the sense that it is not possible to conceive of an element of e occurring at s ϕ 0 the decision maker expresses a perfect possibility of occurrence of something not imagined a priori following the svk approach the s e is defined to satisfy three axioms firstly the range of s e is represented by axiom 1 1 for all e in ε 0 s e 1 which is a standard condition similar to the property of a probability function this indicates that the surprise function is nonnegative and bounded above by unity equivalent to perfect impossibility secondly axiom in 2 represents that the surprise of the union of all sets is equal to the least of all surprise functions 2 for any e i e i ε s i e i inf i s e this axiom is a counterpart of the additivity and mutual disjointness of ei in probability axioms replaced by inf and nonempty ei this is an important distinction from probability theory where the surprise function does not follow traditionally defined distribution and density functions associated with probability theory katzner 1998 the third axiom is that if e i is an exhaustive set of rival hypotheses then s e i 0 for at least one i this signifies that there is always some hypothesis that carries zero potential surprise in using the shacklean concepts for decision making the two components complete collection of states and probability function are replaced by incomplete collection ω and the surprise function s e for decision x x define a utility function u x ω that is defined by x ω that depends on decision choices and the state ω of the world to reduce preference ordering of u x ω to a single function of x for decision making shackle 1969 introduced an ascendancy function which was replaced by attractiveness function by vickers 1987 to derive the attractiveness function a subset of ψ is defined as n x s that consists of perfectly possible outcomes as n x s ψ f x s ψ 0 this set represents a situation where the decision maker is unable to perceive a hindrance to its occurrence then identify some elements of n x s say ψ x s to distinguish potential gain spaces and loss spaces potential gain spaces are defined as 3 and the potential loss spaces are defined as 4 3 ψ x ψ ψ ψ x s 4 ψ x ψ ψ ψ x s such that ψ x ψ x ψ x s we use ξ to denote potential surprise values over a range e such that ξ f x s ψ where ξ 0 1 given this framework each pair of ψ ξ has an attractiveness to the decision maker associated with decision x the decision maker s objective is to select x x on pairs of ψ ξ in psi x e and ψ x e that have maximum attractiveness subject to the potential surprise density function fig 1 if attractiveness is measured in ordinal terms as real numbers then denote it as g x s that map ψ x e and ψ x e into a real line the optimal solutions are where iso attractiveness contours are tangential to the potential density curve the optimization problem is to maxg x s ψ ξ subject to ξ f x s ψ substituting the constraint into the objective function one can derive h ψ to rewrite the problem as 5 5 max h ψ ψ g x s ψ f x s ψ the first order conditions for optima can be derived as 6 6 dh d ψ g x s ψ g x s f x s f x s ψ and solving for dh d ψ 0 one could obtain 7 7 dg x s d ψ g x s f x s f x s ψ 0 rearranging and evaluating at the maximizing pairs of ψ x ξ x or ψ x ξ x one can obtain the first order condition for optimality as 8 8 g x s ψ g x s f x s f x s ψ in translating this to decision making the possible range of utility outcomes are considered by a typical decision maker to account for the values in the focus gain and focus loss spaces that is for x x a decision maker looks at specific values in focus gain r x and r x and focus loss l x and l x spaces the x with higher r x value is of higher utility in the focus gain space and is preferred while a higher r x is more uncertain and is thus less desirable in this space an x with higher l x value is less negative and is desirable while that with higher l x makes the lowest utility value more surprising and thus less desirable thus there are tradeoffs between each of the pairs of these four functions these tradeoffs are addressed by a general function q s x that has four arguments 1 the highest potential return in the gain space 2 the highest potential return in the loss space 3 the lowest potential surprise in the gain space and 4 the lowest potential surprise in the loss space the decision maker combines these in a function defined for all values of ψ x ψ x σ 2 x σ 2 x arising from a constrained maximization of the attractiveness function and is represented as q s ψ x ψ x σ 2 x σ 2 x from the constrained optimization problem it is expected that q s x ψ x 0 q s x ψ x 0 q s x ξ x 0 and q s x ξ x 0 this result is because the potential return in loss space comes with a negative sign and attractiveness increases when ψ x increases less negative in general attractiveness also increases when the potential return ψ x increases however greater potential surprise in the gain space is less attractive but it is more attractive in the loss space because it is less likely to occur for an unconditional uncertainty averse decision maker q s x ξ x 0 q s x ξ x 0 as the unconditional uncertainty averse decision maker wants to reduce potential surprise in both gain and loss pace however for an unconditional uncertainty neutral decision maker q s x ξ x 0 q s x ξ x 0 the signs of these derivatives by themselves may not be sufficient to rank alternatives the decision maker then forms a decision index or decision function that is defined on x by replacing the functional value arguments of q s x with their associated functions and represented as in 9 katzner 1998 9 d s x q s l x l x r x r x the decision index is distinct from the attractiveness function because it is derived from different cognitive process while attractiveness function emerges from identification of what is positive or alarming about various objectives of choice katzner 1998 this formulation is similar to that of a multi attribute utility function keeney and raiffa 1976 randhir and shriver 2009 with attributes representing attractiveness and surprise levels in focus gain and focus loss spaces the decision maker can maximize d s x over a subset of x with budgetary restrictions for deriving a unique optima 3 1 study area an exceptionally high level of arsenic is found in groundwater in bangladesh prior to the 1970s the people in bangladesh mostly relied on surface water which has become increasingly polluted pollution from poor sewage systems and chemical waste dumping has led to cholera diarrhea and other water borne diseases the mortality rates from such water borne diseases were alarming the government and donor agencies suggested the cost effective solution of digging shallow tube wells to provide access to safe water patel 2001 millions of dollars were spent on digging shallow tube wells and massive pumping of groundwater took place to meet household and agricultural demand by 2000 almost 97 of the populations in rural bangladesh were drinking water from shallow tube wells and 2 5 to 3 million wells existed in bangladesh patel 2001 initially no one was warned to test for arsenic in the early 1990s it was found that most of the well water contained arsenic the current method of extracting water cannot be continued as arsenic is causing serious health hazards and leading to the largest mass poisoning in history smith et al 2000 more than 29 million people are affected by arsenic contamination and 35 77 million are at risk of exposure in bangladesh rahman 2002 due to arsenic related cancers in liver bladder and lung chen and ahsan 2004 estimate a more than doubling of lifetime mortality risk 229 6 versus 103 5 per 100 000 population in bangladesh the evidence of fetal loss and infant death due to arsenic exposure during pregnancy has been documented by rahman et al 2007 maddison et al 2005 have estimated that the aggregate willingness to pay wtp to avoid the health impacts of arsenic in bangladesh is 2 7 billion year given the uncertainty involved in this specific water resource management case the application of conventional cost benefit analysis would be inadequate in this paper we attempt to design an analytical framework for future decision making and mitigation measures for similar situations of uncertainty most of the large arsenic contamination worldwide involves groundwater contamination as a natural outcome of hydro geological process see table 1 for details on worldwide occurrences of arsenic contamination in water there is an intense debate regarding the causes of arsenic contamination in bangladesh a country abundant in both surface and ground water see science 22 november 2002 and science 25 april 2003 for a debate regarding the causes of arsenic contamination in bangladesh a variety of factors such as geology hydrology and the structure of aquifers can be attributed to the causes of contamination arsenic is naturally transported in the river systems in bangladesh and adsorbed into fine grained iron or manganese oxyhydroxides these ores were deposited in floodplains and buried in the sedimentary column which later released arsenic into groundwater in certain parts of bangladesh see rahman 2002 most of the highly arsenic contaminated wells are in shallow aquifers that are 50 to 150 feet below the surface whereas deep aquifers are nearly arsenic free yu et al 2003 however it uncertain whether deep aquifers will remain arsenic free over time an alternative view is that distribution of arsenic is related to geology rather than depth since arsenic is in aquifers with newer sediments the complexity in sediment dynamics and a dearth of sediment analyses make it difficult to predict whether the high arsenic zone is hydrologically separate from deep aquifers a study on natural arsenic distribution in socorro new mexico brandvold and frisch 2002 shows that the relationship between rock type and arsenic concentration in water is not well defined in this study area in west bengal india mukherjee 2005 finds no significant relationship between depth and arsenic concentration in the sedimentary sequences to apply conventional groundwater modeling to locate arsenic free sites while answers to the questions regarding the causes of arsenic contamination in bangladesh are yet to be known with certainty it is important to acknowledge the uncertainty and surprise potential involved in policy and decision making regarding ground water extraction we apply the svk framework in decision making under environmental uncertainty associated with management of water resources the uncertainty and surprise are related to the surprise associated with the quality of various sources of water our focus is on arsenic contamination of drinking water in bangladesh to be justified for analysis based on a non expected utility framework woodward and shaw 2006 portray arsenic in drinking water as a situation where relevant probabilities are very small and the ambiguity related to outcomes due to lack of information have important health implications including mortality and morbidity thus the behavioral anomalies that people place more weight on low probability events in gain space and less weight on low probability events in loss space and also show preference towards ambiguity aversion will have significant consequences in decision making in case of arsenic contamination optimization model to apply the svk framework to this decision problem we consider a decision maker water manager who is facing uncertainty in arsenic contamination of new water sources that are being developed the water manager is considering three alternatives in his choice set that include shallow wells sw deep wells dw and surface water treatment swt let i i denote each of these sources where i sw dw swt the uncertainty involved in all these options is associated with water contamination exceeding a safety threshold long after the water supply has been developed fig 2 shows these three options for water collection with corresponding potential outcomes let b be a non empty subset of the real line b i b i 0 1 such that there is a 1 1 correspondence γ i between the decision set x i and the real line b i this can be expressed as b i γ i x i for all x i x i and b i b i let a decision maker water manager hold a belief as the potential surprise density function f i ψ b of a particular source i as 10 10 f i ψ i b i ϕ i ifb i 1 ψ i ϕ i k g i ψ i b i 2 ifb ψ i b 1 0 if 1 b i ψ i b i ϕ i k l i ψ i 1 b i 2 ifb i ψ i b i 1 ϕ i if ψ 1 b i 1 here ϕ i 0 1 represents a scaling factor to model the reduction in surprise resulting from treatment technologies the constants k g i and k l i g stands for the gain space and l for the loss space are marginal scaling coefficients representing increased or decreased surprise potential at the margin for each outcome of a decision in the gain space ψ x and loss space ψ x respectively the lower bound say b 0 i of b i represents the boundary between more favorable ψ i f ψ i b i 0 and less favorable outcomes ψ i f ψ i b i 1 this formulation also defines various endpoints of intervals through which ψ i vary let g i ψ i ξ i be the attractiveness function of the decision maker to a particular source for water augmentation represented as 11 11 g i ψ i ξ i α g i ψ i β g i ξ i if ψ x α l i ψ i β l i ξ i if ψ x here α g i and α l i are marginal attractiveness for the outcomes resulting from a decision in gain space and loss space respectively similarly β g i and β l i are marginal attractiveness repulsion for increases in surprise levels in the gain space and loss space respectively to identify optimal conditions in the gain spaces and loss spaces for each i a constrained maximization of g i ψ i ξ i subject to f i ψ i b i can be specified using the lagrangean theorem at interior points of focus loss and focus gain spaces it is easier to identify attractiveness maximizing pairs in focus gain and focus loss for b i b i the optimal tangency points are identified using dg i ψ i ξ i df i ψ i b i 0 in focus gain and focus loss spaces for each i i thus ψ g i ψ l i ξ g i and ξ l i are coordinates of the tangency between the iso attractiveness function g i ψ i ξ i and the potential surprise density function f i ψ i b i fig 3 shows these tangency points for three different options sw dw swt to develop water supply systems these coordinates are functions of b i that can be used in the development of a decision index d b i defined as 12 d b i q ψ g i ψ l i ξ g i ξ l i i i this decision index d b i is a function of b i obtained by substituting constrained maximization solution values in focus loss and focus gain spaces into q ψ g i ψ l i ξ g i ξ l i a continuously differential function katzner 1998 this index could be optimized to identify optimal b i that maximizes the combined attractiveness in the focus gain and focus loss spaces of all choice alternatives the parameters applied in our analysis are listed in table 2 these parameters are based on insights from published information on water resources in the bangladesh region our experience in water management in the region and the nature of hydrologic processes in relation to water supplies maddison et al 2005 mukherjee 2005 khan and haque 2010 khan et al 2014 the values of each parameter are discussed in detail in the following discussion the b 0 i value is the lower bound of b i that represents the boundary between more favorable and less favorable outcomes this boundary determines the threshold interval where the potential surprise increases the potential surprise for deep wells dw could be set at earlier levels of b dw as compared to sw and swt this threshold is set at b 0 dw 0 15 a higher threshold in sw is set at b 0 sw 0 3 representing a delay before one could start observing surprises this observation is consistent with the history of contamination of shallow wells observed in bangladesh the surprise associated with surface water treatment swt is much later than the other choice categories and is set at b 0 swt 0 4 representing potential surprises that occur with larger allocations resulting from plant malfunctions unknown health effects capacity obsoleteness and spikes in contamination during extreme flood events which are common in bangladesh the ϕ i parameter scales the potential surprise function for sw and dw this is set at unity indicating surprises reaching the maximum possible levels derived from the belief that these two options are driven by hydrologic process that are difficult to predict ex ante to a decision the ϕ i value for swt is relatively lower 20 compared to sw and dw in the belief that a treatment process is controllable and within the management ability before substantial changes in concentrations are seen the k g i parameter is the coefficient that increases the marginal change in the surprise in the quadratic form as 11 13 df i ψ i b i dx 2 k g i k g i b i with b ψ i b 1 the values for each i are based on the increase in surprise potential for increased levels of the activity the parameter values use relative levels in the belief that a marginal increase in surprise potential in dw is 81 of that of the marginal increase in sw this value is based on the relatively higher uncertainty and expected surprise in installing deep well compared to that of shallow well the k g swt value is higher indicating a higher increase in marginal surprises involved in treatment malfunction the k l i value reflects the marginal decrease in surprise potential in the loss spaces and can be interpreted similarly to that of k g i in the gain spaces the attractiveness function g i ψ i ξ i is specified as a linear function with marginal coefficients α g i α l i β g i β l i representing incremental attractiveness for each marginal change in the focus gain and focus loss spaces the coefficient α g i represents the marginal increase in attractiveness in a higher outcome while β g i is the marginal increase from reduction in surprise potential in the focus gain space similarly α l i and β l i are marginal changes in attractiveness from a reduction in loss of outcome and reduction of surprise in the focus loss space we assume that the water manager is indifferent to different sources of water with regard to tastes and some other likely attributes that do not impose any significant treatment cost the functions in the focus loss and focus gain spaces were simulated in mathcad software mathsoft 2006 using the parameter set described above and presented in fig 4 the optimal conditions of the constrained maximization related to the parameter set are listed in table 3 these optimal conditions are used additively in building the decision function d b i of the decision maker a second optimization was conducted to maximize d b i subject to additional restrictions on the boundaries of b i and a budgetary condition of the decision problem this can be represented as 14 max b i d b i s t i c i b i b and b 0 i b i 1 where c i is the relative cost of developing the water source and b is the total budget constraint the estimates for c i are based on ahmed 2005 and were normalized for relative costs using sw as a numeraire for optimization this decision problem was specified and solved using the gams optimization software brooke et al 1998 to identify optimal allocation of the water supply by the water manager 4 results and discussion since typical cost benefit analysis precludes addressing these types of situations we apply the potential surprise criterion to develop decision rules to manage natural resources under uncertainty in our analysis we assign a realistic pay off structure with intuitive beliefs regarding various uncertain events the prime focus is to operationalize the concept of potential surprise criterion by applying it to a practical problem that water utilities face to maintain robust supply of water based on the parameters used the optimal choice for the water manager is to build the capacity to collect 36 2 of total water allocation from sw shallow well 32 6 from dw deep well and 31 2 from swt surface water treatment our findings imply that a diversified allocation strategy which is often effective under risky situations may also be applicable to situations under uncertainty and surprise thus using the svk approach in an operational framework in the context of arsenic contamination in bangladesh we show that a diversified approach to developing water supply systems is the optimal choice under uncertainty and surprise this is consistent with risk and uncertainty literature in identifying the role of diversity in allocation to minimize overall risk in decisions there is excellent potential for using multiobjective optimization using genetic algorithms in water resource studies tanyimboh and czajkowska 2017 used penalty free genetic algorithms to model water distribution networks al jawad and tanyimboh 2017 used an evolutionary algorithm to model reservoir operations rathnayake and tanyimboh 2015 use evolutionary algorithms in control of combined sewer overflows the focus on svk operationalize uncertainty framework and could be used in characterizing uncertain outcomes in optimization studies decision making under uncertainty and surprise is an issue of critical concern in water resource management however a very limited number of studies attempt to model uncertainty and surprise explicitly in the core decision making process more specifically in case of water management system managers often face uncertainty in maintaining both the desired quantity and quality of water supplies planners and system managers often struggle with the complexity of the system dynamics which provide water for daily use the complexity of system dynamics is much more prominent in underground sources of water compared to surface sources thus uncertainty and elements of potential surprise in decision making are important for water resource management in recent years arsenic contamination has become one of the high priority environmental issues due to public health concerns management of contaminated water resources is also a challenge to developed countries such as in the u s because of prohibitive remediation costs nrc 1994 budget constraints are much more severe in developing countries and often depend on the flow of foreign aid for such projects the framework we develop is crucial to make decisions regarding water supplies under environmental uncertainty and surprise related to arsenic contamination 5 conclusion the framework we propose can be a very useful tool for utility managers who can incorporate subjective beliefs and expert opinions into the decision making process to develop a robust water supply system under potential surprise criterion the decision rule favors decisions involving low surprise and high net potential gain under unconditional uncertainty aversion thus a water manager can identify optimal allocation among water supply alternatives by considering values of surprise density and the attractiveness of each alternative in applying this framework in the bangladesh context we observe that a diversified allocation with shallow wells deep wells and surface water treatment can be the attractive policy choice in the face of uncertainty and surprise shallow wells had a slight higher optimal level 36 compare to deep wells and surface treatment which had levels of roughly 32 each the implication of the results for future policy design is that given the uncertainties and surprise involved in such cases the decisions should favor actions that minimize surprise instead of conventional cost effectiveness the diversification of the water supply system that emerges as a robust strategy to avert unintended outcomes is also along the line of evolutionary view of decision making under uncertainty which suggests actions leading to increasing diversity and adaptive flexibility rammel and van der bergh 2003 the potential surprise criterion can be extended to other applications by using relevant beliefs regarding surprise densities and attractiveness contours uncertainty and surprise is pervasive in natural resources management woodward and shaw 2006 and the potential surprise criterion can be extensively utilized in decision making in this area this approach is based on subjective beliefs and needs informed judgment and understanding of the resource system since the proposed framework is flexible to incorporate a wide range of uncertain beliefs deliberative expert elicitation of beliefs howarth and wilson 2006 can be used in collective decision making there is immense potential to extend this study to other contaminants especially nonpoint source pollution that is uncertain over geographic space and time there is a need for further research into elucidation of surprise potential and attractiveness functions further research could also focus on developing methods to evaluate tradeoffs and applicability of svk framework in decision making at multiple scales randhir 2016 applicability of this framework to uncertainty like decisions

7352,with ignorance and potential surprise dominating decision making in water resources a framework for dealing with such uncertainty is a critical need in hydrology we operationalize the potential surprise criterion proposed by shackle vickers and katzner svk to derive decision rules to manage water resources under uncertainty and ignorance we apply this framework to managing water supply systems in bangladesh that face severe naturally occurring arsenic contamination the uncertainty involved with arsenic in water supplies makes the application of conventional analysis of decision making ineffective given the uncertainty and surprise involved in such cases we find that optimal decisions tend to favor actions that avoid irreversible outcomes instead of conventional cost effective actions we observe that a diversification of the water supply system also emerges as a robust strategy to avert unintended outcomes of water contamination shallow wells had a slight higher optimal level 36 compare to deep wells and surface treatment which had allocation levels of roughly 32 under each the approach can be applied in a variety of other cases that involve decision making under uncertainty and surprise a frequent situation in natural resources management keywords water resource management arsenic contamination decisionmaking uncertainty shackle vickers and katzner svk criterion bangladesh 1 introduction uncertainty is pervasive in water resources and addressing uncertainty and ignorance still demands a more pragmatic approach in decision making ganguly et al 2015 hollings 1986 kalman 1983 water resources management often deals an inherent uncertainty in hydrologic processes borgomeo et al 2014 especially in information access infrastructure hydrologic modeling and decision making under extreme events uncertainties in climate change impacts water quantity floods and droughts water quality emerging contaminants eutrophication and social processes communication and response dominate research and decision making in water resources knowledge of uncertainty is important for robust management of water resources in order to sustain societies tracy 2008 in decision making risk probabilities and outcomes are all known and uncertainty probabilities are unknown but outcomes are known faber et al 1992 dominate in water resource management in many decisions neither probabilities nor outcomes are clearly known thus ignorance and surprise is often predominant in decision making while earlier theoretical works have made substantial progress in utilizing the probability information and nature of preferences through approaches like the expected utility theory the shortcomings of such frameworks are tucked in its assumptions or in the complacency of the large number theory these models use assumptions on complete information about water resource risk and have the advantage of elegance and simplicity but are less applicable to decision making under uncertainty and ignorance that is prevalent in water resources several distinguished economists hayek 1945 hicks 1976 shackle 1972 vickers 1985 have recognized this fact in analyzing uncertain choices and decisions metlay and sarewitz 2012 identify that such decision strategies are complex messy problems having i a high degree of uncertainty linking options to outcomes and ii substantial controversy over tradeoffs among values the quantification of probabilities of future outcomes in water resources is often constrained by the unavailability or lack of information leading to outcomes with potential for surprises shackle 1969 identifies that instances of surprise arise from the possibility of unknown outcomes the non replicability of frequency based probabilistic outcomes and insufficient knowledge of future outcomes in many cases the existing scientific knowledge cannot adequately explain the system dynamics to generate information for decisions with certainty uncertainty and surprise also exist with respect to the sustainable use and potential future benefits derived from water resource systems incorporating uncertainty into water resource decision making models requires a clear specification of the nature and sources of uncertainty given that a probability based framework has limited application in such situations involving uncertainty there is a need for alternative approaches and theories that will guide water resource decision making under uncertainty baudry 2018 starmer 2000 following the work of shackle 1969 vickers 1987 and katzner 1998 we propose an alternative framework for decision making under uncertainty and ignorance and apply it to a pragmatic case of managing water supply systems under uncertainty in bangladesh we incorporate non probabilistic uncertainty and surprise in decision making to deal with the exogenous uncertainty in water supplies our general objective is to derive and apply a framework that can guide prudent decision making in such cases bangladesh like many other developing nations faces an exceptionally high level of arsenic contamination in its groundwater which is leading to serious public health hazards smith et al 2000 the existing scientific knowledge is limited on managing arsenic contamination yunus et al 2016 tsur and zemel 1995 tsur and zemel 2004 and this study fills this gap by developing a unique operational approach to deal with water resource uncertainty another unique contribution is that very few studies e g horan et al 2002 mention the svk framework as a possible option to model uncertainty and surprise but do not provide an operational framework our study is thus unique in developing an operational framework to apply the svk approach and apply it to a water resource management problem specific objectives of this study are i to review current and develop an uncertainty framework for applications in water resource decisions ii to optimize decisions on water supplies under uncertain contamination processes iii to identify strategies to apply uncertainty into decision models in hydrology and water resource management we hypothesize that i the svk uncertainty framework is suited under conditions of ignorance and potential surprise ii diversified allocation is optimal for reducing uncertainty in water supply decisions and iii there is potential to improve decisions involving uncertainty in water resource management 2 towards an operational framework hydrology has recognized the importance of nonstationarity in planning and decision making milly et al 2008 borgomeo et al 2014 many policy decisions are also required to recognize the competing uses of water resources decisions often aim at avoiding risk and are made under a high degree of uncertainty arrow 2004 the commonly used expected utility eu approach assigns a numerical payoff value and a probability of state contingent outcomes of decisions however in practice decision makers are unwilling to apply expected utility methods to important decision problems moskowitz 1990 moskowitz et al 1993 several alternative theoretical frameworks are proposed that include reliability

dynamics decision making under uncertainty facing irreversible changes also use concepts of option value weisbrod 1951 chisholm 1988 cicchetti and freeman 1971 quasi option value arrow and fisher 1974 and existence value the shackle s model of decision making under non probabilistic uncertainty and surprise shackle 1969 has not been adequately extended for use in practice of decision making vickers 1994 and katzner 1998 have made considerable effort to extend shackle s basic approach to theorize decisions under uncertain environments 3 methodology svk uncertainty framework consider a situation where a decision maker is ignorant in developing a full assessment of probabilities this difficulty often results from poor information an imperfect perception of past and present and unknown future this is a scenario with a lack of knowledge of occurrence outcome or the basis for probabilities epistemic nature hence a probability p e of the subset of states e is difficult to assert the lack of reliable estimates of p e makes the decision making more difficult under uncertainty compared to that of decisions under risk in the classic knightian sense following shackle 1969 vickers 1994 and katzner 1998 svk we assume that the decision maker imagines an incomplete collection of states of the world say ω and forms a non probabilistic judgment of belief of the occurrence of various states the states of e are subsets of ω with unknown states represented by the empty set ϕ in general consider only the σ field over ω that contains all subsets of ω katzner 1998 and represent it as ε in contrast to the states of e in the kolmogorov formulation tikhomirov 1993 of probability analysis the cox formulation cox 1961 of probability defines e as representing hypotheses propositions or a set of answers to questions the residual hypothesis is a collection of unknowns represented by the null set ϕ katzner 1998 according to svk the potential surprise of e in ε is the surprise the decision maker imagines now about the future occurrence of an element in e this can also be interpreted as the degree of disbelief when contemplating the possible occurrence of e katzner 1998 with this definition of surprise we can define a potential surprise function of e as s e 0 1 a mapping of ε into a closed interval when s e 0 for some e in ε this indicates perfect possibility i e the decision maker is unable to identify any obstacle to the occurrence of an element in e on the contrary when s e 1 the decision maker believes in perfect impossibility in the sense that it is not possible to conceive of an element of e occurring at s ϕ 0 the decision maker expresses a perfect possibility of occurrence of something not imagined a priori following the svk approach the s e is defined to satisfy three axioms firstly the range of s e is represented by axiom 1 1 for all e in ε 0 s e 1 which is a standard condition similar to the property of a probability function this indicates that the surprise function is nonnegative and bounded above by unity equivalent to perfect impossibility secondly axiom in 2 represents that the surprise of the union of all sets is equal to the least of all surprise functions 2 for any e i e i ε s i e i inf i s e this axiom is a counterpart of the additivity and mutual disjointness of ei in probability axioms replaced by inf and nonempty ei this is an important distinction from probability theory where the surprise function does not follow traditionally defined distribution and density functions associated with probability theory katzner 1998 the third axiom is that if e i is an exhaustive set of rival hypotheses then s e i 0 for at least one i this signifies that there is always some hypothesis that carries zero potential surprise in using the shacklean concepts for decision making the two components complete collection of states and probability function are replaced by incomplete collection ω and the surprise function s e for decision x x define a utility function u x ω that is defined by x ω that depends on decision choices and the state ω of the world to reduce preference ordering of u x ω to a single function of x for decision making shackle 1969 introduced an ascendancy function which was replaced by attractiveness function by vickers 1987 to derive the attractiveness function a subset of ψ is defined as n x s that consists of perfectly possible outcomes as n x s ψ f x s ψ 0 this set represents a situation where the decision maker is unable to perceive a hindrance to its occurrence then identify some elements of n x s say ψ x s to distinguish potential gain spaces and loss spaces potential gain spaces are defined as 3 and the potential loss spaces are defined as 4 3 ψ x ψ ψ ψ x s 4 ψ x ψ ψ ψ x s such that ψ x ψ x ψ x s we use ξ to denote potential surprise values over a range e such that ξ f x s ψ where ξ 0 1 given this framework each pair of ψ ξ has an attractiveness to the decision maker associated with decision x the decision maker s objective is to select x x on pairs of ψ ξ in psi x e and ψ x e that have maximum attractiveness subject to the potential surprise density function fig 1 if attractiveness is measured in ordinal terms as real numbers then denote it as g x s that map ψ x e and ψ x e into a real line the optimal solutions are where iso attractiveness contours are tangential to the potential density curve the optimization problem is to maxg x s ψ ξ subject to ξ f x s ψ substituting the constraint into the objective function one can derive h ψ to rewrite the problem as 5 5 max h ψ ψ g x s ψ f x s ψ the first order conditions for optima can be derived as 6 6 dh d ψ g x s ψ g x s f x s f x s ψ and solving for dh d ψ 0 one could obtain 7 7 dg x s d ψ g x s f x s f x s ψ 0 rearranging and evaluating at the maximizing pairs of ψ x ξ x or ψ x ξ x one can obtain the first order condition for optimality as 8 8 g x s ψ g x s f x s f x s ψ in translating this to decision making the possible range of utility outcomes are considered by a typical decision maker to account for the values in the focus gain and focus loss spaces that is for x x a decision maker looks at specific values in focus gain r x and r x and focus loss l x and l x spaces the x with higher r x value is of higher utility in the focus gain space and is preferred while a higher r x is more uncertain and is thus less desirable in this space an x with higher l x value is less negative and is desirable while that with higher l x makes the lowest utility value more surprising and thus less desirable thus there are tradeoffs between each of the pairs of these four functions these tradeoffs are addressed by a general function q s x that has four arguments 1 the highest potential return in the gain space 2 the highest potential return in the loss space 3 the lowest potential surprise in the gain space and 4 the lowest potential surprise in the loss space the decision maker combines these in a function defined for all values of ψ x ψ x σ 2 x σ 2 x arising from a constrained maximization of the attractiveness function and is represented as q s ψ x ψ x σ 2 x σ 2 x from the constrained optimization problem it is expected that q s x ψ x 0 q s x ψ x 0 q s x ξ x 0 and q s x ξ x 0 this result is because the potential return in loss space comes with a negative sign and attractiveness increases when ψ x increases less negative in general attractiveness also increases when the potential return ψ x increases however greater potential surprise in the gain space is less attractive but it is more attractive in the loss space because it is less likely to occur for an unconditional uncertainty averse decision maker q s x ξ x 0 q s x ξ x 0 as the unconditional uncertainty averse decision maker wants to reduce potential surprise in both gain and loss pace however for an unconditional uncertainty neutral decision maker q s x ξ x 0 q s x ξ x 0 the signs of these derivatives by themselves may not be sufficient to rank alternatives the decision maker then forms a decision index or decision function that is defined on x by replacing the functional value arguments of q s x with their associated functions and represented as in 9 katzner 1998 9 d s x q s l x l x r x r x the decision index is distinct from the attractiveness function because it is derived from different cognitive process while attractiveness function emerges from identification of what is positive or alarming about various objectives of choice katzner 1998 this formulation is similar to that of a multi attribute utility function keeney and raiffa 1976 randhir and shriver 2009 with attributes representing attractiveness and surprise levels in focus gain and focus loss spaces the decision maker can maximize d s x over a subset of x with budgetary restrictions for deriving a unique optima 3 1 study area an exceptionally high level of arsenic is found in groundwater in bangladesh prior to the 1970s the people in bangladesh mostly relied on surface water which has become increasingly polluted pollution from poor sewage systems and chemical waste dumping has led to cholera diarrhea and other water borne diseases the mortality rates from such water borne diseases were alarming the government and donor agencies suggested the cost effective solution of digging shallow tube wells to provide access to safe water patel 2001 millions of dollars were spent on digging shallow tube wells and massive pumping of groundwater took place to meet household and agricultural demand by 2000 almost 97 of the populations in rural bangladesh were drinking water from shallow tube wells and 2 5 to 3 million wells existed in bangladesh patel 2001 initially no one was warned to test for arsenic in the early 1990s it was found that most of the well water contained arsenic the current method of extracting water cannot be continued as arsenic is causing serious health hazards and leading to the largest mass poisoning in history smith et al 2000 more than 29 million people are affected by arsenic contamination and 35 77 million are at risk of exposure in bangladesh rahman 2002 due to arsenic related cancers in liver bladder and lung chen and ahsan 2004 estimate a more than doubling of lifetime mortality risk 229 6 versus 103 5 per 100 000 population in bangladesh the evidence of fetal loss and infant death due to arsenic exposure during pregnancy has been documented by rahman et al 2007 maddison et al 2005 have estimated that the aggregate willingness to pay wtp to avoid the health impacts of arsenic in bangladesh is 2 7 billion year given the uncertainty involved in this specific water resource management case the application of conventional cost benefit analysis would be inadequate in this paper we attempt to design an analytical framework for future decision making and mitigation measures for similar situations of uncertainty most of the large arsenic contamination worldwide involves groundwater contamination as a natural outcome of hydro geological process see table 1 for details on worldwide occurrences of arsenic contamination in water there is an intense debate regarding the causes of arsenic contamination in bangladesh a country abundant in both surface and ground water see science 22 november 2002 and science 25 april 2003 for a debate regarding the causes of arsenic contamination in bangladesh a variety of factors such as geology hydrology and the structure of aquifers can be attributed to the causes of contamination arsenic is naturally transported in the river systems in bangladesh and adsorbed into fine grained iron or manganese oxyhydroxides these ores were deposited in floodplains and buried in the sedimentary column which later released arsenic into groundwater in certain parts of bangladesh see rahman 2002 most of the highly arsenic contaminated wells are in shallow aquifers that are 50 to 150 feet below the surface whereas deep aquifers are nearly arsenic free yu et al 2003 however it uncertain whether deep aquifers will remain arsenic free over time an alternative view is that distribution of arsenic is related to geology rather than depth since arsenic is in aquifers with newer sediments the complexity in sediment dynamics and a dearth of sediment analyses make it difficult to predict whether the high arsenic zone is hydrologically separate from deep aquifers a study on natural arsenic distribution in socorro new mexico brandvold and frisch 2002 shows that the relationship between rock type and arsenic concentration in water is not well defined in this study area in west bengal india mukherjee 2005 finds no significant relationship between depth and arsenic concentration in the sedimentary sequences to apply conventional groundwater modeling to locate arsenic free sites while answers to the questions regarding the causes of arsenic contamination in bangladesh are yet to be known with certainty it is important to acknowledge the uncertainty and surprise potential involved in policy and decision making regarding ground water extraction we apply the svk framework in decision making under environmental uncertainty associated with management of water resources the uncertainty and surprise are related to the surprise associated with the quality of various sources of water our focus is on arsenic contamination of drinking water in bangladesh to be justified for analysis based on a non expected utility framework woodward and shaw 2006 portray arsenic in drinking water as a situation where relevant probabilities are very small and the ambiguity related to outcomes due to lack of information have important health implications including mortality and morbidity thus the behavioral anomalies that people place more weight on low probability events in gain space and less weight on low probability events in loss space and also show preference towards ambiguity aversion will have significant consequences in decision making in case of arsenic contamination optimization model to apply the svk framework to this decision problem we consider a decision maker water manager who is facing uncertainty in arsenic contamination of new water sources that are being developed the water manager is considering three alternatives in his choice set that include shallow wells sw deep wells dw and surface water treatment swt let i i denote each of these sources where i sw dw swt the uncertainty involved in all these options is associated with water contamination exceeding a safety threshold long after the water supply has been developed fig 2 shows these three options for water collection with corresponding potential outcomes let b be a non empty subset of the real line b i b i 0 1 such that there is a 1 1 correspondence γ i between the decision set x i and the real line b i this can be expressed as b i γ i x i for all x i x i and b i b i let a decision maker water manager hold a belief as the potential surprise density function f i ψ b of a particular source i as 10 10 f i ψ i b i ϕ i ifb i 1 ψ i ϕ i k g i ψ i b i 2 ifb ψ i b 1 0 if 1 b i ψ i b i ϕ i k l i ψ i 1 b i 2 ifb i ψ i b i 1 ϕ i if ψ 1 b i 1 here ϕ i 0 1 represents a scaling factor to model the reduction in surprise resulting from treatment technologies the constants k g i and k l i g stands for the gain space and l for the loss space are marginal scaling coefficients representing increased or decreased surprise potential at the margin for each outcome of a decision in the gain space ψ x and loss space ψ x respectively the lower bound say b 0 i of b i represents the boundary between more favorable ψ i f ψ i b i 0 and less favorable outcomes ψ i f ψ i b i 1 this formulation also defines various endpoints of intervals through which ψ i vary let g i ψ i ξ i be the attractiveness function of the decision maker to a particular source for water augmentation represented as 11 11 g i ψ i ξ i α g i ψ i β g i ξ i if ψ x α l i ψ i β l i ξ i if ψ x here α g i and α l i are marginal attractiveness for the outcomes resulting from a decision in gain space and loss space respectively similarly β g i and β l i are marginal attractiveness repulsion for increases in surprise levels in the gain space and loss space respectively to identify optimal conditions in the gain spaces and loss spaces for each i a constrained maximization of g i ψ i ξ i subject to f i ψ i b i can be specified using the lagrangean theorem at interior points of focus loss and focus gain spaces it is easier to identify attractiveness maximizing pairs in focus gain and focus loss for b i b i the optimal tangency points are identified using dg i ψ i ξ i df i ψ i b i 0 in focus gain and focus loss spaces for each i i thus ψ g i ψ l i ξ g i and ξ l i are coordinates of the tangency between the iso attractiveness function g i ψ i ξ i and the potential surprise density function f i ψ i b i fig 3 shows these tangency points for three different options sw dw swt to develop water supply systems these coordinates are functions of b i that can be used in the development of a decision index d b i defined as 12 d b i q ψ g i ψ l i ξ g i ξ l i i i this decision index d b i is a function of b i obtained by substituting constrained maximization solution values in focus loss and focus gain spaces into q ψ g i ψ l i ξ g i ξ l i a continuously differential function katzner 1998 this index could be optimized to identify optimal b i that maximizes the combined attractiveness in the focus gain and focus loss spaces of all choice alternatives the parameters applied in our analysis are listed in table 2 these parameters are based on insights from published information on water resources in the bangladesh region our experience in water management in the region and the nature of hydrologic processes in relation to water supplies maddison et al 2005 mukherjee 2005 khan and haque 2010 khan et al 2014 the values of each parameter are discussed in detail in the following discussion the b 0 i value is the lower bound of b i that represents the boundary between more favorable and less favorable outcomes this boundary determines the threshold interval where the potential surprise increases the potential surprise for deep wells dw could be set at earlier levels of b dw as compared to sw and swt this threshold is set at b 0 dw 0 15 a higher threshold in sw is set at b 0 sw 0 3 representing a delay before one could start observing surprises this observation is consistent with the history of contamination of shallow wells observed in bangladesh the surprise associated with surface water treatment swt is much later than the other choice categories and is set at b 0 swt 0 4 representing potential surprises that occur with larger allocations resulting from plant malfunctions unknown health effects capacity obsoleteness and spikes in contamination during extreme flood events which are common in bangladesh the ϕ i parameter scales the potential surprise function for sw and dw this is set at unity indicating surprises reaching the maximum possible levels derived from the belief that these two options are driven by hydrologic process that are difficult to predict ex ante to a decision the ϕ i value for swt is relatively lower 20 compared to sw and dw in the belief that a treatment process is controllable and within the management ability before substantial changes in concentrations are seen the k g i parameter is the coefficient that increases the marginal change in the surprise in the quadratic form as 11 13 df i ψ i b i dx 2 k g i k g i b i with b ψ i b 1 the values for each i are based on the increase in surprise potential for increased levels of the activity the parameter values use relative levels in the belief that a marginal increase in surprise potential in dw is 81 of that of the marginal increase in sw this value is based on the relatively higher uncertainty and expected surprise in installing deep well compared to that of shallow well the k g swt value is higher indicating a higher increase in marginal surprises involved in treatment malfunction the k l i value reflects the marginal decrease in surprise potential in the loss spaces and can be interpreted similarly to that of k g i in the gain spaces the attractiveness function g i ψ i ξ i is specified as a linear function with marginal coefficients α g i α l i β g i β l i representing incremental attractiveness for each marginal change in the focus gain and focus loss spaces the coefficient α g i represents the marginal increase in attractiveness in a higher outcome while β g i is the marginal increase from reduction in surprise potential in the focus gain space similarly α l i and β l i are marginal changes in attractiveness from a reduction in loss of outcome and reduction of surprise in the focus loss space we assume that the water manager is indifferent to different sources of water with regard to tastes and some other likely attributes that do not impose any significant treatment cost the functions in the focus loss and focus gain spaces were simulated in mathcad software mathsoft 2006 using the parameter set described above and presented in fig 4 the optimal conditions of the constrained maximization related to the parameter set are listed in table 3 these optimal conditions are used additively in building the decision function d b i of the decision maker a second optimization was conducted to maximize d b i subject to additional restrictions on the boundaries of b i and a budgetary condition of the decision problem this can be represented as 14 max b i d b i s t i c i b i b and b 0 i b i 1 where c i is the relative cost of developing the water source and b is the total budget constraint the estimates for c i are based on ahmed 2005 and were normalized for relative costs using sw as a numeraire for optimization this decision problem was specified and solved using the gams optimization software brooke et al 1998 to identify optimal allocation of the water supply by the water manager 4 results and discussion since typical cost benefit analysis precludes addressing these types of situations we apply the potential surprise criterion to develop decision rules to manage natural resources under uncertainty in our analysis we assign a realistic pay off structure with intuitive beliefs regarding various uncertain events the prime focus is to operationalize the concept of potential surprise criterion by applying it to a practical problem that water utilities face to maintain robust supply of water based on the parameters used the optimal choice for the water manager is to build the capacity to collect 36 2 of total water allocation from sw shallow well 32 6 from dw deep well and 31 2 from swt surface water treatment our findings imply that a diversified allocation strategy which is often effective under risky situations may also be applicable to situations under uncertainty and surprise thus using the svk approach in an operational framework in the context of arsenic contamination in bangladesh we show that a diversified approach to developing water supply systems is the optimal choice under uncertainty and surprise this is consistent with risk and uncertainty literature in identifying the role of diversity in allocation to minimize overall risk in decisions there is excellent potential for using multiobjective optimization using genetic algorithms in water resource studies tanyimboh and czajkowska 2017 used penalty free genetic algorithms to model water distribution networks al jawad and tanyimboh 2017 used an evolutionary algorithm to model reservoir operations rathnayake and tanyimboh 2015 use evolutionary algorithms in control of combined sewer overflows the focus on svk operationalize uncertainty framework and could be used in characterizing uncertain outcomes in optimization studies decision making under uncertainty and surprise is an issue of critical concern in water resource management however a very limited number of studies attempt to model uncertainty and surprise explicitly in the core decision making process more specifically in case of water management system managers often face uncertainty in maintaining both the desired quantity and quality of water supplies planners and system managers often struggle with the complexity of the system dynamics which provide water for daily use the complexity of system dynamics is much more prominent in underground sources of water compared to surface sources thus uncertainty and elements of potential surprise in decision making are important for water resource management in recent years arsenic contamination has become one of the high priority environmental issues due to public health concerns management of contaminated water resources is also a challenge to developed countries such as in the u s because of prohibitive remediation costs nrc 1994 budget constraints are much more severe in developing countries and often depend on the flow of foreign aid for such projects the framework we develop is crucial to make decisions regarding water supplies under environmental uncertainty and surprise related to arsenic contamination 5 conclusion the framework we propose can be a very useful tool for utility managers who can incorporate subjective beliefs and expert opinions into the decision making process to develop a robust water supply system under potential surprise criterion the decision rule favors decisions involving low surprise and high net potential gain under unconditional uncertainty aversion thus a water manager can identify optimal allocation among water supply alternatives by considering values of surprise density and the attractiveness of each alternative in applying this framework in the bangladesh context we observe that a diversified allocation with shallow wells deep wells and surface water treatment can be the attractive policy choice in the face of uncertainty and surprise shallow wells had a slight higher optimal level 36 compare to deep wells and surface treatment which had levels of roughly 32 each the implication of the results for future policy design is that given the uncertainties and surprise involved in such cases the decisions should favor actions that minimize surprise instead of conventional cost effectiveness the diversification of the water supply system that emerges as a robust strategy to avert unintended outcomes is also along the line of evolutionary view of decision making under uncertainty which suggests actions leading to increasing diversity and adaptive flexibility rammel and van der bergh 2003 the potential surprise criterion can be extended to other applications by using relevant beliefs regarding surprise densities and attractiveness contours uncertainty and surprise is pervasive in natural resources management woodward and shaw 2006 and the potential surprise criterion can be extensively utilized in decision making in this area this approach is based on subjective beliefs and needs informed judgment and understanding of the resource system since the proposed framework is flexible to incorporate a wide range of uncertain beliefs deliberative expert elicitation of beliefs howarth and wilson 2006 can be used in collective decision making there is immense potential to extend this study to other contaminants especially nonpoint source pollution that is uncertain over geographic space and time there is a need for further research into elucidation of surprise potential and attractiveness functions further research could also focus on developing methods to evaluate tradeoffs and applicability of svk framework in decision making at multiple scales randhir 2016 applicability of this framework to uncertainty like decisions

7353,existing closed form solutions of contaminant transport problems are limited by the mathematically convenient assumption of uniform flow these solutions cannot be used to investigate contaminant transport in coastal aquifers where seawater intrusion induces a variable velocity field an adaptation of the fourier galerkin method is introduced to obtain semi analytical solutions for contaminant transport in a confined coastal aquifer in which the saltwater wedge is in equilibrium with a freshwater discharge flow two scenarios dealing with contaminant leakage from the aquifer top surface and contaminant migration from a source at the landward boundary are considered robust implementation of the fourier galerkin method is developed to efficiently solve the coupled flow salt and contaminant transport equations various illustrative examples are generated and the semi analytical solutions are compared against an in house numerical code the fourier series are used to evaluate relevant metrics characterizing contaminant transport such as the discharge flux to the sea amount of contaminant persisting in the groundwater and solute flux from the source these metrics represent quantitative data for numerical code validation and are relevant to understand the effect of seawater intrusion on contaminant transport it is observed that for the surface contamination scenario seawater intrusion limits the spread of the contaminant but intensifies the contaminant discharge to the sea for the landward contamination scenario moderate seawater intrusion affects only the spatial distribution of the contaminant plume while extreme seawater intrusion can increase the contaminant discharge to the sea the developed semi analytical solution presents an efficient tool for the verification of numerical models it provides a clear interpretation of the contaminant transport processes in coastal aquifers subject to seawater intrusion for practical usage in further studies the full open source semi analytical codes are made available at the website https lhyges unistra fr fahs marwan keywords contaminant transport coastal aquifer seawater intrusion semi analytical solution fourier series 1 introduction coastal zones are the most populated regions in the world in europe for example according to eurostat 40 8 of the population lives in coastal regions which cover 40 of the european union territory collet and engelbert 2013 in many coastal ecosystems groundwater is considered as the major source of freshwater however due to the higher population density and anthropogenic perturbations coastal aquifers are vulnerable to serious contamination risks and groundwater is increasingly under threat from pollution the protection of the groundwater reserves demands accurate predictions and assessments of the pollution impact on the aquifers therefore the study of contaminant transport in coastal aquifers ctca is essential for the management of freshwater resources and planning in coastal areas contaminant transport processes in coastal aquifers are inherently complex groundwater flow in these aquifers is significantly influenced by various processes at the seaward boundary such as variable density flow sea level rise and tidal fluctuations e g ataie ashtiani et al 1999 2013 abd elhamid and javadi 2011 bakhtyar et al 2013 anwar et al 2014 ketabchi et al 2016 lu et al 2015 coastal aquifers are primarily characterized by variations of groundwater salinity in space and time as they are often subjected to seawater intrusion werner et al 2013 due to variable density effects this salinity may affect the flow patterns and consequently the mass transport processes volker et al 2002 ctca has been investigated using laboratory experiments zhang et al 2002 chang and clement 2013 liu et al 2014 oz et al 2015 comprehensive numerical models have been developed to account for the aforementioned complexities e g ataie ashtiani 2007 miller et al 2013 despite the advances in numerical modeling the development of analytical solutions is still necessary to verify the computer models and to perform scoping calculations e g bolster et al 2007 chen et al 2012 hayek et al 2012 shahkarami et al 2015 parker and kim 2015 analytical solutions are ideally suited for the interpretation of the physical processes they are suitable for conducting sensitivity and uncertainty analysis as well as for parameter estimation because they can be computed more efficiently than numerical solutions however due to the complexity of the mathematical model analytical solutions of contaminant transport can be only obtained under simplified conditions for ctca and in general for 2d contaminant transport in variable velocity fields there is a scarcity of analytical solutions bolster et al 2007 some analytical solutions have been developed for non uniform velocity by transforming the variable coefficients of the advection dispersion equation to constant coefficients tartakovsky and federico 1997 tartakovsky 2000 craig and heidlauf 2009 these solutions have been obtained for cases dealing with theoretical variable velocity fields bolster et al 2007 developed analytical solutions for contaminant transport in coastal aquifers on the basis of a perturbation expansion in the parameter that describes the coupling between the flow and salt transport processes the perturbation method may result in poor accuracy when the perturbation parameter is not sufficiently small yeh et al 2010 semi analytical methods take advantage of both analytical methods and numerical techniques and circumvent many limitations of the analytical methods allowing them to be applied in more complex problems suk 2016 ameli and craig 2014 recently a semi analytical solution for solute transport in a coastal aquifer subject to tidal fluctuations was developed by suk 2017 based on the classical integral transformation technique in this solution the saltwater wedge and density differences were not considered the fourier galerkin fg method has been widely used to derive high accuracy solutions for problems involving fluid flow mass and or heat transfer this method combines the exactness of the analytical methods with an important extent of generality in describing the geometry and boundary conditions as with the numerical methods bnilam and al khoury

kuznetsov 2012 double diffusive convection shao et al 2016 and heat flow in geothermal systems bnilam and al khoury 2017 in the context of coastal aquifers the fg method has been used to obtain the semi analytical solutions of the popular henry seawater intrusion problem henry 1964 ségol 1994 simpson and clement 2004 zidane et al 2012 recently fahs et al 2016 and younes and fahs 2014 have developed efficient implementations of the fg method to solve the henry problem with increasing levels of complexity and realism in view of the scarcity of analytical solutions for ctca the objective of this work was i to derive semi analytical solutions for problems dealing with contaminant transport in coastal aquifers using the fg method and ii to take advantage of these solutions to investigate the effect of seawater intrusion on contaminant transport the semi analytical solution is developed for two contamination scenarios dealing with contaminant leakage from the aquifer top surface and contaminant migration from a source at the landward boundary an adaptation of the fg method is introduced to solve coupled flow salt transport and contaminant transport equations efficient implementation is presented to deal with discontinuous contaminant boundary conditions to the best of our knowledge such boundary conditions type has never been solved with the fg method the fourier series are used to evaluate several metrics assessing the contaminant transport such as the discharge flux to the sea the amount of contaminant persisting in the groundwater the area of the contaminated zone and the solute flux as measured by the sherwood number these metrics are used to investigate the effect of seawater intrusion in contaminant plume migration necessary assumptions i e vertical coastal boundary constant salt concentration at the sea boundary and constant dispersion tensor were made to obtain the semi analytical solutions such assumptions are common practice in coastal aquifers modeling despite these simplifications the results of this study highlighted the worthiness of the developed semi analytical solutions for benchmarking numerical models and provided a clear and new understanding of the processes of plume migration in coastal aquifers 2 problem description and governing equations the configuration under consideration is inspired from the henry problem which has a long history in the investigation of seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers henry 1964 the problem considers a rectangular aquifer of length ℓ and depth d the domain is subjected to a constant flux of freshwater on its left vertical edge the right vertical edge is assumed to be in contact with the sea the top and bottom horizontal surfaces are impermeable fig 1 this is an idealization of coastal aquifers that made the assumption of vertical coastal boundary and neglects the effect of freshwater discharge on the seawater salinity these assumptions are necessary to obtain the semi analytical solution yang et al 2013 have shown how the idealized vertical beach can be used to model real coastal aquifers despite these idealized assumptions henry problem continues to be used as a surrogate for the understanding of seawater intrusion mechanisms abarca et al 2007 lu et al 2009 kerrou and renard 2010 yang et al 2013 nick et al 2013 rajabi and ataie ashtiani 2014 riva et al 2015 sebben et al 2015 fahs et al 2016 two contamination scenarios were studied in this work the first scenario is defined by considering a contaminant source at the aquifer top surface fig 1a this scenario corresponds to practical applications where the contaminant reaches the aquifer surface by diffusive leakage through the upper confining unit typical examples of this scenario could be the contaminants leaking through the confining unit from waste disposal and landfill sites septic tanks fuel storage tanks and pesticide spills woumeni and vauclin 2006 kopp et al 2010 bakhtyar et al 2013 geng et al 2017 an analytical solution pertaining to a similar scenario in an inland confined aquifer under uniform velocity field has been developed by emami meybodi et al 2015 in the second scenario the contaminant source is located upstream of the freshwater flow fig 1b this source may represent leaching from relatively deep waste disposal facility chen et al 2016a this scenario is widely used for testing numerical algorithms of transport in inland aquifers younes and ackerer 2008 burdakov et al 2012 finkel et al 2016 and for understanding transport processes chen et al 2016b c analytical solutions for this scenario in an inland aquifer have been presented by leij and dane 1990 and chen et al 2016b the combined cases of these contamination scenarios together with seawater intrusion do not exist in current literature they are clearly interesting important and significant physical problems that warrant attention for both scenarios the contaminant is considered as a tracer such a configuration was investigated experimentally by chang and clement 2013 and analytically by bolster et al 2007 this assumption is made in this work to decouple saltwater intrusion and contaminant transport systems which alleviates computationally the fourier series solution procedure water flow in the domain can be modeled using the continuity equation and darcy s law under steady state conditions the governing equations can be written as follows guevara morel et al 2015 1 q 0 2 q ρ 0 g μ k h ρ ρ 0 ρ 0 z where q is the darcy s velocity lt 1 h is the equivalent freshwater head l g is the gravitational acceleration lt 2 ρ is the density of the fluid ml 3 μ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid ml 1 t 1 k is the permeability l 2 ρ 0 is the freshwater density ml 3 and z is depth l steady state conditions are assumed for both saltwater and passive contaminant mass transport such a condition is common for the investigation of seawater intrusion as salt transport in coastal aquifers is a long term natural process the leakage of contaminants is usually accidental and transient steady state conditions can be reached if the contaminant source is permanent practical examples corresponding to this configuration could be the permanent landfills located near shorelines cox et al 1996 njue et al 2012 in this work contaminant transport steady state conditions are assumed because at this stage of research fg method cannot be applied to transient systems furthermore steady state solutions are relevant to understand the asymptotic behavior of transient problems the salt and contaminant transport equations can be written as 3 q s d s s 0 4 q c d c c 0 where c resp s is the relative solute concentration of contaminant resp saltwater which corresponds to the solute concentration normalized by the concentration of the source contamination resp seawater d c resp d s is the diffusion dispersion coefficient for contaminant resp salt l 2 t 1 the saltwater transport equation is coupled with the flow system via the linear mixture density equation as follows 5 ρ ρ 0 ρ 1 ρ 0 s where ρ 1 is the seawater density ml 3 a constant isotropic dispersion tensor is considered for the sake of ultimate accuracy this assumption is necessary to obtain the semi analytical solution without recourse to numerical integration required for the treatment of the velocity dependent dispersion terms it is also necessary to render the solution affordable without excessive computational requirement fahs et al 2016 the assumption of constant dispersion tensor was firstly suggested by henry 1964 and widely considered in subsequent studies related to the henry problem kalejaiye and cardoso 2005 have shown that in the case where gravity is the main driving force natural convection this assumption is legitimate for flows where the rayleigh number is 1000 bolster et al 2007 have generalized this assumption to contaminant transport in coastal aquifers in such a case the rayleigh number quantifies the relative importance of the buoyancy and dispersive forces within the saltwater wedge as defined by kalejaiye and cardoso 2005 and bolster et al 2007 the rayleigh number is given by 6 ra ρ 1 ρ 0 k d g μ d s the boundary conditions for flow and salt transport are similar to the standard henry problem the contaminant transport is subject to the boundary conditions as in eqs 7 and 8 for the top surface and landward contamination scenarios respectively 7 c x 0 x 0 x ℓ c 0 z 0 c f top x z d 8 c z 0 z 0 z d c f land z x 0 c 0 x ℓ where f top x and f land z are functions simulating the distribution of the contaminant source they will be introduced and discussed further in the text 3 the semi analytical solution 3 1 adaptation of the fg method the semi analytical solutions of both contamination scenarios are derived using the fg method applied to the stream function form of the governing equations specific changes of variables are used for each contamination scenario in order to obtain periodic boundary conditions that are essential for the fg method using the stream function the non dimensional form of the flow and saltwater transport equations are given

bolster et al 2007 q d l 2 t 1 is the recharge of freshwater from the landward boundary into the domain ξ ℓ d is the aspect ratio x x d and z z d ψ ψ q d z and s s x ξ are the new non dimensional

nl and nk are the number of fourier series modes truncation orders in the x and z direction respectively e k l represents the fourier series coefficients the fg method can give high accuracy solutions with relatively few fourier modes as it converges exponentially to the exact solution however in the case of sharp solutions the number of fourier modes should be considerably increased in order to prevent the occurrence of nonphysical oscillations related to the gibbs phenomenon ameli et al 2013 for the surface contamination scenario there is a discontinuity in the boundary condition as the source of contamination is imposed at a given interval of the top surface in order to control the sharpness of the transition the source is approximated by a smoother function based on a hyperbolic tangent as previously employed in van reeuwijk et al 2009 the source function used in the semi analytical solution is 18 f top x 1 tan h x x c l c 2 where x c is the dimensionless abscissa of the contaminant source and l c is the dimensionless source diameter both normalized by the aquifer depth d the justification behind defining this source function is that depending on x c and l c the values of the first derivative can be zero on left and right boundaries f top 0 f top ξ 0 thus the boundary conditions on the top and bottom surfaces remain periodic similar to the flow and saltwater system the fourier expansions of the stream function ψ and contaminant concentration s are substituted into eq 15 the arising equations are then multiplied by the trial function θ 4 sin g π z cos h π

listed in the appendix i 3 2 implementation for the surface contamination scenario the semi analytical solution is obtained by solving the system of eqs 13 14 and 19 this system is solved sequentially thus eqs 13 and 14 are firstly solved as a nonlinear system to obtain the coefficients a m n and b r s this step is performed using the fortran computer code developed by fahs et al 2016 next the coefficients a m n are substituted in eq 19 this yields a linear system with the coefficients e g h as unknowns the same procedure is applied to the landward contamination scenario by replacing eq 19 by eq 24 two computer codes are developed in fortran language to obtain the fourier series solution for both considered scenarios in these codes we implemented the unifrontal multifrontal parallel linear solver umfpack davis 2004 which has shown several advantages in the numerical simulation of water resources problems miller et al 2013 preliminary runs of these codes have shown that despite the advantages of the linear solver the solution is cpu consuming and impractical scrutiny of this matter reveals that the most time consuming task of the solving procedure is the numerical evaluation of the integrals i 1 bc i 2 bc and i 3 bc for the first scenario and j 1 bc j 2 bc j 3 bc and j 4 bc for the second scenario these integrals are independent of the parameters describing the flow and transport processes hence we evaluated them separately and used them directly in the codes for the evaluation of the numerical integrals we used a specific integration routine from the imsl libraries qdawo http www roguewave com products services imsl numerical libraries fortran libraries this procedure allows for considerable reduction in the number of operations required for the numerical integration for instance if we consider a hypothetical case where nm nn nk nl 100 and we use 1000 points for the numerical integration the evaluation of the term involving i 2 bc in the final system requires o 10 12 operations by applying the procedure described here the number of operations can be reduced to be o 10 9 in addition the computational efficiency of the semi analytical method is enhanced by an openmp parallel implementation for the evaluation of the matrix and the right hand side of the system 4 evaluation of the contaminant transport characteristics in our analysis we addressed several practical concerns related to the migration of contaminants in a coastal aquifer these include for example the mass rate of contaminant released in the domain the location and the area of the contaminated zone and the contaminant discharge to the sea thus we used the fourier series to evaluate analytically i the concentration contours ii the contaminant plume area a c iii the amount of contaminant remaining in the aquifer m c iv the average sherwood number sh and v the mass flux of contaminant discharge to the sea f c a c is defined by the area of the domain where the contaminant concentration is greater than 0 1 it is calculated by numerical integration the mass of the contaminant that persists in the aquifer at the steady state regime is defined by m c 0 1 0 ξ c dxdz it can be expressed in terms of the fourier coefficients as follows 25 m c ξ π k 1 nk 1 1 k k e k 0 1 2 0 ξ f top x dx first scenario surface ξ π l 1 nl 1 1 l l e 0 l ξ 2 0 1 f land z dz second scenario landward the sherwood number is analogous to the nusselt number in heat transfer it represents the ratio of the mass rate transferred due to forced convection to the one transferred by dispersion at the boundary xie et al 2012 26 sh h m d c d where h m is the forced convection mass transfer coefficient for the first scenario the mass transfer between the impermeable layer and the groundwater in the aquifer occurs by forced convection within the solute boundary layer along the aquifer top surface in this case the total mass flow rate can be calculated using the mass analogous newton s cooling law conservation between the forced convection and dispersive fluxes at the top surface can be written as follows 27 d c d c z z 1 h m c surf c 0 where c surf and c 0 are the contaminant concentration at the surface and within the entering freshwater in our case we have c surf f top x and c 0 0 hence using eq 27 the local sherwood number can be expressed in terms of the concentration gradient at the aquifer top surface by 28 sh h m d c d 1 f top x c z z 1 sh can be calculated using the fourier series expansion of the concentration as follows 29 sh π f top x k 1 nk l

processes the mass conservation at the landward boundary does not allow sh to be expressed in terms of concentration thus the sherwood number cannot be evaluated for the surface contamination scenario the contaminant discharge flux to the sea can be calculated as follows 31 f c z i 1 q x c x ξ dz 1 π k 1 nk l 0 nl 1 l cos k π z i 1 k k e k l 1 2 m 1 nm n 0 nn k 1 nk l 0 nl m 1 n l a m n e k l cos π

discharge zone and the seawater inland flow zone z i is evaluated analytically using the fourier series in the landward contamination scenario the contaminant discharge to the sea is given by 32 f c 1 pe c 0 1 c x x ξ dz π pe c ξ l 1 nl l 1 l e 0 l 1 pe c ξ 0 1 f land z dz the integrals in eqs 30 and 32 are evaluated numerically using the imsl library 5 results and discussions three test examples dealing with different dispersion coefficients are examined and discussed for each scenario we based the discussion on test cases with different dispersion coefficients because the sharpness of the solution and as a consequence its stability is chiefly controlled by this parameter in addition these cases can be relevant to assess the effect of the péclet number on the contaminant transport processes the physical parameters used for the three test cases are d 1 m ℓ 2 5 m ρ 0 1000 kg m 3 ρ 1 1025 kg m 3 q d 6 6 10 5 m 2 s 1 k 1 0204 10 9 m 2 μ 10 3 kg m 1 s 1 ε 0 35 and g 9 81 m s 2 these parameters are identical to those used in the original henry problem except the domain length as in zidane et al 2012 ℓ is increased to be 2 5 m instead of 2 m in the standard henry problem to reduce the inland boundary effects on the semi analytical solution we assumed equal values for d c and d s as in bolster et al 2007 three values extracted from the literature are considered 6 601 10 6 m 2 s 1 1 3202 10 6 m 2 s 1 and 3 3005 10 7 m 2 s 1 henry 1964 zidane et al 2012 younes and fahs 2014 the corresponding péclet numbers are 10 50 and 200 respectively for the surface contamination scenario we assumed x c 1 5 and l c 0 4 with these values the source can be as close as possible to the sea while satisfying the conditions imposed on the function f top x f top 0 4 10 11 and f top ξ 10 4 for the landward contamination scenario we assumed z c 0 5 and l c 0 2 as it is customary in the literature the conditions on the function f land z are satisfied because f land 0 f land 1 0 0003 for all cases the coupled flow and saltwater transport equations are solved as in fahs et al 2016 with 19 120 fourier coefficients nm 40 nn 90 nr 42 and ns 360 5 1 stability of the semi analytical solution and effect of the péclet number as mention previously the fourier series solution may suffer from unphysical oscillations when the solution is relatively sharp these oscillations are related to the gibbs phenomenon durran 1999 ameli et al 2013 fahs et al 2014 in such a case a large number of fourier modes should be used to obtain stable concentration contours the evaluation of the sherwood number sh for the first scenario and the discharge flux f c for the second scenario involves the first order derivatives of the concentration fourier series accurate values of sh and f c requires more fourier modes than that required to obtain stable concentration contours in this work we assumed that the solution is stable when sh and f c becomes insensitive to the fourier modes 5 1 1 results for the surface contamination scenario for the first test case pe pe c pe s 10 we obtained stable concentration contours with 210 fourier coefficients nk 10 nl 20 the stable value of the sherwood number requires 1550 fourier coefficients nk 50 nl 30 in the second and third test cases pe 50 and 200 the concentration distributions are sharper than the first case the stable solutions have been obtained respectively using 4550 nk 50 nl 90 and 7770 nk 70 nl 110 fourier coefficients the semi analytical results contaminant plume velocity field and saltwater isochlors are given in fig 2 this figure displays different behaviors for the plume migration saltwater wedge and contaminant discharge to the sea depending on the péclet number for the first test case small péclet number fig 2a shows that the isochlors are relatively close to the contaminant source due to the high dispersivity the contaminant transport occurs within the mixing zone the contaminant mainly reaches the sea through the saltwater wedge fig 2b and c show that the increase of the péclet number leads to a greater penetration of the seawater tongue at the aquifer bottom and a significant recession of the saltwater wedge at the top surface the increase in pe is equivalent to the increase of the rayleigh number ra n g pe this can be interpreted as an intensification of the buoyancy effects against dispersion mechanisms within the saltwater wedge and results in a more accelerated downward vertical flow near the sea boundary fluid mass conservation and boundary conditions convert the acceleration of the vertical velocity into horizontal flow near the bottom surface and cause greater penetration of the seawater tongue at the top surface advection dominates over dispersion the freshwater discharge washes out the saltwater and prohibits the saltwater penetration in this zone contrary to the first test case for intermediate and high péclet number regimes the contaminant transport does not occur in the saltwater wedge indeed when the plume approaches the saltwater interface it is uplifted by the flow and exits to the sea through the freshwater discharge zone fig 2 also shows that the contaminated zone contracts and becomes nearly horizontal above the saltwater wedge when pe is increased this is related to the freshwater flow intensification in front of the contaminant source which can be explained as follows the increase in péclet number pushes the saltwater wedge landward this saltwater wedge forms a barrier narrowing the area through which the freshwater is discharged to the sea this causes the acceleration of the freshwater flow above the saltwater wedge as a consequence the solute boundary shrinks and the contaminated zone contracts table 1 summarizes the ultimate values of the metrics characterizing the contaminant transport a c m c f c and sh for the three test cases as expected this table shows a reduction of a c with the increase in pe which is consistent with the results shown in fig 2 table 1 also indicates that the amount of contaminant remaining in the aquifer m c decreases as pe increases m c depends on the contaminant release to the aquifer and the duration required to reach steady state conditions the former is attenuated with an increase in pe as explained at the end of this paragraph the duration required to reach stationary conditions depends mainly on the advection processes it diminishes with an increase in pe table 1 shows that sh increases with pe in fact sh is proportional to the concentration gradient with the increase of pe the solute boundary layer shrinks and the concentration gradient increases in general sh provides a measure of the mass transfer occurring at the surface its augmentation is often seen as an increase of the average forced convection mass transfer coefficient h m d c sh d and indicates the amplification of the mass transfer from the contaminated surface to the aquifer however this assumption is not valid in our case because the dispersion coefficient is variable to further elaborate the effect of pe on the amount of contaminant entering the domain we calculated the rate of mass transfer between the contaminated surface and the aquifer the values for the three test cases are calculated to be 0 09 0 04 and 0 02 respectively they indicate that despite the concentration gradient increase with pe the mass rate of contaminant entering the domain decreases finally table 1 shows that f c decreases as pe increases this is related to the attenuation of the contaminant release because at steady state the flux of contaminant discharge to the sea is equal to the mass flux entering the domain 5 1 2 results for the landward contamination scenario for the three test cases stable solutions have been obtained with 2790 nk 30 nl 90 6150 nk 40 nl 150 and 15 300 nk 50 nl 300 fourier coefficients respectively the semi analytical results are plotted in fig 3 the first observation is that the second scenario leads to more widespread contamination in the aquifer than the first one for the three péclet number regimes the contaminant plume travels within the domain toward the freshwater discharge zone at the upper part of the seaside boundary fig 3a shows that the contaminant transport in the saltwater wedge is compelling but it is limited to the zone of low isochlors for pe 10 unlike the surface contamination scenario the contaminant does not reach the sea through the saltwater wedge it is transported by the upward velocity and discharged mainly at the top of the seaside boundary for the intermediate value of pe the contaminant concentration contours closely follow the flow structure fig 3b the contaminant transport still occurs in the saltwater wedge in contrast to the first scenario but its occurrence is relatively attenuated for the highest value of pe test case 3 the contaminant transport does not occur in the saltwater wedge fig 3c the ultimate values of a c m c and f c are listed in table 1 the conclusions drawn for the first scenario concerning the variation of a c m c are still applicable f c appears to be insensitive to pe the behavior of a c is evident and only the variations of m c and f c will be discussed here the behavior of f c can be explained as follows in the steady state regime the rate of contaminant discharge to the sea is equal to the rate of mass entering through the landward boundary which is mainly due to advection as the concentration gradient is negligible hence at constant gravity number f c is slightly sensitive to pe we recall that the value of f c is equal to the dimensionless mass rate of contaminant entering the domain 0 1 f land z dz 0 303 which confirms a good mass balance obtained with the semi analytical method despite the fact that the input and output fluxes are insensitive to pe m c slightly decreases the reason for this variation is related to the time duration required to reach the steady state condition which as for the first scenario decreases as pe increases 5 2 comparison against numerical solution verification efficiency of the fg implementation and benchmarking issues two computer codes have been developed to obtain the semi analytical solutions for both considered scenarios experiments that deals with the conceptual model considered in this paper do not exist in the literature hence to examine the correctness of these codes we compared their results with those obtained using an advanced in house numerical model younes and ackerer 2008 younes et al 2009 this model is based on specific techniques for both space and time discretization its efficiency and accuracy have been highlighted in several applications related to density driven flow and transport in porous media konz et al 2009 fahs et al 2014 2015 2016 shao et al 2016 to compare transient numerical solutions against steady state semi analytical solutions we performed transient simulations for a long duration for ultimate accuracy numerical simulations are performed using a fine mesh of 36 000 regular triangles the results of the numerical model have been compared against the semi analytical solutions for seawater intrusion in younes and fahs 2014 and fahs et al 2016 for the sake of brevity we present here the comparison only for the contaminant transport fig 4 illustrates the numerical and semi analytical concentration contours 10 30 50 70 and 90 for both scenarios close agreement between the semi analytical and numerical solutions can be seen table 2 lists the metrics characterizing the contaminant transport obtained using the numerical model these results also confirm the excellent agreement between the numerical and semi analytical solutions this comparison provides compelling evidence on the correctness of the new codes developed for the semi analytical solutions and more confidence on the robustness of the numerical model we should mention that the comparison is not only based on visual inspection which can be somewhat subjective it is also based on quantitative indicators that provide more rigorous evaluation further numerical simulations are performed to highlight the relevance of the semi analytical solution in avoiding time and space discretization artifacts these artifacts may seriously affect the accuracy of the predictive results the parameter estimation procedure and the sensitivity analysis outcomes nassar and ginn 2014 esfandiar et al 2015 the results not presented for the sake of brevity show that in the case of high péclet number the numerical solution is sensitive to the level of mesh refinement coarser meshes introduce important numerical dispersion that can lead to significant anomalies when comparing numerical and semi analytical solutions numerical simulations also show that careful attention must be paid to the time step size in order to avoid possible unphysical oscillations in some cases the oscillations are related to seawater intrusion because they appear at the interface between the freshwater and saltwater wedge numerical simulations are also relevant to highlight the efficiency of the semi analytical solution from a computational point of view we compared the number of fourier modes required to obtain the stable semi analytical solution to the number of unknowns of the numerical model required to obtain equivalent accuracy the results show that the semi analytical method requires many less unknowns than the numerical model irrespective of pe and for both contamination scenarios the superiority of the semi analytical method becomes more pronounced as pe is increased for instance in the high péclet number case surface contamination scenario the semi analytical solution requires about 7000 fourier coefficients equivalent accuracy can be obtained with a numerical solution involving a mesh of about 20 000 elements corresponding to about 90 000 degrees of freedom to further highlight the computational efficiency of the semi analytical method we evaluated the amount of improvement obtained by applying the specific technique implemented in the codes for the evaluation of the numerical integrals see section 3 we considered as an example a case of the first scenario in which about 4500 fourier coefficients should be used to obtain the semi analytical solution we performed the calculations on a single computer with two intel xeon e5 2690 series 2 12 cores sharing 64 gb of memory the results show that with the standard procedure the cpu time is measured to be more than 1 h for the same case the cpu time with the new technique for the evaluation of numerical integrals reduces to only 12 min this represents a gain of performance of about 450 with the parallel implementation the evaluation of this solution takes only 78 s this result highlights on the one hand the high efficiency of our implementation and on the other hand the flexibility of the semi analytical method to enable parallel programming the developed semi analytical solutions can be used for validating and testing numerical codes in the case of coupled flow and transport processes or only transport under known flow field conditions in this context the results presented in this paper mainly fig 4 can be directly used in further comparative studies tables 1 and 2 also provide highly accurate quantitative data that can be used for benchmarking purposes furthermore to facilitate the validation and benchmarking tasks for other configurations we provide the full semi analytical codes on the website https lhyges unistra fr fahs marwan 5 3 effect of seawater intrusion on contaminant transport in this section we take advantage of the proposed semi analytical solution to investigate the effect of n g on the contaminant transport processes we aim to provide a better understanding of the influence of seawater intrusion on the contaminant plume migration and discharge to the sea sixteen runs were carried out for each test case of the contamination scenarios by varying the value of n g similarly to abarca et al 2007 n g was varied between 0 625 and 20 in this discussion for the sake of clarity the variation of n g at constant pe will be interpreted as a variation of the aquifer permeability thus the increase of n g will be seen as an increase of the aquifer permeability this leads to an intensification of the flow within the saltwater wedge and results in a greater intrusion of the saltwater tongue the intensification of seawater intrusion in turn accelerates the freshwater main flow as it narrows the pathway through which the freshwater is discharged to the sea in the following we will discuss the influence of this velocity variation on the contaminant plume characteristics 5 3 1 results for the surface contamination scenario fig 5 reports the contaminant concentration contours 20 50 and 80 for three selected values of n g it shows that for the three péclet regimes the contaminant plume moves up toward the aquifer top surface as n g is increased this is related to the shrinking of the solute boundary layer caused by the acceleration of the freshwater flow in front of the contaminant source the effects of n g on a c m c f c and sh are reported in fig 6 a decreasing variation of a c is reported which is consistent with fig 5 m c also decreases fig 6b due to the reduction in the time required to reach the steady state regime the results reveal a strong correlation between a c and m c which fit very well with the bi exponential regression model given by y 0 a 1 e n g t 1 a 2 e n g t 2 the coefficients y 0 a 1 t 1 a 2 and t 2 are given in appendix ii this model explains that a c and m c are exponentially decaying when n g is increased but with different rates depending on n g indeed as we can see in appendix ii t 1 is significantly less than t 2 this means that for small values of n g we have n g t 2 0 hence the exponential term involving t 1 dominates the one with t 2 the reverse is true for the largest values of n g fig 6c and d show that sh and f c are perfectly correlated in fact sh measures the mass rate of contaminant release at the inlet which is equal at steady state conditions to the rate of contaminant discharge to the sea this good correlation highlights the accuracy of the simulations and gives more confidence in the robustness of the analysis only the variation of sh will be discussed here fig 6c indicates the existence of two regimes for the evolution of sh we have almost constant value for small gravity number and increasing variation otherwise for small gravity number the seawater wedge is very far from the contamination source hence there is no influence of the seawater intrusion on the contaminant concentration distribution for large values of n g the intense seawater intrusion intensifies the freshwater flow in front of the source and increases the concentration gradient this result indicates that seawater intrusion can increase the contaminant leakage to the aquifer and as a consequence the risk of contaminant discharge to the sea the regression analysis reveals a good fitting of sh with a second degree polynomial model for the regime where n g is influential the polynomial model is given by b 0 b 1 n g b 1 n g 2 the coefficients are given in appendix ii 5 3 2 results for the landward contamination scenario fig 7 displays the contaminant concentration contours 20 50 and 80 for three selected values of n g it shows that the plume migration is more sensitive to the seawater intrusion than the first scenario the plume moves up toward the top surface of the aquifer with an increase in n g for the smallest values of n g seawater intrusion affects mainly the low concentration contours near the sea while for the largest values all concentration contours are impacted throughout the entire aquifer fig 8 displays the variations of a c m c and f c as a function of n g fig 8a shows a decreasing variation of a c at constant péclet number this indicates that seawater intrusion limits the spread of the contaminant the same behavior is recorded for m c fig 8b which is also related to the flow acceleration that reduces the duration required to reach the steady state condition fig 8b also shows that at small gravity number n g 1 m c is almost insensitive to pe this is logical because for n g 1 the seawater intrusion is very weak hence the increase of pe has a slight impact on the flow velocity and by consequence has limited impact on the duration required to reach the steady state condition the variation of f c exhibits two regimes depending on n g fig 8c a better understanding of this behavior can be gained by investigating the effect of n g on the mass rate of contaminant entering the aquifer which is equal to f c under time stationary conditions at small gravity numbers the contaminant mainly enters the domain by advection due to the freshwater recharge flux hence f c is independent of n g for the extreme cases of seawater intrusion largest values of n g the saltwater wedge can reach the landward boundary and generates an uplifting flow along the landward vertical boundary the vertical component of the velocity can generate a concentration gradient and amplify the contaminant penetration in the aquifer because the diffusive flux becomes a significant component of the contaminant flux below the critical n g corresponding to the transition between the two regimes of evolution a further increase in n g leads to intense seawater intrusion and causes the increase of contaminant mass entering the domain and consequently the increase of f c good regression for all metrics can be obtained using the second degree polynomial model b 0 b 1 n g b 1 n g 2 the coefficients are given in appendix ii the good regression gives additional confidence in the physical plausibility of the results 6 conclusion a semi analytical solution is derived for the simulation of contaminant transport in a coastal aquifer subject to seawater intrusion the problem geometry and configuration are inspired from the henry problem two contamination scenarios dealing with contaminant leakage from a source at the aquifer top surface and aquifer contamination from the landward boundary are considered the semi analytical solutions are developed based on the fg method an adaptation of this method is developed to deal with discontinuous contaminant boundary conditions specific changes of variables have been applied in order to include the contamination source according to the prescribed contamination scenarios the fourier series have been used to evaluate several metrics characterizing the contaminant transport a sound implementation of the fg based on openmp parallel programming and an appropriate evaluation of the fourier series has been developed to optimize the computational requirements of the semi analytical method using this implementation the semi analytical solutions have been obtained for example cases dealing with high péclet numbers the main inconvenience of the fg solution is related to its rather complex implementation for practical usage in further studies the full open source semi analytical code is made available at the website https lhyges unistra fr fahs marwan the developed semi analytical solution is compared against the numerical solution of an in house code an excellent agreement has been observed which gives confidence on the correctness of both semi analytical and numerical solutions this comparison shows that the semi analytical solutions avoid several numerical artifacts related to space discretization and time integration this highlights their benefits as useful mathematical tools for validating numerical models of ctca and in general for contaminant transport under variable velocity field in this context the analytical values of the metrics characterizing the contaminant transport a c m c f c and sh provide high quality high accuracy quantitative indicators suitable for code benchmarking the high robustness and computational efficiency of the developed semi analytical method render it suitable for forward analysis i e parameter estimation or global sensitivity analysis where a large number of solutions must be evaluated furthermore results show that the semi analytical solutions developed in this work help to improve our understanding of the contaminant transport mechanisms in coastal aquifers subjected to seawater intrusion the findings and conclusions drawn are relevant for the management of groundwater pollution in coastal aquifers as the developed test cases can be found in several real applications related to coastal aquifer contamination results indicate that in the case of surface contamination seawater intrusion leads to a contracted contaminant plume but increases the contaminant discharge to the sea in the case of landward contamination moderate seawater intrusion only affects the spatial distribution of the contaminant plume and has no effect on the contaminant discharge to the sea however extreme seawater intrusion can increase the contaminant discharge to the sea analytical expressions of the contaminant transport metrics in terms of the gravity number characterizing seawater intrusion are derived the introduced semi analytical method is not limited to the scenarios discussed in this work it can be applied to other interesting scenarios of contaminant transport in coastal aquifers and a wide range of applications involving coupled flow and transport processes we note that the presented semi analytical solution can be extended to dense pollutant transport and heterogeneous coastal aquifers questions about how fg method can be effectively and efficiently used to solve velocity dependent dispersion transport and or transient problems is worthy of future inquiry acknowledgement

7353,existing closed form solutions of contaminant transport problems are limited by the mathematically convenient assumption of uniform flow these solutions cannot be used to investigate contaminant transport in coastal aquifers where seawater intrusion induces a variable velocity field an adaptation of the fourier galerkin method is introduced to obtain semi analytical solutions for contaminant transport in a confined coastal aquifer in which the saltwater wedge is in equilibrium with a freshwater discharge flow two scenarios dealing with contaminant leakage from the aquifer top surface and contaminant migration from a source at the landward boundary are considered robust implementation of the fourier galerkin method is developed to efficiently solve the coupled flow salt and contaminant transport equations various illustrative examples are generated and the semi analytical solutions are compared against an in house numerical code the fourier series are used to evaluate relevant metrics characterizing contaminant transport such as the discharge flux to the sea amount of contaminant persisting in the groundwater and solute flux from the source these metrics represent quantitative data for numerical code validation and are relevant to understand the effect of seawater intrusion on contaminant transport it is observed that for the surface contamination scenario seawater intrusion limits the spread of the contaminant but intensifies the contaminant discharge to the sea for the landward contamination scenario moderate seawater intrusion affects only the spatial distribution of the contaminant plume while extreme seawater intrusion can increase the contaminant discharge to the sea the developed semi analytical solution presents an efficient tool for the verification of numerical models it provides a clear interpretation of the contaminant transport processes in coastal aquifers subject to seawater intrusion for practical usage in further studies the full open source semi analytical codes are made available at the website https lhyges unistra fr fahs marwan keywords contaminant transport coastal aquifer seawater intrusion semi analytical solution fourier series 1 introduction coastal zones are the most populated regions in the world in europe for example according to eurostat 40 8 of the population lives in coastal regions which cover 40 of the european union territory collet and engelbert 2013 in many coastal ecosystems groundwater is considered as the major source of freshwater however due to the higher population density and anthropogenic perturbations coastal aquifers are vulnerable to serious contamination risks and groundwater is increasingly under threat from pollution the protection of the groundwater reserves demands accurate predictions and assessments of the pollution impact on the aquifers therefore the study of contaminant transport in coastal aquifers ctca is essential for the management of freshwater resources and planning in coastal areas contaminant transport processes in coastal aquifers are inherently complex groundwater flow in these aquifers is significantly influenced by various processes at the seaward boundary such as variable density flow sea level rise and tidal fluctuations e g ataie ashtiani et al 1999 2013 abd elhamid and javadi 2011 bakhtyar et al 2013 anwar et al 2014 ketabchi et al 2016 lu et al 2015 coastal aquifers are primarily characterized by variations of groundwater salinity in space and time as they are often subjected to seawater intrusion werner et al 2013 due to variable density effects this salinity may affect the flow patterns and consequently the mass transport processes volker et al 2002 ctca has been investigated using laboratory experiments zhang et al 2002 chang and clement 2013 liu et al 2014 oz et al 2015 comprehensive numerical models have been developed to account for the aforementioned complexities e g ataie ashtiani 2007 miller et al 2013 despite the advances in numerical modeling the development of analytical solutions is still necessary to verify the computer models and to perform scoping calculations e g bolster et al 2007 chen et al 2012 hayek et al 2012 shahkarami et al 2015 parker and kim 2015 analytical solutions are ideally suited for the interpretation of the physical processes they are suitable for conducting sensitivity and uncertainty analysis as well as for parameter estimation because they can be computed more efficiently than numerical solutions however due to the complexity of the mathematical model analytical solutions of contaminant transport can be only obtained under simplified conditions for ctca and in general for 2d contaminant transport in variable velocity fields there is a scarcity of analytical solutions bolster et al 2007 some analytical solutions have been developed for non uniform velocity by transforming the variable coefficients of the advection dispersion equation to constant coefficients tartakovsky and federico 1997 tartakovsky 2000 craig and heidlauf 2009 these solutions have been obtained for cases dealing with theoretical variable velocity fields bolster et al 2007 developed analytical solutions for contaminant transport in coastal aquifers on the basis of a perturbation expansion in the parameter that describes the coupling between the flow and salt transport processes the perturbation method may result in poor accuracy when the perturbation parameter is not sufficiently small yeh et al 2010 semi analytical methods take advantage of both analytical methods and numerical techniques and circumvent many limitations of the analytical methods allowing them to be applied in more complex problems suk 2016 ameli and craig 2014 recently a semi analytical solution for solute transport in a coastal aquifer subject to tidal fluctuations was developed by suk 2017 based on the classical integral transformation technique in this solution the saltwater wedge and density differences were not considered the fourier galerkin fg method has been widely used to derive high accuracy solutions for problems involving fluid flow mass and or heat transfer this method combines the exactness of the analytical methods with an important extent of generality in describing the geometry and boundary conditions as with the numerical methods bnilam and al khoury 2017 in the frame of flow and transfer in porous media fg method has been used for density driven flow fahs et al 2014 van reeuwijk et al 2009 thermal natural convection fahs et al 2015 nield and kuznetsov 2012 double diffusive convection shao et al 2016 and heat flow in geothermal systems bnilam and al khoury 2017 in the context of coastal aquifers the fg method has been used to obtain the semi analytical solutions of the popular henry seawater intrusion problem henry 1964 ségol 1994 simpson and clement 2004 zidane et al 2012 recently fahs et al 2016 and younes and fahs 2014 have developed efficient implementations of the fg method to solve the henry problem with increasing levels of complexity and realism in view of the scarcity of analytical solutions for ctca the objective of this work was i to derive semi analytical solutions for problems dealing with contaminant transport in coastal aquifers using the fg method and ii to take advantage of these solutions to investigate the effect of seawater intrusion on contaminant transport the semi analytical solution is developed for two contamination scenarios dealing with contaminant leakage from the aquifer top surface and contaminant migration from a source at the landward boundary an adaptation of the fg method is introduced to solve coupled flow salt transport and contaminant transport equations efficient implementation is presented to deal with discontinuous contaminant boundary conditions to the best of our knowledge such boundary conditions type has never been solved with the fg method the fourier series are used to evaluate several metrics assessing the contaminant transport such as the discharge flux to the sea the amount of contaminant persisting in the groundwater the area of the contaminated zone and the solute flux as measured by the sherwood number these metrics are used to investigate the effect of seawater intrusion in contaminant plume migration necessary assumptions i e vertical coastal boundary constant salt concentration at the sea boundary and constant dispersion tensor were made to obtain the semi analytical solutions such assumptions are common practice in coastal aquifers modeling despite these simplifications the results of this study highlighted the worthiness of the developed semi analytical solutions for benchmarking numerical models and provided a clear and new understanding of the processes of plume migration in coastal aquifers 2 problem description and governing equations the configuration under consideration is inspired from the henry problem which has a long history in the investigation of seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers henry 1964 the problem considers a rectangular aquifer of length ℓ and depth d the domain is subjected to a constant flux of freshwater on its left vertical edge the right vertical edge is assumed to be in contact with the sea the top and bottom horizontal surfaces are impermeable fig 1 this is an idealization of coastal aquifers that made the assumption of vertical coastal boundary and neglects the effect of freshwater discharge on the seawater salinity these assumptions are necessary to obtain the semi analytical solution yang et al 2013 have shown how the idealized vertical beach can be used to model real coastal aquifers despite these idealized assumptions henry problem continues to be used as a surrogate for the understanding of seawater intrusion mechanisms abarca et al 2007 lu et al 2009 kerrou and renard 2010 yang et al 2013 nick et al 2013 rajabi and ataie ashtiani 2014 riva et al 2015 sebben et al 2015 fahs et al 2016 two contamination scenarios were studied in this work the first scenario is defined by considering a contaminant source at the aquifer top surface fig 1a this scenario corresponds to practical applications where the contaminant reaches the aquifer surface by diffusive leakage through the upper confining unit typical examples of this scenario could be the contaminants leaking through the confining unit from waste disposal and landfill sites septic tanks fuel storage tanks and pesticide spills woumeni and vauclin 2006 kopp et al 2010 bakhtyar et al 2013 geng et al 2017 an analytical solution pertaining to a similar scenario in an inland confined aquifer under uniform velocity field has been developed by emami meybodi et al 2015 in the second scenario the contaminant source is located upstream of the freshwater flow fig 1b this source may represent leaching from relatively deep waste disposal facility chen et al 2016a this scenario is widely used for testing numerical algorithms of transport in inland aquifers younes and ackerer 2008 burdakov et al 2012 finkel et al 2016 and for understanding transport processes chen et al 2016b c analytical solutions for this scenario in an inland aquifer have been presented by leij and dane 1990 and chen et al 2016b the combined cases of these contamination scenarios together with seawater intrusion do not exist in current literature they are clearly interesting important and significant physical problems that warrant attention for both scenarios the contaminant is considered as a tracer such a configuration was investigated experimentally by chang and clement 2013 and analytically by bolster et al 2007 this assumption is made in this work to decouple saltwater intrusion and contaminant transport systems which alleviates computationally the fourier series solution procedure water flow in the domain can be modeled using the continuity equation and darcy s law under steady state conditions the governing equations can be written as follows guevara morel et al 2015 1 q 0 2 q ρ 0 g μ k h ρ ρ 0 ρ 0 z where q is the darcy s velocity lt 1 h is the equivalent freshwater head l g is the gravitational acceleration lt 2 ρ is the density of the fluid ml 3 μ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid ml 1 t 1 k is the permeability l 2 ρ 0 is the freshwater density ml 3 and z is depth l steady state conditions are assumed for both saltwater and passive contaminant mass transport such a condition is common for the investigation of seawater intrusion as salt transport in coastal aquifers is a long term natural process the leakage of contaminants is usually accidental and transient steady state conditions can be reached if the contaminant source is permanent practical examples corresponding to this configuration could be the permanent landfills located near shorelines cox et al 1996 njue et al 2012 in this work contaminant transport steady state conditions are assumed because at this stage of research fg method cannot be applied to transient systems furthermore steady state solutions are relevant to understand the asymptotic behavior of transient problems the salt and contaminant transport equations can be written as 3 q s d s s 0 4 q c d c c 0 where c resp s is the relative solute concentration of contaminant resp saltwater which corresponds to the solute concentration normalized by the concentration of the source contamination resp seawater d c resp d s is the diffusion dispersion coefficient for contaminant resp salt l 2 t 1 the saltwater transport equation is coupled with the flow system via the linear mixture density equation as follows 5 ρ ρ 0 ρ 1 ρ 0 s where ρ 1 is the seawater density ml 3 a constant isotropic dispersion tensor is considered for the sake of ultimate accuracy this assumption is necessary to obtain the semi analytical solution without recourse to numerical integration required for the treatment of the velocity dependent dispersion terms it is also necessary to render the solution affordable without excessive computational requirement fahs et al 2016 the assumption of constant dispersion tensor was firstly suggested by henry 1964 and widely considered in subsequent studies related to the henry problem kalejaiye and cardoso 2005 have shown that in the case where gravity is the main driving force natural convection this assumption is legitimate for flows where the rayleigh number is 1000 bolster et al 2007 have generalized this assumption to contaminant transport in coastal aquifers in such a case the rayleigh number quantifies the relative importance of the buoyancy and dispersive forces within the saltwater wedge as defined by kalejaiye and cardoso 2005 and bolster et al 2007 the rayleigh number is given by 6 ra ρ 1 ρ 0 k d g μ d s the boundary conditions for flow and salt transport are similar to the standard henry problem the contaminant transport is subject to the boundary conditions as in eqs 7 and 8 for the top surface and landward contamination scenarios respectively 7 c x 0 x 0 x ℓ c 0 z 0 c f top x z d 8 c z 0 z 0 z d c f land z x 0 c 0 x ℓ where f top x and f land z are functions simulating the distribution of the contaminant source they will be introduced and discussed further in the text 3 the semi analytical solution 3 1 adaptation of the fg method the semi analytical solutions of both contamination scenarios are derived using the fg method applied to the stream function form of the governing equations specific changes of variables are used for each contamination scenario in order to obtain periodic boundary conditions that are essential for the fg method using the stream function the non dimensional form of the flow and saltwater transport equations are given

saltwater concentration in the x and z direction pairwise and respectively a m n and b r s are the fourier series coefficients the fourier series expansions are substituted into eqs 9 and 10 and the resulting equations are multiplied by the trial functions fourier modes and integrated overall the domain this yields a final system of nonlinear equations with the fourier coefficients as unknowns 13

nl and nk are the number of fourier series modes truncation orders in the x and z direction respectively e k l represents the fourier series coefficients the fg method can give high accuracy solutions with relatively few fourier modes as it converges exponentially to the exact solution however in the case of sharp solutions the number of fourier modes should be considerably increased in order to prevent the occurrence of nonphysical oscillations related to the gibbs phenomenon ameli et al 2013 for the surface contamination scenario there is a discontinuity in the boundary condition as the source of contamination is imposed at a given interval of the top surface in order to control the sharpness of the transition the source is approximated by a smoother function based on a hyperbolic tangent as previously employed in van reeuwijk et al 2009 the source function used in the semi analytical solution is 18 f top x 1 tan h x x c l c 2 where x c is the dimensionless abscissa of the contaminant source and l c is the dimensionless source diameter both normalized by the aquifer depth d the justification behind defining this source function is that depending on x c and l c the values of the first derivative can be zero on left and right boundaries f top 0 f top ξ 0 thus the boundary conditions on the top and bottom surfaces remain periodic similar to the flow and saltwater system the fourier expansions of the stream function ψ and contaminant concentration s are substituted into eq 15 the arising equations are then multiplied by the trial function θ 4 sin g π z cos h π

listed in the appendix i 3 2 implementation for the surface contamination scenario the semi analytical solution is obtained by solving the system of eqs 13 14 and 19 this system is solved sequentially thus eqs 13 and 14 are firstly solved as a nonlinear system to obtain the coefficients a m n and b r s this step is performed using the fortran computer code developed by fahs et al 2016 next the coefficients a m n are substituted in eq 19 this yields a linear system with the coefficients e g h as unknowns the same procedure is applied to the landward contamination scenario by replacing eq 19 by eq 24 two computer codes are developed in fortran language to obtain the fourier series solution for both considered scenarios in these codes we implemented the unifrontal multifrontal parallel linear solver umfpack davis 2004 which has shown several advantages in the numerical simulation of water resources problems miller et al 2013 preliminary runs of these codes have shown that despite the advantages of the linear solver the solution is cpu consuming and impractical scrutiny of this matter reveals that the most time consuming task of the solving procedure is the numerical evaluation of the integrals i 1 bc i 2 bc and i 3 bc for the first scenario and j 1 bc j 2 bc j 3 bc and j 4 bc for the second scenario these integrals are independent of the parameters describing the flow and transport processes hence we evaluated them separately and used them directly in the codes for the evaluation of the numerical integrals we used a specific integration routine from the imsl libraries qdawo http www roguewave com products services imsl numerical libraries fortran libraries this procedure allows for considerable reduction in the number of operations required for the numerical integration for instance if we consider a hypothetical case where nm nn nk nl 100 and we use 1000 points for the numerical integration the evaluation of the term involving i 2 bc in the final system requires o 10 12 operations by applying the procedure described here the number of operations can be reduced to be o 10 9 in addition the computational efficiency of the semi analytical method is enhanced by an openmp parallel implementation for the evaluation of the matrix and the right hand side of the system 4 evaluation of the contaminant transport characteristics in our analysis we addressed several practical concerns related to the migration of contaminants in a coastal aquifer these include for example the mass rate of contaminant released in the domain the location and the area of the contaminated zone and the contaminant discharge to the sea thus we used the fourier series to evaluate analytically i the concentration contours ii the contaminant plume area a c iii the amount of contaminant remaining in the aquifer m c iv the average sherwood number sh and v the mass flux of contaminant discharge to the sea f c a c is defined by the area of the domain where the contaminant concentration is greater than 0 1 it is calculated by numerical integration the mass of the contaminant that persists in the aquifer at the steady state regime is defined by m c 0 1 0 ξ c dxdz it can be expressed in terms of the fourier coefficients as follows 25 m c ξ π k 1 nk 1 1 k k e k 0 1 2 0 ξ f top x dx first scenario surface ξ π l 1 nl 1 1 l l e 0 l ξ 2 0 1 f land z dz second scenario landward the sherwood number is analogous to the nusselt number in heat transfer it represents the ratio of the mass rate transferred due to forced convection to the one transferred by dispersion at the boundary xie et al 2012 26 sh h m d c d where h m is the forced convection mass transfer coefficient for the first scenario the mass transfer between the impermeable layer and the groundwater in the aquifer occurs by forced convection within the solute boundary layer along the aquifer top surface in this case the total mass flow rate can be calculated using the mass analogous newton s cooling law conservation between the forced convection and dispersive fluxes at the top surface can be written as follows 27 d c d c z z 1 h m c surf c 0 where c surf and c 0 are the contaminant concentration at the surface and within the entering freshwater in our case we have c surf f top x and c 0 0 hence using eq 27 the local sherwood number can be expressed in terms of the concentration gradient at the aquifer top surface by 28 sh h m d c d 1 f top x c z z 1 sh can be calculated using the fourier series expansion of the concentration as follows 29 sh π f top x k 1 nk l

processes the mass conservation at the landward boundary does not allow sh to be expressed in terms of concentration thus the sherwood number cannot be evaluated for the surface contamination scenario the contaminant discharge flux to the sea can be calculated as follows 31 f c z i 1 q x c x ξ dz 1 π k 1 nk l 0 nl 1 l cos k π z i 1 k k e k l 1 2 m 1 nm n 0 nn k 1 nk l 0 nl m 1 n l a m n e k l cos π

discharge zone and the seawater inland flow zone z i is evaluated analytically using the fourier series in the landward contamination scenario the contaminant discharge to the sea is given by 32 f c 1 pe c 0 1 c x x ξ dz π pe c ξ l 1 nl l 1 l e 0 l 1 pe c ξ 0 1 f land z dz the integrals in eqs 30 and 32 are evaluated numerically using the imsl library 5 results and discussions three test examples dealing with different dispersion coefficients are examined and discussed for each scenario we based the discussion on test cases with different dispersion coefficients because the sharpness of the solution and as a consequence its stability is chiefly controlled by this parameter in addition these cases can be relevant to assess the effect of the péclet number on the contaminant transport processes the physical parameters used for the three test cases are d 1 m ℓ 2 5 m ρ 0 1000 kg m 3 ρ 1 1025 kg m 3 q d 6 6 10 5 m 2 s 1 k 1 0204 10 9 m 2 μ 10 3 kg m 1 s 1 ε 0 35 and g 9 81 m s 2 these parameters are identical to those used in the original henry problem except the domain length as in zidane et al 2012 ℓ is increased to be 2 5 m instead of 2 m in the standard henry problem to reduce the inland boundary effects on the semi analytical solution we assumed equal values for d c and d s as in bolster et al 2007 three values extracted from the literature are considered 6 601 10 6 m 2 s 1 1 3202 10 6 m 2 s 1 and 3 3005 10 7 m 2 s 1 henry 1964 zidane et al 2012 younes and fahs 2014 the corresponding péclet numbers are 10 50 and 200 respectively for the surface contamination scenario we assumed x c 1 5 and l c 0 4 with these values the source can be as close as possible to the sea while satisfying the conditions imposed on the function f top x f top 0 4 10 11 and f top ξ 10 4 for the landward contamination scenario we assumed z c 0 5 and l c 0 2 as it is customary in the literature the conditions on the function f land z are satisfied because f land 0 f land 1 0 0003 for all cases the coupled flow and saltwater transport equations are solved as in fahs et al 2016 with 19 120 fourier coefficients nm 40 nn 90 nr 42 and ns 360 5 1 stability of the semi analytical solution and effect of the péclet number as mention previously the fourier series solution may suffer from unphysical oscillations when the solution is relatively sharp these oscillations are related to the gibbs phenomenon durran 1999 ameli et al 2013 fahs et al 2014 in such a case a large number of fourier modes should be used to obtain stable concentration contours the evaluation of the sherwood number sh for the first scenario and the discharge flux f c for the second scenario involves the first order derivatives of the concentration fourier series accurate values of sh and f c requires more fourier modes than that required to obtain stable concentration contours in this work we assumed that the solution is stable when sh and f c becomes insensitive to the fourier modes 5 1 1 results for the surface contamination scenario for the first test case pe pe c pe s 10 we obtained stable concentration contours with 210 fourier coefficients nk 10 nl 20 the stable value of the sherwood number requires 1550 fourier coefficients nk 50 nl 30 in the second and third test cases pe 50 and 200 the concentration distributions are sharper than the first case the stable solutions have been obtained respectively using 4550 nk 50 nl 90 and 7770 nk 70 nl 110 fourier coefficients the semi analytical results contaminant plume velocity field and saltwater isochlors are given in fig 2 this figure displays different behaviors for the plume migration saltwater wedge and contaminant discharge to the sea depending on the péclet number for the first test case small péclet number fig 2a shows that the isochlors are relatively close to the contaminant source due to the high dispersivity the contaminant transport occurs within the mixing zone the contaminant mainly reaches the sea through the saltwater wedge fig 2b and c show that the increase of the péclet number leads to a greater penetration of the seawater tongue at the aquifer bottom and a significant recession of the saltwater wedge at the top surface the increase in pe is equivalent to the increase of the rayleigh number ra n g pe this can be interpreted as an intensification of the buoyancy effects against dispersion mechanisms within the saltwater wedge and results in a more accelerated downward vertical flow near the sea boundary fluid mass conservation and boundary conditions convert the acceleration of the vertical velocity into horizontal flow near the bottom surface and cause greater penetration of the seawater tongue at the top surface advection dominates over dispersion the freshwater discharge washes out the saltwater and prohibits the saltwater penetration in this zone contrary to the first test case for intermediate and high péclet number regimes the contaminant transport does not occur in the saltwater wedge indeed when the plume approaches the saltwater interface it is uplifted by the flow and exits to the sea through the freshwater discharge zone fig 2 also shows that the contaminated zone contracts and becomes nearly horizontal above the saltwater wedge when pe is increased this is related to the freshwater flow intensification in front of the contaminant source which can be explained as follows the increase in péclet number pushes the saltwater wedge landward this saltwater wedge forms a barrier narrowing the area through which the freshwater is discharged to the sea this causes the acceleration of the freshwater flow above the saltwater wedge as a consequence the solute boundary shrinks and the contaminated zone contracts table 1 summarizes the ultimate values of the metrics characterizing the contaminant transport a c m c f c and sh for the three test cases as expected this table shows a reduction of a c with the increase in pe which is consistent with the results shown in fig 2 table 1 also indicates that the amount of contaminant remaining in the aquifer m c decreases as pe increases m c depends on the contaminant release to the aquifer and the duration required to reach steady state conditions the former is attenuated with an increase in pe as explained at the end of this paragraph the duration required to reach stationary conditions depends mainly on the advection processes it diminishes with an increase in pe table 1 shows that sh increases with pe in fact sh is proportional to the concentration gradient with the increase of pe the solute boundary layer shrinks and the concentration gradient increases in general sh provides a measure of the mass transfer occurring at the surface its augmentation is often seen as an increase of the average forced convection mass transfer coefficient h m d c sh d and indicates the amplification of the mass transfer from the contaminated surface to the aquifer however this assumption is not valid in our case because the dispersion coefficient is variable to further elaborate the effect of pe on the amount of contaminant entering the domain we calculated the rate of mass transfer between the contaminated surface and the aquifer the values for the three test cases are calculated to be 0 09 0 04 and 0 02 respectively they indicate that despite the concentration gradient increase with pe the mass rate of contaminant entering the domain decreases finally table 1 shows that f c decreases as pe increases this is related to the attenuation of the contaminant release because at steady state the flux of contaminant discharge to the sea is equal to the mass flux entering the domain 5 1 2 results for the landward contamination scenario for the three test cases stable solutions have been obtained with 2790 nk 30 nl 90 6150 nk 40 nl 150 and 15 300 nk 50 nl 300 fourier coefficients respectively the semi analytical results are plotted in fig 3 the first observation is that the second scenario leads to more widespread contamination in the aquifer than the first one for the three péclet number regimes the contaminant plume travels within the domain toward the freshwater discharge zone at the upper part of the seaside boundary fig 3a shows that the contaminant transport in the saltwater wedge is compelling but it is limited to the zone of low isochlors for pe 10 unlike the surface contamination scenario the contaminant does not reach the sea through the saltwater wedge it is transported by the upward velocity and discharged mainly at the top of the seaside boundary for the intermediate value of pe the contaminant concentration contours closely follow the flow structure fig 3b the contaminant transport still occurs in the saltwater wedge in contrast to the first scenario but its occurrence is relatively attenuated for the highest value of pe test case 3 the contaminant transport does not occur in the saltwater wedge fig 3c the ultimate values of a c m c and f c are listed in table 1 the conclusions drawn for the first scenario concerning the variation of a c m c are still applicable f c appears to be insensitive to pe the behavior of a c is evident and only the variations of m c and f c will be discussed here the behavior of f c can be explained as follows in the steady state regime the rate of contaminant discharge to the sea is equal to the rate of mass entering through the landward boundary which is mainly due to advection as the concentration gradient is negligible hence at constant gravity number f c is slightly sensitive to pe we recall that the value of f c is equal to the dimensionless mass rate of contaminant entering the domain 0 1 f land z dz 0 303 which confirms a good mass balance obtained with the semi analytical method despite the fact that the input and output fluxes are insensitive to pe m c slightly decreases the reason for this variation is related to the time duration required to reach the steady state condition which as for the first scenario decreases as pe increases 5 2 comparison against numerical solution verification efficiency of the fg implementation and benchmarking issues two computer codes have been developed to obtain the semi analytical solutions for both considered scenarios experiments that deals with the conceptual model considered in this paper do not exist in the literature hence to examine the correctness of these codes we compared their results with those obtained using an advanced in house numerical model younes and ackerer 2008 younes et al 2009 this model is based on specific techniques for both space and time discretization its efficiency and accuracy have been highlighted in several applications related to density driven flow and transport in porous media konz et al 2009 fahs et al 2014 2015 2016 shao et al 2016 to compare transient numerical solutions against steady state semi analytical solutions we performed transient simulations for a long duration for ultimate accuracy numerical simulations are performed using a fine mesh of 36 000 regular triangles the results of the numerical model have been compared against the semi analytical solutions for seawater intrusion in younes and fahs 2014 and fahs et al 2016 for the sake of brevity we present here the comparison only for the contaminant transport fig 4 illustrates the numerical and semi analytical concentration contours 10 30 50 70 and 90 for both scenarios close agreement between the semi analytical and numerical solutions can be seen table 2 lists the metrics characterizing the contaminant transport obtained using the numerical model these results also confirm the excellent agreement between the numerical and semi analytical solutions this comparison provides compelling evidence on the correctness of the new codes developed for the semi analytical solutions and more confidence on the robustness of the numerical model we should mention that the comparison is not only based on visual inspection which can be somewhat subjective it is also based on quantitative indicators that provide more rigorous evaluation further numerical simulations are performed to highlight the relevance of the semi analytical solution in avoiding time and space discretization artifacts these artifacts may seriously affect the accuracy of the predictive results the parameter estimation procedure and the sensitivity analysis outcomes nassar and ginn 2014 esfandiar et al 2015 the results not presented for the sake of brevity show that in the case of high péclet number the numerical solution is sensitive to the level of mesh refinement coarser meshes introduce important numerical dispersion that can lead to significant anomalies when comparing numerical and semi analytical solutions numerical simulations also show that careful attention must be paid to the time step size in order to avoid possible unphysical oscillations in some cases the oscillations are related to seawater intrusion because they appear at the interface between the freshwater and saltwater wedge numerical simulations are also relevant to highlight the efficiency of the semi analytical solution from a computational point of view we compared the number of fourier modes required to obtain the stable semi analytical solution to the number of unknowns of the numerical model required to obtain equivalent accuracy the results show that the semi analytical method requires many less unknowns than the numerical model irrespective of pe and for both contamination scenarios the superiority of the semi analytical method becomes more pronounced as pe is increased for instance in the high péclet number case surface contamination scenario the semi analytical solution requires about 7000 fourier coefficients equivalent accuracy can be obtained with a numerical solution involving a mesh of about 20 000 elements corresponding to about 90 000 degrees of freedom to further highlight the computational efficiency of the semi analytical method we evaluated the amount of improvement obtained by applying the specific technique implemented in the codes for the evaluation of the numerical integrals see section 3 we considered as an example a case of the first scenario in which about 4500 fourier coefficients should be used to obtain the semi analytical solution we performed the calculations on a single computer with two intel xeon e5 2690 series 2 12 cores sharing 64 gb of memory the results show that with the standard procedure the cpu time is measured to be more than 1 h for the same case the cpu time with the new technique for the evaluation of numerical integrals reduces to only 12 min this represents a gain of performance of about 450 with the parallel implementation the evaluation of this solution takes only 78 s this result highlights on the one hand the high efficiency of our implementation and on the other hand the flexibility of the semi analytical method to enable parallel programming the developed semi analytical solutions can be used for validating and testing numerical codes in the case of coupled flow and transport processes or only transport under known flow field conditions in this context the results presented in this paper mainly fig 4 can be directly used in further comparative studies tables 1 and 2 also provide highly accurate quantitative data that can be used for benchmarking purposes furthermore to facilitate the validation and benchmarking tasks for other configurations we provide the full semi analytical codes on the website https lhyges unistra fr fahs marwan 5 3 effect of seawater intrusion on contaminant transport in this section we take advantage of the proposed semi analytical solution to investigate the effect of n g on the contaminant transport processes we aim to provide a better understanding of the influence of seawater intrusion on the contaminant plume migration and discharge to the sea sixteen runs were carried out for each test case of the contamination scenarios by varying the value of n g similarly to abarca et al 2007 n g was varied between 0 625 and 20 in this discussion for the sake of clarity the variation of n g at constant pe will be interpreted as a variation of the aquifer permeability thus the increase of n g will be seen as an increase of the aquifer permeability this leads to an intensification of the flow within the saltwater wedge and results in a greater intrusion of the saltwater tongue the intensification of seawater intrusion in turn accelerates the freshwater main flow as it narrows the pathway through which the freshwater is discharged to the sea in the following we will discuss the influence of this velocity variation on the contaminant plume characteristics 5 3 1 results for the surface contamination scenario fig 5 reports the contaminant concentration contours 20 50 and 80 for three selected values of n g it shows that for the three péclet regimes the contaminant plume moves up toward the aquifer top surface as n g is increased this is related to the shrinking of the solute boundary layer caused by the acceleration of the freshwater flow in front of the contaminant source the effects of n g on a c m c f c and sh are reported in fig 6 a decreasing variation of a c is reported which is consistent with fig 5 m c also decreases fig 6b due to the reduction in the time required to reach the steady state regime the results reveal a strong correlation between a c and m c which fit very well with the bi exponential regression model given by y 0 a 1 e n g t 1 a 2 e n g t 2 the coefficients y 0 a 1 t 1 a 2 and t 2 are given in appendix ii this model explains that a c and m c are exponentially decaying when n g is increased but with different rates depending on n g indeed as we can see in appendix ii t 1 is significantly less than t 2 this means that for small values of n g we have n g t 2 0 hence the exponential term involving t 1 dominates the one with t 2 the reverse is true for the largest values of n g fig 6c and d show that sh and f c are perfectly correlated in fact sh measures the mass rate of contaminant release at the inlet which is equal at steady state conditions to the rate of contaminant discharge to the sea this good correlation highlights the accuracy of the simulations and gives more confidence in the robustness of the analysis only the variation of sh will be discussed here fig 6c indicates the existence of two regimes for the evolution of sh we have almost constant value for small gravity number and increasing variation otherwise for small gravity number the seawater wedge is very far from the contamination source hence there is no influence of the seawater intrusion on the contaminant concentration distribution for large values of n g the intense seawater intrusion intensifies the freshwater flow in front of the source and increases the concentration gradient this result indicates that seawater intrusion can increase the contaminant leakage to the aquifer and as a consequence the risk of contaminant discharge to the sea the regression analysis reveals a good fitting of sh with a second degree polynomial model for the regime where n g is influential the polynomial model is given by b 0 b 1 n g b 1 n g 2 the coefficients are given in appendix ii 5 3 2 results for the landward contamination scenario fig 7 displays the contaminant concentration contours 20 50 and 80 for three selected values of n g it shows that the plume migration is more sensitive to the seawater intrusion than the first scenario the plume moves up toward the top surface of the aquifer with an increase in n g for the smallest values of n g seawater intrusion affects mainly the low concentration contours near the sea while for the largest values all concentration contours are impacted throughout the entire aquifer fig 8 displays the variations of a c m c and f c as a function of n g fig 8a shows a decreasing variation of a c at constant péclet number this indicates that seawater intrusion limits the spread of the contaminant the same behavior is recorded for m c fig 8b which is also related to the flow acceleration that reduces the duration required to reach the steady state condition fig 8b also shows that at small gravity number n g 1 m c is almost insensitive to pe this is logical because for n g 1 the seawater intrusion is very weak hence the increase of pe has a slight impact on the flow velocity and by consequence has limited impact on the duration required to reach the steady state condition the variation of f c exhibits two regimes depending on n g fig 8c a better understanding of this behavior can be gained by investigating the effect of n g on the mass rate of contaminant entering the aquifer which is equal to f c under time stationary conditions at small gravity numbers the contaminant mainly enters the domain by advection due to the freshwater recharge flux hence f c is independent of n g for the extreme cases of seawater intrusion largest values of n g the saltwater wedge can reach the landward boundary and generates an uplifting flow along the landward vertical boundary the vertical component of the velocity can generate a concentration gradient and amplify the contaminant penetration in the aquifer because the diffusive flux becomes a significant component of the contaminant flux below the critical n g corresponding to the transition between the two regimes of evolution a further increase in n g leads to intense seawater intrusion and causes the increase of contaminant mass entering the domain and consequently the increase of f c good regression for all metrics can be obtained using the second degree polynomial model b 0 b 1 n g b 1 n g 2 the coefficients are given in appendix ii the good regression gives additional confidence in the physical plausibility of the results 6 conclusion a semi analytical solution is derived for the simulation of contaminant transport in a coastal aquifer subject to seawater intrusion the problem geometry and configuration are inspired from the henry problem two contamination scenarios dealing with contaminant leakage from a source at the aquifer top surface and aquifer contamination from the landward boundary are considered the semi analytical solutions are developed based on the fg method an adaptation of this method is developed to deal with discontinuous contaminant boundary conditions specific changes of variables have been applied in order to include the contamination source according to the prescribed contamination scenarios the fourier series have been used to evaluate several metrics characterizing the contaminant transport a sound implementation of the fg based on openmp parallel programming and an appropriate evaluation of the fourier series has been developed to optimize the computational requirements of the semi analytical method using this implementation the semi analytical solutions have been obtained for example cases dealing with high péclet numbers the main inconvenience of the fg solution is related to its rather complex implementation for practical usage in further studies the full open source semi analytical code is made available at the website https lhyges unistra fr fahs marwan the developed semi analytical solution is compared against the numerical solution of an in house code an excellent agreement has been observed which gives confidence on the correctness of both semi analytical and numerical solutions this comparison shows that the semi analytical solutions avoid several numerical artifacts related to space discretization and time integration this highlights their benefits as useful mathematical tools for validating numerical models of ctca and in general for contaminant transport under variable velocity field in this context the analytical values of the metrics characterizing the contaminant transport a c m c f c and sh provide high quality high accuracy quantitative indicators suitable for code benchmarking the high robustness and computational efficiency of the developed semi analytical method render it suitable for forward analysis i e parameter estimation or global sensitivity analysis where a large number of solutions must be evaluated furthermore results show that the semi analytical solutions developed in this work help to improve our understanding of the contaminant transport mechanisms in coastal aquifers subjected to seawater intrusion the findings and conclusions drawn are relevant for the management of groundwater pollution in coastal aquifers as the developed test cases can be found in several real applications related to coastal aquifer contamination results indicate that in the case of surface contamination seawater intrusion leads to a contracted contaminant plume but increases the contaminant discharge to the sea in the case of landward contamination moderate seawater intrusion only affects the spatial distribution of the contaminant plume and has no effect on the contaminant discharge to the sea however extreme seawater intrusion can increase the contaminant discharge to the sea analytical expressions of the contaminant transport metrics in terms of the gravity number characterizing seawater intrusion are derived the introduced semi analytical method is not limited to the scenarios discussed in this work it can be applied to other interesting scenarios of contaminant transport in coastal aquifers and a wide range of applications involving coupled flow and transport processes we note that the presented semi analytical solution can be extended to dense pollutant transport and heterogeneous coastal aquifers questions about how fg method can be effectively and efficiently used to solve velocity dependent dispersion transport and or transient problems is worthy of future inquiry acknowledgement

7354,abrupt changes are an important manifestation of hydrological variability how to accurately detect the abrupt changes in hydrological time series and evaluate their significance is an important issue but methods for dealing with them effectively are lacking in this study we propose an approach to evaluate the significance of abrupt changes in time series at five levels no weak moderate strong and dramatic the approach was based on an index of correlation coefficient calculated for the original time series and its abrupt change component a bigger value of correlation coefficient reflects a higher significance level of abrupt change results of monte carlo experiments verified the reliability of the proposed approach and also indicated the great influence of statistical characteristics of time series on the significance level of abrupt change the approach was derived from the relationship between correlation coefficient index and abrupt change and can estimate and grade the significance levels of abrupt changes in hydrological time series application of the proposed approach to ten major watersheds in china showed that abrupt changes mainly occurred in five watersheds in northern china which have arid or semi arid climate and severe shortages of water resources runoff processes in northern china were more sensitive to precipitation change than those in southern china although annual precipitation and surface water resources amount swra exhibited a harmonious relationship in most watersheds abrupt changes in the latter were more significant compared with abrupt changes in annual precipitation human activities contributed much more to the abrupt changes in the corresponding swra except for the northwest inland river watershed keywords hydrological variability abrupt change detection and attribution significance evaluation rainfall runoff relationship water resources utility 1 introduction climate change with global warming coupled with intensive human activities is alleged to be altering land surface conditions and causing significant variability in streamflow regimes in many basins and regions worldwide bates et al 2008 berghuijs et al 2015 teutschbein et al 2015 the construction and operation of water conservancy projects dams channel modifications drainage works etc especially have changed the seasonal distribution of and have caused abrupt changes in streamflow at basin scales vörösmarty et al 2000 poff et al 2015 griffin 2016 how to attribute the physical causes of hydrological variability and how to accurately detect the human caused signals from the natural hydrological variability are therefore important questions mccabe and wolock 2002 rosenzweig and neofotis 2013 mccuen 2016 understanding the hydrological variability is needed first to answer these questions as well as for hydrological simulation and forecasting water resources management control of water disasters and many other water activities varis et al 2004 however accurate detection and attribution of complex variability in hydrological processes at multi time scales is still a challenging task ganguli and ganguly 2016 supratid et al 2017 and the difficulty has not been resolved although many methods that are used presently zhang et al 2014 lloyd et al 2014 an abrupt change is one of the important external manifestation of the variability of hydroclimate process wong et al 2006 rougé et al 2013 nayak and villarini 2016 and it mainly reflects the occurrence of an extreme event or a severe anthropogenic activity wagener et al 2010 detection of abrupt change point acp is also the first issue to be tackled for hydrological time series analysis lest their existence would influence the identification of trend and periodicities sang 2013 sang et al 2015 there have been a large number of methods for detecting acps in time series brodsky and darkhovsky 2013 perreault et al 2000 such as moving t test welch 1947 moving f test jackson et al 2017 mann kendall test kisi and ay 2014 and pettitt test pettitt 1979 based on their different mathematical hypotheses and scopes of application these methods can be divided as parametric and non parametric stuart et al 2010 generally all methods for the detection of acps have advantages and weaknesses lloyd et al 2014 jeon et al 2016 turner et al 2016 and they cannot sufficiently meet practical needs one pesky problem in the detection of acps is how to quantitatively assess their statistical significance although the methods used presently set a certain statistical threshold to judge if a change point is significant or not such as 0 5 in pettitt test pettitt 1979 the characteristic indices in these tests usually have large value ranges from negative to positive infinity sometimes when using these thresholds the classification of significance levels becomes crude and the degree of abrupt changes cannot be directly estimated which is unfavorable for the assessment of impact and risk of potential consequences caused by the abrupt changes moreover the detection of acps not only depends on the absolute difference between before and after the change point but also is impacted by statistical characteristics of the original series such as sample size and degree of dispersion villarini et al 2009 therefore accurately identifying and assessing the significance levels of acps in hydroclimate time series is still an open question a specific gradation of the significance levels of acps is therefore needed and the factors that influence the gradation should be determined too in order to accurately assess and grade the significance levels of acps in hydroclimate time series an effective index should be defined the index should clearly show the degree of difference between before and after the change point and should indicate the influence of other factors on the detection such as change point position and dispersion of the series considering that acps are just one part of the original time series we can quantify the correlation between the abrupt change component and original series a bigger correlation coefficient in general would represent a bigger proportion of abrupt change component in the original series the correlation coefficient has a value range of 1 1 and its value at a given confidence level can be mathematically determined troch et al 2013 mccuen 2016 therefore the correlation coefficient could be considered as an effective index for grading the significance levels of abrupt changes in hydroclimate time series the objective of this study therefore is to employ the correlation coefficient as an index to develop an approach to grading the significance levels of acps in hydroclimate time series with an example of abrupt changes in precipitation and surface water resources amounts over china to do that section 2 formulates the relationship between correlation coefficient and degree of difference before and after the change point and then develops an approach to the gradation of significance levels of acps in time series in section 3 synthetic series data generated by monte carlo simulation are used as examples to verify the proposed approach and investigate the influence of several main factors the approach is applied to investigate the abrupt changes in precipitation and surface water resources amounts in ten major watersheds over china in section 4 followed by conclusions finally 2 method proposed for grading significance levels of abrupt changes 2 1 derivation of relationship between correlation coefficient and abrupt change in order to confirm the effectiveness of the correlation coefficient index for grading the significance levels of abrupt changes in a hydroclimate time series we first derive the relationship between the correlation coefficient and the degree of difference between before and after a change point supposing that a hydroclimate time series x i has a change point at a position ln and the original series can be segmented into two subseries x a and x b with the mean values of 1 x x 1 x 2 x n n 2 x a x 1 x 2 x n 1 n 1 3 x b x n 1 1 x n 1 2 x n n 2 where x x a and x b are the mean values of the series x i x a and x b with data lengths of n n 1 and n 2 respectively and n n 1 n 2 the difference between before and after the change point can be noted as x a x b we then generate a new series yi with yi x a i 1 2 n 1 and yi x b i n 1 1 n 1 2 n 1 n 2 the series yi reflects the abrupt change component in the original series x i the higher proportion of abrupt change component the more significant abrupt change in the series x i the mean value of series y i is the same as that of x i and can be expressed as 4 y x n 1 x a n 2 x b n then the correlation coefficient r between the series x i and y i can be described as murphy et al 2014 5 r i 1 n x i y i n x y i 1 n x i 2 n x 2 i 1 n y i 2 n y 2 some parts in eq 5 can be expressed as 6 i 1 n x i y i n 1 x a 2 n 2 x b 2 7 n x y n 1 2 x a 2 n 2 2 x b 2 2 n 1 n 2 x a x b n 8 i 1 n y i 2 n y 2 n 1 x a 2 n 2 x b 2 n n 1 x a n 2 x b n 2 9 i 1 n x i 2 n x 2 n σ x where σ x is the standard deviation of series x i 10 σ x 2 1 n i 1 n x i 2 x 2 by substituting eqs 6 9 into eq 5 we get the new equation of r 11 r n 1 n 2 x a x b n σ x the value of x a x b reflects the absolute difference of mean values before and after the change point however the relative difference is more needed to evaluate the statistical significance of the abrupt change in eq 11 the standard deviation σ x of series x i is closely related to the standard derivation σ xa σ xb of series x a x b 12 n 1 σ xa 2 n 2 σ xb 2 n σ x 2 n 1 n 2 n x a x b 2 13 with σ xa 2 1 n 1 i 1 n 1 y i 2 x a 2 and σ xb 2 1 n 2 i n 1 1 n y i 2 x b 2 then eq 11 can be rewritten as 14 r 1 n n 2 σ xa 2 n n 1 σ xb 2 x a x b 2 1 eq 14 indicates that the correlation coefficient r and the abrupt change x a x b keep a positive relationship but it is also influenced by the statistical characteristics of the series in order to further describe their influence on the correlation coefficient r we consider the change point position the difference of mean values between before and after the change point and difference of dispersion between before and after the change point described by the indicator α 1 α 2 and α 3 respectively 15 n 1 α 1 n and n 2 1 α 1 n 0 α 1 1 16 α 2 x b x a 17 α 3 cv xb cv xa σ xb x b σ xa x a where cv a and cv b are the coefficients of variation of two subseries with eqs 15 17 the correlation coefficient r in eq 14 can be described as 18 r 1 cv xa 2 α 1 1 α 1 α 2 2 α 3 2 α 1 1 α 1 1 α 2 2 1 eq 18 describes the relationship between the correlation coefficient r and the degree of difference of mean values between before and after a change point noted as α 2 when the indicator α 2 has a smaller value close to zero the series has a weak abrupt change and the absolute correlation coefficient r correspondingly has a value close to zero if indicator α 2 has a much bigger value the absolute correlation coefficient r would be close to unity and would reflect the obvious abrupt change besides eq 18 also describes the influence of change point position α 1 and the degree of dispersion α 3 of the series therefore it is thought that r can be a useful index for assessing the significance levels of abrupt changes in time series 2 2 gradation of significance levels of abrupt changes after getting eq 18 proper thresholds of the correlation coefficient r should be determined for the gradation of significance levels of acps in time series in general 95 or 99 confidence levels are widely used for hydrological time series analysis and thus the corresponding r values can be two important thresholds denoted as r 95 and r 99 furthermore the data length usually should be larger than 20 sample values for ensuring the reliability of hydrological time series analysis zhan and ye 2001 under this condition the r value would at most be 0 6 corder and foreman 2014 which can be another important threshold when considering the extreme situation of data length with only 10 samples the correlation coefficient r cannot be bigger than 0 8 and it also can be a threshold which can ensure the significance of correlation in all situations xie et al 2014 as a result we determined four thresholds of correlation coefficient r and then graded the significance levels of abrupt change in time series into five ranks no weak moderate strong and dramatic in table 1 a total of ten ranks was obtained by considering both positive and negative abrupt changes for investigating the acps in hydrological time series we computed their correlation coefficients r using eq 18 and checked which ranks they belonged to and further determined their significance levels 3 investigation into the efficiency of the proposed approach 3 1 design of statistical experiments we designed four groups of statistical experiments to validate the proposed approach and investigated the influence of several main factors on the significance of abrupt changes 1 generate 15 synthetic series using the monte carlo method which gives the best responses in parameter uncertainty analysis veihe and quinton 2015 each series has the same length n of 102 with a degree of freedom as 100 the abrupt change position is set at series midpoint i e α 1 0 5 the mean value x a of subseries before the change point is set as 500 and that after the change point increases from 250 to 1000 i e α 2 0 5 0 6 2 but α 2 1 the coefficient of variation cv xa is set as 0 2 and α 3 1 the skewness coefficient cs of series is set as 0 4 15 synthetic series are denoted as sj j 1 2 15 each series sj has one change point and was segmented into two subseries mean values of the two subseries compose the new series hj j 1 2 15 representing the abrupt change components sj hj just like x y in section 2 1 2 use eq 5 to calculate the correlation coefficient r between series sj and hj in each group 3 repeat steps 1 2 1000 times to get rjk j 1 2 15 k 1 2 1000 then obtain the average correlation coefficient in each group 19 r j 1 1000 k 1 1000 r jk j 1 2 15 4 because all components in these synthetic series are clearly known the real correlation coefficient can be directly calculated from eq 18 and the result is denoted as r j j 1 2 15 compute the relative error δ between rj and r j 20 δ r j r j r j 100 5 following general hydrological situations keep those values in step 1 but change a 1 0 75 in test 2 cv xa 0 3 in test 3 and a 3 1 5 in test 4 and repeat the above steps to investigate their separate influences on the results results of all statistical experiments are shown in table 2 with the relative error δ smaller than 2 88 therefore it is thought that the results obtained from eq 18 are reliable and the correlation coefficient can be used as an effective index to grade the significance levels of abrupt changes in a hydroclimate time series 3 2 influences of several factors on the gradation practice from eq 18 we know that the position of change point and statistical characteristics of the series would influence the r value and also influence the significance levels of abrupt changes here we further designed statistical experiments in table 3 to clarify the problem when considering the influence of change point position fig 1 indicates that the value of correlation coefficient somewhat varies with the change point position when the change point is close to the middle of the series it can be more significantly detected and the results would be more reliable and stable however if the change point moves to either of the two ends of a series the results become unsatisfactory and thus may be unreliable as a result it is noted that those abrupt change points detected from the ends of hydrological time series need to be carefully considered to confirm their reliability because one of the subseries will be too short to pass the hypothesis test which will result in error fig 2 shows that the differences of both mean value and variation coefficient before and after a change point influence the significance level of the abrupt change for a series with a bigger difference of mean values between before and after the change point it indicates a more significant abrupt change and bigger r values expectedly appear in fig 2 however for a series with bigger variation coefficient i e high dispersion degree smaller r values reflect weaker abrupt changes it can be due to the submergence of abrupt change into the obvious variations of series where the abrupt change point cannot be easily detected as a result the index of correlation coefficient r established in this study reflects not only the significance of abrupt changes in a hydrological time series but also the influence of statistical characteristics of the original series as shown in eq 18 therefore it is regarded that the index can be an effective approach for identifying and grading the significance levels of abrupt changes in a hydrological time series 4 detection of abrupt changes in precipitation and surface water resources amounts in china 4 1 study area and data used hydrological processes and water resources conditions in china exhibit spatial variability which is mainly caused by different climate and geographic conditions xu et al 2006 piao et al 2010 there are ten major watersheds covering china fig 3 the songhuajiang son river watershed the liaohe lia river watershed the haihe hai river watershed the yellow yel river watershed the huaihe hua river watershed the northwestern nwr rivers watershed the yangtze yan river watershed the pearl pea river watershed the southeastern ser rivers watershed and the southwestern swr rivers watershed due to water soil conservation projects entailing the construction of water infrastructure and drainage works as well as land use and cover change milley et al 2008 liu et al 2013 land surface conditions in these watersheds have been changing over recent decades which have caused changes in the precipitation runoff relationship and variability in streamflow regimes it would inevitably influence the utility and regulation of water resources at basin and national scales accurate detection of changes in hydrological processes is therefore essential for solving water resources problems there have been many studies for investigating the variability of hydrological processes in major watersheds in china sun et al 2006 zhang et al 2011 they were mainly concerned with the trends of precipitation and streamflow process at basin or national scales however studies attributing the causes of abrupt changes in hydrological processes especially runoff process at national scales were limited in this study we chose the above ten watersheds as study areas and used the proposed approach to detect the abrupt changes in the annual time series of precipitation and surface water resources amount swra of these watersheds comparing the differences of abrupt changes in precipitation and swra as well as their spatial differences we investigated the changes and their physical causes to achieve the objective we obtained the spatial average data of annual precipitation and swra of the ten watersheds from the china water resources bulletin http www mwr gov cn sj tjgb in chinese the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 2014 which had the same measurement periods of 1956 2014 with no missing segments 4 2 gradation of significance of abrupt changes in precipitation and swra we chose the moving t test which usually performs better than other methods rientjes et al 2011 to detect the abrupt change points in the annual time series of precipitation and swra for the moving t test the two subseries before and after the reference point were defined as x 1 and x 2 the test statistic was described as 21 t x 1 x 2 s 1 n 1 1 n 2 where 22 s n 1 s 1 2 n 2 s 2 2 n 1 n 2 2 x 1 and x 2 are the mean value of subseries x 1 with sample size n 1 and x 2 with sample size n 2 s 1 2 and s 2 2 are their variances if t t α α is the concerned confidence level the abrupt change is significant at the reference point otherwise there s no significant acp guo et al 2010 we used the proposed approach to calculate the correlation coefficient eq 18 between the original series and its abrupt change components where the 95 and 99 confidence levels corresponding to the correlation coefficient of 0 256 and 0 333 were used for the gradation of significance levels the results are summarized in table 4 indicating obviously spatial variability of abrupt changes no acp was identified in the annual precipitation and swra time series in the lia yan ser and swr river watersheds however acps with different significance levels can be identified in the annual precipitation and swra in the other six watersheds specifically in the songhuajiang river watershed annual precipitation did not exhibit significant abrupt changes during the last six decades but an abrupt down jump point with weak significance level was detected in 1965 in the annual swra series in the haihe river watershed the abrupt down jump point was detected in 1979 in both annual precipitation and swra with the same moderate significance level there was no significant acp in annual precipitation in the yellow river watershed however an abrupt down jump point with a moderate significance level occurred in 1990 in the corresponding annual swra in the huaihe river watershed an abrupt down jump point was detected in 1965 in both the annual precipitation and swra with the same weak significance level there was a difference between the abrupt change in annual precipitation and that in annual swra in the northwest inland river watershed an abrupt up jump point with a moderate significance level was identified in precipitation in 1986 but the abrupt up jump point with a strong significance level was identified in swra in 1997 in the pearl river watershed an abrupt up jump point with a moderate significance level was detected in annual precipitation in 2002 but no acp was identified in annual swra in the watershed for the convenience of comparison in fig 3 all precipitation and swra time series were normalized by removing their mean values and divided by their standard derivation values there occurred spatial differences of abrupt changes in annual precipitation and swra in the ten watersheds which showed the reasonableness of the abrupt change points detected the normalized annual swra series showed more obvious variations rather than the normalized annual precipitation in the northern part of china but they had similar variations in the southern part of china it indicates that runoff process in northern china is more sensitive to precipitation variation than in southern china further the abrupt changes in annual swra mainly occurred in the northern part of china i e the songhuajiang haihe huaihe yellow northwest inland river watersheds which has arid or semi arid climate and has severe water shortages and drought conditions a significant increase in water resources utility should be the major cause responsible for the steeper decline in streamflow than in precipitation in these watersheds zhang et al 2011 however there were no significant abrupt changes in swra in the southern part of china including the yangtze southeast southwest and pearl river watersheds 4 3 possible physical causes for abrupt changes in order to quantitatively demonstrate the precipitation runoff relationship and their abrupt changes we drew a linear relationship in fig 4 between the de mean accumulation precipitation and swra in the ten major watersheds because the de mean accumulation data could be positive or negative that is the data points may be above or below the average level harmonious relationship between annual precipitation and swra was found in the songhuajiang liaohe haihe huaihe yangtze southeastern and southwestern river watersheds their correlation coefficients in the yellow and northwestern river watersheds were larger than 0 74 r 2 0 55 therefore it was deduced that available water resources amounts in these watersheds were mainly determined by precipitation however abrupt changes in annual swra were more significant than those in precipitation especially in the northwest inland yellow and songhuajiang river watersheds it mainly reflects the influence of human activities particularly for those precipitation with insignificant abrupt changes in some regions such as the son and yel basins the corresponding swra abruptly changed more due to anthropogenic activities although they kept a close relationship and precipitation also attributed a small part to further quantify the contribution of precipitation change and human activities to the abrupt changes in surface water resources amounts in the five watersheds son hai yel hua nwr in northern china we used the method of calculating linear slope ratio of de mean accumulation to compare the difference of changes in precipitation and swra 23 c s pb s pa s pa s sb s sa s sa 100 where the linear slope of de mean accumulation precipitation before after the abrupt change point is denoted as s pa s pb and that for the swra data before after the abrupt change point is denoted as s sa s sb the indicator c quantifies the contribution of precipitation change to the abrupt change in swra and 1 c can approximately reflect the contribution of human activities table 5 for acp in annual swra in 1966 in the songhuajiang river watershed 29 07 can be attributed to precipitation change and 70 93 to human activities for the abrupt change in annual swra in 1979 in the haihe river watershed 27 59 was attributed to precipitation change and 72 41 to human activities for the abrupt change in annual swra in the yellow river watershed in 1990 20 72 can be attributed to precipitation change and 79 28 to human activities for the abrupt change in annual swra in 1965 in the huaihe river watershed 43 84 can be attributed to precipitation change and 56 16 to human activities in the northwest inland river watershed for the abrupt change in annual swra in 1997 51 16 can be attributed to precipitation change and 48 84 to human activities results indicated that the abrupt changes in annual swra in northern china were more caused by human activities rather than precipitation change except for the northwest inland river watershed over the last decades many large reservoirs were constructed and have been operating in these watersheds such as the fengman reservoir in the songhuajiang river watershed the yuecheng reservoir in the haihe river watershed the xiaolangdi reservoir in the yellow river watershed and the baisha reservoir in the huaihe river watershed these reservoirs combined with other various kinds of human activities together changed the precipitation runoff relationship and runoff regimes the physical causes for these abrupt changes can be explained as follows in the songhuajiang river watershed the total areas with soil conservation practices have been increasing since the 1960s wang et al 2015 which caused the downward abrupt change in swra in 1965 against the no change in precipitation during the late 1970s and early 1980s high intensive human activities by adding agricultural land and agricultural water resources utility especially the cultivated farmland that exceeded 25 yang and tian 2009 were the most probable driving causes of surface water resources decline in the haihe river watershed which is contradictory to the insignificant change in precipitation in the huaihe river watershed important reservoirs such as the shimantan banqiao and baisha reservoirs were constructed and have been operating since around 1965 and land use change decreased surface water and increased actual evapotranspiration shi et al 2013b for the yellow river watershed the decrease in runoff caused by hydraulic engineering works was about 2 3 times of that caused by soil conservation practices and both increased to a high level in the 1990s leading to an obvious abrupt decline in surface water resources in the same period shi et al 2013a in the northwest inland river watershed more significant abrupt increase in surface water resources in 1997 can be due to climate variability including both precipitation increase and increase in ice snow melt caused by global warming zhang et al 2015 chen et al 2013 for the abrupt increase in annual precipitation in the pearl river watershed there has been a fast economic development with increasing water consumption during recent decades guo et al 2017 yao 2004 thus precipitation increase did not cause a runoff increase in addition although many studies indicated significant trends of the runoff process at large time scales in the liaohe yangtze zhang et al 2006 southeast and southwest river watersheds jiang et al 2015 xu et al 2010 where no significant abrupt changes were detected 5 conclusions in this paper we developed an approach to evaluate the significance level of abrupt change in a hydroclimate time series based on an index of correlation coefficient in the proposed approach the relationship between the index of correlation coefficient and the abrupt change were mathematically derived by determining four key thresholds of the correlation coefficient we graded the significance of abrupt changes of time series at five levels no weak moderate strong and dramatic a bigger value of correlation coefficient reflects a higher significance level of abrupt changes monte carlo statistical experiments verified the proposed approach moreover they indicated that the position of abrupt change point relative difference of mean value and variance before and after the abrupt change point have a great influence on the significance level of the abrupt change the proposed approach was applied to investigate abrupt changes in surface water resources amounts and precipitation processes in ten major watersheds in china it was found that the abrupt changes mainly occurred in the watersheds of northern china with arid or semi arid climate and severe shortages of water resources although annual precipitation and runoff kept good consistency in most watersheds abrupt changes occurring in them have big differences compared with abrupt changes in annual precipitation abrupt changes in the corresponding swra were more significant mainly due to the influence of human activities along with the continuous increase in water resources utility it would cause more abrupt changes and decrease in water resources amounts in northern china in the coming decades and the occurrence of droughts would be aggravated to ensure the water supply safety at basin and national scales more effective and proactive adaptation strategies should be implemented to handle the unfavorable situation of water shortage in summary our results suggest that the significance of abrupt changes in hydrological processes influenced by statistical characteristics of series should be carefully evaluated which is favorable for understanding climate change and hydrological variability the correlation coefficient based approach developed in this study has the potential for wider use in hydrological and climate sciences more studies can be done by applying it to more basins with different climatic conditions to further confirm its applicability acknowledgments the authors gratefully acknowledged the valuable comments and suggestions given by

7354,abrupt changes are an important manifestation of hydrological variability how to accurately detect the abrupt changes in hydrological time series and evaluate their significance is an important issue but methods for dealing with them effectively are lacking in this study we propose an approach to evaluate the significance of abrupt changes in time series at five levels no weak moderate strong and dramatic the approach was based on an index of correlation coefficient calculated for the original time series and its abrupt change component a bigger value of correlation coefficient reflects a higher significance level of abrupt change results of monte carlo experiments verified the reliability of the proposed approach and also indicated the great influence of statistical characteristics of time series on the significance level of abrupt change the approach was derived from the relationship between correlation coefficient index and abrupt change and can estimate and grade the significance levels of abrupt changes in hydrological time series application of the proposed approach to ten major watersheds in china showed that abrupt changes mainly occurred in five watersheds in northern china which have arid or semi arid climate and severe shortages of water resources runoff processes in northern china were more sensitive to precipitation change than those in southern china although annual precipitation and surface water resources amount swra exhibited a harmonious relationship in most watersheds abrupt changes in the latter were more significant compared with abrupt changes in annual precipitation human activities contributed much more to the abrupt changes in the corresponding swra except for the northwest inland river watershed keywords hydrological variability abrupt change detection and attribution significance evaluation rainfall runoff relationship water resources utility 1 introduction climate change with global warming coupled with intensive human activities is alleged to be altering land surface conditions and causing significant variability in streamflow regimes in many basins and regions worldwide bates et al 2008 berghuijs et al 2015 teutschbein et al 2015 the construction and operation of water conservancy projects dams channel modifications drainage works etc especially have changed the seasonal distribution of and have caused abrupt changes in streamflow at basin scales vörösmarty et al 2000 poff et al 2015 griffin 2016 how to attribute the physical causes of hydrological variability and how to accurately detect the human caused signals from the natural hydrological variability are therefore important questions mccabe and wolock 2002 rosenzweig and neofotis 2013 mccuen 2016 understanding the hydrological variability is needed first to answer these questions as well as for hydrological simulation and forecasting water resources management control of water disasters and many other water activities varis et al 2004 however accurate detection and attribution of complex variability in hydrological processes at multi time scales is still a challenging task ganguli and ganguly 2016 supratid et al 2017 and the difficulty has not been resolved although many methods that are used presently zhang et al 2014 lloyd et al 2014 an abrupt change is one of the important external manifestation of the variability of hydroclimate process wong et al 2006 rougé et al 2013 nayak and villarini 2016 and it mainly reflects the occurrence of an extreme event or a severe anthropogenic activity wagener et al 2010 detection of abrupt change point acp is also the first issue to be tackled for hydrological time series analysis lest their existence would influence the identification of trend and periodicities sang 2013 sang et al 2015 there have been a large number of methods for detecting acps in time series brodsky and darkhovsky 2013 perreault et al 2000 such as moving t test welch 1947 moving f test jackson et al 2017 mann kendall test kisi and ay 2014 and pettitt test pettitt 1979 based on their different mathematical hypotheses and scopes of application these methods can be divided as parametric and non parametric stuart et al 2010 generally all methods for the detection of acps have advantages and weaknesses lloyd et al 2014 jeon et al 2016 turner et al 2016 and they cannot sufficiently meet practical needs one pesky problem in the detection of acps is how to quantitatively assess their statistical significance although the methods used presently set a certain statistical threshold to judge if a change point is significant or not such as 0 5 in pettitt test pettitt 1979 the characteristic indices in these tests usually have large value ranges from negative to positive infinity sometimes when using these thresholds the classification of significance levels becomes crude and the degree of abrupt changes cannot be directly estimated which is unfavorable for the assessment of impact and risk of potential consequences caused by the abrupt changes moreover the detection of acps not only depends on the absolute difference between before and after the change point but also is impacted by statistical characteristics of the original series such as sample size and degree of dispersion villarini et al 2009 therefore accurately identifying and assessing the significance levels of acps in hydroclimate time series is still an open question a specific gradation of the significance levels of acps is therefore needed and the factors that influence the gradation should be determined too in order to accurately assess and grade the significance levels of acps in hydroclimate time series an effective index should be defined the index should clearly show the degree of difference between before and after the change point and should indicate the influence of other factors on the detection such as change point position and dispersion of the series considering that acps are just one part of the original time series we can quantify the correlation between the abrupt change component and original series a bigger correlation coefficient in general would represent a bigger proportion of abrupt change component in the original series the correlation coefficient has a value range of 1 1 and its value at a given confidence level can be mathematically determined troch et al 2013 mccuen 2016 therefore the correlation coefficient could be considered as an effective index for grading the significance levels of abrupt changes in hydroclimate time series the objective of this study therefore is to employ the correlation coefficient as an index to develop an approach to grading the significance levels of acps in hydroclimate time series with an example of abrupt changes in precipitation and surface water resources amounts over china to do that section 2 formulates the relationship between correlation coefficient and degree of difference before and after the change point and then develops an approach to the gradation of significance levels of acps in time series in section 3 synthetic series data generated by monte carlo simulation are used as examples to verify the proposed approach and investigate the influence of several main factors the approach is applied to investigate the abrupt changes in precipitation and surface water resources amounts in ten major watersheds over china in section 4 followed by conclusions finally 2 method proposed for grading significance levels of abrupt changes 2 1 derivation of relationship between correlation coefficient and abrupt change in order to confirm the effectiveness of the correlation coefficient index for grading the significance levels of abrupt changes in a hydroclimate time series we first derive the relationship between the correlation coefficient and the degree of difference between before and after a change point supposing that a hydroclimate time series x i has a change point at a position ln and the original series can be segmented into two subseries x a and x b with the mean values of 1 x x 1 x 2 x n n 2 x a x 1 x 2 x n 1 n 1 3 x b x n 1 1 x n 1 2 x n n 2 where x x a and x b are the mean values of the series x i x a and x b with data lengths of n n 1 and n 2 respectively and n n 1 n 2 the difference between before and after the change point can be noted as x a x b we then generate a new series yi with yi x a i 1 2 n 1 and yi x b i n 1 1 n 1 2 n 1 n 2 the series yi reflects the abrupt change component in the original series x i the higher proportion of abrupt change component the more significant abrupt change in the series x i the mean value of series y i is the same as that of x i and can be expressed as 4 y x n 1 x a n 2 x b n then the correlation coefficient r between the series x i and y i can be described as murphy et al 2014 5 r i 1 n x i y i n x y i 1 n x i 2 n x 2 i 1 n y i 2 n y 2 some parts in eq 5 can be expressed as 6 i 1 n x i y i n 1 x a 2 n 2 x b 2 7 n x y n 1 2 x a 2 n 2 2 x b 2 2 n 1 n 2 x a x b n 8 i 1 n y i 2 n y 2 n 1 x a 2 n 2 x b 2 n n 1 x a n 2 x b n 2 9 i 1 n x i 2 n x 2 n σ x where σ x is the standard deviation of series x i 10 σ x 2 1 n i 1 n x i 2 x 2 by substituting eqs 6 9 into eq 5 we get the new equation of r 11 r n 1 n 2 x a x b n σ x the value of x a x b reflects the absolute difference of mean values before and after the change point however the relative difference is more needed to evaluate the statistical significance of the abrupt change in eq 11 the standard deviation σ x of series x i is closely related to the standard derivation σ xa σ xb of series x a x b 12 n 1 σ xa 2 n 2 σ xb 2 n σ x 2 n 1 n 2 n x a x b 2 13 with σ xa 2 1 n 1 i 1 n 1 y i 2 x a 2 and σ xb 2 1 n 2 i n 1 1 n y i 2 x b 2 then eq 11 can be rewritten as 14 r 1 n n 2 σ xa 2 n n 1 σ xb 2 x a x b 2 1 eq 14 indicates that the correlation coefficient r and the abrupt change x a x b keep a positive relationship but it is also influenced by the statistical characteristics of the series in order to further describe their influence on the correlation coefficient r we consider the change point position the difference of mean values between before and after the change point and difference of dispersion between before and after the change point described by the indicator α 1 α 2 and α 3 respectively 15 n 1 α 1 n and n 2 1 α 1 n 0 α 1 1 16 α 2 x b x a 17 α 3 cv xb cv xa σ xb x b σ xa x a where cv a and cv b are the coefficients of variation of two subseries with eqs 15 17 the correlation coefficient r in eq 14 can be described as 18 r 1 cv xa 2 α 1 1 α 1 α 2 2 α 3 2 α 1 1 α 1 1 α 2 2 1 eq 18 describes the relationship between the correlation coefficient r and the degree of difference of mean values between before and after a change point noted as α 2 when the indicator α 2 has a smaller value close to zero the series has a weak abrupt change and the absolute correlation coefficient r correspondingly has a value close to zero if indicator α 2 has a much bigger value the absolute correlation coefficient r would be close to unity and would reflect the obvious abrupt change besides eq 18 also describes the influence of change point position α 1 and the degree of dispersion α 3 of the series therefore it is thought that r can be a useful index for assessing the significance levels of abrupt changes in time series 2 2 gradation of significance levels of abrupt changes after getting eq 18 proper thresholds of the correlation coefficient r should be determined for the gradation of significance levels of acps in time series in general 95 or 99 confidence levels are widely used for hydrological time series analysis and thus the corresponding r values can be two important thresholds denoted as r 95 and r 99 furthermore the data length usually should be larger than 20 sample values for ensuring the reliability of hydrological time series analysis zhan and ye 2001 under this condition the r value would at most be 0 6 corder and foreman 2014 which can be another important threshold when considering the extreme situation of data length with only 10 samples the correlation coefficient r cannot be bigger than 0 8 and it also can be a threshold which can ensure the significance of correlation in all situations xie et al 2014 as a result we determined four thresholds of correlation coefficient r and then graded the significance levels of abrupt change in time series into five ranks no weak moderate strong and dramatic in table 1 a total of ten ranks was obtained by considering both positive and negative abrupt changes for investigating the acps in hydrological time series we computed their correlation coefficients r using eq 18 and checked which ranks they belonged to and further determined their significance levels 3 investigation into the efficiency of the proposed approach 3 1 design of statistical experiments we designed four groups of statistical experiments to validate the proposed approach and investigated the influence of several main factors on the significance of abrupt changes 1 generate 15 synthetic series using the monte carlo method which gives the best responses in parameter uncertainty analysis veihe and quinton 2015 each series has the same length n of 102 with a degree of freedom as 100 the abrupt change position is set at series midpoint i e α 1 0 5 the mean value x a of subseries before the change point is set as 500 and that after the change point increases from 250 to 1000 i e α 2 0 5 0 6 2 but α 2 1 the coefficient of variation cv xa is set as 0 2 and α 3 1 the skewness coefficient cs of series is set as 0 4 15 synthetic series are denoted as sj j 1 2 15 each series sj has one change point and was segmented into two subseries mean values of the two subseries compose the new series hj j 1 2 15 representing the abrupt change components sj hj just like x y in section 2 1 2 use eq 5 to calculate the correlation coefficient r between series sj and hj in each group 3 repeat steps 1 2 1000 times to get rjk j 1 2 15 k 1 2 1000 then obtain the average correlation coefficient in each group 19 r j 1 1000 k 1 1000 r jk j 1 2 15 4 because all components in these synthetic series are clearly known the real correlation coefficient can be directly calculated from eq 18 and the result is denoted as r j j 1 2 15 compute the relative error δ between rj and r j 20 δ r j r j r j 100 5 following general hydrological situations keep those values in step 1 but change a 1 0 75 in test 2 cv xa 0 3 in test 3 and a 3 1 5 in test 4 and repeat the above steps to investigate their separate influences on the results results of all statistical experiments are shown in table 2 with the relative error δ smaller than 2 88 therefore it is thought that the results obtained from eq 18 are reliable and the correlation coefficient can be used as an effective index to grade the significance levels of abrupt changes in a hydroclimate time series 3 2 influences of several factors on the gradation practice from eq 18 we know that the position of change point and statistical characteristics of the series would influence the r value and also influence the significance levels of abrupt changes here we further designed statistical experiments in table 3 to clarify the problem when considering the influence of change point position fig 1 indicates that the value of correlation coefficient somewhat varies with the change point position when the change point is close to the middle of the series it can be more significantly detected and the results would be more reliable and stable however if the change point moves to either of the two ends of a series the results become unsatisfactory and thus may be unreliable as a result it is noted that those abrupt change points detected from the ends of hydrological time series need to be carefully considered to confirm their reliability because one of the subseries will be too short to pass the hypothesis test which will result in error fig 2 shows that the differences of both mean value and variation coefficient before and after a change point influence the significance level of the abrupt change for a series with a bigger difference of mean values between before and after the change point it indicates a more significant abrupt change and bigger r values expectedly appear in fig 2 however for a series with bigger variation coefficient i e high dispersion degree smaller r values reflect weaker abrupt changes it can be due to the submergence of abrupt change into the obvious variations of series where the abrupt change point cannot be easily detected as a result the index of correlation coefficient r established in this study reflects not only the significance of abrupt changes in a hydrological time series but also the influence of statistical characteristics of the original series as shown in eq 18 therefore it is regarded that the index can be an effective approach for identifying and grading the significance levels of abrupt changes in a hydrological time series 4 detection of abrupt changes in precipitation and surface water resources amounts in china 4 1 study area and data used hydrological processes and water resources conditions in china exhibit spatial variability which is mainly caused by different climate and geographic conditions xu et al 2006 piao et al 2010 there are ten major watersheds covering china fig 3 the songhuajiang son river watershed the liaohe lia river watershed the haihe hai river watershed the yellow yel river watershed the huaihe hua river watershed the northwestern nwr rivers watershed the yangtze yan river watershed the pearl pea river watershed the southeastern ser rivers watershed and the southwestern swr rivers watershed due to water soil conservation projects entailing the construction of water infrastructure and drainage works as well as land use and cover change milley et al 2008 liu et al 2013 land surface conditions in these watersheds have been changing over recent decades which have caused changes in the precipitation runoff relationship and variability in streamflow regimes it would inevitably influence the utility and regulation of water resources at basin and national scales accurate detection of changes in hydrological processes is therefore essential for solving water resources problems there have been many studies for investigating the variability of hydrological processes in major watersheds in china sun et al 2006 zhang et al 2011 they were mainly concerned with the trends of precipitation and streamflow process at basin or national scales however studies attributing the causes of abrupt changes in hydrological processes especially runoff process at national scales were limited in this study we chose the above ten watersheds as study areas and used the proposed approach to detect the abrupt changes in the annual time series of precipitation and surface water resources amount swra of these watersheds comparing the differences of abrupt changes in precipitation and swra as well as their spatial differences we investigated the changes and their physical causes to achieve the objective we obtained the spatial average data of annual precipitation and swra of the ten watersheds from the china water resources bulletin http www mwr gov cn sj tjgb in chinese the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 2014 which had the same measurement periods of 1956 2014 with no missing segments 4 2 gradation of significance of abrupt changes in precipitation and swra we chose the moving t test which usually performs better than other methods rientjes et al 2011 to detect the abrupt change points in the annual time series of precipitation and swra for the moving t test the two subseries before and after the reference point were defined as x 1 and x 2 the test statistic was described as 21 t x 1 x 2 s 1 n 1 1 n 2 where 22 s n 1 s 1 2 n 2 s 2 2 n 1 n 2 2 x 1 and x 2 are the mean value of subseries x 1 with sample size n 1 and x 2 with sample size n 2 s 1 2 and s 2 2 are their variances if t t α α is the concerned confidence level the abrupt change is significant at the reference point otherwise there s no significant acp guo et al 2010 we used the proposed approach to calculate the correlation coefficient eq 18 between the original series and its abrupt change components where the 95 and 99 confidence levels corresponding to the correlation coefficient of 0 256 and 0 333 were used for the gradation of significance levels the results are summarized in table 4 indicating obviously spatial variability of abrupt changes no acp was identified in the annual precipitation and swra time series in the lia yan ser and swr river watersheds however acps with different significance levels can be identified in the annual precipitation and swra in the other six watersheds specifically in the songhuajiang river watershed annual precipitation did not exhibit significant abrupt changes during the last six decades but an abrupt down jump point with weak significance level was detected in 1965 in the annual swra series in the haihe river watershed the abrupt down jump point was detected in 1979 in both annual precipitation and swra with the same moderate significance level there was no significant acp in annual precipitation in the yellow river watershed however an abrupt down jump point with a moderate significance level occurred in 1990 in the corresponding annual swra in the huaihe river watershed an abrupt down jump point was detected in 1965 in both the annual precipitation and swra with the same weak significance level there was a difference between the abrupt change in annual precipitation and that in annual swra in the northwest inland river watershed an abrupt up jump point with a moderate significance level was identified in precipitation in 1986 but the abrupt up jump point with a strong significance level was identified in swra in 1997 in the pearl river watershed an abrupt up jump point with a moderate significance level was detected in annual precipitation in 2002 but no acp was identified in annual swra in the watershed for the convenience of comparison in fig 3 all precipitation and swra time series were normalized by removing their mean values and divided by their standard derivation values there occurred spatial differences of abrupt changes in annual precipitation and swra in the ten watersheds which showed the reasonableness of the abrupt change points detected the normalized annual swra series showed more obvious variations rather than the normalized annual precipitation in the northern part of china but they had similar variations in the southern part of china it indicates that runoff process in northern china is more sensitive to precipitation variation than in southern china further the abrupt changes in annual swra mainly occurred in the northern part of china i e the songhuajiang haihe huaihe yellow northwest inland river watersheds which has arid or semi arid climate and has severe water shortages and drought conditions a significant increase in water resources utility should be the major cause responsible for the steeper decline in streamflow than in precipitation in these watersheds zhang et al 2011 however there were no significant abrupt changes in swra in the southern part of china including the yangtze southeast southwest and pearl river watersheds 4 3 possible physical causes for abrupt changes in order to quantitatively demonstrate the precipitation runoff relationship and their abrupt changes we drew a linear relationship in fig 4 between the de mean accumulation precipitation and swra in the ten major watersheds because the de mean accumulation data could be positive or negative that is the data points may be above or below the average level harmonious relationship between annual precipitation and swra was found in the songhuajiang liaohe haihe huaihe yangtze southeastern and southwestern river watersheds their correlation coefficients in the yellow and northwestern river watersheds were larger than 0 74 r 2 0 55 therefore it was deduced that available water resources amounts in these watersheds were mainly determined by precipitation however abrupt changes in annual swra were more significant than those in precipitation especially in the northwest inland yellow and songhuajiang river watersheds it mainly reflects the influence of human activities particularly for those precipitation with insignificant abrupt changes in some regions such as the son and yel basins the corresponding swra abruptly changed more due to anthropogenic activities although they kept a close relationship and precipitation also attributed a small part to further quantify the contribution of precipitation change and human activities to the abrupt changes in surface water resources amounts in the five watersheds son hai yel hua nwr in northern china we used the method of calculating linear slope ratio of de mean accumulation to compare the difference of changes in precipitation and swra 23 c s pb s pa s pa s sb s sa s sa 100 where the linear slope of de mean accumulation precipitation before after the abrupt change point is denoted as s pa s pb and that for the swra data before after the abrupt change point is denoted as s sa s sb the indicator c quantifies the contribution of precipitation change to the abrupt change in swra and 1 c can approximately reflect the contribution of human activities table 5 for acp in annual swra in 1966 in the songhuajiang river watershed 29 07 can be attributed to precipitation change and 70 93 to human activities for the abrupt change in annual swra in 1979 in the haihe river watershed 27 59 was attributed to precipitation change and 72 41 to human activities for the abrupt change in annual swra in the yellow river watershed in 1990 20 72 can be attributed to precipitation change and 79 28 to human activities for the abrupt change in annual swra in 1965 in the huaihe river watershed 43 84 can be attributed to precipitation change and 56 16 to human activities in the northwest inland river watershed for the abrupt change in annual swra in 1997 51 16 can be attributed to precipitation change and 48 84 to human activities results indicated that the abrupt changes in annual swra in northern china were more caused by human activities rather than precipitation change except for the northwest inland river watershed over the last decades many large reservoirs were constructed and have been operating in these watersheds such as the fengman reservoir in the songhuajiang river watershed the yuecheng reservoir in the haihe river watershed the xiaolangdi reservoir in the yellow river watershed and the baisha reservoir in the huaihe river watershed these reservoirs combined with other various kinds of human activities together changed the precipitation runoff relationship and runoff regimes the physical causes for these abrupt changes can be explained as follows in the songhuajiang river watershed the total areas with soil conservation practices have been increasing since the 1960s wang et al 2015 which caused the downward abrupt change in swra in 1965 against the no change in precipitation during the late 1970s and early 1980s high intensive human activities by adding agricultural land and agricultural water resources utility especially the cultivated farmland that exceeded 25 yang and tian 2009 were the most probable driving causes of surface water resources decline in the haihe river watershed which is contradictory to the insignificant change in precipitation in the huaihe river watershed important reservoirs such as the shimantan banqiao and baisha reservoirs were constructed and have been operating since around 1965 and land use change decreased surface water and increased actual evapotranspiration shi et al 2013b for the yellow river watershed the decrease in runoff caused by hydraulic engineering works was about 2 3 times of that caused by soil conservation practices and both increased to a high level in the 1990s leading to an obvious abrupt decline in surface water resources in the same period shi et al 2013a in the northwest inland river watershed more significant abrupt increase in surface water resources in 1997 can be due to climate variability including both precipitation increase and increase in ice snow melt caused by global warming zhang et al 2015 chen et al 2013 for the abrupt increase in annual precipitation in the pearl river watershed there has been a fast economic development with increasing water consumption during recent decades guo et al 2017 yao 2004 thus precipitation increase did not cause a runoff increase in addition although many studies indicated significant trends of the runoff process at large time scales in the liaohe yangtze zhang et al 2006 southeast and southwest river watersheds jiang et al 2015 xu et al 2010 where no significant abrupt changes were detected 5 conclusions in this paper we developed an approach to evaluate the significance level of abrupt change in a hydroclimate time series based on an index of correlation coefficient in the proposed approach the relationship between the index of correlation coefficient and the abrupt change were mathematically derived by determining four key thresholds of the correlation coefficient we graded the significance of abrupt changes of time series at five levels no weak moderate strong and dramatic a bigger value of correlation coefficient reflects a higher significance level of abrupt changes monte carlo statistical experiments verified the proposed approach moreover they indicated that the position of abrupt change point relative difference of mean value and variance before and after the abrupt change point have a great influence on the significance level of the abrupt change the proposed approach was applied to investigate abrupt changes in surface water resources amounts and precipitation processes in ten major watersheds in china it was found that the abrupt changes mainly occurred in the watersheds of northern china with arid or semi arid climate and severe shortages of water resources although annual precipitation and runoff kept good consistency in most watersheds abrupt changes occurring in them have big differences compared with abrupt changes in annual precipitation abrupt changes in the corresponding swra were more significant mainly due to the influence of human activities along with the continuous increase in water resources utility it would cause more abrupt changes and decrease in water resources amounts in northern china in the coming decades and the occurrence of droughts would be aggravated to ensure the water supply safety at basin and national scales more effective and proactive adaptation strategies should be implemented to handle the unfavorable situation of water shortage in summary our results suggest that the significance of abrupt changes in hydrological processes influenced by statistical characteristics of series should be carefully evaluated which is favorable for understanding climate change and hydrological variability the correlation coefficient based approach developed in this study has the potential for wider use in hydrological and climate sciences more studies can be done by applying it to more basins with different climatic conditions to further confirm its applicability acknowledgments the authors gratefully acknowledged the valuable comments and suggestions given by
