18350,the effect of watershed characteristics land use land cover and morphology on spatial variability in dissolved organic matter dom composition and concentrations of dissolved organic carbon doc and nitrogen don was assessed in a coastal river basin draining into pamlico sound in eastern north carolina usa understanding the factors that influence dom concentration and composition i e structurally complex molecules with high molecular weight versus low molecular weight simple molecules can provide insights on dom cycling and water composition implications such information is imperative for large coastal river networks undergoing rapid and intense land use and land cover lulc changes dom composition was estimated using optical indices calculated from dom absorbance and fluorescence measurements dom was derived from terrestrial sources and ordination analysis indicated that lulc in particular wetland area was the most significant control on dom composition and concentration wetland and agricultural coastal streams were abundant in humic and complex dom whereas forested and urban streams were least abundant in humic dom we speculate that greater availability of mobilizable dom in wetland and agricultural watersheds contributed to this observation in comparison mixed urbanized and forested streams in north carolina s piedmont region were abundant in doc less complex low molecular weight dom as well as greater amounts don due to higher urban runoff and elevated dom production in these streams our results indicated that physiographic transition from piedmont to coastal plain and varying lulc influenced the spatial variability in dom composition and concentration our findings highlight that increasing anthropogenic alterations might increase the abundance of reactive dom in coastal rivers and estuaries resulting in severe water quality issues this information is important for monitoring and developing land use policies graphical abstract

division of water quality 1 introduction dissolved organic matter dom is a major factor influencing the water quality and trophic status of aquatic ecosystems fellman et al 2010 spencer et al 2012 dissolved organic matter serves as an important nutrient source of dissolved organic carbon doc and dissolved organic nitrogen don dom is a fundamental limit on microbial respiration in aquatic ecosystems enhanced microbial respiration can lead to greenhouse gas emissions hypoxia and internal nutrient loading resulting in fish kills and formation of harmful algal blooms del giorgio and williams 2005 paerl et al 2006 dom may also limit primary productivity in aquatic environments by attenuating light and therefore influencing the overall carbon c cycling in aquatic ecosystems bernhardt and likens 2012 further dom can transport agricultural pollutants and heavy metals and leads to the formation of disinfection byproducts during drinking water treatment hudson et al 2007 kaushal et al 2014 factors such as prominent land use and watershed characteristics can substantially affect dom sources nadon et al 2015 osburn et al 2016a petrone et al 2011 williams et al 2010 in general dom in aquatic ecosystems is derived from two types of sources allochthonous and autochthonous allochthonous dom is terrestrially derived humic and aromatic in nature mobilized from the watershed to stream during precipitation runoff events raymond et al 2016 singh et al 2016 conversely autochthonous dom is mostly contributed by primary production by phytoplankton and submerged aquatic vegetation tzortziou et al 2010 yamashita and tanoue 2004 and also transformed by microbial and photochemical degradation cory et al 2018 depending on the source dom may also vary in terms of its composition for instance terrestrially derived dom is generally more recalcitrant structurally complex with high molecular weight and aromaticity whereas in stream produced or transformed dom may be a readily available simple molecule with low molecular weight and aromaticity fellman et al 2010 most previous studies of land use and land cover lulc drivers on dom composition have been conducted in small headwater streams where anthropogenic lulc has significant effects on dom source and composition fellman et al 2010 graeber et al 2012 in forested watersheds upper soil horizons and leaf debris tend to contribute low molecular weight reactive dom molecules to the streams singh et al 2012 in urban and agricultural watersheds impervious surfaces crop detritus and upper soils might contribute terrestrial humic slightly higher molecular weight yet reactive dom that can also promote in stream dom production and microbial processing hansen et al 2016 kaushal et al 2014 osburn et al 2016b royer and david 2005 conversely in wetlands organic matter rich soils and sub surface water pools contribute humic complex and recalcitrant terrestrial dom that may limit in stream productivity fellman et al 2010 yamashita et al 2010 a basin scale understanding of dom dynamics in coastal rivers that drain into ecologically significant estuaries is still needed to mitigate the influence of future anthropogenic and climatic perturbations on dom cycling coastal river networks are increasingly threatened by anthropogenic disturbances including agricultural intensification urbanization and population expansion martínez et al 2007 issues such as the formation of harmful algal blooms and fish kills are becoming more frequent and intense in the face of global climate and anthropogenic changes and significantly diminishing the ecological and economic services provided by coastal ecosystems barbier et al 2011 martínez et al 2007 paerl et al 2018 thus understanding the factors that influence dom cycling in large coastal river networks is critical to better manage these ecosystems and to forecast their responses to rapid and intense lulc changes the objective of this study was to utilize dom optical indices to examine the influences of watershed characteristics e g regional lulc watershed area and slope on spatial dom dynamics in the neuse river basin a coastal river network in eastern north carolina usa that drains into the pamlico sound the second largest estuarine complex in north america and its largest lagoonal complex both absorbance and fluorescence of dom were used as established approaches for assessing its source and composition in freshwaters fellman et al 2010 jaffé et al 2008 spencer et al 2013 we hypothesized that the dom source would vary with watershed characteristics influencing its concentration and composition along throughout the river network specifically we predicted that dom would increase in molecular complexity and molecular weight along the gradient of lulc urban agriculture forested wetland we also predicted that abundant wetlands in larger low elevation watersheds located within the lower coastal plain would result in more transport of complex terrestrial dom than the smaller higher elevation watersheds located in piedmont to upper coastal plain areas in neuse river basin each of which has lower abundance of wetlands 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the neuse river basin is the largest watershed 16 000 km2 in the state of north carolina usa the neuse river originates in northern piedmont at an altitude of 183 m and flows 320 km southeast through the upper and lower coastal plains to the pamlico sound at sea level christian et al 1991 supplementary information si fig 1 si table 1 us geological survey usgs gauges monitor discharge at several sites on the main stem of the river and on many of the river s tributaries fort barnwell usgs 02091814 is the last site in the neuse river basin prior to head of tide of the estuary the upper neuse river consists of several urban regions e g the raleigh durham metropolitan area while the lower neuse river watershed is largely comprised of agricultural areas with smaller urban areas national land cover data nldc 2011 north carolina division of water quality ncdwq 2009 confined animal feeding operations cafos are prevalent throughout the middle and lower portions of the neuse river basin ncdwq 2009 overall the neuse river and its estuary are affected by substantial loading of doc and bioavailable don from nonpoint sources including runoff from row crop agriculture silviculture and cafos as well as point sources such as discharges of treated wastewaters from municipal and industrial facilities e g lebo et al 2012 osburn et al 2016b stow et al 2001 thus the neuse river basin is an ideal setting for examining how physiography anthropogenic disturbances and watershed characteristics affect dom composition in a large coastal ecosystem 2 2 sampling and analyses water samples were collected approximately bi weekly from aug 2011 to april 2013 at the four sampling stations along the main stem of neuse river and at the outlet of its five tributaries approximately monthly by lower neuse river basin association lnba and north carolina division of water resources ncdwr si fig 1 samples were collected generally during base flow samples were stored at 4 c in dark conditions until they were analyzed at the biogeochemistry laboratory at n c state university the water samples were vacuum filtered typically on the day of collection using a pre combusted 450 c for 6 h 0 7 μm glass fiber filter whatman gf f to collect dom filtered samples were kept refrigerated and analyzed within 1 2 days of collection osburn et al 2016b a total of 245 samples were collected for this study and all of the water samples were analyzed for dom optical properties absorbance and fluorescence and doc a subset of the total samples mostly from the main stem of the neuse river and the two larger sub watersheds were analyzed for smaller subset don n 103 subsequently doc don ratios were only calculated for these four watersheds absorbance was measured in 1 cm quartz cells starna cells inc on a varian 300uv spectrophotometer against air laboratory water milli q 18 mω resistivity was used as a blank samples were diluted to achieve an optical density of 0 4 at 240 nm fluorescence was measured on a varian eclipse spectrophotometer also using milli q as a blank lamp intensity for fluorescence was either at 800 or 950 v depending on the sample response excitation ex wavelengths ranged from 240 to 450 nm at 5 nm intervals while emission em wavelengths were sampled at 2 nm intervals from 300 to 600 nm scans were made at the same dilution as absorbance the fluorescence measurements were then corrected for any subsequent inner filter effects tucker et al 1992 fluorescence was then calibrated against the instrument s water raman signal and standardized to quinine sulfate units ppb qsu where 1 qsu 1 μg l 1 quinine sulfate in 0 1 m h2so4 lawaetz and stedmon 2008 absorbance and fluorescence results were re scaled based on dilution factors as appropriate after the measurement of optical properties samples were acidified with 85 h3po4 and stored in the dark prior to doc analysis samples were pre sparged with ultrapure helium to remove inorganic carbon doc was measured using wet chemical oxidation in an oi analytical 1030 toc aurora toc analyzer osburn and st jean 2007 further don was calculated as the difference between total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn and sums ammonium and particulate nitrogen per standard methods 4500 norg apha 2005 for method details please see osburn et al 2016b and si table 2 2 3 dissolved organic matter composition the dom composition was explored using several optical indices the napierian absorption coefficient at 254 nm a254 was chosen to quantify the colored dom content cdom specific uv absorption at 254 nm suva25 a measure of dom aromaticity was calculated as the ratio between absorbance at 254 nm and doc concentration a254 doc weishaar et al 2003 spectral slopes s for the intervals 275 295 and 350 400 nm s 275 295 and s 350 400 were determined from the linear regression of the log transformed absorption spectra versus wavelength the slope ratio s r was calculated as the ratio of s 275 295 to s 350 400 and is used as an indicator of the molecular weight distribution of dom with values less than 1 indicative of enrichment in higher molecular weight compounds and values above 1 indicative of a higher degree of low molecular weight compounds helms et al 2008 we also calculated the index of the relative degree of humification hix and the index of recent biological productivity contribution bix zsolnay et al 1999 huguet et al 2009 hix is the ratio of fluorescence emitted at 435 480 nm to that emitted at 300 345 nm at excitation 254 nm high fluorescence hix values correspond to high fluorescence emission at longer wavelengths indicating larger contributions from complex molecules and high mw aromatics huguet et al 2009 specifically hix values ranging from 1 to 2 are associated with non humified material and values 10 are typical for fulvic acid extracts zsolnay et al 1999 bix is calculated as the fluorescence emitted at 380 nm divided by the fluorescence emitted at 430 nm at 310 nm excitation tzortziou et al 2015 both doc and don can have multiple sources degradability and bio availability which influences their transport from the watershed to the stream hence the ratio between doc and don has been used as an indicator of organic matter source and processing fellman et al 2010 lee et al 2018 in this study we used doc don ratios as an indicator for terrestrial dom input from the watersheds to the streams perdue and koprivnjak 2007 2 4 watershed characteristics analysis arcgis spatial analysis toolbox was used to estimate the watershed characteristics e g morphology and land use and land cover from the national hydrography dataset nhdlusv1 2003 land use and land cover lulc were estimated from the nlcd 2011 the nlcd 2011 was reclassified into four main groups forest agriculture urban and wetland for simplicity si fig 1 while consolidating the lulc groups no watershed lulc types were excluded except open water which constituted 1 area in each watershed the of lulc were calculated for each sub watershed and the entire basin see bhattacharya and osburn 2017 for details see si table 1 we selected nine sub watersheds including the main stem of the neuse river and its five tributaries to represent a gradient of lulc and morphology si fig 1 si table 1 2 5 statistical analyses the distribution of dom optical indices as a measure of dom composition were checked by q q plots and histograms parameters were centered scaled and log transformed log10 n 10 to achieve a normal distribution linear regressions were conducted for outlier identification plots of standardized residuals vs leverage hat value with an influence measure cook s distance were used to identify the outliers observations with cook s distance three times greater than the mean were removed prior to the regression based analyses to ensure normal distribution of data cook and weisberg 1982 dom composition was tested with respect to watershed variability and seasonal variability using one dimensional analysis of variance anova and tukey s honest significance difference hsd a single step multiple comparison statistical test the relation between optical indices and explanatory variables i e lulc watershed area and slope were determined by redundancy analysis rda to identify a minimum subset of significant variables that can explain variations in the optical properties first we assessed the multicollinearity in the data using variance inflation factor vif in which variables with vif greater than 10 were removed second a parsimonious model was selected through step wise regression with monte carlo permutation tests ter braak and smilauer 2002 we then conducted variance partitioning to explore the percent variance uniquely explained by each variable further the rda axes scores were compared to the doc don ratios to explore if the c and nitrogen n bearing dom varied with the dom composition and explanatory variables the rda was conducted using vegan 2 3 1 package in the r statistical software environment 3 results 3 1 characteristics of the neuse river basin and its sub watersheds the sub watersheds in the neuse river basin are variable and mixed in terms of the prominent lulc si fig 1 the nine sub watersheds including the main stem of neuse river and its five tributaries represented a range of watershed characteristics i e watershed morphology and lulc si table 1 the sampling sites along the main stem of the neuse river at raleigh and clayton have greater proportions of urban lulc 27 and higher slope 7 but also very low proportions of wetlands 2 further downstream the main stem sites at kinston and ft barnwell has less urban lulc and shallower slopes 4 than upstream in the piedmont that coincided with greater wetland cover 10 and 13 respectively also notable agricultural lulc doubles in percentage from the more urbanized raleigh metropolitan region to the less urbanized region from kinston to ft barnwell the watersheds along the main stem of the neuse river also increases in size from raleigh 2809 m2 to ft barnwell 10 189 m2 the sub watersheds of tributaries to the neuse river also exemplify the gradient of lulc across the coastal river basin si table 1 si fig 1 for example middle creek s watershed in between raleigh and clayton is 65 urbanized and 1 wetland by contrast contentnea creek which enters the neuse river between kinston and ft barnwell had watershed characteristics of 10 urban and 44 agriculture and wetland cover was highest at 17 trent river a tributary to the upper part of the neuse river estuary had the lowest slope 1 with the lowest urbanization 4 and the highest wetland cover 32 the sub watershed area also ranged in size from piedmont stream little river 91 m2 and swift river 228 m2 to contentnea creek 1929 m2 and trent river 1044 m2 in the lower coastal plains 3 2 spatial variability in dissolved organic matter composition substantial spatial variation in dom composition was observed across sites within the neuse river basin fig 1 table 1 the upper neuse river basin sites raleigh and clayton had the lowest inter quantile range iqr for a245 doc and hix showing lower variability in these parameters at these sites whereas the middle kinston and lower neuse river sites trent contentnea and ft barnwell had higher median and larger iqr in particular the wetland dominated trent river sub watershed had roughly three fold higher median a254 doc and hix values than at the forested urban upper neuse river site near raleigh and clayton high iqr for a254 doc and hix were also observed for the tributary watersheds such as the smaller forested and urbanized swift creek and the largely agricultural contentnea creek and the lowest iqr was observed at upper neuse river sites at raleigh and clayton suva254 values also increased along the main stem of the neuse river the upper neuse river piedmont tributary sites e g middle and swift creek had values about twice greater than the upper neuse river main stem suva254 values similarly in the lower neuse river basin the tributary sites at contentnea creek and trent river had relatively greater suva254 values than the main river sites fig 1 analysis of variance anova and tukey s hsd multi comparison test also showed that the a254 suva254 hix and doc values in the upper neuse river sites specifically at raleigh was significantly different from the lower neuse river site at ft barnwell and the contentnea and trent river tributaries p 0 0001 table 1 in comparison bix values were relatively less variable at each sampling site fig 1 however the median bix values in forested and urbanized upper neuse river watershed near clayton and raleigh were nearly twice that of trent river bix values in middle neuse river sampling site at kinston were intermediate between the raleigh and trent river values fig 1 the anova and hsd analysis further underlined that the bix values at clayton and raleigh sites were significantly different from the trent river site p 0 0001 table 1 the s r values as an indicator of molecular weight showed minimal variability across study sites the iqr was greater at the forested and urban upper neuse river basin sites at clayton and raleigh the median s r values were significantly different than all other watersheds table 1 fig 1 also the median s r values were 1 for almost all the watersheds indicating an abundance of high molecular weight dom the forested and urbanized upper basin sites e g raleigh and clayton had a greater s r range upper ranges 1 low molecular weight dom compounds for all the dom variables the agricultural and urbanized smaller sub watersheds i e middle swift and little river were intermediate between the larger forested urban and agricultural and wetland dominated watersheds located in the middle and lower neuse river basin significant spatial variability across the basin was also observed for don fig 1 table 1 the median don values increased along the main stem of the neuse river and the highest median don and iqr values were observed at wetland dominated trent river and agriculturally dominated contentnea creek sites similarly doc don also increased from upper to lower neuse river with about two folds higher median doc don at trent river than the lowest values observed at clayton however the doc don was not significantly different between sampling sites per anova and hsd analysis p 0 05 table 1 we also tested the seasonal variability in dom compounds using anova and tukey s hsd multi comparison we did not find any significant differences in dom compounds with seasons except for a254 suva254 and doc however the terrestrial and aromatic dom and doc quantity were only significantly p 0 05 and about two times lower in winter than the rest of the seasons si table 3 3 3 factors explaining spatial variability in dom composition the rda analysis revealed that the explanatory variables explained 26 variability in dom composition and concentration p 0 001 rda axis 1 and 2 explained 21 and 2 variability in the dom concentration and composition data respectively rda axis 1 best represented the gradient of lulc with significant negative correlations with the vectors of wetland r 0 57 n 245 p 0 0001 and agriculture r 0 32 n 245 p 0 0001 and positive correlations with the vectors of forest r 0 43 n 245 p 0 0001 slope r 0 54 n 245 p 0 0001 and urban r 0 40 n 245 p 0 0001 lulc the vectors of urban forest and slope were also positively correlated to each other and negatively correlated to the vectors of wetland and agriculture fig 2 a b from these correlations it was evident that the slope and wetland exerted greater controls on the dom concentration and composition interestingly the watershed area did not exhibit any significant correlations with the rda axes watershed area was positively correlated with vectors of forest and slope p 0 0001 and negatively correlated with wetland p 0 001 and agriculture p 0 05 fig 2a b the rda tri plot also showed that high a254 doc suva254 and hix were observed in the tributary sites such as trent river and contentnea creek and lower neuse river sites at ft barnwell having appreciable wetland and agriculture coverage positive correlations were observed between a254 doc suva254 and hix p 0 0001 fig 2a b these four terrestrial dom indicators were also closely associated with the wetland and agriculture vectors p 0 0001 fig 2a b the higher values were represented by lower neuse river basin tributary sites at trent and contentnea sites followed by the lower neuse river main stem site at ft barnwell low values of a254 doc suva254 and hix were associated with upper neuse river main stem sites followed by relatively higher values at the tributary sites with prominent urban and forested lulc and high slope fig 2 b lulc also influenced the biological freshness of dom bix fig 2 a high bix values were observed in forested and urbanized streams with greater slopes while there was no relationship between bix and agricultural lulc fig 2a b thus hix was strongly anti correlated with bix p 0 0001 fig 2 b similarly the molecular weight of dom as assessed via s r was high in upper neuse river watersheds s r was also positively correlated with bix and negatively correlated with a254 doc and suva254 yet exhibited no relationship to lulc fig 2a b a multivariate model was developed to identify the adequate set of variables that explained the maximum variance in the dom concentration and composition data set we anticipated that the sub watershed level differences in dom concentration and composition were likely due to the differences in prominent lulc that characterized them redundancy analysis with variance partitioning showed that all variables except watershed area to have significant p 0 05 controls on the dom concentration and composition after correcting for autocorrelation and step wise variable selection with monte carlo permutation tests oksanen 2015 we identified wetland as the most significant variable that explained 16 variability in the dom concentration and composition stream slope was identified as the second most important variable although it explained only 2 of the variability in the dom concentration and composition finally a significant negative correlation between rda axis 1 and doc don was observed fig 2 c terrestrial dom typically has c n 12 autochthonous dom has c n 10 near the redfield ratio hedges et al 1986 redfield et al 1963 this trend was consistent with high negative loading for bix and high positive loadings for hix the trend indicated that the terrestrial contribution to dom was exemplified by axis 1 with more negative scores for dom having stronger wetland features no significant correlations were observed between these variables and rda axis 2 4 discussion 4 1 controls of lulc on dissolved organic matter concentration and composition results from this study confirmed our hypothesis that the dom concentration and composition would vary with watershed characteristics particularly regional lulc fig 2 our results indicated that wetland was the dominant lulc type for influencing dom concentration and composition percentage of wetland area has often found to be the most significant control on dom concentration and composition in other wetland dominated coastal systems mulholland et al 2003 osburn et al 2016a 2019 spencer et al 2013 a greater abundance of colored terrestrial humic aromatic dom and doc in wetland streams e g trent river is likely caused by the contribution of organic matter rich soils and litter leachates from riparian wetland forests williams et al 2010 yamashita et al 2010 the wetland soils may have also resulted in high don observed at the coastal tributary site osburn et al 2016b the wetland dominated streams had low bix and s r values that emphasized the reduced watershed influx of processed dom into the streams and perhaps also indicated that dom production and transformation via microbial or photo degradation was not a prominent process in these streams fellman et al 2010 williams et al 2010 in agricultural streams elevated agricultural runoff likely resulted in higher quantities of humic high molecular weight aromatic dom and doc agricultural watersheds due to high erosion rates or artificial drainage channels can aid the mobilization and transport of soil derived dom and doc to the streams graeber et al 2012 kaushal et al 2014 also dom transported from surface or subsurface layers either via tile drains or agricultural ditches under base flow conditions tend to be humic and high molecular weight in nature dalzell et al 2011 the agricultural streams were also abundant in don which is largely contributed by agricultural soils and effluents from cafos in the lower coastal plain streams in neuse river basin osburn et al 2016b higher terrestrial don contribution to streams as opposed to in stream don generation has also been observed in other watersheds e g hosen et al 2014 kaushal et al 2014 osburn et al 2016b pellerin et al 2006 reduced levels of in stream dom production and transformation in agricultural streams were further signified by the lack of positive correlations of agricultural lulc with bix and s r in comparison to the coastal agricultural and wetland streams the mixed forested and urban stream sites in the upper neuse river basin had the highest bix and s r values and lowest terrestrial dom doc and don values even though the terrestrial dom influx was lowest in the upper neuse river streams impervious surface runoff and septic wastewater were the likely contributors of don and dom to these streams osburn et al 2016a as such the dom and don derived from urban and agricultural watersheds tend to be more bioavailable to aquatic microbes pellerin et al 2006 hosen et al 2014 it is likely that the potentially bioavailable dom and don even in low quantities may have promoted in stream primary productivity and microbial activity resulting in the abundance of low molecular weight aliphatic dom in the urban and agricultural neuse river streams hounshell et al 2017 further a comparison of doc don across the main stem and sub watersheds of neuse river showed slightly greater values in wetland and agricultural streams than urban and forested streams the strong negative correlation of doc don with the rda axis 1 showed a higher contribution from terrestrial dom sources as opposed to in stream sources fig 2 c this observation is typical for c and n transport in the neuse river basin the don forms one of the larger components of total dissolved nitrogen in the neuse river basin lebo et al 2012 similar to doc don is also predominantly contributed by terrestrial sources and shows no significant relation with protein like dom produced autochthonously or transformed within streams osburn et al 2016b as such our observations were in contrast to other studies that have used doc don as an indicator of autochthonous production and microbial activity in some watersheds heinz et al 2015 our findings are important in light of the enormous spatial heterogeneity we found wherein the key driver to overcome this heterogeneity was the basin wide variability in lulc the shift from low molecular weight less complex and aliphatic dom to high molecular weight complex and aromatic dom along the main stem of the neuse river was a key aspect of spatial variability observed in our study similar headwater to downstream transition of dom composition and concentration has been observed in river systems ejarque et al 2017 spencer et al 2013 interestingly however the variability in dom composition and concentration in this coastal river basin was greater in the sub watersheds than the main stem sites which emphasizes the importance of heterogeneity in lulc on dom cycling even at small sub watershed scales coble et al 2019 our findings also show that unlike arctic river systems e g cory et al 2014 creed et al 2015 the longitudinal transition of dom composition observed in our study was not primarily driven by transformation and production of dom in the main stem the observed enrichment in high molecular weight aromatic dom from headwater to river mouth emphasizes that the spatial variability in dom is largely influenced by the location of prominent lulc in a large coastal river network finally seasonal changes can cause sizable temporal variability in dom composition and concentrations fellman et al 2009 jane et al 2017 however we did not observe any seasonal variability in dom composition and concentrations in our study this absence of seasonality is attributable to the lack of temporally resolved sampling across all sites as a consequence we may have missed capturing the seasonal variability at our sites more seasonally resolved sampling protocol may be required to successfully test the temporal variability in dom compounds 4 2 controls of watershed morphology on dissolved organic matter concentration and composition in addition to lulc we hypothesized that the watershed morphology expressed by the average slope and watershed area would exert a strong control on dom concentration and composition in neuse river basin the rda analysis showed that low gradient coastal plain watersheds with higher agriculture and wetland cover e g trent river and fort barnwell contributed greater quantities of humic aromatic and high molecular weight dom than the gradient watersheds located in upper neuse river basin fig 2 however variance partitioning showed that individually watershed characteristics explained a low amount of variability in dom dynamics and thus had a relatively lower contribution towards dom transport from watershed to stream than the dominant lulc watersheds with a low elevation gradient and larger watersheds tend to have longer residence times and flow paths that allow in stream dom generation by primary production and transformation by microbial or photodegradation graeber et al 2012 lambert et al 2015 in contrast watersheds with higher elevation gradients have shorter flow paths tend to be prone to erosion and contribute higher amounts of terrestrial humic dom marston 2010 raymond et al 2016 despite the expected effects of morphology the amount of terrestrial dom was highest in lower coastal plain tributaries and main river sites and lowest in higher gradient piedmont streams in the upper neuse river basin we speculate that the transport of terrestrial dom from watershed to streams was facilitated by a more pronounced river and landscape connectivity in the low gradient streams with extensive wetland and agricultural cover fig 2a b austnes et al 2010 stackpoole et al 2017 further it is possible that the upper neuse river watersheds might have longer residence times than expected due to the larger watershed area that transports low molecular weight dom however urban lulc might have an accompanying influence that allows in stream production of low molecular weight and less complex dom heinz et al 2015 williams et al 2010 we also found that agricultural watersheds tend to be a unique case as irrespective of lower watershed slope artificial drainage networks might reduce flow path lengths promote the transport of higher doc and humic dom to the streams heinz et al 2015 osburn et al 2012 royer and david 2005 and likely reduce en route microbial modifications unlike the observations reported by wilson and xenopoulos 2008 one aspect to be explored further is agricultural lulc in terms of silviculture these practices increase ditching and possible new hydrologic connectivity between nonriparian and riparian wetlands thereby increasing mobilization of wetland organic matter ensign and mallin 2001 osburn et al 2019 5 conclusion and implications our study revealed the complexity and spatial variability of synoptic observations over a large river basin with respect to dom properties as well as the dominant control of dom dynamics across sub watersheds through the use of dom optical indices a large basin scale understanding of dom concentration and composition helps to manage and predict ecosystem responses to future climatic and human stressors mccluney et al 2014 our study advances our understanding of basin scale variability in dom cycling in coastal river systems and links it to prominent lulc and watershed morphology we find that the physiographic transition of piedmont to coastal plain creates consistent changes in dom concentration and composition much of this is facilitated by the lower slope of the coastal plain allowing for wetland development and then a secondary effect is the agriculture lulc although in the piedmont urbanization tends to generate dom of a distinctive composition our results emphasized that higher transport of less complex and reactive dom molecules particularly from urban and agricultural watersheds presents a concern for coastal river and estuarine water quality and watershed management interests these threats are compounded by population expansion urbanization and agricultural intensification in the state of north carolina alone the average population has increased by 57 3 from 6 6 million in 1990 to 10 38 million in 2018 us census bureau 2019 also the percent of total population living in urban areas increased from 50 in 1990 to 66 in 2010 us census bureau 2019 thus it can be asserted that as lulc shifts from natural to more human dominated the dom concentration and composition is likely to become less complex and potentially bio available hosen et al 2014 parr et al 2015 increase in contribution of reactive dom and organic nitrogen can lead to negative ecological and socially relevant consequences such as increased microbial respiration greenhouse gas emissions anoxia fish kills and formation of toxic algal blooms in an already stressed coastal ecosystem further promoting loss of ecosystem services provided by these aquatic systems osburn et al 2016b paerl et al 2010 therefore our findings suggest that management strategies need to consider the basin wide differences in watershed characteristics to better manage coastal water resources traditionally routine monitoring efforts focus solely on dom quantity instead of concentration and composition our findings underline the need to focus on dom concentration and composition as it increases the understanding of the reactivity and source of carbon transfer from the landscape to coastal environments such information can be useful to predict how carbon cycling may change as lulc changes in the future also the utility of optical indices as a quick water quality assessment tool supplementary to large scale routine monitoring efforts is highlighted author contributions rb and

18350,the effect of watershed characteristics land use land cover and morphology on spatial variability in dissolved organic matter dom composition and concentrations of dissolved organic carbon doc and nitrogen don was assessed in a coastal river basin draining into pamlico sound in eastern north carolina usa understanding the factors that influence dom concentration and composition i e structurally complex molecules with high molecular weight versus low molecular weight simple molecules can provide insights on dom cycling and water composition implications such information is imperative for large coastal river networks undergoing rapid and intense land use and land cover lulc changes dom composition was estimated using optical indices calculated from dom absorbance and fluorescence measurements dom was derived from terrestrial sources and ordination analysis indicated that lulc in particular wetland area was the most significant control on dom composition and concentration wetland and agricultural coastal streams were abundant in humic and complex dom whereas forested and urban streams were least abundant in humic dom we speculate that greater availability of mobilizable dom in wetland and agricultural watersheds contributed to this observation in comparison mixed urbanized and forested streams in north carolina s piedmont region were abundant in doc less complex low molecular weight dom as well as greater amounts don due to higher urban runoff and elevated dom production in these streams our results indicated that physiographic transition from piedmont to coastal plain and varying lulc influenced the spatial variability in dom composition and concentration our findings highlight that increasing anthropogenic alterations might increase the abundance of reactive dom in coastal rivers and estuaries resulting in severe water quality issues this information is important for monitoring and developing land use policies graphical abstract

division of water quality 1 introduction dissolved organic matter dom is a major factor influencing the water quality and trophic status of aquatic ecosystems fellman et al 2010 spencer et al 2012 dissolved organic matter serves as an important nutrient source of dissolved organic carbon doc and dissolved organic nitrogen don dom is a fundamental limit on microbial respiration in aquatic ecosystems enhanced microbial respiration can lead to greenhouse gas emissions hypoxia and internal nutrient loading resulting in fish kills and formation of harmful algal blooms del giorgio and williams 2005 paerl et al 2006 dom may also limit primary productivity in aquatic environments by attenuating light and therefore influencing the overall carbon c cycling in aquatic ecosystems bernhardt and likens 2012 further dom can transport agricultural pollutants and heavy metals and leads to the formation of disinfection byproducts during drinking water treatment hudson et al 2007 kaushal et al 2014 factors such as prominent land use and watershed characteristics can substantially affect dom sources nadon et al 2015 osburn et al 2016a petrone et al 2011 williams et al 2010 in general dom in aquatic ecosystems is derived from two types of sources allochthonous and autochthonous allochthonous dom is terrestrially derived humic and aromatic in nature mobilized from the watershed to stream during precipitation runoff events raymond et al 2016 singh et al 2016 conversely autochthonous dom is mostly contributed by primary production by phytoplankton and submerged aquatic vegetation tzortziou et al 2010 yamashita and tanoue 2004 and also transformed by microbial and photochemical degradation cory et al 2018 depending on the source dom may also vary in terms of its composition for instance terrestrially derived dom is generally more recalcitrant structurally complex with high molecular weight and aromaticity whereas in stream produced or transformed dom may be a readily available simple molecule with low molecular weight and aromaticity fellman et al 2010 most previous studies of land use and land cover lulc drivers on dom composition have been conducted in small headwater streams where anthropogenic lulc has significant effects on dom source and composition fellman et al 2010 graeber et al 2012 in forested watersheds upper soil horizons and leaf debris tend to contribute low molecular weight reactive dom molecules to the streams singh et al 2012 in urban and agricultural watersheds impervious surfaces crop detritus and upper soils might contribute terrestrial humic slightly higher molecular weight yet reactive dom that can also promote in stream dom production and microbial processing hansen et al 2016 kaushal et al 2014 osburn et al 2016b royer and david 2005 conversely in wetlands organic matter rich soils and sub surface water pools contribute humic complex and recalcitrant terrestrial dom that may limit in stream productivity fellman et al 2010 yamashita et al 2010 a basin scale understanding of dom dynamics in coastal rivers that drain into ecologically significant estuaries is still needed to mitigate the influence of future anthropogenic and climatic perturbations on dom cycling coastal river networks are increasingly threatened by anthropogenic disturbances including agricultural intensification urbanization and population expansion martínez et al 2007 issues such as the formation of harmful algal blooms and fish kills are becoming more frequent and intense in the face of global climate and anthropogenic changes and significantly diminishing the ecological and economic services provided by coastal ecosystems barbier et al 2011 martínez et al 2007 paerl et al 2018 thus understanding the factors that influence dom cycling in large coastal river networks is critical to better manage these ecosystems and to forecast their responses to rapid and intense lulc changes the objective of this study was to utilize dom optical indices to examine the influences of watershed characteristics e g regional lulc watershed area and slope on spatial dom dynamics in the neuse river basin a coastal river network in eastern north carolina usa that drains into the pamlico sound the second largest estuarine complex in north america and its largest lagoonal complex both absorbance and fluorescence of dom were used as established approaches for assessing its source and composition in freshwaters fellman et al 2010 jaffé et al 2008 spencer et al 2013 we hypothesized that the dom source would vary with watershed characteristics influencing its concentration and composition along throughout the river network specifically we predicted that dom would increase in molecular complexity and molecular weight along the gradient of lulc urban agriculture forested wetland we also predicted that abundant wetlands in larger low elevation watersheds located within the lower coastal plain would result in more transport of complex terrestrial dom than the smaller higher elevation watersheds located in piedmont to upper coastal plain areas in neuse river basin each of which has lower abundance of wetlands 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the neuse river basin is the largest watershed 16 000 km2 in the state of north carolina usa the neuse river originates in northern piedmont at an altitude of 183 m and flows 320 km southeast through the upper and lower coastal plains to the pamlico sound at sea level christian et al 1991 supplementary information si fig 1 si table 1 us geological survey usgs gauges monitor discharge at several sites on the main stem of the river and on many of the river s tributaries fort barnwell usgs 02091814 is the last site in the neuse river basin prior to head of tide of the estuary the upper neuse river consists of several urban regions e g the raleigh durham metropolitan area while the lower neuse river watershed is largely comprised of agricultural areas with smaller urban areas national land cover data nldc 2011 north carolina division of water quality ncdwq 2009 confined animal feeding operations cafos are prevalent throughout the middle and lower portions of the neuse river basin ncdwq 2009 overall the neuse river and its estuary are affected by substantial loading of doc and bioavailable don from nonpoint sources including runoff from row crop agriculture silviculture and cafos as well as point sources such as discharges of treated wastewaters from municipal and industrial facilities e g lebo et al 2012 osburn et al 2016b stow et al 2001 thus the neuse river basin is an ideal setting for examining how physiography anthropogenic disturbances and watershed characteristics affect dom composition in a large coastal ecosystem 2 2 sampling and analyses water samples were collected approximately bi weekly from aug 2011 to april 2013 at the four sampling stations along the main stem of neuse river and at the outlet of its five tributaries approximately monthly by lower neuse river basin association lnba and north carolina division of water resources ncdwr si fig 1 samples were collected generally during base flow samples were stored at 4 c in dark conditions until they were analyzed at the biogeochemistry laboratory at n c state university the water samples were vacuum filtered typically on the day of collection using a pre combusted 450 c for 6 h 0 7 μm glass fiber filter whatman gf f to collect dom filtered samples were kept refrigerated and analyzed within 1 2 days of collection osburn et al 2016b a total of 245 samples were collected for this study and all of the water samples were analyzed for dom optical properties absorbance and fluorescence and doc a subset of the total samples mostly from the main stem of the neuse river and the two larger sub watersheds were analyzed for smaller subset don n 103 subsequently doc don ratios were only calculated for these four watersheds absorbance was measured in 1 cm quartz cells starna cells inc on a varian 300uv spectrophotometer against air laboratory water milli q 18 mω resistivity was used as a blank samples were diluted to achieve an optical density of 0 4 at 240 nm fluorescence was measured on a varian eclipse spectrophotometer also using milli q as a blank lamp intensity for fluorescence was either at 800 or 950 v depending on the sample response excitation ex wavelengths ranged from 240 to 450 nm at 5 nm intervals while emission em wavelengths were sampled at 2 nm intervals from 300 to 600 nm scans were made at the same dilution as absorbance the fluorescence measurements were then corrected for any subsequent inner filter effects tucker et al 1992 fluorescence was then calibrated against the instrument s water raman signal and standardized to quinine sulfate units ppb qsu where 1 qsu 1 μg l 1 quinine sulfate in 0 1 m h2so4 lawaetz and stedmon 2008 absorbance and fluorescence results were re scaled based on dilution factors as appropriate after the measurement of optical properties samples were acidified with 85 h3po4 and stored in the dark prior to doc analysis samples were pre sparged with ultrapure helium to remove inorganic carbon doc was measured using wet chemical oxidation in an oi analytical 1030 toc aurora toc analyzer osburn and st jean 2007 further don was calculated as the difference between total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn and sums ammonium and particulate nitrogen per standard methods 4500 norg apha 2005 for method details please see osburn et al 2016b and si table 2 2 3 dissolved organic matter composition the dom composition was explored using several optical indices the napierian absorption coefficient at 254 nm a254 was chosen to quantify the colored dom content cdom specific uv absorption at 254 nm suva25 a measure of dom aromaticity was calculated as the ratio between absorbance at 254 nm and doc concentration a254 doc weishaar et al 2003 spectral slopes s for the intervals 275 295 and 350 400 nm s 275 295 and s 350 400 were determined from the linear regression of the log transformed absorption spectra versus wavelength the slope ratio s r was calculated as the ratio of s 275 295 to s 350 400 and is used as an indicator of the molecular weight distribution of dom with values less than 1 indicative of enrichment in higher molecular weight compounds and values above 1 indicative of a higher degree of low molecular weight compounds helms et al 2008 we also calculated the index of the relative degree of humification hix and the index of recent biological productivity contribution bix zsolnay et al 1999 huguet et al 2009 hix is the ratio of fluorescence emitted at 435 480 nm to that emitted at 300 345 nm at excitation 254 nm high fluorescence hix values correspond to high fluorescence emission at longer wavelengths indicating larger contributions from complex molecules and high mw aromatics huguet et al 2009 specifically hix values ranging from 1 to 2 are associated with non humified material and values 10 are typical for fulvic acid extracts zsolnay et al 1999 bix is calculated as the fluorescence emitted at 380 nm divided by the fluorescence emitted at 430 nm at 310 nm excitation tzortziou et al 2015 both doc and don can have multiple sources degradability and bio availability which influences their transport from the watershed to the stream hence the ratio between doc and don has been used as an indicator of organic matter source and processing fellman et al 2010 lee et al 2018 in this study we used doc don ratios as an indicator for terrestrial dom input from the watersheds to the streams perdue and koprivnjak 2007 2 4 watershed characteristics analysis arcgis spatial analysis toolbox was used to estimate the watershed characteristics e g morphology and land use and land cover from the national hydrography dataset nhdlusv1 2003 land use and land cover lulc were estimated from the nlcd 2011 the nlcd 2011 was reclassified into four main groups forest agriculture urban and wetland for simplicity si fig 1 while consolidating the lulc groups no watershed lulc types were excluded except open water which constituted 1 area in each watershed the of lulc were calculated for each sub watershed and the entire basin see bhattacharya and osburn 2017 for details see si table 1 we selected nine sub watersheds including the main stem of the neuse river and its five tributaries to represent a gradient of lulc and morphology si fig 1 si table 1 2 5 statistical analyses the distribution of dom optical indices as a measure of dom composition were checked by q q plots and histograms parameters were centered scaled and log transformed log10 n 10 to achieve a normal distribution linear regressions were conducted for outlier identification plots of standardized residuals vs leverage hat value with an influence measure cook s distance were used to identify the outliers observations with cook s distance three times greater than the mean were removed prior to the regression based analyses to ensure normal distribution of data cook and weisberg 1982 dom composition was tested with respect to watershed variability and seasonal variability using one dimensional analysis of variance anova and tukey s honest significance difference hsd a single step multiple comparison statistical test the relation between optical indices and explanatory variables i e lulc watershed area and slope were determined by redundancy analysis rda to identify a minimum subset of significant variables that can explain variations in the optical properties first we assessed the multicollinearity in the data using variance inflation factor vif in which variables with vif greater than 10 were removed second a parsimonious model was selected through step wise regression with monte carlo permutation tests ter braak and smilauer 2002 we then conducted variance partitioning to explore the percent variance uniquely explained by each variable further the rda axes scores were compared to the doc don ratios to explore if the c and nitrogen n bearing dom varied with the dom composition and explanatory variables the rda was conducted using vegan 2 3 1 package in the r statistical software environment 3 results 3 1 characteristics of the neuse river basin and its sub watersheds the sub watersheds in the neuse river basin are variable and mixed in terms of the prominent lulc si fig 1 the nine sub watersheds including the main stem of neuse river and its five tributaries represented a range of watershed characteristics i e watershed morphology and lulc si table 1 the sampling sites along the main stem of the neuse river at raleigh and clayton have greater proportions of urban lulc 27 and higher slope 7 but also very low proportions of wetlands 2 further downstream the main stem sites at kinston and ft barnwell has less urban lulc and shallower slopes 4 than upstream in the piedmont that coincided with greater wetland cover 10 and 13 respectively also notable agricultural lulc doubles in percentage from the more urbanized raleigh metropolitan region to the less urbanized region from kinston to ft barnwell the watersheds along the main stem of the neuse river also increases in size from raleigh 2809 m2 to ft barnwell 10 189 m2 the sub watersheds of tributaries to the neuse river also exemplify the gradient of lulc across the coastal river basin si table 1 si fig 1 for example middle creek s watershed in between raleigh and clayton is 65 urbanized and 1 wetland by contrast contentnea creek which enters the neuse river between kinston and ft barnwell had watershed characteristics of 10 urban and 44 agriculture and wetland cover was highest at 17 trent river a tributary to the upper part of the neuse river estuary had the lowest slope 1 with the lowest urbanization 4 and the highest wetland cover 32 the sub watershed area also ranged in size from piedmont stream little river 91 m2 and swift river 228 m2 to contentnea creek 1929 m2 and trent river 1044 m2 in the lower coastal plains 3 2 spatial variability in dissolved organic matter composition substantial spatial variation in dom composition was observed across sites within the neuse river basin fig 1 table 1 the upper neuse river basin sites raleigh and clayton had the lowest inter quantile range iqr for a245 doc and hix showing lower variability in these parameters at these sites whereas the middle kinston and lower neuse river sites trent contentnea and ft barnwell had higher median and larger iqr in particular the wetland dominated trent river sub watershed had roughly three fold higher median a254 doc and hix values than at the forested urban upper neuse river site near raleigh and clayton high iqr for a254 doc and hix were also observed for the tributary watersheds such as the smaller forested and urbanized swift creek and the largely agricultural contentnea creek and the lowest iqr was observed at upper neuse river sites at raleigh and clayton suva254 values also increased along the main stem of the neuse river the upper neuse river piedmont tributary sites e g middle and swift creek had values about twice greater than the upper neuse river main stem suva254 values similarly in the lower neuse river basin the tributary sites at contentnea creek and trent river had relatively greater suva254 values than the main river sites fig 1 analysis of variance anova and tukey s hsd multi comparison test also showed that the a254 suva254 hix and doc values in the upper neuse river sites specifically at raleigh was significantly different from the lower neuse river site at ft barnwell and the contentnea and trent river tributaries p 0 0001 table 1 in comparison bix values were relatively less variable at each sampling site fig 1 however the median bix values in forested and urbanized upper neuse river watershed near clayton and raleigh were nearly twice that of trent river bix values in middle neuse river sampling site at kinston were intermediate between the raleigh and trent river values fig 1 the anova and hsd analysis further underlined that the bix values at clayton and raleigh sites were significantly different from the trent river site p 0 0001 table 1 the s r values as an indicator of molecular weight showed minimal variability across study sites the iqr was greater at the forested and urban upper neuse river basin sites at clayton and raleigh the median s r values were significantly different than all other watersheds table 1 fig 1 also the median s r values were 1 for almost all the watersheds indicating an abundance of high molecular weight dom the forested and urbanized upper basin sites e g raleigh and clayton had a greater s r range upper ranges 1 low molecular weight dom compounds for all the dom variables the agricultural and urbanized smaller sub watersheds i e middle swift and little river were intermediate between the larger forested urban and agricultural and wetland dominated watersheds located in the middle and lower neuse river basin significant spatial variability across the basin was also observed for don fig 1 table 1 the median don values increased along the main stem of the neuse river and the highest median don and iqr values were observed at wetland dominated trent river and agriculturally dominated contentnea creek sites similarly doc don also increased from upper to lower neuse river with about two folds higher median doc don at trent river than the lowest values observed at clayton however the doc don was not significantly different between sampling sites per anova and hsd analysis p 0 05 table 1 we also tested the seasonal variability in dom compounds using anova and tukey s hsd multi comparison we did not find any significant differences in dom compounds with seasons except for a254 suva254 and doc however the terrestrial and aromatic dom and doc quantity were only significantly p 0 05 and about two times lower in winter than the rest of the seasons si table 3 3 3 factors explaining spatial variability in dom composition the rda analysis revealed that the explanatory variables explained 26 variability in dom composition and concentration p 0 001 rda axis 1 and 2 explained 21 and 2 variability in the dom concentration and composition data respectively rda axis 1 best represented the gradient of lulc with significant negative correlations with the vectors of wetland r 0 57 n 245 p 0 0001 and agriculture r 0 32 n 245 p 0 0001 and positive correlations with the vectors of forest r 0 43 n 245 p 0 0001 slope r 0 54 n 245 p 0 0001 and urban r 0 40 n 245 p 0 0001 lulc the vectors of urban forest and slope were also positively correlated to each other and negatively correlated to the vectors of wetland and agriculture fig 2 a b from these correlations it was evident that the slope and wetland exerted greater controls on the dom concentration and composition interestingly the watershed area did not exhibit any significant correlations with the rda axes watershed area was positively correlated with vectors of forest and slope p 0 0001 and negatively correlated with wetland p 0 001 and agriculture p 0 05 fig 2a b the rda tri plot also showed that high a254 doc suva254 and hix were observed in the tributary sites such as trent river and contentnea creek and lower neuse river sites at ft barnwell having appreciable wetland and agriculture coverage positive correlations were observed between a254 doc suva254 and hix p 0 0001 fig 2a b these four terrestrial dom indicators were also closely associated with the wetland and agriculture vectors p 0 0001 fig 2a b the higher values were represented by lower neuse river basin tributary sites at trent and contentnea sites followed by the lower neuse river main stem site at ft barnwell low values of a254 doc suva254 and hix were associated with upper neuse river main stem sites followed by relatively higher values at the tributary sites with prominent urban and forested lulc and high slope fig 2 b lulc also influenced the biological freshness of dom bix fig 2 a high bix values were observed in forested and urbanized streams with greater slopes while there was no relationship between bix and agricultural lulc fig 2a b thus hix was strongly anti correlated with bix p 0 0001 fig 2 b similarly the molecular weight of dom as assessed via s r was high in upper neuse river watersheds s r was also positively correlated with bix and negatively correlated with a254 doc and suva254 yet exhibited no relationship to lulc fig 2a b a multivariate model was developed to identify the adequate set of variables that explained the maximum variance in the dom concentration and composition data set we anticipated that the sub watershed level differences in dom concentration and composition were likely due to the differences in prominent lulc that characterized them redundancy analysis with variance partitioning showed that all variables except watershed area to have significant p 0 05 controls on the dom concentration and composition after correcting for autocorrelation and step wise variable selection with monte carlo permutation tests oksanen 2015 we identified wetland as the most significant variable that explained 16 variability in the dom concentration and composition stream slope was identified as the second most important variable although it explained only 2 of the variability in the dom concentration and composition finally a significant negative correlation between rda axis 1 and doc don was observed fig 2 c terrestrial dom typically has c n 12 autochthonous dom has c n 10 near the redfield ratio hedges et al 1986 redfield et al 1963 this trend was consistent with high negative loading for bix and high positive loadings for hix the trend indicated that the terrestrial contribution to dom was exemplified by axis 1 with more negative scores for dom having stronger wetland features no significant correlations were observed between these variables and rda axis 2 4 discussion 4 1 controls of lulc on dissolved organic matter concentration and composition results from this study confirmed our hypothesis that the dom concentration and composition would vary with watershed characteristics particularly regional lulc fig 2 our results indicated that wetland was the dominant lulc type for influencing dom concentration and composition percentage of wetland area has often found to be the most significant control on dom concentration and composition in other wetland dominated coastal systems mulholland et al 2003 osburn et al 2016a 2019 spencer et al 2013 a greater abundance of colored terrestrial humic aromatic dom and doc in wetland streams e g trent river is likely caused by the contribution of organic matter rich soils and litter leachates from riparian wetland forests williams et al 2010 yamashita et al 2010 the wetland soils may have also resulted in high don observed at the coastal tributary site osburn et al 2016b the wetland dominated streams had low bix and s r values that emphasized the reduced watershed influx of processed dom into the streams and perhaps also indicated that dom production and transformation via microbial or photo degradation was not a prominent process in these streams fellman et al 2010 williams et al 2010 in agricultural streams elevated agricultural runoff likely resulted in higher quantities of humic high molecular weight aromatic dom and doc agricultural watersheds due to high erosion rates or artificial drainage channels can aid the mobilization and transport of soil derived dom and doc to the streams graeber et al 2012 kaushal et al 2014 also dom transported from surface or subsurface layers either via tile drains or agricultural ditches under base flow conditions tend to be humic and high molecular weight in nature dalzell et al 2011 the agricultural streams were also abundant in don which is largely contributed by agricultural soils and effluents from cafos in the lower coastal plain streams in neuse river basin osburn et al 2016b higher terrestrial don contribution to streams as opposed to in stream don generation has also been observed in other watersheds e g hosen et al 2014 kaushal et al 2014 osburn et al 2016b pellerin et al 2006 reduced levels of in stream dom production and transformation in agricultural streams were further signified by the lack of positive correlations of agricultural lulc with bix and s r in comparison to the coastal agricultural and wetland streams the mixed forested and urban stream sites in the upper neuse river basin had the highest bix and s r values and lowest terrestrial dom doc and don values even though the terrestrial dom influx was lowest in the upper neuse river streams impervious surface runoff and septic wastewater were the likely contributors of don and dom to these streams osburn et al 2016a as such the dom and don derived from urban and agricultural watersheds tend to be more bioavailable to aquatic microbes pellerin et al 2006 hosen et al 2014 it is likely that the potentially bioavailable dom and don even in low quantities may have promoted in stream primary productivity and microbial activity resulting in the abundance of low molecular weight aliphatic dom in the urban and agricultural neuse river streams hounshell et al 2017 further a comparison of doc don across the main stem and sub watersheds of neuse river showed slightly greater values in wetland and agricultural streams than urban and forested streams the strong negative correlation of doc don with the rda axis 1 showed a higher contribution from terrestrial dom sources as opposed to in stream sources fig 2 c this observation is typical for c and n transport in the neuse river basin the don forms one of the larger components of total dissolved nitrogen in the neuse river basin lebo et al 2012 similar to doc don is also predominantly contributed by terrestrial sources and shows no significant relation with protein like dom produced autochthonously or transformed within streams osburn et al 2016b as such our observations were in contrast to other studies that have used doc don as an indicator of autochthonous production and microbial activity in some watersheds heinz et al 2015 our findings are important in light of the enormous spatial heterogeneity we found wherein the key driver to overcome this heterogeneity was the basin wide variability in lulc the shift from low molecular weight less complex and aliphatic dom to high molecular weight complex and aromatic dom along the main stem of the neuse river was a key aspect of spatial variability observed in our study similar headwater to downstream transition of dom composition and concentration has been observed in river systems ejarque et al 2017 spencer et al 2013 interestingly however the variability in dom composition and concentration in this coastal river basin was greater in the sub watersheds than the main stem sites which emphasizes the importance of heterogeneity in lulc on dom cycling even at small sub watershed scales coble et al 2019 our findings also show that unlike arctic river systems e g cory et al 2014 creed et al 2015 the longitudinal transition of dom composition observed in our study was not primarily driven by transformation and production of dom in the main stem the observed enrichment in high molecular weight aromatic dom from headwater to river mouth emphasizes that the spatial variability in dom is largely influenced by the location of prominent lulc in a large coastal river network finally seasonal changes can cause sizable temporal variability in dom composition and concentrations fellman et al 2009 jane et al 2017 however we did not observe any seasonal variability in dom composition and concentrations in our study this absence of seasonality is attributable to the lack of temporally resolved sampling across all sites as a consequence we may have missed capturing the seasonal variability at our sites more seasonally resolved sampling protocol may be required to successfully test the temporal variability in dom compounds 4 2 controls of watershed morphology on dissolved organic matter concentration and composition in addition to lulc we hypothesized that the watershed morphology expressed by the average slope and watershed area would exert a strong control on dom concentration and composition in neuse river basin the rda analysis showed that low gradient coastal plain watersheds with higher agriculture and wetland cover e g trent river and fort barnwell contributed greater quantities of humic aromatic and high molecular weight dom than the gradient watersheds located in upper neuse river basin fig 2 however variance partitioning showed that individually watershed characteristics explained a low amount of variability in dom dynamics and thus had a relatively lower contribution towards dom transport from watershed to stream than the dominant lulc watersheds with a low elevation gradient and larger watersheds tend to have longer residence times and flow paths that allow in stream dom generation by primary production and transformation by microbial or photodegradation graeber et al 2012 lambert et al 2015 in contrast watersheds with higher elevation gradients have shorter flow paths tend to be prone to erosion and contribute higher amounts of terrestrial humic dom marston 2010 raymond et al 2016 despite the expected effects of morphology the amount of terrestrial dom was highest in lower coastal plain tributaries and main river sites and lowest in higher gradient piedmont streams in the upper neuse river basin we speculate that the transport of terrestrial dom from watershed to streams was facilitated by a more pronounced river and landscape connectivity in the low gradient streams with extensive wetland and agricultural cover fig 2a b austnes et al 2010 stackpoole et al 2017 further it is possible that the upper neuse river watersheds might have longer residence times than expected due to the larger watershed area that transports low molecular weight dom however urban lulc might have an accompanying influence that allows in stream production of low molecular weight and less complex dom heinz et al 2015 williams et al 2010 we also found that agricultural watersheds tend to be a unique case as irrespective of lower watershed slope artificial drainage networks might reduce flow path lengths promote the transport of higher doc and humic dom to the streams heinz et al 2015 osburn et al 2012 royer and david 2005 and likely reduce en route microbial modifications unlike the observations reported by wilson and xenopoulos 2008 one aspect to be explored further is agricultural lulc in terms of silviculture these practices increase ditching and possible new hydrologic connectivity between nonriparian and riparian wetlands thereby increasing mobilization of wetland organic matter ensign and mallin 2001 osburn et al 2019 5 conclusion and implications our study revealed the complexity and spatial variability of synoptic observations over a large river basin with respect to dom properties as well as the dominant control of dom dynamics across sub watersheds through the use of dom optical indices a large basin scale understanding of dom concentration and composition helps to manage and predict ecosystem responses to future climatic and human stressors mccluney et al 2014 our study advances our understanding of basin scale variability in dom cycling in coastal river systems and links it to prominent lulc and watershed morphology we find that the physiographic transition of piedmont to coastal plain creates consistent changes in dom concentration and composition much of this is facilitated by the lower slope of the coastal plain allowing for wetland development and then a secondary effect is the agriculture lulc although in the piedmont urbanization tends to generate dom of a distinctive composition our results emphasized that higher transport of less complex and reactive dom molecules particularly from urban and agricultural watersheds presents a concern for coastal river and estuarine water quality and watershed management interests these threats are compounded by population expansion urbanization and agricultural intensification in the state of north carolina alone the average population has increased by 57 3 from 6 6 million in 1990 to 10 38 million in 2018 us census bureau 2019 also the percent of total population living in urban areas increased from 50 in 1990 to 66 in 2010 us census bureau 2019 thus it can be asserted that as lulc shifts from natural to more human dominated the dom concentration and composition is likely to become less complex and potentially bio available hosen et al 2014 parr et al 2015 increase in contribution of reactive dom and organic nitrogen can lead to negative ecological and socially relevant consequences such as increased microbial respiration greenhouse gas emissions anoxia fish kills and formation of toxic algal blooms in an already stressed coastal ecosystem further promoting loss of ecosystem services provided by these aquatic systems osburn et al 2016b paerl et al 2010 therefore our findings suggest that management strategies need to consider the basin wide differences in watershed characteristics to better manage coastal water resources traditionally routine monitoring efforts focus solely on dom quantity instead of concentration and composition our findings underline the need to focus on dom concentration and composition as it increases the understanding of the reactivity and source of carbon transfer from the landscape to coastal environments such information can be useful to predict how carbon cycling may change as lulc changes in the future also the utility of optical indices as a quick water quality assessment tool supplementary to large scale routine monitoring efforts is highlighted author contributions rb and

18351,bio denitrification i e microbial reduction of nitrate to gaseous nitrogen is usually reported to be affected by operating and environmental parameters such as carbon source type ph value and temperature in this paper the enhancement of denitrification performance with the elimination of nitrite accumulation and nitrous oxide emission by shewanella oneidensis mr 1 were investigated and the mechanisms were explored it was found that s oneidensis mr 1 itself had marginal nitrate removal capacity but its presence in the denitrification system of a well studied denitrifier paracoccus denitrificans obviously enhanced nitrate removal efficiency from 65 3 to 97 8 and reduced nitrite accumulation 0 67 against none detectable and n2o generation from 8 87 μm mm tn to none detectable the mechanism study showed that s oneidensis mr 1 promoted electrons transfer activity via the formation of nanotube between cells which resulted in the increase of denitrification enzymes activity carbon source metabolism atp level and cell viability as the generation transfer and consumption of electrons were enhanced by s oneidensis mr 1 the improvement of denitrification performance with reduction of nitrite accumulation and n2o emission was therefore achieved finally the performance of denitrification enhanced by s oneidensis mr 1 was testified by laboratory groundwater treatment experiment this study suggested the potential role of s oneidensis mr 1 in accelerating nitrate bio transformation in nitrogen geochemical cycle and increasing bio treatment of nitrate contamination with negligible harmful intermediates nitrite and n2o accumulation graphical abstract image 1 keywords denitrification shewanella oneidensis mr 1 nitrite n2o nadh electrons 1 introduction the beginning of the 21st century has witnessed continued inputs of reactive nitrogen to the biosphere by anthropogenic activities and the aggregation of nitrogen by the end of this century will be 600 tg n yr 1 particularly through combustion emissions nitrogen fertilizers usage and biological and agricultural nitrogen fixation burow et al 2010 fowler et al 2015 it was reported that global nitrogen cycle would subject to collapse if excrescent nitrogen lost its way into atmosphere as nitrogen gas dalsgaard et al 2003 nitrate is particularly mobile through both water and soil and excess nitrate from sewage agricultural fertilizers or intensive farming easily makes its direction into underground aquifers and surface waters it is a necessary nutrient but its excessive input in aquatic ecosystem can cause environmental pollution and security problem which has been widely concerned by researchers ballantine et al 2014 bio denitrification plays an important role in the cycle of biosphere nitrogen microbial denitrification has the advantages of convenient operation and small secondary pollution which has been extensively applied to reduce or remove nitrate from the contaminated environments such as groundwater it has been reported that biological nitrate removal is affected by the environmental and operating parameters such as carbon source ph value and temperature lu et al 2014 to biological denitrification of municipal wastewater and groundwater the biggest challenge is the low denitrification efficiency caused by low bioavailability of carbon even if the organic matter contained in the water is hydrolyzed it is difficult to achieve the carbon to nitrogen ratio bod5 tkn 5 required for biological nitrogen removal gu and onnis hayden 2010 huno et al 2018 rivett et al 2008 also toxic nitrous oxide n2o can easily generate in biological denitrification process itokawa et al 2001 thus many efforts have been tried to increase the biotransformation of nitrate for example by the supplement of external carbon sources such as methanol ethanol or acetate the denitrification performance can be remarkably enhanced salminen et al 2014 smith et al 2001 nevertheless it increases process costs and inaccurate dosing of carbon sources can cause secondary pollution ballantine et al 2014 biological denitrification requires the participation of electrons to consecutively reduce nitrate to nitrite nitric oxide nitrous oxide and finally nitrogen gas to achieve this heterotrophic denitrifiers metabolize carbon source to produce the direct electron donor nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nadh which is then transferred via electron transport system i e nadh dehydrogenase complex i the quinone pool bc1 complex complex iii and cytochrome c to corresponding denitrification reductases berks et al 1995 thus increasing electrons generation transport and consumption will promote the sequential biochemical reactions involved in denitrification process until now however the study on the use of non chemical method to simultaneously increase electrons generation transport and consumption to enhance denitrification performance with reduction of nitrite accumulation and n2o emission in microbial denitrification process has never been documented shewanella oneidensis was reported in various niches such as lake oneida dark sea hot spring and the columbia river ghosh et al 2003 turse et al 2010 venkateswaran et al 1999 and has been frequently studied as a promising microbe in environmental bioremediation min et al 2017 szczuka et al 2015 in this paper the enhancement of denitrification performance with the reduction of nitrite accumulation and n2o emission by shewanella oneidensis mr 1 was investigated and the mechanism was explored further firstly the denitrification performance of a frequently used denitrifier paracoccus denitrificans in the presence and absence of s oneidensis mr 1 was compared as the addition of s oneidensis mr 1 enhanced the performance of denitrification and solo cultured s oneidensis mr 1 showed marginal nitrate removal the mechanism of s oneidensis mr 1 in denitrification system was then explored by the investigations of carbon source metabolism nadh production electron transport and enzymatic activity involved in denitrification finally the feasibility of using s oneidensis mr 1 to enhance denitrification performance was evaluated in a laboratory groundwater bio treatment system for future practical application 2 materials and methods 2 1 source of microbes p denitrificans atcc 19367 a widely used denitrifying bacterium in the literature fig s1 supporting information was adopted as a model denitrifying microbe in this study s oneidensis mr 1 atcc 700550 and p denitrificans atcc 19367 were stored at 80 c prior to use they were routinely cultured in lb luria bertani broth aerobically with bath shaker 150 rpm at 30 c until the late logarithmic growth phase then cells were harvested by centrifugation 4500 rpm for 5 min washed twice with 0 1 m pbs ph 7 4 and re suspended in pbs before use ground soil was withdrawn from a depth of 2 m below the earth s surface in the campus of tongij university 1239 siping road shanghai 200092 china it was sealed in a pe hermetic bag and transported to the laboratory immediately after being sieved through 2 mm mesh and homogenized the soil was then used as the seed for groundwater denitrification experiments 2 2 medium of denitrification in the denitrification experiments of model denitrifier the basic medium was a modified version of that used as our previously described which contained 21 36 mm kno3 10 66 mm nh4cl 17 93 mm kh2po4 32 76 mm na2hpo4 0 41 mm mgso4 7h2o 5 ml trace metals and 10 ml vitamin solution cruz garcia et al 2007 wan et al 2016 an amount of 43 17 mm ch3coona was added for biomass growth and nitrate reduction according to our previously result as acetate was not the preferred carbon source for s oneidensis mr 1 a small amount of l lactate 3 00 mm was supplemented by default into bottles where this strain was seeded unless special instructions gao et al 2009 the initial medium ph was adjusted to 7 2 with 2 0 m hcl and 2 0 m naoh anaerobic condition was achieved by extensively purging the medium with o2 free n2 15 min into 160 ml glass serum bottles which were then sealed with black butyl stoppers and autoclaved at 121 c 0 12 mpa for 15 min to prevent precipitate formation mgso4 7h2o trace metals and vitamins were autoclaved 200 fold stock solutions separately and then added to the serum bottles by syringe the total volume of the medium was 100 ml in the groundwater denitrification experiments the main ions reported by the latest shanghai geological environmental bulletin http www shgtj gov cn dzkc dzhjbg 201412 t20141215 642773 html were prepared according to their average concentrations measured in groundwater sampling points table s1 supporting information namely 1 55 mm nacl 1 75 mm mgcl2 6h2o 2 38 mm ca hco3 2 2 60 mm nahco3 0 02 mm nh4cl 0 51 mm no3 n and 0 009 mm kno2 as the concentration of no3 n in real groundwater also varied and in order to maintain a stable initial nitrate kno3 was added to reach a final concentration of 3 50 mm no3 n in all tests to monitor a higher nitrate contamination in groundwater according to previous reports wang et al 2009 10 00 mm ch3coona and 1 00 mm l lactate were added as the carbon sources for groundwater denitrification experiments 2 3 experiments of the performance of model denitrifier affected by s oneidensis mr 1 prior to the experiments the amount of s oneidensis mr 1 added to the denitrification system of model denitrifier was determined by investigating the influence of different inoculated ratios of od600 of p denitrificans to s oneidensis mr 1 i e p s on the removal efficiency of nitrate in the reactors the od600 of inoculated p denitrificans was maintained at 0 02 but that of s oneidensis mr 1 was changed according to the studied ratio of p s it was found that the nitrate removal efficiency was increased with the increase of s oneidensis mr 1 addition fig s2 supporting information in this study only one ratio of p s i e 1 5 was taken as an example to investigate the performance and mechanisms of model denitrifier affected by s oneidensis mr 1 in the following text the experiment procedure was conducted as follows nine anaerobic bottles were used and 100 ml of denitrification medium was added to each one these bottles were divided equally into three groups m 1 m 2 and m 3 see table 1 p denitrificans was inoculated to the bottles of m 1 and m 2 with an od600 of 0 02 in each bottle and s oneidensis mr 1 was seeded to each bottle in m 2 and m 3 with an od600 of 0 10 then 0 1 m pbs was used to adjust the total volume of liquid medium in each one to 110 ml all bottles were maintained in an air bath shaker 150 rpm at 30 1 c samples were withdrawn by syringe at different time and were filtered through 0 22 μm membrane filters before wet analyses being conducted 2 4 batch tests of lactate and s oneidensis mr 1 affecting acetate utilization by p denitrificans in the current study there were two different microbes i e p denitrificans and s oneidensis mr 1 and acetate and lactate were their carbon sources respectively although the amount of lactate was much lower than that of acetate and the sole culture of s oneidensis mr 1 itself contributed marginally to denitrification their presence on acetate utilization by p denitrificans need to be investigated also the presence of acetate and p denitrificans on the utilization of lactate by s oneidensis mr 1 was studied the batch tests were conducted in fifteen anaerobic bottles which were divided equally into five groups c 1 c 2 c 3 c 4 and c 5 and the details were the same as those described in section 2 3 except for the carbon source and inoculator see table 1 2 5 experiments of groundwater denitrification affected by s oneidensis mr 1 six anaerobic bottles were used and 300 ml synthetic groundwater was added to each one these bottles were divided equally into two groups i e r 1 and r 2 and r 1 without s oneidensis mr 1 supplement was served as the control s oneidensis mr 1 was supplemented to each bottle in r 2 with a final od600 of 0 2 in order to simulate the actual groundwater environment ground soil was seeded to both r 1 and r 2 see table 1 with concentration of 5 0 g l each after being flushed with n2 for 15 min to remove oxygen all bottles were capped with rubber stoppers sealed and placed in an air bath shaker 80 rpm at 30 1 c samples were withdrawn at different time and liquid samples were then filtered through 0 22 μm membrane filters before analyses 2 6 assays of complex i complex iii and electron transport system activity etsa to prepare crude cell extracts for complex i and complex iii assays cells after the experiment were harvested washed twice with 0 1 m pbs ph 7 4 and re suspended in pbs the crude was then obtained by sonication 20 khz 5min 4 c and centrifugation 10 min 14000 g 4 c the activity of complex i was estimated by measuring the decrease of nadh at 340 nm the reaction mixture 1 ml contained 100 μm nadh 50 μm ubiquinone aladdin china and 300 μl of cell extract humphries and szweda 1998 besides 5 μm azoxystrobin aladdin china was added to eliminate nadh consumption by complex iii esser et al 2004 the activity of complex iii was determined by monitoring the reduction of cytochrome c at 550 nm the reaction mixture 1 ml contained 0 5 mm edta 50 μm oxidized cytochrome c 40 μm of ubiquinol 2 and 300 μl of cell extract veitch et al 1992 the ubiquinol 2 was obtained by reducing 8 mm ubiquinone 2 dissolved in ethanoic solution by solid borohydride acidification with hci and subsequent extraction in cyclohexane the etsa was determined by reducing 2 p iodophenyl 3 p nitrophenyl 5 phenyl tetrazolium chloride int a kind of exogenous electron acceptor to formazan hu et al 2018 according to the literature broberg 1985 cells were washed twice with 0 05 m pbs ph 7 4 200 μl of int 0 5 and 0 2 mg nadh were added into 1 ml of the above resuspended bacteria and 100 μl of formaldehyde was added to stop the reaction after dark incubation at 30 c for 30 min inf in the centrifuged bacteria was extract twice with 500 μl of 96 methanol and the inf extract was measured at 490 nm the etsa was finally calculated by transforming of μm int formazan to μg o2 2 7 high resolution scanning electron microscopy hr sem analysis the bacterial morphology was analyzed by hr sem image after a succession of treatment steps according to the literature dubey and ben yehuda 2011 briefly cells after above experiment were dropped on the carbon film surface of a copper grid 200 mesh from beijing zhongjingkeyi technology co ltd and then set still for 30 min to facilitate the attachment of cell on it this procedure was conducted in an anaerobic glove box 20 co2 80 n2 after that cells on grid were gently washed with 0 1 m sodium cacodylate buffer na ch3 2aso2 3h2o ph 7 2 and then fixed with 2 0 glutaraldehyde in sodium cacodylate buffer 0 1 m ph 7 2 at 25 c for 2 h next cells were post fixed by incubation with 1 osmium tetroxide at 25 c in the dark for 1 h and then dehydrated by exposure to a graded series of ethanol washes 25 50 75 95 and 100 10 min each finally the grid attached cells were washed with a graded series of freon 113 25 50 75 95 and 100 freon in ethanol 10 min each specimens were coated with gold by quorum technologies sc7640 sputter coater and cells were observed using zeiss supra 55 scanning electron microscope 2 8 other analytical methods the protein concentration of cell extracts was measured using protein assay kit bio rad with bovine serum albumin bsa as a standard the activities of nitrate reductase nar nitrite reductase nir nitric oxide reductase nor and nitrous oxide reductase n2or were evaluated by subjecting methyl viologen electron donor to nitrate nitrite no and n2o electron acceptor respectively kristjansson and hollocher 1980 zhu and chen 2011a the assay mixture 1 7 ml contained 10 mm pbs ph 7 4 1 mm methyl viologen 5 mm na2s2o4 and 1 mm electron acceptor nitrate nitrite no or n2o after 30 min of incubation the residual electron acceptor was determined and the specific enzyme activity was calculated other analyses such as nitrate nitrite n2o no acetate lactate nadh nad and cell viability etc were detailed in the supporting information si 2 9 statistical analysis unless otherwise stated all tests were carried out in triplicate and the results were expressed as the mean standard deviation significance among groups was identified by anova with the least significant difference post hoc test spss 20 0 data fitting was calculated using originpro 9 0 software originlab 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of model denitrifier affected by s oneidensis mr 1 as illustrated in fig 1 a the addition of s oneidensis mr 1 caused more decrease of nitrate at a given time for example the residual nitrate was still 6 74 mm in the single p denitrificans reactor at time of 22 h but it was only 0 42 mm in the reactor of mixture of p denitrificans with s oneidensis mr 1 suggesting that the nitrate removal efficiency was increased from 65 3 to 97 8 after s oneidensis mr 1 was added into the p denitrificans reactor it should be emphasized that although s oneidensis mr 1 had been reported to show the ability to biologically reduce nitrate to nitrite and further to ammonium which could cause the decrease in nitrate concentration but the successful exhibition of this kind function were observed to be dependent on enough lactate to provide electrons cruz garcia et al 2007 gao et al 2009 in this study the concentration of lactate was only 2 73 mm and the ratio of lactate to nitrate was 1 7 12 which was much lower than that reported in the literature 10 1 cruz garcia et al 2007 gao et al 2009 thus as seen in fig 1a there was only slight nitrate removal between 3 7 and 5 8 in the reactor of single s oneidensis mr 1 culture also there was no significant increase in the concentration of ammonium nitrogen in the sole culture reactor of s oneidensis mr 1 data not shown it seems that the presence of s oneidensis mr 1 in denitrification system of p denitrificans enhancing nitrate removal was not due to its role in reducing nitrate to ammonium the influences of s oneidensis mr 1 on the variation of two denitrification intermediates nitrite and nitrous oxide were also examined here in the solo p denitrificans culture the concentration of nitrite gradually increased with time and reached the maximal 0 67 mm at time of 15 h which was then decreased to 0 33 mm at the end of the experiment fig 1b in the s oneidensis mr 1 reactor the accumulation of nitrite was almost lineally increased with time with a maximum level of 1 13 mm the generated nitrite was fund to be exact the amount of nitrate declined in the solo s oneidensis mr 1 culture reactor when p denitrificans was cultured with s oneidensis mr 1 however no nitrite was accumulated in the entire experimental time it was also observed that the addition of s oneidensis mr 1 to p denitrificans reactor significantly decreased the accumulation of nitrous oxide from 8 87 μm mm n to no detectable therefore s oneidensis mr 1 facilitated the nitrate removal as well as reduced negative intermediates in denitrification system of p denitrificans 3 2 influence of s oneidensis mr 1 on electron transfer involved in denitrification it is well known that the electrons generated in carbon source metabolism process need to be transferred to nox reductases such as nitrate reductase nar nitrite reductase nir nitric oxide reductase nor and nitrous oxide reductase n2or via respiratory chain consisting of complex i nadh coq reductase and complex iii ubiquinol cytochrome c oxidoreductase during denitrification berks et al 1995 trumpower 1990 thus increasing electron transfer will enhance denitrification efficiency and carbon source utilization and decrease intermediates such as nitrite and nitrous oxide accumulation the effectiveness of this electron transport process can be evaluated by measuring the activities of these two complexes and the whole system li et al 2016a wan et al 2016 the data in fig 2 a indicated that there was a 73 6 increase of the activity of complex i after s oneidensis mr 1 was supplied to the denitrification system of p denitrificans meanwhile the complex iii was promoted by 90 7 as well further analysis of the whole system activity i e electron transport system activity etsa showed that a notably high etsa value was recorded in the mixed culture system 3 12 μg o2 g protein min while it was respectively 2 04 and 1 35 μg o2 g protein min in single culture of p denitrificans and s oneidensis mr 1 fig 2b all these observations were in correspondence with the enhanced denitrification efficiency and carbon source metabolism in the mixed culture system in contrast these three indicators of electron transfer activity were much lower in the single culture of s oneidensis mr 1 s oneidensis mr 1 has the ability to produce conductive nanotubes to accomplish extracellular metal ion reduction within some distance bretschger et al 2007 and more nanotubes facilitate faster direct interspecies electron transfer diet and greater biological reduction performance dubey and ben yehuda 2011 el naggar et al 2010 ha et al 2017 as seen from sem results in fig 3 a there were no notable nanotubes as p denitrificans culture singly which had also been reported previously wan et al 2016 there were also sparse nanotubes appeared in the reactor of single s oneidensis mr 1 culture reactor fig 3b however the scene of co cultured cells of p denitrificans and s oneidensis mr 1 in fig 3c demonstrated many nanotubes between p denitrificans and s oneidensis mr 1 which could be clearly viewed by a closer image of interspecies nanotubes displayed in fig 3d it was reported that p denitrificans could conduct bio reduction of nitrate with electrons form cathode as well as produce electrons and delivery it to the anode in microbial fuel cells mfcs kiely et al 2010 vilar sanz et al 2013 it seems that p denitrificans owned the ability to receive extracellular electrons from s oneidensis mr 1 to facilitate denitrification further analysis showed that the average number of nanotubes was respectively 10 and 53 in the single s oneidensis mr 1 culture and co culture system fig s3 supporting information cell cell contact as seen in fig s4 supporting information has been also reported to facilitate diet in an energy saving way ha et al 2017 summers et al 2010 3 3 influence of s oneidensis mr 1 on the activity of key denitrifying enzyme nitrate is reduced to nitrite nitric oxide nitrous oxide and finally nitrogen gas which is catalyzed respectively by nar nir nor and n2or during bio denitrification as the activities of reductases were usually related to the reduction rate of the corresponding nitrogen oxide their activities were investigated to explore the influence of s oneidensis mr 1 further pan et al 2013 zhu and chen 2011b the data showed that the activity of all denitrification enzymes measured in the reactor of sole s oneidensis mr 1 was relatively low and that of nor and n2or was even under detection limit nevertheless its addition to the reactor of p denitrificans resulted in the increase of all denitrification enzymes fig 4 compared with the single culture of p denitrificans the activities of denitrification reductases in the mixed culture were increased by 22 6 nar 32 5 nir 23 2 nor and 44 7 n2or it can also be fund that the supplement of s oneidensis mr 1 caused more increase of the activity of n2or than that of nor this observation was consistent with the result that no n2o was detected with the presence of s oneidensis mr 1 in the denitrification system 3 4 influence of s oneidensis mr 1 on carbon source metabolism and reduction equivalent production by p denitrificans anaerobic denitrification includes two interrelated biochemical reactions i e carbon source acetate metabolism via tricarboxylic acid tca cycle with the productions of nadh and atp and biological reduction of nitrate with the produced nadh tang et al 2007 in the current study acetate and lactate were supplied respectively as the carbon sources of p denitrificans and s oneidensis mr 1 which had been reported to be the preferred ones in the literatures oh and silverstein 1999 pinchuk et al 2011 as seen in fig 5 a the acetate concentration in the denitrification reactor of p denitrificans i e p denitrificans acetate changed from 39 24 to 18 99 mm after p denitrificans and s oneidensis mr 1 were cultured together i e p denitrificans s oneidensis mr 1 acetate lactate however the final acetate concentration was decreased to 12 27 mm it was found that the addition of lactate to the reactor of sole p denitrificans p denitrificans acetate lactate did not significant increase the consumption of acetate fig 5a also p denitrificans with the presence of acetate and lactate showed no obvious difference in nitrate reduction fig s5a supporting information further investigation indicated that no matter whether lactate was present or not there was marginal utilization of acetate by s oneidensis mr 1 see s oneidensis mr 1 acetate and s oneidensis mr 1 acetate lactate in fig 5a therefore the presence of s oneidensis mr 1 promoted the metabolism of acetate by p denitrificans which resulted in more nadh being produced in this study small amount of lactate was provided to serve as the carbon source of s oneidensis mr 1 although lactate could also be utilized by p denitrificans it was noted that there was only 0 16 mmol of lactate fig s5b supporting information being utilized in the mix culture reactor which would generate 1 92 mmol of electron in maximum if this amount of electron was transferred to p denitrificans completely it could only achieve 0 38 mmol nitrate reduction from nitrate to nitrogen gas however the increase of nitrate reduction in the current study was 0 70 mmol derived from its concentration being decreased from 6 74 to 0 42 mm in a medium volume of 110 ml it seems that more electrons were produced when s oneidensis mr 1 was supplemented to the denitrification system of p denitrificans this observation was in correspondence with more acetate being consumed by the addition of s oneidensis mr 1 as seen in fig 5b the atp content in the reactor of mixed p denitrificans and s oneidensis mr 1 was 45 2 and 74 7 greater than that of p denitrificans and s oneidensis mr 1 under anaerobic conditions more intracellular atp was reported to result in greater cell viability chung and neethling 1988 zhang et al 2010 which agreed well with the observation made in the current study fig 5c specifically the cell viability in the mix culture reactor was promoted to 142 3 compared with that the single culture reactor of p denitrificans nadh nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide is the primary electron donor for bio reduction of nitrate and a higher nadh production is linked to a greater nitrate bio reduction chen and strous 2013 li et al 2016b nevertheless the presence of other microbes such as s oneidensis mr 1 affecting the production of nadh in denitrification process has never been investigated fig 5d compared the relative levels of nadh in the reactor of single p denitrificans and those in the culture of p denitrificans and s oneidensis mr 1 also the result of nadh in the single s oneidensis mr 1 reactor was provided the level of nadh in the mixed culture system increased by 54 2 of that in the single p denitrificans one set at 100 and treated as control fig 5d it was noted that the nadh content in the single s oneidensis mr 1 reactor was only 45 8 of the control suggesting that the increase of nadh caused by s oneidensis mr 1 was due to its positive influence on nadh production process involved in p denitrificans metabolism which will be addressed in the following text the redox reaction of cofactor pair nadh nad is a crucial to reflect intracellular potential reducing equivalent which can lead to continued reduction of the uqh2 uq pool and further predominate the rate of cyclic electron transport to facilitate the reduction of nitrate nitrite no and n2o continuously berks et al 1995 berrios rivera et al 2002 the total levels of nadh and nad in the reactors of single and mix cultures were further compared and their total amount was 1 63 μmol mg protein min in mixed culture which was 1 3 and 2 6 folds of that in single p denitrificans and s oneidensis mr 1 ones it implied that more nadh and nad participated in the redox reaction a positive relationship between the ratio of nadh nad and nitrate removal efficiency has also been reported in the literature wan et al 2018 compared with the control reactor the nadh nad ratio was increased by 38 9 after s oneidensis mr 1 addition fig 5d apparently supplement of s oneidensis mr 1 into the denitrification system facilitated a more reductive environment for bio reduction of nitrate or its intermediates which was also an important reason for higher denitrification efficiency and less nitrite and n2o accumulations being observed in the current study the essence of denitrification is the reduction of nox by corresponding reductase with electrons and this procedure is usually retarded by the imbalance of electrons generation and consumption which causes incomplete denitrification and builds up of nitrite nitric oxide or nitrous oxide chen and strous 2013 the denitrification process involves the generation and consumption of electrons but at a given time some microorganisms may be in the stage of electrons generation while others are in the state of electrons consumption due to microbial individual differences according to the results observed in the current study it was proposed that the electrons generated in some microbial cells were transmitted through nanotubes which were formed between cells in the presence of s oneidensis mr 1 to other microbes in the state of electrons consumption thus not only the consumption of electrons was improved but the generation of electrons was increased which were in viewed by greater denitrification enzymes activity and more acetate metabolism the proposed mechanism for denitrification of p denitrificans enhanced by s oneidensis mr 1 is illustrated in fig 6 3 5 denitrification of groundwater enhanced by supplement of s oneidensis mr 1 the feasibility of s oneidensis mr 1 increasing denitrification performance with reduction of nitrite accumulation and n2o emission was evaluated by the groundwater denitrification experiments and the results are shown in fig 7 without s oneidensis mr 1 supplement the nitrate concentration in the control was 0 83 mm at the end of experiments which was however 0 08 mm after s oneidensis mr 1 addition fig 7a the presence of s oneidensis mr 1 increased the nitrate removal efficiency from 76 3 to 97 7 the observed maximum no2 n and n2o was respectively reduced from 0 158 to 0 049 mm and 8 6 to 3 5 μm mm n with s oneidensis mr 1 supplement by the end of the experiments no2 n n2o and ammonium were all non detectable in the s oneidensis mr 1 added system fig 7b c and 7d this study provided a new perspective to approach nitrate contamination in groundwater with the interaction between denitrifies and the other microorganism as seen from this study the presence of s oneidensis mr 1 in denitrification system not only increased the efficiency of nitrate reduction but also reduced nitrite accumulation and nitrous oxide emission in groundwater which would be of great significance to attenuate toxic nitrite pollution and global warming 4 conclusions as observed in the above study that s oneidensis mr 1 significantly improved the activity of complex i complex iii and etsa via the formed nanotubes and then facilitated the delivery of electrons to nox reductases with improved efficiency in electron transfer the activity of nox reductases was promoted for receiving electrons readily at the same time it suggested that the consumption of electrons for nox reduction was increased in the co culture denitrification system at the same time the electrons generation capability of the cu culture denitrification system also enhanced all these resulted in the enhancement of nitrate removal efficiency and the decrease of nitrite accumulation and nitrous oxide emission in both model denitrifier and biological groundwater denitrification process s oneidensis mr 1 has shown significantly potential in regulating nitrogen cycle in natural environment such as river ocean and

18351,bio denitrification i e microbial reduction of nitrate to gaseous nitrogen is usually reported to be affected by operating and environmental parameters such as carbon source type ph value and temperature in this paper the enhancement of denitrification performance with the elimination of nitrite accumulation and nitrous oxide emission by shewanella oneidensis mr 1 were investigated and the mechanisms were explored it was found that s oneidensis mr 1 itself had marginal nitrate removal capacity but its presence in the denitrification system of a well studied denitrifier paracoccus denitrificans obviously enhanced nitrate removal efficiency from 65 3 to 97 8 and reduced nitrite accumulation 0 67 against none detectable and n2o generation from 8 87 μm mm tn to none detectable the mechanism study showed that s oneidensis mr 1 promoted electrons transfer activity via the formation of nanotube between cells which resulted in the increase of denitrification enzymes activity carbon source metabolism atp level and cell viability as the generation transfer and consumption of electrons were enhanced by s oneidensis mr 1 the improvement of denitrification performance with reduction of nitrite accumulation and n2o emission was therefore achieved finally the performance of denitrification enhanced by s oneidensis mr 1 was testified by laboratory groundwater treatment experiment this study suggested the potential role of s oneidensis mr 1 in accelerating nitrate bio transformation in nitrogen geochemical cycle and increasing bio treatment of nitrate contamination with negligible harmful intermediates nitrite and n2o accumulation graphical abstract image 1 keywords denitrification shewanella oneidensis mr 1 nitrite n2o nadh electrons 1 introduction the beginning of the 21st century has witnessed continued inputs of reactive nitrogen to the biosphere by anthropogenic activities and the aggregation of nitrogen by the end of this century will be 600 tg n yr 1 particularly through combustion emissions nitrogen fertilizers usage and biological and agricultural nitrogen fixation burow et al 2010 fowler et al 2015 it was reported that global nitrogen cycle would subject to collapse if excrescent nitrogen lost its way into atmosphere as nitrogen gas dalsgaard et al 2003 nitrate is particularly mobile through both water and soil and excess nitrate from sewage agricultural fertilizers or intensive farming easily makes its direction into underground aquifers and surface waters it is a necessary nutrient but its excessive input in aquatic ecosystem can cause environmental pollution and security problem which has been widely concerned by researchers ballantine et al 2014 bio denitrification plays an important role in the cycle of biosphere nitrogen microbial denitrification has the advantages of convenient operation and small secondary pollution which has been extensively applied to reduce or remove nitrate from the contaminated environments such as groundwater it has been reported that biological nitrate removal is affected by the environmental and operating parameters such as carbon source ph value and temperature lu et al 2014 to biological denitrification of municipal wastewater and groundwater the biggest challenge is the low denitrification efficiency caused by low bioavailability of carbon even if the organic matter contained in the water is hydrolyzed it is difficult to achieve the carbon to nitrogen ratio bod5 tkn 5 required for biological nitrogen removal gu and onnis hayden 2010 huno et al 2018 rivett et al 2008 also toxic nitrous oxide n2o can easily generate in biological denitrification process itokawa et al 2001 thus many efforts have been tried to increase the biotransformation of nitrate for example by the supplement of external carbon sources such as methanol ethanol or acetate the denitrification performance can be remarkably enhanced salminen et al 2014 smith et al 2001 nevertheless it increases process costs and inaccurate dosing of carbon sources can cause secondary pollution ballantine et al 2014 biological denitrification requires the participation of electrons to consecutively reduce nitrate to nitrite nitric oxide nitrous oxide and finally nitrogen gas to achieve this heterotrophic denitrifiers metabolize carbon source to produce the direct electron donor nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nadh which is then transferred via electron transport system i e nadh dehydrogenase complex i the quinone pool bc1 complex complex iii and cytochrome c to corresponding denitrification reductases berks et al 1995 thus increasing electrons generation transport and consumption will promote the sequential biochemical reactions involved in denitrification process until now however the study on the use of non chemical method to simultaneously increase electrons generation transport and consumption to enhance denitrification performance with reduction of nitrite accumulation and n2o emission in microbial denitrification process has never been documented shewanella oneidensis was reported in various niches such as lake oneida dark sea hot spring and the columbia river ghosh et al 2003 turse et al 2010 venkateswaran et al 1999 and has been frequently studied as a promising microbe in environmental bioremediation min et al 2017 szczuka et al 2015 in this paper the enhancement of denitrification performance with the reduction of nitrite accumulation and n2o emission by shewanella oneidensis mr 1 was investigated and the mechanism was explored further firstly the denitrification performance of a frequently used denitrifier paracoccus denitrificans in the presence and absence of s oneidensis mr 1 was compared as the addition of s oneidensis mr 1 enhanced the performance of denitrification and solo cultured s oneidensis mr 1 showed marginal nitrate removal the mechanism of s oneidensis mr 1 in denitrification system was then explored by the investigations of carbon source metabolism nadh production electron transport and enzymatic activity involved in denitrification finally the feasibility of using s oneidensis mr 1 to enhance denitrification performance was evaluated in a laboratory groundwater bio treatment system for future practical application 2 materials and methods 2 1 source of microbes p denitrificans atcc 19367 a widely used denitrifying bacterium in the literature fig s1 supporting information was adopted as a model denitrifying microbe in this study s oneidensis mr 1 atcc 700550 and p denitrificans atcc 19367 were stored at 80 c prior to use they were routinely cultured in lb luria bertani broth aerobically with bath shaker 150 rpm at 30 c until the late logarithmic growth phase then cells were harvested by centrifugation 4500 rpm for 5 min washed twice with 0 1 m pbs ph 7 4 and re suspended in pbs before use ground soil was withdrawn from a depth of 2 m below the earth s surface in the campus of tongij university 1239 siping road shanghai 200092 china it was sealed in a pe hermetic bag and transported to the laboratory immediately after being sieved through 2 mm mesh and homogenized the soil was then used as the seed for groundwater denitrification experiments 2 2 medium of denitrification in the denitrification experiments of model denitrifier the basic medium was a modified version of that used as our previously described which contained 21 36 mm kno3 10 66 mm nh4cl 17 93 mm kh2po4 32 76 mm na2hpo4 0 41 mm mgso4 7h2o 5 ml trace metals and 10 ml vitamin solution cruz garcia et al 2007 wan et al 2016 an amount of 43 17 mm ch3coona was added for biomass growth and nitrate reduction according to our previously result as acetate was not the preferred carbon source for s oneidensis mr 1 a small amount of l lactate 3 00 mm was supplemented by default into bottles where this strain was seeded unless special instructions gao et al 2009 the initial medium ph was adjusted to 7 2 with 2 0 m hcl and 2 0 m naoh anaerobic condition was achieved by extensively purging the medium with o2 free n2 15 min into 160 ml glass serum bottles which were then sealed with black butyl stoppers and autoclaved at 121 c 0 12 mpa for 15 min to prevent precipitate formation mgso4 7h2o trace metals and vitamins were autoclaved 200 fold stock solutions separately and then added to the serum bottles by syringe the total volume of the medium was 100 ml in the groundwater denitrification experiments the main ions reported by the latest shanghai geological environmental bulletin http www shgtj gov cn dzkc dzhjbg 201412 t20141215 642773 html were prepared according to their average concentrations measured in groundwater sampling points table s1 supporting information namely 1 55 mm nacl 1 75 mm mgcl2 6h2o 2 38 mm ca hco3 2 2 60 mm nahco3 0 02 mm nh4cl 0 51 mm no3 n and 0 009 mm kno2 as the concentration of no3 n in real groundwater also varied and in order to maintain a stable initial nitrate kno3 was added to reach a final concentration of 3 50 mm no3 n in all tests to monitor a higher nitrate contamination in groundwater according to previous reports wang et al 2009 10 00 mm ch3coona and 1 00 mm l lactate were added as the carbon sources for groundwater denitrification experiments 2 3 experiments of the performance of model denitrifier affected by s oneidensis mr 1 prior to the experiments the amount of s oneidensis mr 1 added to the denitrification system of model denitrifier was determined by investigating the influence of different inoculated ratios of od600 of p denitrificans to s oneidensis mr 1 i e p s on the removal efficiency of nitrate in the reactors the od600 of inoculated p denitrificans was maintained at 0 02 but that of s oneidensis mr 1 was changed according to the studied ratio of p s it was found that the nitrate removal efficiency was increased with the increase of s oneidensis mr 1 addition fig s2 supporting information in this study only one ratio of p s i e 1 5 was taken as an example to investigate the performance and mechanisms of model denitrifier affected by s oneidensis mr 1 in the following text the experiment procedure was conducted as follows nine anaerobic bottles were used and 100 ml of denitrification medium was added to each one these bottles were divided equally into three groups m 1 m 2 and m 3 see table 1 p denitrificans was inoculated to the bottles of m 1 and m 2 with an od600 of 0 02 in each bottle and s oneidensis mr 1 was seeded to each bottle in m 2 and m 3 with an od600 of 0 10 then 0 1 m pbs was used to adjust the total volume of liquid medium in each one to 110 ml all bottles were maintained in an air bath shaker 150 rpm at 30 1 c samples were withdrawn by syringe at different time and were filtered through 0 22 μm membrane filters before wet analyses being conducted 2 4 batch tests of lactate and s oneidensis mr 1 affecting acetate utilization by p denitrificans in the current study there were two different microbes i e p denitrificans and s oneidensis mr 1 and acetate and lactate were their carbon sources respectively although the amount of lactate was much lower than that of acetate and the sole culture of s oneidensis mr 1 itself contributed marginally to denitrification their presence on acetate utilization by p denitrificans need to be investigated also the presence of acetate and p denitrificans on the utilization of lactate by s oneidensis mr 1 was studied the batch tests were conducted in fifteen anaerobic bottles which were divided equally into five groups c 1 c 2 c 3 c 4 and c 5 and the details were the same as those described in section 2 3 except for the carbon source and inoculator see table 1 2 5 experiments of groundwater denitrification affected by s oneidensis mr 1 six anaerobic bottles were used and 300 ml synthetic groundwater was added to each one these bottles were divided equally into two groups i e r 1 and r 2 and r 1 without s oneidensis mr 1 supplement was served as the control s oneidensis mr 1 was supplemented to each bottle in r 2 with a final od600 of 0 2 in order to simulate the actual groundwater environment ground soil was seeded to both r 1 and r 2 see table 1 with concentration of 5 0 g l each after being flushed with n2 for 15 min to remove oxygen all bottles were capped with rubber stoppers sealed and placed in an air bath shaker 80 rpm at 30 1 c samples were withdrawn at different time and liquid samples were then filtered through 0 22 μm membrane filters before analyses 2 6 assays of complex i complex iii and electron transport system activity etsa to prepare crude cell extracts for complex i and complex iii assays cells after the experiment were harvested washed twice with 0 1 m pbs ph 7 4 and re suspended in pbs the crude was then obtained by sonication 20 khz 5min 4 c and centrifugation 10 min 14000 g 4 c the activity of complex i was estimated by measuring the decrease of nadh at 340 nm the reaction mixture 1 ml contained 100 μm nadh 50 μm ubiquinone aladdin china and 300 μl of cell extract humphries and szweda 1998 besides 5 μm azoxystrobin aladdin china was added to eliminate nadh consumption by complex iii esser et al 2004 the activity of complex iii was determined by monitoring the reduction of cytochrome c at 550 nm the reaction mixture 1 ml contained 0 5 mm edta 50 μm oxidized cytochrome c 40 μm of ubiquinol 2 and 300 μl of cell extract veitch et al 1992 the ubiquinol 2 was obtained by reducing 8 mm ubiquinone 2 dissolved in ethanoic solution by solid borohydride acidification with hci and subsequent extraction in cyclohexane the etsa was determined by reducing 2 p iodophenyl 3 p nitrophenyl 5 phenyl tetrazolium chloride int a kind of exogenous electron acceptor to formazan hu et al 2018 according to the literature broberg 1985 cells were washed twice with 0 05 m pbs ph 7 4 200 μl of int 0 5 and 0 2 mg nadh were added into 1 ml of the above resuspended bacteria and 100 μl of formaldehyde was added to stop the reaction after dark incubation at 30 c for 30 min inf in the centrifuged bacteria was extract twice with 500 μl of 96 methanol and the inf extract was measured at 490 nm the etsa was finally calculated by transforming of μm int formazan to μg o2 2 7 high resolution scanning electron microscopy hr sem analysis the bacterial morphology was analyzed by hr sem image after a succession of treatment steps according to the literature dubey and ben yehuda 2011 briefly cells after above experiment were dropped on the carbon film surface of a copper grid 200 mesh from beijing zhongjingkeyi technology co ltd and then set still for 30 min to facilitate the attachment of cell on it this procedure was conducted in an anaerobic glove box 20 co2 80 n2 after that cells on grid were gently washed with 0 1 m sodium cacodylate buffer na ch3 2aso2 3h2o ph 7 2 and then fixed with 2 0 glutaraldehyde in sodium cacodylate buffer 0 1 m ph 7 2 at 25 c for 2 h next cells were post fixed by incubation with 1 osmium tetroxide at 25 c in the dark for 1 h and then dehydrated by exposure to a graded series of ethanol washes 25 50 75 95 and 100 10 min each finally the grid attached cells were washed with a graded series of freon 113 25 50 75 95 and 100 freon in ethanol 10 min each specimens were coated with gold by quorum technologies sc7640 sputter coater and cells were observed using zeiss supra 55 scanning electron microscope 2 8 other analytical methods the protein concentration of cell extracts was measured using protein assay kit bio rad with bovine serum albumin bsa as a standard the activities of nitrate reductase nar nitrite reductase nir nitric oxide reductase nor and nitrous oxide reductase n2or were evaluated by subjecting methyl viologen electron donor to nitrate nitrite no and n2o electron acceptor respectively kristjansson and hollocher 1980 zhu and chen 2011a the assay mixture 1 7 ml contained 10 mm pbs ph 7 4 1 mm methyl viologen 5 mm na2s2o4 and 1 mm electron acceptor nitrate nitrite no or n2o after 30 min of incubation the residual electron acceptor was determined and the specific enzyme activity was calculated other analyses such as nitrate nitrite n2o no acetate lactate nadh nad and cell viability etc were detailed in the supporting information si 2 9 statistical analysis unless otherwise stated all tests were carried out in triplicate and the results were expressed as the mean standard deviation significance among groups was identified by anova with the least significant difference post hoc test spss 20 0 data fitting was calculated using originpro 9 0 software originlab 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of model denitrifier affected by s oneidensis mr 1 as illustrated in fig 1 a the addition of s oneidensis mr 1 caused more decrease of nitrate at a given time for example the residual nitrate was still 6 74 mm in the single p denitrificans reactor at time of 22 h but it was only 0 42 mm in the reactor of mixture of p denitrificans with s oneidensis mr 1 suggesting that the nitrate removal efficiency was increased from 65 3 to 97 8 after s oneidensis mr 1 was added into the p denitrificans reactor it should be emphasized that although s oneidensis mr 1 had been reported to show the ability to biologically reduce nitrate to nitrite and further to ammonium which could cause the decrease in nitrate concentration but the successful exhibition of this kind function were observed to be dependent on enough lactate to provide electrons cruz garcia et al 2007 gao et al 2009 in this study the concentration of lactate was only 2 73 mm and the ratio of lactate to nitrate was 1 7 12 which was much lower than that reported in the literature 10 1 cruz garcia et al 2007 gao et al 2009 thus as seen in fig 1a there was only slight nitrate removal between 3 7 and 5 8 in the reactor of single s oneidensis mr 1 culture also there was no significant increase in the concentration of ammonium nitrogen in the sole culture reactor of s oneidensis mr 1 data not shown it seems that the presence of s oneidensis mr 1 in denitrification system of p denitrificans enhancing nitrate removal was not due to its role in reducing nitrate to ammonium the influences of s oneidensis mr 1 on the variation of two denitrification intermediates nitrite and nitrous oxide were also examined here in the solo p denitrificans culture the concentration of nitrite gradually increased with time and reached the maximal 0 67 mm at time of 15 h which was then decreased to 0 33 mm at the end of the experiment fig 1b in the s oneidensis mr 1 reactor the accumulation of nitrite was almost lineally increased with time with a maximum level of 1 13 mm the generated nitrite was fund to be exact the amount of nitrate declined in the solo s oneidensis mr 1 culture reactor when p denitrificans was cultured with s oneidensis mr 1 however no nitrite was accumulated in the entire experimental time it was also observed that the addition of s oneidensis mr 1 to p denitrificans reactor significantly decreased the accumulation of nitrous oxide from 8 87 μm mm n to no detectable therefore s oneidensis mr 1 facilitated the nitrate removal as well as reduced negative intermediates in denitrification system of p denitrificans 3 2 influence of s oneidensis mr 1 on electron transfer involved in denitrification it is well known that the electrons generated in carbon source metabolism process need to be transferred to nox reductases such as nitrate reductase nar nitrite reductase nir nitric oxide reductase nor and nitrous oxide reductase n2or via respiratory chain consisting of complex i nadh coq reductase and complex iii ubiquinol cytochrome c oxidoreductase during denitrification berks et al 1995 trumpower 1990 thus increasing electron transfer will enhance denitrification efficiency and carbon source utilization and decrease intermediates such as nitrite and nitrous oxide accumulation the effectiveness of this electron transport process can be evaluated by measuring the activities of these two complexes and the whole system li et al 2016a wan et al 2016 the data in fig 2 a indicated that there was a 73 6 increase of the activity of complex i after s oneidensis mr 1 was supplied to the denitrification system of p denitrificans meanwhile the complex iii was promoted by 90 7 as well further analysis of the whole system activity i e electron transport system activity etsa showed that a notably high etsa value was recorded in the mixed culture system 3 12 μg o2 g protein min while it was respectively 2 04 and 1 35 μg o2 g protein min in single culture of p denitrificans and s oneidensis mr 1 fig 2b all these observations were in correspondence with the enhanced denitrification efficiency and carbon source metabolism in the mixed culture system in contrast these three indicators of electron transfer activity were much lower in the single culture of s oneidensis mr 1 s oneidensis mr 1 has the ability to produce conductive nanotubes to accomplish extracellular metal ion reduction within some distance bretschger et al 2007 and more nanotubes facilitate faster direct interspecies electron transfer diet and greater biological reduction performance dubey and ben yehuda 2011 el naggar et al 2010 ha et al 2017 as seen from sem results in fig 3 a there were no notable nanotubes as p denitrificans culture singly which had also been reported previously wan et al 2016 there were also sparse nanotubes appeared in the reactor of single s oneidensis mr 1 culture reactor fig 3b however the scene of co cultured cells of p denitrificans and s oneidensis mr 1 in fig 3c demonstrated many nanotubes between p denitrificans and s oneidensis mr 1 which could be clearly viewed by a closer image of interspecies nanotubes displayed in fig 3d it was reported that p denitrificans could conduct bio reduction of nitrate with electrons form cathode as well as produce electrons and delivery it to the anode in microbial fuel cells mfcs kiely et al 2010 vilar sanz et al 2013 it seems that p denitrificans owned the ability to receive extracellular electrons from s oneidensis mr 1 to facilitate denitrification further analysis showed that the average number of nanotubes was respectively 10 and 53 in the single s oneidensis mr 1 culture and co culture system fig s3 supporting information cell cell contact as seen in fig s4 supporting information has been also reported to facilitate diet in an energy saving way ha et al 2017 summers et al 2010 3 3 influence of s oneidensis mr 1 on the activity of key denitrifying enzyme nitrate is reduced to nitrite nitric oxide nitrous oxide and finally nitrogen gas which is catalyzed respectively by nar nir nor and n2or during bio denitrification as the activities of reductases were usually related to the reduction rate of the corresponding nitrogen oxide their activities were investigated to explore the influence of s oneidensis mr 1 further pan et al 2013 zhu and chen 2011b the data showed that the activity of all denitrification enzymes measured in the reactor of sole s oneidensis mr 1 was relatively low and that of nor and n2or was even under detection limit nevertheless its addition to the reactor of p denitrificans resulted in the increase of all denitrification enzymes fig 4 compared with the single culture of p denitrificans the activities of denitrification reductases in the mixed culture were increased by 22 6 nar 32 5 nir 23 2 nor and 44 7 n2or it can also be fund that the supplement of s oneidensis mr 1 caused more increase of the activity of n2or than that of nor this observation was consistent with the result that no n2o was detected with the presence of s oneidensis mr 1 in the denitrification system 3 4 influence of s oneidensis mr 1 on carbon source metabolism and reduction equivalent production by p denitrificans anaerobic denitrification includes two interrelated biochemical reactions i e carbon source acetate metabolism via tricarboxylic acid tca cycle with the productions of nadh and atp and biological reduction of nitrate with the produced nadh tang et al 2007 in the current study acetate and lactate were supplied respectively as the carbon sources of p denitrificans and s oneidensis mr 1 which had been reported to be the preferred ones in the literatures oh and silverstein 1999 pinchuk et al 2011 as seen in fig 5 a the acetate concentration in the denitrification reactor of p denitrificans i e p denitrificans acetate changed from 39 24 to 18 99 mm after p denitrificans and s oneidensis mr 1 were cultured together i e p denitrificans s oneidensis mr 1 acetate lactate however the final acetate concentration was decreased to 12 27 mm it was found that the addition of lactate to the reactor of sole p denitrificans p denitrificans acetate lactate did not significant increase the consumption of acetate fig 5a also p denitrificans with the presence of acetate and lactate showed no obvious difference in nitrate reduction fig s5a supporting information further investigation indicated that no matter whether lactate was present or not there was marginal utilization of acetate by s oneidensis mr 1 see s oneidensis mr 1 acetate and s oneidensis mr 1 acetate lactate in fig 5a therefore the presence of s oneidensis mr 1 promoted the metabolism of acetate by p denitrificans which resulted in more nadh being produced in this study small amount of lactate was provided to serve as the carbon source of s oneidensis mr 1 although lactate could also be utilized by p denitrificans it was noted that there was only 0 16 mmol of lactate fig s5b supporting information being utilized in the mix culture reactor which would generate 1 92 mmol of electron in maximum if this amount of electron was transferred to p denitrificans completely it could only achieve 0 38 mmol nitrate reduction from nitrate to nitrogen gas however the increase of nitrate reduction in the current study was 0 70 mmol derived from its concentration being decreased from 6 74 to 0 42 mm in a medium volume of 110 ml it seems that more electrons were produced when s oneidensis mr 1 was supplemented to the denitrification system of p denitrificans this observation was in correspondence with more acetate being consumed by the addition of s oneidensis mr 1 as seen in fig 5b the atp content in the reactor of mixed p denitrificans and s oneidensis mr 1 was 45 2 and 74 7 greater than that of p denitrificans and s oneidensis mr 1 under anaerobic conditions more intracellular atp was reported to result in greater cell viability chung and neethling 1988 zhang et al 2010 which agreed well with the observation made in the current study fig 5c specifically the cell viability in the mix culture reactor was promoted to 142 3 compared with that the single culture reactor of p denitrificans nadh nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide is the primary electron donor for bio reduction of nitrate and a higher nadh production is linked to a greater nitrate bio reduction chen and strous 2013 li et al 2016b nevertheless the presence of other microbes such as s oneidensis mr 1 affecting the production of nadh in denitrification process has never been investigated fig 5d compared the relative levels of nadh in the reactor of single p denitrificans and those in the culture of p denitrificans and s oneidensis mr 1 also the result of nadh in the single s oneidensis mr 1 reactor was provided the level of nadh in the mixed culture system increased by 54 2 of that in the single p denitrificans one set at 100 and treated as control fig 5d it was noted that the nadh content in the single s oneidensis mr 1 reactor was only 45 8 of the control suggesting that the increase of nadh caused by s oneidensis mr 1 was due to its positive influence on nadh production process involved in p denitrificans metabolism which will be addressed in the following text the redox reaction of cofactor pair nadh nad is a crucial to reflect intracellular potential reducing equivalent which can lead to continued reduction of the uqh2 uq pool and further predominate the rate of cyclic electron transport to facilitate the reduction of nitrate nitrite no and n2o continuously berks et al 1995 berrios rivera et al 2002 the total levels of nadh and nad in the reactors of single and mix cultures were further compared and their total amount was 1 63 μmol mg protein min in mixed culture which was 1 3 and 2 6 folds of that in single p denitrificans and s oneidensis mr 1 ones it implied that more nadh and nad participated in the redox reaction a positive relationship between the ratio of nadh nad and nitrate removal efficiency has also been reported in the literature wan et al 2018 compared with the control reactor the nadh nad ratio was increased by 38 9 after s oneidensis mr 1 addition fig 5d apparently supplement of s oneidensis mr 1 into the denitrification system facilitated a more reductive environment for bio reduction of nitrate or its intermediates which was also an important reason for higher denitrification efficiency and less nitrite and n2o accumulations being observed in the current study the essence of denitrification is the reduction of nox by corresponding reductase with electrons and this procedure is usually retarded by the imbalance of electrons generation and consumption which causes incomplete denitrification and builds up of nitrite nitric oxide or nitrous oxide chen and strous 2013 the denitrification process involves the generation and consumption of electrons but at a given time some microorganisms may be in the stage of electrons generation while others are in the state of electrons consumption due to microbial individual differences according to the results observed in the current study it was proposed that the electrons generated in some microbial cells were transmitted through nanotubes which were formed between cells in the presence of s oneidensis mr 1 to other microbes in the state of electrons consumption thus not only the consumption of electrons was improved but the generation of electrons was increased which were in viewed by greater denitrification enzymes activity and more acetate metabolism the proposed mechanism for denitrification of p denitrificans enhanced by s oneidensis mr 1 is illustrated in fig 6 3 5 denitrification of groundwater enhanced by supplement of s oneidensis mr 1 the feasibility of s oneidensis mr 1 increasing denitrification performance with reduction of nitrite accumulation and n2o emission was evaluated by the groundwater denitrification experiments and the results are shown in fig 7 without s oneidensis mr 1 supplement the nitrate concentration in the control was 0 83 mm at the end of experiments which was however 0 08 mm after s oneidensis mr 1 addition fig 7a the presence of s oneidensis mr 1 increased the nitrate removal efficiency from 76 3 to 97 7 the observed maximum no2 n and n2o was respectively reduced from 0 158 to 0 049 mm and 8 6 to 3 5 μm mm n with s oneidensis mr 1 supplement by the end of the experiments no2 n n2o and ammonium were all non detectable in the s oneidensis mr 1 added system fig 7b c and 7d this study provided a new perspective to approach nitrate contamination in groundwater with the interaction between denitrifies and the other microorganism as seen from this study the presence of s oneidensis mr 1 in denitrification system not only increased the efficiency of nitrate reduction but also reduced nitrite accumulation and nitrous oxide emission in groundwater which would be of great significance to attenuate toxic nitrite pollution and global warming 4 conclusions as observed in the above study that s oneidensis mr 1 significantly improved the activity of complex i complex iii and etsa via the formed nanotubes and then facilitated the delivery of electrons to nox reductases with improved efficiency in electron transfer the activity of nox reductases was promoted for receiving electrons readily at the same time it suggested that the consumption of electrons for nox reduction was increased in the co culture denitrification system at the same time the electrons generation capability of the cu culture denitrification system also enhanced all these resulted in the enhancement of nitrate removal efficiency and the decrease of nitrite accumulation and nitrous oxide emission in both

18352,anammox bacteria tend to self aggregate and biofilm based anammox processes are widely used as sustainable alternative methods for nitrogen removal from wastewater however the mechanism for the initial adhesion of anammox bacteria remains unclear in this work extracellular polymeric substances eps were extracted separately from anammox granules and then characterized by multi methods the adhesion properties of anammox consortia to biotic and abiotic surfaces were examined separately before and after the extraction of three stratified eps using aggregation assays and a quartz crystal microbalance technique with dissipation monitoring respectively the extraction of each of the three stratified eps gradually increased the initial aggregation of anammox consortia from 77 6 3 0 to 85 2 2 6 fourier transform infrared spectrometry confirmed that the aggregation of anammox consortia depended largely on the interactions between functional groups on the cell surfaces all three stratified eps had positive effects on the initial adhesion rate and mass of anammox consortia to abiotic surfaces more importantly the structure of the adhered layer was more compact before the extraction of each of the three stratified eps we therefore hypothesized that the initial adhesion among anammox consortia was due to the ability of the anammox bacteria to express adhesion molecules on the bacterial surfaces and that the three stratified eps were excreted to adhere inert particulates and form a compact biofilm structure this study clarifies the role of stratified eps on the initial formation of anammox biofilms and provides a theoretical basis for accelerating the formation of anammox biofilms graphical abstract image 1 keywords anammox biofilm extracellular polymeric substances eps structure nitrogen removal 1 introduction processing wastewater using anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox bacteria is an energy saving and environmentally friendly alternative to traditional nitrification and denitrification processes for the removal of nitrogen compounds from wastewater hulle et al 2010 lackner et al 2014 anammox bacteria are prone to form bioaggregates ali et al 2018 chen et al 2013 egli et al 2001 such as anammox biofilms or granules auto aggregating biofilms the aggregation of bacteria increases biomass concentrations rittmann 2018 and improves settleability winkler et al 2012 and tolerance to environmental stresses adav et al 2008 also because they are slow growing bacteria doubling time of 2 1 12 days lotti et al 2015 star et al 2007 wrl et al 2010 zhang et al 2017 the aggregation of anammox bacteria is an effective mean of preventing biomass washout and reducing reactor startup time niu et al 2016 strous et al 1998 these advantages have spurred great efforts to accelerate the formation of anammox biofilms fernández et al 2008 graaff et al 2011 ni et al 2010 biofilm based anammox processes have already been extensively used in full scale wastewater treatment plants around the world lackner et al 2014 however the inherent mechanism for initial anammox bacteria aggregation remains unclear sticky extracellular polymeric substances eps released by bacteria play a crucial role in the process of sludge aggregation hou et al 2015 peeters and van niftrik 2019 eps are hypothesized to bridge bacteria with other bacteria or inert particulates such as carrier surfaces silts and nuclei into an aggregate thus facilitating the formation of biofilms adav et al 2008 liu and tay 2004 as a predominant component of anammox sludge feng et al 2019 lotti et al 2019 proteins pn seem to be the most important factor in anammox biofilm formation for example hou et al 2015 compared the structure and composition of eps extracted from anammox sludge with that of activated nitrifying and denitrifying sludge they reported that large amounts of hydrophobic amino acids and a high level of loose pn structure that exposed inner hydrophobic groups of pn in eps significantly contributed to the hydrophobic interactions and the high aggregation ability of anammox granular sludge high concentrations of pn hydrophobic groups were also found in stratified tightly bound eps tb eps where they are thought to promote anammox bacteria aggregation jia et al 2017 ali et al 2018 also found that the presence of more hydrophobic cell surface and fewer hydrophilic functional groups in the eps of ca brocadia sinica than in those of ca jettenia caeni and ca brocadia sapporoensis cause its superior aggregation ability extracellular pn from initial colonizers mature biofilms and detached biofilms in anammox based membrane bioreactors were recently investigated using quantitative proteomics chen et al 2019 it was found that protein metal ion interactions and protein induced hydrophobic interactions can contribute to the formation of biofilms glycoproteins a newly observed component of eps were also found to constitute a large fraction of anammox bacteria eps and hypothesized to play an important role in the structuring of anammox granules boleij et al 2018 although many efforts have been made to investigate the role of eps in anammox bacteria aggregation previous researches focused on whether the difference between anammox bacteria eps and those of other microbial communities hou et al 2015 or solely on the properties of eps chen et al 2019 jia et al 2017 the adhesion properties of anammox bacteria with or without eps were ignored more importantly the eps extraction methods used did not preserve the spatial structure of eps which must be investigated in situ biofilm formation is a complicated microbial self immobilization process that depends on the interaction of microbes with other microbes biotic surfaces and with inert particulates abiotic surfaces such as carrier surfaces silts and nuclei adav et al 2008 sarma et al 2017 the extended dlvo theory was used to distinguish various repulsion and attraction forces between microbes hou et al 2015 liu et al 2010 but the adhesion of microbes to abiotic surfaces was not considered in their studies further study is required to elucidate how the eps contribute to the adhesion of anammox bacteria to biotic and abiotic surfaces separately eps are generally categorized as soluble eps s eps and bound eps sheng et al 2010 bound eps are further classified into loosely bound eps lb eps in the outer layer and tb eps in the inner layer the spatial distributions and physical and chemical characteristics of the three stratified eps sub fractions are different jia et al 2017 as are their functions of structural maintenance jia et al 2017 flocculation zhang et al 2014 and settling li and yang 2007 therefore the roles of the different sub fractions of eps s eps lb eps tb eps were investigated separately in this study the stratified eps of anammox microorganisms have already been reported jia et al 2017 to study the factors for the anammox aggregation property the objective of this study was to identify the exact role of stratified eps in the initial adhesion of anammox consortia several different methods were used to analyze the compositions major functional groups and protein secondary structures of stratified annamox granules s eps lb eps and tb eps the contributions of each stratified eps subfraction to the aggregation of anammox consortia biotic surfaces and to the adhesion of anammox consortia to abiotic surfaces were studied using aggregation assays and a novel quartz crystal microbalance technique with dissipation monitoring qcm d respectively the adhesion properties of the three stratified eps subfractions were also analyzed using the novel qcm d technique the underlying mechanism of stratified eps on the initial formation of anammox biofilms is also discussed these insights are expected to aid in the cultivation of anammox biofilms and the full scale employment of anammox biofilm processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 anammox sludge the anammox granular sludge used in this study was collected from a parent anammox reactor that has been operating stably for more than three years in our laboratory ma et al 2016 fig s1 the anammox granular sludge was enriched with synthetic wastewater in a laboratory scale sequencing batch reactor with a working volume of 20 l fig s2 the composition of the synthetic wastewater was described in a previous study ma et al 2016 the volatile suspended solid concentration in the mixed liquid was approximately 5 g l and the nitrogen removal rate was 0 99 0 01 kg n m 3 d fluorescence in situ hybridization showed that ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis 81 9 was the dominant anammox species fig s3 16s rdna high throughput sequencing showed that the relative abundance of ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis was 16 8 1 2 fig s4 2 2 eps extraction the three sub fractions of eps s eps lb eps and tb eps were extracted using a modified heat method li and yang 2007 in each case anammox granules were harvested during the initial idling phase four ml of anammox granular sludge were collected and placed in a 10 ml centrifuge tube the collected sludge was first washed 3 times with 1 pbs to remove flocs and residual substrates the sludge was then gently ground and ultrasonicated at 50 w for 15 min 3 s ultrasound 7 s interval in an ice bath to disperse the anammox bacteria inside the anammox granules after ultrasonication the sludge was again washed three times with 1 pbs and centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 1 min the supernatant was discarded and the left sludge pellet i was mixed with a 0 05 nacl solution and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 5 min the supernatant was filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane and collected as s eps a 0 05 nacl solution pre heated to 60 c was added to the leftover sludge pellet ii and the mixture was vortexed for 2 min and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min the supernatant was again filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane and collected as lb eps the leftover sludge pellet iii was then resuspended in a 0 05 nacl solution and heated in a water bath at 60 c for 30 min the suspension was once again vortexed for 2 min and then centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 15 min the supernatant was filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane and collected as tb eps the leftover sludge pellet was labelled as pellet iv 2 3 sludge sample collection some of the sludge pellets i ii iii and iv were taken out during eps extraction procedure and resuspended in a 0 9 nacl solution and ultrasonicated at 20 w for 1 min 1 s ultrasound 9 s interval in an ice bath to disperse the anammox bacteria the mixture was then left to stand for 3 min to allow small microaggregates to settle the upper bacterial suspensions of the sludge pellets i ii iii and iv were collected and labelled as sludge i ii iii and iv respectively sludge i was the sludge sample collected before eps extraction sludge ii was the sludge sample after s eps extraction sludge iii was the sludge sample after lb eps extraction and sludge iv was collected after tb eps extraction 2 4 analytical methods for eps 2 4 1 chemical composition of eps the contents of pn polysaccharides ps and humic acids ha in the extracted eps were analyzed using the procedures described by bo et al 1996 pn and ha were measured using a modified lowry method with bovine serum albumin bsa and ha as standards respectively ps were analyzed using the anthrone method with glucose as a standard bo et al 1996 as pn ps and ha were the three most abundant contents of eps the total eps concentration was defined as the sum of the three contents 2 4 2 three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem fluorescence spectra of eps 3 d eem fluorescence spectra were measured using a fluoromax 4 spectrophotometer horiba japan the three eps samples with no dilution were scanned over excitation wavelengths from 245 to 400 nm at 5 nm sampling intervals and emission spectra were collected every 5 nm from 300 to 550 nm both the excitation and emission slit bandwidths were set at 5 nm the eem spectra were conducted in duplicate 2 4 3 fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir and protein secondary structure analysis the extracted eps solutions were first kept at 80 c for 24 h the frozen eps samples were then dried in a vacuum drier for 48 h by this time the samples had dried completely and turned into powders the dried eps powder was then mixed in a ratio of 1 100 with kbr in an agate grinder this mixture was compressed and measured with an ftir spectrometer nicolet 5700 usa between 4000 and 400 cm 1 to analyze the major functional groups in the eps ftir spectra between 1700 and 1600 cm 1 the amide i region were deconvoluted with a deconvolution factor of 1 5 and a deconvolution noise reduction of 0 5 using fourier self deconvolution the protein secondary structures were analyzed by calculating the second derivative spectra and fitted curves using peakfit software version 4 12 yin et al 2015 2 5 aggregation assay analysis of adhesion among anammox consortia biotic surfaces the role of stratified eps subfractions in the adhesion of anammox consortia was analyzed using aggregation assays aggregation assays were first described and used by eboigbodin and biggs 2008 briefly the initial optical density values od0 of the sludge samples suspended in a 0 9 nacl solution were adjusted to 0 6 and 3 ml of the cell suspensions were placed in cuvettes as the anammox consortia aggregated they settled to the bottom of the cuvette and the odt in the upper part of the cuvette was measured after 0 17 10 min 0 5 1 2 3 4 and 5 h the aggregation percentage at of the anammox consortia was calculated according to the following equation 1 a g g r e g a t i o n p e r c e n t a g e a t o d 0 o d t o d 0 100 the aggregation process was regarded as a reversible chemical reaction and the data were fitted to a pseudo first order rate equation as suggested by zhang et al 2014 2 a t a e 1 e kt where at is the aggregation percentage at a certain time ae is the fitted maximum aggregation percentage at equilibrium and k h 1 is the fitted pseudo first order rate constant 2 6 analysis of adhesion of anammox consortia to abiotic surfaces using qcm d the adherence and adsorption properties of both the extracted stratified eps subfractions and anammox sludge samples on abiotic surfaces were analyzed using the qcm d technique q sense analyzer sweden with gold coated sensor chips to mimic the abiotic surface before the experiment the dissolved organic carbon doc of the s eps lb eps and tb eps solutions were diluted to 20 mg l with a 0 05 nacl solution while the od600 of sludges i ii iii and iv were adjusted to 0 1 using a 0 9 nacl solution the flow rate was set at 0 1 ml min using a peristaltic pump prior to each of the qcm d experiments a 0 05 or 0 9 nacl solution background solution was initially injected into qcm d to measure the baseline 10 20 min the diluted eps solutions or sludge solutions were then injected into the qcm d analyzer the decrease in frequency δf hz and increase in dissipation energy δd were recorded automatically for six overtones 3 5 7 9 11 and 13 an analysis of representative results from the third overtone is presented in the results and discussion section after each experiment the gold coated chip was replaced with a new one for the next experiment 2 7 measurement of other indicators ph was measured using a ph probe wtw sentix41 germany the fraction of viable bacteria in the anammox sludge sample was detected using a live dead bacterial viability kit invitrogen china zeta potential was analyzed with a zetasizer malvern zetasizer nano zs 90 uk contact angle with water was measured using a contact angle analyzer dataphysics germany doc was analyzed by a total organic carbon analyzer toc l japan 3 results and discussion 3 1 chemical composition of stratified anammox granular eps subfractions the concentrations of the main components of anammox granular eps including pn ps and ha are shown in fig 1 a tb eps was the primary eps subfraction and the content was mainly pn tb eps constituted 67 5 of the total eps with s eps and lb eps making up 3 0 6 and 30 5 of the total eps respectively the total concentration and the individual concentrations of pn ps and ha increased significantly from s eps to lb eps and from lb eps to tb eps p 0 05 fig 1a pn ps and ha occurred mainly in the tb eps fraction with percentages of 64 5 82 3 and 70 8 of the total pn ps and ha concentration of eps respectively as found in previous studies jia et al 2017 wu et al 2019 yin et al 2015 pn was the predominant component in all the three eps subfractions with percentages of 65 17 82 5 and 68 2 of the total eps in s eps lb eps and tb eps respectively the amount of ha was comparable to that of ps in all the three eps subfractions indicating that ha is an important constituent of anammox granular eps jia et al 2017 previous studies reported that the pn ps ratio was related to anammox granule strength the higher the pn ps ratio the lower the strength of the granular sludge tang et al 2011 xu et al 2018 in this study the pn ps ratio in lb eps was 12 9 3 8 higher than that in s eps 5 7 5 4 and in tb eps 3 9 0 6 p 0 058 suggesting that pn makes a spatially different contribution to anammox granule strength lb eps seemed to have the most negative effect on anammox granule strength but further investigation is necessary to confirm this the high pn ps value of anammox granular total eps 3 4 12 1 has also been reported recently feng et al 2019 lotti et al 2019 3d eem fluorescence is a sensitive nondestructive detection method that requires very small samples sheng et al 2010 the 3d eem fluorescence spectra of s eps lb eps and tb eps were analyzed separately as shown in figs 1b d only one characteristic peak was present in the 3d eem fluorescence spectra of the stratified eps subfractions the peak occurred at the ex em wavelengths of 275 280 350 365 nm and was attributed to tryptophan like pn zhang et al 2011 the peak intensity increased in the order of s eps lb eps tb eps 11489 146527 and 427007 respectively suggesting that the concentration of fluorescent pn content was increased in this order these results are in agreement with the pn content analysis discussed earlier in this section fig 1a there was some difference in the emission peaks of the subfractions the wavelengths were 365 350 and 360 nm for s eps lb eps and tb eps respectively indicating that the different eps subfractions had different fluorescent components zhang et al 2014 the pn ps and ha compositions and the 3d eem fluorescence spectra showed that tb eps was the most abundant eps subfraction we therefore hypothesized that the quantity of functional groups such as hydroxyl carboxylic sulfhydryl quinonyl and phosphate groups more et al 2014 might also be the highest in tb eps which was proved later by the ftir results the high concentration of functional groups strongly affects the microbial surface properties including surface charge sorption properties and hydrophobicity sheng et al 2010 providing more binding sites and stimulating the adhesion of anammox consortia 3 2 characterization of stratified anammox granular eps subfractions by ftir 3 2 1 chemical structure of stratified eps subfractions ftir analysis of the different eps subfractions was conducted in the region of 4000 400 cm 1 to identify the functional groups present in biomolecules such as pn ps lipids and nucleic acids sheng et al 2010 fig 2 a demonstrates that the three stratified eps subfractions had similar distributions of peak positions but the transmittance rate of stratified eps subfractions followed the sequence s eps lb eps tb eps the strongest peak at 3422 3442 cm 1 was caused by n h and o h hydroxyl group stretching vibrations in pn and ps molecules wu et al 2019 the second strongest peak 1645 cm 1 was associated with the co and cc stretching vibration in pn hou et al 2015 zhu et al 2012 the double peak at 1055 1057 cm 1 and 1106 1115 cm 1 represented c h and c o c ring vibrations in ps respectively hou et al 2015 the peak at 2922 2962 cm 1 was associated with c h stretching vibrations hou et al 2015 the peak was red shifted from 2922 to 2923 cm 1 in s eps and lb eps respectively to 2962 cm 1 in tb eps implying an increase in the number of c h bonds in tb eps wu et al 2019 the band at 1542 cm 1 was associated with the stretching vibration of c n and the deformation vibration of n h in pn wu et al 2019 the band at 1500 1300 cm 1 reflected the presence of compounds containing carboxylic groups and hydrocarbon like compounds wang et al 2017 the peak at 1456 cm 1 was due to the presence of aliphatic c h ch3 and ch2 zhu et al 2012 the band at 1421 1396 cm 1 was caused by the symmetric stretching vibration of coo reflecting the acidic nature of the eps fractions zhu et al 2012 the peak at 1266 1265 cm 1 was associated with the deformation vibration of co in carboxylic acids the peaks in the fingerprint region 1000 cm 1 were due to the present of phosphate groups or nucleic acid groups wu et al 2019 the similarity of the spectra and distributions of peak positions of the three stratified eps subfractions indicated that they contained similar characteristic functional groups but the biomolecules of the three stratified eps subfractions could not be identified as the anammox granules were cultured with synthetic wastewater for this study there were almost no organic substances in the synthetic wastewater therefore the adsorption of organic matter to form eps was negligible and the eps were mostly secreted by the anammox consortia themselves which accounts for the spectra of the subfractions being similar however the transmittance rates of the three stratified eps subfractions were different with s eps lb eps tb eps indicating that the relative quantities of functional groups in the subfractions was s eps lb eps tb eps hou et al 2015 wang et al 2017 this result was in accordance with the concentrations of stratified eps shown in fig 1a 3 2 2 protein secondary structure of stratified anammox granular eps subfractions previous researches have shown that protein secondary structures strongly influence microbial aggregation adsorption and biofilm formation yin et al 2015 the ftir spectra in the range 1700 1600 cm 1 the amide i region of pn were therefore analyzed to elucidate the differences in protein secondary structures using second derivative analysis and a curve fitting procedure the fitted curves are shown in figs 2b d and the relative concentrations of four protein secondary structures α helix β sheet β turn and random coil are listed in table 1 lb eps had the most compact protein structure specifically s eps and lb eps had similar protein secondary structures and the proportions of the four protein secondary structures were numerically close while tb eps had less α helix and β sheet 23 3 6 2 and 42 5 9 3 respectively but more random coil in fact random coil was only found in tb eps with a percentage of 9 5 13 4 table 1 the α helix β sheet random coil ratio was used as an indicator for protein structure and a lower value suggests a looser protein structure hou et al 2015 by this measure pn in lb eps had the most compact structure with the highest α helix β sheet random coil value of 0 63 0 35 while pn in s eps and tb eps had a looser structure with similar values of 0 45 0 12 and 0 45 0 16 respectively table 1 however the difference in α helix β sheet random coil value among these three stratified eps subfractions was not significant p 0 69 0 05 indicating that the protein secondary structures of the three stratified eps subfractions were similar this is once again explained by the fact that the eps were mostly secreted by anammox consortia themselves these findings are in agreement with the ftir results it is also worth noting that the α helix β sheet random coil value seemed to be positively correlated with pn ps fig 1a and table 1 protein secondary structure is mostly maintained by hydrogen bonds andersen et al 2001 it was found that the increase of hydroxyl groups in titanium dioxide surface could affected the adsorption conformation of protein molecules hu et al 2019 therefore we speculate that the high amount of hydroxyl groups in ps disrupts the hydrogen bonding in pn causing a loose protein secondary structure a lower pn ps in s eps and tb eps meant a relative higher concentration of hydroxyl groups which disrupted the hydrogen bonding in pn and resulted in the relatively loose structure of pn in s eps and tb eps the aggregation ability of bacteria cells is closely related to the protein secondary structure hou et al 2015 yin et al 2015 a loose protein structure is thought to expose more inner functional groups binding sites hou et al 2015 which will bind tightly to each other to form a compact structure thus the difference in α helix β sheet random coil value indicates the difference in adhesion ability of the three stratified eps subfractions this is discussed further in section 3 4 1 in this study heating method was used to stratified extraction of s eps lb eps and tb eps heating at 60 c for 30 min during tb eps extraction was the harshest procedure up to a temperature of approximately 60 c was observed no effect on the structure of bsa chodankar et al 2008 in a recent study bsa was also used as a representative of extracellular pn to study the influence of eps extraction methods on the secondary structure of extracellular pn xiao et al 2019 heating was found to be the third best eps extraction method to obtain similar protein secondary structures with untreated bsa however the temperature used in their study was 80 c higher than 60 c in this study therefore the protein secondary structure in our study could be maximally preserved heating method was also used by yin et al 2015 when studying the secondary structure of extracellular pn we assumed that the spatial structure of other extracellular biomacromolecules was also maintain after stratified eps extraction and the obtain aggregation and adhesion results following would be consistent with others when using different eps extraction methods that could maintain the eps structure 3 3 contribution of stratified eps to anammox consortia aggregation biotic surface bacterial aggregation reactions can be divided into two categories coaggregation between different species and auto aggregation of the same species jiang et al 2006 in this study the coaggregation of anammox bacteria and other microbes was studied using aggregation assays because cultures consisting exclusively of anammox bacteria have yet to be developed the aggregation of anammox consortia is associated with the initiation formation of anammox microaggregates which is the basis for the anammox biofilm formation this reaction is governed by the surface properties of the consortia resulting from the ionic groups on the cell surfaces eboigbodin et al 2007 van der waals forces electrostatic forces and hydrophobic interactions all have an influence on the aggregation reaction eboigbodin et al 2005 2007 3 3 1 zeta potential and contact angle of anammox consortia the zeta potentials and contact angles of anammox consortia were tested to determine the surface properties of annamox consortia before and after the extraction of stratified eps as the zeta potential of anammox consortia was negative a higher zeta potential means lower surface charges and repulsion forces as mentioned in section 2 3 sludge i was a sludge sample taken before eps extraction sludge ii was a sample taken after s eps extraction sludge iii was a sample taken after s eps and lb eps extraction and sludge iv was a sludge sample after all eps extraction fig 3 shows that both zeta potential and contact angle increase from sludge i to iv suggesting the stability of anammox consortia weakened after extraction of each of the three stratified eps subfractions the stability of anammox consortia refers to the ability of themselves to resist aggregation and maintain a uniform dispersion in solutions specifically zeta potential initially became less negative increasing from 31 9 4 0 mv of sludge i to 30 0 0 6 mv and 29 0 1 3 mv of sludge ii and iii p 0 56 respectively this indicates that the extraction of s eps and lb eps decreased the stability of the consortia further stimulating the aggregation of anammox consortia by reducing electrostatic repulsion however after tb eps extraction i e proceeding from sludge iii to sludge iv the zeta potential became more negative 33 1 2 1 mv even lower than that of sludge i 31 9 4 0 mv fig 3 this means that the extraction of tb eps increased the stability of the consortia and inhibited their aggregation but contact angle results showed that the extraction of s eps slightly decreased the consortia hydrophobicity with the contact angle decreasing from 83 3 0 2 for sludge i to 82 0 1 6 for sludge ii fig 3 p 0 15 which inhibited the aggregation of anammox consortia however the extraction of lb eps and tb eps further increased the contact angle from 82 0 1 6 for sludge ii to 83 5 4 4 and 86 2 1 9 for sludges iii and iv respectively p 0 18 which in turn increased the hydrophobicity of the consortia and stimulated their aggregation the differences in both zeta potential and contact angle before and after extraction of stratified eps were not significant p 0 05 therefore the aggregation of anammox consortia could be weakly explained by electrostatic forces and hydrophobic interactions 3 3 2 aggregation assay analysis of anammox consortia aggregation the aggregation ability of anammox consortia before and after extraction of stratified eps subfractions is shown in figs 4 and s5 the kinetic parameters of the fitted curves are listed in table 2 the aggregation results shown that the extraction of the three stratified eps subfractions stimulated the aggregation of anammox consortia the four fitted curves for sludge i ii iii and iv all show similar trends rising rapidly in the first hour and reaching equilibrium within 2 h fig 4 this meant that the aggregation ability of anammox consortia before and after the extraction of the stratified eps subfractions was quite similar most of the anammox consortia aggregated and settled to the bottom of the cuvette within the first hour although the aggregation percentage of anammox consortia still increased after 1 h but the increase degree was small surprisingly the aggregation percentage of anammox consortia at equilibrium increased after the extraction of each successive eps subfraction from 77 6 3 0 for sludge i to 81 5 2 8 84 3 3 0 and 85 2 2 6 for sludges ii iii and iv respectively table 2 p 0 0005 0 001 although there was a slight decrease from sludge ii to sludge iii the aggregation rate constant generally showed an increasing trend from 4 0 0 8 h 1 for sludge i to 4 6 0 9 4 3 0 9 and 5 2 0 9 h 1 for sludges ii iii and iv respectively table 2 p 0 71 0 05 this means that the extraction of s eps and tb eps had a positive effect on both the aggregation percentage and the aggregation rate the extraction of lb eps from sludge ii to iii slightly decreased the aggregate rate but increased the aggregation percentage the highest aggregation percentage and aggregation rate occurred in sludge iv after extraction all the three stratified eps subfractions this shows that the extraction of the three stratified eps subfractions stimulated the initial aggregation of anammox consortia the living cell ratio was also tested before and after the extraction of the stratified eps subfractions table 2 there was no significant difference p 1 00 0 05 in the four sludge samples indicating the validity of the aggregation results both zeta potential and contact angle analysis showed that the extraction of stratified eps subfractions reduced the surface charge and increased the hydrophobicity of the consortia the exceptions were that the extraction of s eps reduced the hydrophobicity of the consortia and the extraction of tb eps increased the surface charge fig 3 combined electrostatic forces and hydrophobic interactions both of which first decreased and then increased promoted the aggregation of the anammox consortia after the extraction of each eps subfraction more importantly as noted in sections 3 1 and 3 2 1 the amounts of pn ps ha and the major functional groups increased from s eps to lb eps and from lb eps to tb eps figs 1a and 2a the interactions between these groups such as hydrogen bonding intensified leading to an increase in the aggregation percentage and rate after s eps and lb eps extraction hydrogen bonding has already been proposed as the predominant trigger for sludge aggregation guo et al 2016 the fact that the extraction of tb eps also increased the aggregation of anammox consortia might be the result of the expression of abundant pn acting as biological adhesives on the surface of the bacteria the conclusion that the extraction of the three stratified eps subfractions s eps lb eps and tb eps stimulated the initial aggregation of anammox consortia was unexpected the aggregation ability of anammox consortia might depend on the anammox consortia expressing adhesion molecules on the bacteria surface although lb eps and tb eps were reported to contribute to the aggregation of activated sludge and anaerobic methanogenic sludge liu et al 2010 the aggregation potential of biofilm bacteria in a sequencing batch biofilm reactor treating synthetic organic wastewater has already been ascribed to the bacteria themselves but not to the secretion of eps zhang et al 2014 the aggregation ability of e coli mg1655 is also thought to be governed by the cells themselves eboigbodin and biggs 2008 a recent synthetic bacterial cell cell adhesion toolbox hypothesizes that pn are expressed as a nanobodies or antigens on the e coli cell surface that specifically adhere to each other glass and riedel kruse 2018 the amino and carboxyl groups of the pn could stimulate aggregation reactions by promoting the formation hydrogen bonds similarly we hypothesized that the initial aggregation of planktonic anammox bacteria might also depend on the expression of complementary antigens and antibodies on the anammox bacteria surface that interact specifically or nonspecifically as adhesion molecules 3 4 contribution of stratified eps to abiotic surface adhesion of anammox consortia the role of stratified eps subfractions in adhesion of anammox consortia to abiotic surfaces was investigated using the qcm d technique qcm d is a popular non destructive technique to study the adherence and viscoelastic properties of biomolecules or bacteria on various surfaces amer et al 2011 contreras et al 2011 gold coated sensor chips were used in the experiment to mimic abiotic surfaces such as carrier surfaces silts and nuclei 3 4 1 adherence and viscoelastic properties of stratified eps subfractions the adherence and viscoelastic properties of the stratified eps subfractions on abiotic surfaces were first analyzed using eps adsorption experiments on gold coated sensor chips fig 5 prior to the experiment each stratified eps subfraction solution was diluted to 20 mg doc l lb eps was the most viscous of the stratified eps subfractions and formed the most rigid and compact adhered layer on the abiotic gold surface figs 5a and b shows that the δf and δd of the gold coated sensor chips reflected the formation of an eps adhesion layer on the surfaces of the chips the faster the decrease in δf the stronger the eps adherence amer et al 2011 lb eps had the highest adhesion rate with the fastest decrease in δf while tb eps had the lowest adhesion rate the decreased values of δf were 18 2 0 1 23 8 0 1 and 15 5 0 1 hz for s eps lb eps and tb eps respectively fig 5a p 0 001 the decrease in δf is positively correlated to the adsorbed mass jenia et al 2013 therefore the adsorbed mass was also the highest in lb eps and the lowest in tb eps in accord with the adhesion rate surprisingly this tendency was in good agreement with the pn ps and the α helix β sheet random coil value table 1 as mentioned in section 3 2 2 lb eps had the most compact secondary structure with the hydrophobic functional groups wrapped inside the structure therefore lb eps molecules that attached to the sensor chips were less likely to be adhered and washed away by other lb eps molecules in solution this explains the stronger adhesion of lb eps δd reflects the viscoelastic properties of the adhered biomolecules layer δd and δf are plotted together in fig 5c the slope of δd over δ is the induced energy dissipation per coupled unit mass the greater the absolute value of the slope the more viscous and loose the adhered biomolecules layer contreras et al 2011 leino et al 2011 biomolecules of lb eps formed the most rigid and compact adhered layer while biomolecules of tb eps formed the most thick and loose adhered layer on sensor chips the zeta potentials of the eps solutions were also tested fig s6 the zeta potential decreased successively from s eps to lb eps to tb eps indicating increasing stability compared with the zeta potential the adhesion of biomolecules on abiotic surfaces was more closely related to the structure of the biomolecules figs 5a c and table 1 a more compact structure exposes fewer functional groups and binding sites to the solution thus making the adhered biomolecules less likely to be adhere to and washed away by other biomolecules in the solution 3 4 2 adherence and viscoelastic properties of anammox consortia on abiotic surfaces the qcm d technique was also used to study the adherence and viscoelastic properties of anammox consortia with and without eps subfractions on abiotic surfaces as shown in figs 5d and e sludge i before extraction had the highest decrease rate of δf indicating that sludge i adhered more easily to the surfaces of the gold coated chips sludge iv had the lowest rate of decrease of δf while sludges ii and iii had decrease rates of δf between those of sludges i and iv the decreased values of δf were 15 2 0 1 11 2 0 1 9 2 0 1 and 10 5 0 1 hz for sludges i ii iii and iv respectively p 0 001 these results suggest that the secretion of tb eps increased the adhesion rate of anammox consortia while the secretion of lb eps and s eps increased both the adhesion rate and the adhered mass the most flat and rigid adsorbed layer was also found in sludge i before eps extraction fig 5f with the lowest δd δf slope of 0 0496 0 0004 note that all the three sludge samples with eps sludges i ii and iii had higher rates of decrease of δf and lower δd δf slopes compared with the sludge sample without eps sludge iv this illustrates the vital role played by all the three stratified eps subfractions in the adhesion of anammox consortia to abiotic surfaces and the formation of compact adhesion structures the adhesion of anammox consortia to inert particulates mimicked by gold coated chips was inhibited by the extraction of eps subfractions this behavior was exactly the opposite of the trend observed in the aggregation behavior of the anammox consortia the order of importance of the eps subfractions in adhesion to abiotic surfaces was s eps lb eps tb eps analogously to the eps adhesion results in section 3 4 1 the adhesion of eps biomolecules on the abiotic surface was influenced by the adhesion of adhered eps biomolecules the stronger the adhesion to eps biomolecules in the solution the lower the adsorption rate in this regard the experimental results on the adhesion of anammox consortia to abiotic surface were in accord with the aggregation behavior fig 4 and table 2 sludge iv aggregated more easily with other bacteria in solution and thus had a slower adhesion rate to the abiotic surface while sludge i aggregated less and thus adhered more quickly to the abiotic surface 3 5 proposed role of stratified eps in the initial anammox biofilm formation from planktonic bacteria to mature biofilms the initial adhesion of bacteria to other bacteria or to inert particulates is inevitable lin and wang 2017 liu and tay 2004 the microaggregates thus generated serve as precursors to the formation of biofilms it has been hypothesized in previous researches on granulation processes that the secretion of eps which acts as a biological glue is the next step in the formation of microaggregates adav et al 2008 sarma et al 2017 anammox biofilm formation also proceeds by the initial adhesion of anammox bacteria to bacteria and inert particulates based on the adhesion results of both aggregation assays and qcm d figs 4 and 5 we suggest that the initial aggregation of anammox bacteria occurs because of the expression of adhesion molecules on the surfaces of the bacteria with no contribution from eps fig 6 the expression of adhesion molecules stimulates the aggregation of anammox bacteria and the secretion of the three stratified eps begins only after the initial aggregation of small numbers of anammox bacteria this results in the formation of a compact anammox bacteria cluster fig 5 the adhesion of inert particulates such as carrier surfaces silts and saline precipitates is also stimulated by the secreted eps fig 5 finally anammox bacteria clusters filamentous bacteria other planktonic bacteria and inert particulates co adhere forming either a compact adhesion layer as a precursor to anammox biofilm formation or forming compact microaggregates as precursors to anammox granule formation this hypothesis on the initial aggregation of anammox consortia can explain the phenomena that the addition of calcium or magnesium ions saline precipitates graaff et al 2011 zeolites fernández et al 2008 and inactive methanogenic granules ni et al 2010 accelerate the formation of anammox biofilms the artificial dosing of inert particulates as nuclei to accelerate anammox biofilms formation can be used for engineering applications this can also lead to a compact biofilm structure which is important for preventing biofilm breakage 4 conclusions in this work the eps of anammox granules stratified as s eps lb eps and tb eps were separately extracted and characterized to elucidate their influence on anammox consortia surface properties the role of stratified eps of anammox granules in the initial anammox consortia aggregation was clarified using aggregation assays before and after the extraction of each stratified eps subfraction the adherence to abiotic surfaces and the viscoelastic properties of both stratified eps subfractions and anammox consortia with and without each stratified eps subfraction were systematically investigated using the novel qcm d technique understanding these roles of stratified eps subfraction will aid in the cultivation of anammox biofilms and maintaining the stability of anammox biofilm based processes the main outcomes were as follows tb eps were the most abundant eps subfractions and pn were the primary eps constituents of anammox granules the major functional groups were quite similar in the three eps subfractions but the concentrations of the functional groups followed the order s eps lb eps tb eps lb eps had the most compact protein secondary structure the aggregation of anammox bacteria was mostly controlled by interactions such as hydrogen bonding between functional groups the extraction of each of the three eps subfractions stimulated the aggregation of anammox consortia the adhesion of anammox consortia to abiotic surfaces was inhibited by the extraction of eps subfractions the order of importance of the contributions of the eps subfractions to adhesion to abiotic surfaces was s eps lb eps tb eps the ability of anammox consortia to aggregate is due to the bacteria themselves rather than to eps the expression of adhesion molecules on the surfaces of the bacteria plays an important role in the aggregation process while the stratified eps subfractions stimulate the adhesion of inert particulates

18352,anammox bacteria tend to self aggregate and biofilm based anammox processes are widely used as sustainable alternative methods for nitrogen removal from wastewater however the mechanism for the initial adhesion of anammox bacteria remains unclear in this work extracellular polymeric substances eps were extracted separately from anammox granules and then characterized by multi methods the adhesion properties of anammox consortia to biotic and abiotic surfaces were examined separately before and after the extraction of three stratified eps using aggregation assays and a quartz crystal microbalance technique with dissipation monitoring respectively the extraction of each of the three stratified eps gradually increased the initial aggregation of anammox consortia from 77 6 3 0 to 85 2 2 6 fourier transform infrared spectrometry confirmed that the aggregation of anammox consortia depended largely on the interactions between functional groups on the cell surfaces all three stratified eps had positive effects on the initial adhesion rate and mass of anammox consortia to abiotic surfaces more importantly the structure of the adhered layer was more compact before the extraction of each of the three stratified eps we therefore hypothesized that the initial adhesion among anammox consortia was due to the ability of the anammox bacteria to express adhesion molecules on the bacterial surfaces and that the three stratified eps were excreted to adhere inert particulates and form a compact biofilm structure this study clarifies the role of stratified eps on the initial formation of anammox biofilms and provides a theoretical basis for accelerating the formation of anammox biofilms graphical abstract image 1 keywords anammox biofilm extracellular polymeric

have spurred great efforts to accelerate the formation of anammox biofilms fernández et al 2008 graaff et al 2011 ni et al 2010 biofilm based anammox processes have already been extensively used in full scale wastewater treatment plants around the world lackner et al 2014 however the inherent mechanism for initial anammox bacteria aggregation remains unclear sticky extracellular polymeric substances eps released by bacteria play a crucial role in the process of sludge aggregation hou et al 2015 peeters and van niftrik 2019 eps are hypothesized to bridge bacteria with other bacteria or inert particulates such as carrier surfaces silts and nuclei into an aggregate thus facilitating the formation of biofilms adav et al 2008 liu and tay 2004 as a predominant component of anammox sludge feng et al 2019 lotti et al 2019 proteins pn seem to be the most important factor in anammox biofilm formation for example hou et al 2015 compared the structure and composition of eps extracted from anammox sludge with that of activated nitrifying and denitrifying sludge they reported that large amounts of hydrophobic amino acids and a high level of loose pn structure that exposed inner hydrophobic groups of pn in eps significantly contributed to the hydrophobic interactions and the high aggregation ability of anammox granular sludge high concentrations of pn hydrophobic groups were also found in stratified tightly bound eps tb eps where they are thought to promote anammox bacteria aggregation jia et al 2017 ali et al 2018 also found that the presence of more hydrophobic cell surface and fewer hydrophilic functional groups in the eps of ca brocadia sinica than in those of ca jettenia caeni and ca brocadia sapporoensis cause its superior aggregation ability extracellular pn from initial colonizers mature biofilms and detached biofilms in anammox based membrane bioreactors were recently investigated using quantitative proteomics chen et al 2019 it was found that protein metal ion interactions and protein induced hydrophobic interactions can contribute to the formation of biofilms glycoproteins a newly observed component of eps were also found to constitute a large fraction of anammox bacteria eps and hypothesized to play an important role in the structuring of anammox granules boleij et al 2018 although many efforts have been made to investigate the role of eps in anammox bacteria aggregation previous researches focused on whether the difference between anammox bacteria eps and those of other microbial communities hou et al 2015 or solely on the properties of eps chen et al 2019 jia et al 2017 the adhesion properties of anammox bacteria with or without eps were ignored more importantly the eps extraction methods used did not preserve the spatial structure of eps which must be investigated in situ biofilm formation is a complicated microbial self immobilization process that depends on the interaction of microbes with other microbes biotic surfaces and with inert particulates abiotic surfaces such as carrier surfaces silts and nuclei adav et al 2008 sarma et al 2017 the extended dlvo theory was used to distinguish various repulsion and attraction forces between microbes hou et al 2015 liu et al 2010 but the adhesion of microbes to abiotic surfaces was not considered in their studies further study is required to elucidate how the eps contribute to the adhesion of anammox bacteria to biotic and abiotic surfaces separately eps are generally categorized as soluble eps s eps and bound eps sheng et al 2010 bound eps are further classified into loosely bound eps lb eps in the outer layer and tb eps in the inner layer the spatial distributions and physical and chemical characteristics of the three stratified eps sub fractions are different jia et al 2017 as are their functions of structural maintenance jia et al 2017 flocculation zhang et al 2014 and settling li and yang 2007 therefore the roles of the different sub fractions of eps s eps lb eps tb eps were investigated separately in this study the stratified eps of anammox microorganisms have already been reported jia et al 2017 to study the factors for the anammox aggregation property the objective of this study was to identify the exact role of stratified eps in the initial adhesion of anammox consortia several different methods were used to analyze the compositions major functional groups and protein secondary structures of stratified annamox granules s eps lb eps and tb eps the contributions of each stratified eps subfraction to the aggregation of anammox consortia biotic surfaces and to the adhesion of anammox consortia to abiotic surfaces were studied using aggregation assays and a novel quartz crystal microbalance technique with dissipation monitoring qcm d respectively the adhesion properties of the three stratified eps subfractions were also analyzed using the novel qcm d technique the underlying mechanism of stratified eps on the initial formation of anammox biofilms is also discussed these insights are expected to aid in the cultivation of anammox biofilms and the full scale employment of anammox biofilm processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 anammox sludge the anammox granular sludge used in this study was collected from a parent anammox reactor that has been operating stably for more than three years in our laboratory ma et al 2016 fig s1 the anammox granular sludge was enriched with synthetic wastewater in a laboratory scale sequencing batch reactor with a working volume of 20 l fig s2 the composition of the synthetic wastewater was described in a previous study ma et al 2016 the volatile suspended solid concentration in the mixed liquid was approximately 5 g l and the nitrogen removal rate was 0 99 0 01 kg n m 3 d fluorescence in situ hybridization showed that ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis 81 9 was the dominant anammox species fig s3 16s rdna high throughput sequencing showed that the relative abundance of ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis was 16 8 1 2 fig s4 2 2 eps extraction the three sub fractions of eps s eps lb eps and tb eps were extracted using a modified heat method li and yang 2007 in each case anammox granules were harvested during the initial idling phase four ml of anammox granular sludge were collected and placed in a 10 ml centrifuge tube the collected sludge was first washed 3 times with 1 pbs to remove flocs and residual substrates the sludge was then gently ground and ultrasonicated at 50 w for 15 min 3 s ultrasound 7 s interval in an ice bath to disperse the anammox bacteria inside the anammox granules after ultrasonication the sludge was again washed three times with 1 pbs and centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 1 min the supernatant was discarded and the left sludge pellet i was mixed with a 0 05 nacl solution and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 5 min the supernatant was filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane and collected as s eps a 0 05 nacl solution pre heated to 60 c was added to the leftover sludge pellet ii and the mixture was vortexed for 2 min and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min the supernatant was again filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane and collected as lb eps the leftover sludge pellet iii was then resuspended in a 0 05 nacl solution and heated in a water bath at 60 c for 30 min the suspension was once again vortexed for 2 min and then centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 15 min the supernatant was filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane and collected as tb eps the leftover sludge pellet was labelled as pellet iv 2 3 sludge sample collection some of the sludge pellets i ii iii and iv were taken out during eps extraction procedure and resuspended in a 0 9 nacl solution and ultrasonicated at 20 w for 1 min 1 s ultrasound 9 s interval in an ice bath to disperse the anammox bacteria the mixture was then left to stand for 3 min to allow small microaggregates to settle the upper bacterial suspensions of the sludge pellets i ii iii and iv were collected and labelled as sludge i ii iii and iv respectively sludge i was the sludge sample collected before eps extraction sludge ii was the sludge sample after s eps extraction sludge iii was the sludge sample after lb eps extraction and sludge iv was collected after tb eps extraction 2 4 analytical methods for eps 2 4 1 chemical composition of eps the contents of pn polysaccharides ps and humic acids ha in the extracted eps were analyzed using the procedures described by bo et al 1996 pn and ha were measured using a modified lowry method with bovine serum albumin bsa and ha as standards respectively ps were analyzed using the anthrone method with glucose as a standard bo et al 1996 as pn ps and ha were the three most abundant contents of eps the total eps concentration was defined as the sum of the three contents 2 4 2 three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem fluorescence spectra of eps 3 d eem fluorescence spectra were measured using a fluoromax 4 spectrophotometer horiba japan the three eps samples with no dilution were scanned over excitation wavelengths from 245 to 400 nm at 5 nm sampling intervals and emission spectra were collected every 5 nm from 300 to 550 nm both the excitation and emission slit bandwidths were set at 5 nm the eem spectra were conducted in duplicate 2 4 3 fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir and protein secondary structure analysis the extracted eps solutions were first kept at 80 c for 24 h the frozen eps samples were then dried in a vacuum drier for 48 h by this time the samples had dried completely and turned into powders the dried eps powder was then mixed in a ratio of 1 100 with kbr in an agate grinder this mixture was compressed and measured with an ftir spectrometer nicolet 5700 usa between 4000 and 400 cm 1 to analyze the major functional groups in the eps ftir spectra between 1700 and 1600 cm 1 the amide i region were deconvoluted with a deconvolution factor of 1 5 and a deconvolution noise reduction of 0 5 using fourier self deconvolution the protein secondary structures were analyzed by calculating the second derivative spectra and fitted curves using peakfit software version 4 12 yin et al 2015 2 5 aggregation assay analysis of adhesion among anammox consortia biotic surfaces the role of stratified eps subfractions in the adhesion of anammox consortia was analyzed using aggregation assays aggregation assays were first described and used by eboigbodin and biggs 2008 briefly the initial optical density values od0 of the sludge samples suspended in a 0 9 nacl solution were adjusted to 0 6 and 3 ml of the cell suspensions were placed in cuvettes as the anammox consortia aggregated they settled to the bottom of the cuvette and the odt in the upper part of the cuvette was measured after 0 17 10 min 0 5 1 2 3 4 and 5 h the aggregation percentage at of the anammox consortia was calculated according to the following equation 1 a g g r e g a t i o n p e r c e n t a g e a t o d 0 o d t o d 0 100 the aggregation process was regarded as a reversible chemical reaction and the data were fitted to a pseudo first order rate equation as suggested by zhang et al 2014 2 a t a e 1 e kt where at is the aggregation percentage at a certain time ae is the fitted maximum aggregation percentage at equilibrium and k h 1 is the fitted pseudo first order rate constant 2 6 analysis of adhesion of anammox consortia to abiotic surfaces using qcm d the adherence and adsorption properties of both the extracted stratified eps subfractions and anammox sludge samples on abiotic surfaces were analyzed using the qcm d technique q sense analyzer sweden with gold coated sensor chips to mimic the abiotic surface before the experiment the dissolved organic carbon doc of the s eps lb eps and tb eps solutions were diluted to 20 mg l with a 0 05 nacl solution while the od600 of sludges i ii iii and iv were adjusted to 0 1 using a 0 9 nacl solution the flow rate was set at 0 1 ml min using a peristaltic pump prior to each of the qcm d experiments a 0 05 or 0 9 nacl solution background solution was initially injected into qcm d to measure the baseline 10 20 min the diluted eps solutions or sludge solutions were then injected into the qcm d analyzer the decrease in frequency δf hz and increase in dissipation energy δd were recorded automatically for six overtones 3 5 7 9 11 and 13 an analysis of representative results from the third overtone is presented in the results and discussion section after each experiment the gold coated chip was replaced with a new one for the next experiment 2 7 measurement of other indicators ph was measured using a ph probe wtw sentix41 germany the fraction of viable bacteria in the anammox sludge sample was

angle analyzer dataphysics germany doc was analyzed by a total organic carbon analyzer toc l japan 3 results and discussion 3 1 chemical composition of stratified anammox granular eps subfractions the concentrations of the main components of anammox granular eps including pn ps and ha are shown in fig 1 a tb eps was the primary eps subfraction and the content was mainly pn tb eps constituted 67 5 of the total eps with s eps and lb eps making up 3 0 6 and 30 5 of the total eps respectively the total concentration and the individual concentrations of pn ps and ha increased significantly from s eps to lb eps and from lb eps to tb eps p 0 05 fig 1a pn ps and ha occurred mainly in the tb eps fraction with percentages of 64 5 82 3 and 70 8 of the total pn ps and ha concentration of eps respectively as found in previous studies jia et al 2017 wu et al 2019 yin et al 2015 pn was the predominant component in all the three eps subfractions with percentages of 65 17 82 5 and 68 2 of the total eps in s eps lb eps and tb eps respectively the amount of ha was comparable to that of ps in all the three eps subfractions indicating that ha is an important constituent of anammox granular eps jia et al 2017 previous studies reported that the pn ps ratio was related to anammox granule strength the higher the pn ps ratio the lower the strength of the granular sludge tang et al 2011 xu et al 2018 in this study the pn ps ratio in lb eps was 12 9 3 8 higher than that in s eps 5 7 5 4 and in tb eps 3 9 0 6 p 0 058 suggesting that pn makes a spatially different contribution to anammox granule strength lb eps seemed to have the most negative effect on anammox granule strength but further investigation is necessary to confirm this the high pn ps value of anammox granular total eps 3 4 12 1 has also been reported recently feng et al 2019 lotti et al 2019 3d eem fluorescence is a sensitive nondestructive detection method that requires very small samples sheng et al 2010 the 3d eem fluorescence spectra of s eps lb eps and tb eps were analyzed separately as shown in figs 1b d only one characteristic peak was present in the 3d eem fluorescence spectra of the stratified eps subfractions the peak occurred at the ex em wavelengths of 275 280 350 365 nm and was attributed to tryptophan like pn zhang et al 2011 the peak intensity increased in the order of s eps lb eps tb eps 11489 146527 and 427007 respectively suggesting that the concentration of fluorescent pn content was increased in this order these results are in agreement with the pn content analysis discussed earlier in this section fig 1a there was some difference in the emission peaks of the subfractions the wavelengths were 365 350 and 360 nm for s eps lb eps and tb eps respectively indicating that the different eps subfractions had different fluorescent components zhang et al 2014 the pn ps and ha compositions and the 3d eem fluorescence spectra showed that tb eps was the most abundant eps subfraction we therefore hypothesized that the quantity of functional groups such as hydroxyl carboxylic sulfhydryl quinonyl and phosphate groups more et al 2014 might also be the highest in tb eps which was proved later by the ftir results the high concentration of functional groups strongly affects the microbial surface properties including surface charge sorption properties and hydrophobicity sheng et al 2010 providing more binding sites and stimulating the adhesion of anammox consortia 3 2 characterization of stratified anammox granular eps subfractions by ftir 3 2 1 chemical structure of stratified eps subfractions ftir analysis of the different eps subfractions was conducted in the region of 4000 400 cm 1 to identify the functional groups present in biomolecules such as pn ps lipids and nucleic acids sheng et al 2010 fig 2 a demonstrates that the three stratified eps subfractions had similar distributions of peak positions but the transmittance rate of stratified eps subfractions followed the sequence s eps lb eps tb eps the strongest peak at 3422 3442 cm 1 was caused by n h and o h hydroxyl group stretching vibrations in pn and ps molecules wu et al 2019 the second strongest peak 1645 cm 1 was associated with the co and cc stretching vibration in pn hou et al 2015 zhu et al 2012 the double peak at 1055 1057 cm 1 and 1106 1115 cm 1 represented c h and c o c ring vibrations in ps respectively hou et al 2015 the peak at 2922 2962 cm 1 was associated with c h stretching vibrations hou et al 2015 the peak was red shifted from 2922 to 2923 cm 1 in s eps and lb eps respectively to 2962 cm 1 in tb eps implying an increase in the number of c h bonds in tb eps wu et al 2019 the band at 1542 cm 1 was associated with the stretching vibration of c n and the deformation vibration of n h in pn wu et al 2019 the band at 1500 1300 cm 1 reflected the presence of compounds containing carboxylic groups and hydrocarbon like compounds wang et al 2017 the peak at 1456 cm 1 was due to the presence of aliphatic c h ch3 and ch2 zhu et al 2012 the band at 1421 1396 cm 1 was caused by the symmetric stretching vibration of coo reflecting the acidic nature of the eps fractions zhu et al 2012 the peak at 1266 1265 cm 1 was associated with the deformation vibration of co in carboxylic acids the peaks in the fingerprint region 1000 cm 1 were due to the present of phosphate groups or nucleic acid groups wu et al 2019 the similarity of the spectra and distributions of peak positions of the three stratified eps subfractions indicated that they contained similar characteristic functional groups but the biomolecules of the three stratified eps subfractions could not be identified as the anammox granules were cultured with synthetic wastewater for this study there were almost no organic substances in the synthetic wastewater therefore the adsorption of organic matter to form eps was negligible and the eps were mostly secreted by the anammox consortia themselves which accounts for the spectra of the subfractions being similar however the transmittance rates of the three stratified eps subfractions were different with s eps lb eps tb eps indicating that the relative quantities of functional groups in the subfractions was s eps lb eps tb eps hou et al 2015 wang et al 2017 this result was in accordance with the concentrations of stratified eps shown in fig 1a 3 2 2 protein secondary structure of stratified anammox granular eps subfractions previous researches have shown that protein secondary structures strongly influence microbial aggregation adsorption and biofilm formation yin et al 2015 the ftir spectra in the range 1700 1600 cm 1 the amide i region of pn were therefore analyzed to elucidate the differences in protein secondary structures using second derivative analysis and a curve fitting procedure the fitted curves are shown in figs 2b d and the relative concentrations of four protein secondary structures α helix β sheet β turn and random coil are listed in table 1 lb eps had the most compact protein structure specifically s eps and lb eps had similar protein secondary structures and the proportions of the four protein secondary structures were numerically close while tb eps had less α helix and β sheet 23 3 6 2 and 42 5 9 3 respectively but more random coil in fact random coil was only found in tb eps with a percentage of 9 5 13 4 table 1 the α helix β sheet random coil ratio was used as an indicator for protein structure and a lower value suggests a looser protein structure hou et al 2015 by this measure pn in lb eps had the most compact structure with the highest α helix β sheet random coil value of 0 63 0 35 while pn in s eps and tb eps had a looser structure with similar values of 0 45 0 12 and 0 45 0 16 respectively table 1 however the difference in α helix β sheet random coil value among these three stratified eps subfractions was not significant p 0 69 0 05 indicating that the protein secondary structures of the three stratified eps subfractions were similar this is once again explained by the fact that the eps were mostly secreted by anammox consortia themselves these findings are in agreement with the ftir results it is also worth noting that the α helix β sheet random coil value seemed to be positively correlated with pn ps fig 1a and table 1 protein secondary structure is mostly maintained by hydrogen bonds andersen et al 2001 it was found that the increase of hydroxyl groups in titanium dioxide surface could affected the adsorption conformation of protein molecules hu et al 2019 therefore we speculate that the high amount of hydroxyl groups in ps disrupts the hydrogen bonding in pn causing a loose protein secondary structure a lower pn ps in s eps and tb eps meant a relative higher concentration of hydroxyl groups which disrupted the hydrogen bonding in pn and resulted in the relatively loose structure of pn in s eps and tb eps the aggregation ability of bacteria cells is closely related to the protein secondary structure hou et al 2015 yin et al 2015 a loose protein structure is thought to expose more inner functional groups binding sites hou et al 2015 which will bind tightly to each other to form a compact structure thus the difference in α helix β sheet random coil value indicates the difference in adhesion ability of the three stratified eps subfractions this is discussed further in section 3 4 1 in this study heating method was used to stratified extraction of s eps lb eps and tb eps heating at 60 c for 30 min during tb eps extraction was the harshest procedure up to a temperature of approximately 60 c was observed no effect on the structure of bsa chodankar et al 2008 in a recent study bsa was also used as a representative of extracellular pn to study the influence of eps extraction methods on the secondary structure of extracellular pn xiao et al 2019 heating was found to be the third best eps extraction method to obtain similar protein secondary structures with untreated bsa however the temperature used in their study was 80 c higher than 60 c in this study therefore the protein secondary structure in our study could be maximally preserved heating method was also used by yin et al 2015 when studying the secondary structure of extracellular pn we assumed that the spatial structure of other extracellular biomacromolecules was also maintain after stratified eps extraction and the obtain aggregation and adhesion results following would be consistent with others when using different eps extraction methods that could maintain the eps structure 3 3 contribution of stratified eps to anammox consortia aggregation biotic surface bacterial aggregation reactions can be divided into two categories coaggregation between different species and auto aggregation of the same species jiang et al 2006 in this study the coaggregation of anammox bacteria and other microbes was studied using aggregation assays because cultures consisting exclusively of anammox bacteria have yet to be developed the aggregation of anammox consortia is associated with the initiation formation of anammox microaggregates which is the basis for the anammox biofilm formation this reaction is governed by the surface properties of the consortia resulting from the ionic groups on the cell surfaces eboigbodin et al 2007 van der waals forces electrostatic forces and hydrophobic interactions all have an influence on the aggregation reaction eboigbodin et al 2005 2007 3 3 1 zeta potential and contact angle of anammox consortia the zeta potentials and contact angles of anammox consortia were tested to determine the surface properties of annamox consortia before and after the extraction of stratified eps as the zeta potential of anammox consortia was negative a higher zeta potential means lower surface charges and repulsion forces as mentioned in section 2 3 sludge i was a sludge sample taken before eps extraction sludge ii was a sample taken after s eps extraction sludge iii was a sample taken after s eps and lb eps extraction and sludge iv was a sludge sample after all eps extraction fig 3 shows that both zeta potential and contact angle increase from sludge i to iv suggesting the stability of anammox consortia weakened after extraction of each of the three stratified eps subfractions the stability of anammox consortia refers to the ability of themselves to resist aggregation and maintain a uniform dispersion in solutions specifically zeta potential initially became less negative increasing from 31 9 4 0 mv of sludge i to 30 0 0 6 mv and 29 0 1 3 mv of sludge ii and iii p 0 56 respectively this indicates that the extraction of s eps and lb eps decreased the stability of the consortia further stimulating the aggregation of anammox consortia by reducing electrostatic repulsion however after tb eps extraction i e proceeding from sludge iii to sludge iv the zeta potential became more negative 33 1 2 1 mv even lower than that of sludge i 31 9 4 0 mv fig 3 this means that the extraction of tb eps increased the stability of the consortia and inhibited their aggregation but contact angle results showed that the extraction of s eps slightly decreased the consortia hydrophobicity with the contact angle decreasing from 83 3 0 2 for sludge i to 82 0 1 6 for sludge ii fig 3 p 0 15 which inhibited the aggregation of anammox consortia however the extraction of lb eps and tb eps further increased the contact angle from 82 0 1 6 for sludge ii to 83 5 4 4 and 86 2 1 9 for sludges iii and iv respectively p 0 18 which in turn increased the hydrophobicity of the consortia and stimulated their aggregation the differences in both zeta potential and contact angle before and after extraction of stratified eps were not significant p 0 05 therefore the aggregation of anammox consortia could be weakly explained by electrostatic forces and hydrophobic interactions 3 3 2 aggregation assay analysis of anammox consortia aggregation the aggregation ability of anammox consortia before and after extraction of stratified eps subfractions is shown in figs 4 and s5 the kinetic parameters of the fitted curves are listed in table 2 the aggregation results shown that the extraction of the three stratified eps subfractions stimulated the aggregation of anammox consortia the four fitted curves for sludge i ii iii and iv all show similar trends rising rapidly in the first hour and reaching equilibrium within 2 h fig 4 this meant that the aggregation ability of anammox consortia before and after the extraction of the stratified eps subfractions was quite similar most of the anammox consortia aggregated and settled to the bottom of the cuvette within the first hour although the aggregation percentage of anammox consortia still increased after 1 h but the increase degree was small surprisingly the aggregation percentage of anammox consortia at equilibrium increased after the extraction of each successive eps subfraction from 77 6 3 0 for sludge i to 81 5 2 8 84 3 3 0 and 85 2 2 6 for sludges ii iii and iv respectively table 2 p 0 0005 0 001 although there was a slight decrease from sludge ii to sludge iii the aggregation rate constant generally showed an increasing trend from 4 0 0 8 h 1 for sludge i to 4 6 0 9 4 3 0 9 and 5 2 0 9 h 1 for sludges ii iii and iv respectively table 2 p 0 71 0 05 this means that the extraction of s eps and tb eps had a positive effect on both the aggregation percentage and the aggregation rate the extraction of lb eps from sludge ii to iii slightly decreased the aggregate rate but increased the aggregation percentage the highest aggregation percentage and aggregation rate occurred in sludge iv after extraction all the three stratified eps subfractions this shows that the extraction of the three stratified eps subfractions stimulated the initial aggregation of anammox consortia the living cell ratio was also tested before and after the extraction of the stratified eps subfractions table 2 there was no significant difference p 1 00 0 05 in the four sludge samples indicating the validity of the aggregation results both zeta potential and contact angle analysis showed that the extraction of stratified eps subfractions reduced the surface charge and increased the hydrophobicity of the consortia the exceptions were that the extraction of s eps reduced the hydrophobicity of the consortia and the extraction of tb eps increased the surface charge fig 3 combined electrostatic forces and hydrophobic interactions both of which first decreased and then increased promoted the aggregation of the anammox consortia after the extraction of each eps subfraction more importantly as noted in sections 3 1 and 3 2 1 the amounts of pn ps ha and the major functional groups increased from s eps to lb eps and from lb eps to tb eps figs 1a and 2a the interactions between these groups such as hydrogen bonding intensified leading to an increase in the aggregation percentage and rate after s eps and lb eps extraction hydrogen bonding has already been proposed as the predominant trigger for sludge aggregation guo et al 2016 the fact that the extraction of tb eps also increased the aggregation of anammox consortia might be the result of the expression of abundant pn acting as biological adhesives on the surface of the bacteria the conclusion that the extraction of the three stratified eps subfractions s eps lb eps and tb eps stimulated the initial aggregation of anammox consortia was unexpected the aggregation ability of anammox consortia might depend on the anammox consortia expressing adhesion molecules on the bacteria surface although lb eps and tb eps were reported to contribute to the aggregation of activated sludge and anaerobic methanogenic sludge liu et al 2010 the aggregation potential of biofilm bacteria in a sequencing batch biofilm reactor treating synthetic organic wastewater has already been ascribed to the bacteria themselves but not to the secretion of eps zhang et al 2014 the aggregation ability of e coli mg1655 is also thought to be governed by the cells themselves eboigbodin and biggs 2008 a recent synthetic bacterial cell cell adhesion toolbox hypothesizes that pn are expressed as a nanobodies or antigens on the e coli cell surface that specifically adhere to each other glass and riedel kruse 2018 the amino and carboxyl groups of the pn could stimulate aggregation reactions by promoting the formation hydrogen bonds similarly we hypothesized that the initial aggregation of planktonic anammox bacteria might also depend on the expression of complementary antigens and antibodies on the anammox bacteria surface that interact specifically or nonspecifically as adhesion molecules 3 4 contribution of stratified eps to abiotic surface adhesion of anammox consortia the role of stratified eps subfractions in adhesion of anammox consortia to abiotic surfaces was investigated using the qcm d technique qcm d is a popular non destructive technique to study the adherence and viscoelastic properties of biomolecules or bacteria on various surfaces amer et al 2011 contreras et al 2011 gold coated sensor chips were used in the experiment to mimic abiotic surfaces such as carrier surfaces silts and nuclei 3 4 1 adherence and viscoelastic properties of stratified eps subfractions the adherence and viscoelastic properties of the stratified eps subfractions on abiotic surfaces were first analyzed using eps adsorption experiments on gold coated sensor chips fig 5 prior to the experiment each stratified eps subfraction solution was diluted to 20 mg doc l lb eps was the most viscous of the stratified eps subfractions and formed the most rigid and compact adhered layer on the abiotic gold surface figs 5a and b shows that the δf and δd of the gold coated sensor chips reflected the formation of an eps adhesion layer on the surfaces of the chips the faster the decrease in δf the stronger the eps adherence amer et al 2011 lb eps had the highest adhesion rate with the fastest decrease in δf while tb eps had the lowest adhesion rate the decreased values of δf were 18 2 0 1 23 8 0 1 and 15 5 0 1 hz for s eps lb eps and tb eps respectively fig 5a p 0 001 the decrease in δf is positively correlated to the adsorbed mass jenia et al 2013 therefore the adsorbed mass was also the highest in lb eps and the lowest in tb eps in accord with the adhesion rate surprisingly this tendency was in good agreement with the pn ps and the α helix β sheet random coil value table 1 as mentioned in section 3 2 2 lb eps had the most compact secondary structure with the hydrophobic functional groups wrapped inside the structure therefore lb eps molecules that attached to the sensor chips were less likely to be adhered and washed away by other lb eps molecules in solution this explains the stronger adhesion of lb eps δd reflects the viscoelastic properties of the adhered biomolecules layer δd and δf are plotted together in fig 5c the slope of δd over δ is the induced energy dissipation per coupled unit mass the greater the absolute value of the slope the more viscous and loose the adhered biomolecules layer contreras et al 2011 leino et al 2011 biomolecules of lb eps formed the most rigid and compact adhered layer while biomolecules of tb eps formed the most thick and loose adhered layer on sensor chips the zeta potentials of the eps solutions were also tested fig s6 the zeta potential decreased successively from s eps to lb eps to tb eps indicating increasing stability compared with the zeta potential the adhesion of biomolecules on abiotic surfaces was more closely related to the structure of the biomolecules figs 5a c and table 1 a more compact structure exposes fewer functional groups and binding sites to the solution thus making the adhered biomolecules less likely to be adhere to and washed away by other biomolecules in the solution 3 4 2 adherence and viscoelastic properties of anammox consortia on abiotic surfaces the qcm d technique was also used to study the adherence and viscoelastic properties of anammox consortia with and without eps subfractions on abiotic surfaces as shown in figs 5d and e sludge i before extraction had the highest decrease rate of δf indicating that sludge i adhered more easily to the surfaces of the gold coated chips sludge iv had the lowest rate of decrease of δf while sludges ii and iii had decrease rates of δf between those of sludges i and iv the decreased values of δf were 15 2 0 1 11 2 0 1 9 2 0 1 and 10 5 0 1 hz for sludges i ii iii and iv respectively p 0 001 these results suggest that the secretion of tb eps increased the adhesion rate of anammox consortia while the secretion of lb eps and s eps increased both the adhesion rate and the adhered mass the most flat and rigid adsorbed layer was also found in sludge i before eps extraction fig 5f with the lowest δd δf slope of 0 0496 0 0004 note that all the three sludge samples with eps sludges i ii and iii had higher rates of decrease of δf and lower δd δf slopes compared with the sludge sample without eps sludge iv this illustrates the vital role played by all the three stratified eps subfractions in the adhesion of anammox consortia to abiotic surfaces and the formation of compact adhesion structures the adhesion of anammox consortia to inert particulates mimicked by gold coated chips was inhibited by the extraction of eps subfractions this behavior was exactly the opposite of the trend observed in the aggregation behavior of the anammox consortia the order of importance of the eps subfractions in adhesion to abiotic surfaces was s eps lb eps tb eps analogously to the eps adhesion results in section 3 4 1 the adhesion of eps biomolecules on the abiotic surface was influenced by the adhesion of adhered eps biomolecules the stronger the adhesion to eps biomolecules in the solution the lower the adsorption rate in this regard the experimental results on the adhesion of anammox consortia to abiotic surface were in accord with the aggregation behavior fig 4 and table 2 sludge iv aggregated more easily with other bacteria in solution and thus had a slower adhesion rate to the abiotic surface while sludge i aggregated less and thus adhered more quickly to the abiotic surface 3 5 proposed role of stratified eps in the initial anammox biofilm formation from planktonic bacteria to mature biofilms the initial adhesion of bacteria to other bacteria or to inert particulates is inevitable lin and wang 2017 liu and tay 2004 the microaggregates thus generated serve as precursors to the formation of biofilms it has been hypothesized in previous researches on granulation processes that the secretion of eps which acts as a biological glue is the next step in the formation of microaggregates adav et al 2008 sarma et al 2017 anammox biofilm formation also proceeds by the initial adhesion of anammox bacteria to bacteria and inert particulates based on the adhesion results of both aggregation assays and qcm d figs 4 and 5 we suggest that the initial aggregation of anammox bacteria occurs because of the expression of adhesion molecules on the surfaces of the bacteria with no contribution from eps fig 6 the expression of adhesion molecules stimulates the aggregation of anammox bacteria and the secretion of the three stratified eps begins only after the initial aggregation of small numbers of anammox bacteria this results in the formation of a compact anammox bacteria cluster fig 5 the adhesion of inert particulates such as carrier surfaces silts and saline precipitates is also stimulated by the secreted eps fig 5 finally anammox bacteria clusters filamentous bacteria other planktonic bacteria and inert particulates co adhere forming either a compact adhesion layer as a precursor to anammox biofilm formation or forming compact microaggregates as precursors to anammox granule formation this hypothesis on the initial aggregation of anammox consortia can explain the phenomena that the addition of calcium or magnesium ions saline precipitates graaff et al 2011 zeolites fernández et al 2008 and inactive methanogenic granules ni et al 2010 accelerate the formation of anammox biofilms the artificial dosing of inert particulates as nuclei to accelerate anammox biofilms formation can be used for engineering applications this can also lead to a compact biofilm structure which is important for preventing biofilm breakage 4 conclusions in this work the eps of anammox granules stratified as s eps lb eps and tb eps were separately extracted and characterized to elucidate their influence on anammox consortia surface properties the role of stratified eps of anammox granules in the initial anammox consortia aggregation was clarified using aggregation assays before and after the extraction of each stratified eps subfraction the adherence to abiotic surfaces and the viscoelastic properties of both stratified eps subfractions and anammox consortia with and without each stratified eps subfraction were systematically investigated using the novel qcm d technique understanding these roles of stratified eps subfraction will aid in the cultivation of anammox biofilms and maintaining the stability of anammox biofilm based processes the main outcomes were as follows tb eps were the most abundant eps subfractions and pn were the primary eps constituents of anammox granules the major functional groups were quite similar in the three eps subfractions but the concentrations of the functional groups followed the order s eps lb eps tb eps lb eps had the most compact protein secondary structure the aggregation of anammox bacteria was mostly controlled by interactions such as hydrogen bonding between functional groups the extraction of each of the three eps subfractions stimulated the aggregation of anammox consortia the adhesion of anammox consortia to abiotic surfaces was inhibited by the extraction of eps subfractions the order of importance of the contributions of the eps subfractions to adhesion to abiotic surfaces was s eps lb eps tb eps the ability of anammox consortia to aggregate is due to the bacteria themselves rather than to eps the expression of adhesion molecules on the surfaces of the bacteria plays an important role in the aggregation process while the stratified eps subfractions stimulate the adhesion of inert particulates

18353,while disinfection processes have been central for public health protection new concerns have been raised with respect to their ability to control the spread of antibiotic resistance in the environment in this study we report the inactivation kinetics by peracetic and performic acids of a typical indicator escherichia coli and its corresponding antibiotic resistant subpopulation in secondary settled wastewater effluent performic acid always showed greater inactivation efficiency than peracetic acid whether or not the indicator was ampicillin resistant observed inactivation data fitted with an exposure based inactivation model predicted very well the inactivation profile of both total and ampicillin resistant escherichia coli notably the antibiotic resistance percentage decreased significantly in treated wastewater compared to untreated wastewater thus making the peracid based disinfection processes beneficial in controlling antibiotic resistance in secondary settled wastewater moreover the minimum inhibitory concentration values remained unchanged finally antibiotic resistant specific inactivation kinetics were used to predict the disinfection efficiency in continuous flow reactors under ideal and non ideal hydraulics thus providing useful information for future design and operation of disinfection process in antibiotic resistance controlling mode keywords antibiotic resistant bacteria inactivation kinetics escherichia coli peracetic acid performic acid secondary effluent 1 introduction the excessive use of antibiotics in human animal and plant therapies has considerably reduced their effectiveness and caused the spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria arbs in the environment he et al 2019 by facilitating the transfer of resistance genes between non pathogenic arbs to pathogenic bacteria manaia et al 2010 marti and balcázar 2013 yoon et al 2017 as a result the world health organization who has been paying increased attention to this issue by establishing antibiotic resistance as a critical global public health issue of this century sharma et al 2016 some environmental compartments offer ideal conditions for the spread of arbs in the environment rizzo et al 2013a roca et al 2015 manaia et al 2016 mcconnell et al 2018 among those wastewater has been reported to be an important vehicle of dissemination through which resistance genes are introduced into natural bacterial ecosystems for instance hospital wastewater which represents a concentrated stream of antibiotic resistant organisms baquero et al 2008 has been documented as hotspot for the release of antibiotics and arbs into the environment ferro et al 2016 luprano et al 2016 makowska et al 2016 irrespective of the process used wastewater disinfection i e the final treatment step in wastewater treatment is a unit process designed to inactivate pathogenic microorganisms sensitive to biocides rather controlling antibiotic resistant organisms consequently inappropriate amounts of disinfectants could inadvertently be selected for the arbs as reported in rizzo et al 2013b arbs have shown to present good tolerance to conventional chlorine disinfection liu et al 2018 several studies indicated that chlorination of wastewater does not eliminate the risk of antibiotic resistance release and proliferation in receiving bodies yuan et al 2015 templeton et al 2009 demonstrated a major resistance to chlorine treatment for trimethoprim resistant escherichia coli furthermore the inactivation caused by chlorine based disinfecting agents such as sodium hypochlorite could induce the release of antibiotic resistance genes from damaged cells turolla et al 2018 liu et al 2018 which will be later acquired by other bacteria becoming arbs a potential relationship between amount of chlorine and arbs formation was suggested di cesare et al 2016 additional studies have demonstrated an increase in the ratio of arbs over the total population of the same strain after chlorination treatment specifically murray et al 1984 and staley et al 1988 reported an increased percentage of tetracycline resistant bacteria after chlorination peracetic acid paa

formation of disinfection by products dell erba et al 2007 nurizzo et al 2005 crebelli et al 2005 during disinfection paa acts mainly by oxidizing sulfhydryl and sulfur bonds in proteins and enzymes biswal et al 2014 paa inactivation mechanism mainly involves the disruption of the chemiosmotic function of the microbial cell caused by rupture or dislocation of the cell walls altering lipoprotein cytoplasmic membrane and transport systems secondary inactivation mechanisms could also contribute to the overall inactivation via the formation of hydroxyl radicals oh lubello et al 2002 and peroxide radicals oxygen oxygen bond kitis 2004 similarly to paa performic acid pfa ch2o3 i e the organic peroxide of formic acid is a highly effective disinfectant recently tested for wastewater treatment gehr et al 2009 pfa is an unstable chemical that needs to be generated on site as a quaternary equilibrium mixture of pfa formic acid fa hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and water generally pfa provides a faster and more effective disinfection compared to paa for municipal wastewater karpova et al 2013 ragazzo et al 2013 and combined sewer overflow chhetri et al 2015 to date pfa has not been assessed against the inactivation of arbs bacteria could develop resistance to ampicillin via the production of b lactamases that break the b lactam ring of the antibiotic and the production of modified pbps that are not recognized by ampicillin godfrey et al 1981 ampicillin amp is a widely used chemical against gram positive and gram negative bacteria belonging to the class of b lactams antibiotics it acts on peptidoglycan which prevents the formation of cross linkages of the cell wall by transpeptidase enzymes called penicillin binding proteins pbps pbps remove a terminal d alanine residue from the pentapeptide releasing energy that is used for cross linking in peptidoglycan ampicillin inhibits pbps by a competitive mechanism because it resembles the d ala d ala dimer malouin and bryan 1986 irrespective of the biocide considered available inactivation kinetics which are central in the design of disinfection processes are only limited to the total bacterial population which is constituted by both arbs and non arbs while many antibiotic resistant bacteria have been reported e coli is considered the most representative organism to study the behavior of such resistant organisms guo et al 2013 in this work two categories of bacteria were used herein defined as total e coli a population that represents the entire group of e coli both sensitive and resistant to the selected antibiotic and the ar sub population indicating the sub population of e coli resistant to ampicillin ampr e coli as such we aimed at establishing the inactivation kinetics for both total e coli and ampr e coli against paa and pfa with the objective of understanding if such kinetics differs from each other and how much are impacted by water quality the microbial inactivation parameters estimated through modeling of batch experimental data were used to simulate the performance of arb inactivation in continuous flow system under realistic wastewater treatment conditions including ideal and non ideal reactor hydraulics such simulations could be used to guide the development and the adoption of emerging disinfectants such as paa and pfa aiming to the control of pathogens as well as the release in the environment of antibiotic resistant bacteria 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater characteristics secondary effluent was collected from a municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp in spain 373

based on the minimum inhibitory concentration mic of the antibiotic from eucast 2018 2 2 2 inoculum and sample preparation a volume of 0 1 ml of wastewater effluent was placed on cca and cca with amp to select total and ampr e coli respectively and incubated overnight at 37 c grown e coli and ampr e coli colonies were picked up re cultivated in macconkey broth mcb panreac applichem and mcb with 16

abs600nm 0 12 both for e coli and ampr e coli both the saline solution nacl 0 9 and the secondary effluent were inoculated with the suspensions to augment the e coli and ampr e coli initial concentrations which allowed for a more precise characterization of their inactivation kinetics 2 2 3 disinfection tests the inactivation profiles of total and ampr e coli were evaluated both in secondary effluent ph 7 5 0 1 and as a comparison in nacl 0 9 solution 0 9 saline solution ph 6 2 0 1 with no bioavailable carbon and free of suspended solids in this medium bacteria remained stable because of their totally compatible osmotic cell pressure nacl 0 9 was selected among the various saline solutions as it was successfully been used in previous studies keser et al 2018 lópez briz et

wastewater were used residual disinfectant measurements and microbial analysis were performed on samples withdrawn at defined contact times and transferred to sterile vials pre loaded with 0 1 m

darmstadt germany allowing a measure in a range of 0 01 8 00 mg l paa and 0 01 6 50 mg l pfa in order to evaluate the paa and pfa disinfection efficacy on ampr e coli antibiotic resistance was also investigated by quantifying the mic before and after the treatment to understand if the resistance remained constant or underwent changes during the disinfection process 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 bacterial enumeration total and ampr e coli microbial analyses were performed in triplicate according to the standard membrane filtration method 9222g apha american public health association 2017 each

with amp antibiotic strips oxoid m i c evaluator was performed to measure mic values the strips were marked by a growing antibiotic concentration that corresponds to the mics in the ampicillin strips the mic range was 0 015 256 μg ml a calibration line with mcfarland turbidity standards was constructed for the test the standard 0 5 mcfarland was prepared with 0 5 ml of 0 048 m bacl2 1 175 wt vol bacl2 2h2o panreac and 99 5 ml of 0 18 m h2so4 1 vol vol panreac applichem continuously mixing by reading the spectrophotometer the 0 5 macfarland corresponded to the absorbance at 625 nm of 0 10 ampr e coli colonies grown on cca supplemented with 16 mg l of amp were placed in 0 9 saline solution until the measured turbidity reached the value of 0 5 mcfarland which corresponded to a concentration of 1 5 108 cfu ml the solutions were spread homogeneously with sterile tampon in muller hinton agar plates merck kgaa and amp strips were placed on the surface of the media the plates were incubated for 24 h at 37 c the procedure was repeated in duplicate ampr e coli growth became visible near the inhibition halo formed around the strips the point at which the inhibition eclipse began to intersect the strips corresponded to the value of the mic 2 4 models 2 4 1 chemical disinfectant decay model when a chemical disinfectant i e paa or pfa is added to wastewater it initially undergoes an instantaneous demand d followed by a first order decay k haas and joffe 1994 haas and karra 1984 described by eq 1 1 c c 0 d k t c 0 d e kt the concentration of disinfectant c mg l at time t min is

includes an initial fast inactivation of dispersed microbes followed by a slower inactivation of particles associated microbes also known as tailing effect santoro et al 2015 this biphasic behavior of microbial inactivation can be described by the sum of 2 exponential terms double exponential model each corresponding to dispersed and particles associated phases recently a term m was added to the double exponential model to account for shoulder effects observed at low ict doses for the inactivation of bacteria by disinfectants manoli et al 2019 the ict based double exponential model is given by eq 4 4 n n 0 β k p k d m ict n 0 1 β e k d ict m n 0 β e k p ict where n0 and n are the initial and final concentrations of culturable microbes respectively in colony forming units cfu 100 ml apart

peracid decay in secondary effluent and in 0 9 saline solution are shown in fig 1 both paa and pfa followed first order decay kinetics k with initial demand d in secondary effluent wastewater paa suffers a decomposition of 21 in 32 min at both initial concentrations of 3 and 4 mg l in the case of pfa a reduction of 29 and 35 in 15 min at initial concentrations of 1 and 2 mg l respectively was observed the determined k values were higher for pfa than paa table 2 the faster decomposition of pfa compared with paa was also observed in combined sewer overflow disinfection experiments chhetri et al 2014 in 0 9 saline solution peracids degradation is lower than in wastewater for instance paa decreased 9 in both concentrations and pfa decreased 10 at 0 5 mg l and 20 at 1 mg l the higher decomposition in wastewater was expected due to side reactions of disinfectants with water contaminants the factors affecting the decomposition rate of peracids in wastewater are its temperature ph the amount of organic material the presence of suspended solids or transition metal ions salinity and water hardness luukkonen and pehkonen 2016 sarathy et al 2016 paa and pfa decompositions were modeled using eq 1 determined d and k are given in table 2 the model could predict well the decomposition of paa and pfa in 0 9 saline solution and wastewater fig 1 3 2 inactivation of total and ampr e coli by paa and pfa the inactivation kinetics of total and ampr e coli by paa and pfa in secondary effluent and in 0 9 saline solution are shown in figs 2 and 3 respectively the ict were calculated using eq 2 in secondary effluent the initial concentration was 6 0 and 5 6 log unit of total and ampr e coli respectively a complete inactivation by paa was observed at ict values of 80 mg min l and 55 mg min l for total and ampr e coli respectively indicating faster inactivation of ampr e coli than total e coli shoulder effects were seen in both cases fig 2a for example ampr e coli removal of half log was observed with paa ict 15 8 mg min l whereas almost one log inactivation was obtained at a paa ict of 30 mg min l results are in agreement with previous studies in wastewater although the concentrations of disinfectant used were higher than ours paa 2 8 mg l time 27 60 min log reduction 2 4 4 dell erba et al 2004 koivunen and heinonen tanski 2005a caretti and lubello 2003 in 0 9 saline solution shoulder effects were seen at paa ict dose up to 8 mg min l being bacteria much more sensitive to inactivation than in wastewater where shoulder effects were observed up to ict of 20 mg min l fig 2 similar inactivation curve of total and ampr e coli by paa was observed in 0 9 saline solution at paa ict of 29 0 mg min l 5 log removal was achieved in the case of pfa a 4 log removal of total e coli was observed at ict of 15 mg min l in secondary effluent fig 3a for ampr e coli 1 and 2 log reductions were achieved at ict of 4 7 and 6 8 mg min l respectively and abatement values below 100 cfu 100 ml were observed at pfa ict of 10 mg min l the faster inactivation of ampr e coli compared to total e coli by pfa in wastewater is consistent with their inactivation by paa figs 2 and 3a in 0 9 saline solution the inactivation of ampr e coli was similar to the total e coli which is consistent with what was observed in the case of paa figs 2b and 3b a 4 log removal was observed at pfa ict of 4 3 mg min l all pfa results showed that most of the bacteria removal took place at ict of 10 mg min l this agrees with other studies where the majority of microorganisms were efficiently inactivated at a concentration of pfa of 2 ppm in 5 min corresponding to an ict of 10 mg min l karpova et al 2013 clearly pfa requires lower ict compared to paa for the same bacteria log reduction in both wastewater and 0 9 saline solution figs 2 and 3 a previous study comparing the disinfecting power of paa and pfa reported that at the same concentration 1 5 mg l and contact time 60 min 1 6 and 3 5 log reductions of total e coli were achieved respectively luukkonen et al 2015 similar observation of faster pfa inactivation compared to paa was reported by other research groups for total e coli and clostridium tyrobutyricum mora et al 2018 ragazzo et al 2013 the aforementioned studies focused on the total e coli to the best of our knowledge this is the first time that paa and pfa are compared in terms of inactivating ampr e coli inactivation curves were characterized by three phases firstly a lag phase at the beginning of the process which represents the shoulder trend indicating an initial resistance to paa diffusion and bacteria inactivation likely due to the action of bacteria antioxidant enzymes that form the first line of defense against free radicals secondly an exponential decay with maximum inactivation rate where the disinfectant penetrates into microbial pathogens generating disruption of cell membranes and blockage of enzymatic and transport systems in the microorganisms finally an asymptotic deceleration phase called tailing where the inactivation rate decreased mezzanotte et al 2007 shoulder effects were observed in all cases figs 2 and 3 however such effect was less pronounced for 0 9 saline solution compared to secondary effluent some studies have concluded that disinfection is dependent on the water quality due to the presence of organic matter in different proportions the 0 9 saline solution and secondary effluent contain different amounts of organic matter solids and initial concentration of bacteria and for that reason in secondary effluent a higher concentration of disinfectant is required to obtain the same disinfection efficiency as in 0 9 saline solution koivunen and heinonen tanski 2005b karpova et al 2013 likewise the larger shoulder effect in secondary effluent was consistent with the inactivation mechanism of the chemical disinfectant that had to diffuse firstly through particles and secondly through the cell membrane during tailing phase inactivation decreased leaving the bacteria that survived to disinfection at even higher ict this occurrence could depend on suspended solids and microbial clumping that protect microbes koivunen and heinonen tanski 2005b according to kacem et al 2014 the tail could be related to the development of bacterial resistance during the disinfection treatment with a phenomenon of inhibition produced by the competitive action of the organic products released into the environment since the 0 9 saline solution is free of suspended solids it is hypothesized that the tailing trend is caused only by an aggregating bacterial tendency bohrerova and linden 2006 mir et al 1997 the bacteria located on the outside of the aggregate were more sensitive to disinfectant s attack and consequently they were inactivated faster whereas the bacteria in the center of the aggregate have a higher survival rate and therefore these bacteria can be found and quantified during the tailing phase domínguez henao et al 2018 in wastewater kinetic curves total e coli and ampr e coli showed a starting tailing at paa ict of 80 and 60 mg min l respectively while in 0 9 saline solution a final tailing phase was observed at paa ict slightly higher than 20 mg min l with pfa the tailing phase began in an ict range between 10 and 15 mg min l in wastewater compared with ict values of 7 mg min l in 0 9 saline solution in general lower ict was required in 0 9 saline solution compared to secondary effluent to achieve the same inactivation of both total and ampr e coli as mentioned the disinfection is dependent on the water quality i e ph bacterial aggregation and suspended solids that characterize the two aqueous matrices the ph value of secondary effluent was about 7 5 the initial ph of 0 9 saline solution was 6 2 adding paa at 1 and 2 ppm reduced the ph at the values of 5 3 and 4 8 respectively while the ph decreased to 4 9 and 4 5 respectively with 0 5 and 1 mg l of pfa lower ph of 0 9 saline solution probably caused the enhancement in terms of inactivation the presence of suspended solids in wastewater may also play a role in the slower inactivation in wastewater than 0 9 saline solution in the absence of suspended solids domínguez henao et al 2018 reported negative impact of suspended solids on disinfection of total e coli by paa because of their protective role on bacteria in all cases the double exponential model eq 4 in the ict domain fitted very well the data figs 2 and 3 the determined microbial inactivation kinetic parameters are given in table 3 the values of β and m agreed with previous results of sarathy et al 2016 β 0 0011 and m 2 27 3 3 inactivation of indigenous ampr e coli by pfa experiments with real concentration of indigenous ampr e coli were performed to investigate their inactivation by pfa and to rule out a possible effect of the inoculum results of inactivation of indigenous total and ampr e coli are presented in fig 4 initial indigenous total and ampr e coli concentrations were 4 8 and 4 4 log unit respectively the kinetic curves were represented as a function of time fig 4a and c and as a function of ict fig 4b and d indigenous bacteria followed the same trend as the inoculated population two different curves were observed when the concentration of total or ampr e coli was plotted as a function of contact time for two different concentrations of pfa fig 4a and c when the x axis was corrected for ict dose eq 2 a single curve could fit the data at both initial concentrations of pfa i e ict dose response fig 4b and d the same kinetic parameters were used for time curves eq 5 and ict based curves eq 4 table 4 compared to pfa tests with inoculated e coli the β and k d values were greater while k p and m were lower this indicates that in real wastewater there was a higher particle associated fraction of total and ampr e coli β and lower shoulder effects m it could be hypothesized that the smaller m value was associated with less bacterial aggregation considering that in the inoculated wastewater effluent the order of magnitude of bacteria was 106 cfu 100 ml compared to only 104 cfu 100 ml of indigenous bacteria in any case through this experimental test it could be affirmed that indigenous bacteria had the same behavior as those inoculated in wastewater both indigenous and inoculated bacteria can be fitted to the ict model and this was consistent for both total and ampr e coli the ict based kinetic model could predict the inactivation of e coli as a function of time as well as a function of ict to guarantee an adequate performance of the disinfection process it is important to check the quality of the effluent and the dose of disinfectant to be used according to the contact time the use of the model can be a fundamental control strategy that responds to variations during disinfection in real time manoli et al 2019 ict model can have practical implications in designing a disinfection system for example the ict dose response can be used to select an ict to achieve desired disinfection performance i e final concentration of microbes 3 4 resistance assay of e coli in secondary effluent the ar of indigenous e coli was calculated as a ratio of number of bacteria grown while exposed to 16 mg l of ampicillin to bacteria grown without antibiotic the ar was 38 6 which agrees with previous studies reporting ar from 34 to 47 luczkiewicz et al 2010 huang et al 2012 after 16 min of contact time the ar of indigenous bacteria decreased from 38 6 to 30 4 and 25 for 1 and 2 mg l of pfa respectively the inoculum increased the number of total e coli and ampr e coli from 4 4 to 4 8 to up to 5 6 6 0 log unit for the non inoculated and the inoculated secondary effluent respectively due to the increased amount of ampr e coli an increase of percentage of residual resistance was observed for the augmented wastewater samples with values between 40 and 88 in the saline solution the inoculation led to ar of 85 in the all tested samples although a variation of initial ar was achieved in the inoculated samples a reduction in ar between 68 3 and 93 3 for paa and greater than 85 4 for pfa was observed in the points corresponding to the tailing phase fig 5 for example in wastewater the ar decreased from 40 to 2 7 at 3 mg l of paa and contact time of 16 min treatment with pfa resulted in a reduction of ar from 93 9 to 3 5 at 1 mg l of pfa reduction of ar was also observed in 0 9 saline solution for both paa and pfa fig 5 compares the ar before the disinfection treatment the ar reached observed at the tailing phase and the respective reduction in antibiotic resistance among the major determinants of b lactam antibiotic resistance there are the b lactamase enzymes that can be transferred by resistant bacteria occurring in wastewater to indigenous aquatic bacteria through plasmids or other mobile genetic elements generally in wwtp the high concentration of bacteria nutrients and in particular suspended solids are all elements that favor horizontal gene transfer guardabassi and dalsgaardand 2002 and consequently could induce an increase in arb concentrations chlorine based disinfectants can increase the percentage of arbs al jassim et al 2015 compared the degree of resistance to various antibiotics including ampicillin among the isolated bacteria from wastewaters treated with chlorine reporting that the ar increased by 28 after chlorination ferreira da silva et al 2007 showed that resistance to antibiotics amoxicillin ciprofloxacin tetracycline and cephalothin in escherichia spp isolates increased by 5 10 in treated wastewater compared to untreated wastewater these studies suggest that chlorination promoted the enrichment and selection of arbs the reduction of ar by paa and pfa observed herein is important since this is a major challenge for wwtp using chlorine based disinfectants in wastewater among the ampr e coli that survived the treatments the mic was analyzed to determine if the amp concentration to which e coli was resistant underwent variations the results showed that the resistance remained constant at mic values 256 μg ml of amp in all the following pfa ict values 0 2 0 4 7 1 7 6 mg min l and paa ict of 0 5 0 9 29 31 1 mg min l results suggest that in the presence of paa and pfa the resistant bacteria became weaker further investigations are needed to understand how these disinfectants act on β lactamases and on other ampicillin resistance genes 3 5 prediction of continuous flow disinfection performance the chemical and microbial inactivation kinetic parameters determined herein in batch lab scale experiments in wastewater tables 2 and 3 were used to simulate the reduction of total and ampr e coli under realistic continuous flow conditions the same concentration after the initial demand was used for both paa and pfa i e c0 d 2 mg l considering that the disinfection of wastewater usually takes place in a continuous flow reactor the hydraulics of the reactor should be considered when trying to predict the disinfection performance the ict dose for a continuous flow reactor is a function of its hydraulic behavior eq 3 two cases were studied i e ideal pfr n 10 and a poor hydraulics reactor n 1 eq 6 was applied to predict the concentration of total and ampr e coli at the outlet n of a continuous flow reactor as a function of contact time i e hydraulic residence time hrt which is the volume of the reactor v over the water flow q results are presented in fig 6 in all cases the difference between ideal and non ideal hydraulics was more obvious at high hrts for example the greatest difference between ideal nn 10 and non ideal nn 1 hydraulics for paa inactivation of total e coli was determined at hrt of 45 min where nn 1 was around 5 times higher than nn 10 fig 6a such difference in concentration of total e coli at the outlet of the reactor due to different hydraulics may have practical implications in meeting the regulations for disinfection of secondary effluent wastewater in the case of paa inactivation of ampr e coli lower hrts were required for the same log removal compared to total e coli which agrees with results obtained in batch experiments fig 2a b 6a and 6b for ampr e coli the difference in n between ideal and non ideal reactor was not that important i e the biggest difference was observed at hrt of 25 min where the nn 1 was around 2 5 times higher than nn 10 fig 6b shorter hrts were required by pfa than paa fig 6 this was expected due to the faster microbial inactivation kinetics of pfa compared to paa figs 2 3 and 6 and table 3 for example an hrt of 45 min and 9 min was needed by paa and pfa respectively to achieve a concentration of total e coli at the outlet of the reactor of around 100 cfu 100 ml in the case of ampr e coli the required hrt was lower i e 5 min and 32 min for pfa and paa respectively the fast kinetics of pfa resulted in overall less effect of hydraulics than the effect seen for paa for both total and ampr e coli fig 6 the concentration of total and ampr e coli at the outlet of the reactor under poor hydraulics nn 1 was at maximum around 2 times higher than ideal hydraulics nn 10 in the case of pfa fig 6c and d results obtained herein through the modeling of a continuous flow reactor under realistic conditions may have practical implications in designing paa and pfa disinfection processes the prediction of the concentration of total and ampr e coli at the outlet of the reactor as a function of hrt under ideal pfr and poor hydraulics conditions is important in directing operators on the optimization of the process of chemical disinfection this may result in environmental and economic benefits 4 conclusions based on the results and discussions illustrated above the following conclusions could be made the assay of ampicillin resistance revealed that sensitive and resistant e coli were affected by paa and pfa in a similar manner the ar was decreased by both paa and pfa indicating a great potential of the proposed chemical disinfectants in controlling antibiotic resistance in wastewater mic analysis showed that resistant e coli maintained the same level of amp resistance 256 μg ml during treatment with paa or pfa in wastewater making these disinfectants attractive alternatives to chlorine in all conditions tested pfa was more effective than paa in secondary effluent wastewater complete log removal was achieved with pfa ict of 15 mg min l compared to paa ict of 60 mg min l the double exponential microbial inactivation kinetic model predicted well the inactivation of total and ampr e coli by paa and pfa the continuous disinfection flow model extended in this study to antibiotic resistant e coli is a powerful tool which can be used to derive useful information for sizing paa and pfa disinfection system under realistic hydraulic conditions

18353,while disinfection processes have been central for public health protection new concerns have been raised with respect to their ability to control the spread of antibiotic resistance in the environment in this study we report the inactivation kinetics by peracetic and performic acids of a typical indicator escherichia coli and its corresponding antibiotic resistant subpopulation in secondary settled wastewater effluent performic acid always showed greater inactivation efficiency than peracetic acid whether or not the indicator was ampicillin resistant observed inactivation data fitted with an exposure based inactivation model predicted very well the inactivation profile of both total and ampicillin resistant escherichia coli notably the antibiotic resistance percentage decreased significantly in treated wastewater compared to untreated wastewater thus making the peracid based disinfection processes beneficial in controlling antibiotic resistance in secondary settled wastewater moreover the minimum inhibitory concentration values remained unchanged finally antibiotic resistant specific inactivation kinetics were used to predict the disinfection efficiency in continuous flow reactors under ideal and non ideal hydraulics thus providing useful information for future design and operation of disinfection process in antibiotic resistance controlling mode keywords antibiotic resistant bacteria inactivation kinetics escherichia coli peracetic acid performic acid secondary effluent 1 introduction the excessive use of antibiotics in human animal and plant

genes are introduced into natural bacterial ecosystems for instance hospital wastewater which represents a concentrated stream of antibiotic resistant organisms baquero et al 2008 has been documented as hotspot for the release of antibiotics and arbs into the environment ferro et al 2016 luprano et al 2016 makowska et al 2016 irrespective of the process used wastewater disinfection i e the final treatment step in wastewater treatment is a unit process designed to inactivate pathogenic microorganisms sensitive to biocides rather controlling antibiotic resistant organisms consequently inappropriate amounts of disinfectants could inadvertently be selected for the arbs as reported in rizzo et al 2013b arbs have shown to present good tolerance to conventional chlorine disinfection liu et al 2018 several studies indicated that chlorination of wastewater does not eliminate the risk of antibiotic resistance release and proliferation in receiving bodies yuan et al 2015 templeton et al 2009 demonstrated a major resistance to chlorine treatment for trimethoprim resistant escherichia coli furthermore the inactivation caused by chlorine based disinfecting agents such as sodium hypochlorite could induce the release of antibiotic resistance genes from damaged cells turolla et al 2018 liu et al 2018 which will be later acquired by other bacteria becoming arbs a potential relationship between amount of chlorine and arbs formation was suggested di cesare et al 2016 additional studies have demonstrated an increase in the ratio of arbs over the total population of the

faster and more effective disinfection compared to paa for municipal wastewater karpova et al 2013 ragazzo et al 2013 and combined sewer overflow chhetri et al 2015 to date pfa has not been assessed against the inactivation of arbs bacteria could develop resistance to ampicillin via the production of b lactamases that break the b lactam ring of the antibiotic and the production of modified pbps that are not recognized by ampicillin godfrey et al 1981 ampicillin amp is a widely used chemical against gram positive and gram negative bacteria belonging to the class of b lactams antibiotics it acts on peptidoglycan which prevents the formation of cross linkages of the cell wall by transpeptidase enzymes called penicillin binding proteins pbps pbps remove a terminal d alanine residue from the pentapeptide releasing energy that is used for cross linking in peptidoglycan ampicillin inhibits pbps by a competitive mechanism because it resembles the d ala d ala dimer malouin and bryan 1986 irrespective of the biocide considered available inactivation kinetics which are central in the design of disinfection processes are only limited to the total bacterial population which is constituted by both arbs and non arbs while many antibiotic resistant bacteria have been reported e coli is considered the most representative organism to study the behavior of such resistant organisms guo et al 2013 in this work two categories of bacteria were used herein defined as total e coli a population that represents the entire group of e coli both sensitive and resistant to the selected antibiotic and the ar sub population indicating the sub population of e coli resistant to ampicillin ampr e coli as such we aimed at establishing the inactivation kinetics for both total e coli and ampr e coli against paa and pfa with the objective of understanding if such kinetics differs from each other and how much are impacted by water quality the microbial inactivation parameters estimated through modeling of batch experimental data were used to simulate the performance of arb inactivation in continuous flow system under realistic wastewater treatment conditions including ideal and non ideal reactor hydraulics such simulations could be used to guide the development and the adoption of emerging disinfectants such as paa and pfa aiming to the control of pathogens as well as the release in the environment of antibiotic resistant bacteria 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater characteristics secondary effluent was collected from a municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp in spain 373

panreac applichem was used for e coli enumeration ampr e coli quantification was performed with cca supplemented with 16 mg l of ampicillin sodium salt sigma aldrich this concentration was chosen based on the minimum inhibitory concentration mic of the antibiotic from eucast 2018 2 2 2 inoculum and sample preparation a volume of 0 1 ml of wastewater effluent was placed on cca and cca with amp

abs600nm 0 12 both for e coli and ampr e coli both the saline solution nacl 0 9 and the secondary effluent were inoculated with the suspensions to augment the e coli and ampr e coli initial concentrations which allowed for a more precise characterization of their inactivation kinetics 2 2 3 disinfection tests the inactivation profiles of total and ampr e coli were evaluated both in secondary effluent ph 7 5 0 1 and as a comparison in nacl 0 9 solution 0 9 saline solution ph 6 2 0 1 with no bioavailable carbon and free of suspended solids in this medium bacteria remained stable because of their totally compatible osmotic cell pressure nacl 0 9 was selected among the various saline solutions as it was successfully been used in previous studies keser et al 2018 lópez briz et

2009 pfa concentration in the final solution was between 9 and 12 wt two initial concentrations 1 2 mg l for paa and 0 5 1 mg l for pfa in 0 9 saline solution 3 4 mg l for paa and 1 2 mg l for pfa in wastewater were used residual disinfectant measurements and microbial analysis were performed on samples withdrawn at defined contact times and transferred to sterile vials pre loaded with 0 1 m

darmstadt germany allowing a measure in a range of 0 01 8 00 mg l paa and 0 01 6 50 mg l pfa in order to evaluate the paa and pfa disinfection efficacy on ampr e coli antibiotic resistance was also investigated by quantifying the mic before and after the treatment to understand if the resistance remained constant or underwent changes during the disinfection process 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 bacterial enumeration total and ampr e coli microbial analyses were performed in triplicate according to the standard membrane filtration method 9222g apha american public health association 2017 each

with amp antibiotic strips oxoid m i c evaluator was performed to measure mic values the strips were marked by a growing antibiotic concentration that corresponds to the mics in the ampicillin strips the mic range was 0 015 256 μg ml a calibration line with mcfarland turbidity standards was constructed for the test the standard 0 5 mcfarland was prepared with 0 5 ml of 0 048 m bacl2 1 175 wt vol

e coli colonies grown on cca supplemented with 16 mg l of amp were placed in 0 9 saline solution until the measured turbidity reached the value of 0 5 mcfarland which corresponded to a concentration of 1 5 108 cfu ml the solutions were spread homogeneously with sterile tampon in muller hinton agar plates merck kgaa and amp strips were placed on the surface of the media the plates were incubated for 24 h at 37 c the procedure was repeated in duplicate ampr e coli growth became visible near the inhibition halo formed around the strips the point at which the inhibition eclipse began to intersect the strips corresponded to the value of the mic 2 4 models 2 4 1 chemical disinfectant decay model when a chemical disinfectant i e paa or pfa is added to wastewater it initially undergoes an instantaneous demand d followed by a first order decay k haas and joffe 1994 haas and karra 1984 described by eq 1 1 c c 0 d k t c 0 d e kt the concentration of disinfectant c mg l at time t min is a function of the initial concentration of disinfectant c0 mg l the disinfectant initial demand d mg l and the first order rate constant k min 1 the integral estimate of the time dependent residual

includes an initial fast inactivation of dispersed microbes followed by a slower inactivation of particles associated microbes also known as tailing effect santoro et al 2015 this biphasic behavior of microbial inactivation can be described by the sum of 2 exponential terms double exponential model each corresponding to dispersed and particles associated phases recently a term m was added to the double exponential model to account for shoulder effects observed at low ict doses for the inactivation of bacteria by disinfectants manoli et al 2019 the ict based double exponential model is given by eq 4 4 n n 0 β k p k d m ict n 0 1 β e k d ict m n 0 β e k p ict where n0 and n are the initial and final concentrations of culturable microbes respectively in colony forming units cfu 100 ml apart

peracid decay in secondary effluent and in 0 9 saline solution are shown in fig 1 both paa and pfa followed first order decay kinetics k with initial demand d in secondary effluent wastewater paa suffers a decomposition of 21 in 32 min at both initial concentrations of 3 and 4 mg l in the case of pfa a reduction of 29 and 35 in 15 min at initial concentrations of 1 and 2 mg l respectively was observed the determined k values were higher for pfa than paa table 2 the faster decomposition of pfa compared with paa was also observed in combined sewer overflow disinfection experiments chhetri et al 2014 in 0 9 saline solution peracids degradation is lower than in wastewater for instance paa decreased 9 in both concentrations and pfa decreased 10 at 0 5 mg l and 20 at 1 mg l the higher decomposition in wastewater was expected due to side reactions of disinfectants with water contaminants the factors affecting the decomposition rate of peracids in wastewater are its temperature ph the amount of organic material the presence of suspended solids or transition metal ions salinity and water hardness luukkonen and pehkonen 2016 sarathy et al 2016 paa and pfa decompositions were modeled using eq 1 determined d and k are given in table 2 the model could predict well the decomposition of paa and pfa in 0 9 saline solution and wastewater fig 1 3 2 inactivation of total and ampr e coli by paa and pfa the inactivation kinetics of total and ampr e coli by paa and pfa in secondary effluent and in 0 9 saline solution are shown in figs 2 and 3 respectively the ict were calculated using eq 2 in secondary effluent the initial concentration was 6 0 and 5 6 log unit of total and ampr e coli respectively a complete inactivation by paa was observed at ict values of 80 mg min l and 55 mg min l for total and ampr e coli respectively indicating faster inactivation of ampr e coli than total e coli shoulder effects were seen in both cases fig 2a for example ampr e coli removal of half log was observed with paa ict 15 8 mg min l whereas almost one log inactivation was obtained at a paa ict of 30 mg min l results are in agreement with previous studies in wastewater although the concentrations of disinfectant used were higher than ours paa 2 8 mg l time 27 60 min log reduction 2 4 4 dell erba et al 2004 koivunen and heinonen tanski 2005a caretti and lubello 2003 in 0 9 saline solution shoulder effects were seen at paa ict dose up to 8 mg min l being bacteria much more sensitive to inactivation than in wastewater where shoulder effects were observed up to ict of 20 mg min l fig 2 similar inactivation curve of total and ampr e coli by paa was observed in 0 9 saline solution at paa ict of 29 0 mg min l 5 log removal was achieved in the case of pfa a 4 log removal of total e coli was observed at ict of 15 mg min l in secondary effluent fig 3a for ampr e coli 1 and 2 log reductions were achieved at ict of 4 7 and 6 8 mg min l respectively and abatement values below 100 cfu 100 ml were observed at pfa ict of 10 mg min l the faster inactivation of ampr e coli compared to total e coli by pfa in wastewater is consistent with their inactivation by paa figs 2 and 3a in 0 9 saline solution the inactivation of ampr e coli was similar to the total e coli which is consistent with what was observed in the case of paa figs 2b and 3b a 4 log removal was observed at pfa ict of 4 3 mg min l all pfa results showed that most of the bacteria removal took place at ict of 10 mg min l this agrees with other studies where the majority of microorganisms were efficiently inactivated at a concentration of pfa of 2 ppm in 5 min corresponding to an ict of 10 mg min l karpova et al 2013 clearly pfa requires lower ict compared to paa for the same bacteria log reduction in both wastewater and 0 9 saline solution figs 2 and 3 a previous study comparing the disinfecting power of paa and pfa reported that at the same concentration 1 5 mg l and contact time 60 min 1 6 and 3 5 log reductions of total e coli were achieved respectively luukkonen et al 2015 similar observation of faster pfa inactivation compared to paa was reported by other research groups for total e coli and clostridium tyrobutyricum mora et al 2018 ragazzo et al 2013 the aforementioned studies focused on the total e coli to the best of our knowledge this is the first time that paa and pfa are compared in terms of inactivating ampr e coli inactivation curves were characterized by three phases firstly a lag phase at the beginning of the process which represents the shoulder trend indicating an initial resistance to paa diffusion and bacteria inactivation likely due to the action of bacteria antioxidant enzymes that form the first line of defense against free radicals secondly an exponential decay with maximum inactivation rate where the disinfectant penetrates into microbial pathogens generating disruption of cell membranes and blockage of enzymatic and transport systems in the microorganisms finally an asymptotic deceleration phase called tailing where the inactivation rate decreased mezzanotte et al 2007 shoulder effects were observed in all cases figs 2 and 3 however such effect was less pronounced for 0 9 saline solution compared to secondary effluent some studies have concluded that disinfection is dependent on the water quality due to the presence of organic matter in different proportions the 0 9 saline solution and secondary effluent contain different amounts of organic matter solids and initial concentration of bacteria and for that reason in secondary effluent a higher concentration of disinfectant is required to obtain the same disinfection efficiency as in 0 9 saline solution koivunen and heinonen tanski 2005b karpova et al 2013 likewise the larger shoulder effect in secondary effluent was consistent with the inactivation mechanism of the chemical disinfectant that had to diffuse firstly through particles and secondly through the cell membrane during tailing phase inactivation decreased leaving the bacteria that survived to disinfection at even higher ict this occurrence could depend on suspended solids and microbial clumping that protect microbes koivunen and heinonen tanski 2005b according to kacem et al 2014 the tail could be related to the development of bacterial resistance during the disinfection treatment with a phenomenon of inhibition produced by the competitive action of the organic products released into the environment since the 0 9 saline solution is free of suspended solids it is hypothesized that the tailing trend is caused only by an aggregating bacterial tendency bohrerova and linden 2006 mir et al 1997 the bacteria located on the outside of the aggregate were more sensitive to disinfectant s attack and consequently they were inactivated faster whereas the bacteria in the center of the aggregate have a higher survival rate and therefore these bacteria can be found and quantified during the tailing phase domínguez henao et al 2018 in wastewater kinetic curves total e coli and ampr e coli showed a starting tailing at paa ict of 80 and 60 mg min l respectively while in 0 9 saline solution a final tailing phase was observed at paa ict slightly higher than 20 mg min l with pfa the tailing phase began in an ict range between 10 and 15 mg min l in wastewater compared with ict values of 7 mg min l in 0 9 saline solution in general lower ict was required in 0 9 saline solution compared to secondary effluent to achieve the same inactivation of both total and ampr e coli as mentioned the disinfection is dependent on the water quality i e ph bacterial aggregation and suspended solids that characterize the two aqueous matrices the ph value of secondary effluent was about 7 5 the initial ph of 0 9 saline solution was 6 2 adding paa at 1 and 2 ppm reduced the ph at the values of 5 3 and 4 8 respectively while the ph decreased to 4 9 and 4 5 respectively with 0 5 and 1 mg l of pfa lower ph of 0 9 saline solution probably caused the enhancement in terms of inactivation the presence of suspended solids in wastewater may also play a role in the slower inactivation in wastewater than 0 9 saline solution in the absence of suspended solids domínguez henao et al 2018 reported negative impact of suspended solids on disinfection of total e coli by paa because of their protective role on bacteria in all cases the double exponential model eq 4 in the ict domain fitted very well the data figs 2 and 3 the determined microbial inactivation kinetic parameters are given in table 3 the values of β and m agreed with previous results of sarathy et al 2016 β 0 0011 and m 2 27 3 3 inactivation of indigenous ampr e coli by pfa experiments with real concentration of indigenous ampr e coli were performed to investigate their inactivation by pfa and to rule out a possible effect of the inoculum results of inactivation of indigenous total and ampr e coli are presented in fig 4 initial indigenous total and ampr e coli concentrations were 4 8 and 4 4 log unit respectively the kinetic curves were represented as a function of time fig 4a and c and as a function of ict fig 4b and d indigenous bacteria followed the same trend as the inoculated population two different curves were observed when the concentration of total or ampr e coli was plotted as a function of contact time for two different concentrations of pfa fig 4a and c when the x axis was corrected for ict dose eq 2 a single curve could fit the data at both initial concentrations of pfa i e ict dose response fig 4b and d the same kinetic parameters were used for time curves eq 5 and ict based curves eq 4 table 4 compared to pfa tests with inoculated e coli the β and k d values were greater while k p and m were lower this indicates that in real wastewater there was a higher particle associated fraction of total and ampr e coli β and lower shoulder effects m it could be hypothesized that the smaller m value was associated with less bacterial aggregation considering that in the inoculated wastewater effluent the order of magnitude of bacteria was 106 cfu 100 ml compared to only 104 cfu 100 ml of indigenous bacteria in any case through this experimental test it could be affirmed that indigenous bacteria had the same behavior as those inoculated in wastewater both indigenous and inoculated bacteria can be fitted to the ict model and this was consistent for both total and ampr e coli the ict based kinetic model could predict the inactivation of e coli as a function of time as well as a function of ict to guarantee an adequate performance of the disinfection process it is important to check the quality of the effluent and the dose of disinfectant to be used according to the contact time the use of the model can be a fundamental control strategy that responds to variations during disinfection in real time manoli et al 2019 ict model can have practical implications in designing a disinfection system for example the ict dose response can be used to select an ict to achieve desired disinfection performance i e final concentration of microbes 3 4 resistance assay of e coli in secondary effluent the ar of indigenous e coli was calculated as a ratio of number of bacteria grown while exposed to 16 mg l of ampicillin to bacteria grown without antibiotic the ar was 38 6 which agrees with previous studies reporting ar from 34 to 47 luczkiewicz et al 2010 huang et al 2012 after 16 min of contact time the ar of indigenous bacteria decreased from 38 6 to 30 4 and 25 for 1 and 2 mg l of pfa respectively the inoculum increased the number of total e coli and ampr e coli from 4 4 to 4 8 to up to 5 6 6 0 log unit for the non inoculated and the inoculated secondary effluent respectively due to the increased amount of ampr e coli an increase of percentage of residual resistance was observed for the augmented wastewater samples with values between 40 and 88 in the saline solution the inoculation led to ar of 85 in the all tested samples although a variation of initial ar was achieved in the inoculated samples a reduction in ar between 68 3 and 93 3 for paa and greater than 85 4 for pfa was observed in the points corresponding to the tailing phase fig 5 for example in wastewater the ar decreased from 40 to 2 7 at 3 mg l of paa and contact time of 16 min treatment with pfa resulted in a reduction of ar from 93 9 to 3 5 at 1 mg l of pfa reduction of ar was also observed in 0 9 saline solution for both paa and pfa fig 5 compares the ar before the disinfection treatment the ar reached observed at the tailing phase and the respective reduction in antibiotic resistance among the major determinants of b lactam antibiotic resistance there are the b lactamase enzymes that can be transferred by resistant bacteria occurring in wastewater to indigenous aquatic bacteria through plasmids or other mobile genetic elements generally in wwtp the high concentration of bacteria nutrients and in particular suspended solids are all elements that favor horizontal gene transfer guardabassi and dalsgaardand 2002 and consequently could induce an increase in arb concentrations chlorine based disinfectants can increase the percentage of arbs al jassim et al 2015 compared the degree of resistance to various antibiotics including ampicillin among the isolated bacteria from wastewaters treated with chlorine reporting that the ar increased by 28 after chlorination ferreira da silva et al 2007 showed that resistance to antibiotics amoxicillin ciprofloxacin tetracycline and cephalothin in escherichia spp isolates increased by 5 10 in treated wastewater compared to untreated wastewater these studies suggest that chlorination promoted the enrichment and selection of arbs the reduction of ar by paa and pfa observed herein is important since this is a major challenge for wwtp using chlorine based disinfectants in wastewater among the ampr e coli that survived the treatments the mic was analyzed to determine if the amp concentration to which e coli was resistant underwent variations the results showed that the resistance remained constant at mic values 256 μg ml of amp in all the following pfa ict values 0 2 0 4 7 1 7 6 mg min l and paa ict of 0 5 0 9 29 31 1 mg min l results suggest that in the presence of paa and pfa the resistant bacteria became weaker further investigations are needed to understand how these disinfectants act on β lactamases and on other ampicillin resistance genes 3 5 prediction of continuous flow disinfection performance the chemical and microbial inactivation kinetic parameters determined herein in batch lab scale experiments in wastewater tables 2 and 3 were used to simulate the reduction of total and ampr e coli under realistic continuous flow conditions the same concentration after the initial demand was used for both paa and pfa i e c0 d 2 mg l considering that the disinfection of wastewater usually takes place in a continuous flow reactor the hydraulics of the reactor should be considered when trying to predict the disinfection performance the ict dose for a continuous flow reactor is a function of its hydraulic behavior eq 3 two cases were studied i e ideal pfr n 10 and a poor hydraulics reactor n 1 eq 6 was applied to predict the concentration of total and ampr e coli at the outlet n of a continuous flow reactor as a function of contact time i e hydraulic residence time hrt which is the volume of the reactor v over the water flow q results are presented in fig 6 in all cases the difference between ideal and non ideal hydraulics was more obvious at high hrts for example the greatest difference between ideal nn 10 and non ideal nn 1 hydraulics for paa inactivation of total e coli was determined at hrt of 45 min where nn 1 was around 5 times higher than nn 10 fig 6a such difference in concentration of total e coli at the outlet of the reactor due to different hydraulics may have practical implications in meeting the regulations for disinfection of secondary effluent wastewater in the case of paa inactivation of ampr e coli lower hrts were required for the same log removal compared to total e coli which agrees with results obtained in batch experiments fig 2a b 6a and 6b for ampr e coli the difference in n between ideal and non ideal reactor was not that important i e the biggest difference was observed at hrt of 25 min where the nn 1 was around 2 5 times higher than nn 10 fig 6b shorter hrts were required by pfa than paa fig 6 this was expected due to the faster microbial inactivation kinetics of pfa compared to paa figs 2 3 and 6 and table 3 for example an hrt of 45 min and 9 min was needed by paa and pfa respectively to achieve a concentration of total e coli at the outlet of the reactor of around 100 cfu 100 ml in the case of ampr e coli the required hrt was lower i e 5 min and 32 min for pfa and paa respectively the fast kinetics of pfa resulted in overall less effect of hydraulics than the effect seen for paa for both total and ampr e coli fig 6 the concentration of total and ampr e coli at the outlet of the reactor under poor hydraulics nn 1 was at maximum around 2 times higher than ideal hydraulics nn 10 in the case of pfa fig 6c and d results obtained herein through the modeling of a continuous flow reactor under realistic conditions may have practical implications in designing paa and pfa disinfection processes the prediction of the concentration of total and ampr e coli at the outlet of the reactor as a function of hrt under ideal pfr and poor hydraulics conditions is important in directing operators on the optimization of the process of chemical disinfection this may result in environmental and economic benefits 4 conclusions based on the results and discussions illustrated above the following conclusions could be made the assay of ampicillin resistance revealed that sensitive and resistant e coli were affected by paa and pfa in a similar manner the ar was decreased by both paa and pfa indicating a great potential of the proposed chemical disinfectants in controlling antibiotic resistance in wastewater mic analysis showed that resistant e coli maintained the same level of amp resistance 256 μg ml during treatment with paa or pfa in wastewater making these disinfectants attractive alternatives to chlorine in all conditions tested pfa was more effective than paa in secondary effluent wastewater complete log removal was achieved with pfa ict of 15 mg min l compared to paa ict of 60 mg min l the double exponential microbial inactivation kinetic model predicted well the inactivation of total and ampr e coli by paa and pfa the continuous disinfection flow model extended in this study to antibiotic resistant e coli is a powerful tool which can be used to derive useful information for sizing paa and pfa disinfection system under realistic hydraulic conditions

18354,membrane filtration is a rapidly expanding choice for drinking water treatment unfortunately there is limited data on long term changes in the membranes performance as they age the present research investigated changes in performance factors as well as chemical characteristics for hollow fibre ultrafiltration membranes that ranged in age from 8 full scale drinking water treatment plants membranes were harvested by plant operators regularly and analyzed using standardized laboratory tests approximately half of the membranes were a new pvdf based chemistry these were observed to have insignificant changes in performance factors and chemical characteristics since their beginning of operation however because these membranes were newer only data for the first 5 years of operation was available the other half of the membranes with an older pvdf based chemistry were observed to have stable behaviour until approximately 5 years of operation after this time performance factors and chemical characteristics of the membranes began to change significantly for these membranes the clean water resistance and fouling rate increased after 5 years of operation the mechanical properties of these membranes also deteriorated after 5 years of operation suggesting that their susceptibility to breach is higher after prolonged use these changes in performance factors paralleled and were possibly caused by the removal of hydrophilic additives from the membrane material clean water resistance was identified as a good benchmark for all the parameters studied a finding that is useful for water treatment facilities in quickly assessing the status of their membranes finally although cumulative exposure dose c t was not used as a metric of membrane age we observed that when higher doses of hypochlorite were applied all metrics changed faster than expected based only on years of operation therefore limiting the magnitude of the cumulative hypochlorite dose is essential in managing membrane deterioration this research illuminates the knowledge gap between bench scale ageing studies and operational water treatment plants graphical abstract image 1 keywords water treatment plants membrane ageing ultrafiltration hypochlorite dose performance factors full scale ageing 1 introduction 1 1 background research gap ultrafiltration membrane filtration hereafter simply referred to as membrane filtration is a popular technology for drinking water treatment however there is limited data surrounding long term changes that can occur as membranes age ageing results from operational stresses induced on membranes during repeated permeation and cleaning eventually membrane replacement is required robinson et al 2016 an improved understanding of membrane ageing in full scale water treatment plants would allow for more predictable long term operation and capital planning membrane fouling results from the accumulation of retained material both inside the pores and on the surface of membranes during filtration and increases the resistance to permeate flow various hydraulic cleaning strategies are employed to minimize and or reverse membrane fouling crittenden 2005 a common strategy employed to periodically remove foulants is backwashing of membranes with clean water this allows some of the foulants within membrane pores and on the membrane surface to be transported away from the membrane shear is typically introduced via air sparging or cross flow during backwashing to enhance the transport of material away from the membrane surface however after repeated filtration and backwash cycles chemical cleaning is required to remove material which has adsorbed onto the membrane and which cannot be removed hydraulically for ultrafiltration membranes cleaning is generally done with hypochlorite crittenden 2005 long term exposure to foulants and cleaning agents has been reported to irreversibly change the performance and characteristics of membranes these irreversible changes define a phenomenon termed membrane ageing despite considerable research on membrane fouling and cleaning ageing of membranes has received less attention robinson et al 2016 1 2 defining membrane performance factors five performance factors have been reported to deteriorate as membranes age robinson et al 2016 these performance factors are clean membrane resistance fouling rate cleaning rate susceptibility to breach and infrastructure reliability most ageing studies to date have been performed with a bench scale accelerated aging approach this is due to the timeline needed to observe changes under operational conditions the clean membrane resistance is a metric of how much pressure is required to produce a given flow through a membrane in bench scale ageing studies a decrease in clean membrane resistance is generally observed for pvdf based membranes aged via an extended single soak in naocl abdullah and bérubé 2013 hajibabania et al 2012 le clech 2014 however an increase in resistance has been observed in bench scale ageing studies when membranes were cycled i e repeated filtration followed by cleaning with naocl during ageing hajibabania et al 2012 he et al 2014 wang et al 2010 the resistance likely decreases during single soak ageing due to pore expansion from membrane degradation and increases during cycled ageing due to irreversible fouling robinson et al 2016 the membrane fouling rate quantifies how rapidly the resistance increases during a permeation cycle due to fouling most bench scale ageing studies report an increase in fouling rate as membrane age abdullah and bérubé 2013 arkhangelsky et al 2008 gaudichet maurin and thominette 2006 levitsky et al 2012 2011 qin et al 2004 2003 it has been hypothesized that during operation aged membranes become more hydrophobic as hydrophilic additives are removed causing them to foul more readily abdullah and bérubé 2013 gaudichet maurin and thominette 2006 qin et al 2004 2003 additives are commonly blended into pvdf based membranes to increase hydrophilicity abdullah and bérubé 2013 the membrane cleaning rate which reflects how readily permeability can be recovered during chemical cleaning is a potentially important performance factor for two reasons when this rate decreases the time required to chemically clean the membrane increases resulting in substantial operational downtime also extending the duration of chemical cleaning increases the overall exposure dose in one bench scale study chemical cleaning was observed to be less effective for older membranes abdullah and bérubé 2013 during full scale operation membrane breaches occasionally occur compromising the treatment efficacy the membrane susceptibility to breach cannot be assessed directly as a performance factor because breaches are rare and discrete events however mechanical properties are often used as surrogates robinson et al 2016 in general pvdf membranes break more easily as they age hajibabania et al 2012 wang et al 2010 aside from ageing of the membranes themselves the supporting infrastructure e g potting casing spacers etc can also degrade or break over time infrastructure reliability is manufacturer specific and independent of the membrane material itself for this reason it is generally not considered in ageing studies 1 3 standard ageing procedures benchtop accelerated ageing studies bench scale ageing indicate that chemical cleaning negatively impacts long term membrane performance robinson et al 2016 most studies focus on naocl induced ageing as this is the most common cleaning agent unfortunately accelerated bench scale ageing cannot effectively replicate the nuances or timescales of field operated membranes full scale ageing the complexity that can be considered at bench scale is limited water quality suites of cleaning procedures and hydraulic conditions add variability that experiments usually strive to minimize most bench scale studies age membranes via a single soak in a concentrated cleaning solution single soak ageing however ageing with repeated cycles of filtration and cleaning to achieve bench scale ageing cycled ageing may better simulate full scale ageing unfortunately only a limited number of bench scale studies have considered cycled ageing arkhangelsky et al 2008 2007 causserand et al 2008 hajibabania et al 2012 additionally the concentration of the cleaning agent i e naocl used in bench scale ageing both single soak and cycled is typically 10 to 1000 times higher than that used in full scale ageing to reduce study time abdullah and bérubé 2013 abdullah and bérubé examined the applicability of the widely used concept of c t concentration of cleaning agent exposure duration as a metric to characterize the impact of naocl exposure on membranes abdullah and bérubé 2013 they reported that ageing is more sensitive to exposure duration than concentration so accelerated bench scale ageing performed with high concentration of naocl may be underestimating long term negative impacts on membrane performance a limited number of studies have investigated full scale ageing in membrane systems keucken et al observed polyetherssulfone pes membrane over a 1 year period in an operational water treatment plant unfortunately the time period considered was too short to observe changes in membrane performance keucken et al 2016 he et al observed decreasing permeability over a 3 year period for polyvinylidene difluoride based pvdf based membranes operated in a drinking water application he et al 2014 fenu et al reported permeability decline in pvdf based membranes over a 10 year period in an mbr fenu et al 2012 most studies to date have focused on pvdf based membranes as pvdf is currently the dominant membrane chemistry utilized in drinking water treatment applications pearce 2017 although these studies provide insight into full scale ageing they a measured only limited performance factors b included only a short timeframe during which other parameters were measured and c only considered one full scale membrane treatment system to build on this existing work the field of membrane field ageing would benefit from performance factor data beyond permeability for multi year timescales analysis of membrane characteristics to explain performance changes and data from a variety of water treatment facilities to control for plant specific variation in water quality operation etc 1 4 objectives the primary objective of the present work was to determine which performance factors change over many years of full scale ageing this was achieved via collaboration with 8 canadian membrane facilities we hypothesized that performance outcomes similar to those observed in accelerated bench scale cycled ageing would be reflected in field aged membranes an increase in fouling rate and clean membrane resistance and a decrease in cleaning rate and a deterioration of membrane mechanical properties we also hypothesized that changes in the chemical characteristics of full scale aged membranes would provide a basis for explaining the observed changes in performance for example the amount of hydrophilic additives present in a membrane matrix have been observed to decline in bench scale aged membranes resulting in greater fouling abdullah and bérubé 2013 we anticipate that the same causal relationships would hold for field aged membranes from the observations of full scale aged membranes a further objective of the present work was to establish a practical means of benchmarking operational performance of membranes for use in membrane facilities a related objective was to assess the applicability of the c t dose commonly used at bench scale to quantify membrane ageing to ageing in full scale facilities 2 methods materials 2 1 full scale membrane harvesting membranes were harvested from 14 different trains at 8 partner membrane facilities i e water treatment facilities these facilities were selected because they all utilize similar membranes pvdf based zw1000 from suez water technologies solutions oakville canada the operational age of the membranes in the different trains at the facilities ranged in age from 0 years to 8 3 years a train refers to a group of membranes that operate simultaneously so they experience the same conditions over time operational age was used as the principal metric by which performance factors and chemical characteristics for the different trains were compared information on cumulative exposure dose i e c t to naocl was available for 5 of the facilities the relationship between operational age and cumulative expose dose for these facilities is discussed in section 3 4 at some facilities multiple trains of different ages were harvested the partner facilities from which fibres were harvested for the present study were as listed in table 1 among the 14 membrane trains two types of pvdf based membranes were identified based on physical and chemical characterization the specifications of the two membrane types are provided in table 2 though both are made primarily from pvdf they contain slightly different hydrophilic additives has the two types of pvdf membranes were therefore considered independently in the analysis because the has are proprietary the two types of membranes are simply identified here as 1000a newer current market product and 1000b older previous market product the target membrane harvesting frequency was twice per year though the actual harvesting frequency varied at some partner facilities due to operational constraints membrane fibres were harvested immediately after extensive recovery cleaning so that only irreversible foulants were considered to be present the harvested membrane fibres were shipped to the university of british columbia ubc where they were stored in distilled water with approximately 2 ppm naocl at 4 c until analysis 2 2 measurement of performance factors for full scale aged membranes 2 2 1 test module specifications for each full scale membrane harvesting event duplicate test modules were made using the harvested fibres in order to carry out bench scale performance testing either 5 for 1000a membranes or 7 for 1000b membranes membrane fibres were used for each module the top ends of the fibres were potted into rigid ¼ tubing using epoxy ensuring that individual fibres were not blocked the bottom ends of the fibres were sealed and potted with epoxy the modules were pressure tested at 55 kpa 8 psi to ensure the integrity of the seal before and after performance testing compromised modules were repaired with epoxy whenever possible or discarded test module preparation and membrane specifications are given in table 2 2 2 2 experimental setup three bench scale experimental setups fig 1 were built to assess the performance factors for full scale aged test modules each experimental setup included 4 membrane modules allowing for a total of 12 tests modules to be operated simultaneously the feed tanks 30 l and backwash tanks 30 l were located above the filtration tanks enabling gravity driven flow through timer controlled solenoid valves mcmaster carr 5489t491 the membrane tanks each 400 ml drained via gravity through timer controlled solenoid valves the peristaltic permeation and backwash pumps masterflex were also timer controlled pressure was monitored for all membrane modules using pressure transducers range 15 psig and recorded using labview signalexpress software the permeate flow was measured gravimetrically and was constant for the pressures encountered 2 2 3 performance assessment of full scale aged membranes prior to assessments membrane test modules were again cleaned by permeating with distilled water and then soaking overnight in an naocl solution ph 10 500 ppm after soaking the clean membrane resistance was determined by filtering distilled water square in fig 2 for 30 min and measuring the temperature flow rate and trans membrane pressure performance testing of the membrane test modules began with clean water resistance measurement as discussed above and then repeatedly cycled through a series of 30 min filtration circles in fig 2 and 30 min chemical enhanced backwash ceb cycles triangles in fig 2 both at 50 l m2h a model foulant solution was used for filtration and a naocl solution was used for the ceb the model foulant contained humic acid sigma aldrich sodium alginate sigma aldrich and bovine serum albumin sigma aldrich in a 2 1 1 mass ratio this composition was selected to represent a broad spectrum of natural organic matter nom foulants hajibabania et al 2012 these constituents were dissolved in tap water with characteristics as follows ph 7 0 7 4 hardness 6 2 9 9 mg l as caco3 alkalinity 4 6 8 9 mg l as caco3 and toc 0 5 1 0 mg l gvwd 2016 the total organic carbon toc of the model foulant solution was 10 mg l for performance testing of 1000a test modules and 5 mg l for 1000b test modules the different toc concentrations were selected to achieve relatively similar fouling rates for the 1000a and 1000b test modules estimated based on preliminary testing the fouling rates were quantified based on the slope of the change in trans membrane pressure tmp during the 2nd 3rd and 4th fouling cycles the fouling rate during the 1st cycles were consistently greater than those observed in the other cycles all of which had similar fouling rates for this reason steady operational conditions were assumed to exist for cycles 2 through 4 fig 2 the chemical enhanced backwash ceb solution contained 500 ppm naocl adjusted to ph 10 using hcl this ceb solution is typical of that used in periodic recovery cleans at the partner facilities from which fibres were harvested for our study after 4 repeated filtration and ceb cycles membranes test modules were again soaked overnight in 500 ppm naocl after which the clean membrane resistance was again determined as previously described following performance testing the membrane test modules were stored as previously described until further analysis prior to characterisation section 2 3 the membrane test modules were again rinsed with 500 ppm naocl followed by distilled water 2 3 chemical physical characterisation of full scale aged membranes membrane coupons 8 cm from each hollow fibre were harvested from the test modules and dried overnight at 50 c prior to chemical and physical characterisation the analyses performed are briefly presented below with specific operational details presented elsewhere robinson 2018 attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared atr ftir spectra were collected using a thermo nicolet nexus 670 ft ir raman spectrometer with a diamond window and resolution of 2 cm 1 blank and baseline correction were performed within omnic software across the range of interest 700 to 2000 cm 1 this window includes characteristic peaks for pvdf 1402 cm 1 and ha 1728 cm 1 for 1000a 1748 cm 1 for 1000b as well as the fingerprint region peak integration ranges were determined based on peak shape from composite spectra compiled from all membranes for all membrane samples duplicate ftir spectra were collected for each replicate sample i e 8 per sampling condition and the ha pvdf peak area ratios were calculated the peak ratios do not give a quantitative ha content however when normalized against the pvdf peak which is known to be stable for the conditions investigated the relative ha content can be assessed abdullah and bérubé 2013 example ftir spectra for 1000a and 1000b membranes are presented in the supplementary material proton spectra were collected using a 400 mhz bruker nuclear magnetic resonance nmr spectrometer with 128 scans dried membrane coupons 0 4 g were dissolved in dmso d 6 0 7 ml aided by sonication and mild heating 50 c for 15 min the triplet peak at 2 9 ppm was integrated as a relative reference for pvdf content the minor peak at 2 25 ppm corresponds to irregularly polymerized pvdf and was ignored the peak ratio is not an exact representation of the polymer ratio because the proton fraction in ha versus pvdf differs for this reason the peak ratio was compared to virgin or newest membranes in the analysis example nmr spectra for 1000a and 1000b membranes are presented in the supplementary material tensile testing was considered as a surrogate for susceptibility to breach tensile testing was performed using a modified version of the astm standard test method for tensile properties of single textile fibers d3822 astm 2014 briefly a 3 5 cm membrane coupon was held with 2 5 cm exposed between grips on kes g1 multi purpose tensile tester equipped with a 5 kg load cell depending on breakpoint elongation fibres were stretched at a rate of 0 2 mm s elongation of 100 most 1000bs or 1 mm s elongation of 100 most 1000as as per astm d3822 eight replicates were performed per harvesting event 4 from each test module the maximum stress and young s modulus were plotted as relevant to an individual fibre rather than per cross sectional area example stress strain curves are presented in the supplementary material 2 4 data analysis linear regression was used to determine the relationship between performance factors or characteristics and membrane operational age expressed in years all 1000a membranes had been operational for less than 5 years or half of their recommended life so were analyzed together the 1000b membranes ranged from 3 to 8 3 years and were analyzed as newer 1000b membranes 5 years of operation and older 1000b membranes 5 years of operation the p values presented in this manuscript relate to the null hypothesis that the slope of each trend equals zero for a linear relationship between a measured variable and the membrane age where p values suggested a linear relationship between variables the slope and 95 confidence interval of the trend line are presented a similar statistical approach was performed to link the surface ha content to the fouling rate testing for a non zero slope detailed statistical analysis for the different conditions considered is presented in the supplementary material both the extent of cleaning during a given period and the cleaning rate correlated closely with the fouling rate for 1000a and 1000b membranes see supplementary material this was expected because cleaning is greatly impacted by the amount of foulant present on the membrane prior to cleaning because the extent and rate of cleaning do not provide additional insight into our understanding of membrane ageing it is not discussed further details of the analysis relating to the extent and rate of cleaning are provided in the supplementary material 3 results discussion 3 1 effect of ageing on performance factors four performance factors as previously described were assessed for fibres harvested from full scale membrane facilities clean membrane resistance fouling rate cleaning rate susceptibility to breach robinson et al 2016 clean membrane resistance and fouling rate were assessed via clean water resistance tests and permeation tests respectively susceptibility to breach was assessed indirectly via tensile testing clean membrane resistance fouling rate and tensile testing observations are presented in figs 3 5 respectively data relating to each performance factor have been segregated into 1000a membranes left side of each figure and 1000b membranes right side of each figure all three membrane performance factors the clean membrane resistance fig 3a fouling rate fig 4a and all three indicators of susceptibility to breach percent elongation at break maximum stress and young s modulus fig 5a c and 5e respectively were observed to be remain unchanged for 1000a membranes with less than 5 years of operation unfortunately no data is available for 1000a membranes with more than approximately 5 years of operation further research is required to assess the impact of age on performance factors for this newer market product and to compare to the results for the 1000b membranes below note that the magnitudes of performance factors should not be compared directly for the two membrane types as they are different products with slightly different chemical and physical characteristics see table 2 all three membrane performance factors the clean membrane resistance fig 3b fouling rate fig 4b and all three indicators of susceptibility to breach percent elongation at break maximum stress and young s modulus fig 5b d and 5f respectively were also observed to be remain unchanged for 1000b membranes with less than 5 years of operation however all three membrane performance factors were observed to change significantly for 1000b membranes with more than 5 years of operation as illustrated in fig 3b the clean membrane resistance was higher and more variable for older 1000b membranes than for newer 1000b membranes the magnitude of the clean membrane resistance increased with membrane age beyond 5 years the fouling rate was also higher for the older 1000b membranes and increased in magnitude with membrane age beyond 5 years as illustrated in fig 4b for 1000b membranes greater than 5 years of age the percent elongation at break increased while the maximum stress and young s modulus decreased with membrane age fig 5b 5d and 5f respectively most bench scale single soak accelerated ageing studies of pvdf membranes have reported a decrease in membrane resistance with age abdullah and bérubé 2013 hajibabania et al 2012 le clech 2014 these studies attributed the reduction in resistance to an increase in membrane pore size caused by ageing the general explanation is that prolonged exposure to naocl cleaning agent causes removal of additives e g ha resulting in an opening of the membrane pore structure abdullah and bérubé 2013 arkhangelsky et al 2007 hajibabania et al 2012 jung et al 2004 pellegrin et al 2015 however in bench scale studies where cycled accelerated ageing was applied i e repeated fouling and cleaning an increase in resistance with age has been reported hajibabania et al 2012 he et al 2014 wang et al 2010 the increase in resistance observed in the present study was attributed to an accumulation of irreversible foulants on the membrane the increase in the magnitude and variability of the clean water resistance observed in the present study after 5 years of operation for the 1000b membranes at full scale is consistent with the results reported by others for cycled ageing studies suggesting that the resistance increase at full scale is due to irreversible fouling similar fouling rate results have been reported by others for both single soak ageing and cycled ageing studies these studies have reported an increase in fouling rate with age abdullah and bérubé 2013 gaudichet maurin and thominette 2006 qin et al 2004 2003 this increase in fouling rate is usually attributed to an decrease in membrane surface hydrophilicity with age as ha s are removed the impact of age on ha content is further discussed in section 3 2 abdullah and bérubé 2013 arkhangelsky et al 2008 gaudichet maurin and thominette 2006 levitsky et al 2012 2011 qin et al 2004 2003 the increase in fouling rate observed in the present study after 5 years of for the 1000b membranes at full scale is consistent with the increase in fouling rate reported by others for single soak and cycled ageing studies though magnitudes cannot be compared due to variation in foulant type and testing protocol the tensile testing results from the present study indicate that aged 1000b membranes are more ductile similar results have been reported previously wang et al 2010 though others have reported decreasing elongation with age hajibabania et al 2012 le clech 2014 the observed maximum stress at break indicates that aged 1000b membranes are weaker similar results have been reported for bench scale aged membranes in two prior studies hajibabania et al 2012 wang et al 2010 the elasticity results indicate that aged 1000b membranes are more readily deformed with age a decreasing young s modulus has also been observed by others for bench scale aged membranes wang et al 2010 mechanical deterioration has been attributed to change in crystallinity of the pvdf as additives are removed around the pvdf molecules hashim et al 2011 however the mechanism behind the deterioration of mechanical properties is not well understood and was beyond the scope of the present research nonetheless the observed changes in mechanical properties suggest that aged membranes may be more susceptible to breach than newer membranes 3 2 effect of ageing on membrane characteristics similar trends to those observed for the performance factors were also observed for the membrane chemical characteristics two analytical techniques atr ftir spectroscopy and nmr spectroscopy were used to quantify the amount of hydrophilic additive ha present on the membrane surfaces and in the membrane bulk respectively atr ftir and nmr observations are presented in figs 6 and 7 data relating to each characteristic have been segregated into 1000a membranes left side of each figure and 1000b membranes right side of each figure the membrane surface ha content assessed via atr ftir decreased slightly fig 6a and the bulk ha content assessed via nmr was observed to be remain unchanged fig 7a for 1000a membranes ranging from 0 to 5 years of operation though decrease in ha surface content was statistically significant it amounted to less than 10 surface ha being removed over 5 years so was a small effect as previously discussed no data is available for 1000a membranes with more than approximately 5 years of operation to gain insight into the stability of ha for 1000a membranes beyond a 5 year period an ad hoc single soak bench scale accelerated ageing test was performed new1000a membranes were soaked in a 5000 ppm solution of naocl at ph 10 for 16 days equivalent to a dose of 2 000 000 ppm h based on this test 35 of the ha content was removed from 1000a membrane surface atr ftir analysis and 22 from the bulk nmr analysis these results indicate that the ha content of full scale 1000a membranes is expected to decrease in a manner similar to that observed for the 1000b membranes this suggests that the performance factors are also expected to change in a manner similar to those observed for the 1000b membranes beyond a 5 year period continued characterization of the performance factors and chemical characteristics of membranes aged at full scale is recommended for both the 1000a and 1000b membranes both chemical characteristics the surface ha content fig 6b and the bulk ha content fig 7b were constant with respect to membrane age for 1000b membranes with less than 5 years of operation however both chemical characteristics were observed to change significantly for 1000b membranes with more than 5 years of operation for 1000b membranes greater than 5 years of age the surface ha content was lower than for those less than 5 years of age the magnitude of the surface ha content decreased with membrane age p 0 007 as illustrated in 6b for 1000b membranes greater than 5 years of age the bulk ha content was lower than for those less than 5 years of age the magnitude of the bulk ha content decreased with membrane age p 0 018 as illustrated in fig 7b statistical analyses are presented in the supplementary material to better understand membrane degradation bulk and surface ha pvdf ratios were compared as presented in fig 8 ha content was compared to assess whether removal is preferentially from the membrane surface of the bulk the bulk and surface ha content was generally lower for aged 1000b membranes figs 6b and 7b respectively as illustrated in fig 8b the results indicate that although the removal of ha occurred throughout the membrane matrix surface ha may have been initially preferrentially removed but that bulk ha was removed to a greater extent as membranes aged this trend is illustrated with a curved arrow fig 8b though it was beyond the scope of the present work to establish a model for this phenomenon although the mechanism of ha removal was not investigated in the present work others have observed that ha in membranes with 1000b type chemistry is oxidized by naocl abdullah and bérubé 2013 the oxidation products are soluble and are therefore released from the membrane matrix for 1000a membranes bulk and surface ha content remained relatively constant figs 6a and 7a respectively and as ilustrated in fig 8a the bulk and surface ha content are clustered together regardless of membrane age however as previously discussed the ha content of the 1000a membranes is expected to change in a manner similar to that observed for the 1000b membranes as the number of years of operation increases 3 3 linking performance factors to characteristics potential links between changes in performance factors and membrane characteristics were assessed to better understand the ageing phenomena because there was no significant change in the performance factors or chemical characteristics of 1000a membranes for the range of membrane ages available i e less than 5 years old the following analysis is based only on data for the 1000b membranes of all ages many studies have suggested that the ha content of pvdf membranes directly impacts the membrane fouling rate robinson et al 2016 the fouling rate with respect to the surface ha content is presented in fig 9 the fouling rate was significantly higher for 1000b membranes with lower ha content on the membrane surface these results support the concept that as the surface ha content decreases more hydrophobic membranes have a higher affinity for organic foulants 3 4 identifying benchmarks for operational water treatment plants to adapt the findings of the present study for use by operational facilities we sought to identify a convenient metric of membrane ageing for full scale facilities changes were observed in all metrics performance factors and chemical characteristics after about 5 years for 1000b membranes continuous monitoring of all performance factors and characteristics to monitor ageing would not be feasible at full scale facilities the time personnel analysis and harvesting requirements would be onerous however continuous monitoring of resistance and in particular resistance following extensive chemical cleaning is performed at full scale resistance following extensive chemical cleaning is analogous to the clean water resistance performance factor presented here as presented in the supplementary material the clean membrane resistance correlated well with all other metrics as membranes age therefore high resistance following extensive cleaning could be used as an indicator of membrane ageing at full scale facilities the observed change in the various metrics considered with respect to age and with respect to observed clean membrane resistance are summarized in table 3 based on these observations membrane facilities with sustained and irreversible increases in resistance following extensive cleaning should be vigilant of membrane ageing note that all resistance values should be normalized to a standard temperature e g 20 c to account for seasonal changes in temperature 3 5 relationship between age and exposure dose the estimates of the exposure dose c t to naocl compared with operational ages for the 5 facilities for which such data was available are presented in fig 10 note that most of the partner facilities assume that the concentration of naocl in the cleaning solution remains constant during storage and use it should be noted that the naocl concentration is expected to decrease as it reacts with foulants and other material in the membrane tank a strong correlation r2 0 95 was observed between membrane age and reported naocl exposure dose for most facilities however for one facility the cumulative naocl exposure dose was much higher than the others for a given operational age data from this facility are identified by the symbol x in fig 10 as well as in figs 3 7 further investigation revealed that this facility had implemented an atypical i e frequent and aggressive chemical cleaning protocol in an attempt to address operational problems considering the linear relationship between the cumulative exposure dose and operational age it may be possible to estimate an effective age for this atypical facility by identifying the operational age for which the estimated exposure dose intersects this linear relationship fig 10 for the atypical facility the effective age was estimated to be approximately 13 years unfortunately the membranes at the atypical facility were replaced soon after our study commenced so further temporal data were unavailable for this particular train recalling sections 3 1 and 3 2 the clean membrane resistance for membranes from the atypical facility was more than double that from all other facilities fig 3b and fouling rates from this facility were among the greatest observed fig 4b the mechanical properties of membranes from this facility were also poorer than the other facilities in the study fig 5b d f and had the lowest observed ha content both surface and bulk of all figs 6b and 7b respectively the ageing trends in fig 3 through fig 7 included the membranes from the atypical plant at their operational age approximately 8 years however when the performance factors and characteristics for membranes from this atypical facility are plotted with respect to effective age rather than actual age all correlations considered improve significantly as presented in the supplementary material these results indicate that if extensive and frequent chemical cleaning is required for operation beyond what is typical membrane ageing is expected to accelerate thus changes in performance and membrane characteristics are expected to occur earlier and to a greater magnitude in such cases operational protocols should be reviewed to reduce the extent and frequency of chemical cleaning for example by improving or implementing pre treatment 4 conclusions the present research investigated changes in performance factors as well as chemical characteristics of full scale aged ultrafiltration membranes our work illuminates the knowledge gap between results from previous bench scale ageing studies and performance factors and chemical characteristics relevant to operational membrane facilities for 1000a membranes no significant changes in performance or chemical characteristics were observed over the course of the study older 1000a membranes would be necessary to determine whether this stable operation persists but such full scale aged membranes are not yet available results from a single soaked accelerated ageing test of 1000a membranes indicated that ha content of full scale aged 1000a membranes is expected to decrease with sufficient naocl exposure thus we anticipate that performance may also change after long term full scale ageing as observed for the 1000b membranes we observed that the clean membrane resistance of 1000b membranes increased after approximately 5 years of operation increasing resistance is consistent with some bench scale aged membranes that have been cycled with foulant and cleaning agent however our results contradict bench scale ageing using a prolonged single soak in naocl the discrepancy likely stems from the opposing effects of pore enlargement and irreversible fouling on the clean membrane resistance the membrane fouling rate also increased for older membranes consistent with the literature on bench scale ageing though the susceptibility to breach cannot be measured directly three metrics elongation at break maximum stress and young s modulus were all observed to deteriorate with membrane age also in agreement with bench scale ageing both bulk and surface chemistry of the 1000b membranes changed with age after 5 years of operation the hydrophilic additive was observed to decrease in the bulk and on the membrane surface the reduction in ha content likely increases the fouling rate for older membranes as foulants tend to sorb to more hydrophobic surfaces we observed that the clean membrane resistance correlated well with all other performance factors and chemical characteristics studied if a sustained irreversible increase in clean membrane resistance is observed over time plant operators should be cognisant that fouling and achieving sufficient flux may become difficult and that membrane breaches may occur more frequently this finding is useful to water treatment plant operators or managers seeking a metric to assess their infrastructure and for membrane manufacturers in better understanding their products finally although c t was not used as a metric of membrane age we observed that for one plant that applied an atypically high dose of naocl the effective age of the membranes appeared to be greater than their operational age thus as indicated by the results of bench scale studies avoiding excessive cumulative naocl exposure is advised furthermore naocl c t would likely provide a suitable ageing metric for full scale ageing if dose fluctuates over years of operation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

18354,membrane filtration is a rapidly expanding choice for drinking water treatment unfortunately there is limited data on long term changes in the membranes performance as they age the present research investigated changes in performance factors as well as chemical characteristics for hollow fibre ultrafiltration membranes that ranged in age from 8 full scale drinking water treatment plants membranes were harvested by plant operators regularly and analyzed using standardized laboratory tests approximately half of the membranes were a new pvdf based chemistry these were observed to have insignificant changes in performance factors and chemical characteristics since their beginning of operation however because these membranes were newer only data for the first 5 years of operation was available the other half of the membranes with an older pvdf based chemistry were observed to have stable behaviour until approximately 5 years of operation after this time performance factors and chemical characteristics of the membranes began to change significantly for these membranes the clean water resistance and fouling rate increased after 5 years of operation the mechanical properties of these membranes also deteriorated after 5 years of operation suggesting that their susceptibility to breach is higher after prolonged use these changes in performance factors paralleled and were possibly caused by the removal of hydrophilic additives from the membrane material clean water resistance was identified as a good benchmark for all the parameters studied a finding that is useful for water treatment facilities in quickly assessing the status of their membranes finally although cumulative exposure dose c t was not used as a metric of membrane age we observed that when higher doses of hypochlorite were applied all metrics changed faster than expected based only on years of operation therefore limiting the magnitude of the cumulative hypochlorite dose is essential in managing membrane deterioration this research illuminates the knowledge gap between bench scale ageing studies and operational water treatment plants graphical abstract image 1 keywords water treatment plants membrane ageing ultrafiltration hypochlorite dose performance factors full scale ageing 1 introduction 1 1 background research gap ultrafiltration membrane filtration hereafter simply referred to as membrane filtration is a popular technology for drinking water treatment however there is limited data surrounding long term changes that can occur as membranes age ageing results from operational stresses induced on membranes during repeated permeation and cleaning eventually membrane replacement is required robinson et al 2016 an improved understanding of membrane ageing in full scale water treatment plants would allow for more predictable long term operation and capital planning membrane fouling results from the accumulation of retained material both inside the pores and on the surface of membranes during filtration and increases the resistance to permeate flow various hydraulic cleaning strategies are employed to minimize and or reverse membrane fouling crittenden 2005 a common strategy employed to periodically remove foulants is backwashing of membranes with clean water this allows some of the foulants within membrane pores and on the membrane surface to be transported away from the membrane shear is typically introduced via air sparging or cross flow during backwashing to enhance the transport of material away from the membrane surface however after repeated filtration and backwash cycles chemical cleaning is required to remove material which has adsorbed onto the membrane and which cannot be removed hydraulically for ultrafiltration membranes cleaning is generally done with hypochlorite crittenden 2005 long term exposure to foulants and cleaning agents has been reported to irreversibly change the performance and characteristics of membranes these irreversible changes define a phenomenon termed membrane ageing despite considerable research on membrane fouling and cleaning ageing of membranes has received less attention robinson et al 2016 1 2 defining membrane performance factors five performance factors have been reported to deteriorate as membranes age robinson et al 2016 these performance factors are clean membrane resistance fouling rate cleaning rate susceptibility to breach and infrastructure reliability most ageing studies to date have been performed with a bench scale accelerated aging approach this is due to the timeline needed to observe changes under operational conditions the clean membrane resistance is a metric of how much pressure is required to produce a given flow through a membrane in bench scale ageing studies a decrease in clean membrane resistance is generally observed for pvdf based membranes aged via an extended single soak in naocl abdullah and bérubé 2013 hajibabania et al 2012 le clech 2014 however an increase in resistance has been observed in bench scale ageing studies when membranes were cycled i e repeated filtration followed by cleaning with naocl during ageing hajibabania et al 2012 he et al 2014 wang et al 2010 the resistance likely decreases during single soak ageing due to pore expansion from membrane degradation and increases during cycled ageing due to irreversible fouling robinson et al 2016 the membrane fouling rate quantifies how rapidly the resistance increases during a permeation cycle due to fouling most bench scale ageing studies report an increase in fouling rate as membrane age abdullah and bérubé 2013 arkhangelsky et al 2008 gaudichet maurin and thominette 2006 levitsky et al 2012 2011 qin et al 2004 2003 it has been hypothesized that during operation aged membranes become more hydrophobic as hydrophilic additives are removed causing them to foul more readily abdullah and bérubé 2013 gaudichet maurin and thominette 2006 qin et al 2004 2003 additives are commonly blended into pvdf based membranes to increase hydrophilicity abdullah and bérubé 2013 the membrane cleaning rate which reflects how readily permeability can be recovered during chemical cleaning is a potentially important performance factor for two reasons when this rate decreases the time required to chemically clean the membrane increases resulting in substantial operational downtime also extending the duration of chemical cleaning increases the overall exposure dose in one bench scale study chemical cleaning was observed to be less effective for older membranes abdullah and bérubé 2013 during full scale operation membrane breaches occasionally occur compromising the treatment efficacy the membrane susceptibility to breach cannot be assessed directly as a performance factor because breaches are rare and discrete events however mechanical properties are often used as surrogates robinson et al 2016 in general pvdf membranes break more easily as they age hajibabania et al 2012 wang et al 2010 aside from ageing of the membranes themselves the supporting infrastructure e g potting casing spacers etc can also degrade or break over time infrastructure reliability is manufacturer specific and independent of the membrane material itself for this reason it is generally not considered in ageing studies 1 3 standard ageing procedures benchtop accelerated ageing studies bench scale ageing indicate that chemical cleaning negatively impacts long term membrane performance robinson et al 2016 most studies focus on naocl induced ageing as this is the most common cleaning agent unfortunately accelerated bench scale ageing cannot effectively replicate the nuances or timescales of field operated membranes full scale ageing the complexity that can be considered at bench scale is limited water quality suites of cleaning procedures and hydraulic conditions add variability that experiments usually strive to minimize most bench scale studies age membranes via a single soak in a concentrated cleaning solution single soak ageing however ageing with repeated cycles of filtration and cleaning to achieve bench scale ageing cycled ageing may better simulate full scale ageing unfortunately only a limited number of bench scale studies have considered cycled ageing arkhangelsky et al 2008 2007 causserand et al 2008 hajibabania et al 2012 additionally the concentration of the cleaning agent i e naocl used in bench scale ageing both single soak and cycled is typically 10 to 1000 times higher than that used in full scale ageing to reduce study time abdullah and bérubé 2013 abdullah and bérubé examined the applicability of the widely used concept of c t concentration of cleaning agent exposure duration as a metric to characterize the impact of naocl exposure on membranes abdullah and bérubé 2013 they reported that ageing is more sensitive to exposure duration than concentration so accelerated bench scale ageing performed with high concentration of naocl may be underestimating long term negative impacts on membrane performance a limited number of studies have investigated full scale ageing in membrane systems keucken et al observed polyetherssulfone pes membrane over a 1 year period in an operational water treatment plant unfortunately the time period considered was too short to observe changes in membrane performance keucken et al 2016 he et al observed decreasing permeability over a 3 year period for polyvinylidene difluoride based pvdf based membranes operated in a drinking water application he et al 2014 fenu et al reported permeability decline in pvdf based membranes over a 10 year period in an mbr fenu et al 2012 most studies to date have focused on pvdf based membranes as pvdf is currently the dominant membrane chemistry utilized in drinking water treatment applications pearce 2017 although these studies provide insight into full scale ageing they a measured only limited performance factors b included only a short timeframe during which other parameters were measured and c only considered one full scale membrane treatment system to build on this existing work the field of membrane field ageing would benefit from performance factor data beyond permeability for multi year timescales analysis of membrane characteristics to explain performance changes and data from a variety of water treatment facilities to control for plant specific variation in water quality operation etc 1 4 objectives the primary objective of the present work was to determine which performance factors change over many years of full scale ageing this was achieved via collaboration with 8 canadian membrane facilities we hypothesized that performance outcomes similar to those observed in accelerated bench scale cycled ageing would be reflected in field aged membranes an increase in fouling rate and clean membrane resistance and a decrease in cleaning rate and a deterioration of membrane mechanical properties we also hypothesized that changes in the chemical characteristics of full scale aged membranes would provide a basis for explaining the observed changes in performance for example the amount of hydrophilic additives present in a membrane matrix have been observed to decline in bench scale aged membranes resulting in greater fouling abdullah and bérubé 2013 we anticipate that the same causal relationships would hold for field aged membranes from the observations of full scale aged membranes a further objective of the present work was to establish a practical means of benchmarking operational performance of membranes for use in membrane facilities a related objective was to assess the applicability of the c t dose commonly used at bench scale to quantify membrane ageing to ageing in full scale facilities 2 methods materials 2 1 full scale membrane harvesting membranes were harvested from 14 different trains at 8 partner membrane facilities i e water treatment facilities these facilities were selected because they all utilize similar membranes pvdf based zw1000 from suez water technologies solutions oakville canada the operational age of the membranes in the different trains at the facilities ranged in age from 0 years to 8 3 years a train refers to a group of membranes that operate simultaneously so they experience the same conditions over time operational age was used as the principal metric by which performance factors and chemical characteristics for the different trains were compared information on cumulative exposure dose i e c t to naocl was available for 5 of the facilities the relationship between operational age and cumulative expose dose for these facilities is discussed in section 3 4 at some facilities multiple trains of different ages were harvested the partner facilities from which fibres were harvested for the present study were as listed in table 1 among the 14 membrane trains two types of pvdf based membranes were identified based on physical and chemical characterization the specifications of the two membrane types are provided in table 2 though both are made primarily from pvdf they contain slightly different hydrophilic additives has the two types of pvdf membranes were therefore considered independently in the analysis because the has are proprietary the two types of membranes are simply identified here as 1000a newer current market product and 1000b older previous market product the target membrane harvesting frequency was twice per year though the actual harvesting frequency varied at some partner facilities due to operational constraints membrane fibres were harvested immediately after extensive recovery cleaning so that only irreversible foulants were considered to be present the harvested membrane fibres were shipped to the university of british columbia ubc where they were stored in distilled water with approximately 2 ppm naocl at 4 c until analysis 2 2 measurement of performance factors for full scale aged membranes 2 2 1 test module specifications for each full scale membrane harvesting event duplicate test modules were made using the harvested fibres in order to carry out bench scale performance testing either 5 for 1000a membranes or 7 for 1000b membranes membrane fibres were used for each module the top ends of the fibres were potted into rigid ¼ tubing using epoxy ensuring that individual fibres were not blocked the bottom ends of the fibres were sealed and potted with epoxy the modules were pressure tested at 55 kpa 8 psi to ensure the integrity of the seal before and after performance testing compromised modules were repaired with epoxy whenever possible or discarded test module preparation and membrane specifications are given in table 2 2 2 2 experimental setup three bench scale experimental setups fig 1 were built to assess the performance factors for full scale aged test modules each experimental setup included 4 membrane modules allowing for a total of 12 tests modules to be operated simultaneously the feed tanks 30 l and backwash tanks 30 l were located above the filtration tanks enabling gravity driven flow through timer controlled solenoid valves mcmaster carr 5489t491 the membrane tanks each 400 ml drained via gravity through timer controlled solenoid valves the peristaltic permeation and backwash pumps masterflex were also timer controlled pressure was monitored for all membrane modules using pressure transducers range 15 psig and recorded using labview signalexpress software the permeate flow was measured gravimetrically and was constant for the pressures encountered 2 2 3 performance assessment of full scale aged membranes prior to assessments membrane test modules were again cleaned by permeating with distilled water and then soaking overnight in an naocl solution ph 10 500 ppm after soaking the clean membrane resistance was determined by filtering distilled water square in fig 2 for 30 min and measuring the temperature flow rate and trans membrane pressure performance testing of the membrane test modules began with clean water resistance measurement as discussed above and then repeatedly cycled through a series of 30 min filtration circles in fig 2 and 30 min chemical enhanced backwash ceb cycles triangles in fig 2 both at 50 l m2h a model foulant solution was used for filtration and a naocl solution was used for the ceb the model foulant contained humic acid sigma aldrich sodium alginate sigma aldrich and bovine serum albumin sigma aldrich in a 2 1 1 mass ratio this composition was selected to represent a broad spectrum of natural organic matter nom foulants hajibabania et al 2012 these constituents were dissolved in tap water with characteristics as follows ph 7 0 7 4 hardness 6 2 9 9 mg l as caco3 alkalinity 4 6 8 9 mg l as caco3 and toc 0 5 1 0 mg l gvwd 2016 the total organic carbon toc of the model foulant solution was 10 mg l for performance testing of 1000a test modules and 5 mg l for 1000b test modules the different toc concentrations were selected to achieve relatively similar fouling rates for the 1000a and 1000b test modules estimated based on preliminary testing the fouling rates were quantified based on the slope of the change in trans membrane pressure tmp during the 2nd 3rd and 4th fouling cycles the fouling rate during the 1st cycles were consistently greater than those observed in the other cycles all of which had similar fouling rates for this reason steady operational conditions were assumed to exist for cycles 2 through 4 fig 2 the chemical enhanced backwash ceb solution contained 500 ppm naocl adjusted to ph 10 using hcl this ceb solution is typical of that used in periodic recovery cleans at the partner facilities from which fibres were harvested for our study after 4 repeated filtration and ceb cycles membranes test modules were again soaked overnight in 500 ppm naocl after which the clean membrane resistance was again determined as previously described following performance testing the membrane test modules were stored as previously described until further analysis prior to characterisation section 2 3 the membrane test modules were again rinsed with 500 ppm naocl followed by distilled water 2 3 chemical physical characterisation of full scale aged membranes membrane coupons 8 cm from each hollow fibre were harvested from the test modules and dried overnight at 50 c prior to chemical and physical characterisation the analyses performed are briefly presented below with specific operational details presented elsewhere robinson 2018 attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared atr ftir spectra were collected using a thermo nicolet nexus 670 ft ir raman spectrometer with a diamond window and resolution of 2 cm 1 blank and baseline correction were performed within omnic software across the range of interest 700 to 2000 cm 1 this window includes characteristic peaks for pvdf 1402 cm 1 and ha 1728 cm 1 for 1000a 1748 cm 1 for 1000b as well as the fingerprint region peak integration ranges were determined based on peak shape from composite spectra compiled from all membranes for all membrane samples duplicate ftir spectra were collected for each replicate sample i e 8 per sampling condition and the ha pvdf peak area ratios were calculated the peak ratios do not give a quantitative ha content however when normalized against the pvdf peak which is known to be stable for the conditions investigated the relative ha content can be assessed abdullah and bérubé 2013 example ftir spectra for 1000a and 1000b membranes are presented in the supplementary material proton spectra were collected using a 400 mhz bruker nuclear magnetic resonance nmr spectrometer with 128 scans dried membrane coupons 0 4 g were dissolved in dmso d 6 0 7 ml aided by sonication and mild heating 50 c for 15 min the triplet peak at 2 9 ppm was integrated as a relative reference for pvdf content the minor peak at 2 25 ppm corresponds to irregularly polymerized pvdf and was ignored the peak ratio is not an exact representation of the polymer ratio because the proton fraction in ha versus pvdf differs for this reason the peak ratio was compared to virgin or newest membranes in the analysis example nmr spectra for 1000a and 1000b membranes are presented in the supplementary material tensile testing was considered as a surrogate for susceptibility to breach tensile testing was performed using a modified version of the astm standard test method for tensile properties of single textile fibers d3822 astm 2014 briefly a 3 5 cm membrane coupon was held with 2 5 cm exposed between grips on kes g1 multi purpose tensile tester equipped with a 5 kg load cell depending on breakpoint elongation fibres were stretched at a rate of 0 2 mm s elongation of 100 most 1000bs or 1 mm s elongation of 100 most 1000as as per astm d3822 eight replicates were performed per harvesting event 4 from each test module the maximum stress and young s modulus were plotted as relevant to an individual fibre rather than per cross sectional area example stress strain curves are presented in the supplementary material 2 4 data analysis linear regression was used to determine the relationship between performance factors or characteristics and membrane operational age expressed in years all 1000a membranes had been operational for less than 5 years or half of their recommended life so were analyzed together the 1000b membranes ranged from 3 to 8 3 years and were analyzed as newer 1000b membranes 5 years of operation and older 1000b membranes 5 years of operation the p values presented in this manuscript relate to the null hypothesis that the slope of each trend equals zero for a linear relationship between a measured variable and the membrane age where p values suggested a linear relationship between variables the slope and 95 confidence interval of the trend line are presented a similar statistical approach was performed to link the surface ha content to the fouling rate testing for a non zero slope detailed statistical analysis for the different conditions considered is presented in the supplementary material both the extent of cleaning during a given period and the cleaning rate correlated closely with the fouling rate for 1000a and 1000b membranes see supplementary material this was expected because cleaning is greatly impacted by the amount of foulant present on the membrane prior to cleaning because the extent and rate of cleaning do not provide additional insight into our understanding of membrane ageing it is not discussed further details of the analysis relating to the extent and rate of cleaning are provided in the supplementary material 3 results discussion 3 1 effect of ageing on performance factors four performance factors as previously described were assessed for fibres harvested from full scale membrane facilities clean membrane resistance fouling rate cleaning rate susceptibility to breach robinson et al 2016 clean membrane resistance and fouling rate were assessed via clean water resistance tests and permeation tests respectively susceptibility to breach was assessed indirectly via tensile testing clean membrane resistance fouling rate and tensile testing observations are presented in figs 3 5 respectively data relating to each performance factor have been segregated into 1000a membranes left side of each figure and 1000b membranes right side of each figure all three membrane performance factors the clean membrane resistance fig 3a fouling rate fig 4a and all three indicators of susceptibility to breach percent elongation at break maximum stress and young s modulus fig 5a c and 5e respectively were observed to be remain unchanged for 1000a membranes with less than 5 years of operation unfortunately no data is available for 1000a membranes with more than approximately 5 years of operation further research is required to assess the impact of age on performance factors for this newer market product and to compare to the results for the 1000b membranes below note that the magnitudes of performance factors should not be compared directly for the two membrane types as they are different products with slightly different chemical and physical characteristics see table 2 all three membrane performance factors the clean membrane resistance fig 3b fouling rate fig 4b and all three indicators of susceptibility to breach percent elongation at break maximum stress and young s modulus fig 5b d and 5f respectively were also observed to be remain unchanged for 1000b membranes with less than 5 years of operation however all three membrane performance factors were observed to change significantly for 1000b membranes with more than 5 years of operation as illustrated in fig 3b the clean membrane resistance was higher and more variable for older 1000b membranes than for newer 1000b membranes the magnitude of the clean membrane resistance increased with membrane age beyond 5 years the fouling rate was also higher for the older 1000b membranes and increased in magnitude with membrane age beyond 5 years as illustrated in fig 4b for 1000b membranes greater than 5 years of age the percent elongation at break increased while the maximum stress and young s modulus decreased with membrane age fig 5b 5d and 5f respectively most bench scale single soak accelerated ageing studies of pvdf membranes have reported a decrease in membrane resistance with age abdullah and bérubé 2013 hajibabania et al 2012 le clech 2014 these studies attributed the reduction in resistance to an increase in membrane pore size caused by ageing the general explanation is that prolonged exposure to naocl cleaning agent causes removal of additives e g ha resulting in an opening of the membrane pore structure abdullah and bérubé 2013 arkhangelsky et al 2007 hajibabania et al 2012 jung et al 2004 pellegrin et al 2015 however in bench scale studies where cycled accelerated ageing was applied i e repeated fouling and cleaning an increase in resistance with age has been reported hajibabania et al 2012 he et al 2014 wang et al 2010 the increase in resistance observed in the present study was attributed to an accumulation of irreversible foulants on the membrane the increase in the magnitude and variability of the clean water resistance observed in the present study after 5 years of operation for the 1000b membranes at full scale is consistent with the results reported by others for cycled ageing studies suggesting that the resistance increase at full scale is due to irreversible fouling similar fouling rate results have been reported by others for both single soak ageing and cycled ageing studies these studies have reported an increase in fouling rate with age abdullah and bérubé 2013 gaudichet maurin and thominette 2006 qin et al 2004 2003 this increase in fouling rate is usually attributed to an decrease in membrane surface hydrophilicity with age as ha s are removed the impact of age on ha content is further discussed in section 3 2 abdullah and bérubé 2013 arkhangelsky et al 2008 gaudichet maurin and thominette 2006 levitsky et al 2012 2011 qin et al 2004 2003 the increase in fouling rate observed in the present study after 5 years of for the 1000b membranes at full scale is consistent with the increase in fouling rate reported by others for single soak and cycled ageing studies though magnitudes cannot be compared due to variation in foulant type and testing protocol the tensile testing results from the present study indicate that aged 1000b membranes are more ductile similar results have been reported previously wang et al 2010 though others have reported decreasing elongation with age hajibabania et al 2012 le clech 2014 the observed maximum stress at break indicates that aged 1000b membranes are weaker similar results have been reported for bench scale aged membranes in two prior studies hajibabania et al 2012 wang et al 2010 the elasticity results indicate that aged 1000b membranes are more readily deformed with age a decreasing young s modulus has also been observed by others for bench scale aged membranes wang et al 2010 mechanical deterioration has been attributed to change in crystallinity of the pvdf as additives are removed around the pvdf molecules hashim et al 2011 however the mechanism behind the deterioration of mechanical properties is not well understood and was beyond the scope of the present research nonetheless the observed changes in mechanical properties suggest that aged membranes may be more susceptible to breach than newer membranes 3 2 effect of ageing on membrane characteristics similar trends to those observed for the performance factors were also observed for the membrane chemical characteristics two analytical techniques atr ftir spectroscopy and nmr spectroscopy were used to quantify the amount of hydrophilic additive ha present on the membrane surfaces and in the membrane bulk respectively atr ftir and nmr observations are presented in figs 6 and 7 data relating to each characteristic have been segregated into 1000a membranes left side of each figure and 1000b membranes right side of each figure the membrane surface ha content assessed via atr ftir decreased slightly fig 6a and the bulk ha content assessed via nmr was observed to be remain unchanged fig 7a for 1000a membranes ranging from 0 to 5 years of operation though decrease in ha surface content was statistically significant it amounted to less than 10 surface ha being removed over 5 years so was a small effect as previously discussed no data is available for 1000a membranes with more than approximately 5 years of operation to gain insight into the stability of ha for 1000a membranes beyond a 5 year period an ad hoc single soak bench scale accelerated ageing test was performed new1000a membranes were soaked in a 5000 ppm solution of naocl at ph 10 for 16 days equivalent to a dose of 2 000 000 ppm h based on this test 35 of the ha content was removed from 1000a membrane surface atr ftir analysis and 22 from the bulk nmr analysis these results indicate that the ha content of full scale 1000a membranes is expected to decrease in a manner similar to that observed for the 1000b membranes this suggests that the performance factors are also expected to change in a manner similar to those observed for the 1000b membranes beyond a 5 year period continued characterization of the performance factors and chemical characteristics of membranes aged at full scale is recommended for both the 1000a and 1000b membranes both chemical characteristics the surface ha content fig 6b and the bulk ha content fig 7b were constant with respect to membrane age for 1000b membranes with less than 5 years of operation however both chemical characteristics were observed to change significantly for 1000b membranes with more than 5 years of operation for 1000b membranes greater than 5 years of age the surface ha content was lower than for those less than 5 years of age the magnitude of the surface ha content decreased with membrane age p 0 007 as illustrated in 6b for 1000b membranes greater than 5 years of age the bulk ha content was lower than for those less than 5 years of age the magnitude of the bulk ha content decreased with membrane age p 0 018 as illustrated in fig 7b statistical analyses are presented in the supplementary material to better understand membrane degradation bulk and surface ha pvdf ratios were compared as presented in fig 8 ha content was compared to assess whether removal is preferentially from the membrane surface of the bulk the bulk and surface ha content was generally lower for aged 1000b membranes figs 6b and 7b respectively as illustrated in fig 8b the results indicate that although the removal of ha occurred throughout the membrane matrix surface ha may have been initially preferrentially removed but that bulk ha was removed to a greater extent as membranes aged this trend is illustrated with a curved arrow fig 8b though it was beyond the scope of the present work to establish a model for this phenomenon although the mechanism of ha removal was not investigated in the present work others have observed that ha in membranes with 1000b type chemistry is oxidized by naocl abdullah and bérubé 2013 the oxidation products are soluble and are therefore released from the membrane matrix for 1000a membranes bulk and surface ha content remained relatively constant figs 6a and 7a respectively and as ilustrated in fig 8a the bulk and surface ha content are clustered together regardless of membrane age however as previously discussed the ha content of the 1000a membranes is expected to change in a manner similar to that observed for the 1000b membranes as the number of years of operation increases 3 3 linking performance factors to characteristics potential links between changes in performance factors and membrane characteristics were assessed to better understand the ageing phenomena because there was no significant change in the performance factors or chemical characteristics of 1000a membranes for the range of membrane ages available i e less than 5 years old the following analysis is based only on data for the 1000b membranes of all ages many studies have suggested that the ha content of pvdf membranes directly impacts the membrane fouling rate robinson et al 2016 the fouling rate with respect to the surface ha content is presented in fig 9 the fouling rate was significantly higher for 1000b membranes with lower ha content on the membrane surface these results support the concept that as the surface ha content decreases more hydrophobic membranes have a higher affinity for organic foulants 3 4 identifying benchmarks for operational water treatment plants to adapt the findings of the present study for use by operational facilities we sought to identify a convenient metric of membrane ageing for full scale facilities changes were observed in all metrics performance factors and chemical characteristics after about 5 years for 1000b membranes continuous monitoring of all performance factors and characteristics to monitor ageing would not be feasible at full scale facilities the time personnel analysis and harvesting requirements would be onerous however continuous monitoring of resistance and in particular resistance following extensive chemical cleaning is performed at full scale resistance following extensive chemical cleaning is analogous to the clean water resistance performance factor presented here as presented in the supplementary material the clean membrane resistance correlated well with all other metrics as membranes age therefore high resistance following extensive cleaning could be used as an indicator of membrane ageing at full scale facilities the observed change in the various metrics considered with respect to age and with respect to observed clean membrane resistance are summarized in table 3 based on these observations membrane facilities with sustained and irreversible increases in resistance following extensive cleaning should be vigilant of membrane ageing note that all resistance values should be normalized to a standard temperature e g 20 c to account for seasonal changes in temperature 3 5 relationship between age and exposure dose the estimates of the exposure dose c t to naocl compared with operational ages for the 5 facilities for which such data was available are presented in fig 10 note that most of the partner facilities assume that the concentration of naocl in the cleaning solution remains constant during storage and use it should be noted that the naocl concentration is expected to decrease as it reacts with foulants and other material in the membrane tank a strong correlation r2 0 95 was observed between membrane age and reported naocl exposure dose for most facilities however for one facility the cumulative naocl exposure dose was much higher than the others for a given operational age data from this facility are identified by the symbol x in fig 10 as well as in figs 3 7 further investigation revealed that this facility had implemented an atypical i e frequent and aggressive chemical cleaning protocol in an attempt to address operational problems considering the linear relationship between the cumulative exposure dose and operational age it may be possible to estimate an effective age for this atypical facility by identifying the operational age for which the estimated exposure dose intersects this linear relationship fig 10 for the atypical facility the effective age was estimated to be approximately 13 years unfortunately the membranes at the atypical facility were replaced soon after our study commenced so further temporal data were unavailable for this particular train recalling sections 3 1 and 3 2 the clean membrane resistance for membranes from the atypical facility was more than double that from all other facilities fig 3b and fouling rates from this facility were among the greatest observed fig 4b the mechanical properties of membranes from this facility were also poorer than the other facilities in the study fig 5b d f and had the lowest observed ha content both surface and bulk of all figs 6b and 7b respectively the ageing trends in fig 3 through fig 7 included the membranes from the atypical plant at their operational age approximately 8 years however when the performance factors and characteristics for membranes from this atypical facility are plotted with respect to effective age rather than actual age all correlations considered improve significantly as presented in the supplementary material these results indicate that if extensive and frequent chemical cleaning is required for operation beyond what is typical membrane ageing is expected to accelerate thus changes in performance and membrane characteristics are expected to occur earlier and to a greater magnitude in such cases operational protocols should be reviewed to reduce the extent and frequency of chemical cleaning for example by improving or implementing pre treatment 4 conclusions the present research investigated changes in performance factors as well as chemical characteristics of full scale aged ultrafiltration membranes our work illuminates the knowledge gap between results from previous bench scale ageing studies and performance factors and chemical characteristics relevant to operational membrane facilities for 1000a membranes no significant changes in performance or chemical characteristics were observed over the course of the study older 1000a membranes would be necessary to determine whether this stable operation persists but such full scale aged membranes are not yet available results from a single soaked accelerated ageing test of 1000a membranes indicated that ha content of full scale aged 1000a membranes is expected to decrease with sufficient naocl exposure thus we anticipate that performance may also change after long term full scale ageing as observed for the 1000b membranes we observed that the clean membrane resistance of 1000b membranes increased after approximately 5 years of operation increasing resistance is consistent with some bench scale aged membranes that have been cycled with foulant and cleaning agent however our results contradict bench scale ageing using a prolonged single soak in naocl the discrepancy likely stems from the opposing effects of pore enlargement and irreversible fouling on the clean membrane resistance the membrane fouling rate also increased for older membranes consistent with the literature on bench scale ageing though the susceptibility to breach cannot be measured directly three metrics elongation at break maximum stress and young s modulus were all observed to deteriorate with membrane age also in agreement with bench scale ageing both bulk and surface chemistry of the 1000b membranes changed with age after 5 years of operation the hydrophilic additive was observed to decrease in the bulk and on the membrane surface the reduction in ha content likely increases the fouling rate for older membranes as foulants tend to sorb to more hydrophobic surfaces we observed that the clean membrane resistance correlated well with all other performance factors and chemical characteristics studied if a sustained irreversible increase in clean membrane resistance is observed over time plant operators should be cognisant that fouling and achieving sufficient flux may become difficult and that membrane breaches may occur more frequently this finding is useful to water treatment plant operators or managers seeking a metric to assess their infrastructure and for membrane manufacturers in better understanding their products finally although c t was not used as a metric of membrane age we observed that for one plant that applied an atypically high dose of naocl the effective age of the membranes appeared to be greater than their operational age thus as indicated by the results of bench scale studies avoiding excessive cumulative naocl exposure is advised furthermore naocl c t would likely provide a suitable ageing metric for full scale ageing if dose fluctuates over years of operation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or
