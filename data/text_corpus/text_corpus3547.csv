17735,algal cells and algal organic matter aom are a source of high dissolved organic carbon doc and nitrogen don concentrations this poses a possible health risk due to their potential to form disinfection by products dbps some of which may be of health concern after disinfection while several studies have focussed on the formation of carbonaceous dbps from aom only a few studies have focussed on the formation of nitrogen containing n dbps from aom hence the main aim of this study was to thoroughly investigate the n dbp formation potential of the aom from a species of cyanobacteria commonly found in natural waters microcystis aeruginosa three haloacetonitriles two halonitromethanes two haloacetamides and eight n nitrosamines were analysed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry after chlorination and chloramination of the extracted aom to provide further insight into the influence of changing don character on n dbp formation potential the aom from three other species chlorella vulgaris dolichospermum circinale and cylindrospermopsis raciborskii were also tested dichloroacetonitrile dcan was the dbp formed in the highest concentrations for both chlorination and chloramination of bulk aom from all the species furthermore during chlorination and chloramination the high molecular weight fraction 1 kda of aom from m aeruginosa had a greater dcan formation potential normalised to doc or don than the aom in the low molecular weight fraction 1 kda of m aeruginosa regardless of growth stage n nitrosamine formation from the bulk aom of all species occurred only after chloramination the molar concentration of n nitrosodimethylamine ndma was lower than the other n nitrosamines detected however ndma formation increased with culture age for all four species in contrast to most other n nitrosamines whose formation remained consistent or decreased with culture age overall algal growth could result in elevated concentrations of n dbps due to the increasing concentrations of high molecular weight algal don in the aom it is suggested that the aom comprises precursors containing long c chain amine r1 nh r2 or cyclic n containing amine structures comparisons to previously measured n dbp concentrations in drinking water suggest that the aom from the algae and cyanobacteria examined in this study are not likely to be a major source of precursors for either dcan or ndma in real waters however aom may present a major precursor source for other n nitrosamines graphical abstract image 1 keywords algal organic matter dbp formation ndma dcan 1 introduction the presence of algae and cyanobacteria in raw waters can present a significant challenge for water treatment operators if downstream treatment processes are ineffective residual cells and algal derived organic matter aom can react with chemical disinfectants forming disinfection by products dbps and these are often carbon based c dbps and nitrogen based n dbps pivokonsky et al 2016 previous investigations of dbp formation from disinfection of algae laden waters have largely focussed on the formation of c dbps such as trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas chen et al 2017 dong et al 2019b gu et al 2020 hua et al 2018 liu et al 2018 pivokonsky et al 2016 zhao et al 2020 zhou et al 2015 for example variations in c dbp formation from algal sources has been studied extensively by conducting disinfection experiments on cells zhao et al 2020 intra and extra cellular organic matter dong et al 2019b zhao et al 2020 and algae of different growth stages chen et al 2017 hua et al 2018 as well as using varying disinfectant concentrations gu et al 2020 and different disinfectants gu et al 2020 liu et al 2018 2019 recently n dbps have been considered to be a greater human health risk than the c dbps prompting further investigation of n dbps as a priority dong et al 2019a goslan et al 2017 liu et al 2018 richardson et al 2007 a number of studies have investigated the formation of n dbps from precursors that originate from microalgal cells qi et al 2016 xu et al 2017 and bulk unfractionated aom dong et al 2019a fang et al 2010b goslan et al 2017 hua et al 2019 qi et al 2016 xu et al 2017 while understanding n dbp formation from cells is important a greater focus has been placed on n dbp formation from the aom because water treatment processes are typically designed to minimise cell lysis to prevent the release of toxins and organic compounds from inside the cells into the water li et al 2012 lui et al 2012 pivokonsky et al 2016 sun et al 2018 zhou et al 2015 furthermore there is high cell removal but poor to moderate aom removal in water treatment processes which results in the presence of aom in the treated water during the disinfection stage henderson et al 2010 in light of this goslan et al 2017 compared the aom from a few algae such as scenedesmus subspicatus anabaena flos aquae microcystis aeruginosa for dcan formation after disinfection with chlorine and reported that the bulk aom of m aeruginosa formed the highest concentration of dcan in other studies formation of some haloacetonitriles hans haloacetamides haams and or n nitrosodimethylamine ndma were evaluated from chlorination and or chloramination of bulk or fractionated aom extracted from a few algal species lui et al 2012 sun et al 2018 zhou et al 2015 however it is known that aom character can vary widely between species and therefore it is anticipated that n dbp formation potential may also vary there is limited to no information available on the formation of a wide spectrum of n dbps such as halonitromethanes hnms haams and n nitrosamines other than ndma from both chlorination and chloramination of bulk and fractionated aom with very differing character as these n dbps have been observed to form from the organic matter present in natural waters and result in cyto and geno toxicity alexandrou et al 2018 bond et al 2012 ding et al 2019 fang et al 2018 further research on their formation from differing aom is needed overall there is still a lack of understanding on how aom including the fractions within that aom from a range of species with differing character contributes to the formation of n dbps beyond ndma and a few hans or haams studies investigating n dbp formation during chloramination can have additional challenges as n transfer to the dbp may occur from organic n compounds or the chloramine disinfectant yang et al 2010 this has been resolved by using 15n labelled monochloramine which has helped delineate n transfer from monochloramine to the dbp via a specific mechanism aldehyde pathway in studies that used unlabelled aom le roux et al 2016 drinking water chuang et al 2013 chuang and tung 2015 and wastewater huang et al 2012 however the application of the 15n labelled monochloramine has its limitations as it only evaluates dbp formation via one specific mechanism aldehyde pathway in relation to other dbp formation mechanisms that are equally probable for eg decarboxylation pathway linge et al 2020 vu et al 2018 yang et al 2010 as the n dbp formation from aom can occur via different mechanisms goslan et al 2017 krasner et al 2007 qi et al 2016 using 15n labelled don would be novel and beneficial in tracking the source of n in the n dbps the aims of this study were therefore threefold a to examine in detail for the first time the bulk and fractionated aom of the commonly found cyanobacteria in natural waters m aeruginosa for n dbp formation potential under both chlorination and chloramination conditions including analysis of three hans two hnms two haams and eight n nitrosamines bulk aom only b to illustrate the impact of variations in don character on n dbp formation potential during chlorination and chloramination by examining n dbp formation from the bulk aom of three more species dolichospermum circinale cylindrospermopsis raciborskii and chlorella vulgaris and c to identify whether n was sourced from organic n or monochloramine during n dbp formation via the novel approach of chloramination of 15n labelled aom 2 materials and methods 2 1 cultivation of algae and preparation of aom three cyanobacteria m aeruginosa cs 555 01 d circinale formerly a circinalis cs 533 02 and c raciborskii cs 508 and one green algae c vulgaris cs 42 7 were obtained from the australian national algae culture collection csiro hobart tasmania and sub cultured in 250 ml flasks containing 100 ml each of sterilised mla for cyanobacteria and jaworski for green algae media respectively li et al 2019 additionally to determine n dbp formation pathways during chloramination 15n labelled species were grown in media containing 15n labelled sodium nitrate sigma aldrich 98 for two culture cycles to ensure that 14n labelled sodium nitrate from previous culturing cycles was completely replaced the 15n contents were 82 4 and 98 7 of tn for 15n labelled jaworski and mla media respectively si table s2 1 for the extraction of dissolved aom two time points in the exponential growth phase and the stationary growth phase were selected which corresponded to day 11 12 and day 20 21 respectively si figure s2 1 for all species except c raciborskii cs 508 which had a lower rate of nitrate depletion and aom production for this species the aom was extracted in the stationary and late stationary growth phases instead corresponding to days 20 21 and days 30 31 respectively in all cases the aom was extracted by subjecting the cultures to a two step filtration process using first a 1 2 μm filter and then a 0 45 μm filter the bulk aom 0 45 μm was further separated into different size fractions using ultrafiltration and the sizes of these fractions were verified and further characterised using liquid chromatography with organic carbon and nitrogen detection lc ocnd model 8 doc labor germany as discussed further in si s2 2 2 the cut off sizes of the membranes were 50 kda and 1 kda resulting in the following aom fractions a 0 45 μm bulk aom control sample b 0 45 μm 50 kda high molecular weight hmw biopolymers c 50 1 kda hmw building blocks and d 1 kda low molecular weight lmw the terms building blocks and biopolymers have been operationally defined by huber et al 2011 all the aom fractions were adjusted to 2 mg c l 1 as doc before undertaking characterisation or n dbp formation potential experiments except when the aom fractions contained 2 mg c l 1 doc as was the case for c raciborskii where the experiments were undertaken using solutions of 1 mg c l 1 2 2 organic carbon and nitrogen characterisation total don concentrations in the bulk and size fractionated aom samples were determined by first analysing the total dissolved nitrogen tn concentration using a shimadzu toc vcsh tnm 1 analyser japan and then measuring the dissolved inorganic nitrogen din concentration using the lc ocnd system the don concentration was then determined by subtracting the din concentration from the tn concentration a method validated by li et al 2019 and referred to henceforth as the tn din method the doc concentrations were measured using the shimadzu toc vcsh tnm 1 analyser japan 2 3 aom disinfection experiments chlorination experiments on the bulk and size fractionated aom were undertaken using free chlorine chloramination experiments were undertaken using 15n labelled aom bulk and fractionated and pre formed monochloramine in order to evaluate the maximum potential for n dbp formation from the aom chlorine was added in excess and longer reaction times than that used in water treatment plants were applied carranzo 2012 sun et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 zhou et al 2015 all disinfection experiments were conducted at ph 7 and maintained at 21 c in the dark for 72 h all experiments were conducted in triplicate si section s2 3 provides full details on the aom disinfection experiments 2 4 analysis of n dbps as m aeruginosa is one of the most common species found in natural waters bowling et al 2016 paerl and otten 2013 its aom was subject to the most intense examination including the n dbp formation potential for three hans two hnms two haams and eight n nitrosamines by gc ms tables 1 and si tables s2 2 and s2 3 to provide further insight into the influence of changing don character the aom from the other species were tested for n dbp formation potential as identified in table 1 hnms and haams were measured based on the procedure of liew et al 2012 hans were analysed based on the procedure outlined by kristiana et al 2012 and n nitrosamines were analysed following mcdonald et al 2012 in all cases surrogate standards deuterated n dbps were added to each sample prior to sample extraction while internal standards were added after sample preparation to monitor instrument performance si section s2 4 1 provides complete details on n dbp analytical protocols 3 results and discussion 3 1 n dbp formation following chlorination of aom after 72 h of chlorination dcan and tcan were the only n dbps detected in either bulk or fractionated aom from the four species m aeruginosa cs 555 01 d circinale cs 533 02 c raciborskii cs 508 and c vulgaris cs 42 7 3 1 1 dichloroacetonitrile dcan formation from bulk aom the normalised dcan concentration from the bulk aom ranged from 0 24 0 02 to 1 06 0 03 μg mg 1c and 1 95 0 13 to 16 7 0 43 μg mg 1n depending on the species and growth phase fig 1 these dcan formation potentials are consistent with previous reports of chlorination of aom producing 0 3 1 4 μg mg 1c for m aeruginosa fang et al 2010b goslan et al 2017 liu et al 2018 ma et al 2017 yang et al 2011 and 0 4 2 2 μg mg 1c for c vulgaris huang et al 2013 yang et al 2011 the highest normalised dcan formation was from the green algae c vulgaris followed by d circinale m aeruginosa and c raciborskii fig 1 this was in contrast to the findings of goslan et al 2017 who reported that the british strain of m aeruginosa produced three six times more dcan upon chlorination when compared to the green algae tested suggesting that the total dcan formation could be dependent on the character of the bulk aom which in turn is species and strain dependent normalised dcan concentrations increased with culture age for all algal species studied similar to the results observed by yang et al 2011 who observed a ten fold increase in dcan concentrations by day 30 during the disinfection of aom from m aeruginosa and c vulgaris chinese strains this suggests that changes in don and doc character between the exponential and stationary phases or stationary and late stationary phases for c raciborski results in an increase in dcan formation this was particularly apparent for the aom of c raciborski and c vulgaris which had a 147 and 40 increase in don normalised dcan concentration fig 1 respectively indicating that the aom released in the late stationary phase was a more potent dcan precursor therefore water treatment plant operators have to take precautions to mitigate risks associated with dcan formation as greater aom concentrations have been observed following the stationary and late stationary phases during the death of algal blooms 3 1 2 dcan formation from size fractionated aom the normalised dcan concentrations from size fractionated aom are shown in fig 2 a and b it is evident that the trends observed in fig 2a and b were similar to those observed in fig 1 thereby giving confidence in the two sets of results one on bulk aom and the other on the same aom fractionated out of the total normalised dcan both doc and don normalised more than 50 was from the hmw 0 45 μm 50 kda biopolymer and 50 1 kda building blocks fractions for all species and growth phases except for c raciborskii in the stationary phase where these hmw fractions produced 48 dcan when normalised to don fig 2b moreover the contribution of hmw aom to the total dcan formation increased with culture age for all species except for d circinale which showed similar dcan normalised to doc and don formation in the hmw fraction irrespective of the age fig 2a and b these comparisons suggest hmw 1 kda rather than lmw 1 kda aom had a greater reactivity for dcan formation at all stages of growth dcan formation from the hmw fractions was also species and age dependent for instance the dcan formation normalised to don in the building blocks fractions of aom from c vulgaris and m aeruginosa was 20 and 28 respectively in the exponential growth phase and 39 in the building blocks fractions of aom from both organisms in the stationary growth phase fig 2b for six of the eight cases shown in fig 2b dcan formation in the building blocks fraction was comparable or greater than that in the biopolymer fraction when normalised to don this was more apparent when the cultures aged thereby suggesting that the don in the aged algal building blocks fraction was more active in forming dcan than that in the biopolymer fraction during chlorination at this juncture it is also important to note that while the bulk or fractionated aom of m aeruginosa in the stationary phase had a high propensity to produce dcan the dcan formation from m aeruginosa was considerably lower than other species such as c vulgaris or d circinale a number of dcan precursors such as heterocyclic n in nucleic acids proteinaceous materials and amino acids such as aspartic acid and tryptophan bound to humic structures have been identified previously bond et al 2009 2012 and in the aom they have largely been associated with the building blocks and biopolymers fractions li et al 2019 when chlorine is present in excess i e cl n 2 m m dcan formation from amino acids or peptides is proposed to occur by the decarboxylation pathway si figure s3 1 which involves chlorination of n terminal amino groups bond et al 2012 deborde and von gunten 2008 hureiki et al 1994 joo and mitch 2007 after dichlorination of the terminal amino acid a nitrile is formed from elimination of hydrochloric acid and subsequent decarboxylation bond et al 2012 the electron withdrawing nature of the nitrile can promote further dichlorination of the α c atom producing dichlorocyanoacetic acid which in turn liberates dcan upon decarboxylation mitch et al 2009 this pathway from n terminal amino groups has also been proposed previously for dcan formation from chlorinated aom fang et al 2010b goslan et al 2017 nihemaiti et al 2015 in the current study the cl n ratios m m in bulk and fractionated aom experiments varied from 5 6 to 40 during chlorination and also during chloramination see section 3 2 therefore amino acid like moieties from algal peptides or from degraded algal biopolymers or building blocks are likely to become dichlorinated and potentially undergo the decarboxylation pathway to form dcan nihemaiti et al 2015 3 1 3 formation of other hans no tcan was detected from the aom of m aeruginosa in any of the growth phases however tcan was detected from other organisms in either the stationary phase aom from c vulgaris and d circinale or the later stationary phase aom from c raciborskii which suggested that tcan formation could increase with algal age the tcan concentrations normalised to doc ranged from 0 02 to 0 06 μg mg 1c depending on the species and fractions sitable s3 1 which was much lower than dcan formation fig 1 however low tcan concentrations may have also been caused by the inherent instability of tcan at ph 5 5 where tcan can undergo base catalysed hydrolysis farre et al 2012 goslan et al 2017 kristiana et al 2014 or higher rates of hydrolysis when exposed to residual chlorine glezer et al 1999 oliver 1983 in this study chlorination experiments were buffered at ph 7 and the free chlorine residual after chlorination for 72 h was typically 4 6 mg l 1 3 1 4 other n dbp classes no formation of hnms haams or n nitrosamines was detected above the respective lods from the chlorinated bulk aom for any of the four species tested at either growth phase sitable s2 2 the absence of hnm formation in this study is in contrast to previous studies which have reported low tcnm concentrations 0 03 0 27 μg mg 1c after chlorination from both cell suspensions and aom of m aeruginosa fang et al 2010a goslan et al 2017 yang et al 2011 there is little published information regarding haam formation from chlorinated aom zhang et al 2017 it has been reported that 0 03 μg l 1 0 1 μg mg 1 c of dcaam formed from chlorinated algal eps of chlorella huang et al 2012 this value is below the lod of dcaam analysis in this study 0 1 μg l 1 previous studies on n nitrosamine formation from chlorinated m aeruginosa have reported values ranging from 7 to 13 ng mg 1c fang et al 2010b ma et al 2017 however these studies used cells and aom from a late exponential phase and the doc concentrations were 2 mg l 1 used in this study 3 2 n dbp formation after chloramination of 15n labelled aom after 72 h of chloramination one of the three hans dcan was detected from both bulk and size fractionated 15n labelled aom and seven of the eight n nitrosamines measured were detected from the bulk 15n labelled aom from all four species in all the growth phases the eighth n nitrosamine nmor was only detected from one replicate of three of bulk aom of c vulgaris and c raciborskii 3 2 1 dcan formation from bulk 15n labelled aom the total dcan concentration i e sum of 14n and 15n labelled dcan from bulk aom increased with culture age when normalised to doc or don fig 3 a and b unlike dcan formation post chlorination m aeruginosa produced the highest normalised dcan concentrations followed by c raciborskii c vulgaris and d circinale when compared at the same growth stage suggesting that the m aeruginosa aom had a higher reactivity for dcan formation than the other three species under chloramination conditions the normalised dcan concentrations of the bulk aom from m aeruginosa and c vulgaris in the stationary phase were 0 34 0 01 μg mg 1c and 0 16 0 02 μg mg 1c fig 3a respectively and were comparable or lower than previously reported values of 0 4 μg mg 1c for m aeruginosa late stationary phase day 42 fang et al 2010b and 0 18 μg mg 1c and 0 22 μg mg 1c for c vulgaris cells yang et al 2011 and extracellular organic matter huang et al 2013 respectively when considering 14n and 15n labelled dcan individually 14n labelled dcan made up between 73 and 98 of total dcan fig 3a indicating that most of the n in the dcan originated from the monochloramine disinfectant 14nh2cl rather than the 15n labelled aom this result is consistent with previous studies which reported the nh2cl contribution to the n in dcan to be 60 during chloramination on algal extracellular organic matter huang et al 2012 and 70 during chloramination of nom yang et al 2010 suggesting that the dcan formation mechanism during chloramination of aom is comparable to the formation mechanism from other nom precursors despite the generally higher formation of 14n labelled dcan the percentage of 15n labelled dcan did increase with culture age irrespective of doc or don normalisation and across all the species fig 3a and b this suggests that an increasing proportion of 15n labelled aom acts as a precursor for dcan as the culture ages either due to ongoing 15n assimilation from the media or internal conversion of 15n labelled aom to more reactive dcan precursors the maximum incorporation of 15n into total dcan during chloramination of bulk aom was from bulk d circinale 27 2 normalised to doc 29 2 normalised to don fig 3a and b while it is possible that 14n was incorporated into aom during cell culturing with the 15n labelled media it is still most likely that the majority of 14n incorporated into dcan up to 73 originated from unlabelled ammonium chloride nh2cl used to prepare the monochloramine and this agrees with a previous study of dcan formation from unlabelled organic matter and 15n labelled nh2cl huang et al 2012 which showed that more than 70 of n incorporated in dcan was from the monochloramine when reacted with either chlorella extracellular organic matter samples or standard nom reference materials yang et al 2010 also found that up to 92 of n incorporated in dcan originated from monochloramine during chloramination of suwannee river nom with dcan formation linearly increasing with monochloramine dose 3 2 2 dcan formation from size fractionated 15n labelled aom normalised dcan concentrations post chloramination of 15n labelled aom size fractions varied with species and also increased with culture age fig 4 a and b similar to dcan formation after chlorination more than 50 of total normalised dcan from bulk aom resulted from the hmw fractions except for c vulgaris and c raciborskii in the stationary phase where their hmw fractions produced 48 and 45 of the total dcan when normalised to doc fig 4a in addition the dcan concentrations from individual 15n labelled aom fractions in the latter growth stages were different when normalised by either doc or don for example when normalised to doc the lmw fraction was the highest contributor to total dcan formation for three species 52 for c vulgaris 44 for m aeruginosa and 43 for d circinale fig 4a the exception was c raciborskii which had higher contributions from the building blocks 35 and biopolymer 33 fractions this was mainly caused by the relative increase of the proportion of dcan formation from the biopolymer fraction 15 33 when the c raciborskii cultures aged fig 4a when normalised to don the hmw don produced proportionally more dcan than lmw don after chloramination of all species fig 4b for instance d circinale had 54 of total dcan formation from the building blocks fraction additionally the biopolymer fraction of c raciborskii showed the greatest increase in proportional dcan formation of 19 for an individual fraction as the culture aged fig 4b interestingly hmw don was also observed to produce proportionally more dcan during chlorination fig 2b thereby suggesting that dcan production via chlorination or chloramination was a function of the proportion of hmw don in the aom as observed for the unlabelled 14n and 15n labelled dcan formation from the bulk aom a greater proportion of unlabelled dcan 75 95 of total dcan was produced in the fractions upon chloramination compared to the 15n labelled dcan figure s3 2 this again indicates that n was mainly incorporated from the monochloramine disinfectant 14nh2cl rather than the 15n labelled aom precursors the percentage of 15n labelled dcan increased with algal age for all the fractions in addition the percentage of 15n labelled dcan was consistently higher for the lmw fraction than the biopolymers or building blocks fractions when normalised to doc or don for instance the don normalised proportions of 15n labelled dcan in total dcan in the lmw and building blocks fractions were 18 and 14 for c vulgaris 22 and 20 for m aeruginosa 26 and 14 for d circinale in the stationary phase and 10 and 8 for c raciborskii in the late stationary phase figure s3 2 a1 b1 c1 d1 these results suggest that lmw algal don may contain relatively more chloramine reactive 15n labelled dcan precursors than the other fractions this could be due to the breakdown of algal don from biopolymers and building blocks fractions to the lmw fractions fang et al 2010b pivokonsky et al 2016 resulting in several small molecules that were labelled with 15n 3 2 3 formation pathway of dcan from chloramination formation of dcan from chloramination has been suggested to occur either by the decarboxylation pathway where the n in dcan originates from the don precursor usually an amino acid sifigure s3 3 or the aldehyde pathway sifigure s3 3 where the n is incorporated from the monochloramine during reaction with an aldehyde bond et al 2014 shah and mitch 2012 the aldehyde precursor may be a functional group within aom or can be produced as an intermediate during reactions between organic compounds in the aom and the disinfectant yang et al 2010 given the relative proportions of unlabelled 14n and labelled 15n incorporated into dcan in this study it appears that the aldehyde pathway was the major formation pathway for dcan from amino acid functionalities within aom this pathway also provides a route for dcan formation from chloramination of non nitrogenous components through aldehyde groups in aom however the incorporation of some 15n into dcan does suggest that formation via the decarboxylation pathway occurs to a small extent 3 2 4 comparison of dcan formation from chlorination and chloramination for the bulk aom from all species the dcan concentration normalised to doc or don was between 1 3 and 12 times greater after chlorination than chloramination sifigure s3 4 this is consistent with many previous studies that have also found higher dcan formation post chlorination than chloramination of aom goslan et al 2017 huang et al 2012 zhu et al 2015 drinking water samples goslan et al 2009 kristiana et al 2012 and nom and n containing model compounds bond et al 2014 huang et al 2012 joo and mitch 2007 mitch and sedlak 2002b yang et al 2007 2010 with limited studies finding dcan formation higher after chloramination huang et al 2012 lee et al 2007 this suggests that the mechanism of dcan formation from aom may be comparable to other nom and model compound precursors with respect to the aom fractions there was a strong indication that more dcan was produced from hmw compounds than lmw compounds during both chlorination and chloramination because 29 out of 32 disinfection scenarios had a higher dcan formation from the hmw fraction 1 kda than the lmw fraction 1 kda figs 2 and 4 the three exceptions were dcan produced from lmw aom of c vulgaris fig 4a and c raciborskii figs 2b and 4a on day 20 and the dcan produced was only marginally greater 52 55 of total dcan than that produced from hmw aom these results are supported by previous research on a range of freshwater and marine algal and cyanobacterial species such as c vulgaris m aeruginosa alexandrium tamarense and chaetoceros affinis wherein higher dcan formation was reported in aom fractions with mw 1 kda when compared to fractions with mw 1 kda dong et al 2019a ma et al 2017 villacorte et al 2015 zhou et al 2015 overall these results reiterate that the character of aom influences its reactivity with the disinfectant 3 2 5 n nitrosodimethylamine ndma formation from bulk aom as n nitrosamines contain two n atoms their formation from 15n labelled aom and unlabelled monochloramine could potentially produce 14n 14n ndma 15n 15n labelled ndma or 14n 15n labelled ndma however previous studies of ndma formation have found that the nitroso group n typically comes from the monochloramine while the amino group n is from the organic matter source choi and valentine 2002 mitch and sedlak 2002a resulting in preferential formation of 14n 15n labelled ndma in this study 14n 14n ndma and 14n 15n labelled ndma were both detected but 15n 15n labelled ndma was not detected despite the expectation that 14n 15n labelled ndma would form preferentially most samples formed more 14n 14n ndma and the maximum 14n 15n labelled ndma formation 59 3 normalised to doc was during chloramination of aom from the late stationary phase for c raciborskii fig 5 this suggests that 14n was still incorporated into the aom even though the 15n proportion of total n in the mla and jaworski media were 98 7 and 82 4 respectively sitable s2 1 this could imply that the algae were still utilising external 14n sources possibly atmospheric n2 total ndma i e sum of 14n 14n ndma and 14n 15n labelled ndma was species dependent but increased with growth stage for all algal species irrespective of whether the ndma concentrations were normalised to doc or don fig 5a and b the lowest total ndma concentrations were from c vulgaris 0 83 1 3 ng mg 1c no 14n 15n labelled ndma detected and from the commonly found m aeruginosa 1 1 1 8 ng mg 1c 30 40 14n 15n labelled ndma detected fig 5a the highest total ndma concentration was 11 24 0 55 ng mg 1c and was observed from c raciborskii in the late stationary phase fig 5a however the highest ndma concentration observed in this study was still lower than those reported previously by zhou et al 2015 and tsai et al 2019 for m aeruginosa 20 30 ng mg 1c while the net formation of both 14n 14n and 14n 15n labelled ndma increased with culture age except for 14n 14n ndma formed from c raciborskii the percentage of 14n 15n labelled ndma did not consistently increase with growth stage in contrast to the increase observed in 15n dcan formation with age post chloramination fig 3a and b this suggests that the contribution of 14nh2cl and 15n labelled algal don to ndma formation was similar for both the exponential and stationary phases again the exception was c raciborskii where the percentage of 14n 15n labelled ndma increased from 42 to 59 with algal age suggesting an increased contribution of 15n labelled algal don to total ndma formation fig 5b studies have demonstrated that ndma and other n nitrosamines form due to the reaction of organic amines like dimethylamine dma with monochloramine rather than free chlorine choi and valentine 2002 mitch and sedlak 2002b in this study the detection of n nitrosamines via chloramination but not during free chlorination experiments is in contrast to previous observations of 150 ng l 1 ndma concentration from m aeruginosa aom post chlorination attributed to the high din content in the species zhou et al 2015 the concentration of din in the m aeruginosa aom used in this study has been found to be lower li et al 2019 than that observed by zhou et al 2015 and could explain the absence of ndma post chlorination the molar yields of ndma formation from don during chloramination in the current study were less than 0 003 this result is much smaller than that measured in other formation potential studies which reported molar yields of 0 3 for ndma formation from amides with dma functional groups such as dimethylformamide and diuron and 2 5 molar yield for ndma formation from tertiary amines with dma functional groups chen and young 2008 mitch and sedlak 2004 zhou et al 2015 3 2 6 formation of other n nitrosamines unlabelled only from bulk aom as only unlabelled n nitrosamines other than ndma were measured concentrations presented in this study are likely to underestimate total n nitrosamine formation potentials because 15n labelled aom was used in these formation potential experiments as the ratios between 14n 15n labelled ndma and 14n 14n ndma differed among the four species quantitative comparison of n nitrosamine formation is not possible however the concentrations measured do provide information about trends in n nitrosamine formation and can be compared to unlabelled ndma formation all n nitrosamines were detected at least once from all the species fig 6 although unlabelled nmor 8 3 ng l 1 was only detected from one replicate of three of bulk aom from c vulgaris and c raciborskii and was therefore not considered further the most frequently detected 14n 14n n nitrosamines were ndma and ndea which were both formed by all species in each growth phase at least one n nitrosamine containing a longer c chain i e ndpa or ndba was also detected in all samples except d circinale in the stationary phase fig 6 formation of n nitrosamines containing heterocyclic structures nmor npip or npyr was more variable npip was detected in at least one stage for all algal species but npyr was only formed by c raciborskii c raciborskii had the highest total n nitrosamine concentration 0 52 nm stationary phase 0 34 nm late stationary phase and formed seven n nitrosamines in both growth stages with increased formation of ndma and nmea in the late stationary phase fig 6 while ndma is usually the predominant n nitrosamine species formed in studies of chloramination of surface waters bond et al 2011 krasner et al 2013 sacher and lee 2008a 14n 14n ndma formation from chloramination of bulk aom was less than formation of other 14n 14n n nitrosamines for example in the exponential phase the largest contributor to total unlabelled n nitrosamine formation was npip for c vulgaris 30 ndea for m aeruginosa 38 npip for d circinalis 31 and ndea for c raciborskii 26 with associated percentages for 14n 14n ndma being 8 16 20 and 9 respectively for the same species fig 6 however ndma concentrations increased with algal age for all the species while concentrations of all other n nitrosamines were the same or decreased ndma may also form from the degradation of larger symmetrical aliphatic n nitrosamines e g ndba ndpa ndea or from dma that has been formed from degradation of the r1 nh r2 structures before chloramination fang et al 2010b which may explain the increased ndma formation with algal age both c vulgaris and d circinale formed fewer different n nitrosamines in the stationary phase compared to the exponential phase and m aeruginosa was the only species which had an increase in the number of n nitrosamines detected with algal age fig 6 the formation of n nitrosamines other than ndma after chloramination is considered to occur by the same mechanisms as ndma formation from dma but with the secondary amine relevant for each corresponding n nitrosamine wang et al 2011 the greater formation of 14n 14n n nitrosamines other than 14n 14n ndma and particularly the formation of symmetrical aliphatic n nitrosamines e g ndba ndpa and ndea suggests that long c chain amine r1 nh r2 structures were more available than dma structures in aom the more variable formation of aromatic and heterocyclic n nitrosamines e g npip and npyr among the species suggests that aromatic and heterocyclic amine precursors were not present in aom of all algal species for example the lack of formation of npip npyr or nmor from d circinale aom suggests there were no similar ring structures of organic n in d circinale while precursors for the other n nitrosamines appear likely to be part of aom the relatively low formation of ndma suggests that ndma precursors are more likely to come from sources other than aom this is supported by a previous study that characterised aom from m aeruginosa fang et al 2010b and detected aliphatic amines such as ethylamine methylethylamine and diethylamine but not dimethylamine which is the main precursor for ndma 3 3 comparison of n dbp formation to health guidelines and occurrence in drinking water sources the n dbp formation in this study was measured using aom extracted from laboratory cultured algal cells which cannot be directly compared to current drinking water guidelines or occurrence values however algal derived n dbp concentrations can be estimated using a cell counts of the algal cultures used in this study and b highest formation of each n dbp in the relevant growth phase if it is assumed that an algal bloom has 1 105 cell ml 1 in the exponential growth phase and 1 106 cell ml 1 in the stationary phase the formation of dcan could be expected to reach a maximum of 1 μg l 1 for c vulgaris after chlorination or 0 4 μg l 1 for m aeruginosa after chloramination currently there are no health guidelines for dcan in the australian drinking water guidelines adwg 2011 but the who and us epa recommended drinking water guidelines for dcan are 20 μg l 1 and 6 μg l 1 respectively usepa 2007 hence the estimated maximum formation of dcan from either chlorination or chloramination of water impacted by an algal bloom of one or more of these algal species is well under these guideline values the estimated dcan concentration for algal impacted waters is generally lower than concentrations typically measured in real drinking water samples which have been reported in the range of tens of μg l 1 farre et al 2012 krasner et al 2007 mitch et al 2009 simpson and hayes 1998 while this suggests that aom cannot produce all dcan measured in real waters it is noted that the impact of other water quality parameters such as bromide on dbp formation from aom is not fully understood for example a recent study of n dbps in west australian drinking water systems found higher concentrations of brominated hans like dibromoacetonitrile and bromochloroacetonitrile rather than dcan and this was related to high bromide concentrations in the source waters liew et al 2016 in this study the role of bromide in dbp formation was not investigated but it is acknowledged that the presence of bromide could increase han formation and this requires further investigation the total formation of ndma after chloramination was estimated to be low at 12 ng l 1 based on the results from c raciborskii aom maximum the estimates presented here are within the ndma guideline value 100 ng l 1 for drinking water quality for australia adwg 2011 and the world health organization who 2017 but exceed the california department of public health level of 10 ng l 1 for ndma cdph 2016 a very low impact of algae on ndma concentrations 3 9 ng l 1 in chlorinated and chloraminated natural waters has been reported previously gerecke and sedlak 2003 mitch et al 2009 and this is also relatively low compared to many values reported for drinking water distribution systems where concentrations can reach hundreds of ng l 1 charrois et al 2004 sacher et al 2008b zhao et al 2008 however increased ndma concentrations in surface water are typically related to the presence of anthropogenic chemicals liew et al 2012 and the use of polymers eg pdadmac as coagulants liew et al 2015 thereby diluting the impact of aom on ndma formation if it is assumed that the concentration of unlabelled n nitrosamines measured in this study represent 50 of total formation other algal derived n nitrosamines could be estimated to be 10 ng l 1 for nema 11 ng l 1 for ndea 5 ng l 1 for ndpa 15 ng l 1 for ndba 8 ng l 1 for npyr and 9 ng l 1 for npip these estimated concentrations are typically higher than concentrations previously reported in drinking water systems for example the estimated concentrations for ndea and ndpa are higher than the 10 ng l 1 threshold concentrations of the california department of public health cdph 2016 npyr and nmor were 2 4 ng l 1 and 1 ng l 1 respectively in chloraminated canadian drinking water systems charrois et al 2004 while npyr 1 7 6 ng l 1 and nema 1 3 4 ng l 1 were measured in lab based formation potential experiments using chloramination of 81 river and lake raw water samples sacher and lee 2008a in six drinking water systems from the uk ndba and nmor were reported to be 11 6 and 42 8 ng l 1 respectively templeton and zhuo 2010 a recent study of n nitrosamines in western australia also found low concentrations 10 ng l 1 of ndpa ndba nmor and npyr in a chloraminated distribution system liew et al 2016 overall comparisons to previously measured n dbp concentrations in drinking water suggest that the aom extracted from the algae and cyanobacteria examined in this study are not likely to be major sources of precursors for either dcan or ndma in real waters 4 conclusions in this study n dbp formation potential from algae was analysed from three standpoints a from bulk and size fractionated aom of the commonly found cyanobacteria m aeruginosa b evaluating the impact of don character on n dbp formation and c identification of n source during n dbp formation via the novel approach of chloramination of 15n labelled aom the results provide a new understanding of aom derived n dbp formation specific conclusions are the aom from the commonly found cyanobacteria m aeruginosa produced only dcan after chlorination and dcan and eight n nitrosamines after chloramination m aeruginosa aom was the most susceptible to produce dcan after chloramination when compared to all the other species tested however the total dcan concentration from m aeruginosa aom post chloramination was still lower than that observed post chlorination dcan was the major n dbp that formed in the highest concentrations for both chlorination and chloramination for all the species with predicted formation pathways similar to those observed for other types of organic matter e g nom dcan formation was a function of species and growth stages of the culture culture age during both chlorination and chloramination hmw algal don 1 kda particularly the building block fraction 50 1 kda predominantly produced a higher dcan yield normalised to don than that from lmw 1 kda algal don as the concentrations of hmw algal don are known to increase with age dcan concentrations increase with algal growth suggesting that the proportion of hmw don could influence n dbp formation nmea ndea ndba and npip rather than ndma were the dominant n nitrosamine species formed during chloramination this suggests the precursors containing long c chain amine r1 nh r2 or aromatic n structures were more available than dimethylamine dma precursor of ndma in aom ndma formation increased with growth stage for all four species possibly due to the increasing concentrations of the hmw fraction of algal don with age however most other n nitrosamines except for those from m aeruginosa remained consistent or decreased with growth stage comparisons to previously measured n dbp concentrations in drinking water suggest that algae and cyanobacteria are not the major source of precursors for either dcan or ndma in drinking waters rather organic matter from sources such as treated wastewater effluent discharges and polymeric chemicals are the major sources for n dbp precursors for the other n nitrosamines aom particularly from c raciborskii may present a major precursor source that has not previously been identified as hmw algal don was observed to produce a higher dcan yield than lmw algal don future work on the development of a don doc index especially for the hmw fractions is recommended to potentially estimate n dbp concentrations declaration of competing interest the

17735,algal cells and algal organic matter aom are a source of high dissolved organic carbon doc and nitrogen don concentrations this poses a possible health risk due to their potential to form disinfection by products dbps some of which may be of health concern after disinfection while several studies have focussed on the formation of carbonaceous dbps from aom only a few studies have focussed on the formation of nitrogen containing n dbps from aom hence the main aim of this study was to thoroughly investigate the n dbp formation potential of the aom from a species of cyanobacteria commonly found in natural waters microcystis aeruginosa three haloacetonitriles two halonitromethanes two haloacetamides and eight n nitrosamines were analysed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry after chlorination and chloramination of the extracted aom to provide further insight into the influence of changing don character on n dbp formation potential the aom from three other species chlorella vulgaris dolichospermum circinale and cylindrospermopsis raciborskii were also tested dichloroacetonitrile dcan was the dbp formed in the highest concentrations for both chlorination and chloramination of bulk aom from all the species furthermore during chlorination and chloramination the high molecular weight fraction 1 kda of aom from m aeruginosa had a greater dcan formation potential normalised to doc or don than the aom in the low molecular weight fraction 1 kda of m aeruginosa regardless of growth stage n nitrosamine formation from the bulk aom of all species occurred only after chloramination the molar concentration of n nitrosodimethylamine ndma was lower than the other n nitrosamines detected however ndma formation increased with culture age for all four species in contrast to most other n nitrosamines whose formation remained consistent or decreased with culture age overall algal growth could result in elevated concentrations of n dbps due to the increasing concentrations of high molecular weight algal don in the aom it is suggested that the aom comprises precursors containing long c chain amine r1 nh r2 or cyclic n containing amine structures comparisons to previously measured n dbp concentrations in drinking water suggest that the aom from the algae and cyanobacteria examined in this study are not likely to be a major source of precursors for either dcan or ndma in real waters however aom may present a major precursor source for other n nitrosamines graphical abstract image 1 keywords algal organic matter dbp formation ndma dcan 1 introduction the presence of algae and cyanobacteria in raw waters can present a significant challenge for water treatment operators if downstream treatment processes are ineffective residual cells and algal derived organic matter aom can react with chemical disinfectants forming disinfection by products dbps and these are often carbon based c dbps and nitrogen based n dbps pivokonsky et al 2016 previous investigations of dbp formation from disinfection of algae laden waters have largely focussed on the formation of c dbps such as trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas chen et al 2017 dong et al 2019b gu et al 2020 hua et al 2018 liu et al 2018 pivokonsky et al 2016 zhao et al 2020 zhou et al 2015 for example variations in c dbp formation from algal sources has been studied extensively by conducting disinfection experiments on cells zhao et al 2020 intra and extra cellular organic matter dong et al 2019b zhao et al 2020 and algae of different growth stages chen et al 2017 hua et al 2018 as well as using varying disinfectant concentrations gu et al 2020 and different disinfectants gu et al 2020 liu et al 2018 2019 recently n dbps have been considered to be a greater human health risk than the c dbps prompting further investigation of n dbps as a priority dong et al 2019a goslan et al 2017 liu et al 2018 richardson et al 2007 a number of studies have investigated the formation of n dbps from precursors that originate from microalgal cells qi et al 2016 xu et al 2017 and bulk unfractionated aom dong et al 2019a fang et al 2010b goslan et al 2017 hua et al 2019 qi et al 2016 xu et al 2017 while understanding n dbp formation from cells is important a greater focus has been placed on n dbp formation from the aom because water treatment processes are typically designed to minimise cell lysis to prevent the release of toxins and organic compounds from inside the cells into the water li et al 2012 lui et al 2012 pivokonsky et al 2016 sun et al 2018 zhou et al 2015 furthermore there is high cell removal but poor to moderate aom removal in water treatment processes which results in the presence of aom in the treated water during the disinfection stage henderson et al 2010 in light of this goslan et al 2017 compared the aom from a few algae such as scenedesmus subspicatus anabaena flos aquae microcystis aeruginosa for dcan formation after disinfection with chlorine and reported that the bulk aom of m aeruginosa formed the highest concentration of dcan in other studies formation of some haloacetonitriles hans haloacetamides haams and or n nitrosodimethylamine ndma were evaluated from chlorination and or chloramination of bulk or fractionated aom extracted from a few algal species lui et al 2012 sun et al 2018 zhou et al 2015 however it is known that aom character can vary widely between species and therefore it is anticipated that n dbp formation potential may also vary there is limited to no information available on the formation of a wide spectrum of n dbps such as halonitromethanes hnms haams and n nitrosamines other than ndma from both chlorination and chloramination of bulk and fractionated aom with very differing character as these n dbps have been observed to form from the organic matter present in natural waters and result in cyto and geno toxicity alexandrou et al 2018 bond et al 2012 ding et al 2019 fang et al 2018 further research on their formation from differing aom is needed overall there is still a lack of understanding on how aom including the fractions within that aom from a range of species with differing character contributes to the formation of n dbps beyond ndma and a few hans or haams studies investigating n dbp formation during chloramination can have additional challenges as n transfer to the dbp may occur from organic n compounds or the chloramine disinfectant yang et al 2010 this has been resolved by using 15n labelled monochloramine which has helped delineate n transfer from monochloramine to the dbp via a specific mechanism aldehyde pathway in studies that used unlabelled aom le roux et al 2016 drinking water chuang et al 2013 chuang and tung 2015 and wastewater huang et al 2012 however the application of the 15n labelled monochloramine has its limitations as it only evaluates dbp formation via one specific mechanism aldehyde pathway in relation to other dbp formation mechanisms that are equally probable for eg decarboxylation pathway linge et al 2020 vu et al 2018 yang et al 2010 as the n dbp formation from aom can occur via different mechanisms goslan et al 2017 krasner et al 2007 qi et al 2016 using 15n labelled don would be novel and beneficial in tracking the source of n in the n dbps the aims of this study were therefore threefold a to examine in detail for the first time the bulk and fractionated aom of the commonly found cyanobacteria in natural waters m aeruginosa for n dbp formation potential under both chlorination and chloramination conditions including analysis of three hans two hnms two haams and eight n nitrosamines bulk aom only b to illustrate the impact of variations in don character on n dbp formation potential during chlorination and chloramination by examining n dbp formation from the bulk aom of three more species dolichospermum circinale cylindrospermopsis raciborskii and chlorella vulgaris and c to identify whether n was sourced from organic n or monochloramine during n dbp formation via the novel approach of chloramination of 15n labelled aom 2 materials and methods 2 1 cultivation of algae and preparation of aom three cyanobacteria m aeruginosa cs 555 01 d circinale formerly a circinalis cs 533 02 and c raciborskii cs 508 and one green algae c vulgaris cs 42 7 were obtained from the australian national algae culture collection csiro hobart tasmania and sub cultured in 250 ml flasks containing 100 ml each of sterilised mla for cyanobacteria and jaworski for green algae media respectively li et al 2019 additionally to determine n dbp formation pathways during chloramination 15n labelled species were grown in media containing 15n labelled sodium nitrate sigma aldrich 98 for two culture cycles to ensure that 14n labelled sodium nitrate from previous culturing cycles was completely replaced the 15n contents were 82 4 and 98 7 of tn for 15n labelled jaworski and mla media respectively si table s2 1 for the extraction of dissolved aom two time points in the exponential growth phase and the stationary growth phase were selected which corresponded to day 11 12 and day 20 21 respectively si figure s2 1 for all species except c raciborskii cs 508 which had a lower rate of nitrate depletion and aom production for this species the aom was extracted in the stationary and late stationary growth phases instead corresponding to days 20 21 and days 30 31 respectively in all cases the aom was extracted by subjecting the cultures to a two step filtration process using first a 1 2 μm filter and then a 0 45 μm filter the bulk aom 0 45 μm was further separated into different size fractions using ultrafiltration and the sizes of these fractions were verified and further characterised using liquid chromatography with organic carbon and nitrogen detection lc ocnd model 8 doc labor germany as discussed further in si s2 2 2 the cut off sizes of the membranes were 50 kda and 1 kda resulting in the following aom fractions a 0 45 μm bulk aom control sample b 0 45 μm 50 kda high molecular weight hmw biopolymers c 50 1 kda hmw building blocks and d 1 kda low molecular weight lmw the terms building blocks and biopolymers have been operationally defined by huber et al 2011 all the aom fractions were adjusted to 2 mg c l 1 as doc before undertaking characterisation or n dbp formation potential experiments except when the aom fractions contained 2 mg c l 1 doc as was the case for c raciborskii where the experiments were undertaken using solutions of 1 mg c l 1 2 2 organic carbon and nitrogen characterisation total don concentrations in the bulk and size fractionated aom samples were determined by first analysing the total dissolved nitrogen tn concentration using a shimadzu toc vcsh tnm 1 analyser japan and then measuring the dissolved inorganic nitrogen din concentration using the lc ocnd system the don concentration was then determined by subtracting the din concentration from the tn concentration a method validated by li et al 2019 and referred to henceforth as the tn din method the doc concentrations were measured using the shimadzu toc vcsh tnm 1 analyser japan 2 3 aom disinfection experiments chlorination experiments on the bulk and size fractionated aom were undertaken using free chlorine chloramination experiments were undertaken using 15n labelled aom bulk and fractionated and pre formed monochloramine in order to evaluate the maximum potential for n dbp formation from the aom chlorine was added in excess and longer reaction times than that used in water treatment plants were applied carranzo 2012 sun et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 zhou et al 2015 all disinfection experiments were conducted at ph 7 and maintained at 21 c in the dark for 72 h all experiments were conducted in triplicate si section s2 3 provides full details on the aom disinfection experiments 2 4 analysis of n dbps as m aeruginosa is one of the most common species found in natural waters bowling et al 2016 paerl and otten 2013 its aom was subject to the most intense examination including the n dbp formation potential for three hans two hnms two haams and eight n nitrosamines by gc ms tables 1 and si tables s2 2 and s2 3 to provide further insight into the influence of changing don character the aom from the other species were tested for n dbp formation potential as identified in table 1 hnms and haams were measured based on the procedure of liew et al 2012 hans were analysed based on the procedure outlined by kristiana et al 2012 and n nitrosamines were analysed following mcdonald et al 2012 in all cases surrogate standards deuterated n dbps were added to each sample prior to sample extraction while internal standards were added after sample preparation to monitor instrument performance si section s2 4 1 provides complete details on n dbp analytical protocols 3 results and discussion 3 1 n dbp formation following chlorination of aom after 72 h of chlorination dcan and tcan were the only n dbps detected in either bulk or fractionated aom from the four species m aeruginosa cs 555 01 d circinale cs 533 02 c raciborskii cs 508 and c vulgaris cs 42 7 3 1 1 dichloroacetonitrile dcan formation from bulk aom the normalised dcan concentration from the bulk aom ranged from 0 24 0 02 to 1 06 0 03 μg mg 1c and 1 95 0 13 to 16 7 0 43 μg mg 1n depending on the species and growth phase fig 1 these dcan formation potentials are consistent with previous reports of chlorination of aom producing 0 3 1 4 μg mg 1c for m aeruginosa fang et al 2010b goslan et al 2017 liu et al 2018 ma et al 2017 yang et al 2011 and 0 4 2 2 μg mg 1c for c vulgaris huang et al 2013 yang et al 2011 the highest normalised dcan formation was from the green algae c vulgaris followed by d circinale m aeruginosa and c raciborskii fig 1 this was in contrast to the findings of goslan et al 2017 who reported that the british strain of m aeruginosa produced three six times more dcan upon chlorination when compared to the green algae tested suggesting that the total dcan formation could be dependent on the character of the bulk aom which in turn is species and strain dependent normalised dcan concentrations increased with culture age for all algal species studied similar to the results observed by yang et al 2011 who observed a ten fold increase in dcan concentrations by day 30 during the disinfection of aom from m aeruginosa and c vulgaris chinese strains this suggests that changes in don and doc character between the exponential and stationary phases or stationary and late stationary phases for c raciborski results in an increase in dcan formation this was particularly apparent for the aom of c raciborski and c vulgaris which had a 147 and 40 increase in don normalised dcan concentration fig 1 respectively indicating that the aom released in the late stationary phase was a more potent dcan precursor therefore water treatment plant operators have to take precautions to mitigate risks associated with dcan formation as greater aom concentrations have been observed following the stationary and late stationary phases during the death of algal blooms 3 1 2 dcan formation from size fractionated aom the normalised dcan concentrations from size fractionated aom are shown in fig 2 a and b it is evident that the trends observed in fig 2a and b were similar to those observed in fig 1 thereby giving confidence in the two sets of results one on bulk aom and the other on the same aom fractionated out of the total normalised dcan both doc and don normalised more than 50 was from the hmw 0 45 μm 50 kda biopolymer and 50 1 kda building blocks fractions for all species and growth phases except for c raciborskii in the stationary phase where these hmw fractions produced 48 dcan when normalised to don fig 2b moreover the contribution of hmw aom to the total dcan formation increased with culture age for all species except for d circinale which showed similar dcan normalised to doc and don formation in the hmw fraction irrespective of the age fig 2a and b these comparisons suggest hmw 1 kda rather than lmw 1 kda aom had a greater reactivity for dcan formation at all stages of growth dcan formation from the hmw fractions was also species and age dependent for instance the dcan formation normalised to don in the building blocks fractions of aom from c vulgaris and m aeruginosa was 20 and 28 respectively in the exponential growth phase and 39 in the building blocks fractions of aom from both organisms in the stationary growth phase fig 2b for six of the eight cases shown in fig 2b dcan formation in the building blocks fraction was comparable or greater than that in the biopolymer fraction when normalised to don this was more apparent when the cultures aged thereby suggesting that the don in the aged algal building blocks fraction was more active in forming dcan than that in the biopolymer fraction during chlorination at this juncture it is also important to note that while the bulk or fractionated aom of m aeruginosa in the stationary phase had a high propensity to produce dcan the dcan formation from m aeruginosa was considerably lower than other species such as c vulgaris or d circinale a number of dcan precursors such as heterocyclic n in nucleic acids proteinaceous materials and amino acids such as aspartic acid and tryptophan bound to humic structures have been identified previously bond et al 2009 2012 and in the aom they have largely been associated with the building blocks and biopolymers fractions li et al 2019 when chlorine is present in excess i e cl n 2 m m dcan formation from amino acids or peptides is proposed to occur by the decarboxylation pathway si figure s3 1 which involves chlorination of n terminal amino groups bond et al 2012 deborde and von gunten 2008 hureiki et al 1994 joo and mitch 2007 after dichlorination of the terminal amino acid a nitrile is formed from elimination of hydrochloric acid and subsequent decarboxylation bond et al 2012 the electron withdrawing nature of the nitrile can promote further dichlorination of the α c atom producing dichlorocyanoacetic acid which in turn liberates dcan upon decarboxylation mitch et al 2009 this pathway from n terminal amino groups has also been proposed previously for dcan formation from chlorinated aom fang et al 2010b goslan et al 2017 nihemaiti et al 2015 in the current study the cl n ratios m m in bulk and fractionated aom experiments varied from 5 6 to 40 during chlorination and also during chloramination see section 3 2 therefore amino acid like moieties from algal peptides or from degraded algal biopolymers or building blocks are likely to become dichlorinated and potentially undergo the decarboxylation pathway to form dcan nihemaiti et al 2015 3 1 3 formation of other hans no tcan was detected from the aom of m aeruginosa in any of the growth phases however tcan was detected from other organisms in either the stationary phase aom from c vulgaris and d circinale or the later stationary phase aom from c raciborskii which suggested that tcan formation could increase with algal age the tcan concentrations normalised to doc ranged from 0 02 to 0 06 μg mg 1c depending on the species and fractions sitable s3 1 which was much lower than dcan formation fig 1 however low tcan concentrations may have also been caused by the inherent instability of tcan at ph 5 5 where tcan can undergo base catalysed hydrolysis farre et al 2012 goslan et al 2017 kristiana et al 2014 or higher rates of hydrolysis when exposed to residual chlorine glezer et al 1999 oliver 1983 in this study chlorination experiments were buffered at ph 7 and the free chlorine residual after chlorination for 72 h was typically 4 6 mg l 1 3 1 4 other n dbp classes no formation of hnms haams or n nitrosamines was detected above the respective lods from the chlorinated bulk aom for any of the four species tested at either growth phase sitable s2 2 the absence of hnm formation in this study is in contrast to previous studies which have reported low tcnm concentrations 0 03 0 27 μg mg 1c after chlorination from both cell suspensions and aom of m aeruginosa fang et al 2010a goslan et al 2017 yang et al 2011 there is little published information regarding haam formation from chlorinated aom zhang et al 2017 it has been reported that 0 03 μg l 1 0 1 μg mg 1 c of dcaam formed from chlorinated algal eps of chlorella huang et al 2012 this value is below the lod of dcaam analysis in this study 0 1 μg l 1 previous studies on n nitrosamine formation from chlorinated m aeruginosa have reported values ranging from 7 to 13 ng mg 1c fang et al 2010b ma et al 2017 however these studies used cells and aom from a late exponential phase and the doc concentrations were 2 mg l 1 used in this study 3 2 n dbp formation after chloramination of 15n labelled aom after 72 h of chloramination one of the three hans dcan was detected from both bulk and size fractionated 15n labelled aom and seven of the eight n nitrosamines measured were detected from the bulk 15n labelled aom from all four species in all the growth phases the eighth n nitrosamine nmor was only detected from one replicate of three of bulk aom of c vulgaris and c raciborskii 3 2 1 dcan formation from bulk 15n labelled aom the total dcan concentration i e sum of 14n and 15n labelled dcan from bulk aom increased with culture age when normalised to doc or don fig 3 a and b unlike dcan formation post chlorination m aeruginosa produced the highest normalised dcan concentrations followed by c raciborskii c vulgaris and d circinale when compared at the same growth stage suggesting that the m aeruginosa aom had a higher reactivity for dcan formation than the other three species under chloramination conditions the normalised dcan concentrations of the bulk aom from m aeruginosa and c vulgaris in the stationary phase were 0 34 0 01 μg mg 1c and 0 16 0 02 μg mg 1c fig 3a respectively and were comparable or lower than previously reported values of 0 4 μg mg 1c for m aeruginosa late stationary phase day 42 fang et al 2010b and 0 18 μg mg 1c and 0 22 μg mg 1c for c vulgaris cells yang et al 2011 and extracellular organic matter huang et al 2013 respectively when considering 14n and 15n labelled dcan individually 14n labelled dcan made up between 73 and 98 of total dcan fig 3a indicating that most of the n in the dcan originated from the monochloramine disinfectant 14nh2cl rather than the 15n labelled aom this result is consistent with previous studies which reported the nh2cl contribution to the n in dcan to be 60 during chloramination on algal extracellular organic matter huang et al 2012 and 70 during chloramination of nom yang et al 2010 suggesting that the dcan formation mechanism during chloramination of aom is comparable to the formation mechanism from other nom precursors despite the generally higher formation of 14n labelled dcan the percentage of 15n labelled dcan did increase with culture age irrespective of doc or don normalisation and across all the species fig 3a and b this suggests that an increasing proportion of 15n labelled aom acts as a precursor for dcan as the culture ages either due to ongoing 15n assimilation from the media or internal conversion of 15n labelled aom to more reactive dcan precursors the maximum incorporation of 15n into total dcan during chloramination of bulk aom was from bulk d circinale 27 2 normalised to doc 29 2 normalised to don fig 3a and b while it is possible that 14n was incorporated into aom during cell culturing with the 15n labelled media it is still most likely that the majority of 14n incorporated into dcan up to 73 originated from unlabelled ammonium chloride nh2cl used to prepare the monochloramine and this agrees with a previous study of dcan formation from unlabelled organic matter and 15n labelled nh2cl huang et al 2012 which showed that more than 70 of n incorporated in dcan was from the monochloramine when reacted with either chlorella extracellular organic matter samples or standard nom reference materials yang et al 2010 also found that up to 92 of n incorporated in dcan originated from monochloramine during chloramination of suwannee river nom with dcan formation linearly increasing with monochloramine dose 3 2 2 dcan formation from size fractionated 15n labelled aom normalised dcan concentrations post chloramination of 15n labelled aom size fractions varied with species and also increased with culture age fig 4 a and b similar to dcan formation after chlorination more than 50 of total normalised dcan from bulk aom resulted from the hmw fractions except for c vulgaris and c raciborskii in the stationary phase where their hmw fractions produced 48 and 45 of the total dcan when normalised to doc fig 4a in addition the dcan concentrations from individual 15n labelled aom fractions in the latter growth stages were different when normalised by either doc or don for example when normalised to doc the lmw fraction was the highest contributor to total dcan formation for three species 52 for c vulgaris 44 for m aeruginosa and 43 for d circinale fig 4a the exception was c raciborskii which had higher contributions from the building blocks 35 and biopolymer 33 fractions this was mainly caused by the relative increase of the proportion of dcan formation from the biopolymer fraction 15 33 when the c raciborskii cultures aged fig 4a when normalised to don the hmw don produced proportionally more dcan than lmw don after chloramination of all species fig 4b for instance d circinale had 54 of total dcan formation from the building blocks fraction additionally the biopolymer fraction of c raciborskii showed the greatest increase in proportional dcan formation of 19 for an individual fraction as the culture aged fig 4b interestingly hmw don was also observed to produce proportionally more dcan during chlorination fig 2b thereby suggesting that dcan production via chlorination or chloramination was a function of the proportion of hmw don in the aom as observed for the unlabelled 14n and 15n labelled dcan formation from the bulk aom a greater proportion of unlabelled dcan 75 95 of total dcan was produced in the fractions upon chloramination compared to the 15n labelled dcan figure s3 2 this again indicates that n was mainly incorporated from the monochloramine disinfectant 14nh2cl rather than the 15n labelled aom precursors the percentage of 15n labelled dcan increased with algal age for all the fractions in addition the percentage of 15n labelled dcan was consistently higher for the lmw fraction than the biopolymers or building blocks fractions when normalised to doc or don for instance the don normalised proportions of 15n labelled dcan in total dcan in the lmw and building blocks fractions were 18 and 14 for c vulgaris 22 and 20 for m aeruginosa 26 and 14 for d circinale in the stationary phase and 10 and 8 for c raciborskii in the late stationary phase figure s3 2 a1 b1 c1 d1 these results suggest that lmw algal don may contain relatively more chloramine reactive 15n labelled dcan precursors than the other fractions this could be due to the breakdown of algal don from biopolymers and building blocks fractions to the lmw fractions fang et al 2010b pivokonsky et al 2016 resulting in several small molecules that were labelled with 15n 3 2 3 formation pathway of dcan from chloramination formation of dcan from chloramination has been suggested to occur either by the decarboxylation pathway where the n in dcan originates from the don precursor usually an amino acid sifigure s3 3 or the aldehyde pathway sifigure s3 3 where the n is incorporated from the monochloramine during reaction with an aldehyde bond et al 2014 shah and mitch 2012 the aldehyde precursor may be a functional group within aom or can be produced as an intermediate during reactions between organic compounds in the aom and the disinfectant yang et al 2010 given the relative proportions of unlabelled 14n and labelled 15n incorporated into dcan in this study it appears that the aldehyde pathway was the major formation pathway for dcan from amino acid functionalities within aom this pathway also provides a route for dcan formation from chloramination of non nitrogenous components through aldehyde groups in aom however the incorporation of some 15n into dcan does suggest that formation via the decarboxylation pathway occurs to a small extent 3 2 4 comparison of dcan formation from chlorination and chloramination for the bulk aom from all species the dcan concentration normalised to doc or don was between 1 3 and 12 times greater after chlorination than chloramination sifigure s3 4 this is consistent with many previous studies that have also found higher dcan formation post chlorination than chloramination of aom goslan et al 2017 huang et al 2012 zhu et al 2015 drinking water samples goslan et al 2009 kristiana et al 2012 and nom and n containing model compounds bond et al 2014 huang et al 2012 joo and mitch 2007 mitch and sedlak 2002b yang et al 2007 2010 with limited studies finding dcan formation higher after chloramination huang et al 2012 lee et al 2007 this suggests that the mechanism of dcan formation from aom may be comparable to other nom and model compound precursors with respect to the aom fractions there was a strong indication that more dcan was produced from hmw compounds than lmw compounds during both chlorination and chloramination because 29 out of 32 disinfection scenarios had a higher dcan formation from the hmw fraction 1 kda than the lmw fraction 1 kda figs 2 and 4 the three exceptions were dcan produced from lmw aom of c vulgaris fig 4a and c raciborskii figs 2b and 4a on day 20 and the dcan produced was only marginally greater 52 55 of total dcan than that produced from hmw aom these results are supported by previous research on a range of freshwater and marine algal and cyanobacterial species such as c vulgaris m aeruginosa alexandrium tamarense and chaetoceros affinis wherein higher dcan formation was reported in aom fractions with mw 1 kda when compared to fractions with mw 1 kda dong et al 2019a ma et al 2017 villacorte et al 2015 zhou et al 2015 overall these results reiterate that the character of aom influences its reactivity with the disinfectant 3 2 5 n nitrosodimethylamine ndma formation from bulk aom as n nitrosamines contain two n atoms their formation from 15n labelled aom and unlabelled monochloramine could potentially produce 14n 14n ndma 15n 15n labelled ndma or 14n 15n labelled ndma however previous studies of ndma formation have found that the nitroso group n typically comes from the monochloramine while the amino group n is from the organic matter source choi and valentine 2002 mitch and sedlak 2002a resulting in preferential formation of 14n 15n labelled ndma in this study 14n 14n ndma and 14n 15n labelled ndma were both detected but 15n 15n labelled ndma was not detected despite the expectation that 14n 15n labelled ndma would form preferentially most samples formed more 14n 14n ndma and the maximum 14n 15n labelled ndma formation 59 3 normalised to doc was during chloramination of aom from the late stationary phase for c raciborskii fig 5 this suggests that 14n was still incorporated into the aom even though the 15n proportion of total n in the mla and jaworski media were 98 7 and 82 4 respectively sitable s2 1 this could imply that the algae were still utilising external 14n sources possibly atmospheric n2 total ndma i e sum of 14n 14n ndma and 14n 15n labelled ndma was species dependent but increased with growth stage for all algal species irrespective of whether the ndma concentrations were normalised to doc or don fig 5a and b the lowest total ndma concentrations were from c vulgaris 0 83 1 3 ng mg 1c no 14n 15n labelled ndma detected and from the commonly found m aeruginosa 1 1 1 8 ng mg 1c 30 40 14n 15n labelled ndma detected fig 5a the highest total ndma concentration was 11 24 0 55 ng mg 1c and was observed from c raciborskii in the late stationary phase fig 5a however the highest ndma concentration observed in this study was still lower than those reported previously by zhou et al 2015 and tsai et al 2019 for m aeruginosa 20 30 ng mg 1c while the net formation of both 14n 14n and 14n 15n labelled ndma increased with culture age except for 14n 14n ndma formed from c raciborskii the percentage of 14n 15n labelled ndma did not consistently increase with growth stage in contrast to the increase observed in 15n dcan formation with age post chloramination fig 3a and b this suggests that the contribution of 14nh2cl and 15n labelled algal don to ndma formation was similar for both the exponential and stationary phases again the exception was c raciborskii where the percentage of 14n 15n labelled ndma increased from 42 to 59 with algal age suggesting an increased contribution of 15n labelled algal don to total ndma formation fig 5b studies have demonstrated that ndma and other n nitrosamines form due to the reaction of organic amines like dimethylamine dma with monochloramine rather than free chlorine choi and valentine 2002 mitch and sedlak 2002b in this study the detection of n nitrosamines via chloramination but not during free chlorination experiments is in contrast to previous observations of 150 ng l 1 ndma concentration from m aeruginosa aom post chlorination attributed to the high din content in the species zhou et al 2015 the concentration of din in the m aeruginosa aom used in this study has been found to be lower li et al 2019 than that observed by zhou et al 2015 and could explain the absence of ndma post chlorination the molar yields of ndma formation from don during chloramination in the current study were less than 0 003 this result is much smaller than that measured in other formation potential studies which reported molar yields of 0 3 for ndma formation from amides with dma functional groups such as dimethylformamide and diuron and 2 5 molar yield for ndma formation from tertiary amines with dma functional groups chen and young 2008 mitch and sedlak 2004 zhou et al 2015 3 2 6 formation of other n nitrosamines unlabelled only from bulk aom as only unlabelled n nitrosamines other than ndma were measured concentrations presented in this study are likely to underestimate total n nitrosamine formation potentials because 15n labelled aom was used in these formation potential experiments as the ratios between 14n 15n labelled ndma and 14n 14n ndma differed among the four species quantitative comparison of n nitrosamine formation is not possible however the concentrations measured do provide information about trends in n nitrosamine formation and can be compared to unlabelled ndma formation all n nitrosamines were detected at least once from all the species fig 6 although unlabelled nmor 8 3 ng l 1 was only detected from one replicate of three of bulk aom from c vulgaris and c raciborskii and was therefore not considered further the most frequently detected 14n 14n n nitrosamines were ndma and ndea which were both formed by all species in each growth phase at least one n nitrosamine containing a longer c chain i e ndpa or ndba was also detected in all samples except d circinale in the stationary phase fig 6 formation of n nitrosamines containing heterocyclic structures nmor npip or npyr was more variable npip was detected in at least one stage for all algal species but npyr was only formed by c raciborskii c raciborskii had the highest total n nitrosamine concentration 0 52 nm stationary phase 0 34 nm late stationary phase and formed seven n nitrosamines in both growth stages with increased formation of ndma and nmea in the late stationary phase fig 6 while ndma is usually the predominant n nitrosamine species formed in studies of chloramination of surface waters bond et al 2011 krasner et al 2013 sacher and lee 2008a 14n 14n ndma formation from chloramination of bulk aom was less than formation of other 14n 14n n nitrosamines for example in the exponential phase the largest contributor to total unlabelled n nitrosamine formation was npip for c vulgaris 30 ndea for m aeruginosa 38 npip for d circinalis 31 and ndea for c raciborskii 26 with associated percentages for 14n 14n ndma being 8 16 20 and 9 respectively for the same species fig 6 however ndma concentrations increased with algal age for all the species while concentrations of all other n nitrosamines were the same or decreased ndma may also form from the degradation of larger symmetrical aliphatic n nitrosamines e g ndba ndpa ndea or from dma that has been formed from degradation of the r1 nh r2 structures before chloramination fang et al 2010b which may explain the increased ndma formation with algal age both c vulgaris and d circinale formed fewer different n nitrosamines in the stationary phase compared to the exponential phase and m aeruginosa was the only species which had an increase in the number of n nitrosamines detected with algal age fig 6 the formation of n nitrosamines other than ndma after chloramination is considered to occur by the same mechanisms as ndma formation from dma but with the secondary amine relevant for each corresponding n nitrosamine wang et al 2011 the greater formation of 14n 14n n nitrosamines other than 14n 14n ndma and particularly the formation of symmetrical aliphatic n nitrosamines e g ndba ndpa and ndea suggests that long c chain amine r1 nh r2 structures were more available than dma structures in aom the more variable formation of aromatic and heterocyclic n nitrosamines e g npip and npyr among the species suggests that aromatic and heterocyclic amine precursors were not present in aom of all algal species for example the lack of formation of npip npyr or nmor from d circinale aom suggests there were no similar ring structures of organic n in d circinale while precursors for the other n nitrosamines appear likely to be part of aom the relatively low formation of ndma suggests that ndma precursors are more likely to come from sources other than aom this is supported by a previous study that characterised aom from m aeruginosa fang et al 2010b and detected aliphatic amines such as ethylamine methylethylamine and diethylamine but not dimethylamine which is the main precursor for ndma 3 3 comparison of n dbp formation to health guidelines and occurrence in drinking water sources the n dbp formation in this study was measured using aom extracted from laboratory cultured algal cells which cannot be directly compared to current drinking water guidelines or occurrence values however algal derived n dbp concentrations can be estimated using a cell counts of the algal cultures used in this study and b highest formation of each n dbp in the relevant growth phase if it is assumed that an algal bloom has 1 105 cell ml 1 in the exponential growth phase and 1 106 cell ml 1 in the stationary phase the formation of dcan could be expected to reach a maximum of 1 μg l 1 for c vulgaris after chlorination or 0 4 μg l 1 for m aeruginosa after chloramination currently there are no health guidelines for dcan in the australian drinking water guidelines adwg 2011 but the who and us epa recommended drinking water guidelines for dcan are 20 μg l 1 and 6 μg l 1 respectively usepa 2007 hence the estimated maximum formation of dcan from either chlorination or chloramination of water impacted by an algal bloom of one or more of these algal species is well under these guideline values the estimated dcan concentration for algal impacted waters is generally lower than concentrations typically measured in real drinking water samples which have been reported in the range of tens of μg l 1 farre et al 2012 krasner et al 2007 mitch et al 2009 simpson and hayes 1998 while this suggests that aom cannot produce all dcan measured in real waters it is noted that the impact of other water quality parameters such as bromide on dbp formation from aom is not fully understood for example a recent study of n dbps in west australian drinking water systems found higher concentrations of brominated hans like dibromoacetonitrile and bromochloroacetonitrile rather than dcan and this was related to high bromide concentrations in the source waters liew et al 2016 in this study the role of bromide in dbp formation was not investigated but it is acknowledged that the presence of bromide could increase han formation and this requires further investigation the total formation of ndma after chloramination was estimated to be low at 12 ng l 1 based on the results from c raciborskii aom maximum the estimates presented here are within the ndma guideline value 100 ng l 1 for drinking water quality for australia adwg 2011 and the world health organization who 2017 but exceed the california department of public health level of 10 ng l 1 for ndma cdph 2016 a very low impact of algae on ndma concentrations 3 9 ng l 1 in chlorinated and chloraminated natural waters has been reported previously gerecke and sedlak 2003 mitch et al 2009 and this is also relatively low compared to many values reported for drinking water distribution systems where concentrations can reach hundreds of ng l 1 charrois et al 2004 sacher et al 2008b zhao et al 2008 however increased ndma concentrations in surface water are typically related to the presence of anthropogenic chemicals liew et al 2012 and the use of polymers eg pdadmac as coagulants liew et al 2015 thereby diluting the impact of aom on ndma formation if it is assumed that the concentration of unlabelled n nitrosamines measured in this study represent 50 of total formation other algal derived n nitrosamines could be estimated to be 10 ng l 1 for nema 11 ng l 1 for ndea 5 ng l 1 for ndpa 15 ng l 1 for ndba 8 ng l 1 for npyr and 9 ng l 1 for npip these estimated concentrations are typically higher than concentrations previously reported in drinking water systems for example the estimated concentrations for ndea and ndpa are higher than the 10 ng l 1 threshold concentrations of the california department of public health cdph 2016 npyr and nmor were 2 4 ng l 1 and 1 ng l 1 respectively in chloraminated canadian drinking water systems charrois et al 2004 while npyr 1 7 6 ng l 1 and nema 1 3 4 ng l 1 were measured in lab based formation potential experiments using chloramination of 81 river and lake raw water samples sacher and lee 2008a in six drinking water systems from the uk ndba and nmor were reported to be 11 6 and 42 8 ng l 1 respectively templeton and zhuo 2010 a recent study of n nitrosamines in western australia also found low concentrations 10 ng l 1 of ndpa ndba nmor and npyr in a chloraminated distribution system liew et al 2016 overall comparisons to previously measured n dbp concentrations in drinking water suggest that the aom extracted from the algae and cyanobacteria examined in this study are not likely to be major sources of precursors for either dcan or ndma in real waters 4 conclusions in this study n dbp formation potential from algae was analysed from three standpoints a from bulk and size fractionated aom of the commonly found cyanobacteria m aeruginosa b evaluating the impact of don character on n dbp formation and c identification of n source during n dbp formation via the novel approach of chloramination of 15n labelled aom the results provide a new understanding of aom derived n dbp formation specific conclusions are the aom from the commonly found cyanobacteria m aeruginosa produced only dcan after chlorination and dcan and eight n nitrosamines after chloramination m aeruginosa aom was the most susceptible to produce dcan after chloramination when compared to all the other species tested however the total dcan concentration from m aeruginosa aom post chloramination was still lower than that observed post chlorination dcan was the major n dbp that formed in the highest concentrations for both chlorination and chloramination for all the species with predicted formation pathways similar to those observed for other types of organic matter e g nom dcan formation was a function of species and growth stages of the culture culture age during both chlorination and chloramination hmw algal don 1 kda particularly the building block fraction 50 1 kda predominantly produced a higher dcan yield normalised to don than that from lmw 1 kda algal don as the concentrations of hmw algal don are known to increase with age dcan concentrations increase with algal growth suggesting that the proportion of hmw don could influence n dbp formation nmea ndea ndba and npip rather than ndma were the dominant n nitrosamine species formed during chloramination this suggests the precursors containing long c chain amine r1 nh r2 or aromatic n structures were more available than dimethylamine dma precursor of ndma in aom ndma formation increased with growth stage for all four species possibly due to the increasing concentrations of the hmw fraction of algal don with age however most other n nitrosamines except for those from m aeruginosa remained consistent or decreased with growth stage comparisons to previously measured n dbp concentrations in drinking water suggest that algae and cyanobacteria are not the major source of precursors for either dcan or ndma in drinking waters rather organic matter from sources such as treated wastewater effluent discharges and polymeric chemicals are the major sources for n dbp precursors for the other n nitrosamines aom particularly from c raciborskii may present a major precursor source that has not previously been identified as hmw algal don was observed to produce a higher dcan yield than lmw algal don future work on the development of a don doc index especially for the hmw fractions is recommended to potentially estimate n dbp concentrations declaration of competing interest the

water affects the biofilm structure and subsequently the membrane performance indicators in reverse osmosis ro and nanofiltration nf modules biofilm structure has been studied since the early 1990s using microscopic techniques at a microscale some of the principal drawbacks of applying the commonly used microscopic techniques to study membrane biofouling are that these techniques are mainly destructive with a low axial resolution and with limitations in laser penetration neu et al 2010 however in recent years more focus has been directed towards understanding and analyzing biofilm structures at mesoscale optical coherence tomography oct is a non disruptive imaging technique that recently gained attention in biofilm research blauert et al 2015 oct is capable of imaging in situ spatially resolved structures on a millimeter scale with a micrometer resolution therefore oct is used to compare the structural properties of biofilms such as density porosity thickness roughness spatial distribution grown at different nutritional conditions studies have shown that varying the nutrient concentration in the feed water influences the structural properties of biofilms affecting membrane performance parameters derlon et al 2012 desmond et al 2018 several studies have been carried out to characterize biofouling development while limiting either carbon or phosphorus concentration in the feed water allan et al 2002 desmond et al 2018 however the effect of restricting both carbon and phosphorous on biofilm development and its impact on the membrane system has not yet been investigated the objective of this study was to examine the impact of reducing the phosphorus concentration to a low concentration 0 3 μg p l 1 on biofilm development in ro systems at two dosed assimilable organic carbon concentrations 250 and 30 μg c l 1 morphology and composition of the developed biofilms were examined under phosphorus restricted p restricted 0 3 μg p l 1 and dosed p dosed 3 and 25 μg p l 1 conditions the effect of varying the nutrient load on membrane system performance feed channel pressure drop was monitored to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the biofouling problem and therefore its control 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup a lab scale experimental setup representative to the practical operation of spiral wound membrane systems was used for this study bucs et al 2016 a cross flow channel comprising of a membrane sheet and feed flow channel called membrane fouling simulator mfs was used for this experiment vrouwenvelder et al 2007 the setup consisted of a feed water pump a feed flow meter and controller a biodegradable nutrient dosage system pump and controller a membrane fouling simulator a back pressure valve bronkhorst ruurlo netherlands and a differential pressure sensor delta bar pmd75 endress hauser switzerland to monitor the pressure drop over the flow channel the system was fed by potable tap water produced by the king abdullah university of science and technology seawater desalination plant thuwal jeddah saudi arabia because the tap water is chlorinated the feed water was filtered by an activated carbon filter filter housing model ups bb3 awf ups 3h 20b cartridges model sediment carbon ac sc 10 nl to remove the residual chlorine and by two cartridge filters pore size 4 μm to remove any particles entering the feed water from the carbon filter for this study reverse osmosis produced tap water was selected to ensure an extremely low phosphorus content earlier work farhat et al 2018 has shown that dosage of biodegradable nutrients to various water types provided the same bacterial growth yield in seawater as the bacterial growth yield in tap water therefore the results presented in this paper are representative for seawater biofouling as well the original mfs has been modified to include an optical glass sight window to allow in situ oct imaging the mfs uses a membrane with the dimensions of 20 cm 3 5 cm a 34 mil 864 μm thick feed channel spacer taken from a new commercially available spiral wound membrane element tw30 4040 dow filmtec usa the mfs has an inlet and outlet sides allowing cross flow operation and two orifices for different pressure measurements the system and water characteristics are representative of biofilm studies as previously reported by farhat et al 2019 2 2 operating conditions the system was operated at a constant pressure of two bar in cross flow mode the feed water was pumped through the mfs at a flow rate of 17 l h 1 equivalents to a linear flow velocity of 0 18 m s 1 which is representative for practical membrane filtration installations bucs et al 2016 the tap water feeding the mfs had a phosphorus concentration of 0 3 μg p l 1 table 1 shows the experimental conditions a nutrient stock solution containing sodium acetate sodium nitrate and sodium phosphate in a mass ratio of c n p of 100 20 10 and 100 20 0 was prepared for p dosed and p restricted conditions respectively the nutrient stock solution was added to the feed water to enhance biofilm growth in the flow cell increasing the assimilable organic carbon concentration of the feed water by 250 μg c l 1 and 30 μg c l 1 chemicals from sigma aldrich darmstadt germany were purchased in analytical grade the ph value was set at 11 by the addition of sodium hydroxide to restrict bacterial growth in the nutrient stock solution the feed water flow rate was high 17 0 l h 1 compared to the dosing flow rate of the nutrient solution 0 03 l h 1 consequently the high ph value of the nutrient solution did not affect the feed water ph of 7 8 farhat et al 2019 two fully independent membrane fouling simulators n 2 were run for each set of experiments and the figures show the average and standard deviation 2 3 phosphorus concentration in the feed water to quantify low concentrations of ortho phosphate a low detection auto analyzer using a colorimetric based method was applied seal autoanalyser 3 hr seal analytical germany following the proposed protocol by murphy and riley 1962 the phosphorus concentration reported in this study was calculated from the obtained ortho phosphate concentration triplicate feed water samples were processed for the p restricted water the phosphorus concentration was below the detection limit using the colorimetric auto analyzer method 0 3 μg p l 1 for the p dosed water the measured phosphorus concentrations 26 0 and 3 5 μg p l 1 were in good agreement with the dosed phosphorus concentrations 25 0 μg p l 1 and 3 0 μg p l 1 respectively 2 4 fouling monitoring 2 4 1 system performance parameters feed channel pressure drop two sets of experiments one for each carbon concentration consisting of four membrane fouling simulators were run in parallel fouling development was monitored by measuring the feed channel pressure drop over the length of the flow cell the average initial pressure drop registered in each mfs was 27 4 mbar for both carbon concentrations experiments stopped once a feed channel pressure drop increase of 150 mbar reached pressure drop was selected as the membrane performance indicator as reverse osmosis biofouling is in practice predominantly a feed spacer channel problem vrouwenvelder et al 2009 at full scale ro installations operated for long periods up to 10 years with the same membrane modules fed with water containing very low biodegradable nutrient aoc concentrations the cleaning cycle was governed by the feed channel pressure drop increase beyer et al 2014 vrouwenvelder et al 2008 biofouling due to biodegradable nutrients in the feed water affects the membrane performance decline in a temporal sequence first the feed channel pressure drop is increased then at a later moment and to a lesser extend the flux decline followed by increased salt passage siebdrath et al 2019 2 4 2 biomass quantification membrane autopsies at the end of the experiment were carried out by retrieving membrane and feed spacer coupons of 4 4 cm2 from the mfs to quantify and characterize the accumulated fouling sheets of membrane and spacer were analyzed for total organic carbon toc and adenosine triphosphate atp the feed water surface area of the membrane is 4 4 cm2 the total surface area of the feed spacer is depending on the spacer geometry and thickness approximately similar to the surface area of the membrane sheet area facing the feed water the sections of the membranes and spacer 8 cm2 each were placed in a capped tube in 40 ml sterile tap water for atp analysis or ultrapure water for toc analysis to determine the amount of biomass the tubes with the membrane and spacer coupons were placed in an ultrasonic water bath branson 5510mth output

were measured in duplicates to prepare a calibration curve a stock solution of potassium hydrogen phthalate toc standard solution icc 033 5 ultra scientific usa was diluted with ultrapure water to obtain solutions with carbon concentrations between 0 and 10 mg l 1 c the detection limit of the method was about 0 1 mg l 1 c 2 4 3 flow cytometry flow cytometry was used to measure the bacterial total cell counts tcc in the biofilm according to the protocol reported by neu et al 2019 in order to compare the bacterial total cell concentration between biofilms in brief a 4 2 cm2 coupon of biofouled membrane and spacer was placed in a capped tub in 40 ml ultrapure water followed by 2 min of vortexing to separate the biomass from the membrane and spacer samples 500 μl were preheated to 35 c for 10 min stained with 10 μl ml 1 sybr green i molecular probes eugene or usa then incubated in the dark at 35 c for 10 min measurements were performed using a bd accuri c6 flow cytometer bd

count following the procedure described by hammes and egli 2005 2 4 4 extraction and quantification of extracellular polymeric substances eps for eps analysis a 4 4 cm2 coupon of biofouled membrane and spacer was placed into 10 ml phosphate buffered saline solution pbs followed by 2 min of vortexing and 5 min of sonication to separate the biomass from the membranes the eps was extracted following the formaldehyde naoh method established by liu and fang 2002 and quantified by measuring carbohydrates sulfuric acid phenol method and proteins bsa in brief the eps suspended in 10 ml pbs was treated using 0 06 ml formaldehyde 36 5 sigma aldrich mo usa at 4 c for 1 h and incubated with 4 ml 1 n naoh at 4 c for 3 h after treatment the samples were centrifuged for 20 min at 20000 g the

concentrations using bovine serum albumin bsa as a standard were measured using a bca protein assay kit thermo scientific inc nh usa according to the manufacturer s guidelines 2 4 5 biofilm structural properties 2 4 5 1 optical coherence tomography oct oct uses coherent light to capture a scans of optical scattering media such as biofilms consecutive a scans provide a cross sectional view in two dimensions 2d of the biofilm structure b scan b scans are combined to volumetric representations consequently 3d structures are capable to be visualized in seconds in situ imaging of the biofilm in the flow channel was performed using a spectral domain optical coherence tomography thorlabs ganymede oct system with a central light source wavelength of 930 nm the refractive index was 1 33 the oct fitted with a 5 telecentric scan lens thorlabs lsm03bb provided a maximum scan area of 100 mm2 the oct engine is configured to provide high resolution images at a 36 khz a scan rate twenty images were taken at twenty randomized coordinates across the entire membrane fouling simulator b scan x z direction consisting of a length of 5 00 mm and a physical depth of 1 mm with a pixel size in the x direction of 6 00 μm and a z direction of 2 13 μm were taken and used for quantification purposes image processing details with respect to calculated biofilm porosity and area occupied by biofilm in the examined section of the flow channel were quantified using the software developed in matlab mathworks natick us as can be found in previous publications derlon et al 2012 desmond et al 2018 image analysis consisted of i detecting the membrane spacer and biofilm interface with an intensity gradient analysis at the beginning and the end of the experiment ii automatic thresholding of the biofilm for pixels above 20 db this threshold was selected after analyzing more than 200 images studied in twenty independent membrane fouling simulators and then excluding the membrane and spacer taken at time zero iii calculation of the area occupied by biofilm in the cross section of the flow channel and the biofilm porosity 2 4 5 2 area occupied by biofilm in the cross section of the flow channel the membrane and feed spacer area occupied by biofilm in the cross section of the flow channel was calculated based on the pixel area covered by biofilm from each oct image twenty random images were taken at the inlet and outlet location of each mfs 2 4 5 3 biofilm calculated porosity the biofilm porosity is the ratio between the total void area in the biofilm and the biofilm total area blauert et al 2015 in this study we considered biofilm voids as areas with an intensity below 20 db in the two dimensional oct scan the area of the biofilm consisted of the pixels with an intensity higher than 20 db excluding pixels from the membrane and spacer however it has to be emphasized that the resolution of the oct is limited to 6 μm thus only voids larger than the 6 μm are considered therefore the calculated biofilm porosity in this study refers only to the voids of the biofilm structure detected by the oct 6 μm 1 φ b 1 n 1 n a v o i d s a b i o f i l m where φ b is the biofilm calculated porosity a voids and a biofilm m2 are the areas of the voids and the biofilm respectively and n is the number of measurements 3 results 3 1 high assimilable organic carbon concentration 250 μg c l 1 the mfss that were operated under phosphorus restricted p restricted and phosphorus dosed p dosed conditions were stopped once a feed channel pressure drop increase of 150 mbar was reached fig 1 for a high assimilable organic carbon content of 250 μg c l 1 p restricted biofilms caused a faster feed channel pressure drop increase than the p dosed biofilms the toc content was more than two times lower fig 2 a under p restricted conditions compared to when phosphorus was dosed 0 03 mg cm 2 versus 0 07 mg cm 2 respectively the atp concentration fig 2b and total bacterial cell count tcc had the same trend for p restricted and p dosed conditions fig 2c the atp concentration was about 19 times lower under p restricted conditions compared to when phosphorus was dosed 1 45 104 pg cm 2 versus 2 71 105 pg cm 2 respectively the tcc for the p restricted biofilm was only two times lower for the p dosed biofilm 0 59 106 cells cm 2 versus 1 07 106 cells cm 2 respectively the eps content for the p restricted biofilm was higher than that for the p dosed biofilm 56 10 3 mg cm 2 versus 51 10 3 mg cm 2 respectively fig 2d in summary p restricted conditions limited bacterial growth lower values of atp toc tcc but produced more eps compared to p dosed conditions causing a faster increase in the feed channel pressure drop based on two dimensional oct images the area occupied by biofilm and the porosity of the biofilm in the examined section of the flow channel are calculated compared to p dosed biofilms p restricted biofilm had three times more area occupied by biofilm 5 2 10 2 mm2 versus 1 7 10 2 mm2 respectively fig 3 a p restricted biofilms were three times more porous compared to p dosed biofilms 0 65 compared to 0 18 respectively fig 3b fig 3c shows the two dimensional oct images compared to the p restricted biofilm the p dosed biofilm occupied a smaller surface area in the flow channel with high intensity pixels surrounding the spacer a smaller coverage area with higher concentrations of toc atp and tcc can signal to the formation of a denser more compact biofilm the p restricted biofilm occupied a larger area in the flow channel with lower concentrations of toc atp and tcc the intensity profile around the spacer showed areas of lower intensity with much bigger areas with very low intensity considered as voids the higher calculated porosity of the formed biofilm correlates with the lower biomass amount lower values of atp toc and tcc p restricted biofilm disrupted more the cross flow in the feed channel and therefore caused the faster increase of the feed channel pressure drop compared to biofilms grown under p dosed conditions 3 2 low assimilable organic carbon concentration 30 μg c l 1 the second set of experiments was performed to analyze the effect of limiting the assimilable organic carbon to 30 μg c l 1 at phosphorus concentration of 3 μg p l 1 and 0 3 μg p l 1 in the feed water contrary to the 250 μg c l 1 experiment the p restricted biofilm caused a slower feed channel pressure drop increase than the p dosed biofilm fig 4 the p restricted biofilm had a lower toc concentration compared to the p dosed biofilm 0 01 versus 0 02 mg cm 2 respectively fig 5 a the atp concentration was lower under p restricted conditions compared to when phosphorus was dosed 3 30 103 pg cm 2 versus 7 30 103 pg cm 2 respectively fig 5b once again the p restricted biofilm had a higher eps content than the p dosed biofilm 20 00 10 3 mg cm 2 versus 12 00 10 3 mg cm 2 respectively fig 5c therefore results in toc atp and the eps for the biofilm grown under 30 μg c l 1 showed the same trends as for the biofilm grown under 250 μg c l 1 fig 6 ashows the area occupied by the biofilm in the flow channel the p restricted and p dosed biofilms occupied almost the same area in the flow channel at the end of the experiment the p restricted biofilm was significantly p 0 05 more porous in agreement with the biofilm grown under 250 μg c l 1 the biofilm calculated porosity for p restricted and p dosed conditions was 0 53 versus 0 27 respectively fig 6b two dimensional oct images showed a higher intensity for biofilms grown under p dosed conditions compared to the p restricted biofilm which shows areas of lower intensity around the spacer with higher calculated biofilm porosity fig 6c table 2 summarizes the results of all experiments the opposite trend of the feed channel pressure drop increase for biofilms grown under 250 μg c l 1 and 30 μg c l 1 while restricting the phosphorus content can be explained by two factors the first factor is the difference at which the active biomass is producing eps per day for the biofilm grown at 250 μg c l 1 p restricted biofilm produced 70 more eps per day compared to the p dosed biofilm whereas the p restricted biofilm grown at 30 μg c l 1 produced only 25 more eps per day than the p dosed biofilm the second factor is related to the difference in biofilm spatial distribution in the flow channel under different assimilable organic carbon concentrations when phosphorus was restricted but sufficient amount of carbon was available 250 μg c l 1 the biofilm that developed occupied a higher surface area in the flow channel per day 300 compared to the p dosed biofilm which resulted in an accelerated increase in the feed channel pressure drop on the contrary for a lower assimilable organic carbon content 30 μg c l 1 the p restricted biofilm covered 33 less surface area per day in the flow channel compared to the p dosed biofilm resulting in a slower increase in the feed channel pressure drop 4 discussion 4 1 phosphorus limitation restricts microbial growth but increases eps secretion in abundance of assimilable organic carbon previous studies on phosphorus limiting conditions demonstrated an excessive production of extracellular polymeric substances desmond et al 2018 but lower bacterial growth characterized by the active biomass atp and total bacterial cell count tcc kim et al 2014 vrouwenvelder et al 2010 kim et al 2014 demonstrated that the total bacterial cell count was reduced when decreasing the phosphorus concentration in the feed water of a forward osmosis membrane system the objective of this study was to compare the effect of restricting phosphorus in the feed water at two assimilable organic carbon concentrations 250 and 30 μg c l 1 on membrane performance and biomass activity in a reverse osmosis membrane system in agreement with previous studies p restricted conditions limited bacterial growth lower values of atp and tcc but increased eps secretion compared to p dosed conditions at both carbon concentrations this eps production under p restricted conditions affected the biofilm structural properties and thus the system performance feed channel pressure drop increase differently depending on the assimilable organic carbon concentration fig 7 the observed faster pressure drop increase for p restricted conditions when dosing 250 μg c l 1 was a result of the larger area occupied by a more porous biofilm in the flow channel fig 3 this study used tapwater as feedwater but it is expected that the observations obtained in this study for tap water can be applied to swro the yield of bacterial growth is the same for fresh tap and seawater with the same biodegradable nutrient content farhat et al 2018 bacterial cells in a biofilm typically make up a very small fraction less than a half percent of the overall biofilm volume and therefore do not hamper the water flow through the biofilm significantly dreszer et al 2013 the hydraulic biofilm resistance is mainly attributed to the amount and density of extracellular polymeric substances eps and not to the bacterial cells dreszer et al 2013 the importance of eps and its composition on membrane performance decline and cleanability has been demonstrated flemming and wingender 2010 flemming 2020 jafari et al 2020 therefore it is vital to note that when the bacteria are different in seawater the eps produced by these bacteria could be different future biofilm studies comparing biofouling development in membrane systems fed with fresh and with seawater will include the assessment of the bacterial community composition and the eps structure and composition of the biofilm and the feed water 4 2 nutrient limitation influences biofilm morphology and spatial distribution analytical quantification of atp toc tcc and eps give an estimate of the biomass concentration on the membrane and the spacer however these parameters do not show the spatial distribution of the biofilm in the mfs and the biofilm structure feed channel pressure drop measurements are based on the resistance that water experiences when passing through the flow channel bucs et al 2016 drescher et al 2013 this study showed that under high assimilable organic carbon concentration even less biomass atp tcc and toc can have a higher impact on the feed channel pressure drop fig 1 therefore besides the amount of biomass biofilm structural properties such as porosity and the location in the flow channel play an essential role on the effect of membrane performance parameters fortunato et al 2017 in this study the greater influence of the p restricted biofilm on the feed channel pressure drop when dosing 250 μg c l 1 compared with the 30 μg c l 1 can be explained by the biofilm metabolic and structural responses to nutrient restriction oct images showed that for a high assimilable organic carbon concentration three times more area was occupied by the biofilm in the flow channel under restricted phosphorus conditions compared to p dosed condition fig 3a studies on nutrient limiting conditions demonstrate changes in bacterial physiology triggering cell elongation filamentous growth which resulted in the formation of a dispersed biofilm floc ericsson and eriksson 1988 romano et al 2015 seviour et al 2019 the uniform distribution of biofilm over the whole flow cell under limitation conditions and its effect on performance should not be neglected the change in bacterial physiology combined with the higher eps production resulted in a more porous biofilm covering a larger area in the flow channel restricting the water flow in the case of a low assimilable organic carbon content and p dosed conditions bacteria at the beginning of the experiment did not have any nutrient limitation note that clusters of dense biofilm accumulate close to the spacer fig 6c similar of how the biofilm developed under high assimilable organic content and p dosed conditions as the biofilm continues to develop carbon limitation occurs biofilm then starts to spread to maximize nutrient intake linked to the higher rate of pressure drop increase under this condition for the biofilm grown at low assimilable organic carbon content and p restricted conditions the developed biofilm structure signified the occurrence of dual nutrient limitation definitely with one substrate being the limiting substrate at one period in time starting with p limitation followed by c limitation p restricted biofilm started to spread to maximize nutrient intake however the eps production per day is not as fast as in the presence of abundant assimilable organic carbon content 25 versus 70 respectively the covered area by the p restricted biofilm in the flow channel is 33 lower compared to the p dosed conditions which explains the slower pressure drop increase table 2 an important fact to note is that according to this study phosphorus restriction combined with carbon restriction delayed biofilm formation extending system performance by 43 compared to biofilms grown under p dosed conditions moreover additional experiments run in duplicates under different operating conditions e g different cross flow velocity and ended at different values of pressure drop increase data not included in this paper supported the conclusions of this study results from this study highlight that the conventional biomass quantification parameters atp toc tcc and eps did not correlate with the pressure drop increase and cannot aid in predicting the system performance decline the two parameters combined together that correlated the most with the pressure drop increase where the i area occupied by the biofilm in the flow channel and ii biofilm spatial distribution spacer membrane 4 3 carbon concentration determines the effectiveness of phosphorus limitation as a biofouling control strategy restricting the phosphorous concentration resulted in a varying impact on feed channel pressure drop depending on the concentration of assimilable organic carbon that was dosed fig 7 limiting only the phosphorous content while dosing a relatively higher carbon concentration produced a biofilm that lead to a faster pressure drop a strategy based on nutrient limitation should focus on the appropriate selection of the nutrient ratio in the feed water the amount of nutrient converted by bacterial cells to eps depends on the composition of the growth medium a growth medium containing a high ratio of carbon with a limited phosphate enhanced polysaccharide production as shown in miqueleto et al 2010 in this study for the high carbon concentration 250 μg c l 1 even at a deficient phosphorus concentration in the feed water 0 3 μg p l 1 the c p ratio was 833 1 while for the low carbon concentration 30 μg c l 1 the c p ratio was 100 1 when the c p ratio is high the bacteria utilize the excess carbon for eps production rather than cell growth since there is insufficient phosphorus for atp synthesis miqueleto et al 2010 particular attention should be given to the carbon concentration in feedwater because limiting phosphorus without knowing the amount of carbon concentration may result in a negative impact in the feed channel pressure drop increase compared to a non limiting phosphorus condition depending on the available carbon concentration phosphate limitation can be a strategy to prevent biofouling requiring the elimination of phosphate phosphorous based anticalant dosage in pretreatment sweity et al 2013 the presence of both very low concentrations of phosphate and biodegradable substrate in the feed water of a full scale ro installation lead to low biofilm concentrations in the lead and outlet modules of the installation compared to most installations studied vrouwenvelder et al 2008 indicating that combined restriction of phosphate and biodegradable nutrients limited the decline in membrane performance indicators slightly higher biofilm accumulation in the membrane module at the outlet side of the ro installation was observed under these low nutrient conditions vrouwenvelder et al 2010 2008 radu et al 2012 clearly illustrated in numeral simulations how the membrane rejected biodegradable substrates accumulates at the membrane surface due to concentration polarization with an increased biofilm thickness however the overall substrate consumption rate dominates the substrate accumulation due to polarization therefore the accumulation of rejected biodegradable substrate could only accelerate in a limited extent the biofilm growth radu et al 2012 further studies are recommended on concentration polarization of phosphate salt and biodegradable nutrients in relation to biofouling and scaling the difficulty of restricting phosphorous makes carbon limitation a more attractive and cost effective approach for biofouling control in seawater as shown in this study even a minute amount of phosphorus in the feed water at low carbon concentration although delayed biofouling it did not completely eliminate its occurrence on the contrary regardless of the phosphorus concentration a low assimilable organic carbon content delayed the membrane performance decline pressure drop increase significantly compared to high carbon content 4 4 future research quantification of very low phosphorus concentrations in water remains a challenge the principal obstacles are i the limited available techniques to remove phosphorus kumar et al 2019 sevcenco et al 2015 shang et al 2014b 2014a and ii the absence of available detection methods to allow reliable quantification of very low concentrations 0 3 μg p l 1 to validate the efficiency of the removal techniques results from this study emphasize the need for a reliable quantification method for determining phosphorus at concentrations lower than 0 3 μg p l 1 ultra trace phosphorus quantification techniques are needed to show at which p concentration phosphorus limitation occurs causing no biofilm development in order to better understand phosphorus restriction and its effect on membrane performance further studies should focus on i analyzing the effect of permeation and concentration polarization under nutrient limitation conditions ii analyzing the microbial community composition in the biofilm to determine bacterial community that can grow under phosphorus stressed conditions iii understanding the carbon metabolic pathway for eps production versus bacterial cell growth when phosphorus is restricted and iv tuning the phosphorus concentration in the feed water to define the optimal effect on membrane performance and cleanability a future study to separately sample the accumulated material on the feed spacer and membrane and subsequently analyze the composition toc cells atp eps and microbial community is essential as well such study aids in determining whether e g hydraulics and permeate production affect the amount and composition of these biomass parameters and this research could include varying cross flow velocities and permeate fluxes 5 conclusions the objective of this study was to analyze the effect of nutrient limitation on biofilm development and its impact on system performance in this study we assessed the physical structure and chemical composition of the biofilms that developed under phosphorus restricted conditions 0 3 μg p l 1 feed channel pressure drop was determined to understand the impact of the developed biofilm on system performance the developed biofilm was analyzed once the feed channel pressure drop reached an increase of 150 mbar the conclusions of this study can be summarized by i under p restricted conditions for both supplemented assimilable organic carbon concentrations 250 and 30 μg c l 1 the biofilm that developed had less atp tcc and toc but had higher eps production was more porous and occupied a larger area in the flow channel ii a supplemented carbon concentration of 250 μg c l 1 and low feed water p concentration 0 3 μg p l 1 caused an accelerated feed channel pressure drop increase explained by more eps production and a larger area occupied by the biofilm in the cross section of the flow channel compared with biofilms that developed at a carbon concentration of 30 μg c l 1 iii the carbon concentration determines the effectiveness of phosphorus limitation and therefore the impact on the feed channel pressure drop iv limiting both carbon and phosphorus concentrations in the feed water proves to be a suitable

17736,nutrient limitation is a biofouling control strategy in reverse osmosis ro membrane systems in seawater the assimilable organic carbon content available for bacterial growth ranges from about 50 to 400 μg c l 1 while the phosphorus concentration ranges from 3 to 11 μg p l 1 several studies monitored biofouling development limiting either carbon or phosphorus the effect of carbon to phosphorus ratio and the restriction of both nutrients on membrane system performance have not yet been investigated this study examines the impact of reduced phosphorus concentration from 25 μg p l 1 and 3 μg p l 1 to a low concentration of 0 3 μg p l 1 combined with two different carbon concentrations 250 c l 1 and 30 μg c l 1 on biofilm development in an ro system feed channel pressure drop was measured to determine the effect of the developed biofilm on system performance the morphology of the accumulated biomass for both carbon concentrations was characterized by optical coherence tomography oct and the biomass amount and composition was quantified by measuring total organic carbon toc adenosine triphosphate atp total cell counts tcc and extracellular polymeric substances eps concentration for the developed biofilms under phosphorus restricted p restricted and dosed p dosed conditions for both carbon concentrations p restricted conditions 0 3 μg p l 1 limited bacterial growth lower values of atp tcc a faster pressure drop increase was observed for p restricted conditions compared to p dosed conditions when 250 μg c l 1 was dosed this faster pressure drop increase can be explained by a higher area covered by biofilm in the flow channel and a higher amount of produced eps conversely a slower pressure drop increase was observed for p restricted conditions compared to p dosed conditions when 30 μg c l 1 was dosed results of this study demonstrate that p limitation delayed biofilm formation effectively when combined with low assimilable organic carbon concentration and

been carried out to prevent and control biofouling flemming 2020 matin et al 2011 the most commonly applied biofouling control strategy is feedwater pre treatment to reduce organic nutrient content and to remove bacterial cells however even after removal of 99 9 of the microorganisms in the feed water active microbial cells remain which grow and multiply consuming biodegradable substances present in the feed water of the membrane installation flemming 1997 other biofouling control strategies are i membrane surface modification which may delay biofilm formation but does not prevent biofouling ii feed spacer design which reduces the effect of accumulated biomass and enhances the cleanability of the membrane module and iii chemical mechanical membrane cleaning which is effective in temporarily restoring membrane performance bucs et al 2018 sanawar et al 2018 nutrient limitation is considered a biofouling control strategy in reverse osmosis membrane systems with assimilable carbon limitation as the first considered mitigation strategy allan et al 2002 chandy and angles 2001 in seawater the assimilable organic carbon content available for bacterial growth ranges from 50 to 400 μg c l 1 abushaban et al 2019 limitation of nitrogen and phosphorus in the feed water has also been considered to restrict microbial growth in membrane modules desmond et al 2018 jacobson et al 2009 kim et al 2014 vrouwenvelder et al 2010 the phosphorus concentration in seawater ranges from 3 to 11 μg p l 1 and after water pre treatment with processes such as coagulation it may be restricted to values below 1 μg p l 1 jacobson et al 2009 several studies reported a mass ratio for carbon c nitrogen n and phosphorus p of at least 100 23 4 3 for bacterial growth to occur burton et al 2010 indicating that even a minor change in phosphorus concentration in the feed water can have a significant influence on the growth of microorganisms miettinen and vartiainen 1997 phosphorus occurs naturally as different types of phosphate po4 3 i ortho phosphates ii condensed and iii organic phosphates the soluble form ortho phosphate can be readily used by microorganisms vrouwenvelder et al 2010 the condensed form meta pyro and pylo phosphate sometimes referred to as inorganic phosphate is composed of multiple ortho phosphate molecules together cade menun et al 2018 lastly organic phosphates are a class of phosphates which are bound to organic compounds dabkowski and white 2015 although the condensed and organic phosphates are less available for microbial utilization they can be converted to ortho phosphate increasing the concentration of biologically available phosphorus in water lehtola et al 2001 it is not well understood how varying the nutrient composition in the feed water affects the biofilm structure and subsequently the membrane performance indicators in reverse osmosis ro and nanofiltration nf modules biofilm structure has been studied since the early 1990s using microscopic techniques at a microscale some of the principal drawbacks of applying the commonly used microscopic techniques to study membrane biofouling are that these techniques are mainly destructive with a low axial resolution and with limitations in laser penetration neu et al 2010 however in recent years more focus has been directed towards understanding and analyzing biofilm structures at mesoscale optical coherence tomography oct is a non disruptive imaging technique that recently gained attention in biofilm research blauert et al 2015 oct is capable of imaging in situ spatially resolved structures on a millimeter scale with a micrometer resolution therefore oct is used to compare the structural properties of biofilms such as density porosity thickness roughness spatial distribution grown at different nutritional conditions studies have shown that varying the nutrient concentration in the feed water influences the structural properties of biofilms affecting membrane performance parameters derlon et al 2012 desmond et al 2018 several studies have been carried out to characterize biofouling development while limiting either carbon or phosphorus concentration in the feed water allan et al 2002 desmond et al 2018 however the effect of restricting both carbon and phosphorous on biofilm development and its impact on the membrane system has not yet been investigated the objective of this study was to examine the impact of reducing the phosphorus concentration to a low concentration 0 3 μg p l 1 on biofilm development in ro systems at two dosed assimilable organic carbon concentrations 250 and 30 μg c l 1 morphology and composition of the developed biofilms were examined under phosphorus restricted p restricted 0 3 μg p l 1 and dosed p dosed 3 and 25 μg p l 1 conditions the effect of varying the nutrient load on membrane system performance feed channel pressure drop was monitored to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the biofouling problem and therefore its control 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup a lab scale experimental setup representative to the practical operation of spiral wound membrane systems was used for this study bucs et al 2016 a cross flow channel comprising of a membrane sheet and feed flow channel called membrane fouling simulator mfs was used for this experiment vrouwenvelder et al 2007 the setup consisted of a feed water pump a feed flow meter and controller a biodegradable nutrient dosage system pump and controller a membrane fouling simulator a back pressure valve bronkhorst ruurlo netherlands and a differential pressure sensor delta bar pmd75 endress hauser switzerland to monitor the pressure drop over the flow channel the system was fed by potable tap water produced by the king abdullah university of science and technology seawater desalination plant thuwal jeddah saudi arabia because the tap water is chlorinated the feed water was filtered by an activated carbon filter filter housing model ups bb3 awf ups 3h 20b cartridges model sediment carbon ac sc 10 nl to remove the residual chlorine and by two cartridge filters pore size 4 μm to remove any particles entering the feed water from the carbon filter for this study reverse osmosis produced tap water was selected to ensure an extremely low phosphorus content earlier work farhat et al 2018 has shown that dosage of biodegradable nutrients to various water types provided the same bacterial growth yield in seawater as the bacterial growth yield in tap water therefore the results presented in this paper are representative for seawater biofouling as well the original mfs has been modified to include an optical glass sight window to allow in situ oct imaging the mfs uses a membrane with the dimensions of 20 cm 3 5 cm a 34 mil 864 μm thick feed channel spacer taken from a new commercially available spiral wound membrane element tw30 4040 dow filmtec usa the mfs has an inlet and outlet sides allowing cross flow operation and two orifices for different pressure measurements the system and water characteristics are representative of biofilm studies as previously reported by farhat et al 2019 2 2 operating conditions the system was operated at a constant pressure of two bar in cross flow mode the feed water was pumped through the mfs at a flow rate of 17 l h 1 equivalents to a linear flow velocity of 0 18 m s 1 which is representative for practical membrane filtration installations bucs et al 2016 the tap water feeding the mfs had a phosphorus concentration of 0 3 μg p l 1 table 1 shows the experimental conditions a nutrient stock solution containing sodium acetate sodium nitrate and sodium phosphate in a mass ratio of c n p of 100 20 10 and 100 20 0 was prepared for p dosed and p restricted conditions respectively the nutrient stock solution was added to the feed water to enhance biofilm growth in the flow cell increasing the assimilable organic carbon concentration of the feed water by 250 μg c l 1 and 30 μg c l 1 chemicals from sigma aldrich darmstadt germany were purchased in analytical grade the ph value was set at 11 by the addition of sodium hydroxide to restrict bacterial growth in the nutrient stock solution the feed water flow rate was high 17 0 l h 1 compared to the dosing flow rate of the nutrient solution 0 03 l h 1 consequently the high ph value of the nutrient solution did not affect the feed water ph of 7 8 farhat et al 2019 two fully independent membrane fouling simulators n 2 were run for each set of experiments and the figures show the average and standard deviation 2 3 phosphorus concentration in the feed water to quantify low concentrations of ortho phosphate a low detection auto analyzer using a colorimetric based method was applied seal autoanalyser 3 hr seal analytical germany following the proposed protocol by murphy and riley 1962 the phosphorus concentration reported in this study was calculated from the obtained ortho phosphate concentration triplicate feed water samples were processed for the p restricted water the phosphorus concentration was below the detection limit using the colorimetric auto analyzer method 0 3 μg p l 1 for the p dosed water the measured phosphorus concentrations 26 0 and 3 5 μg p l 1 were in good agreement with the dosed phosphorus concentrations 25 0 μg p l 1 and 3 0 μg p l 1 respectively 2 4 fouling monitoring 2 4 1 system performance parameters feed channel pressure drop two sets of experiments one for each carbon concentration consisting of four membrane fouling simulators were run in parallel fouling development was monitored by measuring the feed channel pressure drop over the length of the flow cell the average initial pressure drop registered in each mfs was 27 4 mbar for both carbon concentrations experiments stopped once a feed channel pressure drop increase of 150 mbar reached pressure drop was selected as the membrane performance indicator as reverse osmosis biofouling is in practice predominantly a feed spacer channel problem vrouwenvelder et al 2009 at full scale ro installations operated for long periods up to 10 years with the same membrane modules fed with water containing very low biodegradable nutrient aoc concentrations the cleaning cycle was governed by the feed channel pressure drop increase beyer et al 2014 vrouwenvelder et al 2008 biofouling due to biodegradable nutrients in the feed water affects the membrane performance decline in a temporal sequence first the feed channel pressure drop is increased then at a later moment and to a lesser extend the flux decline followed by increased salt passage siebdrath et al 2019 2 4 2 biomass quantification membrane autopsies at the end of the experiment were carried out by retrieving membrane and feed spacer coupons of 4 4 cm2 from the mfs to quantify and characterize the accumulated fouling sheets of membrane and spacer were analyzed for total organic carbon toc and adenosine triphosphate atp the feed water surface area of the membrane is 4 4 cm2 the total surface area of the feed spacer is depending on the spacer geometry and thickness approximately similar to the surface area of the membrane sheet area facing the feed water the sections of the membranes and spacer 8 cm2 each were placed in a capped tube in 40 ml sterile tap water for atp analysis or ultrapure water for toc analysis to determine the amount of biomass the tubes with the membrane and spacer coupons were placed in an ultrasonic water bath branson 5510mth output 135 w 40 khz low energy sonic treatment 2 min followed by mixing on a vortex few seconds was repeated two times when the liquid was visually not homogeneous or when all biomass was not removed from

analyzer toc vcph shimadzu japan equipped with a high sensitive catalyst high sense tc catalyst shimadzu japan the toc concentration for each sample was the average of the three measurements samples were measured in duplicates to prepare a calibration curve a stock solution of potassium hydrogen phthalate toc standard solution icc 033 5 ultra scientific usa was diluted with ultrapure water to obtain solutions with carbon concentrations between 0 and 10 mg l 1 c the detection limit of the method was about 0 1 mg l 1 c 2 4 3 flow cytometry flow cytometry was used to measure the bacterial total cell counts tcc in the biofilm according to the protocol reported by neu et al 2019 in order to compare the bacterial total cell concentration between biofilms in brief a 4 2 cm2 coupon of biofouled membrane and spacer was placed in a capped tub in 40 ml ultrapure water followed by 2 min of vortexing to separate the biomass from the membrane and spacer samples 500 μl were preheated to 35 c for 10 min stained with 10 μl ml 1 sybr green i molecular probes eugene or usa then incubated in the dark at 35 c for 10 min measurements were performed using a bd accuri c6 flow cytometer bd accuri cytometers belgium equipped with a 50 mw laser having a fixed emission wavelength of 488 nm fluorescence intensity was collected at fl1 533 30 nm fl3 670 nm sideward and forward scattered light intensities were obtained as well all data were processed with the bd accuri cflow software and electronic gating was used to select sybr green labeled signals for quantifying total bacterial cell count following the procedure described by hammes and egli 2005 2 4 4 extraction and quantification of extracellular polymeric substances eps for eps analysis a 4 4 cm2 coupon of biofouled membrane and spacer was placed into 10 ml phosphate buffered saline solution pbs followed by 2 min of vortexing and 5 min of sonication to separate the biomass from the membranes the eps was extracted following the formaldehyde naoh method established by liu and fang 2002 and quantified by measuring carbohydrates sulfuric acid phenol method and proteins bsa in brief the eps suspended in 10 ml pbs was treated using 0 06 ml formaldehyde 36 5 sigma aldrich mo usa at 4 c for 1 h and incubated with 4 ml 1 n naoh at 4 c for 3 h after treatment the samples were centrifuged for 20 min at 20000 g the supernatant was filtered through a 0 2 μm pore sized membrane and dialyzed using a 3500 da dialysis membrane thermo fisher scientific usa for 24 h the dialyzed samples were lyophilized for 48 h and re suspended in 10 ml of mq water the carbohydrates were measured following the sulfuric acid phenol method masuko et al 2005 in brief 200 μl of the sample was mixed with 600 μl sulfuric acid and 120 μl

concentrations using bovine serum albumin bsa as a standard were measured using a bca protein assay kit thermo scientific inc nh usa according to the manufacturer s guidelines 2 4 5 biofilm structural properties 2 4 5 1 optical coherence tomography oct oct uses coherent light to capture a scans of optical scattering media such as biofilms consecutive a scans provide a cross sectional view in two dimensions 2d of the biofilm structure b scan b scans are combined to volumetric representations consequently 3d structures are capable to be visualized in seconds in situ imaging of the biofilm in the flow channel was performed using a spectral domain optical coherence tomography thorlabs ganymede oct system with a central light source wavelength of 930 nm the refractive index was 1 33 the oct fitted with a 5 telecentric scan lens thorlabs lsm03bb provided a maximum scan area of 100 mm2 the oct engine is configured to provide high resolution images at a 36 khz a scan rate twenty images were taken at twenty randomized coordinates across the entire membrane fouling simulator b scan x z direction consisting of a length of 5 00 mm and a physical depth of 1 mm with a pixel size in the x direction of 6 00 μm and a z direction of 2 13 μm were taken and used for quantification purposes image processing details with respect to calculated biofilm porosity and area occupied by biofilm in the examined section of the flow channel were quantified using the software developed in matlab mathworks natick us as can be found in previous publications derlon et al 2012 desmond et al 2018 image analysis consisted of i detecting the membrane spacer and biofilm interface with an intensity gradient analysis at the beginning and the end of the experiment ii automatic thresholding of the biofilm for pixels above 20 db this threshold was selected after analyzing more than 200 images studied in twenty independent membrane fouling simulators and then excluding the membrane and spacer taken at time zero iii calculation of the area occupied by biofilm in the cross section of the flow channel and the biofilm porosity 2 4 5 2 area occupied by biofilm in the cross section of the flow channel the membrane and feed spacer area occupied by biofilm in the cross section of the flow channel was calculated based on the pixel area covered by biofilm from each oct image twenty random images were taken at the inlet and outlet location of each mfs 2 4 5 3 biofilm calculated porosity the biofilm porosity is the ratio between the total void area in the biofilm and the biofilm total area blauert et al 2015 in this study we considered biofilm voids as areas with an intensity below 20 db in the two dimensional oct scan the area of the biofilm consisted of the pixels with an intensity higher than 20 db excluding pixels from the membrane and spacer however it has to be emphasized that the resolution of the oct is limited to 6 μm thus only voids larger than the 6 μm are considered therefore the calculated biofilm porosity in this study refers only to the voids of the biofilm structure detected by the oct 6 μm 1 φ b 1 n 1 n a v o i d s a b i o f i l m where φ b is the biofilm calculated porosity a voids and a biofilm m2 are the areas of the voids and the biofilm respectively and n is the number of measurements 3 results 3 1 high assimilable organic carbon concentration 250 μg c l 1 the mfss that were operated under phosphorus restricted p restricted and phosphorus dosed p dosed conditions were stopped once a feed channel pressure drop increase of 150 mbar was reached fig 1 for a high assimilable organic carbon content of 250 μg c l 1 p restricted biofilms caused a faster feed channel pressure drop increase than the p dosed biofilms the toc content was more than two times lower fig 2 a under p restricted conditions compared to when phosphorus was dosed 0 03 mg cm 2 versus 0 07 mg cm 2 respectively the atp concentration fig 2b and total bacterial cell count tcc had the same trend for p restricted and p dosed conditions fig 2c the atp concentration was about 19 times lower under p restricted conditions compared to when phosphorus was dosed 1 45 104 pg cm 2 versus 2 71 105 pg cm 2 respectively the tcc for the p restricted biofilm was only two times lower for the p dosed biofilm 0 59 106 cells cm 2 versus 1 07 106 cells cm 2 respectively the eps content for the p restricted biofilm was higher than that for the p dosed biofilm 56 10 3 mg cm 2 versus 51 10 3 mg cm 2 respectively fig 2d in summary p restricted conditions limited bacterial growth lower values of atp toc tcc but produced more eps compared to p dosed conditions causing a faster increase in the feed channel pressure drop based on two dimensional oct images the area occupied by biofilm and the porosity of the biofilm in the examined section of the flow channel are calculated compared to p dosed biofilms p restricted biofilm had three times more area occupied by biofilm 5 2 10 2 mm2 versus 1 7 10 2 mm2 respectively fig 3 a p restricted biofilms were three times more porous compared to p dosed biofilms 0 65 compared to 0 18 respectively fig 3b fig 3c shows the two dimensional oct images compared to the p restricted biofilm the p dosed biofilm occupied a smaller surface area in the flow channel with high intensity pixels surrounding the spacer a smaller coverage area with higher concentrations of toc atp and tcc can signal to the formation of a denser more compact biofilm the p restricted biofilm occupied a larger area in the flow channel with lower concentrations of toc atp and tcc the intensity profile around the spacer showed areas of lower intensity with much bigger areas with very low intensity considered as voids the higher calculated porosity of the formed biofilm correlates with the lower biomass amount lower values of atp toc and tcc p restricted biofilm disrupted more the cross flow in the feed channel and therefore caused the faster increase of the feed channel pressure drop compared to biofilms grown under p dosed conditions 3 2 low assimilable organic carbon concentration 30 μg c l 1 the second set of experiments was performed to analyze the effect of limiting the assimilable organic carbon to 30 μg c l 1 at phosphorus concentration of 3 μg p l 1 and 0 3 μg p l 1 in the feed water contrary to the 250 μg c l 1 experiment the p restricted biofilm caused a slower feed channel pressure drop increase than the p dosed biofilm fig 4 the p restricted biofilm had a lower toc concentration compared to the p dosed biofilm 0 01 versus 0 02 mg cm 2 respectively fig 5 a the atp concentration was lower under p restricted conditions compared to when phosphorus was dosed 3 30 103 pg cm 2 versus 7 30 103 pg cm 2 respectively fig 5b once again the p restricted biofilm had a higher eps content than the p dosed biofilm 20 00 10 3 mg cm 2 versus 12 00 10 3 mg cm 2 respectively fig 5c therefore results in toc atp and the eps for the biofilm grown under 30 μg c l 1 showed the same trends as for the biofilm grown under 250 μg c l 1 fig 6 ashows the area occupied by the biofilm in the flow channel the p restricted and p dosed biofilms occupied almost the same area in the flow channel at the end of the experiment the p restricted biofilm was significantly p 0 05 more porous in agreement with the biofilm grown under 250 μg c l 1 the biofilm calculated porosity for p restricted and p dosed conditions was 0 53 versus 0 27 respectively fig 6b two dimensional oct images showed a higher intensity for biofilms grown under p dosed conditions compared to the p restricted biofilm which shows areas of lower intensity around the spacer with higher calculated biofilm porosity fig 6c table 2 summarizes the results of all experiments the opposite trend of the feed channel pressure drop increase for biofilms grown under 250 μg c l 1 and 30 μg c l 1 while restricting the phosphorus content can be explained by two factors the first factor is the difference at which the active biomass is producing eps per day for the biofilm grown at 250 μg c l 1 p restricted biofilm produced 70 more eps per day compared to the p dosed biofilm whereas the p restricted biofilm grown at 30 μg c l 1 produced only 25 more eps per day than the p dosed biofilm the second factor is related to the difference in biofilm spatial distribution in the flow channel under different assimilable organic carbon concentrations when phosphorus was restricted but sufficient amount of carbon was available 250 μg c l 1 the biofilm that developed occupied a higher surface area in the flow channel per day 300 compared to the p dosed biofilm which resulted in an accelerated increase in the feed channel pressure drop on the contrary for a lower assimilable organic carbon content 30 μg c l 1 the p restricted biofilm covered 33 less surface area per day in the flow channel compared to the p dosed biofilm resulting in a slower increase in the feed channel pressure drop 4 discussion 4 1 phosphorus limitation restricts microbial growth but increases eps secretion in abundance of assimilable organic carbon previous studies on phosphorus limiting conditions demonstrated an excessive production of extracellular polymeric substances desmond et al 2018 but lower bacterial growth characterized by the active biomass atp and total bacterial cell count tcc kim et al 2014 vrouwenvelder et al 2010 kim et al 2014 demonstrated that the total bacterial cell count was reduced when decreasing the phosphorus concentration in the feed water of a forward osmosis membrane system the objective of this study was to compare the effect of restricting phosphorus in the feed water at two assimilable organic carbon concentrations 250 and 30 μg c l 1 on membrane performance and biomass activity in a reverse osmosis membrane system in agreement with previous studies p restricted conditions limited bacterial growth lower values of atp and tcc but increased eps secretion compared to p dosed conditions at both carbon concentrations this eps production under p restricted conditions affected the biofilm structural properties and thus the system performance feed channel pressure drop increase differently depending on the assimilable organic carbon concentration fig 7 the observed faster pressure drop increase for p restricted conditions when dosing 250 μg c l 1 was a result of the larger area occupied by a more porous biofilm in the flow channel fig 3 this study used tapwater as feedwater but it is expected that the observations obtained in this study for tap water can be applied to swro the yield of bacterial growth is the same for fresh tap and seawater with the same biodegradable nutrient content farhat et al 2018 bacterial cells in a biofilm typically make up a very small fraction less than a half percent of the overall biofilm volume and therefore do not hamper the water flow through the biofilm significantly dreszer et al 2013 the hydraulic biofilm resistance is mainly attributed to the amount and density of extracellular polymeric substances eps and not to the bacterial cells dreszer et al 2013 the importance of eps and its composition on membrane performance decline and cleanability has been demonstrated flemming and wingender 2010 flemming 2020 jafari et al 2020 therefore it is vital to note that when the bacteria are different in seawater the eps produced by these bacteria could be different future biofilm studies comparing biofouling development in membrane systems fed with fresh and with seawater will include the assessment of the bacterial community composition and the eps structure and composition of the biofilm and the feed water 4 2 nutrient limitation influences biofilm morphology and spatial distribution analytical quantification of atp toc tcc and eps give an estimate of the biomass concentration on the membrane and the spacer however these parameters do not show the spatial distribution of the biofilm in the mfs and the biofilm structure feed channel pressure drop measurements are based on the resistance that water experiences when passing through the flow channel bucs et al 2016 drescher et al 2013 this study showed that under high assimilable organic carbon concentration even less biomass atp tcc and toc can have a higher impact on the feed channel pressure drop fig 1 therefore besides the amount of biomass biofilm structural properties such as porosity and the location in the flow channel play an essential role on the effect of membrane performance parameters fortunato et al 2017 in this study the greater influence of the p restricted biofilm on the feed channel pressure drop when dosing 250 μg c l 1 compared with the 30 μg c l 1 can be explained by the biofilm metabolic and structural responses to nutrient restriction oct images showed that for a high assimilable organic carbon concentration three times more area was occupied by the biofilm in the flow channel under restricted phosphorus conditions compared to p dosed condition fig 3a studies on nutrient limiting conditions demonstrate changes in bacterial physiology triggering cell elongation filamentous growth which resulted in the formation of a dispersed biofilm floc ericsson and eriksson 1988 romano et al 2015 seviour et al 2019 the uniform distribution of biofilm over the whole flow cell under limitation conditions and its effect on performance should not be neglected the change in bacterial physiology combined with the higher eps production resulted in a more porous biofilm covering a larger area in the flow channel restricting the water flow in the case of a low assimilable organic carbon content and p dosed conditions bacteria at the beginning of the experiment did not have any nutrient limitation note that clusters of dense biofilm accumulate close to the spacer fig 6c similar of how the biofilm developed under high assimilable organic content and p dosed conditions as the biofilm continues to develop carbon limitation occurs biofilm then starts to spread to maximize nutrient intake linked to the higher rate of pressure drop increase under this condition for the biofilm grown at low assimilable organic carbon content and p restricted conditions the developed biofilm structure signified the occurrence of dual nutrient limitation definitely with one substrate being the limiting substrate at one period in time starting with p limitation followed by c limitation p restricted biofilm started to spread to maximize nutrient intake however the eps production per day is not as fast as in the presence of abundant assimilable organic carbon content 25 versus 70 respectively the covered area by the p restricted biofilm in the flow channel is 33 lower compared to the p dosed conditions which explains the slower pressure drop increase table 2 an important fact to note is that according to this study phosphorus restriction combined with carbon restriction delayed biofilm formation extending system performance by 43 compared to biofilms grown under p dosed conditions moreover additional experiments run in duplicates under different operating conditions e g different cross flow velocity and ended at different values of pressure drop increase data not included in this paper supported the conclusions of this study results from this study highlight that the conventional biomass quantification parameters atp toc tcc and eps did not correlate with the pressure drop increase and cannot aid in predicting the system performance decline the two parameters combined together that correlated the most with the pressure drop increase where the i area occupied by the biofilm in the flow channel and ii biofilm spatial distribution spacer membrane 4 3 carbon concentration determines the effectiveness of phosphorus limitation as a biofouling control strategy restricting the phosphorous concentration resulted in a varying impact on feed channel pressure drop depending on the concentration of assimilable organic carbon that was dosed fig 7 limiting only the phosphorous content while dosing a relatively higher carbon concentration produced a biofilm that lead to a faster pressure drop a strategy based on nutrient limitation should focus on the appropriate selection of the nutrient ratio in the feed water the amount of nutrient converted by bacterial cells to eps depends on the composition of the growth medium a growth medium containing a high ratio of carbon with a limited phosphate enhanced polysaccharide production as shown in miqueleto et al 2010 in this study for the high carbon concentration 250 μg c l 1 even at a deficient phosphorus concentration in the feed water 0 3 μg p l 1 the c p ratio was 833 1 while for the low carbon concentration 30 μg c l 1 the c p ratio was 100 1 when the c p ratio is high the bacteria utilize the excess carbon for eps production rather than cell growth since there is insufficient phosphorus for atp synthesis miqueleto et al 2010 particular attention should be given to the carbon concentration in feedwater because limiting phosphorus without knowing the amount of carbon concentration may result in a negative impact in the feed channel pressure drop increase compared to a non limiting phosphorus condition depending on the available carbon concentration phosphate limitation can be a strategy to prevent biofouling requiring the elimination of phosphate phosphorous based anticalant dosage in pretreatment sweity et al 2013 the presence of both very low concentrations of phosphate and biodegradable substrate in the feed water of a full scale ro installation lead to low biofilm concentrations in the lead and outlet modules of the installation compared to most installations studied vrouwenvelder et al 2008 indicating that combined restriction of phosphate and biodegradable nutrients limited the decline in membrane performance indicators slightly higher biofilm accumulation in the membrane module at the outlet side of the ro installation was observed under these low nutrient conditions vrouwenvelder et al 2010 2008 radu et al 2012 clearly illustrated in numeral simulations how the membrane rejected biodegradable substrates accumulates at the membrane surface due to concentration polarization with an increased biofilm thickness however the overall substrate consumption rate dominates the substrate accumulation due to polarization therefore the accumulation of rejected biodegradable substrate could only accelerate in a limited extent the biofilm growth radu et al 2012 further studies are recommended on concentration polarization of phosphate salt and biodegradable nutrients in relation to biofouling and scaling the difficulty of restricting phosphorous makes carbon limitation a more attractive and cost effective approach for biofouling control in seawater as shown in this study even a minute amount of phosphorus in the feed water at low carbon concentration although delayed biofouling it did not completely eliminate its occurrence on the contrary regardless of the phosphorus concentration a low assimilable organic carbon content delayed the membrane performance decline pressure drop increase significantly compared to high carbon content 4 4 future research quantification of very low phosphorus concentrations in water remains a challenge the principal obstacles are i the limited available techniques to remove phosphorus kumar et al 2019 sevcenco et al 2015 shang et al 2014b 2014a and ii the absence of available detection methods to allow reliable quantification of very low concentrations 0 3 μg p l 1 to validate the efficiency of the removal techniques results from this study emphasize the need for a reliable quantification method for determining phosphorus at concentrations lower than 0 3 μg p l 1 ultra trace phosphorus quantification techniques are needed to show at which p concentration phosphorus limitation occurs causing no biofilm development in order to better understand phosphorus restriction and its effect on membrane performance further studies should focus on i analyzing the effect of permeation and concentration polarization under nutrient limitation conditions ii analyzing the microbial community composition in the biofilm to determine bacterial community that can grow under phosphorus stressed conditions iii understanding the carbon metabolic pathway for eps production versus bacterial cell growth when phosphorus is restricted and iv tuning the phosphorus concentration in the feed water to define the optimal effect on membrane performance and cleanability a future study to separately sample the accumulated material on the feed spacer and membrane and subsequently analyze the composition toc cells atp eps and microbial community is essential as well such study aids in determining whether e g hydraulics and permeate production affect the amount and composition of these biomass parameters and this research could include varying cross flow velocities and permeate fluxes 5 conclusions the objective of this study was to analyze the effect of nutrient limitation on biofilm development and its impact on system performance in this study we assessed the physical structure and chemical composition of the biofilms that developed under phosphorus restricted conditions 0 3 μg p l 1 feed channel pressure drop was determined to understand the impact of the developed biofilm on system performance the developed biofilm was analyzed once the feed channel pressure drop reached an increase of 150 mbar the conclusions of this study can be summarized by i under p restricted conditions for both supplemented assimilable organic carbon concentrations 250 and 30 μg c l 1 the biofilm that developed had less atp tcc and toc but had higher eps production was more porous and occupied a larger area in the flow channel ii a supplemented carbon concentration of 250 μg c l 1 and low feed water p concentration 0 3 μg p l 1 caused an accelerated feed channel pressure drop increase explained by more eps production and a larger area occupied by the biofilm in the cross section of the flow channel compared with biofilms that developed at a carbon concentration of 30 μg c l 1 iii the carbon concentration determines the effectiveness of phosphorus limitation and therefore the impact on the feed channel pressure drop iv limiting both carbon and phosphorus concentrations in the feed water proves to be a suitable approach in delaying biofilm formation and hence lengthening the overall membrane system performance declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

17737,proteins are one of the major contributors to membrane fouling the interaction between proteins and the polymer membrane at the molecular level is essential for the alleviation prevention of membrane fouling but remains unclear in this work time dependent in situ attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy is applied to investigate the interaction process between two model proteins bovine serum albumin and lysozyme and the poly vinylidene fluoride pvdf membrane multivariate curve resolution alternating least squares is integrated with two dimensional correlation spectroscopy analysis to resolve the membrane induced conformational changes of proteins the multivariate curve resolution alternating least squares analysis reveals a two step process in the protein membrane interaction and provides the kinetics of the conformational transition which aids the segmentation of the spectral dataset by applying two dimensional correlation spectroscopy analysis to different groups of the time dependent spectra the sequential order of the secondary structural changes of proteins is determined the proteins initially undergo unfolding transition to a more open less structured state which appears to be triggered by the hydrophobic membrane surface afterwards the proteins become aggregated with the high anti parallel β sheet content aggravating the membrane fouling the conformational transition process of proteins was also confirmed by the atomic force microscopic images and quartz crystal microbalance measurement overall this work provides an in depth understanding of the interaction between proteins and the membrane surface which is helpful for the development of membrane anti fouling strategies graphical abstract image 1 keywords protein membrane fouling attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy multivariate curve resolution alternating least squares analysis two dimensional correlation spectroscopic analysis 1 introduction the implementation of membrane technology continues to increase in the field of water and wastewater treatment owing to its unique advantages such as the compact area of occupation high effluent quality and less residue chen et al 2018 yu et al 2019 however membrane fouling results in a significant decrease in membrane permeability selectivity and service lifetime and has become the primary problem for more widespread and large scale applications of membrane technology chen et al 2018 gao et al 2018 proteins are abundant in water and wastewater and are recognized as one of the major contributors to membrane fouling gao et al 2018 for instance proteins take up around 53 of the foulants after a four week operation of the seawater reverse osmosis membrane reactor khan et al 2013 they also play an important role in the irreversible fouling within a membrane bioreactor zhang et al 2017 therefore it is of great significance to investigate the fouling process caused by proteins numerous techniques have been used to explore the interaction mechanism between proteins and membranes and attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared atr ftir spectroscopy is an attractive tool owing to its characteristics such as non invasive surface sensitive and the capability to provide rich chemical information it has been widely used to characterize the membrane materials determine the thickness of the coating layers on the membranes identify the chemical state of water in the fouling process and examine the fouling layers on the membrane surface bass and freger 2015 belfer et al 2000 guo et al 2019 despite the extent and depth of these studies the microscopic mechanisms of protein fouling remain unrevealed on the one hand in these previous studies the ex situ atr ftir spectroscopy was used to monitor membrane fouling but failed to give comprehensive understanding of the entire fouling process since the membranes have to be moved out from the reactor and air dried the fouling layer might be damaged and the properties of the proteins might have been changed therefore an in situ online characterization is needed to monitor the reaction process at the solution membrane interface on the other hand the conformational changes of the proteins should be given attention as the conformational details of proteins are likely to significantly influence the extent and rate of membrane fouling langdon et al 2015 wang et al 2010 wei et al 2009 for instance thermal denaturing of bsa would expose more hydrophobic residues and result in an obvious flux decline compared to the native bsa liu et al 2018 however the potential of atr ftir spectroscopy for ascertaining the nature of proteins on the membranes is still limited owing to the severe spectral superposition to resolve the extensively overlapping spectral features curve fitting methods e g the gaussian lorentzian function and polynomial or linear least square procedures are generally used however the curve fitting results depend heavily on the artificially selected parameters such as the numbers positions shapes and width of the peaks li et al 2006 therefore sufficient prior knowledge about these parameters is required to accomplish the curve fitting analysis more recently multivariate curve resolution alternating least squares mcr als and two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2dcos have been introduced to analyze the atr ftir spectra and investigate the protein involved interactions schmidt and martinez 2016 shashilov and lednev 2010 mcr als allows for the mathematical resolution of concentration and spectral profiles of pure components from the raw dataset without a priori knowledge about the studied system hence it has been proven to be very useful to interpret the reaction processes alcaraz et al 2017 del rio et al 2009 li et al 2006 for instance mcr als has been successfully applied to resolve the intermediates in protein folding and the kinetic concentration profiles from the reaction based chemical sensors alcaraz et al 2017 shashilov and lednev 2010 2dcos which is based on covariance and or correlation analysis of the external perturbation induced variations is able to improve the spectral resolution chen et al 2019 schmidt and martinez 2016 most importantly 2dcos can provide the sequence of the peak intensity changes and the relationship between bands which aids the band assignment chen et al 2019 shashilov and lednev 2009 however the 2dcos methods are only suitable for the monotone changes otherwise the reaction sequence might be misinterpreted shashilov and lednev 2009 therefore segmentation of the spectral dataset into small blocks is required to capture the individual processes and assign the sequential orders of intensity changes without any ambiguity which could be accomplished on the basis of the mcr als results address these challenges we established an online and in situ atr ftir spectroscopic platform to monitor the membrane fouling process caused by proteins in this work an integrated approach of mcr als with 2dcos was developed to resolve the complex time dependent atr ftir spectra mcr als was used to extract the spectra and kinetic curve profiles of pure species of interest involved in the reaction process the kinetic profiles served as an important basis for the segmentation of perturbation ranges with the aid of 2dcos analysis the variation of the secondary structure of proteins and the sequential order of the conformational changes could be obtained in each perturbation range as a consequence a mechanistic insight into the complex protein membrane interaction could be provided which will be helpful for understanding the membrane fouling and developing anti fouling strategies the molecular behaviors of two model proteins bsa and lysozyme lys were examined at the interface of poly vinylidene fluoride pvdf membrane under neutral ph conditions bsa and lys carry negative and positive net charges respectively pvdf is a widely used membrane material and its intrinsic hydrophobicity causes easy adsorption of biomacromolecules and organic matter on the membrane surface leading to membrane fouling hashino et al 2011 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and samples all reagents and chemicals were of analytical grade and used as supplied without further purification pvdf powder sinopharm chemical reagent co china was dissolved in n n dimethylformamide to prepare a 0 5 wt membrane stock solution a 10 mm sodium chloride solution was prepared using ultrapure water and used as the background solution in the atr ftir measurement bsa and lys sangon biotech co china were dissolved respectively in 10 mm sodium chloride solution as the working solution wang and tang 2011 the sodium chloride herein was utilized to stabilize the ionic strength of the working solution the ph value of the working solution was adjusted to 7 0 with sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid since the isoelectric points for bsa and lys are ph 4 7 and 11 4 respectively bsa is negatively charged whereas lys is positively charged at ph 7 0 wang and tang 2011 the key characteristics of bsa and lys such as isoelectric point pi molecular weight structural flexibility and hydrophobicity related parameters are listed in table s1 the protein working solutions were freshly prepared prior to each atr ftir measurement 2 2 membrane characterizations a certain amount of pvdf membrane solution was dropped onto the cover slide and dried overnight at 60 c the contact angle and surface zeta potential were 89 and 47 mv respectively suggesting that the pvdf membrane was relatively hydrophobic and negatively charged fig s1 details of the membrane characterization methods are provided in the supplementary material 2 3 atr ftir measurement the atr ftir experiment was carried out with a vertex 70 ftir spectrometer bruker co germany the sample cell with a horizontal znse crystal 50 10 3 mm3 incident angle of 45 was amounted onto an atr accessory and exposed to the optical path of the spectrometer with an external nitrogen cooled mct detector fig 1 a the spectra between 4000 and 800 cm 1 were recorded and 64 scans were averaged for each spectrum at a spectral resolution of 4 cm 1 the spectrum of the clean znse crystal was recorded as the background spectrum 1 ml of 0 1 wt membrane solution pvdf in n n dimethylformamide was dropped onto the znse crystal and dried overnight at 60 c as reported by wang et al 2015a after the measurement of the spectrum of the pvdf coated znse crystal 1 5 ml of background solution 10 mm sodium chloride was added into the sample cell and the spectra were measured for 5 h until they remained unchanged subsequently the background solution was replaced by the bsa or lys working solution and the final concentration was 6 5 mg ml to obtain a spectrum with a relatively good signal to noise ratio the spectra were collected every 2 min and the total sampling time was 398 min the ph of the protein solution which was measured after the experiment was terminated within 0 2 ph units of its initial value suggesting that the ph was relatively stable in the entire adsorption process 2 4 atomic force microscopy afm imaging the clean silicon wafers 5 5 mm2 were coated with the pvdf membrane and then immersed in the 6 5 mg ml protein solution 10 mm sodium chloride ph 7 0 for 5 20 100 and 300 min the morphology of the pvdf membrane surface before and after the protein fouling was imaged using an afm bruker dimension icon germany the tapping mode was operated using rtespa 300 etched silicon probes with a force constant of 40 n m the scanning speed was 1 hz and the scan area was 5 5 μm2 the detailed information about afm imaging is given in the supplementary material 2 5 quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation qcm d measurement the adsorption behaviors of bsa and lys on the membrane surface were also examined using a qcm d qsense e4 gothenburg sweden the au sensor qsx301 qsense was pre cleaned by the piranha solution oxygen plasma and ultrapure water and then dried by ultrapure n2 the cleaned sensor was spin coated with 30 μl of the 0 5 wt pvdf solution at 2000 rpm for 60 s with a kw 4a5 spin coater institute of microelectronics cas china followed by drying at 80 c for 30 min hashino et al 2011 the freshly coated sensor crystal was placed in the flow chamber to conduct the qcm d measurements the 10 mm sodium chloride background solution was fed into the flow chamber at a flow rate of 100 μl min to stabilize the sensors after a stable baseline was obtained the 6 5 mg ml protein solution 10 mm sodium chloride ph 7 0 was injected into the chamber the changes in both resonance frequency δf and dissipation δd were simultaneously monitored at each overtone n 1 3 5 7 9 in the adsorption process and the sampling interval was 1 5 s the adsorption mass of proteins was calculated by the sauerbrey equation and the plot of δd against δf reflects the viscoelasticity of the adsorption layer for simplicity the value for the 3rd overtone of both frequency and dissipation are reported herein wang et al 2015a 2 6 data analysis opus ver 5 5 bruker co germany matlab ver r2015a and 2dshige ver 1 3 shigeaki morita japan were used for spectral preprocessing mcr als and 2dcos analysis respectively the workflow is shown in fig 1b and a detailed description of the method theory is provided in the supplementary material firstly the atr ftir spectra of the pvdf coated znse crystal the background solution and the adsorbed protein on the pvdf membrane were preprocessed with opus for atmosphere compensation and baseline correction then these spectra were truncated to the region 2200 1300 cm 1 the spectral contributions from the pvdf membrane and background solution were subtracted from the time dependent spectra of the adsorbed protein on the pvdf membrane and thus the obtained spectral signals primarily derived from the adsorbed protein to perform a satisfactory spectral subtraction the baseline between 2000 and 1800 cm 1 must be straight and the 2125 cm 1 band of water was used as an internal standard haris and severcan 1999 zhou et al 2017 the area of the amide ii band of 1580 1480 cm 1 was used to evaluate the adsorption kinetic curve of proteins schmidt and martinez 2016 xu and grassian 2017 in addition it is also possible to quantify the amount of adsorbed proteins by the atr ftir spectroscopy with several given parameters such as the absorption coefficient of the absorbent and refractive index of the polymer layer which deserves a further study ishiguro et al 2005 the changes in the secondary structure of adsorbed proteins were resolved by the amide i band before the mcr als and 2dcos analysis the amide i band 1710 1580 cm 1 were baseline corrected and normalized by its integral to reduce the influence of concentration changes in the interaction process schmidt and martinez 2016 wang et al 2015b afterwards the preprocessed spectra of the amide i region were successively fed into the mcr als and 2dcos analysis to obtain the conformational information mcr als analysis assumes that each spectrum is a linear combination of the independent contributions of various components and noise therefore it could decompose the spectral dataset into the product of two smaller matrices containing the concentration profiles and the spectra of the corresponding components shashilov and lednev 2010 in the calculation singular value decomposition svd and evolving factor analysis efa were firstly performed to confirm the number of pure components the latter was also used to obtain the initial estimation of the concentration matrix an iterative als optimization was then carried out until convergence with the non negativity of the concentration profiles and the pure spectra of the chemical species as the constraints the quality of the mcr model was evaluated by two parameters i e lack of fit lof and variance explained r2 as described previously atifi et al 2013 wagner et al 2016 the obtained pure spectra of the various components can represent the pure secondary structure or the reaction specific species e g the intermediate in protein unfolding alcaraz et al 2017 shashilov and lednev 2010 the concentration matrix reflects the reaction kinetics of the chemical species and provides the basis for the segmentation of the spectral dataset in the subsequent 2dcos analysis 2dcos belongs to a different group of chemometric methods compared to mcr als analysis 2dcos has the advantage of distinguishing one band from another by spreading the original spectra along a second dimension in addition the specific sequence order of different chemical groups with the external perturbation could also be deduced chen et al 2019 schmidt and martinez 2016 it is worth noted that the 2dcos is limited to the monotone changes only otherwise the spectral dataset should be subjected to the 2dcos analysis separately in the 2dcos analysis the synchronous and asynchronous correlation intensities are generated the synchronous map φ x 1 x 2 reflects the overall similarity or the coincidental nature between the two spectral variables changes with the external perturbation the variable x is the wavenumber of the atr ftir spectra herein if φ x 1 x 2 0 the spectral intensities at x 1 x 2 increase or decrease in the same direction as the function of an external variable in reverse the sign of φ x 1 x 2 becomes negative when the changing direction is opposite the asynchronous map ψ x 1 x 2 represents the out of phase or sequential changes of the signal intensities at x 1 x 2 chen et al 2019 according to the noda s rule if the signs of φ x 1 x 2 and ψ x 1 x 2 are the same the overall spectral intensity at x 1 predominantly changes prior to that at x 2 if the signs are different the order is reversed chen et al 2019 3 results and discussion 3 1 ftir spectra the preprocessed spectra of the bsa and lys adsorbed on the membrane are shown in fig 2 in which the profiles were in good agreement with the typical atr ftir spectra of proteins schmidt and martinez 2016 there was no characteristic band in the region of 1800 2000 cm 1 indicating that the water signal was successfully removed haris and severcan 1999 amide i co stretching vibration and amide ii peaks n h bending and c n stretching modes were located at 1645 and 1545 cm 1 respectively the amide i band corresponded to various secondary structures such as α helices β sheets turns and random coils the peak at 1455 cm 1 was assigned to the scissoring mode of the side chain ch2 and that at 1405 cm 1 was associated with the symmetric stretching vibration of coo xu and grassian 2017 the notably increased spectral intensities could be attributed to the increasing amounts of proteins adsorbed on the pvdf membrane over time the amide i bands showed a red shift of the peak position for both bsa and lys over time and the spectral profiles were remarkably broadened in the first few minutes fig s2 this result suggests that the hydrophobic pvdf membrane induced the rapid structural changes of proteins which would be demonstrated below 3 2 protein adsorption kinetics the key advantage of in situ atr ftir spectroscopy is that it enables the characterization of both the time dependent conformational changes and the kinetics of protein adsorption simultaneously compared to the amide i region the amide ii band is less sensitive to the structural rearrangement or potential aggregation therefore the amide ii band area was used to monitor the extent of protein adsorption schmidt and martinez 2016 fig s3 shows the adsorption kinetic curves for bsa and lys on the pvdf membrane surface the curves consisted of a short period of rapid initial rise and then a long quasi linear region and no adsorption equilibrium was reached this is in good agreement with the previous work and suggests the multilayer adsorption of bsa and lys on the membrane holmberg and hou 2009 wei et al 2009 in the short initial rapid adsorption region the first few layers of proteins were adsorbed which covered the membrane surface mainly depending on the protein surface interaction the driving force varied with the adsorption time resulting in the observed rapid and nonlinear kinetic curve at this stage the kinetics curve was similar for both bsa and lys several reasons might be responsible for such a result on the one hand the protein surface contains various patches or domains with charges bsa or lys tended to expose the positively charged region to the negatively charged pvdf surface rabe et al 2011 wasilewska and adamczyk 2011 on the other hand the hydrophobic surface could induce conformational changes of proteins and have a great influence on their adsorption behaviors the highly deformed structure would result in a fast adsorption rate for bsa onto the hydrophobic surfaces du et al 2014 in the quasi linear region the driving force was nearly constant and should be influenced primarily by the protein protein and protein solvent interactions holmberg and hou 2009 wei et al 2009 the adsorption rate was higher for lys which might result from the smaller electrostatic repulsion between protein and protein as shown in table s1 bsa carried more charges than lys at ph 7 0 the multilayer adsorption phenomena are often observed in the interaction between proteins and polymer surfaces such as the adsorption of immunoglobulin g and albumin onto the polyethylene terephthalate membrane catalase and fibrinogen onto the polysulfone membrane and bsa and β lactoglobulin onto poly diallyldimethylammonium chloride membrane holmberg and hou 2009 matsusaki et al 2008 silva et al 2010 3 3 conformational transition of bsa on pvdf membrane the spectral features of various secondary structures were highly overlapped in the amide i region hence the integrated analysis of mcr als and 2dcos was performed to probe the adsorption induced conformational changes of the proteins the mcr als provides the pure spectra of the chemical components and the corresponding concentration profiles the former offers a picture of the reaction specific species and the latter depicts the reaction process the secondary structural changes of the adsorbed bsa can t be obtained straightforward by mcr als which could be remedied by 2dcos it is worth noting that if the intermediate conformation appears during the interaction the transition point of its concentration would also be determined by the mcr als helping to split the time dependent spectra into different sections the spectra of each section should be then subjected to the 2dcos analysis separately otherwise the interpretations of the sequential order of the intensity changes could be erroneous fig 1 shashilov and lednev 2009 the analysis of the time resolved spectra of adsorbed bsa was taken as an example to demonstrate the approach in detail in the mcr als analysis the number of components in the spectral dataset was firstly determined by the svd and efa results fig s4 the singular values related to the chemical components are supposed to be much larger than other possible contributions such as noise or instrumental drift efa offers additional information on the principle factors as well as their emergence and disappearance in the reaction process in fig s4b three clear emergent profiles are present in the forward direction while two in the backward direction the svd and efa analyses indicate that there should be two or three components in the time series of bsa spectra atifi et al 2013 del rio et al 2009 the mcr als analysis with two or three components was then performed and the residual spectra are shown in fig s5 when assuming the existence of three components the residual spectral intensities were randomly distributed and the convergence was completed after 19 iterations with an r2 of 99 99 and lof of 1 18 these values indicate that the three component mcr als decomposition fitted with the experimental data very well fig 3 depicts the concentration profiles and pure spectra of the chemical species resolved from the adsorption process of bsa the concentration profiles clearly demonstrate that the overall conformational transition of bsa on the pvdf membrane was a two step reaction i e a b c shashilov and lednev 2009 the intermediate b s spectrum showed an intense peak between 1630 and 1640 cm 1 indicating the presence of extended chains β sheets xu and grassian 2017 its concentration showed an initial increase and later decrease trend with a peak at around 22 min this served as an important basis for the segmental mode of the subsequent 2dcos analysis the spectra recorded during 0 22 and 22 398 min were subjected to the 2dcos analysis separately and the results are shown in fig 4 the band positions derived from the 2dcos plots are summarized in tables s2 and s3 for the spectra recorded from 0 to 22 min there were five auto correlation peaks along the diagonal line of the synchronous map i e 1614 1629 1656 1671 and 1683 cm 1 indicating that these peaks changed significantly with time the cross correlation peak at 1696 1629 cm 1 off the diagonal suggests that there was also a peak at 1696 cm 1 which was closely related to that at 1629 cm 1 five negative cross correlation peaks were located at 1696 1629 1683 1629 1671 1629 1656 1629 and 1656 1614 cm 1 and two positive cross correlation peaks were observed at 1671 1656 and 1629 1614 cm 1 suggesting that the spectral intensities at 1614 and 1629 cm 1 increased with time while the spectral intensities at 1656 1671 1683 and 1696 cm 1 decreased according to the cross correlation peaks at 1659 1651 and 1635 1624 cm 1 in the asynchronous map the peak at 1656 cm 1 was the overlapping of those at 1651 and 1659 cm 1 and the peak at 1629 cm 1 was the overlapping of those at 1624 and 1635 cm 1 the sequential changes of the secondary structure of bsa could be determined by the location and signs of cross correlation peaks φ x 1 x 2 and ψ x 1 x 2 1671 cm 1 turns 1635 cm 1 extended chains β sheets 1614 cm 1 side chains 1659 cm 1 α helices random coils 1624 cm 1 β sheets 1651 cm 1 α helices random coils 1683 cm 1 turns luo et al 2011 schmidt and martinez 2016 wei et al 2009 the horizontal arrow denotes the sequence of occurrence along with the prolonged adsorption time while up or down arrow indicates increase or decrease in their population respectively the sequential order demonstrates that the extended chain β sheet and side chain structures increased at the expense of turns and then the more rigid secondary structure α helices became unfolded leading to the increment of β sheets as for the 2dcos analysis of the second set of spectra 22 398 min there were four auto correlation peaks at 1695 1682 1657 and 1620 cm 1 in the synchronous map fig 4c three negative cross correlation peaks were located at 1695 1657 1682 1657 and 1657 1620 cm 1 and three positive cross correlation peaks were located at 1695 1682 1695 1620 and 1682 1620 cm 1 the signs of the cross correlation peaks φ x 1 x 2 suggest that except for the band at 1657 cm 1 all the other spectral features increased with time the cross correlation peaks φ x 1 x 2 in the wavenumber region 1700 1680 cm 1 x 1 direction against 1640 1600 cm 1 x 2 direction showed the opposite signs in the synchronous maps derived from the spectra measured during 0 22 min and 22 398 min indicating the necessity of the segmentation of the spectral dataset in the asynchronous map the cross correlation peak at 1686 1680 cm 1 suggests the spectral signal at 1682 cm 1 should be the overlapping of 1686 and 1680 cm 1 in addition the cross correlation peaks ψ x 1 x 2 at 1619 1612 1628 1619 and 1635 1628 cm 1 indicate that the band at 1620 cm 1 in the synchronous map could derive from the bands at 1612 1619 1628 and 1635 cm 1 within the 22 398 min the sequence of the structural changes was 1686 cm 1 turns 1680 cm 1 turns 1635 cm 1 extended chains β sheets 1619 cm 1 side chains 1612 cm 1 side chains 1657 α helices random coils 1628 cm 1 β sheets 1695 cm 1 β sheets mallamace et al 2018 schmidt and martinez 2016 the bands at 1628 and 1695 cm 1 are assigned to the antiparallel β sheet structure suggesting the intermolecular association or the gelation of the unfolded bsa luo et al 2011 mallamace et al 2018 the above results show that when bsa was adsorbed onto the pvdf membrane two distinct transitions were identified by the mcr als analysis and a detailed view of the spectral changes in each stage was further interpreted by the 2dcos analysis in the aqueous solution bsa kept its native form in which the hydrophobic part of bsa was normally encapsulated by a hydrophilic shell holmberg and hou 2009 when bsa approached to the hydrophobic membrane surface the protein spread and unfolded to a more open less structured state resulting in an increase in molecular dimensions and the exposure of the internal hydrophobic groups therefore the protein could adhere onto the membrane surface strongly the hydrophilic amino acid moieties might dangle to the exterior and interact with the aqueous environment luo et al 2011 mortensen and williams 2016 subsequently the denatured bsa tended to aggregate which may result in the pore blockage and accelerate the membrane fouling goli et al 2012 steinhauer et al 2015 previous studies reported that the unfolded proteins were more vulnerable to aggregation than the native proteins probably resulting from the decrease in electrostatic repulsions and higher probability of protein protein interaction chiti and dobson 2009 treuheit et al 2002 3 4 conformational changes of lys on pvdf membrane the integrated methodology was also applied to analyze the interaction between lys and the pvdf membrane according to the svd and efa analysis as well as the residual spectra the number of the secondary structure of adsorbed lys was equal to three figs s6 and s7 the concentration profiles and the corresponding spectra of pure component resolved are shown in fig s8 suggesting that the reaction path of the lys conformation was a b c a comparison between the extracted spectra of bsa and lys shows that lys deformed less when transformed from the native conformation a to the intermediate one b this could result from the fact that bsa is a soft protein and lys is a hard one as indicated by the lower adiabatic compressibility of lys in table s1 du et al 2014 thus bsa underwent considerable structural changes upon adsorption onto the pvdf surface as compared to lys which underwent limited structural rearrangements due to its stronger internal cohesion goli et al 2012 mucksch and urbassek 2016 in addition the maximum concentration of lys intermediate conformation was located at around 20 min therefore the spectra of the adsorbed lys were split into two groups i e 0 20 min and 20 398 min and the 2dcos analysis was performed separately fig s9 the band positions derived from the 2dcos plots are summarized in tables s4 and s5 based on the synchronous and asynchronous maps the order of spectral intensity changes of the adsorbed lys within the time period 0 20 min was 1695 cm 1 β sheets 1635 cm 1 extended chains β sheets 1680 cm 1 turns 1616 cm 1 side chains 1662 cm 1 turns 1651 cm 1 α helices random coils 1626 cm 1 β sheets 1657 cm 1 α helices random coils this sequence implies that lys underwent unfolding when adsorbed on the pvdf membrane with a decrease in α helices random coils and an increase in extended chains β sheets and side chains within the time period 20 398 min the sequence of the lys spectral changes was 1687 cm 1 turns 1678 cm 1 turns 1626 cm 1 β sheets 1606 cm 1 side chains 1616 cm 1 side chains 1662 cm 1 random coils α helices 1657 cm 1 random coils α helices 1697 cm 1 β sheets the increase in the band intensities at 1626 and 1697 cm 1 suggests the formation of the anti parallel β sheet structure which is associated with the intermolecular association and gelation of proteins lad et al 2006 the conformational transition process of lys on the pvdf membrane was analogues to that of bsa both of which underwent a native to partially unfolded to aggregation transition this result implies that although various forces such as electrostatic and hydrophobic effects can contribute to the interaction between proteins and membranes the hydrophobic characteristic of membrane was the dominant cause for the conformational changes of proteins moreover several previous studies have shown that lys can unfold and aggregate through hydrophobic effect leading to the formation of particulates or nonfibrillar large aggregates under high temperature and neutral near neutral ph conditions yang et al 2015 3 5 conformational changes of proteins confirmed by afm and qcm d to further understand the protein conformational changes on the pvdf membranes the fresh and fouled pvdf membranes by bsa and lys at different times were imaged by afm figs s10 and s11 in fig s10 the irregular valley dark portion and peak structure bright portion indicate the rough surface of the unfouled pvdf membrane in fig s11 the proteins were well distributed across the surface and the black arrows pointed to the typical morphologies of the adsorbed proteins the small globule with a flat adsorbate layer around was likely to be attributed to the partially unfolded protein barinov et al 2016 for bsa after 5 min adsorption both the small globular structure and the partially unfolded structure were observed and the amount of the partially unfolded structure significantly increased over time 20 min subsequently the partially unfolded structure was transformed into a disk like structure and stacked onto the pvdf surface 100 and 300 min a similar result was obtained for lys this result reflects the three primary conformations of the adsorbed proteins on the pvdf membrane in consistence with our atr ftir results the qcm d measurement was also performed to monitor the adsorption process of proteins onto the pvdf membrane because of the variable pvdf membrane thickness deposited between atr ftir and qcm d measurements the adsorption kinetics could not be compared zhao et al 2011 however the plot of δd against δf termed as d f plots has been proven informative on the viscoelastic properties of the adsorption layers and thus is discussed herein when the slope d f is high a soft adsorption layer is formed whereas a rigid layer is formed in the case of a low slope condition thus the d f plot could also reflect the conformational changes of macromolecules at surfaces hashino et al 2011 jia et al 2015 fig s12 displays the d f plots of the adsorption process of bsa and lys on the membrane surface apparently the data exhibited three stages with different values of the slopes d f at the first stage the slope was very small demonstrating that the adsorption of proteins had little effect on the dissipation this could be understood as the process of proteins occupying the empty pvdf surface in which the proteins took a rigid native globular structure containing a large amount of α helix structure at the second stage the data sets of bsa and lys both exhibited larger slopes than that at the first stage indicating the formation of a soft layer which caused significant energy dissipation the proteins were supposed to take a partially unfolded structure with the increased amount of the side chains and extended chains β sheets corresponding to the shape of the small globule with a flat adsorbate layer around as imaged by afm at the third stage the slope became very small again the rigid protein layer might result from the disk like shape with the formation of the antiparallel β sheet structure as a result the afm and qcm d data as well as the atr ftir results demonstrate a native to partially unfolded to aggregation structural transition in the adsorption process of proteins onto the pvdf membrane in addition the adsorption amounts of bsa and lys calculated by δf were 462 and 2416 ng cm2 respectively the monolayer adsorption amount of bsa was 192 side on and 311 ng cm2 end on and that of lys was 115 side on and 172 ng cm2 end on goda and miyahara 2012 therefore the multilayer adsorption of bsa and lys might occur as evidenced by the higher experimental adsorption capacities which is also in accordance with the atr ftir result 3 6 mechanism for the protein membrane interaction with the above results the protein membrane interaction mechanism is proposed fig 5 initially the proteins were diffused in their native state from the bulk solution to the near surface region of the membrane and bind through initial contact sites to the surface since the protein surface contains various patches or domains with charges bsa or lys both tended to expose the positively charged region to the negatively charged pvdf surface rabe et al 2011 wasilewska and adamczyk 2011 afterwards the proteins close to the membrane surface lost the bound water and unfolded to a more open less structured state resulting in an increase in molecular dimensions and the exposure of the internal hydrophobic groups belfer et al 2000 the extent of the conformational deformation was related to the structural stability of proteins subsequently the unfolded proteins were inclined to aggregate resulting from the decrease in electrostatic repulsions and higher probability of protein protein interaction these aggregates could serve as nucleation points for the further association of protein molecules leading to multilayer adsorption sun et al 2008 the conformational rearrangement of proteins provides a plausible explanation for the earlier findings that the proteins can lead to the severe membrane fouling of the hydrophobic membranes even when the pore size was much larger than the protein molecular diameter steinhauer et al 2015 4 conclusions time dependent in situ atr ftir spectroscopy was applied to elucidate the interaction between proteins and membranes in this work a multivariate methodology integrating mcr als and 2dcos analysis was developed to demonstrate the dynamic changes of the conformation of proteins on the pvdf surface mcr als analysis reveals a two step reaction process for both bsa and lys on the membrane surface and determines the transition points of the concentration profiles of the intermediates 2dcos was then used to discern the sequence order of conformational changes for each stage the hydrophobic membrane surface initially induced the unfolding of bsa and lys the expanded structure increased the number of contact sites between proteins and membrane surface as well as the exposed hydrophobic groups assisting the strong adsorption and the subsequent aggregation of proteins on the membrane surface the similar behaviors of bsa and lys on the pvdf membrane indicate that the membrane surface hydrophobicity played the dominant role in the protein induced membrane fouling process in addition the conformational transition process of bsa and lys was further confirmed by the afm and qcm d measurements this work provides comprehensive understanding of the entire membrane fouling process caused by proteins and sheds light on the interaction mechanism at a molecular level which could help the development of membrane anti fouling approaches moreover the approach integrating the mcr als and 2dcos analysis is proven to yield a detailed view of spectral transitions without a priori knowledge thus exhibits a great perspective for the elucidation of other complex interactions in environments declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

17737,proteins are one of the major contributors to membrane fouling the interaction between proteins and the polymer membrane at the molecular level is essential for the alleviation prevention of membrane fouling but remains unclear in this work time dependent in situ attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy is applied to investigate the interaction process between two model proteins bovine serum albumin and lysozyme and the poly vinylidene fluoride pvdf membrane multivariate curve resolution alternating least squares is integrated with two dimensional correlation spectroscopy analysis to resolve the membrane induced conformational changes of proteins the multivariate curve resolution alternating least squares analysis reveals a two step process in the protein membrane interaction and provides the kinetics of the conformational transition which aids the segmentation of the spectral dataset by applying two dimensional correlation spectroscopy analysis to different groups of the time dependent spectra the sequential order of the secondary structural changes of proteins is determined the proteins initially undergo unfolding transition to a more open less structured state which appears to be triggered by the hydrophobic membrane surface afterwards the proteins become aggregated with the high anti parallel β sheet content aggravating the membrane fouling the conformational transition process of proteins was also confirmed by the atomic force microscopic images and quartz crystal microbalance measurement overall this work provides an in depth understanding of the interaction between proteins and the membrane surface which is helpful for the development of membrane anti fouling strategies graphical abstract image 1 keywords protein membrane fouling attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy multivariate curve resolution alternating least squares analysis two dimensional correlation spectroscopic analysis 1 introduction the implementation of membrane technology continues to increase in the field of water and wastewater treatment owing to its unique advantages such as the compact area of occupation high effluent quality and less residue chen et al 2018 yu et al 2019 however membrane fouling results in a significant decrease in membrane permeability selectivity and service lifetime and has become the primary problem for more widespread and large scale applications of membrane technology chen et al 2018 gao et al 2018 proteins are abundant in water and wastewater and are recognized as one of the major contributors to membrane fouling gao et al 2018 for instance proteins take up around 53 of the foulants after a four week operation of the seawater reverse osmosis membrane reactor khan et al 2013 they also play an important role in the irreversible fouling within a membrane bioreactor zhang et al 2017 therefore it is of great significance to investigate the fouling process caused by proteins numerous techniques have been used to explore the interaction mechanism between proteins and membranes and attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared atr ftir spectroscopy is an attractive tool owing to its characteristics such as non invasive surface sensitive and the capability to provide rich chemical information it has been widely used to characterize the membrane materials determine the thickness of the coating layers on the membranes identify the chemical state of water in the fouling process and examine the fouling layers on the membrane surface bass and freger 2015 belfer et al 2000 guo et al 2019 despite the extent and depth of these studies the microscopic mechanisms of protein fouling remain unrevealed on the one hand in these previous studies the ex situ atr ftir spectroscopy was used to monitor membrane fouling but failed to give comprehensive understanding of the entire fouling process since the membranes have to be moved out from the reactor and air dried the fouling layer might be damaged and the properties of the proteins might have been changed therefore an in situ online characterization is needed to monitor the reaction process at the solution membrane interface on the other hand the conformational changes of the proteins should be given attention as the conformational details of proteins are likely to significantly influence the extent and rate of membrane fouling langdon et al 2015 wang et al 2010 wei et al 2009 for instance thermal denaturing of bsa would expose more hydrophobic residues and result in an obvious flux decline compared to the native bsa liu et al 2018 however the potential of atr ftir spectroscopy for ascertaining the nature of proteins on the membranes is still limited owing to the severe spectral superposition to resolve the extensively overlapping spectral features curve fitting methods e g the gaussian lorentzian function and polynomial or linear least square procedures are generally used however the curve fitting results depend heavily on the artificially selected parameters such as the numbers positions shapes and width of the peaks li et al 2006 therefore sufficient prior knowledge about these parameters is required to accomplish the curve fitting analysis more recently multivariate curve resolution alternating least squares mcr als and two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2dcos have been introduced to analyze the atr ftir spectra and investigate the protein involved interactions schmidt and martinez 2016 shashilov and lednev 2010 mcr als allows for the mathematical resolution of concentration and spectral profiles of pure components from the raw dataset without a priori knowledge about the studied system hence it has been proven to be very useful to interpret the reaction processes alcaraz et al 2017 del rio et al 2009 li et al 2006 for instance mcr als has been successfully applied to resolve the intermediates in protein folding and the kinetic concentration profiles from the reaction based chemical sensors alcaraz et al 2017 shashilov and lednev 2010 2dcos which is based on covariance and or correlation analysis of the external perturbation induced variations is able to improve the spectral resolution chen et al 2019 schmidt and martinez 2016 most importantly 2dcos can provide the sequence of the peak intensity changes and the relationship between bands which aids the band assignment chen et al 2019 shashilov and lednev 2009 however the 2dcos methods are only suitable for the monotone changes otherwise the reaction sequence might be misinterpreted shashilov and lednev 2009 therefore segmentation of the spectral dataset into small blocks is required to capture the individual processes and assign the sequential orders of intensity changes without any ambiguity which could be accomplished on the basis of the mcr als results address these challenges we established an online and in situ atr ftir spectroscopic platform to monitor the membrane fouling process caused by proteins in this work an integrated approach of mcr als with 2dcos was developed to resolve the complex time dependent atr ftir spectra mcr als was used to extract the spectra and kinetic curve profiles of pure species of interest involved in the reaction process the kinetic profiles served as an important basis for the segmentation of perturbation ranges with the aid of 2dcos analysis the variation of the secondary structure of proteins and the sequential order of the conformational changes could be obtained in each perturbation range as a consequence a mechanistic insight into the complex protein membrane interaction could be provided which will be helpful for understanding the membrane fouling and developing anti fouling strategies the molecular behaviors of two model proteins bsa and lysozyme lys were examined at the interface of poly vinylidene fluoride pvdf membrane under neutral ph conditions bsa and lys carry negative and positive net charges respectively pvdf is a widely used membrane material and its intrinsic hydrophobicity causes easy adsorption of biomacromolecules and organic matter on the membrane surface leading to membrane fouling hashino et al 2011 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and samples all reagents and chemicals were of analytical grade and used as supplied without further purification pvdf powder sinopharm chemical reagent co china was dissolved in n n dimethylformamide to prepare a 0 5 wt membrane stock solution a 10 mm sodium chloride solution was prepared using ultrapure water and used as the background solution in the atr ftir measurement bsa and lys sangon biotech co china were dissolved respectively in 10 mm sodium chloride solution as the working solution wang and tang 2011 the sodium chloride herein was utilized to stabilize the ionic strength of the working solution the ph value of the working solution was adjusted to 7 0 with sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid since the isoelectric points for bsa and lys are ph 4 7 and 11 4 respectively bsa is negatively charged whereas lys is positively charged at ph 7 0 wang and tang 2011 the key characteristics of bsa and lys such as isoelectric point pi molecular weight structural flexibility and hydrophobicity related parameters are listed in table s1 the protein working solutions were freshly prepared prior to each atr ftir measurement 2 2 membrane characterizations a certain amount of pvdf membrane solution was dropped onto the cover slide and dried overnight at 60 c the contact angle and surface zeta potential were 89 and 47 mv respectively suggesting that the pvdf membrane was relatively hydrophobic and negatively charged fig s1 details of the membrane characterization methods are provided in the supplementary material 2 3 atr ftir measurement the atr ftir experiment was carried out with a vertex 70 ftir spectrometer bruker co germany the sample cell with a horizontal znse crystal 50 10 3 mm3 incident angle of 45 was amounted onto an atr accessory and exposed to the optical path of the spectrometer with an external nitrogen cooled mct detector fig 1 a the spectra between 4000 and 800 cm 1 were recorded and 64 scans were averaged for each spectrum at a spectral resolution of 4 cm 1 the spectrum of the clean znse crystal was recorded as the background spectrum 1 ml of 0 1 wt membrane solution pvdf in n n dimethylformamide was dropped onto the znse crystal and dried overnight at 60 c as reported by wang et al 2015a after the measurement of the spectrum of the pvdf coated znse crystal 1 5 ml of background solution 10 mm sodium chloride was added into the sample cell and the spectra were measured for 5 h until they remained unchanged subsequently the background solution was replaced by the bsa or lys working solution and the final concentration was 6 5 mg ml to obtain a spectrum with a relatively good signal to noise ratio the spectra were collected every 2 min and the total sampling time was 398 min the ph of the protein solution which was measured after the experiment was terminated within 0 2 ph units of its initial value suggesting that the ph was relatively stable in the entire adsorption process 2 4 atomic force microscopy afm imaging the clean silicon wafers 5 5 mm2 were coated with the pvdf membrane and then immersed in the 6 5 mg ml protein solution 10 mm sodium chloride ph 7 0 for 5 20 100 and 300 min the morphology of the pvdf membrane surface before and after the protein fouling was imaged using an afm bruker dimension icon germany the tapping mode was operated using rtespa 300 etched silicon probes with a force constant of 40 n m the scanning speed was 1 hz and the scan area was 5 5 μm2 the detailed information about afm imaging is given in the supplementary material 2 5 quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation qcm d measurement the adsorption behaviors of bsa and lys on the membrane surface were also examined using a qcm d qsense e4 gothenburg sweden the au sensor qsx301 qsense was pre cleaned by the piranha solution oxygen plasma and ultrapure water and then dried by ultrapure n2 the cleaned sensor was spin coated with 30 μl of the 0 5 wt pvdf solution at 2000 rpm for 60 s with a kw 4a5 spin coater institute of microelectronics cas china followed by drying at 80 c for 30 min hashino et al 2011 the freshly coated sensor crystal was placed in the flow chamber to conduct the qcm d measurements the 10 mm sodium chloride background solution was fed into the flow chamber at a flow rate of 100 μl min to stabilize the sensors after a stable baseline was obtained the 6 5 mg ml protein solution 10 mm sodium chloride ph 7 0 was injected into the chamber the changes in both resonance frequency δf and dissipation δd were simultaneously monitored at each overtone n 1 3 5 7 9 in the adsorption process and the sampling interval was 1 5 s the adsorption mass of proteins was calculated by the sauerbrey equation and the plot of δd against δf reflects the viscoelasticity of the adsorption layer for simplicity the value for the 3rd overtone of both frequency and dissipation are reported herein wang et al 2015a 2 6 data analysis opus ver 5 5 bruker co germany matlab ver r2015a and 2dshige ver 1 3 shigeaki morita japan were used for spectral preprocessing mcr als and 2dcos analysis respectively the workflow is shown in fig 1b and a detailed description of the method theory is provided in the supplementary material firstly the atr ftir spectra of the pvdf coated znse crystal the background solution and the adsorbed protein on the pvdf membrane were preprocessed with opus for atmosphere compensation and baseline correction then these spectra were truncated to the region 2200 1300 cm 1 the spectral contributions from the pvdf membrane and background solution were subtracted from the time dependent spectra of the adsorbed protein on the pvdf membrane and thus the obtained spectral signals primarily derived from the adsorbed protein to perform a satisfactory spectral subtraction the baseline between 2000 and 1800 cm 1 must be straight and the 2125 cm 1 band of water was used as an internal standard haris and severcan 1999 zhou et al 2017 the area of the amide ii band of 1580 1480 cm 1 was used to evaluate the adsorption kinetic curve of proteins schmidt and martinez 2016 xu and grassian 2017 in addition it is also possible to quantify the amount of adsorbed proteins by the atr ftir spectroscopy with several given parameters such as the absorption coefficient of the absorbent and refractive index of the polymer layer which deserves a further study ishiguro et al 2005 the changes in the secondary structure of adsorbed proteins were resolved by the amide i band before the mcr als and 2dcos analysis the amide i band 1710 1580 cm 1 were baseline corrected and normalized by its integral to reduce the influence of concentration changes in the interaction process schmidt and martinez 2016 wang et al 2015b afterwards the preprocessed spectra of the amide i region were successively fed into the mcr als and 2dcos analysis to obtain the conformational information mcr als analysis assumes that each spectrum is a linear combination of the independent contributions of various components and noise therefore it could decompose the spectral dataset into the product of two smaller matrices containing the concentration profiles and the spectra of the corresponding components shashilov and lednev 2010 in the calculation singular value decomposition svd and evolving factor analysis efa were firstly performed to confirm the number of pure components the latter was also used to obtain the initial estimation of the concentration matrix an iterative als optimization was then carried out until convergence with the non negativity of the concentration profiles and the pure spectra of the chemical species as the constraints the quality of the mcr model was evaluated by two parameters i e lack of fit lof and variance explained r2 as described previously atifi et al 2013 wagner et al 2016 the obtained pure spectra of the various components can represent the pure secondary structure or the reaction specific species e g the intermediate in protein unfolding alcaraz et al 2017 shashilov and lednev 2010 the concentration matrix reflects the reaction kinetics of the chemical species and provides the basis for the segmentation of the spectral dataset in the subsequent 2dcos analysis 2dcos belongs to a different group of chemometric methods compared to mcr als analysis 2dcos has the advantage of distinguishing one band from another by spreading the original spectra along a second dimension in addition the specific sequence order of different chemical groups with the external perturbation could also be deduced chen et al 2019 schmidt and martinez 2016 it is worth noted that the 2dcos is limited to the monotone changes only otherwise the spectral dataset should be subjected to the 2dcos analysis separately in the 2dcos analysis the synchronous and asynchronous correlation intensities are generated the synchronous map φ x 1 x 2 reflects the overall similarity or the coincidental nature between the two spectral variables changes with the external perturbation the variable x is the wavenumber of the atr ftir spectra herein if φ x 1 x 2 0 the spectral intensities at x 1 x 2 increase or decrease in the same direction as the function of an external variable in reverse the sign of φ x 1 x 2 becomes negative when the changing direction is opposite the asynchronous map ψ x 1 x 2 represents the out of phase or sequential changes of the signal intensities at x 1 x 2 chen et al 2019 according to the noda s rule if the signs of φ x 1 x 2 and ψ x 1 x 2 are the same the overall spectral intensity at x 1 predominantly changes prior to that at x 2 if the signs are different the order is reversed chen et al 2019 3 results and discussion 3 1 ftir spectra the preprocessed spectra of the bsa and lys adsorbed on the membrane are shown in fig 2 in which the profiles were in good agreement with the typical atr ftir spectra of proteins schmidt and martinez 2016 there was no characteristic band in the region of 1800 2000 cm 1 indicating that the water signal was successfully removed haris and severcan 1999 amide i co stretching vibration and amide ii peaks n h bending and c n stretching modes were located at 1645 and 1545 cm 1 respectively the amide i band corresponded to various secondary structures such as α helices β sheets turns and random coils the peak at 1455 cm 1 was assigned to the scissoring mode of the side chain ch2 and that at 1405 cm 1 was associated with the symmetric stretching vibration of coo xu and grassian 2017 the notably increased spectral intensities could be attributed to the increasing amounts of proteins adsorbed on the pvdf membrane over time the amide i bands showed a red shift of the peak position for both bsa and lys over time and the spectral profiles were remarkably broadened in the first few minutes fig s2 this result suggests that the hydrophobic pvdf membrane induced the rapid structural changes of proteins which would be demonstrated below 3 2 protein adsorption kinetics the key advantage of in situ atr ftir spectroscopy is that it enables the characterization of both the time dependent conformational changes and the kinetics of protein adsorption simultaneously compared to the amide i region the amide ii band is less sensitive to the structural rearrangement or potential aggregation therefore the amide ii band area was used to monitor the extent of protein adsorption schmidt and martinez 2016 fig s3 shows the adsorption kinetic curves for bsa and lys on the pvdf membrane surface the curves consisted of a short period of rapid initial rise and then a long quasi linear region and no adsorption equilibrium was reached this is in good agreement with the previous work and suggests the multilayer adsorption of bsa and lys on the membrane holmberg and hou 2009 wei et al 2009 in the short initial rapid adsorption region the first few layers of proteins were adsorbed which covered the membrane surface mainly depending on the protein surface interaction the driving force varied with the adsorption time resulting in the observed rapid and nonlinear kinetic curve at this stage the kinetics curve was similar for both bsa and lys several reasons might be responsible for such a result on the one hand the protein surface contains various patches or domains with charges bsa or lys tended to expose the positively charged region to the negatively charged pvdf surface rabe et al 2011 wasilewska and adamczyk 2011 on the other hand the hydrophobic surface could induce conformational changes of proteins and have a great influence on their adsorption behaviors the highly deformed structure would result in a fast adsorption rate for bsa onto the hydrophobic surfaces du et al 2014 in the quasi linear region the driving force was nearly constant and should be influenced primarily by the protein protein and protein solvent interactions holmberg and hou 2009 wei et al 2009 the adsorption rate was higher for lys which might result from the smaller electrostatic repulsion between protein and protein as shown in table s1 bsa carried more charges than lys at ph 7 0 the multilayer adsorption phenomena are often observed in the interaction between proteins and polymer surfaces such as the adsorption of immunoglobulin g and albumin onto the polyethylene terephthalate membrane catalase and fibrinogen onto the polysulfone membrane and bsa and β lactoglobulin onto poly diallyldimethylammonium chloride membrane holmberg and hou 2009 matsusaki et al 2008 silva et al 2010 3 3 conformational transition of bsa on pvdf membrane the spectral features of various secondary structures were highly overlapped in the amide i region hence the integrated analysis of mcr als and 2dcos was performed to probe the adsorption induced conformational changes of the proteins the mcr als provides the pure spectra of the chemical components and the corresponding concentration profiles the former offers a picture of the reaction specific species and the latter depicts the reaction process the secondary structural changes of the adsorbed bsa can t be obtained straightforward by mcr als which could be remedied by 2dcos it is worth noting that if the intermediate conformation appears during the interaction the transition point of its concentration would also be determined by the mcr als helping to split the time dependent spectra into different sections the spectra of each section should be then subjected to the 2dcos analysis separately otherwise the interpretations of the sequential order of the intensity changes could be erroneous fig 1 shashilov and lednev 2009 the analysis of the time resolved spectra of adsorbed bsa was taken as an example to demonstrate the approach in detail in the mcr als analysis the number of components in the spectral dataset was firstly determined by the svd and efa results fig s4 the singular values related to the chemical components are supposed to be much larger than other possible contributions such as noise or instrumental drift efa offers additional information on the principle factors as well as their emergence and disappearance in the reaction process in fig s4b three clear emergent profiles are present in the forward direction while two in the backward direction the svd and efa analyses indicate that there should be two or three components in the time series of bsa spectra atifi et al 2013 del rio et al 2009 the mcr als analysis with two or three components was then performed and the residual spectra are shown in fig s5 when assuming the existence of three components the residual spectral intensities were randomly distributed and the convergence was completed after 19 iterations with an r2 of 99 99 and lof of 1 18 these values indicate that the three component mcr als decomposition fitted with the experimental data very well fig 3 depicts the concentration profiles and pure spectra of the chemical species resolved from the adsorption process of bsa the concentration profiles clearly demonstrate that the overall conformational transition of bsa on the pvdf membrane was a two step reaction i e a b c shashilov and lednev 2009 the intermediate b s spectrum showed an intense peak between 1630 and 1640 cm 1 indicating the presence of extended chains β sheets xu and grassian 2017 its concentration showed an initial increase and later decrease trend with a peak at around 22 min this served as an important basis for the segmental mode of the subsequent 2dcos analysis the spectra recorded during 0 22 and 22 398 min were subjected to the 2dcos analysis separately and the results are shown in fig 4 the band positions derived from the 2dcos plots are summarized in tables s2 and s3 for the spectra recorded from 0 to 22 min there were five auto correlation peaks along the diagonal line of the synchronous map i e 1614 1629 1656 1671 and 1683 cm 1 indicating that these peaks changed significantly with time the cross correlation peak at 1696 1629 cm 1 off the diagonal suggests that there was also a peak at 1696 cm 1 which was closely related to that at 1629 cm 1 five negative cross correlation peaks were located at 1696 1629 1683 1629 1671 1629 1656 1629 and 1656 1614 cm 1 and two positive cross correlation peaks were observed at 1671 1656 and 1629 1614 cm 1 suggesting that the spectral intensities at 1614 and 1629 cm 1 increased with time while the spectral intensities at 1656 1671 1683 and 1696 cm 1 decreased according to the cross correlation peaks at 1659 1651 and 1635 1624 cm 1 in the asynchronous map the peak at 1656 cm 1 was the overlapping of those at 1651 and 1659 cm 1 and the peak at 1629 cm 1 was the overlapping of those at 1624 and 1635 cm 1 the sequential changes of the secondary structure of bsa could be determined by the location and signs of cross correlation peaks φ x 1 x 2 and ψ x 1 x 2 1671 cm 1 turns 1635 cm 1 extended chains β sheets 1614 cm 1 side chains 1659 cm 1 α helices random coils 1624 cm 1 β sheets 1651 cm 1 α helices random coils 1683 cm 1 turns luo et al 2011 schmidt and martinez 2016 wei et al 2009 the horizontal arrow denotes the sequence of occurrence along with the prolonged adsorption time while up or down arrow indicates increase or decrease in their population respectively the sequential order demonstrates that the extended chain β sheet and side chain structures increased at the expense of turns and then the more rigid secondary structure α helices became unfolded leading to the increment of β sheets as for the 2dcos analysis of the second set of spectra 22 398 min there were four auto correlation peaks at 1695 1682 1657 and 1620 cm 1 in the synchronous map fig 4c three negative cross correlation peaks were located at 1695 1657 1682 1657 and 1657 1620 cm 1 and three positive cross correlation peaks were located at 1695 1682 1695 1620 and 1682 1620 cm 1 the signs of the cross correlation peaks φ x 1 x 2 suggest that except for the band at 1657 cm 1 all the other spectral features increased with time the cross correlation peaks φ x 1 x 2 in the wavenumber region 1700 1680 cm 1 x 1 direction against 1640 1600 cm 1 x 2 direction showed the opposite signs in the synchronous maps derived from the spectra measured during 0 22 min and 22 398 min indicating the necessity of the segmentation of the spectral dataset in the asynchronous map the cross correlation peak at 1686 1680 cm 1 suggests the spectral signal at 1682 cm 1 should be the overlapping of 1686 and 1680 cm 1 in addition the cross correlation peaks ψ x 1 x 2 at 1619 1612 1628 1619 and 1635 1628 cm 1 indicate that the band at 1620 cm 1 in the synchronous map could derive from the bands at 1612 1619 1628 and 1635 cm 1 within the 22 398 min the sequence of the structural changes was 1686 cm 1 turns 1680 cm 1 turns 1635 cm 1 extended chains β sheets 1619 cm 1 side chains 1612 cm 1 side chains 1657 α helices random coils 1628 cm 1 β sheets 1695 cm 1 β sheets mallamace et al 2018 schmidt and martinez 2016 the bands at 1628 and 1695 cm 1 are assigned to the antiparallel β sheet structure suggesting the intermolecular association or the gelation of the unfolded bsa luo et al 2011 mallamace et al 2018 the above results show that when bsa was adsorbed onto the pvdf membrane two distinct transitions were identified by the mcr als analysis and a detailed view of the spectral changes in each stage was further interpreted by the 2dcos analysis in the aqueous solution bsa kept its native form in which the hydrophobic part of bsa was normally encapsulated by a hydrophilic shell holmberg and hou 2009 when bsa approached to the hydrophobic membrane surface the protein spread and unfolded to a more open less structured state resulting in an increase in molecular dimensions and the exposure of the internal hydrophobic groups therefore the protein could adhere onto the membrane surface strongly the hydrophilic amino acid moieties might dangle to the exterior and interact with the aqueous environment luo et al 2011 mortensen and williams 2016 subsequently the denatured bsa tended to aggregate which may result in the pore blockage and accelerate the membrane fouling goli et al 2012 steinhauer et al 2015 previous studies reported that the unfolded proteins were more vulnerable to aggregation than the native proteins probably resulting from the decrease in electrostatic repulsions and higher probability of protein protein interaction chiti and dobson 2009 treuheit et al 2002 3 4 conformational changes of lys on pvdf membrane the integrated methodology was also applied to analyze the interaction between lys and the pvdf membrane according to the svd and efa analysis as well as the residual spectra the number of the secondary structure of adsorbed lys was equal to three figs s6 and s7 the concentration profiles and the corresponding spectra of pure component resolved are shown in fig s8 suggesting that the reaction path of the lys conformation was a b c a comparison between the extracted spectra of bsa and lys shows that lys deformed less when transformed from the native conformation a to the intermediate one b this could result from the fact that bsa is a soft protein and lys is a hard one as indicated by the lower adiabatic compressibility of lys in table s1 du et al 2014 thus bsa underwent considerable structural changes upon adsorption onto the pvdf surface as compared to lys which underwent limited structural rearrangements due to its stronger internal cohesion goli et al 2012 mucksch and urbassek 2016 in addition the maximum concentration of lys intermediate conformation was located at around 20 min therefore the spectra of the adsorbed lys were split into two groups i e 0 20 min and 20 398 min and the 2dcos analysis was performed separately fig s9 the band positions derived from the 2dcos plots are summarized in tables s4 and s5 based on the synchronous and asynchronous maps the order of spectral intensity changes of the adsorbed lys within the time period 0 20 min was 1695 cm 1 β sheets 1635 cm 1 extended chains β sheets 1680 cm 1 turns 1616 cm 1 side chains 1662 cm 1 turns 1651 cm 1 α helices random coils 1626 cm 1 β sheets 1657 cm 1 α helices random coils this sequence implies that lys underwent unfolding when adsorbed on the pvdf membrane with a decrease in α helices random coils and an increase in extended chains β sheets and side chains within the time period 20 398 min the sequence of the lys spectral changes was 1687 cm 1 turns 1678 cm 1 turns 1626 cm 1 β sheets 1606 cm 1 side chains 1616 cm 1 side chains 1662 cm 1 random coils α helices 1657 cm 1 random coils α helices 1697 cm 1 β sheets the increase in the band intensities at 1626 and 1697 cm 1 suggests the formation of the anti parallel β sheet structure which is associated with the intermolecular association and gelation of proteins lad et al 2006 the conformational transition process of lys on the pvdf membrane was analogues to that of bsa both of which underwent a native to partially unfolded to aggregation transition this result implies that although various forces such as electrostatic and hydrophobic effects can contribute to the interaction between proteins and membranes the hydrophobic characteristic of membrane was the dominant cause for the conformational changes of proteins moreover several previous studies have shown that lys can unfold and aggregate through hydrophobic effect leading to the formation of particulates or nonfibrillar large aggregates under high temperature and neutral near neutral ph conditions yang et al 2015 3 5 conformational changes of proteins confirmed by afm and qcm d to further understand the protein conformational changes on the pvdf membranes the fresh and fouled pvdf membranes by bsa and lys at different times were imaged by afm figs s10 and s11 in fig s10 the irregular valley dark portion and peak structure bright portion indicate the rough surface of the unfouled pvdf membrane in fig s11 the proteins were well distributed across the surface and the black arrows pointed to the typical morphologies of the adsorbed proteins the small globule with a flat adsorbate layer around was likely to be attributed to the partially unfolded protein barinov et al 2016 for bsa after 5 min adsorption both the small globular structure and the partially unfolded structure were observed and the amount of the partially unfolded structure significantly increased over time 20 min subsequently the partially unfolded structure was transformed into a disk like structure and stacked onto the pvdf surface 100 and 300 min a similar result was obtained for lys this result reflects the three primary conformations of the adsorbed proteins on the pvdf membrane in consistence with our atr ftir results the qcm d measurement was also performed to monitor the adsorption process of proteins onto the pvdf membrane because of the variable pvdf membrane thickness deposited between atr ftir and qcm d measurements the adsorption kinetics could not be compared zhao et al 2011 however the plot of δd against δf termed as d f plots has been proven informative on the viscoelastic properties of the adsorption layers and thus is discussed herein when the slope d f is high a soft adsorption layer is formed whereas a rigid layer is formed in the case of a low slope condition thus the d f plot could also reflect the conformational changes of macromolecules at surfaces hashino et al 2011 jia et al 2015 fig s12 displays the d f plots of the adsorption process of bsa and lys on the membrane surface apparently the data exhibited three stages with different values of the slopes d f at the first stage the slope was very small demonstrating that the adsorption of proteins had little effect on the dissipation this could be understood as the process of proteins occupying the empty pvdf surface in which the proteins took a rigid native globular structure containing a large amount of α helix structure at the second stage the data sets of bsa and lys both exhibited larger slopes than that at the first stage indicating the formation of a soft layer which caused significant energy dissipation the proteins were supposed to take a partially unfolded structure with the increased amount of the side chains and extended chains β sheets corresponding to the shape of the small globule with a flat adsorbate layer around as imaged by afm at the third stage the slope became very small again the rigid protein layer might result from the disk like shape with the formation of the antiparallel β sheet structure as a result the afm and qcm d data as well as the atr ftir results demonstrate a native to partially unfolded to aggregation structural transition in the adsorption process of proteins onto the pvdf membrane in addition the adsorption amounts of bsa and lys calculated by δf were 462 and 2416 ng cm2 respectively the monolayer adsorption amount of bsa was 192 side on and 311 ng cm2 end on and that of lys was 115 side on and 172 ng cm2 end on goda and miyahara 2012 therefore the multilayer adsorption of bsa and lys might occur as evidenced by the higher experimental adsorption capacities which is also in accordance with the atr ftir result 3 6 mechanism for the protein membrane interaction with the above results the protein membrane interaction mechanism is proposed fig 5 initially the proteins were diffused in their native state from the bulk solution to the near surface region of the membrane and bind through initial contact sites to the surface since the protein surface contains various patches or domains with charges bsa or lys both tended to expose the positively charged region to the negatively charged pvdf surface rabe et al 2011 wasilewska and adamczyk 2011 afterwards the proteins close to the membrane surface lost the bound water and unfolded to a more open less structured state resulting in an increase in molecular dimensions and the exposure of the internal hydrophobic groups belfer et al 2000 the extent of the conformational deformation was related to the structural stability of proteins subsequently the unfolded proteins were inclined to aggregate resulting from the decrease in electrostatic repulsions and higher probability of protein protein interaction these aggregates could serve as nucleation points for the further association of protein molecules leading to multilayer adsorption sun et al 2008 the conformational rearrangement of proteins provides a plausible explanation for the earlier findings that the proteins can lead to the severe membrane fouling of the hydrophobic membranes even when the pore size was much larger than the protein molecular diameter steinhauer et al 2015 4 conclusions time dependent in situ atr ftir spectroscopy was applied to elucidate the interaction between proteins and membranes in this work a multivariate methodology integrating mcr als and 2dcos analysis was developed to demonstrate the dynamic changes of the conformation of proteins on the pvdf surface mcr als analysis reveals a two step reaction process for both bsa and lys on the membrane surface and determines the transition points of the concentration profiles of the intermediates 2dcos was then used to discern the sequence order of conformational changes for each stage the hydrophobic membrane surface initially induced the unfolding of bsa and lys the expanded structure increased the number of contact sites between proteins and membrane surface as well as the exposed hydrophobic groups assisting the strong adsorption and the subsequent aggregation of proteins on the membrane surface the similar behaviors of bsa and lys on the pvdf membrane indicate that the membrane surface hydrophobicity played the dominant role in the protein induced membrane fouling process in addition the conformational transition process of bsa and lys was further confirmed by the afm and qcm d measurements this work provides comprehensive understanding of the entire membrane fouling process caused by proteins and sheds light on the interaction mechanism at a molecular level which could help the development of membrane anti fouling approaches moreover the approach integrating the mcr als and 2dcos analysis is proven to yield a detailed view of spectral transitions without a priori knowledge thus exhibits a great perspective for the elucidation of other complex interactions in environments declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

17738,n nitrosodimethylamine ndma as one emerging disinfection by product has been investigated globally since 1990s however its main precursors are still unclear we found that ndma formation potential ndmafp of various water samples increased firstly and then decreased gradually during incubation with microorganism we hypothesized that ndma precursors could be produced through metabolism of nitrogenous components and then gradually be biodegraded to verify this hypothesis six amino acids aas peptone and ammonium were separately incubated with microorganism and ndmafp was measured regularly the average molar yield of the substrates to ndmafp were 60 200 10 6 for the aas 350 10 6 for peptone under aerobic condition the extracellular fraction with molecular weight mw less than 1 k dalton contributed the majority to ndmafp in the peptone experiment followed by that with mw between 10 k and 0 22 μm and the intracellular materials dimethylamine and methylamine were detected during the experiments but their contribution to ndmafp is quite limited the results indicate that the nitrosamine precursors may not be the direct metabolite of aas or peptones but the excretion of living bacteria or the components in dead bacteria body our results inferred that aa metabolism may give an ndmafp of 0 12 nmol l maximum or 0 09 nmol l average in water under aerobic condition this estimation of ndmafp from aa metabolism can account for 38 maximum or 27 average of the median ndmafp in waters of china 0 32 nmol l reported before graphical abstract image 1 keywords n nitrosamines n nitrosodimethylamine ndma precursor metabolism amino acids formation 1 introduction several kinds of n nitrosamines particularly n nitrosodimethylamine ndma are strongly carcinogenic disinfection by products dbps these nitrosamine dbps can be formed during the reactions between their precursors and certain disinfectants particularly chloramines choi and valentine 2002 mitch and sedlak 2002 they have been found globally in drinking water or wastewater treatment plants asami et al 2009 bei et al 2016a charrois et al 2007 krasner et al 2013 najm and trussell 2001 templeton and chen 2010 regulations for nitrosamines have therefore been established in many countries e g australia and canada and specific regions e g ontario in canada california in the u s and shanghai in china kristiana et al 2012 the two basic strategies to restrain n nitrosamine formation in drinking water include removing precursors before disinfection and alternative disinfection rather than chloramination schreiber and mitch 2005 krasner et al 2013 li et al 2018 the combination of conventional and ozone biologically active carbon bac processes has been widely applied in drinking water treatment to enhance the removal of dissolved organic matter and dbp precursors liao et al 2015b however in some cases bacteria and soluble microbiological products from the biofilter constituted a source of ndma precursors liu et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 the tailored control of nitrosamines relies on the precise identification of nitrosamine precursors however the chemicals contributing to nitrosamine precursors in aquatic environment are in large number but generally in small concentration thus it is very challenging for researchers to identify the predominant precursors dozens of nitrosamine precursors have been identified until now these include secondary amines choi and valentine 2002 mitch and sedlak 2002 water treatment coagulants such as polydadmac padhye et al 2011 pharmaceutical and personal care products hanigan et al 2015 le roux et al 2011 shen and andrews 2011 pesticides bei et al 2016b le roux et al 2011 schmidt and brauch 2008 organic matter in wastewater treatment

al 2003 wastewater treatment plant effluents have been assumed to be the main sources of nitrosamine precursors to downstream water treatment plants dotson et al 2009 sgroi et al 2018 zeng et al 2016a however the specific chemicals as predominant nitrosamine precursors in wastewater treatment plant effluents have not been identified in china there is currently a particular concern with ndma and other nitrosamines due to the high concentration and high occurrence in drinking water bei et al 2016a ndma formation potential ndmafp test is applied to assess the maximum amount of ndma yield with sufficient monochloramine and long contact time mitch et al 2003 the ndmafp for source water samples from china were in range of 0 757 ng l and with the median of 24 ng l 0 32 nmol l bei et al 2016a which is higher than that reported in u s about 10 80 ng l chen and westerhoff 2010 about 12 84 ng l uzun et al 2015 about 0 40 ng l zeng et al 2016a and in australia about 2 22 ng l linge et al 2017 however the ndma precursors that have so far been identified e g some pharmaceuticals zhang et al 2015 have generally been found at only ng l level in water samples which could only explain a small fraction of the determined ndmafp few water treatment plants in china apply polydadmac or other quaternary ammonium flocculants this observation suggests that the main source of ndma precursors in china have not been well understood amino acids aas including free aas faas peptides and proteins are among the most important and abundant nitrogenous organic matters in aquatic environment they are originated from industrial and domestic wastewater effluents and aquatic microorganisms algae and bacteria some researchers reported negligible contribution to nitrosamine precursors from microorganism or its nitrogen containing constituents and aas mitch and sedlak 2004 however previous studies have mainly been focused on aas proteins or microorganism plasma in pristine states i e unaffected by biological or physical degradation processes in fact nitrogenous matters are important substrates for microorganism they will be involved in complex biochemical reactions such as hydrolysis decarboxylation deamination under natural condition and will be transformed into amines and other chemicals we therefore hypothesized that microorganisms metabolize nitrogenous substrates including ammonium faas peptides and proteins to form some products as nitrosamine precursors bei et al 2015 chen 2017 the main objective of this study was to test the hypothesis described by investigating the ndmafp dynamics during the biological metabolism experiments of individual aas ammonium chloride and peptone 2 materials and methods 2 1 water samples surface water samples a b and c

at 30 0 1 c to match the water temperature in summer and to fasten the biochemical reaction process triplicate tests were performed for each aliquot during incubation the microorganisms naturally

without autoclaving pretreatment presented large dynamic of ndmafp as sample a b or c the autoclaved sample presented quite stable level of ndmafp during incubation once the autoclaved sample was inoculated with microorganism the similar large dynamic can be observed also the results confirm that the dynamic of ndmafp of water samples during incubation is brought by the native or inoculated

6 polarity rapid assessment method and ultrafiltration for molecular weight distribution the polarity rapid assessment method was used to determine the polarities and charges of the ndma precursors produced during the incubation tests to narrow the scope of ndma precursor identification the ultrafiltration method was used to separate the organic matter in incubation samples into different fractions of 10 k dalton to 0 22 μm 5 10 k dalton 1 5 k dalton and less than 1 k dalton both procedures followed that described in previous studies chen et al 2014 liao et al 2015a rosario ortiz et al 2007 then the ndmafp and other properties of different fractions were determined more details are given in si 3 results and discussion 3 1 ndmafp of water samples during the incubation tests 3 1 1 ndmafp dynamic of real water samples the nitrosamine fp for each sample during incubation in the presence of native bacteria was determined the ndmafp generally contributed over 90 of the na8fp in the remainder we will focus on ndma and its precursors the change of ndmafp with incubation time in three water samples followed the similar profile increasing firstly and then decreasing during the incubation period as shown in fig 1 the difference of dynamic curves between samples were the time to get peak and its maximum and final residual concentration the ndmafp presented as high as 2 6 3 2 7 9 times increase during incubation of three samples there is still some ndmafp remained until the end of incubation indicating that the residual ndma precursors were recalcitrant to microbial metabolism the quick increase of ndmafp in the first days indicated some ndma precursor could be formed during microbial reactions the following decrease indicated these newly generated precursors were transformable the formation process was more dominant at the beginning of the incubation period and the biodegradation process was more dominant later both processes built the shape of ndmafp dynamic curves shown in fig 1 the influence of biological activities on ndma precursors was also reported by zeng and mitch 2016b they observed the elevation of ndma total n nitrosamine and other dbp concentrations in water undergoing nitrification and suggested that the precursors were released from nitrifying biofilms both investigations suggested that microorganisms play important roles in nitrosamine precursor formation 3 1 2 influence of aerobic or anaerobic condition the results of incubation experiments under aerobic or anaerobic condition for samples a b and c were shown in fig 2 generally the ndmafp first increased and then decreased both under aerobic or anaerobic condition but the profile of ndmafp curves were different for the different samples the ndmafp curves for sample a under aerobic or anaerobic condition had similar shape increasing for the first 2 d reaching maxima and then decreasing the peak concentration of ndmafp under anaerobic condition was 12 3 higher than that under aerobic condition marginally significant p 0 09 t test the ndmafp decreased more rapidly under anaerobic condition than under aerobic condition the ndmafp of sample a became relatively stable at 126 ng l after 6 d under anaerobic condition but decreased gradually and reached 85 ng l at 14 d the ndmafp of sample b varied in different ways under aerobic or under anaerobic condition the ndmafp of sample c had two maxima both under aerobic and anaerobic condition unlike sample a but similar to sample b the results proven that ndma precursors could be formed and biodegraded under both aerobic condition and anaerobic condition 3 1 3 polarity of the ndma precursors during incubation the polarity rapid assessment method results indicated that fractionation by either the c18 presenting non polar property or scx cartridge presenting positive charged property followed similar trends to the total ndmafp trend as shown in fig s1 in si the scx cartridge fractionation results presented similar trend to that of ndmafp the linear coefficient r2 between the ndmafp of scx fractionation and that for whole sample a or c under aerobic condition was 0 99 or 0 98 respectively that under anaerobic condition was 0 92 or 0 99 respectively the r2 value for the linear relationships between the ndmafp of c18 fractionation and that for whole samples a and c under aerobic condition was 0 49 or 0 99 respectively that under anaerobic condition was 0 88 or 0 94 respectively sample b was not assessed using the polarity rapid assessment method these results indicated that most of the nitrosamine precursors formed during incubation have positively charged functional groups and non polar moiety which agreed with the nitrosamine precursor structures presented by chen et al 2014 3 1 4 faa dynamics during incubation aas are the common nitrogenous chemicals existing in natural water and many present positively charged property this property matches the aforementioned results of polarity rapid assessment method thus we performed the targeted analyses of 18 common faas in sample b and c during the incubation period the results were shown in fig 3 several faas were detected in sample b including serine glutamic acid valine and proline with concentrations of 61 33 26 and 20 nmol l respectively those detected in sample c were even higher and the glutamic acid aspartic acid and alanine concentrations were 532 109 and 106 nmol l respectively these faa concentrations were several to dozens of times higher than those reported in previous studies in china liu et al 2016 and in u s dotson and westerhoff 2009 the total faa concentration decreased to a similar degree when samples was incubated for 9 d under either aerobic or anaerobic condition the concentrations of many aas decreased strongly but the glutamic acid concentration remained steadily we suggested that faas could be released as the hydrolysis products of proteins and peptides at the beginning and then biodegraded more easily than other don species during incubation however no strong linear relationship was found between the total faa concentration and ndmafp the faa concentrations in sample b and c were 59 76 and 63 79 lower respectively after the incubation period than at the start meanwhile the don concentrations in samples b and c were 57 58 and only 9 16 lower respectively data not shown we concluded that faas were more easily biodegraded than other don species during the incubation period concentrations of both ndmafp and faa changed drastically and slightly synchronously although they were not correlated linearly which inspire us to further explore their possible connections 3 2 nitrosamine precursor formation via nitrogenous chemical metabolism 3 2 1 nitrosamine formation potential of faas through chloramination nitrosamine fp of 19 kinds of faas was determined by one coauthor and included in his ph d dissertation wang 2012 and the detailed results are shown in table s12 in si it indicates that almost every aa contributes negligible amounts of nitrosamine precursors only a few aas e g glutamic acid and glutamine can react with monochloramine to produce detectable nitrosamine concentrations in water mitch and sedlak have detected molar yields for a model protein 8 1 10 6 for albumin a model aa 3 0 10 6 for histidine bacteria cell walls 86 10 6 for gram negative and 5 4 10 6 for gram positive and nitrogen containing constituents in model bacteria 0 40 10 6 for e coli and 0 36 10 6 for g amarae mitch and sedlak 2004 in our tests the ndmafp of histidine under chloramination was 0 14 10 6 i e lower than the detection limit which agreed with the results of the previous study 3 2 2 ndmafp dynamics during microbial faa metabolism microbial metabolism of faas gave fairly high ndmafp even though the aas were not direct precursors of ndma the ndmafp during microbial metabolism of alanine arginine hydroxyproline phenylalanine tryptophan or tyrosine is shown in fig 4 the ndmafp was dominant and contributed 91 of the sum of fp of eight nitrosamines low formation potentials of n nitrosomethylethylamine n nitrosopiperidine n nitrosomorpholine n nitrosodi n propylamine and n nitrosodi n butylamine were also detected only the ndmafp is therefore discussed below the maximum molar proportions for the transformation were calculated by the yield of largest increase of ndmafp over the initial concentration of substrate those of alanine arginine hydroxyproline phenylalanine tryptophan or tyrosine were 60 10 6 140 10 6 70 10 6 150 10 6 80 10 6 and 200 10 6 respectively these molar yields are 2 3 orders higher than the pristine aas mentioned in section 3 2 1 the ndmafp dynamics vary with different aas metabolism the ndmafp during metabolism of alanine increased gradually for 5 d of incubation that of hydroxyproline increased until the fifth day of incubation that of tyrosine increased quickly to 20 8 nmol l after 1 d of incubation but then decreased to a low level which was probably caused by a nutrient deficiency the initial toc concentration was 10 8 mg l but only 1 6 mg l was left after 5 d of incubation that of phenylalanine and tryptophan increased gradually for 9 d of incubation that of arginine first increased and then decreased on the last day of incubation the different ndmafp trends during metabolism for the different faas indicated that the metabolic pathways were complex 3 2 3 ndmafp dynamics during microbial ammonia metabolism ndma precursors were also detected during the spiked bacteria incubation with ammonium as the only nitrogen source and sodium acetate as the only carbon source as shown in table 1 ndmafp increased gradually as bacteria concentration increased during the 7 day incubation both extracellular matter and intracellular matter contributed importantly to ndmafp their curves have fairly high linear relationship with the bacteria concentration r bei et al 2015 0 77 r2 0 67 and ammonia consumption r bei et al 2015 0 67 r2 0 71 the results also verified that microbial metabolism of inorganic nitrogen also lead to ndma precursors formation the total transmission of ndmafp upon initial ammonia concentration was 9 10 6 which is about one order less than those of aforementioned six faas 3 2 4 ndmafp during microbial peptone metabolism according to literature faas contributed only small proportions of the total organic nitrogen matter in real water samples duan and bianchi 2007 combined and particular aas are more abundant peptone was rich in faas peptides combined aas and proteins particulate aas we therefore performed incubation tests using peptone as the only source of nitrogen and carbon under aerobic condition and anaerobic condition the results are shown in fig 5 for 9 days of incubation ndma precursors were the dominant nitrosamine precursors contributing 84 95 of the na8fp under aerobic condition and 71 97 of the na8fp under anaerobic condition the molar proportion for conversion of peptone into ndmafp during several days metabolism when reaching the maximum yield was 350 10 6 based on the initial molar concentration of don under aerobic condition and 110 10 6 under anaerobic condition these proportions were in little higher range of those for the individual aas 60 200 10 6 the ndmafp increased gradually for 9 days of incubation under aerobic condition but reached a plateau after 5 days of incubation under anaerobic condition the total faa concentration at the beginning of incubation test was 3000 nmol l which accounted for only 3 of the total don concentration the faas were depleted quickly within 1 or 2 d while other chemicals contributing don were depleted slower than faa don decreased to less than 0 1 mg l on day 9 under either aerobic or anaerobic condition according to general pathway of protein biodegradation peptides and proteins in the peptone were first hydrolyzed to give faas and then quickly metabolized the molar conversion proportion was higher for the peptone metabolism than for six of the faas under aerobic condition this phenomenon indicated that the presence of multiple don compounds in the peptone may have caused more microorganism metabolism to occur than when single faa was present 3 2 5 comparison of ndmafp formation between different nitrogen substrates the results confirmed that nitrosamine precursors mainly ndma precursors could be formed through the metabolism of faas peptone or ammonium by microorganisms we compared the bacteria count ndmafp and the ndmafp yield over bacteria count as concluded in fig 6 according to fig 6a peptone favored the proliferation of bacteria faster and in higher amount under aerobic condition than that under anaerobic condition and various aas except for arginine the bacteria count reached the peak amount of 10 2 106 cfu ml by 0 1 mmol l of peptone as tn the results indicated peptone have multiple substrates to better support the bacteria living the reason for higher bacteria amount with arginine as substrate during day 7 to day 9 is that arginine molecule contains four nitrogen atoms which can give more nitrogen substrate under the same molar concentration as other aas generally only limited bacteria growth with aas was observed during the first 3 days it indicated the individual aa as sole substrate is not sufficient for bacteria to reproduce quickly each aa was firstly transformed into other substrates by the inoculated bacteria for further breeding then the delay of bacteria curve could be observed we only conducted the 24 days incubation of alanine as well as peptone the long term performance of alanine to nourish bacteria and to be transformed into ndmafp is comparable to that of peptone under anaerobic condition meanwhile the ndmafp with peptone under aerobic condition also generally took the lead ndmafp with peptone as substrate under aerobic condition increased gradually to reach the peak of 29 5 nmol l on day 20 the peak concentration of ndmafp with peptone under anaerobic condition happened on day 7 and the peak amount 12 5 nmol l is less than 50 of that under aerobic condition meanwhile the normalized yield ndmafp over bacteria count of different substrates was concluded in fig 6c the high normalized yield was observed at the beginning and the end of incubation at the beginning small amount of bacteria was reproduced while fairly high concentration of ndmafp was produced it means the transformation of aas into other microbial substrates leads to ndma precursors as the bacteria count reached the peak the normalized yield decreased to the bottom during the declining period the normalized yield increased greatly which suggested that ndma precursors generated from the dead bacteria or intracellular fraction 3 3 preliminary study on mechanism of ndma precursor formation during nitrogenous chemical metabolism 3 3 1 molecular weight distribution of ndma precursors during microbial metabolism the molecular weight mw distribution of ndma precursors presented as ndmafp formed during metabolism of peptone and alanine was investigated to help understand the mechanism as shown in fig 7 the results showed the extracellular fraction with mw less than 1 k dalton contributed the majority to ndmafp followed by that with mw between 10 k and 0 22 μm and the intracellular materials for the peptone metabolism test under aerobic or anaerobic condition the fraction with mw less than 1 k dalton almost always took the highest percentage of ndmafp during the 9 days assay the range of percentage was 43 74 and the average was 61 under aerobic condition the contribution under anaerobic condition was in the range of 48 74 and the average was 66 the fraction with mw between 10 k and 0 22 μm took the second highest percentage of ndmafp with the average percentage of 24 under aerobic condition and the 17 under anaerobic condition besides the two extracellular fractions the intracellular matter contributed the third to ndmafp this fraction contributed slightly after 1 day incubation reached the peak percentage of 24 during 5 7 days and decreased to 5 after 9 days under aerobic condition the whole concentration of ndmafp presented the similar trend with the previous experiment shown in fig 5 although the pace to reach the peak was slower than the previous one the concentration of ndmafp reached 95 156 nmol l on day 14 to day 22 then decreased to 127 nmol l on day 24 data was shown in fig 8 similar mw distribution of ndmafp was also observed during the metabolism of alanine the fraction with mw less than 1 k dalton took the majority of ndmafp with the range of 52 80 and the average percentage of 66 the intracellular matter took the second highest percentage of ndmafp with the range of 8 30 and the average percentage of 20 the fraction with mw between 10 k and 0 22 μm contributed the third highest of ndmafp the whole ndmafp followed the similar trend with the previous experiment shown in fig 4 3 3 2 amine formation during microbial faa and peptone metabolism dimethylamine and methylamine were detected while diethylamine dibutylamine morpholine pyrrolidine was not detected during the experiments with peptone and alanine the concentration of dimethylamine fluctuated in the first 8 days and increased continuously during day 9 to day 24 the highest yield of dimethylamine was 145 nmol l during the aerobic metabolism of peptone the molar transmission ratio from dma to ndma was detected as 0 47 by us which is similar to 0 5 reported by mitch et al 2003 then the contribution of dma to ndmafp in this metabolism experiment is calculated as about 3 its maximum yields during the anaerobic metabolism of peptone and alanine were 79 and 82 nmol l respectively methylamine release was observed after 6 days incubation and fluctuated till day 24 there is no report that methylamine contribute to ndmafp since the contribution of dimethylamine to ndmafp was much smaller than the fraction with mw less than 1 k dalton further screening work is needed to identify the main ndma precursors 3 3 3 possible generation process of nitrosamine precursor dynamics during metabolism as well known in basic biochemistry faas peptone and ammonium are important nitrogen sources for bacteria these nitrogenous substrates are digested by bacteria and used to build proteins nuclei acids and other biomolecules inside the cell bacteria also excrete some enzymes to decompose some large substrates outside the cell and then transport the small products inside the cell the metabolism waste is discharged outside the cell which contributes to the extracellular soluble microbial products smps according to fig 7 the majority of ndmafp existed in extracellular smps especially in the fraction with mw less than 1 k dalton the ndmafp of this fraction increased continuously during 7 9 days experiments while that of the intracellular matter decreased as the bacteria count increased it indicated these precursors are possibly the metabolism waste or intracellular matter releasing ndmafp are also detected during the experiments with ammonium as the only nitrogen source although its yield was much lower than that of faas or peptone the results indicate that the nitrosamine precursors may not be the direct metabolite of faas or peptones but the excretion of living bacteria or the components in dead bacteria body dma is the only confirmed ndma precursors during the microbial metabolism by this investigation however its contribution to ndmafp was much smaller among the fraction with mw less than 1 k dalton further screening work needs to be conducted to identify the main ndma precursors a very recent publication zhang et al 2019 reported that aas themselves are the precursors of trihalomethanes haloacetonitriles and haloacetamides and biodegradation remarkably reduced the fp of these dbps differently our investigation showed the specialty of aa as quasi nitrosamine precursors and biodegradation can enhance the risk of nitrosamine formation during chloramination the problem may be serious if the buffer zone around the water intake of drinking water treatment plants is not sufficiently large in case of de facto water reuse a larger buffer zone or protection area is suggested to allow bacteria to effectively biodegrade rather than to transform aas into more nitrosamine precursors 3 4 potential contribution of aa metabolism to nitrosamine precursors in china waters the biological metabolism observed in our incubation experiments probably occur naturally in source water the ndma precursors existed in source water may be partly originated from aa metabolism then another objective of this study is to determine the potential contribution of biological metabolism of total aas to ndma precursors in real waters dominant nitrogenous organic matter in natural water includes faas combined aas peptides or proteins and particulate aas in cells and cell debris aa concentrations that have been found in natural water from different parts of china are shown in table s13 in si the individual faa concentrations were 1 1000 nmol l and the total aa concentrations were 5 4840 nmol l median 348 nmol l as described in section 3 2 4 the maximum and average molar proportions for the conversion of peptone containing a mixture of individual aas peptides and proteins into ndmafp under aerobic condition were 350 10 6 and 250 10 6 respectively then the maximum and average ndmafp caused by metabolism of aas peptides and proteins with median concentration in water under aerobic condition were estimated to be 0 12 nmol l 9 0 ng l and 0 09 nmol l 6 4 ng l respectively using the median ndmafp i e 24 ng l respectively for different parts of china as a benchmark bei et al 2016a the maximum and average potential contributions of aas peptides and proteins metabolism to ndmafp in source water are supposed to contribute 38 and 27 for ndmafp in water although this estimate can hardly be very accurate it can be concluded that the aas free combined and particulate aas existed in aquatic environment contribute greatly to nitrosamine precursors this may explain the high ndmafp that have been found in water in china surface water in china commonly receives domestic and industrial wastewater and is affected by eutrophication bei et al 2019 this is particularly the case for surface water in the yangtze river delta wang et al 2017 further research should be focused on determining the proportions of proteins peptides and aas in don in different water samples and investigating the mechanisms and pathways through which don species are metabolized this would allow more accurate estimates of the potential contributions of the metabolism of different don species to nitrosamine precursor concentrations to be made 4 conclusions and suggestions the following conclusions could be drawn from this investigation 1 it was found that ndmafp dynamic occurred with various water samples during incubation with microorganism this phenomenon initiated a hypothesis that ndma precursors could be produced through metabolism of nitrogenous components and then gradually be biodegraded 2 the results of incubation with six amino acids aas peptone and ammonium as the only nitrogen source verified this hypothesis the average molar yield of the substrates to ndmafp were 60 200 10 6 for the aas 350 10 6 and 110 10 6 for peptone under aerobic and anaerobic conditions 3 the extracellular fraction with mw less than 1 k dalton contributed the majority to ndmafp in the peptone experiment followed by that with mw between 10 k and 0 22 μm and the intracellular materials dimethylamine and methylamine were detected during the experiments but their contribution to ndmafp is quite limited the results indicate that the nitrosamine precursors may not be the direct metabolite of aas or peptones but the excretion of living bacteria or the components in dead bacteria body 4 our results inferred that aa metabolism may give an ndmafp of 0 12 nmol l maximum or 0 09 nmol l average in water under aerobic condition by multiplying the maximum or average molar yield of ndmafp and the median concentration of total aas in waters this estimation of ndmafp from aa metabolism can account for 38 maximum or 27 average of the median ndmafp in waters of china 0 32 nmol l reported before further work is needed to identify the components of nitrosamine precursors during the microbial metabolism process the

17738,n nitrosodimethylamine ndma as one emerging disinfection by product has been investigated globally since 1990s however its main precursors are still unclear we found that ndma formation potential ndmafp of various water samples increased firstly and then decreased gradually during incubation with microorganism we hypothesized that ndma precursors could be produced through metabolism of nitrogenous components and then gradually be biodegraded to verify this hypothesis six amino acids aas peptone and ammonium were separately incubated with microorganism and ndmafp was measured regularly the average molar yield of the substrates to ndmafp were 60 200 10 6 for the aas 350 10 6 for peptone under aerobic condition the extracellular fraction with molecular weight mw less than 1

regulations for nitrosamines have therefore been established in many countries e g australia and canada and specific regions e g ontario in canada california in the u s and shanghai in china kristiana et al 2012 the two basic strategies to restrain n nitrosamine formation in drinking water include removing precursors before disinfection and alternative disinfection rather than chloramination schreiber and mitch 2005 krasner et al 2013 li et al 2018 the combination of conventional and ozone biologically active carbon bac processes has been widely applied in drinking water treatment to enhance the removal of dissolved organic matter and dbp precursors liao et al 2015b however in some cases bacteria and soluble microbiological products from the biofilter constituted a source of ndma precursors liu et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 the tailored control of nitrosamines relies on the precise identification of nitrosamine precursors however the chemicals contributing to nitrosamine precursors in aquatic environment are in large number but generally in small concentration thus it is very challenging for researchers to identify the predominant precursors dozens of nitrosamine precursors have been identified until now these include secondary amines choi and valentine 2002 mitch and sedlak 2002 water treatment coagulants such as polydadmac padhye et al 2011 pharmaceutical

however the specific chemicals as predominant nitrosamine precursors in wastewater treatment plant effluents have not been identified in china there is currently a particular concern with ndma and other nitrosamines due to the high concentration and high occurrence in drinking water bei et al 2016a ndma formation potential ndmafp test is applied to assess the maximum amount of ndma yield with sufficient monochloramine and long contact time mitch et al 2003 the ndmafp for source water samples from china were in range of 0 757 ng l and with the median of 24 ng l 0 32 nmol l bei et al 2016a which is higher than that reported in u s about 10 80 ng l chen and westerhoff 2010 about 12 84 ng l uzun et al 2015 about 0 40 ng l zeng et al 2016a and in australia about 2 22 ng l linge et al 2017 however the ndma precursors that have so far been identified e g some pharmaceuticals zhang et al 2015 have generally been found at only ng l level in water samples which could only explain a small fraction of the determined ndmafp few water treatment plants in china apply polydadmac or other quaternary ammonium flocculants this observation suggests that the main source of ndma precursors in china have not been well understood amino acids aas including free aas faas peptides and proteins are among the most important and abundant nitrogenous organic matters in aquatic environment they are originated from industrial and domestic wastewater effluents and aquatic microorganisms algae and bacteria some researchers reported negligible contribution to nitrosamine precursors from microorganism or its nitrogen containing constituents and aas mitch and sedlak 2004 however previous studies have mainly been focused on aas proteins or microorganism plasma in pristine states i e unaffected by biological or physical degradation processes in fact nitrogenous matters are important substrates for microorganism they will be involved in complex biochemical reactions such as hydrolysis decarboxylation deamination under natural condition and will be transformed into amines and other chemicals we therefore hypothesized that microorganisms metabolize nitrogenous substrates including ammonium faas peptides and proteins to form some products as nitrosamine precursors bei et al 2015 chen 2017 the main objective of this study was to test the hypothesis described by investigating the ndmafp dynamics during the biological metabolism experiments of individual aas ammonium chloride and peptone 2 materials and methods 2 1 water samples surface water samples a b and c

6 polarity rapid assessment method and ultrafiltration for molecular weight distribution the polarity rapid assessment method was used to determine the polarities and charges of the ndma precursors produced during the incubation tests to narrow the scope of ndma precursor identification the ultrafiltration method was used to separate the organic matter in incubation samples into different fractions of 10 k dalton to 0 22 μm 5 10 k dalton 1 5 k dalton and less than 1 k dalton both procedures followed that described in previous studies chen et al 2014 liao et al 2015a rosario ortiz et al 2007 then the ndmafp and other properties of different fractions were determined more details are given in si 3 results and discussion 3 1 ndmafp of water samples during the incubation tests 3 1 1 ndmafp dynamic of real water samples the nitrosamine fp for each sample during incubation in the presence of native bacteria was determined the ndmafp generally contributed over 90 of the na8fp in the remainder we will focus on ndma and its precursors the change of ndmafp with incubation time in three water samples followed the similar profile increasing firstly and then decreasing during the incubation period as shown in fig 1 the difference of dynamic curves between samples were the time to get peak and its maximum and final residual concentration the ndmafp presented as high as 2 6 3 2 7 9 times increase during incubation of three samples there is still some ndmafp remained until the end of incubation indicating that the residual ndma precursors were recalcitrant to microbial metabolism the quick increase of ndmafp in the first days indicated some ndma precursor could be formed during microbial reactions the following decrease indicated these newly generated precursors were transformable the formation process was more dominant at the beginning of the incubation period and the biodegradation process was more dominant later both processes built the shape of ndmafp dynamic curves shown in fig 1 the influence of biological activities on ndma precursors was also reported by zeng and mitch 2016b they observed the elevation of ndma total n nitrosamine and other dbp concentrations in water undergoing nitrification and suggested that the precursors were released from nitrifying biofilms both investigations suggested that microorganisms play important roles in nitrosamine precursor formation 3 1 2 influence of aerobic or anaerobic condition the results of incubation experiments under aerobic or anaerobic condition for samples a b and c were shown in fig 2 generally the ndmafp first increased and then decreased both under aerobic or anaerobic condition but the profile of ndmafp curves were different for the different samples the ndmafp curves for sample a under aerobic or anaerobic condition had similar shape increasing for the first 2 d reaching maxima and then decreasing the peak concentration of ndmafp under anaerobic condition was 12 3 higher than that under aerobic condition marginally significant p 0 09 t test the ndmafp decreased more rapidly under anaerobic condition than under aerobic condition the ndmafp of sample a became relatively stable at 126 ng l after 6 d under anaerobic condition but decreased gradually and reached 85 ng l at 14 d the ndmafp of sample b varied in different ways under aerobic or under anaerobic condition the ndmafp of sample c had two maxima both under aerobic and anaerobic condition unlike sample a but similar to sample b the results proven that ndma precursors could be formed and biodegraded under both aerobic condition and anaerobic condition 3 1 3 polarity of the ndma precursors during incubation the polarity rapid assessment method results indicated that fractionation by either the c18 presenting non polar property or scx cartridge presenting positive charged property followed similar trends to the total ndmafp trend as shown in fig s1 in si the scx cartridge fractionation results presented similar trend to that of ndmafp the linear coefficient r2 between the ndmafp of scx fractionation and that for whole sample a or c under aerobic condition was 0 99 or 0 98 respectively that under anaerobic condition was 0 92 or 0 99 respectively the r2 value for the linear relationships between the ndmafp of c18 fractionation and that for whole samples a and c under aerobic condition was 0 49 or 0 99 respectively that under anaerobic condition was 0 88 or 0 94 respectively sample b was not assessed using the polarity rapid assessment method these results indicated that most of the nitrosamine precursors formed during incubation have positively charged functional groups and non polar moiety which agreed with the nitrosamine precursor structures presented by chen et al 2014 3 1 4 faa dynamics during incubation aas are the common nitrogenous chemicals existing in natural water and many present positively charged property this property matches the aforementioned results of polarity rapid assessment method thus we performed the targeted analyses of 18 common faas in sample b and c during the incubation period the results were shown in fig 3 several faas were detected in sample b including serine glutamic acid valine and proline with concentrations of 61 33 26 and 20 nmol l respectively those detected in sample c were even higher and the glutamic acid aspartic acid and alanine concentrations were 532 109 and 106 nmol l respectively these faa concentrations were several to dozens of times higher than those reported in previous studies in china liu et al 2016 and in u s dotson and westerhoff 2009 the total faa concentration decreased to a similar degree when samples was incubated for 9 d under either aerobic or anaerobic condition the concentrations of many aas decreased strongly but the glutamic acid concentration remained steadily we suggested that faas could be released as the hydrolysis products of proteins and peptides at the beginning and then biodegraded more easily than other don species during incubation however no strong linear relationship was found between the total faa concentration and ndmafp the faa concentrations in sample b and c were 59 76 and 63 79 lower respectively after the incubation period than at the start meanwhile the don concentrations in samples b and c were 57 58 and only 9 16 lower respectively data not shown we concluded that faas were more easily biodegraded than other don species during the incubation period concentrations of both ndmafp and faa changed drastically and slightly synchronously although they were not correlated linearly which inspire us to further explore their possible connections 3 2 nitrosamine precursor formation via nitrogenous chemical metabolism 3 2 1 nitrosamine formation potential of faas through chloramination nitrosamine fp of 19 kinds of faas was determined by one coauthor and included in his ph d dissertation wang 2012 and the detailed results are shown in table s12 in si it indicates that almost every aa contributes negligible amounts of nitrosamine precursors only a few aas e g glutamic acid and glutamine can react with monochloramine to produce detectable nitrosamine concentrations in water mitch and sedlak have detected molar yields for a model protein 8 1 10 6 for albumin a model aa 3 0 10 6 for histidine bacteria cell walls 86 10 6 for gram negative and 5 4 10 6 for gram positive and nitrogen containing constituents in model bacteria 0 40 10 6 for e coli and 0 36 10 6 for g amarae mitch and sedlak 2004 in our tests the ndmafp of histidine under chloramination was 0 14 10 6 i e lower than the detection limit which agreed with the results of the previous study 3 2 2 ndmafp dynamics during microbial faa metabolism microbial metabolism of faas gave fairly high ndmafp even though the aas were not direct precursors of ndma the ndmafp during microbial metabolism of alanine arginine hydroxyproline phenylalanine tryptophan or tyrosine is shown in fig 4 the ndmafp was dominant and contributed 91 of the sum of fp of eight nitrosamines low formation potentials of n nitrosomethylethylamine n nitrosopiperidine n nitrosomorpholine n nitrosodi n propylamine and n nitrosodi n butylamine were also detected only the ndmafp is therefore discussed below the maximum molar proportions for the transformation were calculated by the yield of largest increase of ndmafp over the initial concentration of substrate those of alanine arginine hydroxyproline phenylalanine tryptophan or tyrosine were 60 10 6 140 10 6 70 10 6 150 10 6 80 10 6 and 200 10 6 respectively these molar yields are 2 3 orders higher than the pristine aas mentioned in section 3 2 1 the ndmafp dynamics vary with different aas metabolism the ndmafp during metabolism of alanine increased gradually for 5 d of incubation that of hydroxyproline increased until the fifth day of incubation that of tyrosine increased quickly to 20 8 nmol l after 1 d of incubation but then decreased to a low level which was probably caused by a nutrient deficiency the initial toc concentration was 10 8 mg l but only 1 6 mg l was left after 5 d of incubation that of phenylalanine and tryptophan increased gradually for 9 d of incubation that of arginine first increased and then decreased on the last day of incubation the different ndmafp trends during metabolism for the different faas indicated that the metabolic pathways were complex 3 2 3 ndmafp dynamics during microbial ammonia metabolism ndma precursors were also detected during the spiked bacteria incubation with ammonium as the only nitrogen source and sodium acetate as the only carbon source as shown in table 1 ndmafp increased gradually as bacteria concentration increased during the 7 day incubation both extracellular matter and intracellular matter contributed importantly to ndmafp their curves have fairly high linear relationship with the bacteria concentration r bei et al 2015 0 77 r2 0 67 and ammonia consumption r bei et al 2015 0 67 r2 0 71 the results also verified that microbial metabolism of inorganic nitrogen also lead to ndma precursors formation the total transmission of ndmafp upon initial ammonia concentration was 9 10 6 which is about one order less than those of aforementioned six faas 3 2 4 ndmafp during microbial peptone metabolism according to literature faas contributed only small proportions of the total organic nitrogen matter in real water samples duan and bianchi 2007 combined and particular aas are more abundant peptone was rich in faas peptides combined aas and proteins particulate aas we therefore performed incubation tests using peptone as the only source of nitrogen and carbon under aerobic condition and anaerobic condition the results are shown in fig 5 for 9 days of incubation ndma precursors were the dominant nitrosamine precursors contributing 84 95 of the na8fp under aerobic condition and 71 97 of the na8fp under anaerobic condition the molar proportion for conversion of peptone into ndmafp during several days metabolism when reaching the maximum yield was 350 10 6 based on the initial molar concentration of don under aerobic condition and 110 10 6 under anaerobic condition these proportions were in little higher range of those for the individual aas 60 200 10 6 the ndmafp increased gradually for 9 days of incubation under aerobic condition but reached a plateau after 5 days of incubation under anaerobic condition the total faa concentration at the beginning of incubation test was 3000 nmol l which accounted for only 3 of the total don concentration the faas were depleted quickly within 1 or 2 d while other chemicals contributing don were depleted slower than faa don decreased to less than 0 1 mg l on day 9 under either aerobic or anaerobic condition according to general pathway of protein biodegradation peptides and proteins in the peptone were first hydrolyzed to give faas and then quickly metabolized the molar conversion proportion was higher for the peptone metabolism than for six of the faas under aerobic condition this phenomenon indicated that the presence of multiple don compounds in the peptone may have caused more microorganism metabolism to occur than when single faa was present 3 2 5 comparison of ndmafp formation between different nitrogen substrates the results confirmed that nitrosamine precursors mainly ndma precursors could be formed through the metabolism of faas peptone or ammonium by microorganisms we compared the bacteria count ndmafp and the ndmafp yield over bacteria count as concluded in fig 6 according to fig 6a peptone favored the proliferation of bacteria faster and in higher amount under aerobic condition than that under anaerobic condition and various aas except for arginine the bacteria count reached the peak amount of 10 2 106 cfu ml by 0 1 mmol l of peptone as tn the results indicated peptone have multiple substrates to better support the bacteria living the reason for higher bacteria amount with arginine as substrate during day 7 to day 9 is that arginine molecule contains four nitrogen atoms which can give more nitrogen substrate under the same molar concentration as other aas generally only limited bacteria growth with aas was observed during the first 3 days it indicated the individual aa as sole substrate is not sufficient for bacteria to reproduce quickly each aa was firstly transformed into other substrates by the inoculated bacteria for further breeding then the delay of bacteria curve could be observed we only conducted the 24 days incubation of alanine as well as peptone the long term performance of alanine to nourish bacteria and to be transformed into ndmafp is comparable to that of peptone under anaerobic condition meanwhile the ndmafp with peptone under aerobic condition also generally took the lead ndmafp with peptone as substrate under aerobic condition increased gradually to reach the peak of 29 5 nmol l on day 20 the peak concentration of ndmafp with peptone under anaerobic condition happened on day 7 and the peak amount 12 5 nmol l is less than 50 of that under aerobic condition meanwhile the normalized yield ndmafp over bacteria count of different substrates was concluded in fig 6c the high normalized yield was observed at the beginning and the end of incubation at the beginning small amount of bacteria was reproduced while fairly high concentration of ndmafp was produced it means the transformation of aas into other microbial substrates leads to ndma precursors as the bacteria count reached the peak the normalized yield decreased to the bottom during the declining period the normalized yield increased greatly which suggested that ndma precursors generated from the dead bacteria or intracellular fraction 3 3 preliminary study on mechanism of ndma precursor formation during nitrogenous chemical metabolism 3 3 1 molecular weight distribution of ndma precursors during microbial metabolism the molecular weight mw distribution of ndma precursors presented as ndmafp formed during metabolism of peptone and alanine was investigated to help understand the mechanism as shown in fig 7 the results showed the extracellular fraction with mw less than 1 k dalton contributed the majority to ndmafp followed by that with mw between 10 k and 0 22 μm and the intracellular materials for the peptone metabolism test under aerobic or anaerobic condition the fraction with mw less than 1 k dalton almost always took the highest percentage of ndmafp during the 9 days assay the range of percentage was 43 74 and the average was 61 under aerobic condition the contribution under anaerobic condition was in the range of 48 74 and the average was 66 the fraction with mw between 10 k and 0 22 μm took the second highest percentage of ndmafp with the average percentage of 24 under aerobic condition and the 17 under anaerobic condition besides the two extracellular fractions the intracellular matter contributed the third to ndmafp this fraction contributed slightly after 1 day incubation reached the peak percentage of 24 during 5 7 days and decreased to 5 after 9 days under aerobic condition the whole concentration of ndmafp presented the similar trend with the previous experiment shown in fig 5 although the pace to reach the peak was slower than the previous one the concentration of ndmafp reached 95 156 nmol l on day 14 to day 22 then decreased to 127 nmol l on day 24 data was shown in fig 8 similar mw distribution of ndmafp was also observed during the metabolism of alanine the fraction with mw less than 1 k dalton took the majority of ndmafp with the range of 52 80 and the average percentage of 66 the intracellular matter took the second highest percentage of ndmafp with the range of 8 30 and the average percentage of 20 the fraction with mw between 10 k and 0 22 μm contributed the third highest of ndmafp the whole ndmafp followed the similar trend with the previous experiment shown in fig 4 3 3 2 amine formation during microbial faa and peptone metabolism dimethylamine and methylamine were detected while diethylamine dibutylamine morpholine pyrrolidine was not detected during the experiments with peptone and alanine the concentration of dimethylamine fluctuated in the first 8 days and increased continuously during day 9 to day 24 the highest yield of dimethylamine was 145 nmol l during the aerobic metabolism of peptone the molar transmission ratio from dma to ndma was detected as 0 47 by us which is similar to 0 5 reported by mitch et al 2003 then the contribution of dma to ndmafp in this metabolism experiment is calculated as about 3 its maximum yields during the anaerobic metabolism of peptone and alanine were 79 and 82 nmol l respectively methylamine release was observed after 6 days incubation and fluctuated till day 24 there is no report that methylamine contribute to ndmafp since the contribution of dimethylamine to ndmafp was much smaller than the fraction with mw less than 1 k dalton further screening work is needed to identify the main ndma precursors 3 3 3 possible generation process of nitrosamine precursor dynamics during metabolism as well known in basic biochemistry faas peptone and ammonium are important nitrogen sources for bacteria these nitrogenous substrates are digested by bacteria and used to build proteins nuclei acids and other biomolecules inside the cell bacteria also excrete some enzymes to decompose some large substrates outside the cell and then transport the small products inside the cell the metabolism waste is discharged outside the cell which contributes to the extracellular soluble microbial products smps according to fig 7 the majority of ndmafp existed in extracellular smps especially in the fraction with mw less than 1 k dalton the ndmafp of this fraction increased continuously during 7 9 days experiments while that of the intracellular matter decreased as the bacteria count increased it indicated these precursors are possibly the metabolism waste or intracellular matter releasing ndmafp are also detected during the experiments with ammonium as the only nitrogen source although its yield was much lower than that of faas or peptone the results indicate that the nitrosamine precursors may not be the direct metabolite of faas or peptones but the excretion of living bacteria or the components in dead bacteria body dma is the only confirmed ndma precursors during the microbial metabolism by this investigation however its contribution to ndmafp was much smaller among the fraction with mw less than 1 k dalton further screening work needs to be conducted to identify the main ndma precursors a very recent publication zhang et al 2019 reported that aas themselves are the precursors of trihalomethanes haloacetonitriles and haloacetamides and biodegradation remarkably reduced the fp of these dbps differently our investigation showed the specialty of aa as quasi nitrosamine precursors and biodegradation can enhance the risk of nitrosamine formation during chloramination the problem may be serious if the buffer zone around the water intake of drinking water treatment plants is not sufficiently large in case of de facto water reuse a larger buffer zone or protection area is suggested to allow bacteria to effectively biodegrade rather than to transform aas into more nitrosamine precursors 3 4 potential contribution of aa metabolism to nitrosamine precursors in china waters the biological metabolism observed in our incubation experiments probably occur naturally in source water the ndma precursors existed in source water may be partly originated from aa metabolism then another objective of this study is to determine the potential contribution of biological metabolism of total aas to ndma precursors in real waters dominant nitrogenous organic matter in natural water includes faas combined aas peptides or proteins and particulate aas in cells and cell debris aa concentrations that have been found in natural water from different parts of china are shown in table s13 in si the individual faa concentrations were 1 1000 nmol l and the total aa concentrations were 5 4840 nmol l median 348 nmol l as described in section 3 2 4 the maximum and average molar proportions for the conversion of peptone containing a mixture of individual aas peptides and proteins into ndmafp under aerobic condition were 350 10 6 and 250 10 6 respectively then the maximum and average ndmafp caused by metabolism of aas peptides and proteins with median concentration in water under aerobic condition were estimated to be 0 12 nmol l 9 0 ng l and 0 09 nmol l 6 4 ng l respectively using the median ndmafp i e 24 ng l respectively for different parts of china as a benchmark bei et al 2016a the maximum and average potential contributions of aas peptides and proteins metabolism to ndmafp in source water are supposed to contribute 38 and 27 for ndmafp in water although this estimate can hardly be very accurate it can be concluded that the aas free combined and particulate aas existed in aquatic environment contribute greatly to nitrosamine precursors this may explain the high ndmafp that have been found in water in china surface water in china commonly receives domestic and industrial wastewater and is affected by eutrophication bei et al 2019 this is particularly the case for surface water in the yangtze river delta wang et al 2017 further research should be focused on determining the proportions of proteins peptides and aas in don in different water samples and investigating the mechanisms and pathways through which don species are metabolized this would allow more accurate estimates of the potential contributions of the metabolism of different don species to nitrosamine precursor concentrations to be made 4 conclusions and suggestions the following conclusions could be drawn from this investigation 1 it was found that ndmafp dynamic occurred with various water samples during incubation with microorganism this phenomenon initiated a hypothesis that ndma precursors could be produced through metabolism of nitrogenous components and then gradually be biodegraded 2 the results of incubation with six amino acids aas peptone and ammonium as the only nitrogen source verified this hypothesis the average molar yield of the substrates to ndmafp were 60 200 10 6 for the aas 350 10 6 and 110 10 6 for peptone under aerobic and anaerobic conditions 3 the extracellular fraction with mw less than 1 k dalton contributed the majority to ndmafp in the peptone experiment followed by that with mw between 10 k and 0 22 μm and the intracellular materials dimethylamine and methylamine were detected during the experiments but their contribution to ndmafp is quite limited the results indicate that the nitrosamine precursors may not be the direct metabolite of aas or peptones but the excretion of living bacteria or the components in dead bacteria body 4 our results inferred that aa metabolism may give an ndmafp of 0 12 nmol l maximum or 0 09 nmol l average in water under aerobic condition by multiplying the maximum or average molar yield of ndmafp and the median concentration of total aas in waters this estimation of ndmafp from aa metabolism can account for 38 maximum or 27 average of the median ndmafp in waters of china 0 32 nmol l reported before further work is needed to identify the components of nitrosamine precursors during the microbial metabolism process the

17739,selenate se vi contamination in groundwater is one of major concerns for human health in particular in shale gas extraction sites microbial selenate reduction coupled to methane ch4 oxidation has been demonstrated very recently little is known whether ethane c2h6 and butane c3h8 are able to drive selenate reduction although they are also important components in shale gas in this study we demonstrated se vi bio reduction could be achieved using c2h6 and c3h8 as electron donors and carbon sources scanning electron microscopy coupled to energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy sem edx confirmed elemental se se0 was the major final product formed from se vi bio reduction polyhydroxyalkanoates phas were generated in the biofilms as the internal electron storage materials which were consumed for sustaining se vi bio reduction in absence of c2h6 and c3h8 microbial community analysis showed that two genera capable of oxidizing gaseous alkanes dominated in the biofilms including mycobacterium in both c2h6 and c3h8 fed biofilms and rhodococcus in c3h8 fed biofilm in addition several potential se vi reducers e g variovorax were detected in the biofilms investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states analysis supported that predictive genes associated with alkanes oxidation denitrification and phas cycle were enriched in the biofilms these findings offer insights into the process of selenate reduction driven by c2h6 and c3h8 which ultimately may help to develop a solution to use shale gas for groundwater remediation especially near shale gas exploitation sites graphical abstract image 1 keywords ethane propane selenate groundwater remediation membrane biofilm reactor shale gas 1 introduction shale gas has attracted increasingly commercial interests and become economically recoverable over the last decades gregory et al 2011 it is globally estimated that shale gas reserves are up to 7 3 103 trillion ft3 u s eia et al 2013 the price of shale gas is decreasing continuously due to new horizontal drilling and efficient extraction technologies shale gas is composed of various saturated gaseous alkanes including methane ch4 ethane c2h6 and propane c3h8 ambrose et al 2011 jackson et al 2013 while shale gas contains ch4 as the primary component the amounts of c2h6 and c3h8 could reach up to 20 and 10 respectively in shale gas umukoro and ismail 2017 however accompanied with the exploitation shale gas is readily to migrate to surrounding water systems including drinking water jackson et al 2013 osborn et al 2011 groundwater llewellyn et al 2015 and surface water zeng et al 2013 for example 23 times higher c2h6 was detected in drinking water wells when marcellus shale gas was exploited jackson et al 2013 the leakage of shale gas has become a public concern because the contained gaseous alkanes were potent greenhouse gases and they may cause photochemical pollution etiope and ciccioli 2009 on the other hand the shales commonly contain selenium se up to 50 mg kg tourtelot 1962 the enrichment of se in the shales could be a big risk of se contamination to the surrounding water systems especially when shale gas is exploited which has been reported in cretaceous black shales in montana and barnett shales in texas usa mayland et al 1989 fontenot et al 2013 and bowland shales in the north of england parnell et al 2016 the concentration of dissolved se in water systems near drilled shales e g colorado shale in central montana could reach up to 1 mg l mayland et al 1989 however dissolved se in aquatic ecosystems is a critical concern because of its acute toxicity se can replace sulfur s in proteins reshape the structure of the proteins and damage their normal function lemly 1998 thus disturbing normal metabolisms of organisms there has been a serious se pollution incident in kesterson reservoir california where high level of se led to the deaths deformities and birth defects of a large number of waterfowls and fishes presser 1994 in addition se could also cause cancer cardiovascular disease diabetes and nervous disorder to human bodies sun et al 2014 the u s environmental protection agency epa has set the maximum contaminant level mcl of se at 50 μg se l usepa 2015 in particular selenate seo4 2 se vi in the shales with high toxicity and water solubility is usually formed by weathering tuttle et al 2014 zawislanski et al 2003 butler et al 1994 found se vi was the dominant se species 97 in groundwater samples from weathered mancos shale transformation of se vi to elemental selenium se0 is beneficial for lowering se toxicity and contamination since se0 formes as precipitates in aqueous phase thus can be easily removed se vi could be microbially reduced to se0 by phylogenetically diverse microorganisms specific selenate reducing bacteria e g thauera selenatis schroeder et al 1997 enterobacter cloacae sld1a 1 watts et al 2003 and sulfurospirillum barnesii watts et al 2005 are capable of reducing se vi to se iv using their periplasmic selenate reductases or membrane bound selenate reductase some nitrate reducers e g paracoccus pantotrophus and ralstonia eutropha could also carry out se vi reduction using their periplasmic nap or membrane bound nar nitrate reductases sabaty et al 2001 se iv could be further reduced to se0 by periplasmic nitrite reductase nir demoll decker macy 1993 or hydrogenase i yanke et al 1995 electron donors are required to drive microbial selenate reduction to date lactate lenz et al 2009 acetate navarro et al 2015 and hydrogen lai et al 2014 have been used as electron donor to reduce se vi very recently lai et al 2016 found se vi could be reduced to se0 using methane ch4 as the sole electron donor and carbon source they proposed methanotrophs could oxidized ch4 in which intermediates such as organic metabolites would be released and used by methanotrophs or other selenate reducing bacteria for converting se vi to se0 in another study luo et al 2018 reported se vi reduction could be mediated by nitrite nitrate dependent anaerobic methane oxidation microorganisms including candidatus methanoperedens and candidatus methylomirabilis in a ch4 based membrane biofilm reactor mbfr although microbial selenate reduction coupled to methane oxidation has been reported lai et al 2016 luo et al 2018 it is still unknown whether c2h6 and c3h8 are able to drive selenate reduction as electron donors it has been well known that c2h6 and c3h8 can be aerobically oxidized in a similar metabolic pathway of ch4 oxidation in which c2h6 and c3h8 can be oxidized into ethanol or propanol followed by conversion to aldehydes and acids shennan 2006 considering the highly positive redox potential of se vi se iv 440 mv and se iv se0 210 mv nancharaiah and lens 2015 doran 1982 and the negative redox potential of c2h6 270 mv and c3h8 277 mv rittmann and mccarty 2001 c2h6 or c3h8 coupled to se vi reduction is energetically feasible thus it is proposed that proper application of these c2h6 and c3h8 might be beneficial to develop solutions to utilize shale gas to eliminate selenate contamination in aquatic systems near shale gas exploitation sites in addition the application of shale gas as electron donor could be a preferred alternative for bio reduction of se vi since shale gas is much cheaper 0 08 1 00 m3 markets insider 2020 than pure ch4 1 34 m3 global petrol prices 2020 thus the objective of this study was to test the feasibility of se vi bio reduction using c2h6 and c3h8 in shale gas as the electron donors for proving the concept we set up two independent mbfrs in which non porous polypropylene fibers were used to deliver c2h6 or c3h8 directly to the biofilms attaching on the fiber walls by utilizing mbfr systems a high gaseous electron donor utilizing efficiency can be achieved e g 96 of methane utilization efficiency in cai et al 2018 thus minimizing the off gassing liu et al 2019 rittmann et al 2014 zhou et al 2019 both long term operation and batch tests were conducted to study se vi removal pattern with these two gaseous alkanes the dominant microorganisms involved in c2h6 or c3h8 oxidation and selenate reduction were analyzed by using high throughput 16s rrna gene sequencing in addition key functional genes involved in c2h6 c3h8 oxidation and selenate bio reduction were predicted by applying phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states picrust pipeline 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor setup and operation two laboratory scale mbfrs similar to that used by lai et al 2018a were set up in this study fig s1 briefly each reactor contained two glass tubes with total volume of 100 ml in which 96 composite hollow fibers model mhf 200tl mitsubishi ltd japan were installed with a total membrane surface area of 141 cm2 c2h6 or c3h8 was separately delivered into each mbfr at the fixed gas pressure of 10 psi 165 kpa controlled by gas pressure regulators coregas australia a peristaltic pump bt100 1l yz1515x longer pump china was employed to mix the bulk liquor at the rate of 80 ml min in order to trigger activation of c2h6 and c3h8 limited o2 was delivered at 150 mg l day through an oxygen permeable tube silicone tubing longerpump china both mbfrs were covered with silver papers to avoid alga growth and the reactor temperature was kept at 22 2 c initially each mbfr was inoculated with 20 ml of activated sludge from a full scale wastewater treatment plant brisbane australia the inoculated sludge was recirculated with the nitrogen degassed mineral medium containing 10 mg se l of se vi for 48 h in order to achieve biofilm attachment the composition of the mineral medium was 20 mg l nh4cl 20 1 mg l cacl2 5 mg l mgso4 7h2o 5 mg l mgcl 6h2o 0 2 mg l kah2po4 and 0 4 mg l na2hpo4 12h2o acid and alkaline trace element solution was also added into the mineral medium according to ettwig et al 2009 during the reactors operation for 105 days the influent with approximate se vi concentration of 1 mg se l was continuously fed into each reactor at the flow rate of 0 2 ml min influent and effluent samples were taken by a 5 ml syringe terumo japan every 3 days and immediately filtered through 0 22 μm membrane filters millex usa in a supplementary experiment a lower se vi concentration i e 0 2 mg se l was fed into the two mbfrs for mimicking environmentally relevant conditions 2 2 batch tests multiple batch tests were performed for each mbfr table s1 batch tests a c were conducted in situ mbfrs under oxygen limiting condition while batch test d were performed in serum bottles under strict anaerobic condition batch test a was carried out to determine the pattern of se vi reduction in the presence of c2h6 or c3h8 we introduced each mbfr with stock solution of se vi and made the final se vi concentration at 20 mg se l and delivered c2h6 c3h8 the same as long term operation batch test b was to evaluate whether se vi could be reduced without c2h6 or c3h8 before this test each mbfr was disconnected from gas cylinder to release pressured c2h6 c3h8 in the gas tubes then the fresh medium containing 20 mg se l was fed the medium into each reactor to remove dissolved c2h6 or c3h8 in liquid batch test c was carried out to confirm whether c2h6 or c3h8 was consumed along with bio reduction of se vi in each mbfr fresh medium containing 10 mg l of se vi was sparged with c2h6 or c3h8 for 20 min and was then introduced into the mbfrs to eliminate any headspace batch test d was conducted to study the dynamic change of se vi and c2h6 c3h8 under anaerobic condition mineral medium containing 20 mg l of se vi was added into serum bottles and biofilms attaching on the fibers of each mbfr were scrapped off and transferred into the bottles the serum bottles were flushed with n2 for 30 min sealed with butyl rubber stoppers and aluminum crimps and then c2h6 or c3h8 was injected into the serum bottles with gas tight syringes the serum bottles were covered with silver papers and the cultures were incubated at 22 2 c liquid samples of each batch test were collected regularly for determining total soluble se and se vi biomass samples were collected at the beginning and the end of batch test b for measuring polyhydroxyalkanoates phas for measuring dissolved c2h6 and c3h8 in batch test c liquid samples collected from each mbfr were quickly filtered into sealed vacuum tubes exetainer uk and then 100 μl gas tight syringe 1710 sl syr hamilton was used to sample headspace gas in the tubes and quickly injected into gc for measuring c2h6 and c3h8 in batch test d gas in the headspace of the serum bottles was withdrawn using a gas tight syringe and directly injected into gc each batch test was conducted for three times 2 3 chemical analysis we measured se vi concentration using an ion chromatography ic dionex ics 2100 usa with an ionpac as19 column total dissolved se se vi se iv was determined by an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes perkinelmer optima 7300dv after the liquid samples were centrifuged 15000 g 10 min for removing se0 precipitates se iv in the effluent was calculated based on the difference between total dissolved se and se vi and produced se0 was calculated by subtracting total soluble se in effluent from se vi in influent the ph level was monitored using a ph meter oakton australia and it was between 6 8 and 7 4 throughout the experiments a dissolved oxygen do meter oakton eutech instruments singapore was applied to measure the concentration of dissolved o2 in the mbfr systems do was measured regularly and it was under detection limit 0 01 mg l at steady state during long term operation and batch tests for all mbfrs gaseous c2h6 and c3h8 were analyzed by using a gas chromatography gc 7890a agilent technologies usa equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and a porapak q column phas were measure as described by zeng et al 2003 2 4 selenate reduction product identification and characterization we collected biomass attaching to se0 precipitates by sequential washing with deionized water 100 acetone as described by lai et al 2018b field emission scanning electron microscope fe sem jeol jsm 7001f usa equipped with a with a hot schottky electron gun was applied to characterize the

data procession by using qiime2 marcos et al 2019 reads quality was controlled using dada2 callahan et al 2016 and taxonomy was assigned by blasting based on non redundant silva databases 99 identity with default parameters moreover picrust pipeline was applied to predict the metagenomic compositions of the biofilms as described by langille et al langille et al 2013 lv et al 2020 2 6 half order kinetic model for selenate reduction the half order kinetic model is widely used for describing substances change in biofilms qambrani et al 2015 and it is fitted well to the dynamic change of se vi concentration se vi reduction was modelled by pseudo half order kinetics for batch tests a b by using software package aquasim the equation used in this study is as follows d c d t k c in which c is the concentrations of se vi and k is the half order reaction rate constant for se vi reduction 3 results 3 1 microbial se vi reduction using c2h6 and c3h8 as electron donors the performance of the two mbfrs supplied with c2h6 or c3h8 for reducing se vi was monitored for 105 days operation fig 1 the c2h6 based mbfr did not show any obvious se vi reduction within the first 20 days se vi was partially converted to se iv during day 21 30 se vi removal rate continuously increased up until day 42 in which almost all of se vi in influent was removed 99 along with the accumulation of se iv afterwards the effluent se iv concentration diminished until all of se iv was removed on day 54 suggesting all the se vi in influent was removed the se vi reduction profiles of c3h8 based mbfr were similar to that of c2h6 based mbfr however it took much shorter time for the c3h8 based mbfr to initiate se vi reduction within 12 days and achieve complete se vi removal within 21 days compared to c2h6 based mbfrs under steady state the selenate removal flux rates of both mbfrs reached 22 mg m 2 d 1 at the end of the operational period after day 80 selenate concentrations in both mbfrs were mostly below 0 02 mg l giving rise to a selenate removal efficiency of above 98 at the final period in addition the two mbfrs were able to achieve 100 se vi removal when feeding with se vi at a lower concentration 0 2 mg l fig s2 sem edx was applied to characterize the morphologies and elemental compositions of precipitates in both mbfrs fig 2 the co occurrence of nanospheres and microrods was observed in the c2h6 fed biofilm while only nanospheres were found in c3h8 fed biofilms the edx spectra targeting the nanospheres or microrods confirm se was the dominant element in the precipitates 3 2 dynamic changes of se species c2h6 c3h8 and phas in batch experiments four batch tests were carried out at the end of long term operation for each mbfr in batch test a when c2h6 or c3h8 was present the concentration of se vi of both mbfrs decreased continuously along with the increase of se0 fig 3 a b based on the half order kinetics model the c3h8 based mbfr had a significantly higher se vi removal rate k 0 29 mg se0 5l 0 5h 1 than that of c2h6 k 0 19 mg se0 5l 0 5h 1 p 0 01 fig 4 although se vi could still be reduced to se0 in both mbfrs without feeding with c2h6 or c3h8 in batch test b fig 3c d se vi removal rate was significantly lower than that in batch test a p 0 01 fig 4 evidenced from a significantly lower reaction rate constant k 0 10 mg se0 5l 0 5h 1 and 0 14 mg se0 5l 0 5h 1 for c2h6 and c3h8 based mbfr respectively phas contents in the inoculum and biofilms for both mbfrs were measured to test if phas played as an internal carbon source for selenate reduction in batch test b the results showed that no phas were detected in the inoculum while phas at the levels of 3 4 0 1 and 5 8 0 3 of biomass dry weight were observed at the beginning of batch test b for c2h6 and c3h8 based mbfr respectively fig s3 however phas contents decreased sharply to 0 8 0 1 and 1 4 0 4 of biomass dry weight at the end of this batch respectively indicating the role of phas in absence of c2h6 or c3h8 for batch c fed with c2h6 c3h8 and selenate under oxygen limiting condition the average oxidation rates of c2h6 and c3h8 were calculated to be 2 9 and 2 0 mg l d and se vi reduction rate was 0 8 and 1 3 mg l d respectively fig 5 a b however oxidation rates of c2h6 c3h8 became less than 0 1 mg l d and se vi reduction rate decreased to be less than 0 2 mg l d in batch test d under anaerobic conditions fig 5c d these results suggested that the supply of limited oxygen played an important role in selenate reduction driven by c2h6 c3h8 3 3 microbial community structure and key functional genes in the biofilms we explored the shift of microbial communities from the inoculum to the shaped biofilms day 55 and day 100 by using illumina sequencing targeting 16s rrna gene fig 6 the microbial community structure had large discrepancy among mbfrs with different gaseous alkanes but were very similar in the same mbfr at different sampling time day 55 and day 100 at class level β proteobacteria dominated the inoculum being about 26 of the total phylotypes but it disappeared in all biofilm samples in addition actinobacteria was obviously enriched in the biofilms with the relative abundances of 20 47 of total microorganisms although was very minor in the inoculum 0 3 fig 6a at genus level the abundances of mycobacterium and rhodococcus were negligible in the inoculum but became important in the biofilm samples fig 6b mycobacterium dominated both c2h6 and c3h8 fed biofilms 18 26 while rhodococcus was only enriched in the c3h8 fed biofilms 19 genera affiliated to burkholderiaceae were absent in the inoculum but were also enriched in all biofilm samples 5 14 in addition c2h6 fed biofilms were harboured with tahibacter 2 4 and hyphomicrobium 5 while all biofilms supported the growth of variovorax 1 3 and ferruginibacter 1 4 the picrust pipline was further applied to reveal dynamic changes of predictive genes involved in alkanes oxidation se vi reduction and phas cycle the predictive gene related to alkane monooxygenase which is the key enzyme for c2h6 c3h8 activation was minor in the inoculum 0 6 but it was obviously enriched in the biofilms 2 2 3 6 fig s4 similarly the predictive gene associated with alcohol dehydrogenase the enzyme oxidizes alcohols to aldehydes was much higher in the biofilms than that in the inoculum the abundances of genes involved in nitrate reductases potential enzymes for se vi bio reduction sabaty et al 2001 and nitrite reductase potential enzymes for se iv reduction demoll decker 1993 also increased in the biofilms compared to the inoculum moreover predictive genes related to phas cycle polyhydroxybutyrate depolymerase 3 hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase and acetoacetyl coa synthetase were enriched in the biofilms lai et al 2018a 4 discussion 4 1 mechanisms for microbial se vi reduction driven by c2h6 and c3h8 this study demonstrated that se vi could be microbially converted into elemental selenium by using c2h6 or c3h8 as the sole electron donor the complete se vi removal during long term operation fig 1 together with the simultaneous c2h6 c3h8 consumption and se vi reduction in batch test c fig 5 collectively suggest that these gaseous alkanes are driving factors for se vi bio reduction sem edx confirmed se0 was the final product of se vi reduction in the biofilms indicating biological se vi reduction was the main mechanism for se vi removal rather than se vi absorption based on the fact of the con current se vi reduction and phas degradation at absence of c2h6 c3h8 in batch test b phas likely played a role in microbial se vi reduction it seems that the biofilms synthesized phas when fed with c2h6 c3h8 jaewook et al 2018 verlinden et al 2007 while the generated phas were consumed for supporting se vi bio reduction when gaseous electron donor was absent it has been reported that phas could serve as a slow releasing electron donor for driving reductive dichlorination aulenta et al 2008 during the bio process phas could be enzymatically hydrolysed to 3 hydroxybutyric acid that is further transformed to butyrate through beta oxidation butyrate could then be converted to hydrogen h2 and acetate both are versatile electron donors for driving bio reduction of se vi aulenta et al 2008 the enrichment of predictive genes involved in phas cycle in the biofilms indicates c2h6 and c3h8 fed biofilms harboured the biological functions for phas synthesis and degradation fig 6 it should be noted that further studies are needed to experimentally elucidate how c2h6 and c3h8 are converted into phas the high throughput 16s rrna gene sequencing was employed to identify potential players involved in alkanes oxidation and selenate reduction in terms of their relative abundances mycobacterium was significantly enriched in both c2h6 and c3h8 fed biofilms while rhodococcus became predominant only in c3h8 fed biofilms many strains affiliated to mycobacterium and rhodococcus were reported to be able to grow on non methane short chain gaseous alkanes scgas shennan 2006 for example mycobacterium strain nbb4 contains various of monooxygenases for alkanes oxidation and catabolic enzymes related to alkanes assimilation giving its capability to grow on multiple hydrocarbon substrates coleman et al 2011 rhodococcus ruber iegm 231 a strain isolated from the site near an oil extracting enterprise could oxidize c3h8 ivshina et al 2014 in addition two genera affiliated to burkholderiaceae have been reported to oxidize hydrocarbon toluene lünsmann et al 2016 the enrichment of these microorganisms in the biofilms indicates their potential roles in oxidizing c2h6 c3h8 based on these enriched aerobic microorganisms and no obvious c2h6 and c3h8 consumption was observed under anaerobic condition in batch test d we can conclude that aerobic oxidation of c2h6 and c3h8 should be the key mechanism to activate these gaseous alkanes theoretically by using c2h6 c3h8 monooxygenases c2h6 c3h8 oxidizing microorganisms are capable of incorporating one atom of o2 into the carbon hydrogen bonds of these gaseous alkanes thus catalyzing the oxidation of c2h6 and c3h8 to ethanol or propanol respectively shennan 2006 alcohols dehydrogenases then catalyze these alcohols into acetaldehyde propionaldehyde which are further oxidized to acetate propionate by aldehydes dehydrogenase and the produced acids could ultimately be oxidized to co2 during the oxidation processes electrons could be released the enrichment of predictive genes associated with alkane monooxygenases and alcohol dehydrogenases by picrust analysis support the key role of these aerobic alkanes oxidizing bacteria for c2h6 and c3h8 activation moreover hyphomicrobium variovorax tahibacter and ferruginibacter were enriched in the biofilms many species affiliated to these genera are well known denitrifiers kloos et al 1995 im et al 2010 wu et al 2019 or involved in denitrification metabolisms xia et al 2019 it has been documented that denitrifiers are potential selenate reducers since several membrane bounding and periplasmic nitrate reductases are capable of reducing se vi sabaty et al 2001 the increased abundance of predictive genes related to nitrate reductases in the biofilms further indicates nitrate reductases might have carried out se vi reduction in the c2h6 c3h8 fed biofilms in addition the much higher abundance of predictive genes related to nitrite reductases in the biofilms than that in the inoculum indicates nitrite reductases might contribute to further reduction of se iv to se0 nitrite reductase in thauera selenatis has been reported to be involved in se iv reduction demoll decker et al 1993 therefore the enrichment of these denitrifiers in the biofilms suggest they may have performed se vi and se iv bio reduction through nitrate reductases and nitrite reductases respectively using the released electrons from aerobic oxidation of c2h6 or c3h8 based on microbial community structure in the biofilms it seems that the synergy between two functional groups alkanes oxidizing bacteria and se vi reducers carried out c2h6 c3h8 oxidation and se vi bio reduction in a cross feeding pattern it is similar to the archaea bacteria consortia reported by chen et al 2019 and laso pérez et al 2016 in which archaea performed anaerobic ethane butane oxidation and sulfate reducing bacteria carried out so4 2 reduction however since a few alkanes oxidizing bacteria e g mycobacterium and rhodococcus could have the denitrification capability chen et al 2012 angeby et al 2002 we cannot exclude the possibility that mycobacterium and rhodococcus independently performed simultaneous se vi reduction and c2h6 c3h8 oxidation further studies are required to elucidate and verify microbial mechanisms of se vi bio reduction driven by c2h6 and c3h8 through more advanced molecular technologies e g isotopic experiments and various meta omics 4 2 implications of this study in addition to methane reported in previous studies lai et al 2016 luo et al 2018 this study demonstrated it is potential to use c2h6 and c3h8 contained in shale gas to reduce se vi the c2h6 and c3h8 supported se vi removal rate in this study could reach up to 1 mg se l h based on batch test a which is even higher than the obtained rates in h2 and ch4 based mbfrs 0 3 0 5 mg se l h in previous studies lai et al 2014 2016 the two systems were also effective to remove environmentally relevant selenate concentration 0 2 mg se l implying their capability to treat se vi under practical conditions mayland et al 1989 in this study the mbfr configuration was employed for delivering c2h6 and c3h8 due to its high gas utilizing efficiency thus minimizing potential greenhouse gas leakage thus the proposed process is more suitable for ex situ removing se vi from contaminated groundwater rather than in situ remediation in fact the co existence of shale gas and se has been found in many shale gas exploitation sites balaba and smart 2012 parnell et al 2016 massive of se embedded in the shales readily migrates into groundwater via leaching of rock waste and subsurface leaching especially when shale gas is being exploited stillings and amacher 2010 us de 2011 thus imposing a serious threat to aquatic ecosystems previous studies reported that both c2h6 and c3h8 can be utilized to remove organic pollutants e g trichloroethylene tce and n nitrosodimethylamine ndma for example hashimoto et al 2002 reported the cometabolic degradation of tce and trichloroethane tca by c2h6 utilizing microorganism mycobacterium sp ta27 recently hatzinger lippincott et al 2019 demonstrated in situ ndma degradation by sparging air and c3h8 directly into an ndma contaminated aquifer therefore it is potential to utilize the gaseous electron donors ch4 c2h6 and c3h8 for the development of in situ technology to remediate se or organic contaminants from groundwater near shale gas exploitation sites it should be noted that further studies are required to test the real shale gas consisting of all ch4 c2h6 and c3h8 and calculate the contribution from each composition in addition the wide distribution of non methane scgas e g shales oceans sediments soils gasoline spills sewage sludges and anaerobic digestors etiope and ciccioli 2009 shennan 2006 and se e g shales soils earth crust minerals agricultural irrigation mining and se related industries johnson et al 1999 letey 2002 shah et al 2008 gives many potential opportunities for their intersection therefore this study also indicate se vi bio reduction coupled to c2h6 c3h8 oxidation might contribute to an important role in geochemical cycling of shale gas based carbon and se 5 conclusions in this study we demonstrated se vi bio reduction using c2h6 or c3h8 as electron donors and carbon sources the major reduction product was se0 nanospheres phas were synthesized in the biofilms in presence of c2h6 or c3h8 while they would be degraded for supporting se vi reduction when these gaseous alkanes were absent mycobacterium seems to play a role in oxidizing c2h6 while rhodococcus was likely involved in oxidizing c3h8 in addition it seems that some se vi reducers e g variovorax carried out se vi reduction these findings offer insights into the application of shale gas for microbial reduction of selenate thus supporting the development of cost effective solutions for groundwater remediation further studies are required to elucidate and verify microbial

17739,selenate se vi contamination in groundwater is one of major concerns for human health in particular in shale gas extraction sites microbial selenate reduction coupled to methane ch4 oxidation has been demonstrated very recently little is known whether ethane c2h6 and butane c3h8 are able to drive selenate reduction although they are also important components in shale gas in this study we demonstrated se vi bio reduction could be achieved using c2h6 and c3h8 as electron donors and carbon sources scanning electron microscopy coupled to energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy sem edx confirmed elemental se se0 was the major final product formed from se vi bio reduction polyhydroxyalkanoates phas were generated in the biofilms as the internal electron storage materials which were consumed for sustaining se vi bio reduction in absence of c2h6 and c3h8 microbial community analysis showed that two genera capable of oxidizing gaseous alkanes dominated in the biofilms including mycobacterium in both c2h6 and c3h8 fed biofilms and rhodococcus in c3h8 fed biofilm in addition several potential se vi reducers e g variovorax were detected in the biofilms investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states analysis supported that predictive genes associated with alkanes oxidation denitrification and phas cycle were enriched in the biofilms these findings offer insights into the process of selenate reduction driven by c2h6 and c3h8 which ultimately may help to develop a solution to use shale gas for groundwater remediation especially near shale gas exploitation sites graphical abstract image 1 keywords ethane propane selenate groundwater remediation membrane biofilm reactor shale gas 1 introduction shale gas has attracted increasingly commercial interests and become economically recoverable over the last decades gregory et al 2011 it is globally estimated that shale gas reserves are up to 7 3 103 trillion ft3 u s eia et al 2013 the price of shale gas is decreasing continuously due to new horizontal drilling and efficient extraction technologies shale gas is composed of various saturated gaseous alkanes including methane ch4 ethane c2h6 and propane c3h8 ambrose et al 2011 jackson et al 2013 while shale gas contains ch4 as the primary component the amounts of c2h6 and c3h8 could reach up to 20 and 10 respectively in shale gas umukoro and ismail 2017 however accompanied with the exploitation shale gas is readily to migrate to surrounding water systems including drinking water jackson et al 2013 osborn et al 2011 groundwater llewellyn et al 2015 and surface water zeng et al 2013 for example 23 times higher c2h6 was detected in drinking water wells when marcellus shale gas was exploited jackson et al 2013 the leakage of shale gas has become a public concern because the contained gaseous alkanes were potent greenhouse gases and they may cause photochemical pollution etiope and ciccioli 2009 on the other hand the shales commonly contain selenium se up to 50 mg kg tourtelot 1962 the enrichment of se in the shales could be a big risk of se contamination to the surrounding water systems especially when shale gas is exploited which has been reported in cretaceous black shales in montana and barnett shales in texas usa mayland et al 1989 fontenot et al 2013 and bowland shales in the north of england parnell et al 2016 the concentration of dissolved se in water systems near drilled shales e g colorado shale in central montana could reach up to 1 mg l mayland et al 1989 however dissolved se in aquatic ecosystems is a critical concern because of its acute toxicity se can replace sulfur s in proteins reshape the structure of the proteins and damage their normal function lemly 1998 thus disturbing normal metabolisms of organisms there has been a serious se pollution incident in kesterson reservoir california where high level of se led to the deaths deformities and birth defects of a large number of waterfowls and fishes presser 1994 in addition se could also cause cancer cardiovascular disease diabetes and nervous disorder to human bodies sun et al 2014 the u s environmental protection agency epa has set the maximum contaminant level mcl of se at 50 μg se l usepa 2015 in particular selenate seo4 2 se vi in the shales with high toxicity and water solubility is usually formed by weathering tuttle et al 2014 zawislanski et al 2003 butler et al 1994 found se vi was the dominant se species 97 in groundwater samples from weathered mancos shale transformation of se vi to elemental selenium se0 is beneficial for lowering se toxicity and contamination since se0 formes as precipitates in aqueous phase thus can be easily removed se vi could be microbially reduced to se0 by phylogenetically diverse microorganisms specific selenate reducing bacteria e g thauera selenatis schroeder et al 1997 enterobacter cloacae sld1a 1 watts et al 2003 and sulfurospirillum barnesii watts et al 2005 are capable of reducing se vi to se iv using their periplasmic selenate reductases or membrane bound selenate reductase some nitrate reducers e g paracoccus pantotrophus and ralstonia eutropha could also carry out se vi reduction using their periplasmic nap or membrane bound nar nitrate reductases sabaty et al 2001 se iv could be further reduced to se0 by periplasmic nitrite reductase nir demoll decker macy 1993 or hydrogenase i yanke et al 1995 electron donors are required to drive microbial selenate reduction to date lactate lenz et al 2009 acetate navarro et al 2015 and hydrogen lai et al 2014 have been used as electron donor to reduce se vi very recently lai et al 2016 found se vi could be reduced to se0 using methane ch4 as the sole electron donor and carbon source they proposed methanotrophs could oxidized ch4 in which intermediates such as organic metabolites would be released and used by methanotrophs or other selenate reducing bacteria for converting se vi to se0 in another study luo et al 2018 reported se vi reduction could be mediated by nitrite nitrate dependent anaerobic methane oxidation microorganisms including candidatus methanoperedens and candidatus methylomirabilis in a ch4 based membrane biofilm reactor mbfr although microbial selenate reduction coupled to methane oxidation has been reported lai et al 2016 luo et al 2018 it is still unknown whether c2h6 and c3h8 are able to drive selenate reduction as electron donors it has been well known that c2h6 and c3h8 can be aerobically oxidized in a similar metabolic pathway of ch4 oxidation in which c2h6 and c3h8 can be oxidized into ethanol or propanol followed by conversion to aldehydes and acids shennan 2006 considering the highly positive redox potential of se vi se iv 440 mv and se iv se0 210 mv nancharaiah and lens 2015 doran 1982 and the negative redox potential of c2h6 270 mv and c3h8 277 mv rittmann and mccarty 2001 c2h6 or c3h8 coupled to se vi reduction is energetically feasible thus it is proposed that proper application of these c2h6 and c3h8 might be beneficial to develop solutions to utilize shale gas to eliminate selenate contamination in aquatic systems near shale gas exploitation sites in addition the application of shale gas as electron donor could be a preferred alternative for bio reduction of se vi since shale gas is much cheaper 0 08 1 00 m3 markets insider 2020 than pure ch4 1 34 m3 global petrol prices 2020 thus the objective of this study was to test the feasibility of se vi bio reduction using c2h6 and c3h8 in shale gas as the electron donors for proving the concept we set up two independent mbfrs in which non porous polypropylene fibers were used to deliver c2h6 or c3h8 directly to the biofilms attaching on the fiber walls by utilizing mbfr systems a high gaseous electron donor utilizing efficiency can be achieved e g 96 of methane utilization efficiency in cai et al 2018 thus minimizing the off gassing liu et al 2019 rittmann et al 2014 zhou et al 2019 both long term operation and batch tests were conducted to study se vi removal pattern with these two gaseous alkanes the dominant microorganisms involved in c2h6 or c3h8 oxidation and selenate reduction were analyzed by using high throughput 16s rrna gene sequencing in addition key functional genes involved in c2h6 c3h8 oxidation and selenate bio reduction were predicted by applying phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states picrust pipeline 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor setup and operation two laboratory scale mbfrs similar to that used by lai et al 2018a were set up in this study fig s1 briefly each reactor contained two glass tubes with total volume of 100 ml in which 96 composite hollow fibers model mhf 200tl mitsubishi ltd japan were installed with a total membrane surface area of 141 cm2 c2h6 or c3h8 was separately delivered into each mbfr at the fixed gas pressure of 10 psi 165 kpa controlled by gas pressure regulators coregas australia a peristaltic pump bt100 1l yz1515x longer pump china was employed to mix the bulk liquor at the rate of 80 ml min in order to trigger activation of c2h6 and c3h8 limited o2 was delivered at 150 mg l day through an oxygen permeable tube silicone tubing longerpump china both mbfrs were covered with silver papers to avoid alga growth and the reactor temperature was kept at 22 2 c initially each mbfr was inoculated with 20 ml of activated sludge from a full scale wastewater treatment plant brisbane australia the inoculated sludge was recirculated with the nitrogen degassed mineral medium containing 10 mg se l of se vi for 48 h in order to achieve biofilm attachment the composition of the mineral medium was 20 mg l nh4cl 20 1 mg l cacl2 5 mg l mgso4 7h2o 5 mg l mgcl 6h2o 0 2 mg l kah2po4 and 0 4 mg l na2hpo4 12h2o acid and alkaline trace element solution was also added into the mineral medium according to ettwig et al 2009 during the reactors operation for 105 days the influent with approximate se vi concentration of 1 mg se l was continuously fed into each reactor at the flow rate of 0 2 ml min influent and effluent samples were taken by a 5 ml syringe terumo japan every 3 days and immediately filtered through 0 22 μm membrane filters millex usa in a supplementary experiment a lower se vi concentration i e 0 2 mg se l was fed into the two mbfrs for mimicking environmentally relevant conditions 2 2 batch tests multiple batch tests were performed for each mbfr table s1 batch tests a c were conducted in situ mbfrs under oxygen limiting condition while batch test d were performed in serum bottles under strict anaerobic condition batch test a was carried out to determine the pattern of se vi reduction in the presence of c2h6 or c3h8 we introduced each mbfr with stock solution of se vi and made the final se vi concentration at 20 mg se l and delivered c2h6 c3h8 the same as long term operation batch test b was to evaluate whether se vi could be reduced without c2h6 or c3h8 before this test each mbfr was disconnected from gas cylinder to release pressured c2h6 c3h8 in the gas tubes then the fresh medium containing 20 mg se l was fed the medium into each reactor to remove dissolved c2h6 or c3h8 in liquid batch test c was carried out to confirm whether c2h6 or c3h8 was consumed along with bio reduction of se vi in each mbfr fresh medium containing 10 mg l of se vi was sparged with c2h6 or c3h8 for 20 min and was then introduced into the mbfrs to eliminate any headspace batch test d was conducted to study the dynamic change of se vi and c2h6 c3h8 under anaerobic condition mineral medium containing 20 mg l of se vi was added into serum bottles and biofilms attaching on the fibers of each mbfr were scrapped off and transferred into the bottles the serum bottles were flushed with n2 for 30 min sealed with butyl rubber stoppers and aluminum crimps and then c2h6 or c3h8 was injected into the serum bottles with gas tight syringes the serum bottles were covered with silver papers and the cultures were incubated at 22 2 c liquid samples of each batch test were collected regularly for determining total soluble se and se vi biomass samples were collected at the beginning and the end of batch test b for measuring polyhydroxyalkanoates phas for measuring dissolved c2h6 and c3h8 in batch test c liquid samples collected from each mbfr were quickly filtered into sealed vacuum tubes exetainer uk and then 100 μl gas tight syringe 1710 sl syr hamilton was used to sample headspace gas in the tubes and quickly injected into gc for measuring c2h6 and c3h8 in batch test d gas in the headspace of the serum bottles was withdrawn using a gas tight syringe and directly injected into gc each batch test was conducted for three times 2 3 chemical analysis we measured se vi concentration using an ion chromatography ic dionex ics 2100 usa with an ionpac as19 column total dissolved se se vi se iv was determined by an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes perkinelmer optima 7300dv after the liquid samples were centrifuged 15000 g 10 min for removing se0 precipitates se iv in the effluent was calculated based on the difference between total dissolved se and se vi and produced se0 was calculated by subtracting total soluble se in effluent from se vi in influent the ph level was monitored using a ph meter oakton australia and it was between 6 8 and 7 4 throughout the experiments a dissolved oxygen do meter oakton eutech instruments singapore was applied to measure the concentration of dissolved o2 in the mbfr systems do was measured regularly and it was under detection limit 0 01 mg l at steady state during long term operation and batch tests for all mbfrs gaseous c2h6 and c3h8 were analyzed by using a gas chromatography gc 7890a agilent technologies usa equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and a porapak q column phas were measure as described by zeng et al 2003 2 4 selenate reduction product identification and characterization we collected biomass attaching to se0 precipitates by sequential washing with deionized water 100 acetone as described by lai et al 2018b field emission scanning electron microscope fe sem jeol jsm 7001f usa equipped with a with a hot schottky electron gun was applied to characterize the morphology of precipitates in the biofilms the spot areas were identified by backscattered electron image bse and scanned by energy dispersive x ray analysis edx to analyze elemental compositions of

amplicons were purified by agencourt ampure xp beads beckman coulter and indexed with barcodes and sequenced on miseq sequencing system illumina in australian centre for ecogenomics ace we performed data procession by using qiime2 marcos et al 2019 reads quality was controlled using dada2 callahan et al 2016 and taxonomy was assigned by blasting based on non redundant silva databases 99 identity with default parameters moreover picrust pipeline was applied to predict the metagenomic compositions of the biofilms as described by langille et al langille et al 2013 lv et al 2020 2 6 half order kinetic model for selenate reduction the half order kinetic model is widely used for describing substances change in biofilms qambrani et al 2015 and it is fitted well to the dynamic change of se vi concentration se vi reduction was modelled by pseudo half order kinetics for batch tests a b by using software package aquasim the equation used in this study is as follows d c d t k c in which c is the concentrations of se vi and k is the half order reaction rate constant for se vi reduction 3 results 3 1 microbial se vi reduction using c2h6 and c3h8 as electron donors the performance of the two mbfrs supplied with c2h6 or c3h8 for reducing se vi was monitored for 105 days operation fig 1 the c2h6 based mbfr did not show any obvious se vi reduction within the first 20 days se vi was partially converted to se iv during day 21 30 se vi removal rate continuously increased up until day 42 in which almost all of se vi in influent was removed 99 along with the accumulation of se iv afterwards the effluent se iv concentration diminished until all of se iv was removed on day 54 suggesting all the se vi in influent was removed the se vi reduction profiles of c3h8 based mbfr were similar to that of c2h6 based mbfr however it took much shorter time for the c3h8 based mbfr to initiate se vi reduction within 12 days and achieve complete se vi removal within 21 days compared to c2h6 based mbfrs under steady state the selenate removal flux rates of both mbfrs reached 22 mg m 2 d 1 at the end of the operational period after day 80 selenate concentrations in both mbfrs were mostly below 0 02 mg l giving rise to a selenate removal efficiency of above 98 at the final period in addition the two mbfrs were able to achieve 100 se vi removal when feeding with se vi at a lower concentration 0 2 mg l fig s2 sem edx was applied to characterize the morphologies and elemental compositions of precipitates in both mbfrs fig 2 the co occurrence of nanospheres and microrods was observed in the c2h6 fed biofilm while only nanospheres were found in c3h8 fed biofilms the edx spectra targeting the nanospheres or microrods confirm se was the dominant element in the precipitates 3 2 dynamic changes of se species c2h6 c3h8 and phas in batch experiments four batch tests were carried out at the end of long term operation for each mbfr in batch test a when c2h6 or c3h8 was present the concentration of se vi of both mbfrs decreased continuously along with the increase of se0 fig 3 a b based on the half order kinetics model the c3h8 based mbfr had a significantly higher se vi removal rate k 0 29 mg se0 5l 0 5h 1 than that of c2h6 k 0 19 mg se0 5l 0 5h 1 p 0 01 fig 4 although se vi could still be reduced to se0 in both mbfrs without feeding with c2h6 or c3h8 in batch test b fig 3c d se vi removal rate was significantly lower than that in batch test a p 0 01 fig 4 evidenced from a significantly lower reaction rate constant k 0 10 mg se0 5l 0 5h 1 and 0 14 mg se0 5l 0 5h 1 for c2h6 and c3h8 based mbfr respectively phas contents in the inoculum and biofilms for both mbfrs were measured to test if phas played as an internal carbon source for selenate reduction in batch test b the results showed that no phas were detected in the inoculum while phas at the levels of 3 4 0 1 and 5 8 0 3 of biomass dry weight were observed at the beginning of batch test b for c2h6 and c3h8 based mbfr respectively fig s3 however phas contents decreased sharply to 0 8 0 1 and 1 4 0 4 of biomass dry weight at the end of this batch respectively indicating the role of phas in absence of c2h6 or c3h8 for batch c fed with c2h6 c3h8 and selenate under oxygen limiting condition the average oxidation rates of c2h6 and c3h8 were calculated to be 2 9 and 2 0 mg l d and se vi reduction rate was 0 8 and 1 3 mg l d respectively fig 5 a b however oxidation rates of c2h6 c3h8 became less than 0 1 mg l d and se vi reduction rate decreased to be less than 0 2 mg l d in batch test d under anaerobic conditions fig 5c d these results suggested that the supply of limited oxygen played an important role in selenate reduction driven by c2h6 c3h8 3 3 microbial community structure and key functional genes in the biofilms we explored the shift of microbial communities from the inoculum to the shaped biofilms day 55 and day 100 by using illumina sequencing targeting 16s rrna gene fig 6 the microbial community structure had large discrepancy among mbfrs with different gaseous alkanes but were very similar in the same mbfr at different sampling time day 55 and day 100 at class level β proteobacteria dominated the inoculum being about 26 of the total phylotypes but it disappeared in all biofilm samples in addition actinobacteria was obviously enriched in the biofilms with the relative abundances of 20 47 of total microorganisms although was very minor in the inoculum 0 3 fig 6a at genus level the abundances of mycobacterium and rhodococcus were negligible in the inoculum but became important in the biofilm samples fig 6b mycobacterium dominated both c2h6 and c3h8 fed biofilms 18 26 while rhodococcus was only enriched in the c3h8 fed biofilms 19 genera affiliated to burkholderiaceae were absent in the inoculum but were also enriched in all biofilm samples 5 14 in addition c2h6 fed biofilms were harboured with tahibacter 2 4 and hyphomicrobium 5 while all biofilms supported the growth of variovorax 1 3 and ferruginibacter 1 4 the picrust pipline was further applied to reveal dynamic changes of predictive genes involved in alkanes oxidation se vi reduction and phas cycle the predictive gene related to alkane monooxygenase which is the key enzyme for c2h6 c3h8 activation was minor in the inoculum 0 6 but it was obviously enriched in the biofilms 2 2 3 6 fig s4 similarly the predictive gene associated with alcohol dehydrogenase the enzyme oxidizes alcohols to aldehydes was much higher in the biofilms than that in the inoculum the abundances of genes involved in nitrate reductases potential enzymes for se vi bio reduction sabaty et al 2001 and nitrite reductase potential enzymes for se iv reduction demoll decker 1993 also increased in the biofilms compared to the inoculum moreover predictive genes related to phas cycle polyhydroxybutyrate depolymerase 3 hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase and acetoacetyl coa synthetase were enriched in the biofilms lai et al 2018a 4 discussion 4 1 mechanisms for microbial se vi reduction driven by c2h6 and c3h8 this study demonstrated that se vi could be microbially converted into elemental selenium by using c2h6 or c3h8 as the sole electron donor the complete se vi removal during long term operation fig 1 together with the simultaneous c2h6 c3h8 consumption and se vi reduction in batch test c fig 5 collectively suggest that these gaseous alkanes are driving factors for se vi bio reduction sem edx confirmed se0 was the final product of se vi reduction in the biofilms indicating biological se vi reduction was the main mechanism for se vi removal rather than se vi absorption based on the fact of the con current se vi reduction and phas degradation at absence of c2h6 c3h8 in batch test b phas likely played a role in microbial se vi reduction it seems that the biofilms synthesized phas when fed with c2h6 c3h8 jaewook et al 2018 verlinden et al 2007 while the generated phas were consumed for supporting se vi bio reduction when gaseous electron donor was absent it has been reported that phas could serve as a slow releasing electron donor for driving reductive dichlorination aulenta et al 2008 during the bio process phas could be enzymatically hydrolysed to 3 hydroxybutyric acid that is further transformed to butyrate through beta oxidation butyrate could then be converted to hydrogen h2 and acetate both are versatile electron donors for driving bio reduction of se vi aulenta et al 2008 the enrichment of predictive genes involved in phas cycle in the biofilms indicates c2h6 and c3h8 fed biofilms harboured the biological functions for phas synthesis and degradation fig 6 it should be noted that further studies are needed to experimentally elucidate how c2h6 and c3h8 are converted into phas the high throughput 16s rrna gene sequencing was employed to identify potential players involved in alkanes oxidation and selenate reduction in terms of their relative abundances mycobacterium was significantly enriched in both c2h6 and c3h8 fed biofilms while rhodococcus became predominant only in c3h8 fed biofilms many strains affiliated to mycobacterium and rhodococcus were reported to be able to grow on non methane short chain gaseous alkanes scgas shennan 2006 for example mycobacterium strain nbb4 contains various of monooxygenases for alkanes oxidation and catabolic enzymes related to alkanes assimilation giving its capability to grow on multiple hydrocarbon substrates coleman et al 2011 rhodococcus ruber iegm 231 a strain isolated from the site near an oil extracting enterprise could oxidize c3h8 ivshina et al 2014 in addition two genera affiliated to burkholderiaceae have been reported to oxidize hydrocarbon toluene lünsmann et al 2016 the enrichment of these microorganisms in the biofilms indicates their potential roles in oxidizing c2h6 c3h8 based on these enriched aerobic microorganisms and no obvious c2h6 and c3h8 consumption was observed under anaerobic condition in batch test d we can conclude that aerobic oxidation of c2h6 and c3h8 should be the key mechanism to activate these gaseous alkanes theoretically by using c2h6 c3h8 monooxygenases c2h6 c3h8 oxidizing microorganisms are capable of incorporating one atom of o2 into the carbon hydrogen bonds of these gaseous alkanes thus catalyzing the oxidation of c2h6 and c3h8 to ethanol or propanol respectively shennan 2006 alcohols dehydrogenases then catalyze these alcohols into acetaldehyde propionaldehyde which are further oxidized to acetate propionate by aldehydes dehydrogenase and the produced acids could ultimately be oxidized to co2 during the oxidation processes electrons could be released the enrichment of predictive genes associated with alkane monooxygenases and alcohol dehydrogenases by picrust analysis support the key role of these aerobic alkanes oxidizing bacteria for c2h6 and c3h8 activation moreover hyphomicrobium variovorax tahibacter and ferruginibacter were enriched in the biofilms many species affiliated to these genera are well known denitrifiers kloos et al 1995 im et al 2010 wu et al 2019 or involved in denitrification metabolisms xia et al 2019 it has been documented that denitrifiers are potential selenate reducers since several membrane bounding and periplasmic nitrate reductases are capable of reducing se vi sabaty et al 2001 the increased abundance of predictive genes related to nitrate reductases in the biofilms further indicates nitrate reductases might have carried out se vi reduction in the c2h6 c3h8 fed biofilms in addition the much higher abundance of predictive genes related to nitrite reductases in the biofilms than that in the inoculum indicates nitrite reductases might contribute to further reduction of se iv to se0 nitrite reductase in thauera selenatis has been reported to be involved in se iv reduction demoll decker et al 1993 therefore the enrichment of these denitrifiers in the biofilms suggest they may have performed se vi and se iv bio reduction through nitrate reductases and nitrite reductases respectively using the released electrons from aerobic oxidation of c2h6 or c3h8 based on microbial community structure in the biofilms it seems that the synergy between two functional groups alkanes oxidizing bacteria and se vi reducers carried out c2h6 c3h8 oxidation and se vi bio reduction in a cross feeding pattern it is similar to the archaea bacteria consortia reported by chen et al 2019 and laso pérez et al 2016 in which archaea performed anaerobic ethane butane oxidation and sulfate reducing bacteria carried out so4 2 reduction however since a few alkanes oxidizing bacteria e g mycobacterium and rhodococcus could have the denitrification capability chen et al 2012 angeby et al 2002 we cannot exclude the possibility that mycobacterium and rhodococcus independently performed simultaneous se vi reduction and c2h6 c3h8 oxidation further studies are required to elucidate and verify microbial mechanisms of se vi bio reduction driven by c2h6 and c3h8 through more advanced molecular technologies e g isotopic experiments and various meta omics 4 2 implications of this study in addition to methane reported in previous studies lai et al 2016 luo et al 2018 this study demonstrated it is potential to use c2h6 and c3h8 contained in shale gas to reduce se vi the c2h6 and c3h8 supported se vi removal rate in this study could reach up to 1 mg se l h based on batch test a which is even higher than the obtained rates in h2 and ch4 based mbfrs 0 3 0 5 mg se l h in previous studies lai et al 2014 2016 the two systems were also effective to remove environmentally relevant selenate concentration 0 2 mg se l implying their capability to treat se vi under practical conditions mayland et al 1989 in this study the mbfr configuration was employed for delivering c2h6 and c3h8 due to its high gas utilizing efficiency thus minimizing potential greenhouse gas leakage thus the proposed process is more suitable for ex situ removing se vi from contaminated groundwater rather than in situ remediation in fact the co existence of shale gas and se has been found in many shale gas exploitation sites balaba and smart 2012 parnell et al 2016 massive of se embedded in the shales readily migrates into groundwater via leaching of rock waste and subsurface leaching especially when shale gas is being exploited stillings and amacher 2010 us de 2011 thus imposing a serious threat to aquatic ecosystems previous studies reported that both c2h6 and c3h8 can be utilized to remove organic pollutants e g trichloroethylene tce and n nitrosodimethylamine ndma for example hashimoto et al 2002 reported the cometabolic degradation of tce and trichloroethane tca by c2h6 utilizing microorganism mycobacterium sp ta27 recently hatzinger lippincott et al 2019 demonstrated in situ ndma degradation by sparging air and c3h8 directly into an ndma contaminated aquifer therefore it is potential to utilize the gaseous electron donors ch4 c2h6 and c3h8 for the development of in situ technology to remediate se or organic contaminants from groundwater near shale gas exploitation sites it should be noted that further studies are required to test the real shale gas consisting of all ch4 c2h6 and c3h8 and calculate the contribution from each composition in addition the wide distribution of non methane scgas e g shales oceans sediments soils gasoline spills sewage sludges and anaerobic digestors etiope and ciccioli 2009 shennan 2006 and se e g shales soils earth crust minerals agricultural irrigation mining and se related industries johnson et al 1999 letey 2002 shah et al 2008 gives many potential opportunities for their intersection therefore this study also indicate se vi bio reduction coupled to c2h6 c3h8 oxidation might contribute to an important role in geochemical cycling of shale gas based carbon and se 5 conclusions in this study we demonstrated se vi bio reduction using c2h6 or c3h8 as electron donors and carbon sources the major reduction product was se0 nanospheres phas were synthesized in the biofilms in presence of c2h6 or c3h8 while they would be degraded for supporting se vi reduction when these gaseous alkanes were absent mycobacterium seems to play a role in oxidizing c2h6 while rhodococcus was likely involved in oxidizing c3h8 in addition it seems that some se vi reducers e g variovorax carried out se vi reduction these findings offer insights into the application of shale gas for microbial reduction of selenate thus supporting the development of cost effective solutions for groundwater remediation further studies are required to elucidate and verify microbial
