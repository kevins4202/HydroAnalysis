of auv head with grid sandwich structure as shown in fig 1 the pressure shell consists of skin grid sandwich structure and tail with solid to connect other part shells the material properties of 7075 t6 aluminum alloy are given in table 1 the geometric model established is mainly determined by 6 parameters i e l is the total length l is the tail length h is the total thickness d is the maximum diameter t 1 is the width of transverse grid and t 2 is the width of longitudinal grid the thicknesses of inner and outer skins are both 2 mm z 1 and z 2 are the numbers of transverse and longitudinal grids respectively to preliminarily estimate whether the strength failure of the model will occur under given working conditions the strength of the pressure shell model should be checked the geometric parameters of the pressure shell model are shown in table 2 the finite element model is established as follows four node cell is used mesh sizes of skin and tail are 5 mm 5 mm and mesh size of grid sandwich structure is 2 5 mm 2 5 mm the displacement constraint and weak spring are used at the bottom end face of the pressure shell chen and liu 2018 the axial displacement is set to 0 and

the maximum von mises stress is 333 18 mpa and appears near outer skin of between grid and tail part which can meet the strength requirement therefore using the pressure shell model with grid sandwich is feasible according to the above analysis results 3 optimization design strategy in addition an optimal mathematical model of the pressure shell needs to be established in the aspect of geometric parameters the main optimization process of the grid structure is given in fig 3 the main strategies include determining design variable building surrogate model and solving the optimization model the sample data is obtained by selecting design variable and fme then a surrogate model is built based upon the sample data the optimal mathematical model for grid sandwich structure is established and then solved by using ga whitley 2007 3 1 design variables design variables are the widths of transverse grid t 1 and longitudinal grid t 2 the numbers of transverse grid z 1 and longitudinal grid z 2 the maximum and minimum values of design variables are listed in table 3 3 2 the optimal mathematical model the mass of the pressure shell needs to achieve the minimum value moreover the maximum von mises stress of shell should achieve the minimum value in meeting strength requirement because engineering problems pay attention to the reliability a bi objective optimal mathematical model is expressed as 1 min m z min s max z s t s max z σ s 2 t 1 8 2 t 2 8 10 z 1 20 6 z 2 12 where z is a variable set and z t 1 t 2 z 1 z 2 m z is a mass function of the pressure shell s max z is the maximum von mises stress function 4 establishment of surrogate model it is difficult to determine function relationship between input and output variables in engineering problems the establishment of surrogate model is a common method a large number of samples are needed to build a surrogate model and verify the accuracy of developed model in this study 120 input output data about the maximum von mises stress and mass are obtained by parametric modeling and fem then 100 samples are randomly extracted to establish surrogate model and the remaining 20 samples are used as testing data for verifying the accuracy of developed model zhang 2006 4 1 surrogate model the second order response surface model is widely used in optimization design because of its relatively less computational complexity and high fitting accuracy a general form of response surface model is expressed as khuri and mukhopadhyay 2010 2 y c 0 i 1 n 1 c i x i i 1 n 1 c i i x i 2 i 1 n 1 1 j i 1 n 1 c i j x i x j where y is the initial response n 1 is the number of design variable x i and x j are the design variable c i c ii and c ij are the undetermined coefficients the number of terms k in polynomial is written as 3 k n 1 1 n 1 2 2 back propagation bp neural network can find input output relationships without defining mathematical equations in advance and predict output results based on input data the structure of bp neural network is shown in fig 4 which consists of input layer hidden layer and output layer the neurons between two adjacent layers are connected by weights and thresholds in fig 4 x i is the input design variable i 1 2 m y k is the output result k 1 2 n ω ij is the weight between input layer and hidden layer ω jk is the weight between hidden layer and output layer a i and b k are the threshold values the mean square error mse and correlation coefficient r 2 are used as accuracy indicators of surrogate model additionally the average relative error of test data e r is expressed as 4 e r 1 n 2 i 1 n 2 f i f ˆ i f i 100 where f i is the fem result of sample points f ˆ i is the predicted value of surrogate model n 2 is the number of test data the value of r 2 is between 0 and 1 and usually more than 0 9 as its criterion of acceptability the mathematical express of r 2 can be written as 5 r 2 i 1 n 1 f i f 2 i 1 n 1 f i f ˆ i 2 i 1 n 1 f i f 2 where f is the mean value of fem n 1 denotes the number of sample points and i refers to the ith sample point mse is obtained by actual and predicted values which can be calculated as 6 m s e i 1 n 1 f i f ˆ i 2 n 1 1 4 2 selection of surrogate model the second order response surface models of the maximum von mises stress and mass are established as 7 m z 3 959 0 232 t 1 0 186 t 2 0 038 z 1 0 203 z 2 0 007 t 1 t 2 0 006 t 1 z 1 0 003 t 1 z 2 0 005 z 1 z 2 0 015 t 1 2 0 001 t 2 2 0 005 z 2 2 8 s max z 718 395 6 559 t 1 21 672 t 2 3 397 z 1 45 784 z 2 0 830 t 1 t 2 0 117 t 1 z 1 0 471 t 1 z 2 0 953 t 2 z 1 0 433 t 2 z 2 0 572 z 1 z 2 0 619 t 1 2 0 350 t 2 2 0 360 z 1 2 0 852 z 2 2 the main parameters of bp neural network are set as follows the input layer is 4 and the output layer is 1 of two neural networks because the number of design variable is 4 the number of hidden layer node should be less than m n 0 10 and the initial selection is 5 the learning rate is generally between 0 and 1 and 0 1 is selected in this study the number of iterations is 100 li et al 2018 the evaluation index results of surrogate model i e second order rsm and bp neural network are given in table 4 it can be found that the value of r is 0 99 and the value of mse and e r are close to 0 for two kinds of surrogate models about m which reach a high accuracy from the evaluation index however the mse of rsm is larger than that of the bp neural network in terms of s max therefore the surrogate models of the objective and constraint functions are established using bp neural network in addition due to the value of r about s max is less than 0 9 the accuracy of the bp neural network surrogate models about s max cannot meet requirement 4 3 optimizing the bp neural network about the maximum von mises pressure the accuracy of the bp neural network for mass can be used but the result for the maximum von mises stress needs to be improved changing the number of hidden layer node is used to get a relatively accurate surrogate model the e r of testing data in different hidden layer nodes are shown in table 5 it can be seen that adjusting the number of hidden layer nodes has a small effect on accuracy improvement 1 particle swarm optimization algorithm to improve the accuracy of this bp neural network particle swarm optimization pso poli et al 2007 is used to find the most fitness weight and threshold values of this bp neural network the basic process to optimize the bp neural network is shown in fig 5 first parameters of the particle swarm are set and the random initial weights ω ij ω jk and thresholds a i b k of the bp neural network are obtained second the e r is taken into the objective function to calculate the values of fitness function current individual and whole extreme value are found based on fitness values then particles travel at a certain velocity in searching space whose velocity and position are updated and determined as 9 v i d k 1 d v i d k c 1 u 1 p i d k x i d k c 2 u 2 p g d k x i d k 10 x i d k 1 x i d k v i d k 1 where d is an inertia weight c 1 and c 2 are two nonnegative acceleration constants u 1 and u 2 are two random numbers greater than 0 and less than 1 p id k and p gd k are the individual extreme value and the best global optimal solution in the kth generation respectively x id k and v id k of the kth generation are position and velocity of the ith particle in d dimensional space respectively finally the velocity and position of particles are judged whether the termination condition has been reached if precision is met the optimization process is finished the weights and threshold values are exported otherwise it will go back to the next loop until meeting termination conditions this bp neural network continues to be trained on the basis of optimized weights and thresholds 2 the result of the bp neural network the main parameters of pso algorithm are set as follows the acceleration constants c 1 and c 2 are both 1 494 the maximum iteration n 3 is 100 the number of particles s is 40 the inertia weight d is 1 the optimization iteration process and the performance of neural network are shown in fig 6 from fig 6 the iteration process tends to converge and the optimal solution is found in iteration process mse of the optimized bp neural network eventually converges to 2 5 10 3 which is much smaller than that before optimization the correlation coefficient r 2 of training validation and testing sample data reach 0 9 the comparison between the test and predicted outputs is plotted in fig 7 although there is a difference between the test and predicted outputs the values of sample points are very close the average relative error of test data e r is 2 445 on the whole the accuracy of the optimized bp neural network can be accepted 5 optimization problem solution and result analysis with determination of design variables and establishment of surrogate model the optimal mathematical model is successfully established then the optimization model needs to be solved on the basis of surrogate model 5 1 solving optimization model by ga genetic algorithm ga is a common algorithm to solve optimization problems and imitates the evolution mechanism of natural organisms the basic process of ga is shown in fig 8 the main parameters of the ga are set as the population size is 20 the maximum iteration is 100 the probability of crossover and variation are 0 4 and 0 05 respectively the offspring can be obtained using roulette wheel selection method uniform crossover and single point mutation operator the optimal design result can be obtained as shown in table 6 due to z 1 and z 2 should be integers the final optimization result is acquired i e t 1 6 4 mm t 2 3 08 mm z 1 14 and z 2 10 5 2 checking the optimized pressure shell model the optimized size is used for the pressure shell which is analyzed by fem the maximum von mises stress of the pressure shell s max is 250 2 mpa as shown in fig 9 and appears near the same position as before optimization which can meet strength requirement the mass of grid sandwich pressure shell is 7 062 kg and is reduced by 38 26 compared with the solid shell whose mass is 11 439 kg at the same size in addition buckling deformation problem may occur before strength failure and buckling of the optimized pressure shell is analyzed by fem the eigenvalue buckling nephogram is shown in fig 10 the result shows that the buckling pattern of the pressure shell occurs at the bottom due to the critical load factor is 21 611 and buckling deformation will not occur under given conditions 5 3 influence analysis of the grid width it can be found that the width of transverse grid t 1 is bigger than the width of longitudinal grid t 2 from the optimized results influence of the grid widths i e t 1 and t 2 for objective and constraint functions is analyzed the relationship between the grid widths i e t 1 and t 2 and the pressure shell mass m and the relationship between the grid widths i e t 1 and t 2 and the maximum von mises stress s max are shown in fig 11 fig 11 shows that m is positively correlated with t 1 and t 2 but the s max decreases with the increase of t 1 and t 2 although the change of t 2 has an effect on s max the change of t 1 has a greater influence on s max than that of t 2 the value of t 1 should be larger than t 2 during the design process for ensuring reliability 6 strength reliability analysis due to randomness in processing technology and working condition strength reliability analysis is applied for ensuring reliability the basis of judging is reliability r or failure probability p f the three sigma level is used to evaluate the auv in this study i e reliability is not less than 99 97 the process of reliability analysis is depicted in fig 12 the random variables are selected and sample data are sampled according to distribution regularity then a part of data is randomly selected from the sample data and carried out fem to get output i e the maximum von mises stress s max a bp neural network about random variables and s max is trained to predict the output i e the maximum von mises stress s max of all sample data the distribution regularity of the maximum von mises stress s max can be obtained finally the stress strength interference model is established based on the distribution regularity of s max and yield strength σ s then the structural reliability r of the optimized pressure shell can be obtained 6 1 random variables and distribution regularity of smax the random variables are selected from the three aspects geometric parameters material properties and load the statistical characteristics and parameters of random variables are given in table 7 according to above analysis the statistical histogram about the maximum von mises stress s max of the optimized pressure shell can be obtained the fitting curve can be drawn by using normal lognormal and weibull as shown in fig 13 it can be seen from fig 13 that the histogram of the maximum von mises stress s max is fitted well with normal and lognormal distribution but poorly with weibull distribution p p plot is used to verify that data conforms to the specified distribution in fig 14 p p plot is drawn according to the relationship between cumulative proportion of a variable and cumulative proportion of a given distribution the points in p p plot approximate a straight line fig 14 is used to further verify whether the data conforms to normal or lognormal as shown in fig 14 compared with normal distribution the sample points coinciding with the oblique line better for lognormal distribution therefore it can be considered that the maximum von mises stress s max approximately obeys lognormal distribution a general expression of s max with lognormal distribution is written as 11 f c c s max 1 c ξ 2 π exp ln c ξ 2 2 ζ 2 where 12 ξ ln μ c 1 μ c σ c 2 13 ζ ln 1 μ c σ c 2 where the mean of the maximum von mises stress μ c is 5 3661 mpa and the standard deviation σ c is 0 1095 mpa 6 2 stress strength interference model the yield ultimate strength obeys normal distribution whose probability density function is 14 f r r σ s 1 σ r 2 π exp r μ r 2 2 σ r 2 where the mean of yield ultimate strength μ r is 505 mpa and the standard deviation σ r is 33 431 mpa the difference between the maximum von mises stress and yield strength of random variable is z that is z r c the failure probability of the optimized pressure shell is 15 p f f z d z c f r r f c c d c d r 1 c ξ 2 π exp ln c ξ 2 2 ζ 2 d r c 1 σ r 2 π exp r μ r 2 2 σ r 2 d c 6 524 10 53 0 the reliability of the optimized pressure shell is 16 r 1 p f 100 99 97 according to the stress strength interference model blanchart 1996 the stress and strength will not interfere considering three kinds of random variables geometric parameters material properties and load 7 conclusion in this paper the grid sandwich structure is applied to the pressure shell of auv head an optimal mathematical model is established and this optimization model is solved for achieving lightweight design the mass of optimized pressure shell is 7 062 kg and 38 26 lower than the traditional solid model the maximum von mises stress of the pressure shell optimized is 250 2 mpa and appears near the outer skin between grid and tail part which can meet strength requirements for 500 m hydrostatic pressure in addition the buckling deformation will not occur in this situation the width of transverse grid t 1 has more influence on the maximum von mises stress than the width of longitudinal grid t 2 therefore it is recommended that the width of transverse grid t 1 should be larger than the width of longitudinal grid t 2 for ensuring shell reliability in addition reliability analysis of the optimized pressure shell is carried out considering the influence of random variables the results show that the maximum von mises stress obeys the lognormal distribution and the yield ultimate strength obeys normal distribution there is no interference between the maximum von mises stress and the yield ultimate strength indicating the reliability meets the three sigma level all the above discussion show that it is feasible to apply the pressure shell of auv head with grid sandwich structure which achieves lightweight design and ensures reliability of the pressure shell this study can also provide a reference for lightweight of pressure shell of other underwater equipment 8 replication of results the code and data for producing the presented

then solved by using ga whitley 2007 3 1 design variables design variables are the widths of transverse grid t 1 and longitudinal grid t 2 the numbers of transverse grid z 1 and longitudinal grid z 2 the maximum and minimum values of design variables are listed in table 3 3 2 the optimal mathematical model the mass of the pressure shell needs to achieve the minimum value moreover the maximum von mises stress of shell should achieve the minimum value in meeting strength requirement because engineering problems pay attention to the reliability a bi objective optimal mathematical model is expressed as 1 min m z min s max z s t s max z σ s 2 t 1 8 2 t 2 8 10 z 1 20 6 z 2 12 where z is a variable set and z t 1 t 2 z 1 z 2 m z is a mass function of the pressure shell s max z is the maximum von mises stress function 4 establishment of surrogate model it is difficult to determine function relationship between input and output variables in engineering problems the establishment of surrogate model is a common method a large number of samples are needed to build a surrogate model and verify the accuracy of developed model in this study 120 input output data about the maximum von mises stress and mass are obtained by parametric modeling and fem then 100 samples are randomly extracted to establish surrogate model and the remaining 20 samples are used as testing data for verifying the accuracy of developed model zhang 2006 4 1 surrogate model the second order response surface model is widely used in optimization design because of its relatively less computational complexity and high fitting accuracy a general form of response surface model is expressed as khuri and mukhopadhyay 2010 2 y c 0 i 1 n 1 c i x i i 1 n 1 c i i x i 2 i 1 n 1 1 j i 1 n 1 c i j x i x j where y is the initial response n 1 is the number of design variable x i and x j are the design variable c i c ii and c ij are the undetermined coefficients the number of terms k in polynomial is written as 3 k n 1 1 n 1 2 2 back propagation bp neural network can find input output relationships without defining mathematical equations in advance and predict output results based on input data the structure of bp neural network is shown in fig 4 which consists of input layer hidden layer and output layer the neurons between two adjacent layers are connected by weights and thresholds in fig 4 x i is the input design variable i 1 2 m y k is the output result k 1 2 n ω ij is the weight between input layer and hidden layer ω jk is the weight between hidden layer and output layer a i and b k are the threshold values the mean square error mse and correlation coefficient r 2 are used as accuracy indicators of surrogate model additionally the average relative error of test data e r is expressed as 4 e r 1 n 2 i 1 n 2 f i f ˆ i f i 100 where f i is the fem result of sample points f ˆ i is the predicted value of surrogate model n 2 is the number of test data the value of r 2 is between 0 and 1 and usually more than 0 9 as its criterion of acceptability the mathematical express of r 2 can be written as 5 r 2 i 1 n 1 f i f 2 i 1 n 1 f i f ˆ i 2 i 1 n 1 f i f 2 where f is the mean value of fem n 1 denotes the number of sample points and i refers to the ith sample point mse is obtained by actual and predicted values which can be calculated as 6 m s e i 1 n 1 f i f ˆ i 2 n 1 1 4 2 selection of surrogate model the second order response surface models of the maximum von mises stress and mass are established as 7 m z 3 959 0 232 t 1 0 186 t 2 0 038 z 1 0 203 z 2 0 007 t 1 t

networks because the number of design variable is 4 the number of hidden layer node should be less than m n 0 10 and the initial selection is 5 the learning rate is generally between 0 and 1 and 0 1 is selected in this study the number of iterations is 100 li et al 2018 the evaluation index results of surrogate model i e second order rsm and bp neural network are given in table 4 it can be found that the value of r is 0 99 and the value of mse and e r are close to 0 for two kinds of surrogate models about m which reach a high accuracy from the evaluation index however the mse of rsm is larger than that of the bp neural network in terms of s max therefore the surrogate models of the objective and constraint functions are established using bp neural network in addition due to the value of r about s max is less than 0 9 the accuracy of the bp neural network surrogate models about s max cannot meet requirement 4 3 optimizing the bp neural network about the maximum von mises pressure the accuracy of the bp neural network for mass can be used but the result for the maximum von mises stress needs to be improved changing the number of hidden layer node is used to get a relatively accurate surrogate model the e r of testing data in different hidden layer nodes are shown in table 5 it can be seen that adjusting the number of hidden layer nodes has a small effect on accuracy improvement 1 particle swarm optimization algorithm to improve the accuracy of this bp neural network particle swarm optimization pso poli et al 2007 is used to find the most fitness weight and threshold values of this bp neural network the basic process to optimize the bp neural network is shown in fig 5 first parameters of the particle swarm are set and the random initial weights ω ij ω jk and thresholds a i b k of the bp neural network are obtained second the e r is taken into the objective function to calculate the values of fitness function current individual and whole extreme value are found based on fitness values then particles travel at a certain velocity in searching space whose velocity and position are updated and determined as 9 v i d k 1 d v i d k c 1 u 1 p i d k x i d k c 2 u 2 p g d k x i d k 10 x i d k 1 x i d k v i d k 1 where d is an inertia weight c 1 and c 2 are two nonnegative acceleration constants u 1 and u 2 are two random numbers greater than 0 and less than 1 p id k and p gd k are the individual extreme value and the best global optimal solution in the kth generation respectively x id k and v id k of the kth generation are position and velocity of the ith particle in d dimensional space respectively finally the velocity and position of particles are judged whether the termination condition has been reached if precision is met the optimization process is finished the weights and threshold values are exported otherwise it will go back to the next loop until meeting termination conditions this bp neural network continues to be trained on the basis of optimized weights and thresholds 2 the result of the bp neural network the main parameters of pso algorithm are set as follows the acceleration constants c 1 and c 2 are both 1 494 the maximum iteration n 3 is 100 the number of particles s is 40 the inertia weight d is 1 the optimization iteration process and the performance of neural network are shown in fig 6 from fig 6 the iteration process tends to converge and the optimal solution is found in iteration process mse of the optimized bp neural network eventually converges to 2 5 10 3 which is much smaller than that before optimization the correlation coefficient r 2 of training validation and testing sample data reach 0 9 the comparison between the test and predicted outputs is plotted in fig 7 although there is a difference between the test and predicted outputs the values of sample points are very close the average relative error of test data e r is 2 445 on the whole the accuracy of the optimized bp neural network can be accepted 5 optimization problem solution and result analysis with determination of design variables and establishment of surrogate model the optimal mathematical model is successfully established then the optimization model needs to be solved on the basis of surrogate model 5 1 solving optimization model by ga genetic algorithm ga is a common algorithm to solve optimization problems and imitates the evolution mechanism of natural organisms the basic process of ga is shown in fig 8 the main parameters of the ga are set as the population size is 20 the maximum iteration is 100 the probability of crossover and variation are 0 4 and 0 05 respectively the offspring can be obtained using roulette wheel selection method uniform crossover and single point mutation operator the optimal design result can be obtained as shown in table 6 due to z 1 and z 2 should be integers the final optimization result is acquired i e t 1 6 4 mm t 2 3 08 mm z 1 14 and z 2 10 5 2 checking the optimized pressure shell model the optimized size is used for the pressure shell which is analyzed by fem the maximum von mises stress of the pressure shell s max is 250 2 mpa as shown in fig 9 and appears near the same position as before optimization which can meet strength requirement the mass of grid sandwich pressure shell is 7 062 kg and is reduced by 38 26 compared with the solid shell whose mass is 11 439 kg at the same size in addition buckling deformation problem may occur before strength failure and buckling of the optimized pressure shell is analyzed by fem the eigenvalue buckling nephogram is shown in fig 10 the result shows that the buckling pattern of the pressure shell occurs at the bottom due to the critical load factor is 21 611 and buckling deformation will not occur under given conditions 5 3 influence analysis of the grid width it can be found that the width of transverse grid t 1 is bigger than the width of longitudinal grid t 2 from the optimized results influence of the grid widths i e t 1 and t 2 for objective and constraint functions is analyzed the relationship between the grid widths i e t 1 and t 2 and the pressure shell mass m and the relationship between the grid widths i e t 1 and t 2 and the maximum von mises stress s max are shown in fig 11 fig 11 shows that m is positively correlated with t 1 and t 2 but the s max decreases with the increase of t 1 and t 2 although the change of t 2 has an effect on s max the change of t 1 has a greater influence on s max than that of t 2 the value of t 1 should be larger than t 2 during the design process for ensuring reliability 6 strength reliability analysis due to randomness in processing technology and working condition strength reliability analysis is applied for ensuring reliability the basis of judging is reliability r or failure probability p f the three sigma level is used to evaluate the auv in this study i e reliability is not less than 99 97 the process of reliability analysis is depicted in fig 12 the random variables are selected and sample data are sampled according to distribution regularity then a part of data is randomly selected from the sample data and carried out fem to get output i e the maximum von mises stress s max a bp neural network about random variables and s max is trained to predict the output i e the maximum von mises stress s max of all sample data the distribution regularity of the maximum von mises stress s max can be obtained finally the stress strength interference model is established based on the distribution regularity of s max and yield strength σ s then the structural reliability r of the optimized pressure shell can be obtained 6 1 random variables and distribution regularity of smax the random variables are selected from the three aspects geometric parameters material properties and load the statistical characteristics and parameters of random variables are given in table 7 according to above analysis the statistical histogram about the maximum von mises stress s max of the optimized pressure shell can be obtained the fitting curve can be drawn by using normal lognormal and weibull as shown in fig 13 it can be seen from fig 13 that the histogram of the maximum von mises stress s max is fitted well with normal and lognormal distribution but poorly with weibull distribution p p plot is used to verify that data conforms to the specified distribution in fig 14 p p plot is drawn according to the relationship between cumulative proportion of a variable and cumulative proportion of a given distribution the points in p p plot approximate a straight line fig 14 is used to further verify whether the data conforms to normal or lognormal as shown in fig 14 compared with normal distribution the sample points coinciding with the oblique line better for lognormal distribution therefore it can be considered that the maximum von mises stress s max approximately obeys lognormal distribution a general expression of s max with lognormal distribution is written as 11 f c c s max 1 c ξ 2 π exp ln c ξ 2 2 ζ 2 where 12 ξ ln μ c 1 μ c σ c 2 13 ζ ln 1 μ c σ c 2 where the mean of the maximum von mises stress μ c is 5 3661 mpa and the standard deviation σ c is 0 1095 mpa 6 2 stress strength interference model the yield ultimate strength obeys normal distribution whose probability density function is 14 f r r σ s 1 σ r 2 π exp r μ r 2 2 σ r 2 where the mean of yield ultimate strength μ r is 505 mpa and the standard deviation σ r is 33 431 mpa the difference between the maximum von mises stress and yield strength of random variable is z that is z r c the failure probability of the optimized pressure shell is 15 p f f z d z c f r r f c c d c d r 1 c ξ 2 π exp ln c ξ 2 2 ζ 2 d r c 1 σ r 2 π exp r μ r 2 2 σ r 2 d c 6 524 10 53 0 the reliability of the optimized pressure shell is 16 r 1 p f 100 99 97 according to the stress strength interference model blanchart 1996 the stress and strength will not interfere considering three kinds of random variables geometric parameters material properties and load 7 conclusion in this paper the grid sandwich structure is applied to the pressure shell of auv head an optimal mathematical model is established and this optimization model is solved for achieving lightweight design the mass of optimized pressure shell is 7 062 kg and 38 26 lower than the traditional solid model the maximum von mises stress of the pressure shell optimized is 250 2 mpa and appears near the outer skin between grid and tail part which can meet strength requirements for 500 m hydrostatic pressure in addition the buckling deformation will not occur in this situation the width of transverse grid t 1 has more influence on the maximum von mises stress than the width of longitudinal grid t 2 therefore it is recommended that the width of transverse grid t 1 should be larger than the width of longitudinal grid t 2 for ensuring shell reliability in addition reliability analysis of the optimized pressure shell is carried out considering the influence of random variables the results show that the maximum von mises stress obeys the lognormal distribution and the yield ultimate strength obeys normal distribution there is no interference between the maximum von mises stress and the yield ultimate strength indicating the reliability meets the three sigma level all the above discussion show that it is feasible to apply the pressure shell of auv head with grid sandwich structure which achieves lightweight design and ensures reliability of the pressure shell this study can also provide a reference for lightweight of pressure shell of other underwater equipment 8 replication of results the code and data for producing the presented

21016,the safety of offshore operations is highly dependent on the dynamic positioning dp capability of a vessel meanwhile dp capability comes down to the ability of the thrust generated by thrusters to counteract environmental forces therefore it is significant to investigate which thrusters are important to the position keeping ability of vessels however complex environmental factors make the investigation of thrusters importance more complicated hence this paper proposes a new method to identify the influence of each thruster on vessel s station keeping capability in different sea states the station keeping capability is quantified by a defined synthesized positioning ability criterion comprised by vessel position heading angle and consumed power through the comparison of different machine learning approaches support vector machine svm is used for building a surrogate model between dp capability and thrusters in order to determine the most sensitive thruster in the whole process of vessel operation an improved sensitivity analysis sa called pawn is employed along with statistical analysis to evaluate the significance of thrusters from different perspectives seventeen cases are investigated with respect to different thruster failures in various sea states the results show the proposed method is able to identify the significance of each thruster in different scenarios keywords dynamic positioning capability sensitivity analysis statistical analysis thruster failures 1 introduction as the exploration and exploitation of marine resources such as oil and gas renewable energy and other minerals marine operations are becoming more and more frequent in recent years due to the influence of environmental disturbances it represents significant safety and integrity challenges that shall threaten the offshore operations for the sake of safe offshore operations vessels with dynamic positioning dp system are playing a critical role they can automatically maintain the desired position in order to ensure that a loss of position shall not occur even after a worst case failure in all components dp 2 and dp 3 are designed with redundant power systems in which 20 of electrically generated power shall be reserved as 2016 the high position keeping ability of dp 2 and dp 3 enables them to work in various offshore operations their wide applications have drawn great attention from stakeholders many researchers devoted to optimizing control parameters improving controller performance and detecting thruster failure lee et al 2020 brodtkorb et al 2018 han et al 2020 however few of them investigated the interior relation between thrusters and the vessel s dp capability hence it is of great potential to analyze the interaction among thrusters and environmental factors for on board support of the vessel s dp capabilities improvement in order to test the operational safety of dp vessels a digital twin is introduced and widely used in the service of designing and evaluating system performance safety and structural integrity it is a digital model that integrates data from varying sources and can simulate all operations in the real asset while saving time and money the digital twin has been successfully applied in a simulation of dp operations as well as the assessment of dp capability skulstad et al 2019 as all dp vessels carry a risk of loss of position which has detrimental effects on personnel the environment and equipment chen nygärdet al 2016 they have a high requirement of dp capability for the assessment of dp capability of a vessel thruster s failures are also seen as the first concern in most of assessing guidelines karlsen et al 2016 it makes sense to use digital simulation platform for investigating whether vessels can provide sufficient forces using the rest of thrusters to counteract against environmental loads when a certain thruster failure occurs such as a tunnel thruster failure or a main thruster failure to date there have been many attempts to analyze thruster failure in marine operations xu et al developed a novel synthesized criterion to analyze the positioning performance of dp vessels various thruster failures were considered in the research xu et al 2017 benetazzo et al utilized a parity space approach and a luenberger observer to gain the residuals next the cumulative sum algorithm was applied on these residuals to detect and isolate thruster failures benetazzo et al 2015 sheng et al developed a program to investigate the dp capability of semi submersible vessels under the case of thruster failure sheng wen et al 2016 this research contributed to demonstrating the safety of the dp system and provided adequate guidance to the thrust system s design han et al used a deep convolutional neural network method to detect the potential thruster failure han et al 2020 this data driven method had a good performance to detect and isolate thruster failure without any vessel dependent models however the relation between dp capability and thruster failures is not investigated further for papers as mentioned above xu et al proposed a method using sensitivity analysis sa to investigate the influence of thrusters on positioning capability xu et al 2015 however the paper adopted local sa which can not reflect the characteristics of vessel sea keeping ability in whole input space cheng et al used global sa method to analyze thrusters importance to ship heading cheng et al 2019 nevertheless different thruster failure cases were not considered in their study in a word there are few researches to carry out a comprehensive analysis of how much contribution thrusters make to dp capability in the case of various thruster failures and different sea states this paper proposes a novel methodology to analyze the significance of each thruster on dp capability it could not only provide onboard support for improving dp capability but also give guidance for power system design as well as thrusters maintenance with the help of statistical analysis and sa the predominant contributions are as follows 1 positioning capability is quantified by a designed synthesized criterion made up of ship position heading angle and consumed power 2 machine learning ml and a modified pawn are combined to quantify the significance of each thruster 3 this method is applied to analyze the importance of each thruster during dp operation in different failure conditions and environmental load scenarios the rest of this paper is structured as follows the next section describes related works on dp capability assessment and sa section 3 details the procedure of obtaining significance of thrusters from data generation data preprocessing an optimal ml selection to significance analysis section 4 compares the performance of ml based on the benchmark function and tests the ability of the proposed method to analyze the importance of thrusters using professional simulator in a variety of scenarios section 5 is conclusion 2 related work 2 1 1dynamic positioning capability assessment some offshore operations like oil production pipe laying and drilling deeply rely on dp capability to maintain vessel position or heading within an accepted criterion traditionally dynamic positioning capability dpcap analysis is performed based on industrial standards such as imca m140 dnv gl ern and abs skp pivano et al 2017 dpcap studies test whether the vessel has favorable actuator capacity to counteract environmental loads while keeping a constant position wang et al 2018a however they have limited ability to provide other relevant and desired information a significant shortcoming of the quasi static dpcap analysis is the inability to consider the transient conditions during a failure and recovery after the failure pivano et al 2014 these deficiencies call for the development of next level dp capability analysis dynamic capability dyncap was proposed to determine the station keeping capability of a vessel using systematic time domain simulations it employs a complete six degree of freedom dof vessel model this model includes dynamic environmental loads a complete propulsion system with thrust losses and so on pivano et al 2014 one of the advantages of the dyncap analysis compared to traditional dpcap is that the limiting environment can be computed by applying a set of user defined acceptance criteria the position and heading excursion are set to allow a wide or narrow footprint the dnvgl st 0111 standard introduced detailed requirements principles and acceptance criteria as 2016 it also provides complete analysis methods for the three dp capability levels many researchers have been working on dp capability analysis for decades pivano et al performed full scale trials using the dyncap method to validate a vessel s station keeping capability pivano et al 2017 different comparisons were made by statistics of time domain data with various environmental loads xu et al investigated positioning performances for dp vessels considering thruster failure modes by a synthesized criterion xu et al 2017 the criterion is used to quantify the positioning ability by integrating positioning accuracy and consumed power however these criteria cannot fully represent the dp capability from the perspective of statistics in this study positioning capability refers to how well the dp vessel is positioned instead of the extremity of the environmental conditions the vessel can counteract as underlined by xu et al 2015 based on prior studies and our sa method wang et al 2018b positioning capability is quantified by time series ship parameters such as ship position heading and consumed power some aforementioned statistics of time domain data to analyze the dp capability of offshore vessels were accepted and adopted 2 2 sensitivity analysis sa is a powerful tool to identify how much the variation of model output can be apportioned to inputs pianosi and wagener 2015 sa in general is made up of variance based and density based methods variance based methods includes sobol todorov et al 2020 the fourier amplitude sensitivity test fast tarantola mara and the extend fast efast kovacs et al 2019 and so on a well known advantage of variance based methods is their ability to quantify the individual parameter contribution and the contribution resulting from parameter interactions zadeh et al 2017 however variance based methods do not completely represent the output uncertainty when the model output is highly skewed pianosi et al 2015 to overcome this drawback a new method called moment independent global sa method also known as density based method was proposed which includes an entropy based sensitivity measure yun et al 2019 and the δ sensitivity method plischkeabc 2013 however optimal bandwidth selection has a high computational cost hence the development of these methods has been limited francesca et al came up with a novel sa method called pawn that characterizes the output distribution by its cumulative distribution function cdf instead of probability distribution function pdf pianosi and wagener 2015 one advantage of pawn is that it hugely reduces computational cost because there is no need to compute unknown parameters for the approximation of empirical cdf another advantage is that sensitivity indices can be easily obtained by considering either entire range of variation of the model output or a sub range sa is widely applied for maritime applications with different purposes li et al applied a derivative based sa method to simplify a neural network nn model so as to predict ship motion li et al 2017 zhang et al adopted a sum of square derivatives to choose inputs for the nonlinear auto aggressive model in order to create a compact ship motion model zhang and liu 2014 mizythras et al proposed an sa to determine parameters that have impacts on vessel propulsion and maneuverability mizythras et al 2016 in this study based on our previous experience wang et al 2018b the pawn method is adopted to conduct an sa of thrusters in addition we make some modifications and improvements according to features of dp data 3 system structure this section outlines the procedure of significance analysis of thrusters in dp operations the workflow consists of three parts as shown in fig 1 the first part generates raw simulated dp data by dp simulator which is considered as a digital twin of a real vessel users are able to change inputs to the simulator such as sea states desired position and thruster states to simulate different scenarios to obtain several data sets after the behavior of vessel changes over time new raw sensor data are generated and come into the digital platform for further modeling and simulation the second part is data analysis that is made of data preprocessing and significance analysis outcomes of analysis are used to offer on board support of real vessel s operations as well as system optimization 3 1 dp data generation in the study the dp data are generated from a professional simulator in the offshore simulator centre the world s most advanced provider of simulators for demanding marine operations1 fig 2 illustrates the simulator conducting dp operation under the impact of environmental disturbances its position is limited within a red circle whose diameter is denoted as r the limit of heading is restricted by red sector whose angle is represented as θ fig 3 shows the environmental effects on the ship wind with an attack angle of α can be changed in the simulation current and wave coming from other directions are fixed in the study in fig 3 the earth fixed reference frame is denoted as xe ye the body fixed reference frame x y is fixed on the body of the vessel its origin is the vessel s center of gravity the dp vessel is equipped with six thrusters including four tunnel thrusters thruster 1 4 and two main thrusters thruster 5 and 6 in the simulator sea state thruster state and the desired position are all adjustable in this paper two different sea states are investigated as shown in table 1 the desired position is set to 0 0 thruster states involve various thruster failure modes based on our experiment design after the corresponding thrusters are shut off the rest of thrusters are used for actuating vessel to generate several groups of time domain dp data for each sea state experiments are performed on different thruster failure modes then ship position and heading are obtained after each experiment and the other ship state parameters such as thruster arguments are obtained as shown in table 3 these time series data are raw dp data they will be processed in the following step 3 2 data preprocessing data preprocessing makes it possible to ensure efficiency and accuracy for computation of the computed pawn sensitivity indices it requires three substeps that are splitting data denoising and normalization this experiment was set as a ship that was intact at the beginning but in failure mode by the end the whole experiment produced a lot of time series dp data related to various combinations of thruster failure modes and sea states these data are full of anomalies resulting from noise which would threaten the accuracy of sa in this paper isolation forest iforest was applied for data cleaning the iforest is an algorithm that uses a tree structure to isolate instances schneider et al 2016 it can i achieve a low linear time complexity and a small memory requirement and ii deal with the effects of swamping and masking effectively iforest detection is a two stage process the first stage uses the given training data to build an isolation tree the second one computes an average path length of each instance through isolation trees let x x 1 x 2 x m r m d be a sample set of m instances with d variate distribution firstly iforest is constructed by the proposed algorithm in liu et al 2012 secondly path length h x of each instance is computed by counting the number of edges from the root node to a leaf node in an itree next eq 1 is used to gain c ψ that is the average of h x given ψ 1 c ψ 2 h ψ 1 2 ψ 1 m ψ 2 1 ψ 2 0 o t h e r w i s e where ψ is the subsampling size during the stage of building an iforest h i is the harmonic number which can be estimated by euler s constant ln i 0 57721 finally eq 2 is used to calculate the score of every instance 2 s x ψ 2 e h x c ψ where e h x is the expectation of h x from the collection of itrees if s is close to 1 then the instance is seen as an anomaly and removed from the data set after data cleaning these data need to be normalized in the range of 0 1 by eq 3 for the purpose of formulating a synthesized criterion 3 x i x i ˆ m i n x ˆ m a x x ˆ m i n x ˆ i 1 l where x ˆ x 1 ˆ x 2 ˆ x l ˆ ℝ l d therein l is smaller than m because some abnormal instances are removed after the procedure of data pre processing the processed data will be used to create a synthesized criterion to construct a surrogate model 3 3 significance analysis significance analysis is the last step to identify the significance of thrusters it is comprised of statistical analysis and sa these two methods can analyze the significance of thrusters from different respects meanwhile the integration of both methods can provide guidance for power allocation dp system optimization statistical analysis focuses on statistical features of dp data by virtue of mean maximum value variance and pdf pivano et al 2017 as a supplementary instruction for sa it is able to show the variation of each of data attributes intuitively sa is capable of quantifying the contribution of each thruster to dp capability it is comprised of three portions 1 proposing a synthesized criteria to quantify dp capability 2 selecting an optimal ml method to build a surrogate model 3 using pawn to compute sensitivity indices 3 3 1 synthesized criterion to investigate the significance of every thruster on positioning capability in different sea states and failure modes a synthesized criterion that quantifies the positioning performance needs to be defined this criterion is used to evaluate how well the ship is positioned according to the dp capability level in dnvgl st 0111 standard assessment of station keeping capability is mainly based on statistics of the position deviation and heading deviation therefore position and heading should be integrated into the synthesized criterion in addition for ensuring the safety and accuracy of dp operations the dp vessel has a higher power requirement than other conventional vessels xu et al 2017 therefore power consumption is also taken into consideration in this criterion as a result we create a synthesized criterion by eq 4 to lump the above mentioned ship parameters together with extra modification to make it adapt to the sa method 4 v ω 1 d ω 2 a ω 3 p ω 1 ω 2 ω 3 1 cri ln v v 0 where ω 1 ω 2 and ω 3 are weighting factors within 0 1 d is position deviation computed by the distance between current and original position a denotes the heading angle variation p represents total power consumed by thrusters cri is the synthesized criterion computed by the inverse of the monotone increasing function ln the larger v is the worse the positioning capability cri compared to the exponential function in the interval 0 1 the minus of ln function can amplify the value of v to better reflect the distinction of positioning capability kuhlmann and tressl 2012 cri will be used as the model output when ml trains a surrogate model between thrusters parameters and dp capability 3 3 2 sensitivity analysis a modified pawn is adopted as an sa method to quantify the influence of thrusters to positioning capability compared with traditional method it is able to overcome the issue of being hard to define three parameters i e the number of unconditional input samples nu the number of conditional input samples nc and the number of conditional points n pianosi and wagener 2018 let x y be a generic sample where x is the processed input samples y denotes the value of quantifying dp capability it is handled by splitting the range of input factor x i into n equal subintervals ik the pawn indices approximation is shown as follows 5 s i ˆ m a x k 1 l k s i k k s i k max y f y y f y x i y x i i k where s i ˆ is sensitivity index ks is kolmogorov smirnov statistic f y y is unconditional cdf where y y and f y x i y x i i k is conditional cdf where x i is fixed using eq 5 to compute the sensitivity index ensures there is no need to specify n c it coincides with the number of points in i k as approximately n n where n is the size of the generic sample as for the unconditional sample n u a better option is to use subsample of y as the conditional ones i e n u n c the process of sa executed by pawn combined with ml is shown in algorithm 1 in this algorithm libsvm is used as an svm tool to train the surrogate model chang and lin 2011 the model training parameters like s t bestc bestg p v and the introduction of functions like svmcgforregress libsvmtrain and libsvmpredict can be found in chang and lin 2011 this algorithm mainly includes three parts the first part is modelling line 2 6 the thrust of all thrusters is the model input and the positioning capability as defined by cri above is the model output ml is employed to construct a surrogate model between the model input and output the second part is resampling line 6 7 unconditional sampling is used to generate unconditional samples pawn sampling is used to gain conditional samples the last part is sensitivity index computation line 9 10 the pawn indices of all thrusters are computed by pawn index its function is shown in line 11 17 line 12 13 is to calculate the unconditional output and conditional output line 14 16 is to compute the pawn index using eq 5 detailed computing process could be found in pianosi and wagener 2018 the introduction of parameters and functions regarding pawn method can be found in pianosi et al 2015 image 1 4 case study 4 1 an optimal ml selection based on ishigami function in order to find an optimal modeling method first of all three prevalent ml methods such as back propagation bp regularized extreme learning machine relm and svm are introduced into training models wang et al 2018b cui and jing 2019 shao and er 2016 next pawn combined with these three models is used to compute sensitivity indices of three parameters of ishigami function finally sa results are compared with a benchmark to identify the optimal ml method for analyzing the significance of thrusters in the course of determining an optimal ml method ishigami function is selected as a mathematical model because ishigami is a widely used benchmark model that is applied to test the validity of sensitivity analysis method pianosi and wagener 2015 it is shown in eq 6 6 y s i n χ 1 a s i n χ 2 2 b χ 3 4 s i n χ 1 where a and b are random constants that can influence the sensitivity index of χ i i 1 2 3 χ i follows a uniform distribution over π π here we set a 2 and b 1 fig 4 displays sa results as well as benchmark value the dotted line is the benchmark value of sensitivity indices of the three parameters χ i in eq 6 the corresponding sensitivity indices are s1 0 53 s2 0 19 and s3 0 35 respectively it is evident that both bp and relm cannot figure sensitivity index out correctly whereas pawn combined with svm has a better approximation to the benchmark therefore svm is selected as modelling method in the follow up sensitivity analysis of thrusters in different scenarios 4 2 experimental design this significance analysis of thrusters is conducted to determine the variation of positioning capability apportioned to each thruster the specifications of the vessel are listed in table 2 this vessel is actuated by six thrusters shown in fig 3 the actuator forces relate to the control forces and moments by τ t ξ f w h e r e ξ ξ 1 ξ p ℝ p is a vector of azimuth angles and t ξ is the thrust configuration matrix fossen 2011 in this paper ξ is fixed in order to obtain the demanded thrust for each thruster an unconstrained least squares ls optimization problem is constructed through using lagrange multipliers to solve ls optimization problem we can obtain f t τ where t w 1 t t w 1 t 1 is recognized as the generalized inverse gi matrix here w is a positive definite matrix weighting the control forces the detailed reasoning process has been interpreted in fossen 2011 the attack angles α is set as 45 90 135 for different scenarios the direction of current and wave is fixed for simplifying the experiment the limits of ship position and heading are set as r 3m and θ 6 respectively table 4 lists four different combinations of sea states and attack angle they are strong breeze 45 strong breeze 90 strong breeze 135 and fresh breeze 45 for strong breeze 45 there are seven different thruster failure modes represented by binary string 011111 101111 110111 111011 111101 111110 110110 here 0 denotes the thruster is malfunctioning 1 denotes the thruster is working normally for example 101111 indicates the second thruster is malfunctioning while the others are working normally the required parameters of ship states are listed in the table 3 the sampling frequency is set as 20hz the synthesized criterion involves specifying three weighting factors ω 1 ω 2 and ω 3 in this study we set ω 1 0 5 ω 2 0 4 and ω 3 0 1 based on the following reasons on the one hand since dp vessels are designed with the redundant power system in general 20 of power will be reserved to avoid loss of position occurrence that indicates the power is sufficient to keep a vessel s position and heading during dp operations therefore power utilization was considered the least important factor in the criterion on the other hand ship position is seen as the most significant factor because the loss of position brings a more considerable detrimental impact on dp operations than heading for pawn n is set to 10 based on the samples of data as well as experience as described in other papers wang et al 2018b pianosi and wagener 2018 in this paper the experiment investigates the significance of thrusters under circumstances of different thruster failures in two sea states using the proposed method for timely computation of thrusters sensitivity is studied as well 4 3 significance analysis in different thruster failure modes at two sea states this section mainly analyzes and compares sa results in different environmental factors and thruster conditions table 5 lists the sa results of thruster failures at the strong breeze and fresh breeze sea states it is found that thruster 5 is more significant than the rest of thrusters in most cases its contribution accounts for around 30 40 especially when thruster 6 fails to work the significance of thruster 5 exceeds 35 because thruster 5 as the only main propeller must generate much more thrust to counteract the influence of environmental disturbances when one thruster failure occurs the significance of thrusters that play a complementary role will have a significant increase as shown in table 5 for example the pawn index of thruster 6 increases from 8 to 30 when thruster 5 fails in strong breeze 45 the same happens to thruster 1 and 2 for the case of 101111 in strong breeze 45 for instance the significance of thruster 1 rises by 13 up to 26 42 for dual thruster failure 110110 in all sea states at least two of tunnel thrusters significance go up to over 20 compared with one thruster failure that possibly results from the drastic variation of the ship heading it is reflected from the above analysis that the significance of thrusters depends on the conjunction of sea states wind direction as well as thruster failures next significance analysis of thrusters is carried out in detail from the respect of statistics and sa in order to illustrate how to do analysis by sa coupled with statistical analysis we will use 111111 in the case of strong breeze with an attack angle 45 as an example for the case of 111111 in strong breeze 45 an average of thrust and sa results are shown in fig 5 the left y axis represents the pawn index of each thruster while the right one denotes mean value of thrust these two analysis methods are able to show the importance of thrusters from their own perspective in addition there are interior connections between these two methods the results of sa show that the order of importance of thrusters is quite as similar as that of statistical analysis the pawn index shows that thruster 5 has the most influential effect on positioning capability at 29 76 the second largest effect is thruster 4 accounting for roughly 22 46 thrusters 3 1 2 and 6 follow in that order thruster 6 makes only an 8 17 contribution to the station keeping ability of dp vessel despite its similarities to thruster 5 which makes the largest contribution however these two methods show some distinctions such as inconsistency of sa results with statistical analysis for thruster 6 from the perspective of statistics thruster 6 has as much thrust as thruster 5 as shown in fig 6 the mean and variance of thrust generated by thruster 5 are the same as those generated by thruster 6 the two thrusters also consume the same amount of power and have similar statistical features but observing results obtained by the proposed sa method in fig 5 in which all sa indices are drawn as blue bars shows that thruster 6 is far less significant than thruster 5 it is even less than thruster 2 it reveals that sa results do not entirely conform with results obtained by statistical analysis both methods did give us insights that thruster 6 consumed amounts of power but generated too much useless force in this case to obtain more insights from fig 5 thrusters 4 and 6 are for detailed investigation fig 7 displays the pdf of power consumed by thrusters 4 and 6 respectively the power consumed mostly appears in the interval 100 kw 600 kw which is far less than the power consumed by thruster 6 as shown in the blue area moreover the mean of thrust generated by thruster 4 is far less than that generated by thruster 6 based on figs 5 and 7 we can find that thruster 6 consumed more power and generated more thrust but less contribution than thruster 4 through sa and statistical analysis it is definitely found that some thrusters have fewer influences on dp capability although they consumed more power that results in a waste of power therefore significance results could be used to provide guidance to improve the power allocation algorithm for example sensitivity indices as weighting factors are added into the algorithm in this case thruster 6 with high power consumption but a little contribution to dp capability will be reallocated less power by the power system instead more power should be redistributed to thruster 4 which could improve dp capability with low power consumption 4 4 real time computation of thrusters sensitivity although the existing method is efficient to analyze the thrusters significance in xu et al 2015 it is not competent in the real time computation of thrusters sensitivity this section is to verify the feasibility of the proposed method in estimating thrusters sensitivity online a simulation experiment is carried out when thruster state changes from 111111 to 011111 in strong breeze 45 the thrust generated by thrusters is shown in fig 8 red dotted line represents the point at which thruster 1 fails to work in order to visualize each curve clearly multiple shifts of 80 kn along the y axis direction is performed for thruster 2 6 in fact the value of the thrust of all thrusters starts from 0 fig 9 shows the variation of sensitivity indices of thrusters over time the horizontal axis denotes sensitivity index is computed at a window time of 25s that comprises 500 sample points evidently the proposed method is able to gain the contribution of each thruster to the dp capability in the process of vessel counteracting against environmental forces especially when thruster 1 shuts down at 650s depicted by a red circle the importance of thruster 1 becomes 0 thereafter on the other hand thruster 2 plays a more and more important role since this point this is because thruster 1 and 2 are bow thrusters as shown in fig 3 the malfunction of thruster 1 leads to the rise of thruster 2 importance in the long term in addition the importance of other thrusters rises to some extent as well after thruster 1 fails to work at the point of 650s the detailed information can be found in the fig 10 from this figure the importance of thruster 2 and 4 grow rapidly compared with other thrusters therefore the instant change of the indices could provide the operator evidence to improve the power consuming of thruster 2 and 4 to promote the dp capability quickly after the failure of thruster 1 to sum up the proposed method is capable of finding the contribution of all thrusters in a real time manner 4 5 discussion for the case of 111111 in strong breeze 45 in fig 6 the discrepancy in terms of power and thrust between thruster 5 and 6 possibly results from the fact that the rudder angle of main thrusters is fixed as shown in fig 3 in order to resist the wind whose attack angle is 45 thruster 5 must bear much more load than thruster 6 therefore the power and thrust of thruster 5 vary more drastically compared with those of thruster 6 it can be shown from the above analysis that thruster s importance is affected by a synthesized factor including the configuration of thrusters the attack angle of sea states and the thrust allocation algorithm in fig 4 the result of bp and elm is not as ideal as that of svm this situation mainly results from the limited training sample on account of online significance analysis considering the requirement of on board support therefore svm is used for the real time estimation of sensitivity indices since the sensitivity index computed by svm can converge to a stable value after 500 training samples we chose a window time of 25s corresponding to 500 training samples under the sampling frequency of 20hz in section 4 4 6 conclusion this paper proposes a method that mainly focuses on studying the significance of thrusters based on a synthesized positioning capability criterion in different thruster failure conditions in order to quantify the dp capability a synthesized assessment criterion is proposed by integrating ship position heading and power next the ishigami function is used as a benchmark to determine an optimal modelling method through the comparison with ann and elm svm is selected to construct a surrogate model between thrusters and dp capability finally different thruster failure cases in two sea states are designed to elaborate on how statistical features and sa are combined to quantify and analyze the significance of thrusters the purpose of significance analysis results is as follows 1 they can provide onboard support to control power system to allocate more power to the most significant thruster when thruster fails to work which contributes to efficiently improving dp capability 2 they also can be used to provide guidance to optimize power allocation by observing statistics of power and sensitivity results thrusters that consumed more power but made much less contribution to positioning capability should be reallocated less power this is able to be accomplished by for example adding sensitivity indices as weighting factors into the allocation algorithm that is helpful to improve vessel s dp capability with less power consumption for future work efforts will be put on investigating the impact of azimuth thrusters and the thrust allocation logic on the significance of thrusters in dp

21016,the safety of offshore operations is highly dependent on the dynamic positioning dp capability of a vessel meanwhile dp capability comes down to the ability of the thrust generated by thrusters to counteract environmental forces therefore it is significant to investigate which thrusters are important to the position keeping ability of vessels however complex environmental factors make the investigation of thrusters importance more complicated hence this paper proposes a new method to identify the influence of each thruster on vessel s station keeping capability in different sea states the station keeping capability is quantified by a defined synthesized positioning ability criterion comprised by vessel position heading angle and consumed power through the comparison of different machine learning approaches support vector machine svm is used for building a surrogate model between dp capability and thrusters in order to determine the most sensitive thruster in the whole process of vessel operation an improved sensitivity analysis sa called pawn is employed along with statistical analysis to evaluate the significance of thrusters from different perspectives seventeen cases are investigated with respect to different thruster failures in various sea states the results show the proposed method is able to identify the significance of each thruster in different scenarios keywords dynamic positioning capability sensitivity analysis statistical analysis thruster failures 1 introduction as the exploration and exploitation of marine resources such as oil and gas renewable energy and other minerals marine operations are becoming more and more frequent in recent years due to the influence of environmental disturbances it represents significant safety and integrity challenges that shall threaten the offshore operations for the sake of safe offshore operations vessels with dynamic positioning dp system are playing a critical role they can automatically maintain the desired position in order to ensure that a loss of position shall not occur even after a worst case failure in all components dp 2 and dp 3 are designed with redundant power systems in which 20 of electrically generated power shall be reserved as 2016 the high position keeping ability of dp 2 and dp 3 enables them to work in various offshore operations their wide applications have drawn great attention from stakeholders many researchers devoted to optimizing control parameters improving controller performance and detecting thruster failure lee et al 2020 brodtkorb et al 2018 han et al 2020 however few of them investigated the interior relation between thrusters and the vessel s dp capability hence it is of great potential to analyze the interaction among thrusters and environmental factors for on board support of the vessel s dp capabilities improvement in order to test the operational safety of dp vessels a digital twin is introduced and widely used in the service of designing and evaluating system performance safety and structural integrity it is a digital model that integrates data from varying sources and can simulate all operations in the real asset while saving time and money the digital twin has been successfully applied in a simulation of dp operations as well as the assessment of dp capability skulstad et al 2019 as all dp vessels carry a risk of loss of position which has detrimental effects on personnel the environment and equipment chen nygärdet al 2016 they have a high requirement of dp capability for the assessment of dp capability of a vessel thruster s failures are also seen as the first concern in most of assessing guidelines karlsen et al 2016 it makes sense to use digital simulation platform for investigating whether vessels can provide sufficient forces using the rest of thrusters to counteract against environmental loads when a certain thruster failure occurs such as a tunnel thruster failure or a main thruster failure to date there have been many attempts to analyze thruster failure in marine operations xu et al developed a novel synthesized criterion to analyze the positioning performance of dp vessels various thruster failures were considered in the research xu et al 2017 benetazzo et al utilized a parity space approach and a luenberger observer to gain the residuals next the cumulative sum algorithm was applied on these residuals to detect and isolate thruster failures benetazzo et al 2015 sheng et al developed a program to investigate the dp capability of semi submersible vessels under the case of thruster failure sheng wen et al 2016 this research contributed to demonstrating the safety of the dp system and provided adequate guidance to the thrust system s design han et al used a deep convolutional neural network method to detect the potential thruster failure han et al 2020 this data driven method had a good performance to detect and isolate thruster failure without any vessel dependent models however the relation between dp capability and thruster failures is not investigated further for papers as mentioned above xu et al proposed a method using sensitivity analysis sa to investigate the influence of thrusters on positioning capability xu et al 2015 however the paper adopted local sa which can not reflect the characteristics of vessel sea keeping ability in whole input space cheng et al used global sa method to analyze thrusters importance to ship heading cheng et al 2019 nevertheless different thruster failure cases were not considered in their study in a word there are few researches to carry out a comprehensive analysis of how much contribution thrusters make to dp capability in the case of various thruster failures and different sea states this paper proposes a novel methodology to analyze the significance of each thruster on dp capability it could not only provide onboard support for improving dp capability but also give guidance for power system design as well as thrusters maintenance with the help of statistical analysis and sa the predominant contributions are as follows 1 positioning capability is quantified by a designed synthesized criterion made up of ship position heading angle and consumed power 2 machine learning ml and a modified pawn are combined to quantify the significance of each thruster 3 this method is applied to analyze the importance of each thruster during dp operation in different failure conditions and environmental load scenarios the rest of this paper is structured as follows the next section describes related works on dp capability assessment and sa section 3 details the procedure of obtaining significance of thrusters from data generation data preprocessing an optimal ml selection to significance analysis section 4 compares the performance of ml based on the benchmark function and tests the ability of the proposed method to analyze the importance of thrusters using professional simulator in a variety of scenarios section 5 is conclusion 2 related work 2 1 1dynamic positioning capability assessment some offshore operations like oil production pipe laying and drilling deeply rely on dp capability to maintain vessel position or heading within an accepted criterion traditionally dynamic positioning capability dpcap analysis is performed based on industrial standards such as imca m140 dnv gl ern and abs skp pivano et al 2017 dpcap studies test whether the vessel has favorable actuator capacity to counteract environmental loads while keeping a constant position wang et al 2018a however they have limited ability to provide other relevant and desired information a significant shortcoming of the quasi static dpcap analysis is the inability to consider the transient conditions during a failure and recovery after the failure pivano et al 2014 these deficiencies call for the development of next level dp capability analysis dynamic capability dyncap was proposed to determine the station keeping capability of a vessel using systematic time domain simulations it employs a complete six degree of freedom dof vessel model this model includes dynamic environmental loads a complete propulsion system with thrust losses and so on pivano et al 2014 one of the advantages of the dyncap analysis compared to traditional dpcap is that the limiting environment can be computed by applying a set of user defined acceptance criteria the position and heading excursion are set to allow a wide or narrow footprint the dnvgl st 0111 standard introduced detailed requirements principles and acceptance criteria as 2016 it also provides complete analysis methods for the three dp capability levels many researchers have been working on dp capability analysis for decades pivano et al performed full scale trials using the dyncap method to validate a vessel s station keeping capability pivano et al 2017 different comparisons were made by statistics of time domain data with various environmental loads xu et al investigated positioning performances for dp vessels considering thruster failure modes by a synthesized criterion xu et al 2017 the criterion is used to quantify the positioning ability by integrating positioning accuracy and consumed power however these criteria cannot fully represent the dp capability from the perspective of statistics in this study positioning capability refers to how well the dp vessel is positioned instead of the extremity of the environmental conditions the vessel can counteract as underlined by xu et al 2015 based on prior studies and our sa method wang et al 2018b positioning capability is quantified by time series ship parameters such as ship position heading and consumed power some aforementioned statistics of time domain data to analyze the dp capability of offshore vessels were accepted and adopted 2 2 sensitivity analysis sa is a powerful tool to identify how much the variation of model output can be apportioned to inputs pianosi and wagener 2015 sa in general is made up of variance based and density based methods variance based methods includes sobol todorov et al 2020 the fourier amplitude sensitivity test fast tarantola mara and the extend fast efast kovacs et al 2019 and so on a well known advantage of variance based methods is their ability to quantify the individual parameter contribution and the contribution resulting from parameter interactions zadeh et al 2017 however variance based methods do not completely represent the output uncertainty when the model output is highly skewed pianosi et al 2015 to overcome this drawback a new method called moment independent global sa method also known as density based method was proposed which includes an entropy based sensitivity measure yun et al 2019 and the δ sensitivity method plischkeabc 2013 however optimal bandwidth selection has a high computational cost hence the development of these methods has been limited francesca et al came up with a novel sa method called pawn that characterizes the output distribution by its cumulative distribution function cdf instead of probability distribution function pdf pianosi and wagener 2015 one advantage of pawn is that it hugely reduces computational cost because there is no need to compute unknown parameters for the approximation of empirical cdf another advantage is that sensitivity indices can be easily obtained by considering either entire range of variation of the model output or a sub range sa is widely applied for maritime applications with different purposes li et al applied a derivative based sa method to simplify a neural network nn model so as to predict ship motion li et al 2017 zhang et al adopted a sum of square derivatives to choose inputs for the nonlinear auto aggressive model in order to create a compact ship motion model zhang and liu 2014 mizythras et al proposed an sa to determine parameters that have impacts on vessel propulsion and maneuverability mizythras et al 2016 in this study based on our previous experience wang et al 2018b the pawn method is adopted to conduct an sa of thrusters in addition we make some modifications and improvements according to features of dp data 3 system structure this section outlines the procedure of significance analysis of thrusters in dp operations the workflow consists of three parts as shown in fig 1 the first part generates raw simulated dp data by dp simulator which is considered as a digital twin of a real vessel users are able to change inputs to the simulator such as sea states desired position and thruster states to simulate different scenarios to obtain several data sets after the behavior of vessel changes over time new raw sensor data are generated and come into the digital platform for further modeling and simulation the second part is data analysis that is made of data preprocessing and significance analysis outcomes of analysis are used to offer on board support of real vessel s operations as well as system optimization 3 1 dp data generation in the study the dp data are generated from a professional simulator in the offshore simulator centre the world s most advanced provider of simulators for demanding marine operations1 fig 2 illustrates the simulator conducting dp operation under the impact of environmental disturbances its position is limited within a red circle whose diameter is denoted as r the limit of heading is restricted by red sector whose angle is represented as θ fig 3 shows the environmental effects on the ship wind with an attack angle of α can be changed in the simulation current and wave coming from other directions are fixed in the study in fig 3 the earth fixed reference frame is denoted as xe ye the body fixed reference frame x y is fixed on the body of the vessel its origin is the vessel s center of gravity the dp vessel is equipped with six thrusters including four tunnel thrusters thruster 1 4 and two main thrusters thruster 5 and 6 in the simulator sea state thruster state and the desired position are all adjustable in this paper two different sea states are investigated as shown in table 1 the desired position is set to 0 0 thruster states involve various thruster failure modes based on our experiment design after the corresponding thrusters are shut off the rest of thrusters are used for actuating vessel to generate several groups of time domain dp data for each sea state experiments are performed on different thruster failure modes then ship position and heading are obtained after each experiment and the other ship state parameters such as thruster arguments are obtained as shown in table 3 these time series data are raw dp data they will be processed in the following step 3 2 data preprocessing data preprocessing makes it possible to ensure efficiency and accuracy for computation of the computed pawn sensitivity indices it requires three substeps that are splitting data denoising and normalization this experiment was set as a ship that was intact at the beginning but in failure mode by the end the whole experiment produced a lot of time series dp data related to various combinations of thruster failure modes and sea states these data are full of anomalies resulting from noise which would threaten the accuracy of sa in this paper isolation forest iforest was applied for data cleaning the iforest is an algorithm that uses a tree structure to isolate instances schneider et al 2016 it can i achieve a low linear time complexity and a small memory requirement and ii deal with the effects of swamping and masking effectively iforest detection is a two stage process the first stage uses the given training data to build an isolation tree the second one computes an average path length of each instance through isolation trees let x x 1 x 2 x m r m d be a sample set of m instances with d variate distribution firstly iforest is constructed by the proposed algorithm in liu et al 2012 secondly path length h x of each instance is computed by counting the number of edges from the root node to a leaf node in an itree next eq 1 is used to gain c ψ that is the average of h x given ψ 1 c ψ 2 h ψ 1 2 ψ 1 m ψ 2 1 ψ 2 0 o t h e r w i s e where ψ is the subsampling size during the stage of building an iforest h i is the harmonic number which can be estimated by euler s constant ln i 0 57721 finally eq 2 is used to calculate the score of every instance 2 s x ψ 2 e h x c ψ where e h x is the expectation of h x from the collection of itrees if s is close to 1 then the instance is seen as an anomaly and removed from the data set after data cleaning these data need to be normalized in the range of 0 1 by eq 3 for the purpose of formulating a synthesized criterion 3 x i x i ˆ m i n x ˆ m a x x ˆ m i n x ˆ i 1 l where x ˆ x 1 ˆ x 2 ˆ x l ˆ ℝ l d therein l is smaller than m because some abnormal instances are removed after the procedure of data pre processing the processed data will be used to create a synthesized criterion to construct a surrogate model 3 3 significance analysis significance analysis is the last step to identify the significance of thrusters it is comprised of statistical analysis and sa these two methods can analyze the significance of thrusters from different respects meanwhile the integration of both methods can provide guidance for power allocation dp system optimization statistical analysis focuses on statistical features of dp data by virtue of mean maximum value variance and pdf pivano et al 2017 as a supplementary instruction for sa it is able to show the variation of each of data attributes intuitively sa is capable of quantifying the contribution of each thruster to dp capability it is comprised of three portions 1 proposing a synthesized criteria to quantify dp capability 2 selecting an optimal ml method to build a surrogate model 3 using pawn to compute sensitivity indices 3 3 1 synthesized criterion to investigate the significance of every thruster on positioning capability in different sea states and failure modes a synthesized criterion that quantifies the positioning performance needs to be defined this criterion is used to evaluate how well the ship is positioned according to the dp capability level in dnvgl st 0111 standard assessment of station keeping capability is mainly based on statistics of the position deviation and heading deviation therefore position and heading should be integrated into the synthesized criterion in addition for ensuring the safety and accuracy of dp operations the dp vessel has a higher power requirement than other conventional vessels xu et al 2017 therefore power consumption is also taken into consideration in this criterion as a result we create a synthesized criterion by eq 4 to lump the above mentioned ship parameters together with extra modification to make it adapt to the sa method 4 v ω 1 d ω 2 a ω 3 p ω 1 ω 2 ω 3 1 cri ln v v 0 where ω 1 ω 2 and ω 3 are weighting factors within 0 1 d is position deviation computed by the distance between current and original position a denotes the heading angle variation p represents total power consumed by thrusters cri is the synthesized criterion computed by the inverse of the monotone increasing function ln the larger v is the worse the positioning capability cri compared to the exponential function in the interval 0 1 the minus of ln function can amplify the value of v to better reflect the distinction of positioning capability kuhlmann and tressl 2012 cri will be used as the model output when ml trains a surrogate model between thrusters parameters and dp capability 3 3 2 sensitivity analysis a modified pawn is adopted as an sa method to quantify the influence of thrusters to positioning capability compared with traditional method it is able to overcome the issue of being hard to define three parameters i e the number of unconditional input samples nu the number of conditional input samples nc and the number of conditional points n pianosi and wagener 2018 let x y be a generic sample where x is the processed input samples y denotes the value of quantifying dp capability it is handled by splitting the range of input factor x i into n equal subintervals ik the pawn indices approximation is shown as follows 5 s i ˆ m a x k 1 l k s i k k s i k max y f y y f y x i y x i i k where s i ˆ is sensitivity index ks is kolmogorov smirnov statistic f y y is unconditional cdf where y y and f y x i y x i i k is conditional cdf where x i is fixed using eq 5 to compute the sensitivity index ensures there is no need to specify n c it coincides with the number of points in i k as approximately n n where n is the size of the generic sample as for the unconditional sample n u a better option is to use subsample of y as the conditional ones i e n u n c the process of sa executed by pawn combined with ml is shown in algorithm 1 in this algorithm libsvm is used as an svm tool to train the surrogate model chang and lin 2011 the model training parameters like s t bestc bestg p v and the introduction of functions like svmcgforregress libsvmtrain and libsvmpredict can be found in chang and lin 2011 this algorithm mainly includes three parts the first part is modelling line 2 6 the thrust of all thrusters is the model input and the positioning capability as defined by cri above is the model output ml is employed to construct a surrogate model between the model input and output the second part is resampling line 6 7 unconditional sampling is used to generate unconditional samples pawn sampling is used to gain conditional samples the last part is sensitivity index computation line 9 10 the pawn indices of all thrusters are computed by pawn index its function is shown in line 11 17 line 12 13 is to calculate the unconditional output and conditional output line 14 16 is to compute the pawn index using eq 5 detailed computing process could be found in pianosi and wagener 2018 the introduction of parameters and functions regarding pawn method can be found in pianosi et al 2015 image 1 4 case study 4 1 an optimal ml selection based on ishigami function in order to find an optimal modeling method first of all three prevalent ml methods such as back propagation bp regularized extreme learning machine relm and svm are introduced into training models wang et al 2018b cui and jing 2019 shao and er 2016 next pawn combined with these three models is used to compute sensitivity indices of three parameters of ishigami function finally sa results are compared with a benchmark to identify the optimal ml method for analyzing the significance of thrusters in the course of determining an optimal ml method ishigami function is selected as a mathematical model because ishigami is a widely used benchmark model that is applied to test the validity of sensitivity analysis method pianosi and wagener 2015 it is shown in eq 6 6 y s i n χ 1 a s i n χ 2 2 b χ 3 4 s i n χ 1 where a and b are random constants that can influence the sensitivity index of χ i i 1 2 3 χ i follows a uniform distribution over π π here we set a 2 and b 1 fig 4 displays sa results as well as benchmark value the dotted line is the benchmark value of sensitivity indices of the three parameters χ i in eq 6 the corresponding sensitivity indices are s1 0 53 s2 0 19 and s3 0 35 respectively it is evident that both bp and relm cannot figure sensitivity index out correctly whereas pawn combined with svm has a better approximation to the benchmark therefore svm is selected as modelling method in the follow up sensitivity analysis of thrusters in different scenarios 4 2 experimental design this significance analysis of thrusters is conducted to determine the variation of positioning capability apportioned to each thruster the specifications of the vessel are listed in table 2 this vessel is actuated by six thrusters shown in fig 3 the actuator forces relate to the control forces and moments by τ t ξ f w h e r e ξ ξ 1 ξ p ℝ p is a vector of azimuth angles and t ξ is the thrust configuration matrix fossen 2011 in this paper ξ is fixed in order to obtain the demanded thrust for each thruster an unconstrained least squares ls optimization problem is constructed through using lagrange multipliers to solve ls optimization problem we can obtain f t τ where t w 1 t t w 1 t 1 is recognized as the generalized inverse gi matrix here w is a positive definite matrix weighting the control forces the detailed reasoning process has been interpreted in fossen 2011 the attack angles α is set as 45 90 135 for different scenarios the direction of current and wave is fixed for simplifying the experiment the limits of ship position and heading are set as r 3m and θ 6 respectively table 4 lists four different combinations of sea states and attack angle they are strong breeze 45 strong breeze 90 strong breeze 135 and fresh breeze 45 for strong breeze 45 there are seven different thruster failure modes represented by binary string 011111 101111 110111 111011 111101 111110 110110 here 0 denotes the thruster is malfunctioning 1 denotes the thruster is working normally for example 101111 indicates the second thruster is malfunctioning while the others are working normally the required parameters of ship states are listed in the table 3 the sampling frequency is set as 20hz the synthesized criterion involves specifying three weighting factors ω 1 ω 2 and ω 3 in this study we set ω 1 0 5 ω 2 0 4 and ω 3 0 1 based on the following reasons on the one hand since dp vessels are designed with the redundant power system in general 20 of power will be reserved to avoid loss of position occurrence that indicates the power is sufficient to keep a vessel s position and heading during dp operations therefore power utilization was considered the least important factor in the criterion on the other hand ship position is seen as the most significant factor because the loss of position brings a more considerable detrimental impact on dp operations than heading for pawn n is set to 10 based on the samples of data as well as experience as described in other papers wang et al 2018b pianosi and wagener 2018 in this paper the experiment investigates the significance of thrusters under circumstances of different thruster failures in two sea states using the proposed method for timely computation of thrusters sensitivity is studied as well 4 3 significance analysis in different thruster failure modes at two sea states this section mainly analyzes and compares sa results in different environmental factors and thruster conditions table 5 lists the sa results of thruster failures at the strong breeze and fresh breeze sea states it is found that thruster 5 is more significant than the rest of thrusters in most cases its contribution accounts for around 30 40 especially when thruster 6 fails to work the significance of thruster 5 exceeds 35 because thruster 5 as the only main propeller must generate much more thrust to counteract the influence of environmental disturbances when one thruster failure occurs the significance of thrusters that play a complementary role will have a significant increase as shown in table 5 for example the pawn index of thruster 6 increases from 8 to 30 when thruster 5 fails in strong breeze 45 the same happens to thruster 1 and 2 for the case of 101111 in strong breeze 45 for instance the significance of thruster 1 rises by 13 up to 26 42 for dual thruster failure 110110 in all sea states at least two of tunnel thrusters significance go up to over 20 compared with one thruster failure that possibly results from the drastic variation of the ship heading it is reflected from the above analysis that the significance of thrusters depends on the conjunction of sea states wind direction as well as thruster failures next significance analysis of thrusters is carried out in detail from the respect of statistics and sa in order to illustrate how to do analysis by sa coupled with statistical analysis we will use 111111 in the case of strong breeze with an attack angle 45 as an example for the case of 111111 in strong breeze 45 an average of thrust and sa results are shown in fig 5 the left y axis represents the pawn index of each thruster while the right one denotes mean value of thrust these two analysis methods are able to show the importance of thrusters from their own perspective in addition there are interior connections between these two methods the results of sa show that the order of importance of thrusters is quite as similar as that of statistical analysis the pawn index shows that thruster 5 has the most influential effect on positioning capability at 29 76 the second largest effect is thruster 4 accounting for roughly 22 46 thrusters 3 1 2 and 6 follow in that order thruster 6 makes only an 8 17 contribution to the station keeping ability of dp vessel despite its similarities to thruster 5 which makes the largest contribution however these two methods show some distinctions such as inconsistency of sa results with statistical analysis for thruster 6 from the perspective of statistics thruster 6 has as much thrust as thruster 5 as shown in fig 6 the mean and variance of thrust generated by thruster 5 are the same as those generated by thruster 6 the two thrusters also consume the same amount of power and have similar statistical features but observing results obtained by the proposed sa method in fig 5 in which all sa indices are drawn as blue bars shows that thruster 6 is far less significant than thruster 5 it is even less than thruster 2 it reveals that sa results do not entirely conform with results obtained by statistical analysis both methods did give us insights that thruster 6 consumed amounts of power but generated too much useless force in this case to obtain more insights from fig 5 thrusters 4 and 6 are for detailed investigation fig 7 displays the pdf of power consumed by thrusters 4 and 6 respectively the power consumed mostly appears in the interval 100 kw 600 kw which is far less than the power consumed by thruster 6 as shown in the blue area moreover the mean of thrust generated by thruster 4 is far less than that generated by thruster 6 based on figs 5 and 7 we can find that thruster 6 consumed more power and generated more thrust but less contribution than thruster 4 through sa and statistical analysis it is definitely found that some thrusters have fewer influences on dp capability although they consumed more power that results in a waste of power therefore significance results could be used to provide guidance to improve the power allocation algorithm for example sensitivity indices as weighting factors are added into the algorithm in this case thruster 6 with high power consumption but a little contribution to dp capability will be reallocated less power by the power system instead more power should be redistributed to thruster 4 which could improve dp capability with low power consumption 4 4 real time computation of thrusters sensitivity although the existing method is efficient to analyze the thrusters significance in xu et al 2015 it is not competent in the real time computation of thrusters sensitivity this section is to verify the feasibility of the proposed method in estimating thrusters sensitivity online a simulation experiment is carried out when thruster state changes from 111111 to 011111 in strong breeze 45 the thrust generated by thrusters is shown in fig 8 red dotted line represents the point at which thruster 1 fails to work in order to visualize each curve clearly multiple shifts of 80 kn along the y axis direction is performed for thruster 2 6 in fact the value of the thrust of all thrusters starts from 0 fig 9 shows the variation of sensitivity indices of thrusters over time the horizontal axis denotes sensitivity index is computed at a window time of 25s that comprises 500 sample points evidently the proposed method is able to gain the contribution of each thruster to the dp capability in the process of vessel counteracting against environmental forces especially when thruster 1 shuts down at 650s depicted by a red circle the importance of thruster 1 becomes 0 thereafter on the other hand thruster 2 plays a more and more important role since this point this is because thruster 1 and 2 are bow thrusters as shown in fig 3 the malfunction of thruster 1 leads to the rise of thruster 2 importance in the long term in addition the importance of other thrusters rises to some extent as well after thruster 1 fails to work at the point of 650s the detailed information can be found in the fig 10 from this figure the importance of thruster 2 and 4 grow rapidly compared with other thrusters therefore the instant change of the indices could provide the operator evidence to improve the power consuming of thruster 2 and 4 to promote the dp capability quickly after the failure of thruster 1 to sum up the proposed method is capable of finding the contribution of all thrusters in a real time manner 4 5 discussion for the case of 111111 in strong breeze 45 in fig 6 the discrepancy in terms of power and thrust between thruster 5 and 6 possibly results from the fact that the rudder angle of main thrusters is fixed as shown in fig 3 in order to resist the wind whose attack angle is 45 thruster 5 must bear much more load than thruster 6 therefore the power and thrust of thruster 5 vary more drastically compared with those of thruster 6 it can be shown from the above analysis that thruster s importance is affected by a synthesized factor including the configuration of thrusters the attack angle of sea states and the thrust allocation algorithm in fig 4 the result of bp and elm is not as ideal as that of svm this situation mainly results from the limited training sample on account of online significance analysis considering the requirement of on board support therefore svm is used for the real time estimation of sensitivity indices since the sensitivity index computed by svm can converge to a stable value after 500 training samples we chose a window time of 25s corresponding to 500 training samples under the sampling frequency of 20hz in section 4 4 6 conclusion this paper proposes a method that mainly focuses on studying the significance of thrusters based on a synthesized positioning capability criterion in different thruster failure conditions in order to quantify the dp capability a synthesized assessment criterion is proposed by integrating ship position heading and power next the ishigami function is used as a benchmark to determine an optimal modelling method through the comparison with ann and elm svm is selected to construct a surrogate model between thrusters and dp capability finally different thruster failure cases in two sea states are designed to elaborate on how statistical features and sa are combined to quantify and analyze the significance of thrusters the purpose of significance analysis results is as follows 1 they can provide onboard support to control power system to allocate more power to the most significant thruster when thruster fails to work which contributes to efficiently improving dp capability 2 they also can be used to provide guidance to optimize power allocation by observing statistics of power and sensitivity results thrusters that consumed more power but made much less contribution to positioning capability should be reallocated less power this is able to be accomplished by for example adding sensitivity indices as weighting factors into the allocation algorithm that is helpful to improve vessel s dp capability with less power consumption for future work efforts will be put on investigating the impact of azimuth thrusters and the thrust allocation logic on the significance of thrusters in dp

21017,for the large scale development and large opening characteristics of container ships the characteristics of springing in waves has become more complex it is thus urgent to find reasonable equivalent principles to solve the dilemma of simultaneously simulating vertical horizontal and torsional vibrations in model tests meanwhile to avoid the complexity and time consuming nature of full three dimensional modelling a large scale combined beam model is adopted to simulate three dimensional coupled vibrations and the positions of the neutral axis and torsion centre combined with the finite element method a 3d equivalent modelling method of the combined model is analysed in detail and the stiffness influence of transverse bulkheads on the coupled vibrations mode is revealed furthermore the elastic modal responses vibration principles and waves load in the fluid structure interaction vibrations are assessed and investigated by the three dimensional linear hydroelastic mechanics method in the frequency and time domains then the scheme and load measurement method in the model test in the wave basin are put forward and the experimental data and numerical calculation results are compared and found to be consistent the proposed the equivalent combined beam model is of great significance for model tests and numerical analyses of very large container ships keywords combined backbone springing model test hydroelasticity container ship 1 introduction in recent years the loading capacity of container ships has increased to 20 000 teu twenty foot equivalent unit and the ship length has reached to 400 m with the development of large scale container ships with characteristic large openings the overall vibration frequency is becoming increasingly lower this can easily cause wave induced vibration also called springing in ocean waves which leads to great challenges with respect to structural safety many scholars have conducted substantial research on the characteristics wave loads springing and whipping of container ships senjanović et al 2014 hirdaris et al 2016 kim et al 2016 rajendran et al 2016 chen et al 2017 a full 3d fem model was built for hydroelastic calculations including nonlinear whipping and the results were applied to extreme loads and fatigue assessment im h et al 2017 the characteristic structural stiffness and large openings of container ships determine that the fluid structural vibration response characteristics in waves are different from those in bulk carriers oil tankers and lng carriers the complex experimental method and finite element equivalent modelling have been prominent research topics in recent years zhu et al 2011 zhao et al 2017 lin et al 2020 wang et al 2018 houtani et al 2018 lin et al 2020 to simulate the profile characteristics of large openings in model tests the vertical horizontal torsional stiffness and shear centre of the backbone are simultaneously satisfied by model design in a wave basin zhu et al 2011 as shown in fig 1 zhao et al 2017 lin et al 2020 as shown in fig 2 wang et al 2018 as shown in fig 3 and houtani et al 2018 as shown in fig 4 the beam model consists of 15 box shaped segments with an aluminium material on the top zhu et al 2011 however although the wave loads at seven sections were measured through strain gauges including vertical shear force vsf vertical bending moment vbm horizontal bending moment hbm and torsional moment tm the vibration characteristics of vertical bending horizontal bending and torsion could not be simultaneously simulated however there is no detailed equivalent modelling principle or numerical calculation of wave load and hydroelasticity lin et al 2020 or only the vertical and torsional vibration characteristics are simulated houtani et al 2018 wang et al 2018 there are currently few model tests or numerical analyses adopting large scale combined backbones that simultaneously simulate vertical bending vibration horizontal bending vibration and torsional vibration especially for large opening ships the torsional stiffness and natural frequencies are relatively low and the coupled phenomenon of horizontal vibration and torsional vibration may occur in addition when u shaped backbones are used to simulate these three types of coupled vibrations either they are not simulated at the same time such as houtani et al 2018 wang et al 2018 or there are a few segments which cannot accurately simulate the higher order vibration wang et al 2018 or the small scale u shaped beam rajendran and guedes soares 2016 cannot simultaneously simulate the vertical bending vibration the horizontal bending vibration of inertia of each ship hull section the torsional vibration of inertia of each ship hull section and the positions of the torsion centre and neutral axis and it cannot reflect the shear effect and short thick beam effect i e the timoshenko beam effect thus the model test and numerical calculation of a 20 000 teu container ship will be determined in this paper aimed at deepening the application of a combined backbone and the model test and equivalent simulation law of the combined 3d fem will be analysed in detail based on the three dimensional hydroelasticity and wave load calculation methods in the frequency and time domains the resonant frequencies modal responses and wave loading law are investigated and analysed using in house software such as the forward speed correction method fscm yang et al 2020 and the rankine source method iorm yang 2016 finally a multi segment model test of the wave load is conducted in a wave basin and the experimental data and numerical analysis results are compared and verified the research in this paper will provide reliable technical support for the complex simulation of a wave load and hydroelastic mechanics in a model test and finite element equivalent simulations 2 fundamental theory and mathematical formulation of hydroelasticity and wave loads 2 1 basic assumption and definition the fluid field around an elastic ship hull is usually assumed to be uniform incompressible non viscous and non rotating when studying wave structure interaction problems meanwhile the effects of the lift force and surface tension are not considered on the other hand the elastic deformation of the structure is considered to be small and the overall responses satisfy the linear superposition principle of modal deformation the ships travel with a constant forward speed u 0 the definition of wave direction β is shown in fig 5 and 0 and 180 denote the following sea and heading sea respectively it is assumed that the motions and distortions of the floating structure in waves are small and the dynamic responses of entire fluid structure system are linear the translational displacement u and rotation θ at any position of the ship structure can be expressed as the superposition of displacements of principal modes then the structural

velocity of the steady flow relative to the moving equilibrium frame of reference for a slender thin flat or a slowly moving body such as the displacement of mono hull ships it is simplified as w u 0

1 are very close to the parameters and characteristics of the 19 000 teu container ship hong ll et al 2016 the full loading condition is the main case in daily operations so the study in this paper mainly focuses on the full load additionally the mass distributions of the full load and ballast are shown in fig 7 3 2 similarity law of wave loads and hydroelasticity the ship model designs meet the principles of geometric similarity kinematic similarity and dynamic similarity the main similarity relations are also shown in table 2 and the details are as follows dai et al 2007 a the shape of the ship model is similar to that of a real full scale ship b the longitudinal transversal and vertical weight distributions of the ship model and the real full scale ship and the second moment or circular radius about the centre of gravity are similar c the vibration frequencies and the modal shapes of the vertical bending vibration modes are similar and d the froude number strouhal number and wave parameters are similar froude number 14a f r v m g l m v s g l s where g denotes gravity acceleration v s and l s denote the velocity and length of the full scale ship respectively and v m and l m denote the velocity and length of the ship in the model test respectively strouhal number 14b s t v m t m l m v s t s l s where t m and t s denote the time of the full scale ship and scale ship respectively the ship hull is simplified as a 1d continuous beam model for traditional structural vibration simulation in model tests of wave loads and hydroelasticity in which the effects of shear and damping are not taken into account the differential equations of the forced vibration of a ship hull are as follows vertical bending vibration 15a e i y y 4 d z x 4 m x 2 d z t 2 p z x t horizontal bending vibration 15b e i z z 4 d y x 4 m x 2 d y t 2 p y x t torsional bending vibration only the circle section 15c g j x 2 θ x 2 i x x 2 θ t 2 t x x t where t denotes time e and g denote the young s modulus and shear modulus respectively i y y and i z z denote the inertia of the section about the y axis and z axis respectively and j x denotes the polar inertia about the x axis m x and i x x denote the line density of mass and the polar inertia of mass respectively d y and d z denote displacements along y axis and z axis respectively and θ denotes the torsional angle p y and p z denote the external exiting forces along the y axis and z axis respectively and t x denotes the external exiting torque about the x axis however real ship structures do not have circle sections so there are coupled vibrations of vertical bending horizontal bending and torsional bending thus a beam with a circle section cannot be applied to simulate the actual coupled vibration of a ship hull furthermore although a 1d beam with an i or u section can simulate the coupled vibration of these three modes it is impossible to simultaneously meet the vertical bending vibration horizontal bending vibration of inertia of each ship hull section torsional vibration of inertia of each ship hull section and the positions of the torsion centre and neutral axis this is the reason the combined beam model is proposed as shown in fig 8 b in which the hydrodynamic pressures are transferred by the ship hull and the combined beam in the ship hull is designed to meet the structural vibration characteristics and suffer wave loads 3 3 model design in a tank the scale ratio of the model is 1 77 the model test of the heading seas and oblique seas were conducted in a seakeeping basin in 2019 in the model test the ship hull is divided into seven sections which are mainly made of glass fibre reinforced plastic frp as shown in fig 8 a after the ship hull is cut the membrane latex seal is used to prevent water leakage therefore there is no load transfer or bearing among the sections of the ship hull and all the external loads are borne by the backbone which runs through the inside of the hull abs acrylonitrile butadiene styrene resin was used to simulate the vertical vibration stiffness horizontal vibration stiffness and torsional vibration stiffness of the u shaped backbone as shown in fig 8 b the poisson s ratio is 0 398 the young s modulus e is 2 41 gpa and the shear modulus g is 0 86 gpa the mass centre of gravity and moment of inertia are simulated simultaneously by means of weight distribution the forward direction of the ship is controlled by an electric propeller installed at the stern and an adaptive steering system in the model test there are 16 plates ① ⑯ on each section and 27 strain gauges are arranged to measure the vertical bending moment horizontal bending moment and torque as shown in fig 9 image 1 and image 2 indicate 45 degree shear strain gauges the torque is measured by these 24 strain gauges which are respectively pasted on the inside and outside of the plates and all the shear strain gauges are pasted in the middle of each plate a half bridge is formed by the symmetric strain gauges for the image 3 strain gauges of the closed box body such as the 7 plate and 15 plate and the half bridge is composed of the image 4 strain gauges outside the plates and the image 5 strain gauges inside the plates for the opening part there are four tension and compression strain gauges on each section denoted as image 6 the vertical bending moment is measured by the tension and compression strain gauge between the 1 plate and 9 plate the tension and compression strain gauges on the 2 plate and 10 plate form a half bridge to measure the horizontal bending moments the formulas of the vertical bending moment horizontal bending moment and torsional moment are as follows 16a m y i y y σ 1 9 z n 16b m z σ 2 σ 10 2 i z z b 1 16c t x i 1 16 τ i t i h i where z n denotes the height of the neutral axis τ i denotes the shear stress of each measured point and t i and h i denote the thickness of each element and the arm of force about the neutral axis or torsion centre based on the design drawing of object ship structures the object structural characteristics of the ship sections are assessed as shown in table 3 meanwhile the corresponding young s modulus and shear modulus are 2 06 10 11 gpa and 7 92 10 10 gpa respectively in the simulation of the model test for the complex u shaped backbone it is very difficult to satisfy the characteristics of each section as shown in table 3 at the same time thus the u shaped variable cross section backbone of the three parts are adopted in the model test and the dimensional parameters are listed in table 4 and table 5 meanwhile the shapes of station 5 and 10 are the same moreover the structural characteristics of the backbone of the three sections are shown in table 6 which correspond to stations 5 10 and 15 the positions of the neutral axis and shear centre in the table are relative to the baseline of the ship hull additionally the bottom of the backbone at station 10 and station 5 or 15 are above the baseline by 1 2 m and 3 9 m respectively due to the difficulty of simultaneously meeting the vertical bending moment of inertia the horizontal bending moment of inertia the torsion pole moment of inertia the neutral axis and the torsional centre or shear centre the parameters of the final u shaped combined backbone are slightly different from the actual backbone but the error is less than 10 for sections 5 10 and 15 except the torsional centre height of sections 5 and 15 as shown in table 7 the parameters of the numerical model are same to that of the experimental model in a wave tank the wave loads and springing are measured for the heading sea and oblique seas 120 and 150 under full load and ballast load cases including regular waves and irregular waves the overall appearance of the experiment model and wave scenario are shown in fig 10 3 4 experimental results of the resonant frequencies in the model test the time domain history of the dynamic attenuation vibrations of the vertical bending moments on the backbone are obtained via a hammering test in still water as shown in fig 11 a and fig 12 a the amplitude frequency diagrams are obtained via fourier transform as shown in figs 11 b and fig 12 b in fig 11 there are three peaks of the vertical bending moment under full load conditions two node vertical bending vibration 3 69 hz three node vertical bending vibration 8 31 hz and four node vertical bending vibration 14 19 hz for full scale the three frequencies are 2 64 rad s 5 91 rad s and 10 16 rad s respectively in fig 12 there are three peaks of the vertical bending moment under ballast conditions two node vertical bending vibration 5 08 hz three node vertical bending vibration 10 40 hz and four node vertical bending vibration 16 67 hz for full scale the frequencies are 3 64 rad s 7 45 rad s and 12 00 rad s respectively 4 numerical and experimental result analysis 4 1 hydrodynamic model because the ship hull is symmetrical about the x z plane the half model can be used in the hydrodynamic calculation and the number of elements is 2045 including the element above the still water plane as shown in fig 13 a in the iorm method based on the internal and outer region matching the hull surface free surface and virtual control surface need to be meshed as shown in fig 13 b the number of elements on the control surface and free surface are 171 and 931 respectively the radius of the free surface is 2 times that of the ship length 4 2 dry structure modelling and modal analysis 4 2 1 structure modelling in the finite element method in the model test the fluid pressure acting on the ship hull needs to be transferred to the backbone through the transverse bulkhead performing the fluid structural interaction analysis requires obtaining the modal displacement information of the ship hull in the numerical calculation in addition the global vibration shapes are determined by the stiffness of each section of the backbone and the mass distribution and the ship hull does not need to play the role of mass and stiffness effects the backbone plays the role of transferring the mode shape from the backbone to ship hull the three dimensional model consists of four parts the combined backbone ship hull bulkhead and mass points the details of the modelling are as follows i the complex combined backbone model which plays the role of structural strength support consists of many plates such as 16 plates for the containership in this paper the properties of the finite element model are e 186 gpa poisson ratio μ 0 398 and density is zero the 3d fem model of the combined backbone model is composed of 15188 shell elements as shown in fig 14 a and the plate thickness and size are set according to tables 4 and 5 ii the ship hull plays the role of no structural support and no mass effects so the density of the ship hull in the numerical prediction is zero meanwhile the young s modulus of the ship hull is also not zero but is very small to avoid local pseudo vibration mode the properties of the finite element model are e 0 01 gpa poisson ratio μ 0 398 and the density is zero the 3d fem model of ship hull is composed of 20549 shell elements as shown in fig 14 b the thickness of the plates 1 m is an empirical value combined with e 0 01 gpa to avoid a local pseudo vibration mode iii the bulkheads play the role of structural support connect the ship hull and backbone and transfer modal shapes from the backbone to the ship hull the thickness and stiffness of the bulkheads have effects on the natural frequencies of torsional bending modes and the thickness of the plate with a 0 7 m bulkhead is an empirical value after various numerical calculations by controlling the natural frequency of one node torsional bending of the combined backbone model to the same as that of the object ship the stiffness of the bulkhead directly affects the overall modal shapes and natural frequencies the properties of the finite element model are e 206 gpa poisson ratio μ 0 3 and density is zero the 3d fem model of the bulkhead is composed of 15658 shell elements as shown in fig 14 c iv the ship weight is simulated by 42 mass points and the weight distribution is symmetrical about the x z plane the element size of the entire model is approximately 1 5 m and the total number of shell elements is 51446 the combined 3d fem model is shown in fig 14 d 4 2 2 modal shapes and frequencies of the 3d fem model figs 15 20 show the dry natural vibration modes of the first six orders by the combined 3d fem model and the corresponding natural frequencies are listed in table 8 the results in the figures indicate that i the shear centre of the torsional modes in the figures is at approximately 16 m which is above the baseline but the shear centre of the midship section is 19 4 m which is shown in tables 3 and 6 ii the horizontal modes are all coupled with torsional modes and some studies shin et al 2015 peng et al 2019 have found the same phenomenon meanwhile the natural frequencies of the coupled modes are smaller than that of the single horizontal modes listed in fig 22 b d and f in contrast the modal shapes are very different to the other floating structures without large openings on the main decks such as the bulk carrier yang et al 2019 and barge yang et al 2020 in which the horizontal bending modes are not coupled with the torsional modes see fig 23 the 3d fem model actual peng et al 2019 in table 8 denotes the actual full 3d finite element model which is built by a detailed design drawing and is time consuming the errors of dry natural frequencies between the combined 3d fem model in this paper and the actual 3d fem model are less than 7 1 except for the one node torsional bending mode which is 12 6 and for the four node coupled mode which is 11 3 the error levels are acceptable for the concurrent simulation of the vertical bending vibration horizontal bending vibration and torsional vibration on the other side the ship hull and combined backbone are connected by rigid transversal frames in the model test in a seakeeping basin to simulate a real case in the experiments when the bulkhead is close to rigid the thickness of the bulkhead is recognised as 1 m in the combined 3d fem model the results of the dry natural frequencies of the finite element model become larger as shown in table 9 which indicates that the natural frequencies of the torsional modes and coupled modes of the torsional vibration and horizontal bending vibration are obviously increased for vertical bending modes the increase is 1 4 for torsional modes and coupled modes the increase is 14 39 and the frequencies of the modes are lower so the increase is even larger in the model test like that shown in fig 1 a the ship model is suspended by a number of low stiffness springs on the both sides of the deck and then the dry natural frequency of the hull structure can be obtained through the hammering test in which the dry natural frequency of the one node torsion mode is 2 76 rad s which is very consistent with the numerical calculation result 2 73 rad s in table 9 in the 3d fem model therefore the transverse frame is too rigid in the model test which makes the torsional mode deviate from the true 3d fem model however in the model test the accurate simulation of the stiffness of the transversal frame is too difficult and heavy work which will be taken into account in future research 4 2 3 modal shapes and frequencies of the 1d beam to investigate the principle and feasibility of a 1d beam a 1d straight euler bernoulli beam bauchau and craig 2009 which ignores the shear effect is composed with seven segments with parameters based on table 3 in order to simultaneously simulate vertical bending and horizontal bending vibration with the dimensions of each segment listed in table 10 each section of every segment is a rectangle as shown in fig 21 the material is steel and the young s modulus e 2 06 gpa and the poisson ratio μ 0 3 the fem model of the 1d beam consists of 100 beam elements in patran nastran the elastic vibration modes of the first six orders are shown in fig 22 and the corresponding natural frequencies are listed in table 11 it can be seen that the natural frequencies of the three node vertical bending mode are different from the actual 3d mode with a 20 error and cannot be accurately simulated even if the variable cross section steel beam of seven segments is adopted the reason for this is that the slender beam theory or euler bernoulli beam theory is no longer suitable for 3d hull vibration simulation in these cases thus the timoshenko beam theory elishakoff 2020 should be used to simulate the short and thick beam to consider the shear deformation of the section the theoretical study shows that the additional deformation mechanism of the timoshenko beam theory can effectively reduce the stiffness of beam that is to say the general euler bernoulli beam theory overestimates the natural frequencies this is confirmed by the numerical calculation results in this paper the results predicted by the general euler bernoulli beam theory are larger than those by the 3d fem model in table 11 4 2 4 modal shapes of the 3d fem model and the beam model under ballast conditions the mass distribution under a ballast load is smaller than that under a full load but the structural characteristics are the same in light of the similarities between the structural vibration modes of the container ship under a ballast and full load the horizontal bending mode is coupled with the torsional mode and the difference is that the resonance frequency of the four nodes is less than the vertical vibration of three node bending due to the similarities with the full load and limited space this paper only lists the dry modes see figs 23 24 25 26 27 28 and 29 natural frequencies and wet resonance frequencies see table 12 of the ballast condition under which the specific results will not be discussed further the sequence of the modal shapes is the same as the results of a 19 000 teu container ship im h et al 2017 however for a 13 000 teu container ship the full three dimensional finite element method was used to calculate the modal vibration mode and dry frequency under ballast conditions and the numerical results show that there are no coupled vibrations chen et al 2019 the reason may be that the structural characteristics of the 13 000 teu container ship are different from the 20 000 teu container ship in this paper 4 3 modal response analysis the viscous coefficients of the elastic modes are 1 in the calculation of the structural modal responses and wave loads the results of the modal response transfer function obtained by the fscm and iorm methods are shown in fig 30 and fig 33 where the abscissa denotes the encountering frequency in waves figs 30 and 31 a fig 32 a and fig 33 a show the transfer functions of the vertical bending vibration modal responses the results indicate that in addition to the peak value of the principal component of the wave force there are significant two node resonant points and three node resonant points in the high frequency band figs 31 b fig 32 b and fig 33 b show the response transfer functions of torsional vibration and its coupled vibration modes with horizontal bending the results indicate that there are four resonant points in the high frequency band which are one node torsion the two node coupled mode the three node coupled mode and the four node coupled mode the numerical results in tables 13 16 show that compared with the dry mode vibration in a vacuum the added mass effect of the fluid makes the resonant frequency of the vertical bending vibration decrease obviously and the influence on torsional vibration and coupled vibration with horizontal bending is weak in addition the resonant frequencies of the two node vertical bending vibration calculated by the 1d beam model are in good agreement with the model test results but the errors of the resonant frequencies of the three node vertical bending are larger compared with the results of the 3d fem model the reason is that the slender beam theory or euler bernoulli beam theory is no longer suitable for 3d hull vibration simulation in these cases 4 4 wave loading analysis after calculating the modal responses the transfer functions of the vertical bending moment horizontal bending moment and torsional moment are obtained via fluid pressure integral method in figs 34 40 a b and l denote the wave amplitude breadth and length of the floating structures g denotes the acceleration of gravity and wm model test denotes the experimental results of wave frequency components the results indicate that the numerical results are well consistent with the experimental data except for the experimental peaks of the torsional moment in an heading oblique sea of 150 and the horizontal bending moment in an oblique sea heading of 120 because the wave maker cannot produce very short waves in the model test in a seakeeping basin there are no experimental results in the high frequency band on the other side during the nondimensional wave the frequencies ω e l g are less than 40 and there are some resonant peaks at a high frequency band for vertical bending moment and torsional moments due to elastic resonant vibration of the floating structures in the fluid except for the horizontal bending moment responses 5 conclusions to simultaneously simulate vertical bending vibration horizontal bending vibration and torsional vibration in model tests in a wave basin the vibration characteristics of a combined backbone model were analysed by the three dimensional finite element method and the finite element modelling method of the 3d combined backbone model was studied then a multi segmented model test scheme was proposed as was a new arrangement of strain gauges to be used in the model test finally the resonant frequencies modal responses and wave loads of the 20 000 teu container ship in waves were evaluated by the fluid structure interaction method of three dimensional hydroelasticity some important conclusions are as follows 1 to avoid the complexity of full three dimensional structure modelling one combined model is proposed the stiffness of the transverse bulkhead has a great influence on the torsional vibration mode when the coupled vibration characteristics of bending and torsion are evaluated by the combined model this should be given more attention in numerical simulations and model tests 2 the natural frequencies of the three node vertical bending mode are different from the actual 3d mode with a 20 error and would overestimate the frequencies even if the variable cross section steel beam of seven segments is adopted the reason is that the slender beam theory or euler bernoulli beam theory is no longer suitable for 3d hull vibration simulations in these cases moreover the combined backbone model can not only accurately simulate the vibration modes and natural frequencies of the vertical bending vibration horizontal bending vibration and torsional vibration but also simplify and reduce the workload in numerical modelling compared with full 3d fem modelling the equivalence principles to simultaneously simulate vertical vibration horizontal vibration and torsional vibration in the model test and numerical assessment of hydroelasticity are proposed 3 for a container ship with a large opening the torsional vibration mode is often coupled with horizontal bending vibration where the first vibration is torsional vibration rather than the conventional vertical bending vibration of two nodes additionally an added mass effect of fluid makes the resonant frequency of the vertical bending vibration decrease obviously and the influence on the torsional vibration and vibration coupled with horizontal bending is weak 4 the numerical simulation method of hydroelasticity and the combined model proposed in this paper can accurately predict the vibration characteristics and wave loads of container ships in the fluid which are in good agreement with the experimental data during the nondimensional wave the frequencies ω e l g are smaller than 40 except for the horizontal bending moment responses and there are some resonant peaks at the high frequency band for the vertical bending moment and torsional moments due to the elastic resonant vibration of the floating structures in the fluid 5 real experiences have demonstrated that an engineer spends one to two months on modelling a detailed full 3d fem model of one ship but no more than a week on a 3d fem model of a combined backbone thus the 3d fem model of a combined backbone can save costs credit authorship contribution statement peng yang conceptualization methodology

21017,for the large scale development and large opening characteristics of container ships the characteristics of springing in waves has become more complex it is thus urgent to find reasonable equivalent principles to solve the dilemma of simultaneously simulating vertical horizontal and torsional vibrations in model tests meanwhile to avoid the complexity and time consuming nature of full three dimensional modelling a large scale combined beam model is adopted to simulate three dimensional coupled vibrations and the positions of the neutral axis and torsion centre combined with the finite element method a 3d equivalent modelling method of the combined model is analysed in detail and the stiffness influence of transverse bulkheads on the coupled vibrations mode is revealed furthermore the elastic modal responses vibration principles and waves load in the fluid structure interaction vibrations are assessed and investigated by the three dimensional linear hydroelastic mechanics method in the frequency and time domains then the scheme and load measurement method in the model test in the wave basin are put forward and the experimental data and numerical calculation results are compared and found to be consistent the proposed the equivalent combined beam model is of great significance for model tests and numerical analyses of very large container ships keywords combined backbone springing model test hydroelasticity container ship 1 introduction in recent years the loading capacity of container ships has increased to 20 000 teu twenty foot equivalent unit and the ship length has reached to 400 m with the development of large scale container ships with characteristic large openings the overall vibration frequency is becoming increasingly lower this can easily cause wave induced vibration also called springing in ocean waves which leads to great challenges with respect to structural safety many scholars have conducted substantial research on the characteristics wave loads springing and whipping of container ships senjanović et al 2014 hirdaris et al 2016 kim et al 2016 rajendran et al 2016 chen et al 2017 a full 3d fem model was built for hydroelastic calculations including nonlinear whipping and the results were applied to extreme loads and fatigue assessment im h et al 2017 the characteristic structural stiffness and large openings of container ships determine that the fluid structural vibration response characteristics in waves are different from those in bulk carriers oil tankers and lng carriers the complex experimental method and finite element equivalent modelling have been prominent research topics in recent years zhu et al 2011 zhao et al 2017 lin et al 2020 wang et al 2018 houtani et al 2018 lin et al 2020 to simulate the profile characteristics of large openings in model tests the vertical horizontal torsional stiffness and shear centre of the backbone are simultaneously satisfied by model design in a wave basin zhu et al 2011 as shown in fig 1 zhao et al 2017 lin et al 2020 as shown in fig 2 wang et al 2018 as shown in fig 3 and houtani et al 2018 as shown in fig 4 the beam model consists of 15 box shaped segments with an aluminium material on the top zhu et al 2011 however although the wave loads at seven sections were measured through strain gauges including vertical shear force vsf vertical bending moment vbm horizontal bending moment hbm and torsional moment tm the vibration characteristics of vertical bending horizontal bending and torsion could not be simultaneously simulated however there is no detailed equivalent modelling principle or numerical calculation of wave load and hydroelasticity lin et al 2020 or only the vertical and torsional vibration characteristics are simulated houtani et al 2018 wang et al 2018 there are currently few model tests or numerical analyses adopting large scale combined backbones that simultaneously simulate vertical bending vibration horizontal bending vibration and torsional vibration especially for large opening ships the torsional stiffness and natural frequencies are relatively low and the coupled phenomenon of horizontal vibration and torsional vibration may occur in addition when u shaped backbones are used to simulate these three types of coupled vibrations either they are not simulated at the same time such as houtani et al 2018 wang et al 2018 or there are a few segments which cannot accurately simulate the higher order vibration wang et al 2018 or the small scale u shaped beam rajendran and guedes soares 2016 cannot simultaneously simulate the vertical bending vibration the horizontal bending vibration of inertia of each ship hull section the torsional vibration of inertia of each ship hull section and the positions of the torsion centre and neutral axis and it cannot reflect the shear effect and short thick beam effect i e the timoshenko beam effect thus the model test and numerical calculation of a 20 000 teu container ship will be determined in this paper aimed at deepening the application of a combined backbone and the model test and equivalent simulation law of the combined 3d fem will be analysed in detail based on the three dimensional hydroelasticity and wave load calculation methods in the frequency and time domains the resonant frequencies modal responses and wave loading law are investigated and analysed using in house software such as the forward speed correction method fscm yang et al 2020 and the rankine source method iorm yang 2016 finally a multi segment model test of the wave load is conducted in a wave basin and the experimental data and numerical analysis results are compared and verified the research in this paper will provide reliable technical support for the complex simulation of a wave load and hydroelastic mechanics in a model test and finite element equivalent simulations 2 fundamental theory and mathematical formulation of hydroelasticity and wave loads 2 1 basic assumption and definition the fluid field around an elastic ship hull is usually assumed to be uniform incompressible non viscous and non rotating when studying wave structure interaction problems meanwhile the effects of the lift force and surface tension are not considered on the other hand the elastic deformation of the structure is considered to be small and the overall responses satisfy the linear superposition principle of modal deformation the ships travel with a constant forward speed u 0 the definition of wave direction β is shown in fig 5 and 0 and 180 denote the following sea and heading sea respectively it is assumed that the motions and distortions of the floating structure in waves are small and the dynamic responses of entire fluid structure system are linear the translational displacement u and rotation θ at any position of the ship structure can be expressed as the superposition of displacements of principal modes then the structural

1 are very close to the parameters and characteristics of the 19 000 teu container ship hong ll et al 2016 the full loading condition is the main case in daily operations so the study in this paper mainly focuses on the full load additionally the mass distributions of the full load and ballast are shown in fig 7 3 2 similarity law of wave loads and hydroelasticity the ship model designs meet the principles of geometric similarity kinematic similarity and dynamic similarity the main similarity relations are also shown in table 2 and the details are as follows dai et al 2007 a the shape of the ship model is similar to that of a real full scale ship b the longitudinal transversal and vertical weight distributions of the ship model and the real full scale ship and the second moment or circular radius about the centre of gravity are similar c the vibration frequencies and the modal shapes of the vertical bending vibration modes are similar and d the froude number strouhal number and

respectively the ship hull is simplified as a 1d continuous beam model for traditional structural vibration simulation in model tests of wave loads and hydroelasticity in which the effects of shear and damping are not taken into account the differential equations of the forced vibration of a ship hull are as follows vertical bending vibration 15a e i y y 4 d z x 4 m x 2 d z t 2 p z x t horizontal bending vibration 15b e i z z 4 d y x 4 m x 2 d y t 2 p y x t torsional bending vibration only the circle section 15c g j x 2 θ x 2 i x x 2 θ t 2 t x x t where t denotes time e and g denote

denote the external exiting forces along the y axis and z axis respectively and t x denotes the external exiting torque about the x axis however real ship structures do not have circle sections so there are coupled vibrations of vertical bending horizontal bending and torsional bending thus a beam with a circle section cannot be applied to simulate the actual coupled vibration of a ship hull furthermore although a 1d beam with an i or u section can simulate the coupled vibration of these three modes it is impossible to simultaneously meet the vertical bending vibration horizontal bending vibration of inertia of each ship hull section torsional vibration of inertia of each ship hull section and the positions of the torsion centre and neutral axis this is the reason the combined beam model is proposed as shown in fig 8 b in which the hydrodynamic pressures are transferred by the ship hull and the combined beam in the ship hull is designed to meet the structural vibration characteristics and suffer wave loads 3 3 model design in a tank the scale ratio of the model is 1 77 the model test of the heading seas and oblique seas were conducted in a seakeeping basin in 2019 in the model test the ship hull is divided into seven sections which are mainly made of glass fibre reinforced plastic frp as shown in fig 8 a after the ship hull is cut the membrane latex seal is used to prevent water leakage therefore there is no load transfer or bearing among the sections of the ship hull and all the external loads are borne by the backbone which runs through the inside of the hull abs acrylonitrile butadiene styrene resin was used to simulate the vertical vibration stiffness horizontal vibration stiffness and torsional vibration stiffness of the u shaped backbone as shown in fig 8 b the poisson s ratio is 0 398 the young s modulus e is 2 41 gpa and the shear modulus g is 0 86 gpa the mass centre of gravity and moment of inertia are simulated simultaneously by means of weight distribution the forward direction of the ship is controlled by an electric propeller installed at the stern and an adaptive steering system in the model test there are 16 plates ① ⑯ on each section and 27 strain gauges are arranged to measure the vertical bending moment horizontal bending moment and torque as shown in fig 9 image 1 and image 2 indicate 45 degree shear strain gauges the torque is measured by these 24 strain gauges which are respectively pasted on the inside and outside of the plates and all the shear strain gauges are pasted in the middle of each plate a half bridge is formed by the symmetric strain gauges for the image 3 strain gauges of the closed box body such as the 7 plate and 15 plate and the half bridge is composed of the image 4 strain gauges outside the plates and the image 5 strain gauges inside the plates for the opening part there are four tension and compression strain gauges on each section denoted as image 6 the vertical bending moment is measured by the tension and compression strain gauge between the 1 plate and 9 plate the tension and compression strain gauges on the 2 plate and 10 plate form a half bridge to measure the horizontal bending moments the formulas of the vertical bending moment horizontal bending moment and torsional moment are as follows 16a m y i y y σ 1 9 z n 16b m z σ 2 σ 10 2 i z z b 1 16c t x i 1 16 τ i t i h i where z n denotes the height of the neutral axis τ i denotes the shear stress of each measured point and t i and h i denote the thickness of each element and the arm of force about the neutral axis or torsion centre based on the design drawing of object ship structures the object structural characteristics of the ship sections are assessed as shown in table 3 meanwhile the corresponding young s modulus and shear modulus are 2 06 10 11 gpa and 7 92 10 10 gpa respectively in the simulation of the model test for the complex u shaped backbone it is very difficult to satisfy the characteristics of each section as shown in table 3 at the same time thus the u shaped variable cross section backbone of the three parts are adopted in the model test and the dimensional parameters are listed in table 4 and table 5 meanwhile the shapes of station 5 and 10 are the same moreover the structural characteristics of the backbone of the three sections are shown in table 6 which correspond to stations 5 10 and 15 the positions of the neutral axis and shear centre in the table are relative to the baseline of the ship hull additionally the bottom of the backbone at station 10 and station 5 or 15 are above the baseline by 1 2 m and 3 9 m respectively due to the difficulty of simultaneously meeting the vertical bending moment of inertia the horizontal bending moment of inertia the torsion pole moment of inertia the neutral axis and the torsional centre or shear centre the parameters of the final u shaped combined backbone are slightly different from the actual backbone but the error is less than 10 for sections 5 10 and 15 except the torsional centre height of sections 5 and 15 as shown in table 7 the parameters of the numerical model are same to that of the experimental model in a wave tank the wave loads and springing are measured for the heading sea and oblique seas 120 and 150 under full load and ballast load cases including regular waves and irregular waves the overall appearance of the experiment model and wave scenario are shown in fig 10 3 4 experimental results of the resonant frequencies in the model test the time domain history of the dynamic attenuation vibrations of the vertical bending moments on the backbone are obtained via a hammering test in still water as shown in fig 11 a and fig 12 a the amplitude frequency diagrams are obtained via fourier transform as shown in figs 11 b and fig 12 b in fig 11 there are three peaks of the vertical bending moment under full load conditions two node vertical bending vibration 3 69 hz three node vertical bending vibration 8 31 hz and four node vertical bending vibration 14 19 hz for full scale the three frequencies are 2 64 rad s 5 91 rad s and 10 16 rad s respectively in fig 12 there are three peaks of the vertical bending moment under ballast conditions two node vertical bending vibration 5 08 hz three node vertical bending vibration 10 40 hz and four node vertical bending vibration 16 67 hz for full scale the frequencies are 3 64 rad s 7 45 rad s and 12 00 rad s respectively 4 numerical and experimental result analysis 4 1 hydrodynamic model because the ship hull is symmetrical about the x z plane the half model can be used in the hydrodynamic calculation and the number of elements is 2045 including the element above the still water plane as shown in fig 13 a in the iorm method based on the internal and outer region matching the hull surface free surface and virtual control surface need to be meshed as shown in fig 13 b the number of elements on the control surface and free surface are 171 and 931 respectively the radius of the free surface is 2 times that of the ship length 4 2 dry structure modelling and modal analysis 4 2 1 structure modelling in the finite element method in the model test the fluid pressure acting on the ship hull needs to be transferred to the backbone through the transverse bulkhead performing the fluid structural interaction analysis requires obtaining the modal displacement information of the ship hull in the numerical calculation in addition the global vibration shapes are determined by the stiffness of each section of the backbone and the mass distribution and the ship hull does not need to play the role of mass and stiffness effects the backbone plays the role of transferring the mode shape from the backbone to ship hull the three dimensional model consists of four parts the combined backbone ship hull bulkhead and mass points the details of the modelling are as follows i the complex combined backbone model which plays the role of structural strength support consists of many plates such as 16 plates for the containership in this paper the properties of the finite element model are e 186 gpa poisson ratio μ 0 398 and density is zero the 3d fem model of the combined backbone model is composed of 15188 shell elements as shown in fig 14 a and the plate thickness and size are set according to tables 4 and 5 ii the ship hull plays the role of no structural support and no mass effects so the density of the ship hull in the numerical prediction is zero meanwhile the young s modulus of the ship hull is also not zero but is very small to avoid local pseudo vibration mode the properties of the finite element model are e 0 01 gpa poisson ratio μ 0 398 and the density is zero the 3d fem model of ship hull is composed of 20549 shell elements as shown in fig 14 b the thickness of the plates 1 m is an empirical value combined with e 0 01 gpa to avoid a local pseudo vibration mode iii the bulkheads play the role of structural support connect the ship hull and backbone and transfer modal shapes from the backbone to the ship hull the thickness and stiffness of the bulkheads have effects on the natural frequencies of torsional bending modes and the thickness of the plate with a 0 7 m bulkhead is an empirical value after various numerical calculations by controlling the natural frequency of one node torsional bending of the combined backbone model to the same as that of the object ship the stiffness of the bulkhead directly affects the overall modal shapes and natural frequencies the properties of the finite element model are e 206 gpa poisson ratio μ 0 3 and density is zero the 3d fem model of the bulkhead is composed of 15658 shell elements as shown in fig 14 c iv the ship weight is simulated by 42 mass points and the weight distribution is symmetrical about the x z plane the element size of the entire model is approximately 1 5 m and the total number of shell elements is 51446 the combined 3d fem model is shown in fig 14 d 4 2 2 modal shapes and frequencies of the 3d fem model figs 15 20 show the dry natural vibration modes of the first six orders by the combined 3d fem model and the corresponding natural frequencies are listed in table 8 the results in the figures indicate that i the shear centre of the torsional modes in the figures is at approximately 16 m which is above the baseline but the shear centre of the midship section is 19 4 m which is shown in tables 3 and 6 ii the horizontal modes are all coupled with torsional modes and some studies shin et al 2015 peng et al 2019 have found the same phenomenon meanwhile the natural frequencies of the coupled modes are smaller than that of the single horizontal modes listed in fig 22 b d and f in contrast the modal shapes are very different to the other floating structures without large openings on the main decks such as the bulk carrier yang et al 2019 and barge yang et al 2020 in which the horizontal bending modes are not coupled with the torsional modes see fig 23 the 3d fem model actual peng et al 2019 in table 8 denotes the actual full 3d finite element model which is built by a detailed design drawing and is time consuming the errors of dry natural frequencies between the combined 3d fem model in this paper and the actual 3d fem model are less than 7 1 except for the one node torsional bending mode which is 12 6 and for the four node coupled mode which is 11 3 the error levels are acceptable for the concurrent simulation of the vertical bending vibration horizontal bending vibration and torsional vibration on the other side the ship hull and combined backbone are connected by rigid transversal frames in the model test in a seakeeping basin to simulate a real case in the experiments when the bulkhead is close to rigid the thickness of the bulkhead is recognised as 1 m in the combined 3d fem model the results of the dry natural frequencies of the finite element model become larger as shown in table 9 which indicates that the natural frequencies of the torsional modes and coupled modes of the torsional vibration and horizontal bending vibration are obviously increased for vertical bending modes the increase is 1 4 for torsional modes and coupled modes the increase is 14 39 and the frequencies of the modes are lower so the increase is even larger in the model test like that shown in fig 1 a the ship model is suspended by a number of low stiffness springs on the both sides of the deck and then the dry natural frequency of the hull structure can be obtained through the hammering test in which the dry natural frequency of the one node torsion mode is 2 76 rad s which is very consistent with the numerical calculation result 2 73 rad s in table 9 in the 3d fem model therefore the transverse frame is too rigid in the model test which makes the torsional mode deviate from the true 3d fem model however in the model test the accurate simulation of the stiffness of the transversal frame is too difficult and heavy work which will be taken into account in future research 4 2 3 modal shapes and frequencies of the 1d beam to investigate the principle and feasibility of a 1d beam a 1d straight euler bernoulli beam bauchau and craig 2009 which ignores the shear effect is composed with seven segments with parameters based on table 3 in order to simultaneously simulate vertical bending and horizontal bending vibration with the dimensions of each segment listed in table 10 each section of every segment is a rectangle as shown in fig 21 the material is steel and the young s modulus e 2 06 gpa and the poisson ratio μ 0 3 the fem model of the 1d beam consists of 100 beam elements in patran nastran the elastic vibration modes of the first six orders are shown in fig 22 and the corresponding natural frequencies are listed in table 11 it can be seen that the natural frequencies of the three node vertical bending mode are different from the actual 3d mode with a 20 error and cannot be accurately simulated even if the variable cross section steel beam of seven segments is adopted the reason for this is that the slender beam theory or euler bernoulli beam theory is no longer suitable for 3d hull vibration simulation in these cases thus the timoshenko beam theory elishakoff 2020 should be used to simulate the short and thick beam to consider the shear deformation of the section the theoretical study shows that the additional deformation mechanism of the timoshenko beam theory can effectively reduce the stiffness of beam that is to say the general euler bernoulli beam theory overestimates the natural frequencies this is confirmed by the numerical calculation results in this paper the results predicted by the general euler bernoulli beam theory are larger than those by the 3d fem model in table 11 4 2 4 modal shapes of the 3d fem model and the beam model under ballast conditions the mass distribution under a ballast load is smaller than that under a full load but the structural characteristics are the same in light of the similarities between the structural vibration modes of the container ship under a ballast and full load the horizontal bending mode is coupled with the torsional mode and the difference is that the resonance frequency of the four nodes is less than the vertical vibration of three node bending due to the similarities with the full load and limited space this paper only lists the dry modes see figs 23 24 25 26 27 28 and 29 natural frequencies and wet resonance frequencies see table 12 of the ballast condition under which the specific results will not be discussed further the sequence of the modal shapes is the same as the results of a 19 000 teu container ship im h et al 2017 however for a 13 000 teu container ship the full three dimensional finite element method was used to calculate the modal vibration mode and dry frequency under ballast conditions and the numerical results show that there are no coupled vibrations chen et al 2019 the reason may be that the structural characteristics of the 13 000 teu container ship are different from the 20 000 teu container ship in this paper 4 3 modal response analysis the viscous coefficients of the elastic modes are 1 in the calculation of the structural modal responses and wave loads the results of the modal response transfer function obtained by the fscm and iorm methods are shown in fig 30 and fig 33 where the abscissa denotes the encountering frequency in waves figs 30 and 31 a fig 32 a and fig 33 a show the transfer functions of the vertical bending vibration modal responses the results indicate that in addition to the peak value of the principal component of the wave force there are significant two node resonant points and three node resonant points in the high frequency band figs 31 b fig 32 b and fig 33 b show the response transfer functions of torsional vibration and its coupled vibration modes with horizontal bending the results indicate that there are four resonant points in the high frequency band which are one node torsion the two node coupled mode the three node coupled mode and the four node coupled mode the numerical results in tables 13 16 show that compared with the dry mode vibration in a vacuum the added mass effect of the fluid makes the resonant frequency of the vertical bending vibration decrease obviously and the influence on torsional vibration and coupled vibration with horizontal bending is weak in addition the resonant frequencies of the two node vertical bending vibration calculated by the 1d beam model are in good agreement with the model test results but the errors of the resonant frequencies of the three node vertical bending are larger compared with the results of the 3d fem model the reason is that the slender beam theory or euler bernoulli beam theory is no longer suitable for 3d hull vibration simulation in these cases 4 4 wave loading analysis after calculating the modal responses the transfer functions of the vertical bending moment horizontal bending moment and torsional moment are obtained via fluid pressure integral method in figs 34 40 a b and l denote the wave amplitude breadth and length of the floating structures g denotes the acceleration of gravity and wm model test denotes the experimental results of wave frequency components the results indicate that the numerical results are well consistent with the experimental data except for the experimental peaks of the torsional moment in an heading oblique sea of 150 and the horizontal bending moment in an oblique sea heading of 120 because the wave maker cannot produce very short waves in the model test in a seakeeping basin there are no experimental results in the high frequency band on the other side during the nondimensional wave the frequencies ω e l g are less than 40 and there are some resonant peaks at a high frequency band for vertical bending moment and torsional moments due to elastic resonant vibration of the floating structures in the fluid except for the horizontal bending moment responses 5 conclusions to simultaneously simulate vertical bending vibration horizontal bending vibration and torsional vibration in model tests in a wave basin the vibration characteristics of a combined backbone model were analysed by the three dimensional finite element method and the finite element modelling method of the 3d combined backbone model was studied then a multi segmented model test scheme was proposed as was a new arrangement of strain gauges to be used in the model test finally the resonant frequencies modal responses and wave loads of the 20 000 teu container ship in waves were evaluated by the fluid structure interaction method of three dimensional hydroelasticity some important conclusions are as follows 1 to avoid the complexity of full three dimensional structure modelling one combined model is proposed the stiffness of the transverse bulkhead has a great influence on the torsional vibration mode when the coupled vibration characteristics of bending and torsion are evaluated by the combined model this should be given more attention in numerical simulations and model tests 2 the natural frequencies of the three node vertical bending mode are different from the actual 3d mode with a 20 error and would overestimate the frequencies even if the variable cross section steel beam of seven segments is adopted the reason is that the slender beam theory or euler bernoulli beam theory is no longer suitable for 3d hull vibration simulations in these cases moreover the combined backbone model can not only accurately simulate the vibration modes and natural frequencies of the vertical bending vibration horizontal bending vibration and torsional vibration but also simplify and reduce the workload in numerical modelling compared with full 3d fem modelling the equivalence principles to simultaneously simulate vertical vibration horizontal vibration and torsional vibration in the model test and numerical assessment of hydroelasticity are proposed 3 for a container ship with a large opening the torsional vibration mode is often coupled with horizontal bending vibration where the first vibration is torsional vibration rather than the conventional vertical bending vibration of two nodes additionally an added mass effect of fluid makes the resonant frequency of the vertical bending vibration decrease obviously and the influence on the torsional vibration and vibration coupled with horizontal bending is weak 4 the numerical simulation method of hydroelasticity and the combined model proposed in this paper can accurately predict the vibration characteristics and wave loads of container ships in the fluid which are in good agreement with the experimental data during the nondimensional wave the frequencies ω e l g are smaller than 40 except for the horizontal bending moment responses and there are some resonant peaks at the high frequency band for the vertical bending moment and torsional moments due to the elastic resonant vibration of the floating structures in the fluid 5 real experiences have demonstrated that an engineer spends one to two months on modelling a detailed full 3d fem model of one ship but no more than a week on a 3d fem model of a combined backbone thus the 3d fem model of a combined backbone can save costs credit authorship contribution statement peng yang conceptualization methodology

21018,the flood caused by a dam break event generally contains a large amount of energy and it can be destructive to the downstream buildings and structures in the present study the evolution of a dam break flood and its impact pressure on a structure are considered by performing a numerical simulation a laboratory experiment is first performed to validate the numerical model subsequently simulations are performed to investigate the impact pressure of the dam break flood on a solitary structure in the downstream region the flow regime near the structure temporal variations and distributions of the impact pressure on the structure and effects of the initial reservoir water depth on the peak pressures are discussed it is observed that the profiles of the water surface at the cross section upstream and downstream of the structure are completely different in addition the surface velocity distributions are significantly different the structure suffers a large instantaneous impact pressure when the flood water first contacts the structure and the value of this pressure can reach 1 5 3 0 times that of the maximum pressure after the first impact the instantaneous impact pressure is proportional to the initial reservoir water depth the distribution of the peak pressure acting on the wall on the upstream side of the structure is nonlinear in both the horizontal and vertical directions graphical abstract an experiment validated three dimensional numerical model was used to investigate the impact of dam break flood on a solitary structure it was found that water surface profiles at cross section in the upstream and downstream of the structure are totally different the structure suffers large instantaneous impact pressure when it is bumped by the first flood wave which can reach 1 5 3 0 times as the maximum pressure at the following stage the instantaneous impact pressure is proportional to the initial reservoir water depth image 1 keywords three dimensional numerical simulation dam break flood structure impact pressure 1 introduction the impact of a flood induced by a dam break event can cause considerable damage to structures and threaten the safety of human life and property therefore understanding the mechanics of the flood damage to structures is important to improve the ability of the buildings to resist the impact of floods thieken et al 2005 mazzorana et al 2014 numerous studies have been performed on the dam break flow most of which focused on the basic hydraulic features including the depth discharge and velocity and did not consider the dynamics of the interaction between the water flow and structure the large number of geometric and hydraulic parameters peregrine 2003 kelman and spence 2004 involved in the interaction of the dam break flow and structures make it challenging to accurately describe this interaction furthermore owing to the short duration of the impact pulsation pressure acting on the structure the pressure may be underestimated or even ignored bullock et al 2001 2007 studies pertaining to dam break flow can be categorized into two types 1 studies focused on an obstruction free dam break flow over a bed and 2 those focused on the dam break flow over a bed with the structure in the downstream fraccarollo and toro 1995 conducted an experiment on the dam break flow to understand the basic flow characteristics such as the maximum water level and maximum discharge and proposed a numerical model based on the shallow water equations to reproduce the experiment lauber and hager 1998 experimentally and analytically investigated the characteristics of the dam break wave motion other similar studies pertaining to the dam break flow over a bed without structures can be found in the experimental e g eaket et al 2005 aureli et al 2008 aleixo et al 2011 elkholy et al 2016 or numerical literature e g zhou et al 2004 aliparast 2009 das and bagheri 2015 biscarini et al 2010 marsooli and wu 2014 zhang et al 2017 hu et al 2018 soares frazão and zech 2007 2008 performed several experiments corresponding to the dam break flow passing through structures to investigate the influence of the structures on the local velocity and water surface height the existing research related to the impact of water on a structure often corresponds to the coastal or offshore engineering domain focusing on the impact of breaking waves on coastal or offshore structures and the impact of overtopping green water on the decks of a ship or ship shaped floating production storage and offloading systems fpsos laboratory experiments to investigate the impact pressure of the breaking waves against a wall are generally conducted in a tank with a wave generator e g hattori et al 1994 kirkgöz et al 1995 thusyanthan et al 2007 2008 cuomo et al 2010 chinnarasri et al 2013 hu et al 2017 moreover numerical models can be applied to simulate the impact process e g wu et al 1995 xiao and huang 2008 xu 2013 bredmose et al 2015 loh et al 2018 song et al 2015 measured the impact pressure of green water on a fixed structure and found that the front shape of the breaking wave considerably influences the impact pressure chen et al 2019 assessed the impact loads of green water on both the deck and vertical wall of fixed ship shaped fpsos by using a 3d numerical model and obtained a similar conclusion that the force on the deck depends on the 3d bow shape another recent research regarding green water overtopping was conducted using modified 2d dam break models which improved the predictions compared to utilizing the classical dam break model zhang et al 2019 although only a few studies have focused on the impact of the dam break flow on structures some basic work in the related aspects can still be found a classic experiment to investigate the impact pressure of the dam break flow on a structure was conducted at the maritime research institute netherlands marin kleefsman et al 2005 and was cited for the validation of numerical models by several other researchers asai et al 2012 marsooli and wu 2014 lobovský et al 2014 and chen et al 2013 experimentally investigated the dam break flow induced impact pressure on a downstream wall in flat and sloping tanks respectively and provided detailed experimental procedures and more measurement data hu et al 2012 applied a three dimensional numerical model on the interaction of the dam break waves and structure and found that the peak load was strongly affected by the porosity of the structure aureli et al 2015 estimated the impact pressure exerted by the dam break flow on a structure by using a 2d depth averaged model a 3d eulerian two phase model and a 3d smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph model a comparison of the results of the three models with the test data indicated that the use of the 3d model could better reproduce the key features of the flip through impact while the 2d model could not accurately reproduce the load hydrograph and predict the load peak value more recently stamataki et al 2018 investigated the dam break flow interaction with a building model by performing a laboratory experiment and using a 2d numerical model and concluded that the flows around the building were three dimensional and thus they could not be accurately reproduced using the 2d numerical model furthermore a series of assumptions are adopted in the derivation of the governing equation of the 2d swe models for instance in terms of the hydrostatic pressure distribution along the direction of the water depth in addition the vertical acceleration is ignored and no drastic changes are considered in the free surface which results in the limitations of these models in cases in which the water depth in the vertical direction varies considerably including the initial stage of the dam break flow and the dam break flow near the structure these assumptions are not appropriate due to the rapid motion of the dam break flow the free surface of the water near the structure changes dramatically and the vertical pressure is not hydrostatic during its impact on the downstream structure therefore in the studies on the impact of the dam break flow the three dimensional numerical model based on the rans equations was adopted to analyze the impact process e g kleefsman et al 2005 yang et al 2011 cummins et al 2012 because detailed studies regarding the dam break interaction with structures are relatively few and the 3d numerical model can be used to numerically investigate the dam break impact problem in this paper a three dimensional numerical model based on the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations is adopted to study the interaction of the dam break flood with an isolated structure the present study is aimed at clarifying the effects of the structure on the evolution of the dam break flood and the pressure induced by the dam break on the structure moreover several initial water levels in the reservoir were considered in the simulations to explore the influence of the water level on the impact pressure peak the methodology including the governing equations and the numerical solution is described in section 2 the validation of the three dimensional numerical model is described in section 3 the application of the numerical model to investigate the interaction between the dam break flood and structure is described in section 4 section 5 presents the detailed results and corresponding discussion section 6 presents the conclusions 2 methodology 2 1 mathematical model 2 1 1 governing equations the basic equations to describe the flow of an incompressible homogeneous and viscous fluid are the continuity equation and navier stokes equations which represent the conservation of mass and momentum respectively as a dam break flow usually has a high reynolds number it varies rapidly and the flow regime is turbulent in a near field situation especially when the flow interacts with obstacles or structures yang et al 2011 in this work the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations which are derived from the basic governing equations according to the reynolds decomposition and the boussinesq assumptions are adopted to represent the turbulent flow in the cartesian coordinates the continuity and rans equations can be expressed in the tensor form as 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t u j u i x j 1 ρ p x i x j ν ν t u i x j u j x i g i where x i is the coordinate u i represents the mean velocity t represents the time p is the pressure ρ is the fluid density g i represents the gravitational acceleration ν is the molecular kinematic viscosity and ν t represents the eddy kinematic viscosity 2 1 2 turbulence model the turbulence viscosity ν t is an unknown quantity induced by the boussinesq eddy viscosity assumption and it needs to be determined to ensure that the governing equations are closed according to wilcox 1998 various turbulence models including the k ε and rng models can be used to realize the turbulence closure in the standard k ε launder and spalding 1983 and rng k ε yakhot et al 1992 models the turbulence eddy viscosity is computed using the turbulent kinetic energy k and turbulence dissipation rate ε as follows 3 ν t c μ k 2 ε where c μ is a constant which has different values in the two models the rather crude parameterization of the ε equation limits the standard k ε model bradshaw et al 1996 and the model cannot accurately predict the kinetic energy in the impingement or recirculation regions nevertheless this model is widely used and demonstrates a satisfactory accuracy in most cases koutsourakis et al 2012 therefore a modified ε equation with an extra source term is used in the rng k ε model which is derived from the instantaneous navier stokes equations by using the renormalization group rng mathematical theory in the rng k ε model the transportation equations for k and ε are as follows 4 k t u i k x i x i ν ν t σ k k x i g ε 5 ε t u i ε x i x i ν ν t σ ε ε x i c 1 ε ε k g c 2 ε ε 2 k r ε 6 r ε c μ η 3 1 η η 0 1 β η 3 ε 2 k η k ε g ν t g ν t u i x j u j x i u i x j where r ε is an additional term that is important to represent the sheared turbulence but is usually neglected in the standard k ε model and g represents the generation rate of the turbulent kinetic energy due to the mean velocity gradients the coefficients in this model are as follows c μ 0 085 c ε1 1 42 c ε2 1 68 σ k σ ε 0 7194 β 0 012 and η 0 4 38 compared to the standard k ε model the rng k ε model includes the following refinements the use of the additional term in the ε equation significantly improves the accuracy for complex flows in addition the effective viscosity and turbulent prandtl number both have an analytical formula which is equally valid for both low and high reynolds number flows consequently the rng k ε model is more accurate and reliable for a wider class of flows than the standard model papageorgakis and assanis 1999 therefore in this study the rng k ε turbulence model is applied to simulate the dam break flow around a structure 2 1 3 method to capture the free surface the free surface is captured using the volume of fluid vof method within the computational domain consisting of two fluids of different properties a function α x 1 x 2 x 3 t is defined at each point in the present study water and air are considered when the point is occupied by water α is 1 otherwise it is defined as 0 for each cell a step function f is defined as the ratio of the volume occupied by the fluid to that of the entire cell and it can be expressed in terms of the function α as 7 f x 1 x 2 x 3 t 1 δ v δ v α χ γ ζ d χ d γ d ζ where δv represents the cell volume the value of f is 1 for cells full of water and 0 for cells occupied by air the cells with f lying between 0 and 1 correspond to the free surface for incompressible flows f is determined by using the following transport equation 8 f t u i f x i 0 2 2 numerical solution method the finite volume method and forward euler method kleefsman et al 2005 are respectively employed for the spatial and temporal discretization of the governing equations to perform the discrete numerical approximations of the governing equations the computational region is subdivided into a mesh composed of rectangular cells with each cell relevant to the local mean values of all the dependent variables the scalars including the pressure p fluid fraction f density ρ viscosity ν ν t turbulent kinetic energy k and dissipation rate ε are located in the center of the cell while vectors such as the velocities are located at the side faces of the cell the control volumes are defined as surrounding the dependent variables the surface fluxes surface stresses and body forces of each control volume are computed in terms of the surrounding variable values to be combined to form the approximations of the conversation equations the resulting finite difference equations are then solved using the generalized minimum residual gmres iterative method owing to the high accuracy rapid convergence and parallel efficiency of this method an initial value needs to be specified for the time step size to initiate the calculation and this value is automatically adjusted according to the courant friedrichs lewy cfl criterion in the following calculation 3 validation of the numerical model 3 1 existing experiment for the validation at the technical university of madrid to investigate the pressure loads on a vertical downstream wall induced by a dam break wave front lobovský et al 2014 performed an experiment similar to that of lee et al 2002 regarding the dam break flow with a scale of 1 2 compared to that employed in lee s work a prismatic tank with inner dimensions of 1610 600 150 mm and an open roof was used in the experiment the tank was divided into two parts by a removable gate one part was 600 mm long forming a reservoir with an initial water depth and the other part was the downstream region with a 1010 mm long dry bed five pressure transducers were inset into the downstream wall of the tank to measure the impact pressure loads digital cameras were used to capture the evolution of the free surface profile from lateral frontal and top views the time history of the water surface level was analyzed by considering the video images in several locations the size of the tank locations of the pressure sensors and water level measurement positions are shown in fig 1 for the numerical modeling the computational domain was configured to have the same size as that of the experimental setup except for the height since the maximal vertical jets caused by the impingement were observed to be higher than the tank during the experiment preliminary testing was performed considering different domain heights in particular 0 65 m 0 8 m 1 0 m to detect the maximum jets height which was finally determined to be approximately 0 9 m therefore the computational domain was set at a height of 1 0 m three different meshes with sizes of 3 mm 5 mm and 8 mm in all the directions for each cell were used for the computations since all the surfaces of the tank bottom and sidewalls were assumed to be smooth all the boundaries were set as rigid walls except for the top boundary in which constant atmospheric pressure was applied as the boundary condition in addition the tangential and normal velocities at the solid boundary were zero no slip condition a fluid volume with a height dimension of 300 mm corresponding to the initial height h 300 mm in the experiment in the reservoir was defined as an initial condition for the computation the initial time step was chosen as 0 001 s to start the simulation 3 2 comparison between numerical results and experimental data the simulated water level and pressure of the three different meshes and the evolution time were normalized by using h ρgh and h g 1 2 respectively to enable a comparison with the experimental data the root mean square deviation rmsd was adopted to quantitatively evaluate the differences between the numerical simulations and experimental measurements in addition the convergence of the simulation with different grid sizes was verified the comparison between the numerical results of different meshes and experimental data corresponding to the water level at the given locations h1 h2 h3 and h4 see fig 1 is shown in fig 2 it can be noted that the numerical model provides a reasonable prediction for the characteristics of the wave evolution including the presence of a secondary wave at the upstream location h1 and both the primary and secondary waves at the downstream locations h2 h3 and h4 the numerical results for the water level agree with the experimental data at all the locations before the arrival of the secondary wave the arrival time of the secondary wave and its elevation at locations h1 h2 and h3 are well predicted however at location h4 a small splash before the secondary wave which was observed in the experiment is not captured by the numerical model resulting in the simulation exhibiting a slight lag in the water level change this phenomenon may occur due to the characteristics of the numerical surface tracking algorithms as well as the randomness of the water flow in the experiment the intense flow caused by the impinging jets considerably influences the nearest point h4 making it more difficult to predict as shown in table 1 the rmsd values at all the locations are extremely small and even the largest value which occurs at location h4 is less than 5 a total of 100 tests under the same conditions were conducted in the experiment to take into account the randomness and uncertainties fig 3 shows the numerical pressure predictions and the confidence intervals of the pressure time histories based on the 100 experimental tests as seen the tendencies of the pressure changes over time obtained using the simulation are consistent with those noted in the experiment the significant pressure peaks induced by the impact events at gauges 1 2 and 3 are well reproduced using the numerical model moreover the simulated pressure hydrographs of gauges 1 2 and 3 are in agreement with the experimental data although the time history of the pressure at gauge 4 is underestimated by the simulation the rmsd values pertaining to the median percentile level are smaller than 21 as shown in table 1 to summarize the comparisons between the numerical results and experimental data for both the water level and pressure indicate that the present numerical model can solve the dam break wave impact problem in addition the numerical results with different mesh sizes are remarkably similar indicating that the convergent solution is approximately achieved it should also be noted that the computational costs increase as the mesh becomes finer the time taken for a mesh with a grid spacing of 3 mm 5 mm and 8 mm to calculate a 2 s flow is 32 01 h 3 39 h and 0 95 h respectively therefore the grid convergence test is an effective method to ensure the accuracy of the results and save computing resources 4 application of numerical model the geometry used in this study to investigate the dam break flood problem is illustrated in fig 4 the whole computational region is 14 m long 1 5 m wide and 1 8 m high and it is divided into two parts including a 5 m long reservoir in the upstream and a 9 m long dry bed in the downstream regions a rectangular structure with a size of 0 74 m 0 69 m 0 52 m is located at the center of the bed in the cross direction 3 m away from the reservoir the proposed simulation configuration is a laboratory scale which serves as a simplified experimental analog of dam break flows a dam break can occur for a variety of reasons such as piping seepage foundation settlement and overtopping if a large amount of impoundment is present in the reservoir a dam break incident can induce disastrous consequences to the downstream buildings on the downstream floodplain particularly those near the dam breach can be easily destroyed by the dam break floodwater the rectangular structure used in this work represents a typical solitary one room residential building on the flood plain and its size is reduced in a ratio of 1 6 to that of a real building since the purpose of this paper is to explore the pressure distribution on the wall surface of the structure the openings of a house such as windows and doors were not considered in the simulation in other words the structure was treated as impermeable the boundaries of the computational domain including the upstream end two lateral sides and the bottom were set as a rigid wall as no water flows into out of the computational domain across these boundaries the rectangular structure was also regarded as a solid wall the roughness height of all the wall boundaries was set as 0 005 mm and the roughness constant as 0 5 the no slip condition was defined at the solid boundary and logarithmic velocity distributions were used in the boundary layer the pressure boundary was applied on the upside of the domain since the flow was fully developed and the reflux was not considered in this paper the downstream end was labeled as a free outflow boundary the reservoir contained a water body with a height of h 0 which was designated as the initial condition table 2 lists the five different initial water heights h 0 used in the numerical experiments in the present investigation 0 5 m 0 6 m 0 7 m 0 8 m and 0 9 m the mesh used for the numerical calculation was composed of quadrangular cells a smaller grid cell means that the shape of the structure is closer to the original geometry however an extremely small grid size results in a large number of cells thereby increasing the computational cost in terms of time and storage therefore an appropriate grid size needs to be determined to maintain a balance between the cost and accuracy to this end a smaller grid block surrounding the structure was nested into that of the whole computational domain in general different grid cell sizes can be applied in two grid blocks to satisfy the quantitative limitation of the grid cells and ensure the accurate resolution of the structure shape simultaneously ultimately the small grid block consisted of 385 280 cells with a size of 0 01 m each for the larger grid block the cell size in the x direction was 0 02 m gradually varying cell sizes with a minimum value of 0 02 m and maximum value of 0 1 m were used in both the y and z directions and a total of 2 433 159 cells were obtained more details regarding the mesh are presented in fig 5 as mentioned in section 2 2 the initial time step size was 0 001 s while the time step in the following computation was determined using the courant friedrichs lewy criterion to maintain stability 5 results and discussion 5 1 kinematic analysis the downstream flow in the case involving a structure is more complex than that without a structure to investigate the flow near the structure the typical simulation results of case 1 with an initial water depth h 0 0 5 m in the reservoir are presented three cross sections a a y 1 0 m b b y 0 05 m c c y 1 0 m were considered to measure the water depth as shown in fig 6 5 1 1 water surface evolution the evolution of the water surface near the structure is shown in fig 7 it must be noted that the downstream direction is from right to left as shown in fig 7 a the dam break flood wave reaches the structure at t 0 92 s and the flow remains mostly laminar at t 1 15 s the flood wave bumps against the structure and the main flow is separated into two parts a vertical runup jet along the upstream wall of the structure and a pair of approximately symmetric flows around the structure after some time the jet like flow falls under gravity onto the underlying fluid and the symmetric flows continues moving downstream without converging behind the structure fig 7 c at t 2 30 s the water surface near the upstream wall of the structure fluctuates severely due to the mixing of the reflected flow and the fluid moving downstream at the same time the flows passing around the structure begin to meet and amalgamate into one flow approximately 1 3 m behind the structure a waterless area always exists behind the structure later the fluctuation of the water surface in the upstream of the structure gradually decreases during the propagation of the reflected wave and the dry bed behind the structure is fully occupied by the fluid it can also be observed that the area behind the structure is clearly partitioned into three parts with a triangular part at the center according to the free surface height fig 7 e and f to understand the effects of a structure on the water surface elevation the results of the water depths at three cross sections were considered for the comparison as shown in fig 6 b the three cross sections are close to the structure but are located at different distances as shown in fig 8 a on cross section b b the impact jet generates considerably higher depths in front of the structure than those on both sides without the obstruction reaching a maximum depth of approximately 0 53 m the depths pertaining to section a a are nearly equivalent due to the mostly laminar flow for the c c section the depths at the same distance from x 0 are similar demonstrating that the flows passing around the structure are symmetric subsequently affected by the reflected flow the hydrograph of section a a is no longer a straight line and the depths pertaining to section b b are larger than those for both sections a a and c c see fig 8 b and c because of the decrease in the kinetic energy the hydrograph of section a a resembles a straight line again and its depths begin to get close to those of section b b fig 8 d after the two separated flows join to become one flow the water surface profile on section c c is shaped like a w with a hump in the middle x 0 m fig 8 c and d as described above the structure considerably influences the water surface evolution 1 the shapes of the water surface profile on each section are completely different at the same time 2 the impinging jet and water wave reflected by the structure cause severe turbulence leading to the occurrence of intense fluctuations on the water surface on the same section near the structure 5 1 2 velocity field of the flow near the structure fig 9 shows the velocity components in the streamwise y direction and lateral x direction directions on the water surface near the structure denoted as v y and v x respectively for the simplicity of description before impinging fig 9 a the flow is dominated by the velocity in the y direction and only an extremely small velocity in the x direction appears near the flume wall at t 1 4 s v y in front of the structure decreases rapidly to an extremely small value in addition v x of the symmetric flows mentioned previously can be clearly observed fig 9 b after the falling of the impact jet the superficial fluid in front of the structure begins to advance toward the upstream region with a negative v y fig 9 c and d in addition fig 9 c and d indicate that the distributions of both the flow velocities v y and v x are symmetric behind the structure however in the same zone of the flow field v y and v x increase or decrease along the x axis in exactly the opposite direction before the dry area behind the structure is filled with water the maximum value of v x in the downstream increases from 0 3 m s fig 9 b t 1 4 s to 2 0 m s fig 9 d t 4 s which is approximately 2 3rd the maximum value of v x a slice of the v y contour is shown in fig 10 to provide insight into the motion of the reflected water wave a water curtain with a large negative v y appears when the vertical jet falls after the complete collapse of the water curtain the upper fluid before the structure mainly maintains a negative v y despite this phenomenon the upper fluid is driven back by the main flow from the upstream region fig 10 t 2 50 s and the absolute value of the corresponding v y is reduced at t 3 00 s the absolute v y decreases to 0 and the water surface in front of the structure becomes higher than that of the upstream shortly afterwards another new superficial water wave is generated under gravity and it propagates to the upstream region the longitudinal water profile gradually flattens during the propagation of the wave as shown in fig 7 the distributions of the vertical velocity component during the impact period are presented in fig 11 it can be observed that the vertical movement of the water near the structure is considerably more intense than that in any region far from the structure the maximum vertical upward velocity among that at different instants occurs at the corner in which the main flow changes its direction of movement thereby generating vertical jets in front of the structure the value of the maximum vertical upward velocity can reach approximately 3 0 m s fig 11 a and its order of magnitude is equivalent to that of the horizontal velocity component the falling jet has a negative vertical velocity component and its largest absolute value up to approximately 2 5 m s appears at the position in which the falling jet comes into contact with the surface layer of the incoming flow fig 11 d the fact that the velocity component in the vertical direction can reach such a high value indicates that the water flow motion should be considered as completely three dimensional when investigating the impact problems by numerical means 5 2 impact dynamics analysis in the process of the dam break flood spreading to the downstream region the water first comes into contact with the upstream side surface of the structure as a result the impact pressure acts mainly on this surface several probes were used to explore the impact pressure and the probe locations are presented in fig 12 in the local coordinates 5 2 1 pressure time history fig 13 shows the time series of the pressure at the specified probes under different initial water depths in the reservoir grouped by three vertical directions x 0 03 m x 0 37 m and x 0 71 m for each initial depth it can be noted that the temporal variations of the pressure at the lower and upper positions are considerably different the pressure of the probes at lower positions can be divided into two parts according to the main causes of the pressure 1 the large instantaneous impact pressure generated due to the loss of the kinetic energy of the primary flood water wave as it first impacts the upstream sidewall of the structure and 2 the variation in the hydrostatic pressure with the water depth in front of the structure after the impingement the instantaneous impact pressure is considerably greater than that at any other time stage and it can reach values 1 5 3 0 times that of the maximum pressure after the first impact the pressure of the probes at the upper locations which is mainly hydrostatic is similar to the second type of the pressure at the lower probes a comparison of the pressure changes under five different initial depths h 0 indicates that the height ranges of the probes with a large instantaneous impact pressure on the upstream side surface of the structure are different as shown in fig 13 a and b for both h 0 0 8 m and 0 9 m probes p7 p8 and p9 z 0 09 m correspond to the highest points at which a large instantaneous impact pressure can be detected at the moment that the flow impacts the structure however for h 0 0 7 m a large instantaneous impact pressure can be observed only at probes p4 p5 and p6 z 0 06 m fig 13 c and for h 0 0 6 m and h 0 0 5 m only the lowest probes p1 p2 and p3 z 0 03 m exhibit this phenomenon fig 13 d and e as shown in fig 14 and fig 15 a larger h 0 results in higher water surface and faster flood wave for every 0 1 m increase in h 0 the water surface height increases by 0 06 m on average and the flood wave velocity increases by approximately 0 3 m s therefore the maximum height at which the large instantaneous impact pressure can be measured varies with h 0 5 2 2 peak pressure this section discusses the distribution of the peak pressure on the upstream side surface of the structure by considering the results of the specified probes the changes in the peak pressure along the z axis vertical direction and x axis horizontal direction for h 0 0 7 m are presented in fig 16 a and b respectively as seen from fig 16 a the distribution of the peak pressure in the vertical direction is a curve with the slope gradually changing from steep to gentle indicating that the peak pressure gradient in the vertical direction decreases with the increase in the height the difference between the peak pressure at the probes at z 0 03 m p1 p2 and p3 and z 0 06 m p4 p5 and p6 is the largest among that for all the adjacent probes in the same vertical direction with values of approximately 2 50 kpa for p1 and p4 3 65 kpa for p2 and p5 and 2 45 kpa for p3 and p6 in addition it can be observed that the peak pressures of the probes at the same height along lines x 0 03 m and x 0 71 m are nearly equivalent however the pressure values are lower than those at the same height along line x 0 37 m therefore the pressure peak shows a nearly symmetrical distribution along the x axis as shown in fig 16 b similar to the trend of the vertical distribution the difference between the peak pressures at lines x 0 37 m and x 0 03 m or line x 0 71 m at the same height decreases from the bottom to the top of the upstream side surface of the structure as well fig 16 c for the other values of h 0 0 5 m 0 6 m 0 8 m and 0 9 m the characteristics of the peak pressure distribution described above are similar and are therefore not expounded a comparison of the peak pressure distribution corresponding to different h 0 values along the vertical direction is shown in fig 17 the peak pressure corresponding to different h 0 varies considerably at a height less than 1 5th that of the upstream sidewall of the structure albeit with a smaller diversity at higher positions as h 0 increases by 0 1 m the pressure peak increases by approximately 3 kpa at a height of z 0 03 m while it increases by only 0 3 kpa at z 0 47 m fig 18 shows the comparison of the distribution of the pressure peaks corresponding to different h 0 along the horizontal direction at different heights the variation in the pressure peak caused by the change in h 0 is basically the same at the probes located symmetrically to the middle line x 0 37 m however the variation is greater for probes along the line x 0 37 m in addition the difference between the peak pressures along x 0 37 m and x 0 03 m or x 0 71 m increases with h 0 this tendency can be more clearly observed in fig 19 where the difference is denoted as δp in units of kpa 5 2 3 convergence analysis for impact pressure for the grid convergence test in addition to the gradual mesh with a nested grid block used for all the calculations three other different meshes corresponding to cell sizes of 20 30 and 50 mm are considered all the tests are conducted under the initial condition of h 0 0 7 m the variables with respect to the pressure at p1 p2 and p3 are adopted for the analysis both the pressure and pressure impulse time histories of the impact process are presented in fig 20 the pressure impulse is a meaningful representation for the pressure evolution in time which is defined as the integral of the pressure over the period from time t 0 s to the following time t peregrine 2003 and can be expressed as 9 i x t 0 t p x t d t as seen in fig 20 the overall variations of the pressure from different meshes match well except for the coarsest one moreover the results of the pressure at p1 and p2 exhibit less consistency for the coarsest mesh with respect to those for the other meshes when a coarser mesh 30 mm or 50 mm is used apparent oscillations of the pressure occur at p2 at the impact moment the results of all the meshes indicate that the impact peak pressure obtained by the finer mesh is slightly larger than that obtained using the coarser one according to peregrine 2003 the pressure impulses exhibit a high consistency across different tests however in the simulation tests for meshes involving cells of different sizes except for the agreement of the predicted pressure impulses of all the meshes at p2 significant discrepancies of the pressure impulse appear at p1 and p3 where the pressure impulse of the coarser mesh 30 mm or 50 mm is distinctly lower than that for the finer mesh in particular the pressure impulses at p1 p2 and p3 in the impact duration shorter than 1 7 s are all underestimated compared to those obtained using the coarsest mesh a further quantitative comparison of the pressures with different meshes is given in table 3 two relative deviations marked rd 1 and rd 2 are considered 1 rd 1 represents the relative deviation of the results of each coarser mesh to those of the finest mesh 2 rd 2 is the relative deviation between the solutions obtained using two mesh levels and calculated using ϕ coarser ϕ finer ϕ finer where ϕ coarser and ϕ finer denote the results pertaining to the coarser and finer levels of the two meshes respectively the values of rd 1 for the peak pressure p peak and pressure impulse i 1s increase with the increase in the mesh cell size while the same change in the rd 2 value is noted only for i 1s in terms of the previously mentioned discrepancies of the pressure impulse the values of both rd 1 and rd 2 of i 1s are larger than those of p peak when the coarsest mesh is used which means that the use of excessively large mesh cells can lead to inaccurate results by sorting the meshes of different cell sizes gradual mesh 30 mm and 50 mm according to the absolute values of rd 1 and rd 2 it can be noted that the rd 1 value of the gradual mesh is always the smallest similarly for rd 2 of i 1s the gradual mesh always corresponds to the minimum value as well for rd 2 of p peak the gradual mesh 30 mm mesh and 50 mm mesh have their minimum values at p3 p2 and p1 respectively overall in all the cases rd 1 and rd 2 of the gradual mesh have the minimum values in the maximum number of cases accounting for 86 3 of the total cases which is considerably higher than the occurrences for the other two meshes 30 mm and 50 mm in addition the meshes of different sizes incur different computation times the time required for the 20 mm mesh 30 mm mesh 50 mm mesh and gradual mesh for a 10 s flow simulation is 9 04 h 6 5 h 0 24 h and 7 37 h respectively therefore the gradual mesh was finally adopted in consideration of both the accuracy and reduction of the computational cost 6 conclusion in this paper a 3d numerical model based on the rans equations and rng k ε turbulent closure is applied to investigate the impact of a dam break induced flood on a structure the model is first used to simulate an experiment the comparison between the convergent simulation results and experimental data demonstrates that the present model can predict both the motions and dynamics of the dam break flow next the model is applied to investigate the interaction between the dam break flood water and a solitary structure the impingement makes the water flow considerably turbulent and violent especially in the vicinity of the structure the evolution of the water surface and the distribution of the velocity field indicate that the water movement is completely three dimensional the peak pressure in the initial stage of the impact is significantly high and it can reach values 1 5 3 0 times that of the maximum pressure after the first impact the distributions of the peak pressure on the upstream sidewall of the structure are nonlinear in both the vertical and horizontal directions the value of the peak pressure and nonlinearity of its distribution are proportional to the initial reservoir water depth h 0 in addition the grid convergence tests for the pressure indicate that an excessively coarse mesh may lead to inaccurate results therefore extreme care should be taken when determining a mesh for calculation from the practical engineering point of view the large impact peak pressure should be considered as a key factor of the structural damage in a flood or tsunami prone area the numerical model is promising as an efficient method to predict the water wave induced pressure on a structure and provide suggestions for the practical design and local reinforcement of

21018,the flood caused by a dam break event generally contains a large amount of energy and it can be destructive to the downstream buildings and structures in the present study the evolution of a dam break flood and its impact pressure on a structure are considered by performing a numerical simulation a laboratory experiment is first performed to validate the numerical model subsequently simulations are performed to investigate the impact pressure of the dam break flood on a solitary structure in the downstream region the flow regime near the structure temporal variations and distributions of the impact pressure on the structure and effects of the initial reservoir water depth on the peak pressures are discussed it is observed that the profiles of the water surface at the cross section upstream and downstream of the structure are completely different in addition the surface velocity distributions are significantly different the structure suffers a large instantaneous impact pressure when the flood water first contacts the structure and the value of this pressure can reach 1 5 3 0 times that of the maximum pressure after the first impact the instantaneous impact pressure is proportional to the initial reservoir water depth the distribution of the peak pressure acting on the wall on the upstream side of the structure is nonlinear in both the horizontal and vertical directions graphical abstract an experiment validated three dimensional numerical model was used to investigate the impact of dam break flood on a solitary structure it was found that water surface profiles at cross section in the upstream and downstream of the structure are totally different the structure suffers large instantaneous impact pressure when it is bumped by the first flood wave which can reach 1 5 3 0 times as the maximum pressure at the following stage the instantaneous impact pressure is proportional to the initial reservoir water depth image 1 keywords three dimensional numerical simulation dam break flood structure impact pressure 1 introduction the impact of a flood induced by a dam break event can cause considerable damage to structures and threaten the safety of human life and property therefore understanding the mechanics of the flood damage to structures is important to improve the ability of the buildings to resist the impact of floods thieken et al 2005 mazzorana et al 2014 numerous studies have been performed on the dam break flow most of which focused on the basic hydraulic features including the depth discharge and velocity and did not consider the dynamics of the interaction between the water flow and structure the large number of geometric and hydraulic parameters peregrine 2003 kelman and spence 2004 involved in the interaction of the dam break flow and structures make it challenging to accurately describe this interaction furthermore owing to the short duration of the impact pulsation pressure acting on the structure the pressure may be underestimated or even ignored bullock et al 2001 2007 studies pertaining to dam break flow can be categorized into two types 1 studies focused on an obstruction free dam break flow over a bed and 2 those focused on the dam break flow over a bed with the structure in the downstream fraccarollo and toro 1995 conducted an experiment on the dam break flow to understand the basic flow characteristics such as the maximum water level and maximum discharge and proposed a numerical model based on the shallow water equations to reproduce the experiment lauber and hager 1998 experimentally and analytically investigated the characteristics of the dam break wave motion other similar studies pertaining to the dam break flow over a bed without structures can be found in the experimental e g eaket et al 2005 aureli et al 2008 aleixo et al 2011 elkholy et al 2016 or numerical literature e g zhou et al 2004 aliparast 2009 das and bagheri 2015 biscarini et al 2010 marsooli and wu 2014 zhang et al 2017 hu et al 2018 soares frazão and zech 2007 2008 performed several experiments corresponding to the dam break flow passing through structures to investigate the influence of the structures on the local velocity and water surface height the existing research related to the impact of water on a structure often corresponds to the coastal or offshore engineering domain focusing on the impact of breaking waves on coastal or offshore structures and the impact of overtopping green water on the decks of a ship or ship shaped floating production storage and offloading systems fpsos laboratory experiments to investigate the impact pressure of the breaking waves against a wall are generally conducted in a tank with a wave generator e g hattori et al 1994 kirkgöz et al 1995 thusyanthan et al 2007 2008 cuomo et al 2010 chinnarasri et al 2013 hu et al 2017 moreover numerical models can be applied to simulate the impact process e g wu et al 1995 xiao and huang 2008 xu 2013 bredmose et al 2015 loh et al 2018 song et al 2015 measured the impact pressure of green water on a fixed structure and found that the front shape of the breaking wave considerably influences the impact pressure chen et al 2019 assessed the impact loads of green water on both the deck and vertical wall of fixed ship shaped fpsos by using a 3d numerical model and obtained a similar conclusion that the force on the deck depends on the 3d bow shape another recent research regarding green water overtopping was conducted using modified 2d dam break models which improved the predictions compared to utilizing the classical dam break model zhang et al 2019 although only a few studies have focused on the impact of the dam break flow on structures some basic work in the related aspects can still be found a classic experiment to investigate the impact pressure of the dam break flow on a structure was conducted at the maritime research institute netherlands marin kleefsman et al 2005 and was cited for the validation of numerical models by several other researchers asai et al 2012 marsooli and wu 2014 lobovský et al 2014 and chen et al 2013 experimentally investigated the dam break flow induced impact pressure on a downstream wall in flat and sloping tanks respectively and provided detailed experimental procedures and more measurement data hu et al 2012 applied a three dimensional numerical model on the interaction of the dam break waves and structure and found that the peak load was strongly affected by the porosity of the structure aureli et al 2015 estimated the impact pressure exerted by the dam break flow on a structure by using a 2d depth averaged model a 3d eulerian two phase model and a 3d smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph model a comparison of the results of the three models with the test data indicated that the use of the 3d model could better reproduce the key features of the flip through impact while the 2d model could not accurately reproduce the load hydrograph and predict the load peak value more recently stamataki et al 2018 investigated the dam break flow interaction with a building model by performing a laboratory experiment and using a 2d numerical model and concluded that the flows around the building were three dimensional and thus they could not be accurately reproduced using the 2d numerical model furthermore a series of assumptions are adopted in the derivation of the governing equation of the 2d swe models for instance in terms of the hydrostatic pressure distribution along the direction of the water depth in addition the vertical acceleration is ignored and no drastic changes are considered in the free surface which results in the limitations of these models in cases in which the water depth in the vertical direction varies considerably including the initial stage of the dam break flow and the dam break flow near the structure these assumptions are not appropriate due to the rapid motion of the dam break flow the free surface of the water near the structure changes dramatically and the vertical pressure is not hydrostatic during its impact on the downstream structure therefore in the studies on the impact of the dam break flow the three dimensional numerical model based on the rans equations was adopted to analyze the impact process e g kleefsman et al 2005 yang et al 2011 cummins et al 2012 because detailed studies regarding the dam break interaction with structures are relatively few and the 3d numerical model can be used to numerically investigate the dam break impact problem in this paper a three dimensional numerical model based on the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations is adopted to study the interaction of the dam break flood with an isolated structure the present study is aimed at clarifying the effects of the structure on the evolution of the dam break flood and the pressure induced by the dam break on the structure moreover several initial water levels in the reservoir were considered in the simulations to explore the influence of the water level on the impact pressure peak the methodology including the governing equations and the numerical solution is described in section 2 the validation of the three dimensional numerical model is described in section 3 the application of the numerical model to investigate the interaction between the dam break flood and structure is described in section 4 section 5 presents the detailed results and corresponding discussion section 6 presents the conclusions 2 methodology 2 1 mathematical model 2 1 1 governing equations the basic equations to describe the flow of an incompressible homogeneous and viscous fluid are the continuity equation and navier stokes equations which represent the conservation of mass and momentum respectively as a dam break flow usually has a high reynolds number it varies rapidly and the flow regime is turbulent in a near field situation especially when the flow interacts with obstacles or structures yang et al 2011 in this work the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations which are derived from the basic governing equations according to the reynolds decomposition and the boussinesq assumptions are adopted to represent the turbulent flow in the cartesian coordinates the continuity and rans equations can be expressed in the tensor form as 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t u j u i x j 1 ρ p x i x j ν ν t u i x j u j x i g i where x i is the coordinate u i represents the mean velocity t represents the time p is the pressure ρ is the fluid density g i represents the gravitational acceleration ν is the molecular kinematic viscosity and ν t represents the eddy kinematic viscosity 2 1 2 turbulence model the turbulence viscosity ν t is an unknown quantity induced by the boussinesq eddy viscosity assumption and it needs to be determined to ensure that the governing equations are closed according to wilcox 1998 various turbulence models including the k ε and rng models can be used to realize the turbulence closure in the standard k ε launder and spalding 1983 and rng k ε yakhot et al 1992 models the turbulence eddy viscosity is computed using the turbulent kinetic energy k and turbulence dissipation rate ε as follows 3 ν t c μ k 2 ε where c μ is a constant which has different values in the two models the rather crude parameterization of the ε equation limits the standard k ε model bradshaw et al 1996 and the model cannot accurately predict the kinetic energy in the impingement or recirculation regions nevertheless this model is widely used and demonstrates a satisfactory accuracy in most cases koutsourakis et al 2012 therefore a modified ε equation with an extra source term is used in the rng k ε model which is derived from the instantaneous navier stokes equations by using the renormalization group rng mathematical theory in the rng k ε model the transportation equations for k and ε are as follows 4 k t u i k x i x i ν ν t σ k k x i g ε 5 ε t u i ε x i x i ν ν t σ ε ε x i c 1 ε ε k g c 2 ε ε 2 k r ε 6 r ε c μ η 3 1 η η 0 1 β η 3 ε 2 k η k ε g ν t g ν t u i x j u j x i u i x j where r ε is an additional term that is important to represent the sheared turbulence but is usually neglected in the standard k ε model and g represents the generation rate of the turbulent kinetic energy due to the mean velocity gradients the coefficients in this model are as follows c μ 0 085 c ε1 1 42 c ε2 1 68 σ k σ ε 0 7194 β 0 012 and η 0 4 38 compared to the standard k ε model the rng k ε model includes the following refinements the use of the additional term in the ε equation significantly improves the accuracy for complex flows in addition the effective viscosity and turbulent prandtl number both have an analytical formula which is equally valid for both low and high reynolds number flows consequently the rng k ε model is more accurate and reliable for a wider class of flows than the standard model papageorgakis and assanis 1999 therefore in this study the rng k ε turbulence model is applied to simulate the dam break flow around a structure 2 1 3 method to capture the free surface the free surface is captured using the volume of fluid vof method within the computational domain consisting of two fluids of different properties a function α x 1 x 2 x 3 t is defined at each point in the present study water and air are considered when the point is occupied by water α is 1 otherwise it is defined as 0 for each cell a step function f is defined as the ratio of the volume occupied by the fluid to that of the entire cell and it can be expressed in terms of the function α as 7 f x 1 x 2 x 3 t 1 δ v δ v α χ γ ζ d χ d γ d ζ where δv represents the cell volume the value of f is 1 for cells full of water and 0 for cells occupied by air the cells with f lying between 0 and 1 correspond to the free surface for incompressible flows f is determined by using the following transport equation 8 f t u i f x i 0 2 2 numerical solution method the finite volume method and forward euler method kleefsman et al 2005 are respectively employed for the spatial and temporal discretization of the governing equations to perform the discrete numerical approximations of the governing equations the computational region is subdivided into a mesh composed of rectangular cells with each cell relevant to the local mean values of all the dependent variables the scalars including the pressure p fluid fraction f density ρ viscosity ν ν t turbulent kinetic energy k and dissipation rate ε are located in the center of the cell while vectors such as the velocities are located at the side faces of the cell the control volumes are defined as surrounding the dependent variables the surface fluxes surface stresses and body forces of each control volume are computed in terms of the surrounding variable values to be combined to form the approximations of the conversation equations the resulting finite difference equations are then solved using the generalized minimum residual gmres iterative method owing to the high accuracy rapid convergence and parallel efficiency of this method an initial value needs to be specified for the time step size to initiate the calculation and this value is automatically adjusted according to the courant friedrichs lewy cfl criterion in the following calculation 3 validation of the numerical model 3 1 existing experiment for the validation at the technical university of madrid to investigate the pressure loads on a vertical downstream wall induced by a dam break wave front lobovský et al 2014 performed an experiment similar to that of lee et al 2002 regarding the dam break flow with a scale of 1 2 compared to that employed in lee s work a prismatic tank with inner dimensions of 1610 600 150 mm and an open roof was used in the experiment the tank was divided into two parts by a removable gate one part was 600 mm long forming a reservoir with an initial water depth and the other part was the downstream region with a 1010 mm long dry bed five pressure transducers were inset into the downstream wall of the tank to measure the impact pressure loads digital cameras were used to capture the evolution of the free surface profile from lateral frontal and top views the time history of the water surface level was analyzed by considering the video images in several locations the size of the tank locations of the pressure sensors and water level measurement positions are shown in fig 1 for the numerical modeling the computational domain was configured to have the same size as that of the experimental setup except for the height since the maximal vertical jets caused by the impingement were observed to be higher than the tank during the experiment preliminary testing was performed considering different domain heights in particular 0 65 m 0 8 m 1 0 m to detect the maximum jets height which was finally determined to be approximately 0 9 m therefore the computational domain was set at a height of 1 0 m three different meshes with sizes of 3 mm 5 mm and 8 mm in all the directions for each cell were used for the computations since all the surfaces of the tank bottom and sidewalls were assumed to be smooth all the boundaries were set as rigid walls except for the top boundary in which constant atmospheric pressure was applied as the boundary condition in addition the tangential and normal velocities at the solid boundary were zero no slip condition a fluid volume with a height dimension of 300 mm corresponding to the initial height h 300 mm in the experiment in the reservoir was defined as an initial condition for the computation the initial time step was chosen as 0 001 s to start the simulation 3 2 comparison between numerical results and experimental data the simulated water level and pressure of the three different meshes and the evolution time were normalized by using h ρgh and h g 1 2 respectively to enable a comparison with the experimental data the root mean square deviation rmsd was adopted to quantitatively evaluate the differences between the numerical simulations and experimental measurements in addition the convergence of the simulation with different grid sizes was verified the comparison between the numerical results of different meshes and experimental data corresponding to the water level at the given locations h1 h2 h3 and h4 see fig 1 is shown in fig 2 it can be noted that the numerical model provides a reasonable prediction for the characteristics of the wave evolution including the presence of a secondary wave at the upstream location h1 and both the primary and secondary waves at the downstream locations h2 h3 and h4 the numerical results for the water level agree with the experimental data at all the locations before the arrival of the secondary wave the arrival time of the secondary wave and its elevation at locations h1 h2 and h3 are well predicted however at location h4 a small splash before the secondary wave which was observed in the experiment is not captured by the numerical model resulting in the simulation exhibiting a slight lag in the water level change this phenomenon may occur due to the characteristics of the numerical surface tracking algorithms as well as the randomness of the water flow in the experiment the intense flow caused by the impinging jets considerably influences the nearest point h4 making it more difficult to predict as shown in table 1 the rmsd values at all the locations are extremely small and even the largest value which occurs at location h4 is less than 5 a total of 100 tests under the same conditions were conducted in the experiment to take into account the randomness and uncertainties fig 3 shows the numerical pressure predictions and the confidence intervals of the pressure time histories based on the 100 experimental tests as seen the tendencies of the pressure changes over time obtained using the simulation are consistent with those noted in the experiment the significant pressure peaks induced by the impact events at gauges 1 2 and 3 are well reproduced using the numerical model moreover the simulated pressure hydrographs of gauges 1 2 and 3 are in agreement with the experimental data although the time history of the pressure at gauge 4 is underestimated by the simulation the rmsd values pertaining to the median percentile level are smaller than 21 as shown in table 1 to summarize the comparisons between the numerical results and experimental data for both the water level and pressure indicate that the present numerical model can solve the dam break wave impact problem in addition the numerical results with different mesh sizes are remarkably similar indicating that the convergent solution is approximately achieved it should also be noted that the computational costs increase as the mesh becomes finer the time taken for a mesh with a grid spacing of 3 mm 5 mm and 8 mm to calculate a 2 s flow is 32 01 h 3 39 h and 0 95 h respectively therefore the grid convergence test is an effective method to ensure the accuracy of the results and save computing resources 4 application of numerical model the geometry used in this study to investigate the dam break flood problem is illustrated in fig 4 the whole computational region is 14 m long 1 5 m wide and 1 8 m high and it is divided into two parts including a 5 m long reservoir in the upstream and a 9 m long dry bed in the downstream regions a rectangular structure with a size of 0 74 m 0 69 m 0 52 m is located at the center of the bed in the cross direction 3 m away from the reservoir the proposed simulation configuration is a laboratory scale which serves as a simplified experimental analog of dam break flows a dam break can occur for a variety of reasons such as piping seepage foundation settlement and overtopping if a large amount of impoundment is present in the reservoir a dam break incident can induce disastrous consequences to the downstream buildings on the downstream floodplain particularly those near the dam breach can be easily destroyed by the dam break floodwater the rectangular structure used in this work represents a typical solitary one room residential building on the flood plain and its size is reduced in a ratio of 1 6 to that of a real building since the purpose of this paper is to explore the pressure distribution on the wall surface of the structure the openings of a house such as windows and doors were not considered in the simulation in other words the structure was treated as impermeable the boundaries of the computational domain including the upstream end two lateral sides and the bottom were set as a rigid wall as no water flows into out of the computational domain across these boundaries the rectangular structure was also regarded as a solid wall the roughness height of all the wall boundaries was set as 0 005 mm and the roughness constant as 0 5 the no slip condition was defined at the solid boundary and logarithmic velocity distributions were used in the boundary layer the pressure boundary was applied on the upside of the domain since the flow was fully developed and the reflux was not considered in this paper the downstream end was labeled as a free outflow boundary the reservoir contained a water body with a height of h 0 which was designated as the initial condition table 2 lists the five different initial water heights h 0 used in the numerical experiments in the present investigation 0 5 m 0 6 m 0 7 m 0 8 m and 0 9 m the mesh used for the numerical calculation was composed of quadrangular cells a smaller grid cell means that the shape of the structure is closer to the original geometry however an extremely small grid size results in a large number of cells thereby increasing the computational cost in terms of time and storage therefore an appropriate grid size needs to be determined to maintain a balance between the cost and accuracy to this end a smaller grid block surrounding the structure was nested into that of the whole computational domain in general different grid cell sizes can be applied in two grid blocks to satisfy the quantitative limitation of the grid cells and ensure the accurate resolution of the structure shape simultaneously ultimately the small grid block consisted of 385 280 cells with a size of 0 01 m each for the larger grid block the cell size in the x direction was 0 02 m gradually varying cell sizes with a minimum value of 0 02 m and maximum value of 0 1 m were used in both the y and z directions and a total of 2 433 159 cells were obtained more details regarding the mesh are presented in fig 5 as mentioned in section 2 2 the initial time step size was 0 001 s while the time step in the following computation was determined using the courant friedrichs lewy criterion to maintain stability 5 results and discussion 5 1 kinematic analysis the downstream flow in the case involving a structure is more complex than that without a structure to investigate the flow near the structure the typical simulation results of case 1 with an initial water depth h 0 0 5 m in the reservoir are presented three cross sections a a y 1 0 m b b y 0 05 m c c y 1 0 m were considered to measure the water depth as shown in fig 6 5 1 1 water surface evolution the evolution of the water surface near the structure is shown in fig 7 it must be noted that the downstream direction is from right to left as shown in fig 7 a the dam break flood wave reaches the structure at t 0 92 s and the flow remains mostly laminar at t 1 15 s the flood wave bumps against the structure and the main flow is separated into two parts a vertical runup jet along the upstream wall of the structure and a pair of approximately symmetric flows around the structure after some time the jet like flow falls under gravity onto the underlying fluid and the symmetric flows continues moving downstream without converging behind the structure fig 7 c at t 2 30 s the water surface near the upstream wall of the structure fluctuates severely due to the mixing of the reflected flow and the fluid moving downstream at the same time the flows passing around the structure begin to meet and amalgamate into one flow approximately 1 3 m behind the structure a waterless area always exists behind the structure later the fluctuation of the water surface in the upstream of the structure gradually decreases during the propagation of the reflected wave and the dry bed behind the structure is fully occupied by the fluid it can also be observed that the area behind the structure is clearly partitioned into three parts with a triangular part at the center according to the free surface height fig 7 e and f to understand the effects of a structure on the water surface elevation the results of the water depths at three cross sections were considered for the comparison as shown in fig 6 b the three cross sections are close to the structure but are located at different distances as shown in fig 8 a on cross section b b the impact jet generates considerably higher depths in front of the structure than those on both sides without the obstruction reaching a maximum depth of approximately 0 53 m the depths pertaining to section a a are nearly equivalent due to the mostly laminar flow for the c c section the depths at the same distance from x 0 are similar demonstrating that the flows passing around the structure are symmetric subsequently affected by the reflected flow the hydrograph of section a a is no longer a straight line and the depths pertaining to section b b are larger than those for both sections a a and c c see fig 8 b and c because of the decrease in the kinetic energy the hydrograph of section a a resembles a straight line again and its depths begin to get close to those of section b b fig 8 d after the two separated flows join to become one flow the water surface profile on section c c is shaped like a w with a hump in the middle x 0 m fig 8 c and d as described above the structure considerably influences the water surface evolution 1 the shapes of the water surface profile on each section are completely different at the same time 2 the impinging jet and water wave reflected by the structure cause severe turbulence leading to the occurrence of intense fluctuations on the water surface on the same section near the structure 5 1 2 velocity field of the flow near the structure fig 9 shows the velocity components in the streamwise y direction and lateral x direction directions on the water surface near the structure denoted as v y and v x respectively for the simplicity of description before impinging fig 9 a the flow is dominated by the velocity in the y direction and only an extremely small velocity in the x direction appears near the flume wall at t 1 4 s v y in front of the structure decreases rapidly to an extremely small value in addition v x of the symmetric flows mentioned previously can be clearly observed fig 9 b after the falling of the impact jet the superficial fluid in front of the structure begins to advance toward the upstream region with a negative v y fig 9 c and d in addition fig 9 c and d indicate that the distributions of both the flow velocities v y and v x are symmetric behind the structure however in the same zone of the flow field v y and v x increase or decrease along the x axis in exactly the opposite direction before the dry area behind the structure is filled with water the maximum value of v x in the downstream increases from 0 3 m s fig 9 b t 1 4 s to 2 0 m s fig 9 d t 4 s which is approximately 2 3rd the maximum value of v x a slice of the v y contour is shown in fig 10 to provide insight into the motion of the reflected water wave a water curtain with a large negative v y appears when the vertical jet falls after the complete collapse of the water curtain the upper fluid before the structure mainly maintains a negative v y despite this phenomenon the upper fluid is driven back by the main flow from the upstream region fig 10 t 2 50 s and the absolute value of the corresponding v y is reduced at t 3 00 s the absolute v y decreases to 0 and the water surface in front of the structure becomes higher than that of the upstream shortly afterwards another new superficial water wave is generated under gravity and it propagates to the upstream region the longitudinal water profile gradually flattens during the propagation of the wave as shown in fig 7 the distributions of the vertical velocity component during the impact period are presented in fig 11 it can be observed that the vertical movement of the water near the structure is considerably more intense than that in any region far from the structure the maximum vertical upward velocity among that at different instants occurs at the corner in which the main flow changes its direction of movement thereby generating vertical jets in front of the structure the value of the maximum vertical upward velocity can reach approximately 3 0 m s fig 11 a and its order of magnitude is equivalent to that of the horizontal velocity component the falling jet has a negative vertical velocity component and its largest absolute value up to approximately 2 5 m s appears at the position in which the falling jet comes into contact with the surface layer of the incoming flow fig 11 d the fact that the velocity component in the vertical direction can reach such a high value indicates that the water flow motion should be considered as completely three dimensional when investigating the impact problems by numerical means 5 2 impact dynamics analysis in the process of the dam break flood spreading to the downstream region the water first comes into contact with the upstream side surface of the structure as a result the impact pressure acts mainly on this surface several probes were used to explore the impact pressure and the probe locations are presented in fig 12 in the local coordinates 5 2 1 pressure time history fig 13 shows the time series of the pressure at the specified probes under different initial water depths in the reservoir grouped by three vertical directions x 0 03 m x 0 37 m and x 0 71 m for each initial depth it can be noted that the temporal variations of the pressure at the lower and upper positions are considerably different the pressure of the probes at lower positions can be divided into two parts according to the main causes of the pressure 1 the large instantaneous impact pressure generated due to the loss of the kinetic energy of the primary flood water wave as it first impacts the upstream sidewall of the structure and 2 the variation in the hydrostatic pressure with the water depth in front of the structure after the impingement the instantaneous impact pressure is considerably greater than that at any other time stage and it can reach values 1 5 3 0 times that of the maximum pressure after the first impact the pressure of the probes at the upper locations which is mainly hydrostatic is similar to the second type of the pressure at the lower probes a comparison of the pressure changes under five different initial depths h 0 indicates that the height ranges of the probes with a large instantaneous impact pressure on the upstream side surface of the structure are different as shown in fig 13 a and b for both h 0 0 8 m and 0 9 m probes p7 p8 and p9 z 0 09 m correspond to the highest points at which a large instantaneous impact pressure can be detected at the moment that the flow impacts the structure however for h 0 0 7 m a large instantaneous impact pressure can be observed only at probes p4 p5 and p6 z 0 06 m fig 13 c and for h 0 0 6 m and h 0 0 5 m only the lowest probes p1 p2 and p3 z 0 03 m exhibit this phenomenon fig 13 d and e as shown in fig 14 and fig 15 a larger h 0 results in higher water surface and faster flood wave for every 0 1 m increase in h 0 the water surface height increases by 0 06 m on average and the flood wave velocity increases by approximately 0 3 m s therefore the maximum height at which the large instantaneous impact pressure can be measured varies with h 0 5 2 2 peak pressure this section discusses the distribution of the peak pressure on the upstream side surface of the structure by considering the results of the specified probes the changes in the peak pressure along the z axis vertical direction and x axis horizontal direction for h 0 0 7 m are presented in fig 16 a and b respectively as seen from fig 16 a the distribution of the peak pressure in the vertical direction is a curve with the slope gradually changing from steep to gentle indicating that the peak pressure gradient in the vertical direction decreases with the increase in the height the difference between the peak pressure at the probes at z 0 03 m p1 p2 and p3 and z 0 06 m p4 p5 and p6 is the largest among that for all the adjacent probes in the same vertical direction with values of approximately 2 50 kpa for p1 and p4 3 65 kpa for p2 and p5 and 2 45 kpa for p3 and p6 in addition it can be observed that the peak pressures of the probes at the same height along lines x 0 03 m and x 0 71 m are nearly equivalent however the pressure values are lower than those at the same height along line x 0 37 m therefore the pressure peak shows a nearly symmetrical distribution along the x axis as shown in fig 16 b similar to the trend of the vertical distribution the difference between the peak pressures at lines x 0 37 m and x 0 03 m or line x 0 71 m at the same height decreases from the bottom to the top of the upstream side surface of the structure as well fig 16 c for the other values of h 0 0 5 m 0 6 m 0 8 m and 0 9 m the characteristics of the peak pressure distribution described above are similar and are therefore not expounded a comparison of the peak pressure distribution corresponding to different h 0 values along the vertical direction is shown in fig 17 the peak pressure corresponding to different h 0 varies considerably at a height less than 1 5th that of the upstream sidewall of the structure albeit with a smaller diversity at higher positions as h 0 increases by 0 1 m the pressure peak increases by approximately 3 kpa at a height of z 0 03 m while it increases by only 0 3 kpa at z 0 47 m fig 18 shows the comparison of the distribution of the pressure peaks corresponding to different h 0 along the horizontal direction at different heights the variation in the pressure peak caused by the change in h 0 is basically the same at the probes located symmetrically to the middle line x 0 37 m however the variation is greater for probes along the line x 0 37 m in addition the difference between the peak pressures along x 0 37 m and x 0 03 m or x 0 71 m increases with h 0 this tendency can be more clearly observed in fig 19 where the difference is denoted as δp in units of kpa 5 2 3 convergence analysis for impact pressure for the grid convergence test in addition to the gradual mesh with a nested grid block used for all the calculations three other different meshes corresponding to cell sizes of 20 30 and 50 mm are considered all the tests are conducted under the initial condition of h 0 0 7 m the variables with respect to the pressure at p1 p2 and p3 are adopted for the analysis both the pressure and pressure impulse time histories of the impact process are presented in fig 20 the pressure impulse is a meaningful representation for the pressure evolution in time which is defined as the integral of the pressure over the period from time t 0 s to the following time t peregrine 2003 and can be expressed as 9 i x t 0 t p x t d t as seen in fig 20 the overall variations of the pressure from different meshes match well except for the coarsest one moreover the results of the pressure at p1 and p2 exhibit less consistency for the coarsest mesh with respect to those for the other meshes when a coarser mesh 30 mm or 50 mm is used apparent oscillations of the pressure occur at p2 at the impact moment the results of all the meshes indicate that the impact peak pressure obtained by the finer mesh is slightly larger than that obtained using the coarser one according to peregrine 2003 the pressure impulses exhibit a high consistency across different tests however in the simulation tests for meshes involving cells of different sizes except for the agreement of the predicted pressure impulses of all the meshes at p2 significant discrepancies of the pressure impulse appear at p1 and p3 where the pressure impulse of the coarser mesh 30 mm or 50 mm is distinctly lower than that for the finer mesh in particular the pressure impulses at p1 p2 and p3 in the impact duration shorter than 1 7 s are all underestimated compared to those obtained using the coarsest mesh a further quantitative comparison of the pressures with different meshes is given in table 3 two relative deviations marked rd 1 and rd 2 are considered 1 rd 1 represents the relative deviation of the results of each coarser mesh to those of the finest mesh 2 rd 2 is the relative deviation between the solutions obtained using two mesh levels and calculated using ϕ coarser ϕ finer ϕ finer where ϕ coarser and ϕ finer denote the results pertaining to the coarser and finer levels of the two meshes respectively the values of rd 1 for the peak pressure p peak and pressure impulse i 1s increase with the increase in the mesh cell size while the same change in the rd 2 value is noted only for i 1s in terms of the previously mentioned discrepancies of the pressure impulse the values of both rd 1 and rd 2 of i 1s are larger than those of p peak when the coarsest mesh is used which means that the use of excessively large mesh cells can lead to inaccurate results by sorting the meshes of different cell sizes gradual mesh 30 mm and 50 mm according to the absolute values of rd 1 and rd 2 it can be noted that the rd 1 value of the gradual mesh is always the smallest similarly for rd 2 of i 1s the gradual mesh always corresponds to the minimum value as well for rd 2 of p peak the gradual mesh 30 mm mesh and 50 mm mesh have their minimum values at p3 p2 and p1 respectively overall in all the cases rd 1 and rd 2 of the gradual mesh have the minimum values in the maximum number of cases accounting for 86 3 of the total cases which is considerably higher than the occurrences for the other two meshes 30 mm and 50 mm in addition the meshes of different sizes incur different computation times the time required for the 20 mm mesh 30 mm mesh 50 mm mesh and gradual mesh for a 10 s flow simulation is 9 04 h 6 5 h 0 24 h and 7 37 h respectively therefore the gradual mesh was finally adopted in consideration of both the accuracy and reduction of the computational cost 6 conclusion in this paper a 3d numerical model based on the rans equations and rng k ε turbulent closure is applied to investigate the impact of a dam break induced flood on a structure the model is first used to simulate an experiment the comparison between the convergent simulation results and experimental data demonstrates that the present model can predict both the motions and dynamics of the dam break flow next the model is applied to investigate the interaction between the dam break flood water and a solitary structure the impingement makes the water flow considerably turbulent and violent especially in the vicinity of the structure the evolution of the water surface and the distribution of the velocity field indicate that the water movement is completely three dimensional the peak pressure in the initial stage of the impact is significantly high and it can reach values 1 5 3 0 times that of the maximum pressure after the first impact the distributions of the peak pressure on the upstream sidewall of the structure are nonlinear in both the vertical and horizontal directions the value of the peak pressure and nonlinearity of its distribution are proportional to the initial reservoir water depth h 0 in addition the grid convergence tests for the pressure indicate that an excessively coarse mesh may lead to inaccurate results therefore extreme care should be taken when determining a mesh for calculation from the practical engineering point of view the large impact peak pressure should be considered as a key factor of the structural damage in a flood or tsunami prone area the numerical model is promising as an efficient method to predict the water wave induced pressure on a structure and provide suggestions for the practical design and local reinforcement of buildings and structures to improve their resistance to floods credit authorship contribution statement ling peng software data curation writing original draft ting zhang conceptualization methodology

length e g nakamura 1985 sawaragi 1995 liu et al 2013 kim et al 2014b li et al 2017 wake area e g al bourae et al 2013 liu and su 2013 and wake volume e g kim et al 2014a 2016c huang et al 2017 woo et al 2018 wake volume kim et al 2014a is a better measure than wake length or area because it encompasses all wake features kim et al 2016c however wake length and area can be useful when exploring certain characteristics such as flow velocity and intensity in a reference plane kim et al 2014b to identify the flow of water around an ar most studies used particle image velocimetry piv hydrogen bubbles or computational fluid dynamics cfd cfd is often favored because it can simulate several types of water flow at a relatively low cost computationally inexpensive reynolds averaged navier stokes rans models are often used because large eddy simulation les and direct numerical simulation dns require large computational resources however rans modeling requires solutions to ensemble or time averaged navier stokes equations an additional turbulence model is thus essential pope 2012 unfortunately no single practical turbulence model that reliably and accurately predicts all turbulent flows is yet available a turbulence model must be selected according to the numerical framework and researcher experience in most fields of engineering turbulence models are classified as one equation two equation or reynolds stress models rsms rans models can be in the form of eddy turbulence viscosity models based on the boussinesq hypothesis or may employ transport equations for reynolds stresses in the former case reynolds stresses are modeled using eddy or turbulent viscosity this is appropriate for simple turbulent shear flows such as boundary and mixing layers and for channel flows in contrast an rsm is required to derive many terms of the transport equations and is thus more appropriate when dealing with complex three dimensional turbulent flows with large streamline curvature and swirls however rsms are more complex computationally intensive and difficult to converge than eddy viscosity models versteeg and malalasekera 2007 to explore the flow of water around ars two equation cfd models including the standard k ε model and renormalization group rng k ε model have typically been used table 1 similar to other engineering applications katul et al 2004 pope 2012 by definition two equation models include two extra transport equations representing turbulent flow properties the standard k ε model lauder and sharma 1974 is one of the most popular turbulence models for industrial applications but generally performs poorly if the flows exhibit strong separation large streamline curvature or large pressure gradients the rng k ε model yakhot et al 1992 equations are derived using rng theory this model performs better than the k ε model when the shear flow is complex characterized by a high strain rate swirl and separation however this does not necessarily mean that the rng k ε model always performs better than the standard k ε model in terms of analyzing the flow of water around ars model selection is dependent on the target structure under a specific water flow condition for example tang et al 2017 compared three two equation models the standard k ε model the rng k ε model and a realizable k ε model with experimental hydrogen bubble data and found that the standard k ε model generated streamline results very similar to the experimental data similarly maslov et al 2019 compared the results of three two equation models standard k ε and k ω models and a shear stress transport sst k ω scale adaptive simulation sas model to experimental data derived using acoustic doppler velocimetry and found that the k ω model with monotone upwind discretization was optimal piv is an alternative approach to quantify the flow of water around an ar liu et al 2013 li et al 2017 using piv liu et al 2013 obtained the maximum height of the upwelling flow field the average upwelling flow velocity and the length of the back vortex flow of star shaped ars while li et al 2017 acquired the height and area of upwelling flow and the length and area of the back vortex flow of a single tube ar such flow metrics are either one dimensional height or length or two dimensional area piv provides water flow metrics in defined reference planes in this study piv was used to verify the cfd results of the rng k ε model several cfd datasets were generated to identify the effects of ar structure shape and arrangement on upwelling and the wake although the performance of turbulence models used for cfd analysis of ars has been evaluated tang et al 2017 maslov et al 2019 no optimal model has emerged particularly for analysis of wake length and area this is because only a few turbulence models were employed in previous studies none of which explored wake shape it should be emphasized that as well as wake volume wake length and area provide important insights into wake quality kim et al 2014b 2019 wake area and shape are important when deriving a stability index for an ar wake which correlates with ar structural stability kim et al 2016c in this study we investigated five turbulence models four eddy viscosity models and one rsm and compared the cfd and experimental piv data the five turbulence models were as follows 1 a standard k ε model 2 rng k ε model 3 k ω model 4 sst k ω model and 5 rsm for all models the same element structure boundary conditions fluid properties and residual convergence criteria were applied a down scaled half ball type reef model was then subjected to cfd and piv analyses we considered three different inlet flow velocities and thus three reynolds numbers re for each model and compared the cfd and experimental piv data finally we assessed the performance of each model in terms of wake length and shape prediction the following assumptions were made first of the various hydrodynamic forces we considered only water flow currents in the flow analyses we assumed that the water was so deep that waves did not arise second although marine life attached to ars form intricate structures on which fish feed kim et al 2008 we did not consider ar surface roughness or porosity instead analyzing only ar height width length and void third multiple flow directions as induced by tidal changes and wave oscillations were not considered it should be noted that some studies have shown how to measure the effects of flow direction using wake region diagrams kim et al 2016a woo et al 2018 le et al 2020 and efficiency indices kim et al 2016b however these are not relevant to wave induced mechanisms as they focus on multiple flow directions fourth ar stability is a major concern for ar designers woo et al 2014 yoon et al 2016 yun and kim 2018 han et al 2020 however we did not consider ar settlement or washout instead we focused entirely on water flow around the half ball type reef finally regarding the attraction versus production debate among fishery societies pitcher and seaman 2000 bortone 2011 well designed ars have been shown to increase biomass and species productivity noh et al 2017 komyakova et al 2019 lemoine et al 2019 paxton et al 2019 rosa ureta et al 2019 2 materials and methods 2 1 the ar the ar was a half ball type reef hereafter ar02 with a width of 2 m length of 2 m and height of 1 3 m the inside space was empty and the surface was curved the surface area and volume were 14 81 m2 and 0 937 m3 respectively similar to most other ars our ar was made of reinforced concrete lee et al 2018 the down scaled model 1 20 for the piv and cfd analyses is shown in fig 2 ar02s are the most common marine forest artificial reefs mfars in korean waters korea fisheries resources agency 2017 and are easy to fabricate the geometric characteristics of mfars readily block water flow dramatically changing the surrounding flow in 2016 132 163 ar02s covered 10 043 ha 100 43 km2 at a cost of 50 million usd we evaluated an ar02 not only because of its popularity but also because of its effective water blocking mechanism 2 2 piv experiment piv is an optical method that can reveal fluid flow a laser light sheet lls is generated in two dimensions and large numbers of particles are scattered throughout the fluid the lls is less than 1 mm thick and is produced by a pulse laser an instantaneous velocity vector field is acquired by sequentially imaging seed particles using a camera the particles are homogeneously distributed in the fluid and follow the flow perfectly without disturbing it within the interrogation region uniform displacement can be assumed piv is superior to other flow measurement methods in that velocity and direction are captured instantaneously and non coherently at almost all times in a plane of the fluid moreover non coherent flow measurement is optimal with piv some probes distort fluid flow piv is very accurate because flow velocity is averaged over many particles a few rules of thumb must be applied when conducting piv experiments kim 2019 these rules improve the representation of displacement peaks and minimize the loss of particle pairs first the size of the interrogation region should be sufficiently small to be represented by a single vector this limits the velocity gradient if the gradient is too large noise may occur because the displacement peak cannot be estimated accurately second the interrogation region must contain at least 10 particles keane and adrian 1993 drew a curve between the number of particle pairs and the probability of valid detection and concluded that the probability converged when there were more than 10 particle pairs this is because multiple particle pairs contribute greatly to the appearance of displacement peaks noise is reduced so displacement is more obvious third the maximum particle displacement in the interrogation plane should be less than 25 of the size of the interrogation region the 1 4 law this represents a compromise between the maximum and minimum displacement thereby minimizing particle loss and improving accuracy fourth the maximum out of plane displacement should not exceed 25 of the lls thickness to minimize the loss of particle pairs fifth particle displacement in the plane of the interrogation region should be at least twice the particle diameter otherwise the image is elliptical which increases noise and affects the displacement peak finally the laser light should detect particles efficiently laser energy lls dimensions and particle size and material must all be considered for the piv experiment the ar02 was scaled down to 1 20 ar model an open channel was constructed and physical parameters length velocity and time were chosen using the froude similarity method the experimental set up is shown in fig 3 including the green lls and the shadow the overall layout is shown in fig 4 the pulse laser wavelength was 532 nm and the output energy was 100 mj the power view plus 2 mp charge coupled device ccd camera tsi used herein had a resolution of 1 9 million 1600 1192 pixels we collected 750 pairs of image files at 12 hz the particles were glass coated and had a mean diameter of 10 μm the interrogation spots 64 32 pixels are shown in fig 5 the particles were 225 μm in size so there were at least 10 particles in each interrogation spot the horizontal length of the spot was twice the height because the horizontal flow velocity is dominant we acquired 750 pairs of images that were processed by an ensemble algorithm to yield flow velocity vector fields this ensured reliability willert 2008 in the pre processing the particle noise was controlled by a high pass a filter intensity capping and de noising filter according to the rules of thumb e g the 1 4 law one velocity vector representing the corresponding interrogation spot was calculated in the post processing a standard deviation filter and local median filter were used to reduce the random uncertainty in the velocity vector fields flow velocity distributions were obtained at the measurement lines v1 10 as shown in fig 6 in general a wake forms behind an ar and a slow flow region is surrounded by a fast flow region transient flow develops from the point at which the fast and slow flows first meet the turbulent flow turbulence triggers mixing with the near fluid layer and the transitional flow layer rapidly thickens in the transverse direction versteeg and malalasekera 2007 considering these features of wakes the characteristic length was fixed to that of the ar02 model 100 mm thus as shown in table 2 the experimental parameter evaluated was the inlet velocity u 0 we used three inlet velocities 30 0 64 5 and 100 1 mm s 1 with respective re of 2632 re1 5655 re2 and 8782 re3 2 3 cfd analysis in principle the navier stokes equations governing a fluid domain describe both laminar and turbulent flows without the need for any additional information however turbulent flows at realistic re can be very large in terms of length and time thus the finite volume meshes used in numerical analyses tend to be too fine dns of turbulent flows requires computing power many orders of magnitude higher than will be available in the foreseeable future to predict the effects of turbulence many cfd studies have employed turbulence models developed specifically to overcome the problem of prohibitively fine meshes we used cfd analysis to obtain flow wake patterns around the ar02 we used the cfd element based finite volume method ebfvm to derive quantitative data with this method the region of interest is divided into subregions over each of which the governing equations are discretized and iteratively solved hence the value of each variable is obtained at nodal points over the entire domain marcondes and sepehrnoori 2010 dos santos et al 2013 woo et al 2014 ansys cfx software ansys inc 2013 was used for the analysis a steady state rans model was used to evaluate the time averaged flow properties additional equations are required to close the reynolds stress equations by multiplying the fluctuating velocities associated with convective momentum transport by the turbulent eddy versteeg and malalasekera 2007 various turbulence models have been developed to handle the reynolds stress we evaluated five such models 1 a standard k ε model 2 rng k ε model 3 k ω model 4 sst k ω model and 5 rsm all conditions e g element structure boundary conditions fluid properties and residual convergence criteria were identical among the models the standard k ε model is typically used to simulate mean flow characteristics under turbulent flow this two transport equation model provides a general description of turbulence versteeg and malalasekera 2007 the rng k ε model eliminates relatively small scale turbulence from the governing equations using a statistical approach focusing on the effects of large scale motion and eddy viscosity yakhot et al 1992 derived the relevant rng k ε model equations using high re flows the k ω model is another two equation model proposed by wilcox 1988 1993a 1993b 1994 for predicting turbulence it uses two partial differential equations for two variables the turbulence kinetic energy k and specific rate of dissipation ω the sst k ω model combines the k ω and k ε models the first is used to model the inner region of the boundary layer and the second to model the region of free shear flow menter 1992a 1992b 1994 1997 the rsm considers the directional effects of reynolds stresses and complex interactions in turbulent flows rsms are significantly more accurate than eddy viscosity based models and computationally less demanding than dns and les however the computational cost of an rsm is higher than those of the other four models because seven additional partial differential equations must be solved in this study we used the speziale sarkar and gatski ssg rsm model speziale et al 1991 the ar02 model was placed in the flume the cfd analyses are summarized in table 3 the five turbulence models used three inlet velocities 30 0 64 5 100 1 mm s 1 we thus obtained 15 datasets from k ε re1 to rsm re3 re1 re2 and re3 indicate the re of each inlet velocity 2 632 5 655 and 8 782 respectively the flow domain and inlet velocities were identical to those of the piv experiment in general cfd data depend on the size shape and array of an element in particular unstructured or high aspect ratio elements affect solution convergence thus element quality is important our elements were mainly hexahedrons although tetrahedrons were used if hexahedrons were prohibited by the geometry the maximum element length was 2 mm in and near the ar and sequentially increased to 4 and then 20 mm in regions distant from the model fig 7 thus the element growth rate did not exceed 2 there were 3 079 704 and 3 328 356 nodes and elements respectively orthogonal quality oq and skewness skw were calculated using eqs 1 and 2 respectively in ansys cfx 1 o q min a i f i a i f i a i c i a i c i 2 skw max θ m a x θ e 180 θ e θ e θ m i n θ e as shown in fig 8 f i is the vector from the centroid of the element to the face center red solid line a i is a normal vector onto the face blue in the web version solid line c i is a vector from the center of an element to the center of the neighboring element black dotted line and θ e is the equiangle 60 for a triangle and 90 for a square ideally ow and skw should be close to 1 and 0 respectively in this study the average oq was 0 865 very good and the average skw was 0 195 excellent the ranges are shown in table 4 the boundary conditions are shown in fig 9 the inlet boundary x direction boundary indicates the boundary at which the flow emerges at inlet velocities of 30 0 64 5 and 100 1 mm s 1 as measured in the piv experiment the outlet boundary x direction boundary has a no slip wall up to 45 cm in the y direction and an outlet 5 cm above the wall that forces the flow to exit through the outlet in the x direction the no slip wall condition applies to the boundaries of the y and z directions finally the open boundary condition in the y direction allows free fluid flow across the interface overall the outflow flux is equal to the inflow flux grid independence was checked as shown in fig 10 in the test we used rms as a turbulence model and the boundary conditions described above with the inlet velocity of 30 0 mm s 1 re1 as shown the test results tend to converge as the number of nodes increases and the current numerical setup 3 079 704 nodes results in the wake length of 1 06 l which is within 3 difference with respect to the final case 1 03 l with 6 161 787 nodes in addition to increase the precision the solution convergence criterion was selected as 1 10 6 accordingly the criterion was programmed to terminate the process only if it was satisfied during an iteration the cfd analysis reproduced the piv measurement situation as it is in other words the same specifications such as length height and width of the flume used in the piv experiment were taken in particular the height of the water in the tank was implemented in cfd as the water depth and the water depth did not change during the piv experiment the cfd analysis uses the rans equation with a turbulence model as the governing equation in a steady state this technique presents the temporal mean values of the hydrodynamic quantities occurring in the fluid domain in addition the piv experiment is similar to cfd in the way of dealing with time because it presents the average velocity of the seed particles with respect to the time difference δ t of the image pair spatially the cfd and piv techniques divide the space into an element and an interrogation spot respectively in the cfd the grid element means a 3d polyhedron all the average physical quantities in the volume of the polyhedron are stored in the centroid in other words the centroid represents the grid volume domain the remaining space is expressed as an interpolation value with the neighboring centroids in addition the piv technique also divides the space into rectangular areas called interrogation spots the average flow velocity is presented by calculating the moving distance of particles in these interrogation spots as a result we can find similarities between the two techniques in that both the cfd and piv techniques present temporal and spatial average values 3 results and discussion 3 1 experimental results when the re was 2 632 the piv flow structure the velocity vector field was as shown in fig 11 a the shape of the wake region is indicated by the blue in the web version dotted line the vortex core lay at 0 55 l and 0 85 h in the horizontal and vertical directions respectively and the vortex rotated counterclockwise with a re of 5655 fig 11b the wake length decreased to 0 90 l from the 1 05 l at re 2632 the position of the core did not change in the horizontal direction but moved slightly upward the direction of rotation remained almost unchanged at re 8 782 the wake length decreased slightly to 0 85 l fig 11c the vortex core shifted slightly in the horizontal direction the piv data showed that local flow upwelling occurred at the end of the wake region affecting wake shape and length the wake length is important when setting the distance between neighboring ars piv revealed the ar02 wake shape and length we assessed the ability of the five turbulence models to predict the characteristics of an actual wake region to narrow our discussion to wake length the distribution of the normalized velocity u u 0 with normalized height y h and rear distance v i in fig 6 is shown in fig 12 here u is the flow velocity u 0 is the inlet velocity and h is the ar height in the region of y h 1 0 the disturbance of water flow is observed near ar02 e g at v1 and the flow is recovered as progresses e g at v10 on the other hand in the range of 1 0 y h 1 5 we can observe the disturbed flow is recovered according to the increased vertical distance y and accordingly the normalized velocity converges to the prevailing flow velocity u u 0 0 in the region of y h 1 5 thus we can vertically classify the 2 d plane into reef range y h 1 0 stretching range 1 0 y h 1 5 and overhead range y h 1 5 as shown in fig 13 these characteristics can be observed regardless of the reynolds number see fig 12 according to the normalized velocity u u 0 we can also characterize the 2 d plane into tranquility range 1 0 u u 0 1 0 taking into account relatively slow flows opposite flow range u u 0 0 considering negative reverse flow velocities and rage range u u 0 1 0 illustrating relatively fast flows with respect to the inlet velocity as shown in fig 13 considering those six ranges the 2 d plane can be characterized into nine sub planes and accordingly the common region among the reef tranquility and opposite flow ranges indicates the wake region this wake region is characterized by the so called wake length as illustrated in fig 11 in the experimental results wake length decreases up to 19 as the reynolds number inlet velocity increases that is because the local flow upwelling occurred at the end of the wake region affects wake shape and length as shown in fig 11 3 2 numerical results three re were used for the five turbulence models 15 cases the data are shown in figs 14 16 for re of 2 632 5 655 and 8 782 respectively the numerical results are shown as red dotted lines and the experimental results as blue in the web version dotted lines the standard k ε model predicted the occurrence of a vortex but not its position or wake length the model yielded a wake length of 1 24 l and positioned the vortex core at 0 29 l 0 66 h when re 2632 the predicted shape of the wake region differed considerably from the actual shape because the model cannot predict the local upwelling flow which is the key determinant of shape the model predicted little change in wake length even with increasing re the rng model yielded a wake length of 1 36 l but did not predict a vortex when re 2632 the wake length was overestimated and the shape of the wake region was inaccurate because the model did not predict the local upwelling flow when the re increased to 5 655 the model predicted a vortex the core position of which was accurate in the vertical but not the horizontal direction also as the re increased the wake length increased the length was incorrectly predicted particularly at higher re the model also failed to detect local upwelling flow and did not reflect the overall characteristics of the wake region the k ω model yielded a wake length of 1 34 l at re 2632 this decreased with increasing re real decreases were well predicted but the length and shape of the wake region were not furthermore the predicted vertical height of the vortex core was too small thus reducing the height of the wake region the core height decreased as the re increased the k ω model did not predict local upwelling flow or the shape of the wake region the wake length predictions of the sst model were similar to those of the k ω model however wake length was overestimated 1 60 1 51 and 1 44 l with re of 2 632 5 655 and 8 782 respectively the model also failed to predict the position of the vortex core overall the prediction performance was similar to that of the k ω model which also did not predict local upwelling flow the rsm well represented the local upwelling that determines the characteristics of the wake region at re 2 632 divergent flow was evident at the end of the wake region strong upwelling developed as the re increased eventually the shape of the wake region was similar to that in the piv experiment as shown in table 5 wake length was predicted accurately in all cases however the model did not always predict the vortex location accurately although distant vortices were well predicted of the five models the rsm showed the best performance mainly because it well represented local upwelling which is the key factor defining wake shape 3 3 evaluation of flow structure we evaluated flow structure wake region and vortex behind the ar02 the turbulence models predicted the shape and length of the wake region and the vortex patterns differently we compared the results to the piv data table 5 in the piv experiment wake length decreased as the re increased of the five models only the rsm well predicted wake length this observation indicates that it is somewhat difficult to match the wake region resulting from turbulence with the numerical analysis results although there are similarities between the cfd and piv techniques that present temporal and spatial average values that is because the two equation models commonly used in the rans model were less applicable for the wake region e g shape and length estimation as evidence it can be seen that the two equation models do not properly capture the geometric characteristics of the wake region therefore in this study although the computational amount is relatively larger than that of the two equation models the reynolds stress model rsm which directly solves all components of the reynolds stress term resulted in better morphological characteristics of wake regions than the other turbulence models it should be emphasized here that the cfd analysis results were compared based on the shape of wake region and the vortex shown from the piv results in other words each wake region was expressed by connecting the points where the flow velocity vanishes and the turbulence model was qualitatively evaluated from the wake length and the presence of a vortex occurring at the rear of the artificial reef as a result the rsm was considered to be the most advantageous for evaluating the wake region because the rsm was the only model that predicted the divergent flow which determines the specific shape of the wake region in addition it should be noted that both the piv and cfd analyses had certain limitations the piv experiment was performed using three specific inlet velocities or re the maximum experimental velocity was 100 1 mm s 1 considering the 1 20 scaling this corresponds to a real velocity of 0 447 m s 1 which is somewhat lower than the maximum velocity 2 m s 1 used to design ars in south korea however a velocity of 2 m s 1 is used principally to analyze stability sliding and overturning at the design stage on the korean coast the flow velocity is usually about 0 5 m s 1 hence the three inlet velocities reflected real water flows besides it was found from many researchers that the hydrodynamic responses of ars do not change greatly within a certain range of reynolds numbers jiang et al 2016 kim et al 2019 also the resolution of the piv experiment was limited as mentioned above resolution is determined by the size of the interrogation spot which was 14 4 mm 64 pixels in our experiment 14 4 of the length of the ar02 model given that the observational range was 361 269 mm the total resolution was 25 37 pixels which may not be adequate to fully represent the flow of water in the flume the time lapse in ccd camera imaging caused by suboptimal performance of the camera and pulse laser must be decreased several turbulence models have been suggested to obtain the governing equations of rans models a algebraic turbulence zero equation models e g the van driest cebeci smith and baldwin lomax models b one equation models e g actual and modeled turbulence kinetic energy equations and c two equation models e g the k ε and k ω models as we considered only five models our results and conclusions are confined to these models we did not evaluate les or detached eddy simulation des models which are known to provide more accurate results primarily because they employ spatial rather than temporal filtering however given the wide applicability of the rans model the large number of analytical databases available and the relatively low computational cost our work provides meaningful insights into ar design and wake region evaluation 4 conclusion we used five popular turbulence models standard k ε model rng model k ω model sst model and an rsm for cfd analysis of ar02 and compared the data to the piv experimental results in particular the velocity field data were evaluated in terms of flow behind the ar02 we focused on the shape and length of the wake region and the position of the vortex core the piv experiment identified unique wake region shapes attributable to flow divergence local upwelling from the end of the wake region a turbulence model accounting for such divergent flow is required to predict general wake region characteristics the wake lengths obtained in the piv experiments were 1 05 l re1 0 90 l re2 and 0 85 l re3 respectively as the re increased wake length decreased slightly the rsm well reflected this especially when re 2632 difference 1 and re 5655 difference 2 wake length is affected by divergent flow at the end of the wake region one vortex was evident in all three cases and the vortex cores rotated counterclockwise at approximately 0 5 l 0 8 h behind the ar02 the height of the wake region was related to the vortex core position the cfd data showed that the vortex cores were located at the top of wake regions as the re increased the variation of the wake length of the cfd analyses with respect to the piv result tended to increase in all turbulence models for example when re 8782 for the rsm the variation increased to 29 the rsm well predicted the shape of the wake region because it accounted for the divergent flow local upwelling at the end of the region among the five turbulence models the rsm was an optimal model because it represents flow divergence local upwelling and accordingly it predicts the wake lengths it should be noted that the other four turbulence models are two equation models based on the boussinesq relationship the complex flow characteristics of ars are difficult to express using this relationship however the computational cost of the rsm is higher than those of the other four models compared to the standard k ε model the rsm analysis time was 1 93 fold longer and the iteration number was 1 36 fold greater finally we considered only water flow current we will include waves in future analyses because these materially affect ars in shallow waters credit authorship contribution statement dongha kim methodology software investigation resources

21019,many studies have evaluated the performance of turbulence models used for computational fluid dynamics cfd analysis of artificial reefs ars but an optimal model remains elusive particularly in terms of wake length and areal estimation only a few models were used in previous studies and no report has yet investigated wake shape we compared five turbulence models and verified the cfd results using particle image velocimetry piv a standard k ε model renormalization group k ε model k ω model shear stress transportation k ω model and reynolds stress model rsm were used a down scaled half

lengths obtained in the piv experiments were 1 05 l re 2632 0 90 l re 5655 and 0 85 l re 8782 respectively the rsm well reflected this especially when re 2632 difference 1 and re 5655 difference 2 piv revealed that all wake regions had unique shapes reflecting flow divergence local upwelling from the end of the wake considering such divergent flow the rsm optimally predicted the overall

of an ar with the prevailing current water flow dotted line in fig 1 the size of the wake region and flow intensity are important for ar functionality and aggregation of marine species liao et al 2003 ono and deguchi 2003 hockley et al 2014 huang et al 2019 thus it is important to quantify the size of the wake as mentioned above many studies aimed to quantify the wake region based on the wake

al 2018 wake volume kim et al 2014a is a better measure than wake length or area because it encompasses all wake features kim et al 2016c however wake length and area can be useful when exploring certain characteristics such as flow velocity and intensity in a reference plane kim et al 2014b to identify the flow of water around an ar most studies used particle image velocimetry piv hydrogen bubbles or computational fluid dynamics cfd cfd is often favored because it can simulate several types of water flow at a relatively low cost computationally inexpensive reynolds averaged navier stokes rans models are often used because large eddy simulation les and direct numerical simulation dns require large computational resources however rans modeling requires solutions to ensemble or time averaged navier stokes equations an additional turbulence model is thus essential pope 2012 unfortunately no single practical turbulence model that reliably and accurately predicts all turbulent flows is yet available a turbulence model must be selected according to the numerical framework and researcher experience in most fields of engineering turbulence models are classified as one equation two equation or reynolds stress models rsms rans models can be in the form of eddy turbulence viscosity models based on the boussinesq hypothesis or may employ transport equations for reynolds stresses in the former case reynolds stresses are modeled using eddy or turbulent viscosity this is appropriate for simple turbulent shear flows such as boundary and mixing layers and for channel flows in contrast an rsm is required to derive many terms of the transport equations and is thus more appropriate when dealing with complex three dimensional turbulent flows with large streamline curvature and swirls however rsms are more complex computationally intensive and difficult to converge than eddy viscosity models versteeg and malalasekera 2007 to explore the flow of water around ars two equation cfd models including the standard k ε model and renormalization group rng k ε model have typically been used table 1 similar to other engineering applications katul et al 2004 pope 2012 by definition two equation models include two extra transport equations representing turbulent flow properties the standard k ε model lauder and sharma 1974 is one of the most popular turbulence models for industrial applications but generally performs poorly if the flows exhibit strong separation large streamline curvature or large pressure gradients the rng k ε model yakhot et al 1992 equations are derived using rng theory this model performs better than the k ε model when the shear flow is complex characterized by a high strain rate swirl and separation however this does not necessarily mean that the rng k ε model always performs better than the standard k ε model in terms of analyzing the flow of water around ars model selection is dependent on the target structure under a specific water flow condition for example tang et al 2017 compared three two equation models the standard k ε model the rng k ε model and a realizable k ε model with experimental hydrogen bubble data and found that the standard k ε model generated streamline results very similar to the experimental data similarly maslov et al 2019 compared the results of three two equation models standard k ε and k ω models and a shear stress transport sst k ω scale adaptive simulation sas model to experimental data derived using acoustic doppler velocimetry and found that the k ω model with monotone upwind discretization was optimal piv is an alternative approach to quantify the flow of water around an ar liu et al 2013 li et al 2017 using piv liu et al 2013 obtained the maximum height of the upwelling flow field the average upwelling flow velocity and the length of the back vortex flow of star shaped ars while li et al 2017 acquired the height and area of upwelling flow and the length and area of the back vortex flow of a single tube ar such flow metrics are either one dimensional height or length or two dimensional area piv provides water flow metrics in defined reference planes in this study piv was used to verify the cfd results of the rng k ε model several cfd datasets were generated to identify the effects of ar structure shape and arrangement on upwelling and the wake although the performance of turbulence models used for cfd analysis of ars has been evaluated tang et al 2017 maslov et al 2019 no optimal model has emerged particularly for analysis of wake length and area this is because only a few turbulence models were employed in previous studies none of which explored wake shape it should be emphasized that as well as wake volume wake length and area provide important insights into wake quality kim et al 2014b 2019 wake area and shape are important when deriving a stability index for an ar wake which correlates with ar structural stability kim et al 2016c in this study we investigated five turbulence models four eddy viscosity models and one rsm and compared the cfd and experimental piv data the five turbulence models were as follows 1 a standard k ε model 2 rng k ε model 3 k ω model 4 sst k ω model and 5 rsm for all models the same element structure boundary conditions fluid properties and residual convergence criteria were applied a down scaled half ball type reef model was then subjected to cfd and piv analyses we considered three different inlet flow velocities and thus three reynolds numbers re for each model and compared the cfd and experimental piv data finally we assessed the performance of each model in terms of wake length and shape prediction the following assumptions were made first of the various hydrodynamic forces we considered only water flow currents in the flow analyses we assumed that the water was so deep that waves did not arise second although marine life attached to ars form intricate structures on which fish feed kim et al 2008 we did not consider ar surface roughness or porosity instead analyzing only ar height width length and void third multiple flow directions as induced by tidal changes and wave oscillations were not considered it should be noted that some studies have shown how to measure the effects of flow direction using wake region diagrams kim et al 2016a woo et al 2018 le et al 2020 and efficiency indices kim et al 2016b however these are not relevant to wave induced mechanisms as they focus on multiple flow directions fourth ar stability is a major concern for ar designers woo et al 2014 yoon et al 2016 yun and kim 2018 han et al 2020 however we did not consider ar settlement or washout instead we focused entirely on water flow around the half ball type reef finally regarding the attraction versus production debate among fishery societies pitcher and seaman 2000 bortone 2011 well designed ars have been shown to increase biomass and species productivity noh et al 2017 komyakova et al 2019 lemoine et al 2019 paxton et al 2019 rosa ureta et al 2019 2 materials and methods 2 1 the ar the ar was a half ball type reef hereafter ar02 with a width of 2 m length of 2 m and height of 1 3 m the inside space was empty and the surface was curved the surface area and volume were 14 81 m2 and 0 937 m3 respectively similar to most other ars our ar was made of reinforced concrete lee et al 2018 the down scaled model 1 20 for the piv and cfd analyses is shown in fig 2 ar02s are the most common marine forest artificial reefs mfars in korean waters korea fisheries resources agency 2017 and are easy to fabricate the geometric characteristics of mfars readily block water flow dramatically changing the surrounding flow in 2016 132 163 ar02s covered 10 043 ha 100 43 km2 at a cost of 50 million usd we evaluated an ar02 not only because of its popularity but also because of its effective water blocking mechanism 2 2 piv experiment piv is an optical method that can reveal fluid flow a laser light sheet lls is generated in two dimensions and large numbers of particles are scattered throughout the fluid the lls is less than 1 mm thick and is produced by a pulse laser an instantaneous velocity vector field is acquired by sequentially imaging seed particles using a camera the particles are homogeneously distributed in the fluid and follow the flow perfectly without disturbing it within the interrogation region uniform displacement can be assumed piv is superior to other flow measurement methods in that velocity and direction are captured instantaneously and non coherently at almost all times in a plane of the fluid moreover non coherent flow measurement is optimal with piv some probes distort fluid flow piv is very accurate because flow velocity is averaged over many particles a few rules of thumb must be applied when conducting piv experiments kim 2019 these rules improve the representation of displacement peaks and minimize the loss of particle pairs first the size of the interrogation region should be sufficiently small to be represented by a single vector this limits the velocity gradient if the gradient is too large noise may occur because the displacement peak cannot be estimated accurately second the interrogation region must contain at least 10 particles keane and adrian 1993 drew a curve between the number of particle pairs and the probability of valid detection and concluded that the probability converged when there were more than 10 particle pairs this is because multiple particle pairs contribute greatly to the appearance of displacement peaks noise is reduced so displacement is more obvious third the maximum particle displacement in the interrogation plane should be less than 25 of the size of the interrogation region the 1 4 law this represents a compromise between the maximum and minimum displacement thereby minimizing particle loss and improving accuracy fourth the maximum out of plane displacement should not exceed 25 of the lls thickness to minimize the loss of particle pairs fifth particle displacement in the plane of the interrogation region should be at least twice the particle diameter otherwise the image is elliptical which increases noise and affects the displacement peak finally the laser light should detect particles efficiently laser energy lls dimensions and particle size and material must all be considered for the piv experiment the ar02 was scaled down to 1 20 ar model an open channel was constructed and physical parameters length velocity and time were chosen using the froude similarity method the experimental set up is shown in fig 3 including the green lls and the shadow the overall layout is shown in fig 4 the pulse laser wavelength was 532 nm and the output energy was 100 mj the power view plus 2 mp charge coupled device ccd camera tsi used herein had a resolution of 1 9 million 1600 1192 pixels we collected 750 pairs of image files at 12 hz the particles were glass coated and had a mean diameter of 10 μm the interrogation spots 64 32 pixels are shown in fig 5 the particles were 225 μm in size so there were at least 10 particles in each interrogation spot the horizontal length of the spot was twice the height because the horizontal flow velocity is dominant we acquired 750 pairs of images that were processed by an ensemble algorithm to yield flow velocity vector fields this ensured reliability willert 2008 in the pre processing the particle noise was controlled by a high pass a filter intensity capping and de noising filter according to the rules of thumb e g the 1 4 law one velocity vector representing the corresponding interrogation spot was calculated in the post processing a standard deviation filter and local median filter were used to reduce the random uncertainty in the velocity vector fields flow velocity distributions were obtained at the measurement lines v1 10 as shown in fig 6 in general a wake forms behind an ar and a slow flow region is surrounded by a fast flow region transient flow develops from the point at which the fast and slow flows first meet the turbulent flow turbulence triggers mixing with the near fluid layer and the transitional flow layer rapidly thickens in the transverse direction versteeg and malalasekera 2007 considering these features of wakes the characteristic length was fixed to that of the ar02 model 100 mm thus as shown in table 2 the experimental parameter evaluated was the inlet velocity u 0 we used three inlet velocities 30 0 64 5 and 100 1 mm s 1 with respective re of 2632 re1 5655 re2 and 8782 re3 2 3 cfd analysis in principle the navier stokes equations governing a fluid domain describe both laminar and turbulent flows without the need for any additional information however turbulent flows at realistic re can be very large in terms of length and time thus the finite volume meshes used in numerical analyses tend to be too fine dns of turbulent flows requires computing power many orders of magnitude higher than will be available in the foreseeable future to predict the effects of turbulence many cfd studies have employed turbulence models developed specifically to overcome the problem of prohibitively fine meshes we used cfd analysis to obtain flow wake patterns around the ar02 we used the cfd element based finite volume method ebfvm to derive quantitative data with this method the region of interest is divided into subregions over each of which the governing equations are discretized and iteratively solved hence the value of each variable is obtained at nodal points over the entire domain marcondes and sepehrnoori 2010 dos santos et al 2013 woo et al 2014 ansys cfx software ansys inc 2013 was used for the analysis a steady state rans model was used to evaluate the time averaged flow properties additional equations are required to close the reynolds stress equations by multiplying the fluctuating velocities associated with convective momentum transport by the turbulent eddy versteeg and malalasekera 2007 various turbulence models have been developed to handle the reynolds stress we evaluated five such models 1 a standard k ε model 2 rng k ε model 3 k ω model 4 sst k ω model and 5 rsm all conditions e g element structure boundary conditions fluid properties and residual convergence criteria were identical among the models the standard k ε model is typically used to simulate mean flow characteristics under turbulent flow this two transport equation model provides a general description of turbulence versteeg and malalasekera 2007 the rng k ε model eliminates relatively small scale turbulence from the governing equations using a statistical approach focusing on the effects of large scale motion and eddy viscosity yakhot et al 1992 derived the relevant rng k ε model equations using high re flows the k ω model is another two equation model proposed by wilcox 1988 1993a 1993b 1994 for predicting turbulence it uses two partial differential equations for two variables the turbulence kinetic energy k and specific rate of dissipation ω the sst k ω model combines the k ω and k ε models the first is used to model the inner region of the boundary layer and the second to model the region of free shear flow menter 1992a 1992b 1994 1997 the rsm considers the directional effects of reynolds stresses and complex interactions in turbulent flows rsms are significantly more accurate than eddy viscosity based models and computationally less demanding than dns and les however the computational cost of an rsm is higher than those of the other four models because seven additional partial differential equations must be solved in this study we used the speziale sarkar and gatski ssg rsm model speziale et al 1991 the ar02 model was placed in the flume the cfd analyses are summarized in table 3 the five turbulence models used three inlet velocities 30 0 64 5 100 1 mm s 1 we thus obtained 15 datasets from k ε re1 to rsm re3 re1 re2 and re3 indicate the re of each inlet velocity 2 632 5 655 and 8 782 respectively the flow domain and inlet velocities were identical to those of the piv experiment in general cfd data depend on the size shape and array of an element in particular unstructured or high aspect ratio elements affect solution convergence thus element quality is important our elements were mainly hexahedrons although tetrahedrons were used if hexahedrons were prohibited by the geometry the maximum element length was 2 mm in and near the ar and sequentially increased to 4 and then 20 mm in regions distant from the model fig 7 thus the element growth rate did not exceed 2 there were 3 079 704 and 3 328 356 nodes and elements respectively orthogonal quality oq and skewness skw were calculated using eqs 1 and 2 respectively in ansys cfx 1 o q min a i f i a i f i a i c i a i c i 2 skw max θ m a x θ e 180 θ e θ e θ m i n θ e as shown in fig 8 f i is the vector from the centroid of the element to the face center red solid line a i is a normal vector onto the face blue in the web version solid line c i is a vector from the center of an element to the center of the neighboring element black dotted line and θ e is the equiangle 60 for a triangle and 90 for a square ideally ow and skw should be close to 1 and 0 respectively in this study the average oq was 0 865 very good and the average skw was 0 195 excellent the ranges are shown in table 4 the boundary conditions are shown in fig 9 the inlet boundary x direction boundary indicates the boundary at which the flow emerges at inlet velocities of 30 0 64 5 and 100 1 mm s 1 as measured in the piv experiment the outlet boundary x direction boundary has a no slip wall up to 45 cm in the y direction and an outlet 5 cm above the wall that forces the flow to exit through the outlet in the x direction the no slip wall condition applies to the boundaries of the y and z directions finally the open boundary condition in the y direction allows free fluid flow across the interface overall the outflow flux is equal to the inflow flux grid independence was checked as shown in fig 10 in the test we used rms as a turbulence model and the boundary conditions described above with the inlet velocity of 30 0 mm s 1 re1 as shown the test results tend to converge as the number of nodes increases and the current numerical setup 3 079 704 nodes results in the wake length of 1 06 l which is within 3 difference with respect to the final case 1 03 l with 6 161 787 nodes in addition to increase the precision the solution convergence criterion was selected as 1 10 6 accordingly the criterion was programmed to terminate the process only if it was satisfied during an iteration the cfd analysis reproduced the piv measurement situation as it is in other words the same specifications such as length height and width of the flume used in the piv experiment were taken in particular the height of the water in the tank was implemented in cfd as the water depth and the water depth did not change during the piv experiment the cfd analysis uses the rans equation with a turbulence model as the governing equation in a steady state this technique presents the temporal mean values of the hydrodynamic quantities occurring in the fluid domain in addition the piv experiment is similar to cfd in the way of dealing with time because it presents the average velocity of the seed particles with respect to the time difference δ t of the image pair spatially the cfd and piv techniques divide the space into an element and an interrogation spot respectively in the cfd the grid element means a 3d polyhedron all the average physical quantities in the volume of the polyhedron are stored in the centroid in other words the centroid represents the grid volume domain the remaining space is expressed as an interpolation value with the neighboring centroids in addition the piv technique also divides the space into rectangular areas called interrogation spots the average flow velocity is presented by calculating the moving distance of particles in these interrogation spots as a result we can find similarities between the two techniques in that both the cfd and piv techniques present temporal and spatial average values 3 results and discussion 3 1 experimental results when the re was 2 632 the piv flow structure the velocity vector field was as shown in fig 11 a the shape of the wake region is indicated by the blue in the web version dotted line the vortex core lay at 0 55 l and 0 85 h in the horizontal and vertical directions respectively and the vortex rotated counterclockwise with a re of 5655 fig 11b the wake length decreased to 0 90 l from the 1 05 l at re 2632 the position of the core did not change in the horizontal direction but moved slightly upward the direction of rotation remained almost unchanged at re 8 782 the wake length decreased slightly to 0 85 l fig 11c the vortex core shifted slightly in the horizontal direction the piv data showed that local flow upwelling occurred at the end of the wake region affecting wake shape and length the wake length is important when setting the distance between neighboring ars piv revealed the ar02 wake shape and length we assessed the ability of the five turbulence models to predict the characteristics of an actual wake region to narrow our discussion to wake length the distribution of the normalized velocity u u 0 with normalized height y h and rear distance v i in fig 6 is shown in fig 12 here u is the flow velocity u 0 is the inlet velocity and h is the ar height in the region of y h 1 0 the disturbance of water flow is observed near ar02 e g at v1 and the flow is recovered as progresses e g at v10 on the other hand in the range of 1 0 y h 1 5 we can observe the disturbed flow is recovered according to the increased vertical distance y and accordingly the normalized velocity converges to the prevailing flow velocity u u 0 0 in the region of y h 1 5 thus we can vertically classify the 2 d plane into reef range y h 1 0 stretching range 1 0 y h 1 5 and overhead range y h 1 5 as shown in fig 13 these characteristics can be observed regardless of the reynolds number see fig 12 according to the normalized velocity u u 0 we can also characterize the 2 d plane into tranquility range 1 0 u u 0 1 0 taking into account relatively slow flows opposite flow range u u 0 0 considering negative reverse flow velocities and rage range u u 0 1 0 illustrating relatively fast flows with respect to the inlet velocity as shown in fig 13 considering those six ranges the 2 d plane can be characterized into nine sub planes and accordingly the common region among the reef tranquility and opposite flow ranges indicates the wake region this wake region is characterized by the so called wake length as illustrated in fig 11 in the experimental results wake length decreases up to 19 as the reynolds number inlet velocity increases that is because the local flow upwelling occurred at the end of the wake region affects wake shape and length as shown in fig 11 3 2 numerical results three re were used for the five turbulence models 15 cases the data are shown in figs 14 16 for re of 2 632 5 655 and 8 782 respectively the numerical results are shown as red dotted lines and the experimental results as blue in the web version dotted lines the standard k ε model predicted the occurrence of a vortex but not its position or wake length the model yielded a wake length of 1 24 l and positioned the vortex core at 0 29 l 0 66 h when re 2632 the predicted shape of the wake region differed considerably from the actual shape because the model cannot predict the local upwelling flow which is the key determinant of shape the model predicted little change in wake length even with increasing re the rng model yielded a wake length of 1 36 l but did not predict a vortex when re 2632 the wake length was overestimated and the shape of the wake region was inaccurate because the model did not predict the local upwelling flow when the re increased to 5 655 the model predicted a vortex the core position of which was accurate in the vertical but not the horizontal direction also as the re increased the wake length increased the length was incorrectly predicted particularly at higher re the model also failed to detect local upwelling flow and did not reflect the overall characteristics of the wake region the k ω model yielded a wake length of 1 34 l at re 2632 this decreased with increasing re real decreases were well predicted but the length and shape of the wake region were not furthermore the predicted vertical height of the vortex core was too small thus reducing the height of the wake region the core height decreased as the re increased the k ω model did not predict local upwelling flow or the shape of the wake region the wake length predictions of the sst model were similar to those of the k ω model however wake length was overestimated 1 60 1 51 and 1 44 l with re of 2 632 5 655 and 8 782 respectively the model also failed to predict the position of the vortex core overall the prediction performance was similar to that of the k ω model which also did not predict local upwelling flow the rsm well represented the local upwelling that determines the characteristics of the wake region at re 2 632 divergent flow was evident at the end of the wake region strong upwelling developed as the re increased eventually the shape of the wake region was similar to that in the piv experiment as shown in table 5 wake length was predicted accurately in all cases however the model did not always predict the vortex location accurately although distant vortices were well predicted of the five models the rsm showed the best performance mainly because it well represented local upwelling which is the key factor defining wake shape 3 3 evaluation of flow structure we evaluated flow structure wake region and vortex behind the ar02 the turbulence models predicted the shape and length of the wake region and the vortex patterns differently we compared the results to the piv data table 5 in the piv experiment wake length decreased as the re increased of the five models only the rsm well predicted wake length this observation indicates that it is somewhat difficult to match the wake region resulting from turbulence with the numerical analysis results although there are similarities between the cfd and piv techniques that present temporal and spatial average values that is because the two equation models commonly used in the rans model were less applicable for the wake region e g shape and length estimation as evidence it can be seen that the two equation models do not properly capture the geometric characteristics of the wake region therefore in this study although the computational amount is relatively larger than that of the two equation models the reynolds stress model rsm which directly solves all components of the reynolds stress term resulted in better morphological characteristics of wake regions than the other turbulence models it should be emphasized here that the cfd analysis results were compared based on the shape of wake region and the vortex shown from the piv results in other words each wake region was expressed by connecting the points where the flow velocity vanishes and the turbulence model was qualitatively evaluated from the wake length and the presence of a vortex occurring at the rear of the artificial reef as a result the rsm was considered to be the most advantageous for evaluating the wake region because the rsm was the only model that predicted the divergent flow which determines the specific shape of the wake region in addition it should be noted that both the piv and cfd analyses had certain limitations the piv experiment was performed using three specific inlet velocities or re the maximum experimental velocity was 100 1 mm s 1 considering the 1 20 scaling this corresponds to a real velocity of 0 447 m s 1 which is somewhat lower than the maximum velocity 2 m s 1 used to design ars in south korea however a velocity of 2 m s 1 is used principally to analyze stability sliding and overturning at the design stage on the korean coast the flow velocity is usually about 0 5 m s 1 hence the three inlet velocities reflected real water flows besides it was found from many researchers that the hydrodynamic responses of ars do not change greatly within a certain range of reynolds numbers jiang et al 2016 kim et al 2019 also the resolution of the piv experiment was limited as mentioned above resolution is determined by the size of the interrogation spot which was 14 4 mm 64 pixels in our experiment 14 4 of the length of the ar02 model given that the observational range was 361 269 mm the total resolution was 25 37 pixels which may not be adequate to fully represent the flow of water in the flume the time lapse in ccd camera imaging caused by suboptimal performance of the camera and pulse laser must be decreased several turbulence models have been suggested to obtain the governing equations of rans models a algebraic turbulence zero equation models e g the van driest cebeci smith and baldwin lomax models b one equation models e g actual and modeled turbulence kinetic energy equations and c two equation models e g the k ε and k ω models as we considered only five models our results and conclusions are confined to these models we did not evaluate les or detached eddy simulation des models which are known to provide more accurate results primarily because they employ spatial rather than temporal filtering however given the wide applicability of the rans model the large number of analytical databases available and the relatively low computational cost our work provides meaningful insights into ar design and wake region evaluation 4 conclusion we used five popular turbulence models standard k ε model rng model k ω model sst model and an rsm for cfd analysis of ar02 and compared the data to the piv experimental results in particular the velocity field data were evaluated in terms of flow behind the ar02 we focused on the shape and length of the wake region and the position of the vortex core the piv experiment identified unique wake region shapes attributable to flow divergence local upwelling from the end of the wake region a turbulence model accounting for such divergent flow is required to predict general wake region characteristics the wake lengths obtained in the piv experiments were 1 05 l re1 0 90 l re2 and 0 85 l re3 respectively as the re increased wake length decreased slightly the rsm well reflected this especially when re 2632 difference 1 and re 5655 difference 2 wake length is affected by divergent flow at the end of the wake region one vortex was evident in all three cases and the vortex cores rotated counterclockwise at approximately 0 5 l 0 8 h behind the ar02 the height of the wake region was related to the vortex core position the cfd data showed that the vortex cores were located at the top of wake regions as the re increased the variation of the wake length of the cfd analyses with respect to the piv result tended to increase in all turbulence models for example when re 8782 for the rsm the variation increased to 29 the rsm well predicted the shape of the wake region because it accounted for the divergent flow local upwelling at the end of the region among the five turbulence models the rsm was an optimal model because it represents flow divergence local upwelling and accordingly it predicts the wake lengths it should be noted that the other four turbulence models are two equation models based on the boussinesq relationship the complex flow characteristics of ars are difficult to express using this relationship however the computational cost of the rsm is higher than those of the other four models compared to the standard k ε model the rsm analysis time was 1 93 fold longer and the iteration number was 1 36 fold greater finally we considered only water flow current we will include waves in future analyses because these materially affect ars in shallow waters credit authorship contribution statement dongha kim methodology software investigation resources
