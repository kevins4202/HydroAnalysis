12115,groundwater aquifer in halabja saidsadiq basin considered as one of the most important aquifers in terms of water supplying in kurdistan region ne of iraq the growing of economics irrigation and agricultural activities inside the basin makes it of the main essentials to the region therefore pollution of groundwater is of specific worry as groundwater resources are the principal source of water for drinking agriculture irrigation and industrial activities thus the best and practical arrangement is to keep the pollution of groundwater through the current study aims to evaluate of the vulnerability of groundwater aquifers of the study area two models were applied to be specific vlda and cop to develop maps of groundwater vulnerability for contamination the vlda model classified the area into four classes of vulnerability low moderate high and very high with coverage area of 2 44 53 and 1 respectively while four vulnerability classes were accomplished dependent on cop model including very low low moderate and high vulnerability classes with coverage areas of 1 37 2 and 60 respectively to confirm the suitability of each map for assessment of groundwater vulnerability in

region ne of iraq in terms of groundwater aquifers the concentration of economic agricultural and social activities within the basin makes it of prime significance to the region exhaustive agricultural activities are extensive and located close to groundwater wells which pose imminent threats to these resources moreover the authoritative structure of halabja has been changed from a district to governorate in march 2014 this will improve the start of more economic improvement and progression in perspective of these progressions there is an expansion of the quantities of human making a beeline for live in this basin and its surrounding areas this is forcing a developing interest in water which has set significant weights on water resources therefore groundwater contamination is of particular concern as groundwater resources are the principal source of water for drinking agriculture irrigation and industrial activities groundwater vulnerability is evaluating the ability of pollutant to transport from the earth surface to reach a productive aquifer the vulnerability studies can supply precious information about stakeholder working on preventing further deterioration of the environment mendoza and barmen 2006 to simplify the identification of the groundwater condition and to resist the pollutants in the reservoirs several methods were recommended such as drastic vlda cop god sintacs etc these different methods are offered under the form of numerical excerpt systems based on the negotiation of the different factors affecting the hydrogeological system attoui et al 2012 different vulnerability models were applied previously for the studied area while it is very important to confirm the computed vulnerability model is reflecting the real vulnerability system for the area so the main objective of the current study is to compare the achieved vulnerability map from two different models namely vlda lithology of vadose zone v pattern of land use l groundwater depth d and aquifer characteristics a and cop flow concentration c overly layers o and precipitation p in order to select more sensible model to be applied for the area 1 1 study area the study basin is located in the northeastern part of iraq geographically it is located between the latitude 560 000 600 0000 and the longitude 3 880 000 3940 000 fig 1 the entire study area is about 1278 square kilometers and its population of early 2015 of about 190 727 this basin divided into two sub basins by ali 2007 including halabja khurmal and said sadiq sub basins approximately 57 of the studied area is an arable area due to its suitability for agriculture statistical 2014 1 2 geology and hydrogeological setting different geological formations were exposed in this basin these formations consist of limestone dolomitic limestone and conglomerate which have an effective role in the vulnerability system in the basin fig 2 alluvial quaternary deposits are the most important unit in the area in terms of hydrogeological characteristics and water supply the thickness of these deposits as observed by abdullah et al 2015a of about nearly 300 m hydrogeologically different groundwater aquifers exist in the area based on its geological background table 1 and fig 3 the mountain series which surround the basin of the northeast and southeast are characterized by high depth of groundwater while toward the center and the southeastern part the groundwater level has a relatively lower depth a groundwater movement is usually from high elevated areas at the north northeast south and southeast towards southwest or generally toward the reservoir of derbandikhan dam 2 methodology two different models have been applied with the aid of gis technique in order to map groundwater vulnerability in the study area the first applied model is vlda predominantly it reflects lithology of vadose zone v pattern of land use l groundwater depth d and aquifer characteristics a zhou et al 2012 in addition reliable weight can be assigned to each of the four indices depending on its impact on groundwater vulnerability the vulnerability comprehensive assessment index di is the sum of the above mentioned weighted four indices as computed conferring to the following formula zhou et al 2012 1 d i j 1 4 wijrij where di is the comprehensive assessment index wij is the weight of the jth comprehensive assessment index of the ith sub system rij is the value of the jth assessment index of the ith subsystem 4 is the quantity of indices the lower the di signifier to the lower vulnerability of the groundwater system and the superior the stability will be to assess the groundwater vulnerability the new corresponding weights in hsb were proposed using sensitivity analysis method abdullah et al 2015b based on the result of sensitivity analysis the proposed weights used for vlda model measured as 8 2 4 8 5 2 and 4 8 and after normalization the weight is 0 357 0 209 0 226 and 0 209 respectively abdullah et al 2016a the second applied model is cop its contraction comes from the three initials of parameters namely flow concentration c overly layers o and precipitation p vias et al 2006 the hypothetical basis of this strategy as indicated by the european approach daly et al 2002 and goldscheider and popescu 2004 it is to evaluate the ordinary protection for groundwater o variable controlled by the properties of overly soils and the unsaturated zone and also to measure how this assurance can be adjusted by diffuse infiltration c factor and the climatic conditions p factor precipitation the cop index map was computed from equation 2 abdullah et al 2016b and vias et al 2006 2 cop index map c o p finally the vulnerability of groundwater to contamination was evaluated by comparing vulnerability index value with the age of groundwater region of recent recharge are liable to contamination from surface waters 3 result and discousions subsequent to the weighted scores were achieved for all parameters in each model the gis technique was used to combine all layers the result of groundwater vulnerability mapping can be summarizing as follow the vulnerability result based on vlda model illustrates that a total of four ranges of vulnerability indices had been distinguished ranging from low on very high with vulnerability indices 2 133 4 4 6 6 8 and 8 fig 4 the area of low and very high vulnerability zones to occupy 2 and 1 of the whole study area respectively the high vulnerability classes covered most of the mountains area that surrounding the area and the central part of hsb this vulnerability zone covered an area of 53 of whole area medium vulnerability zones to cover an area of 44 of all studied area and positioned southeast and northwest both high and moderate classes that occupied most of the studied basins refer to the exhaustive human activities good water yield property and lithological composition of existed aquifers four categories of vulnerability ranging from very low to high are achieved according to the cop model fig 5 high vulnerability areas covering an area of 60 of the entire hsb geologically includes the fissure zone and minor carbonate karstic rocks while the low vulnerability class comes in second place and occupies 37 of the entire region this region is predominantly characterized by alluvial sediments the area with moderate and very low vulnerable groups covers only 2 and 1 of the total area respectively 4 validation of the result various methods endure for evaluation dating from groundwater age the method applied to estimate groundwater method in this study is the tritium unstable isotopes tritium or 3h is a radioactive isotope of hydrogen through one proton and two neutrons with a half life of 12 4 year kumar and somashekar 2011 concentrations of tritium are deliberate in tritium units tu where 1 tu is described as the occurrence of one tritium in 1018 atoms of hydrogen h in the present study tritium unstable isotope analyzed from one rain sample and twenty water well samples from different groundwater aquifers to find out the groundwater age rain sample had a tritium value of 4 8 tu and a mean value of groundwater samples were 4 28 tu for ckfa tka and jka aquifers and 2 28 and 3 03 tu for cfa and aia aquifers respectively table 2 there is no definite classification for age estimation based on tritium results while mckenzie jeffrey et al 2010 classified the age of groundwater samples by classifying water as being modern and pre bomb tritium values of more than 0 3 tu are considered as modern water i e recharge after 1965 and values smaller than or equal to 0 3 tu to considered to be pre bomb spikes to recharge i e recharge before 1965 while 31 classified groundwater age as follows 0 8 tu assigns sub modern water prior to 1950s 0 8 to 5 tu assigns a mix of sub modern and modern water 5 to 15 tu assigns modern water 5 10 years 15 to 30 tu assigns some bomb tritium 30 tu assigns recharge generate in the 1960s 1970s referring to both classifications the tritium value table 2 designates that the groundwater in the hsb is modern or a mix of sub modern and modern water the tritium data present approaching as to the mean residence time of old versus new groundwater in the hsb the essential hypothesis for using groundwater age to set up vulnerability is that groundwater with a fairly rapid vertical transport rates have a younger age since most contaminants are exist near the earth s surface younger groundwater is therefore more vulnerable the results of tritium analysis exposed that groundwater in the ckfa tka and jka aquifers is younger than in both aia and cfa furthermore groundwater in the aia aquifer is younger than cfa as tritium value of aia is higher than in cfa fig 4 based on this classification groundwater vulnerability was assessed by comparing to the tritium 3h value and groundwater age this approach scrutinizes the comparison with a spatial pattern of variability of these maps along with a common cross section a b fig 6 to observe the linear relationship between vulnerability index value and groundwater tritium value the results show a better match between the patterns of the tritium value of groundwater and vulnerability index value achieved from vlda method compared to the cop model figs 7 and 8 therefore based on this verification it can be concluded that the vlda vulnerability model reflecting the real vulnerability situation in the hsb 5 conclusion two different models specifically cop and vlda have been applied to assess the possible groundwater vulnerability to pollution for the hsb the value of the vlda indices ranged from 2 133 9 16 and the value of the cop indices ranged between 0 79 6 2 the elevated index value of the vlda models refers to the higher class of vulnerability whilst the value of the lesser index value of the cop model refers to the higher rate of vulnerability cop model comprises very low to high while vlda model embraces low to very high vulnerability classes the remarkable disparity has been achieved from both applied models therefore the outcome desirable to be validated a ground water age was applied to assess the vulnerability of groundwater to contamination areas of recent recharge are vulnerable to contamination from surface recharges rainwater sample had a tritium value of 4 8 tu and a mean value of groundwater samples was 4 28 tu for ckfa tka and jka aquifers and 2 28 and 3 03 tu for cfa and aia aquifers respectively this approach examines the relationship between the spatial distribution of variability index value and groundwater age the results show a better match between the patterns of the tritium value of groundwater and the vulnerability index values achieved from vlada model rather than cop model because r2 value achieved from this relation by applying vlda model is about 0 75 while for cop model is about 0 45 the closer of the value of r squared on the graph to 1 0 confirm the better the fit of the regression line this validation confirmed that the vlda vulnerability model reflecting the real vulnerability situation in the hsb compared to the cop model

12116,there is a global attention that the future energy systems will be based on renewable energy like solar and wind the large scale utilization of renewables in space heating and cooling requires large thermal energy storage tes to overcome the varying supply and demand the process of producing the best underground thermal energy storage utes system pass through two steps first finding the best type of utes system second finding the best locations to install utes system both of these two steps depend extremely on the site specific parameters such that the depth to the groundwater transmissivity type of soil the depth to the bedrock and seepage velocity the purpose of this paper is to explain some of the site specific parameters that the type of utes system depends on and explain the suitable type of utes systems this study considers babylon province iraq as study area this province has electricity deficiency due to heating ventilating and air conditioning hvac applications the methodology of this study includes reviewing the literature that consider the study area and using arc map gis to visualize some of the in site parameters the results indicate that the best type of utes system for the considered region is either aquifer or pit type due to the type of the soil and the depth to the crystalline bedrock the hydraulic conductivity and the seepage velocity in the considered region are 0 0023 2 5 m d and 1 3 10 6 3 45 10 3 m d respectively these conditions satisfy the standards which regard aquifer type graphical abstract image 1 keywords renewable energy groundwater aquifer thermal energy storage pit thermal energy storage 1 introduction the oil crisis of 1977 was the major motivation for oil consuming countries to start searching for new energy sources as a result the use of renewable energy re increased unfortunately most renewable energy sources e g solar wind wave etc supply energy intermittently a complementary storage must therefore accompany the energy system so that excess energy can be stored from times of surplus production to times when demand exceeds supply rad and fung 2016 thermal energy storage tes systems are frequently used in both large and small scale renewable heating systems an effective tes system requires a material with suitable thermal properties i e high specific heat capacity and limited thermal resistance the storage material should also be cheap and abundantly available consequently the most eligible materials for that function are materials naturally found in the ground i e soil bedrock and groundwater commonly called underground thermal energy storage utes systems there are six types of underground thermal energy storage utes system they are aquifer bedrock pits tanks cavern and tubes in clay nordell 2000 schmidt and miedaner 2012b iraq is suffering from serious combined electricity deficiency and heating cooling problem electricity deficiency problem started by the first gulf war 1990 when the electricity power plants were bombed rashid et al 2012 the literatures indicate that the shortage in the production was about one half of 2008 demand iraq has a hot climate with temperatures reaching 50 c in some days in summer dropping towards 0 c during some nights in winter the temperature in the urban areas is further increased by the frequent use of air to air heat pumps air conditioners in buildings this problem becomes more complicated with the time due to the global warming and its consequences one of the most promising solutions is underground thermal energy storage utes to store winter cold and summer heat between the seasons the stored thermal energy can sometimes be extracted for direct use or by heat pumps to obtain a suitable supply temperature lindblom et al 2016 the process of finding the best underground thermal energy storage utes system consists of two steps first step is finding the best type of utes system that can be installed second step is finding the best location to install the utes system both of these two steps are extremely depend on in site specific parameters there are strong relations between the thermal chemical hydrological and mechanical properties of the materials in the underground thermal energy storage system pandey et al 2018 see fig 1 the best type of underground thermal energy storage utes system depends on three types of parameters they are site specific design and operation parameters see fig 2 some of design and operation parameters can be changed whilst the site specific parameters cannot be changed after selecting the location of the system therefore the site specific parameters are the predominant parameters in selecting the best type of underground thermal energy storage utes system using groundwater in iraq is very limited compared to the use of surface water due to the policies of the neighbouring countries regarding the surface water iraq must find solutions to the future potential problems regarding water al ansari 2013 al ansari et al 2014 one of the potential alternatives is using the groundwater there are many uses for the groundwater in addition to the main uses for drinking and agriculture one of these uses is for thermal energy storage tes systems the suitability and the potential use of the groundwater in iraq as aquifer thermal energy storage ates system was not discussed before this paper introduces the idea of utilizing the groundwater in iraq and babylon as aquifer thermal energy storage ates system to overcome the problems of electricity deficiency and using of the fossil fuel in spite of the fact that this technique is well known around the world but it is still not adopted in iraq due to the lack of the knowledge in this field in iraq and the dependence of the country on the available fossil fuel to use groundwater as ates system first a preliminary study should be implemented to have primary information about the aquifer and its suitability to be used as ates system the primary study should depend in the first place on site specific parameters hydrogeological geological and metrological parameters due to the fact that these parameters cannot be changed and the play a great role in deciding the suitability of each type of utes systems types many research had been executed in this context andersson 2007 bloemendal

tries to present all site specific parameters and conclude the best type of utes systems to be used according to these parameters it includes summarizing some of these parameters and using arcmap gis to depict some of geo hydrological parameters in addition this study includes two more methods to evaluate the suitability of the groundwater as a thermal storage they are aquifer vulnerability and groundwater seepage velocity this study considers babylon province iraq as a study area 2 methodology the methodology that was used in the paper consists of four main parts they are review of the literature interpolation to depict the geological and hydrological maps as gis maps evaluation of aquifer vulnerability by drastic index finding the seepage velocity for the groundwater a brief descriptions for each method is as follow 2 1 review the literature many papers were reviewed to address the statement of this paper the statement of the paper is that the in site parameters affect the efficiency and the types of the underground thermal energy storage utes systems some of the reviewed papers handled the reasons behind using utes systems utes systems types the components of each

written as 3 v s t n b δ h δ s where v s is the seepage velocity v is the darcy velocity n is the effective porosity k is the hydraulic conductivity δ h is the change of hydraulic head δ s is the distance t is the aquifer transmissivity and b is the aquifer saturated thickness arcmap gis software offers a tool that can be used to find the seepage velocity within a specific region this tool is darcy velocity within groundwater set spatial analysis tool box this tool requires inputting four raster maps to get the seepage velocity map these maps are groundwater elevation aquifer effective porosity aquifer saturated thickness and aquifer transmissivity al madhlom et al 2017 2 4 aquifer vulnerability drastic index vulnerability of the aquifer assesses the susceptibility of the aquifer to be polluted by the surface contaminants the contaminants are mobilized by the infiltrated water from the ground surface the assessment is based on assigning a rank ranges from 26 less vulnerable to 226 high vulnerable to the aquifer vulnerability of the aquifer is one of the important factors that should be considered in the evaluating the suitability of the aquifer for the thermal energy storage uses the reason behind this is the risk of the aquifer to be contaminated by non water heat transfer liquid the vulnerability of the aquifer is evaluated by using drastic index model according to this model the vulnerability of the aquifer is affected by seven geo hydrological parameters they are depth to groundwater net recharge aquifer media soil media region topography impact of vadose zone and hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer all the factors are collected in the acronym drastic aller et al 1987 drastic model simulates the vulnerability of the aquifer by using equation 4 the different potential effects of the seven geo hydrological parameters are introduced through the weight factors w while the local condition of the in site parameter is assigned through the rating parameters r aller et al 1987 4 v w r equation 4 can be written as follow 5 v w d r d w r r r w a r a w s r s w t r t w i r i w c r c where v is the vulnerability index w the weight factor r is the rating factor the subscript letters d r a s t i c refer to the seven geo hydrological parameters the values of the w values and r values are arranged in table 1 to apply equation 5 on spatial basis arcmap gis software is use this software has a tool raster calculator that can be used to establish the vulnerability map through applying equation 5 on the considered region al madhlom et al 2016 in the sections below there are 16 different figures herein in the table 2 is a brief description for each figure the table includes number of the figure title methodology to produce the figure 3 study area this paper considers babylon province as study area babylon province is located in the middle of iraq since it is impossible to study the local conditions inside babylon without relating to the geology of iraq this paper discusses in some sections the geology of iraq iraq is one of the middle east countries see fig 3 its land area is about 435000 km2 its population is about 38 million the climate is arid to semiarid the temperature is summer can exceed 50 c in afternoon and it drops below 0 c in some nights in winter iraq is suffering from a problem of deficiency in the electricity this problem is generated mainly from the huge using of air to heat pump in heating ventilation air conditioning hvac application rashid et al 2012 it is believed that this problem can be solved by using underground thermal energy storage utes system to improve the coefficient of performance cop of the heat pumps lindblom et al 2016 babylon province is located in the middle of iraq its area is about 5137 km2 its population is about 2 million capita 3 1 local conditions in iraq and babylon iraq s land area is divided into seven zones according to their morphology and hydrogeological conditions al jiburi and al basrawi 2015 these are thrust zone tz high folded zone hf low folded zone lf al jazira zone jz mesopotamia zone mz western desert zone wd and southern desert zone sd as shown in fig 3 to simplify the process of representation dots within the cells of table 3 see appendix 1 are used each of the seven hydro geological zones in the map is represented by nine dots in table 3 see appendix 1 these dots are distributed on nine locations within the table cells it is assumed that each dot represents a 1 9 fraction from the real region the location of the dot within the cell matches that 1 9 region fraction in real life more details can be found in fig 4 left considering fig 4l and r when the dots which belong to a specific region located in different categories means this region is located in different categories such that each distributed 1 9 fraction represents the corresponding real region part locates within that category fig 4l and r considering fig 4 right it explains that the north western 1 9 fraction of the region which titled tz thrust zone is located within the category a example the property the mean annual evaporation mm in table 3 for al jazira area jz see fig 3 the north eastern 1 9 fraction has an annual evaporation range 2000 mm 2500 mm while the south eastern 1 9 fraction for the same zone jz see fig 3 has an annual evaporation rang of 3000 mm 3500 mm whist the most of the region has an annual evaporation of 2500 mm 3000 mm see table 3 3 2 geology of iraq the geological features of the aquifers are very important to be considered in evaluating the suitability of the aquifer for thermal storage uses since they affect the thermal properties of the aquifers lee 2013 møller et al 2019 as stated in section 3 1 according

yacoub 2011a this region is mainly covered by the quaternary sediments these quaternary sediments were eroded by the fluvial system from the neighbouring zagros fold thrust belts and the arabian platform besides the quaternary sediments there are seven exposed formations belong to pre quaternary ages the exposed pre quaternary formations are distributed in two groups the first group is

it is bordered by euphrates river from the north and northeast iraqi jordanian and iraqi suadi arabian borders in the west and south and wadi al khir in the east sissakian and mohammed 2007 this region has a gentle slope of 5 m km toward the east and the northeast hamza 2007 sissakian and mohammed 2007 this region is covered by the sedimentary rocks of the types limestone dolomite limestone dolomite sandstone marl claystone and phosphorite with rare gypsum the oldest exposed rocks are formed in permian age while the youngest one are formed in the pliocene pleistocene age this region can be divided into three main different parts they are the eastern part the middle part and the western part sissakian and mohammed 2007 sissakian and mohammed 2007 mentioned 34 formations that they are exposed in this region they started by ga ara formation early late permian and ended by zahra formation pliocene pleistocene additionally quaternary deposits are well developed in this region they can be defined to the following main types habbariyah gravels pleistocene hauran gravels pleistocene terraces pleistocene calcrete pleistocene holocene gypcrete pleistocene holocene valley fill deposits holocene residual soil holocene and depression fill deposits holocene more details can be found in hamza 2007 and sissakian and mohammed 2007 the southern desert sd also called al badiya al jinoobiyah this region covers about 76000 km2 which represents about 16 81 from the total area of iraq fig 3 it is bounded by euphrates river from the north and northeast wadi al khir from the northwest the

parts of this region are located along the western side of euphrates river they have elevation range of 20 50 m a s l jassim and al jiburi 2009 ma ala 2009b most of exposed formations in this region are pre quaternary in age the oldest pre quaternary exposed formation is umm er radhuma paleocene age and the youngest pre quaternary exposed formation is zahra pliocene pleistocene age there are 5

jiburi 2009 all these formations are sedimentary rocks their lithological types for the three old formations are mainly limestone partly chalky dolomite for the later four formations the lithological types are mainly breccia claystone and sandstone jassim and al jiburi 2009 furthermore the southern desert has limited regions which are covered by the quaternary sediments there are 6 types of quaternary sediments that are developed in this region they are terracs pleistocene age gypcrete pleistocene alluvial fan sediments pleistocene valley fill sediments holocene depression fill sediments holocene wind blown sands holocene the lithological types of the quaternary sediments are mainly composite of gravel with sand and silt jassim and al jiburi 2009 more details can be found in jassim and al jiburi 2009 and ma ala 2009b the thrust zone tz was excluded from the explanation because of its small area about 1 32 from iraq fig 3 and complex geology and very low population babylon province is located in the middle of mesopotamia zone therefore all its geological features are the same features of the macro container system the other metrological geological geo hydrological data of iraq and babylon are summarized in table 3 appendix 1 the earth crust thickness in iraq ranges from 32 to 37 km aqrawi et al 2010 the fact that the depth of the crystalline precambrian formation varies between 8 and 12 km reveals that all the upper formations are sedimentary rocks covered by alluvium quaternary deposits sissakian 2013 3 3 aquifers within iraq there are 14 main aquifers in iraq table 3 and fig 5 these systems are explained in jassim and goff 2006 classification of aquifers considering porosity type and aquifer material and comparison between them regarding specific yield typical porosity values permeability ranges and hydraulic conductivity can be found in todd and mays 2005 in order to use the available groundwater effectively and sustainably quality and quantity there are some specific constrictions should be considered one of the most important constrains conditions is that the exploited groundwater should be within the aquifer resources limit groundwater resources safe yield can be defined as the amount of groundwater that can be pumped out without negative effects on the environment or the aquifer due to the discharged amount of groundwater can be easily replenished by the upcoming groundwater from adjacent aquifers rivers or catchments groundwater resources is measured by liter sec square kilometer l s km2 jassim and goff 2006 regarding the groundwater salinity gram liter g l aquifer resources are estimated groundwater by using resources modulus l s km2 the results are shown in fig 6 in figure 6a the total area km2 and modulus l s km2 for each aquifer is represented whilst figure 6b depicts aquifer resources l s according to different salinity and the total aquifer resource l s from figure 6b it can be concluded that most of the groundwater resources existing in mesopotamia plain aquifer no 10 has salinity more than 10 g l on the contrary the high folded zone groundwater resources aquifer no 14 which have salinity less than 1 g l jassim and goff 2006 there is another classification for iraqi aquifer mega systems set by alsam et al 1990 and jassim and goff 2006 according to the types of use the mega systems aquifer can be divided into domestic when its salinity less than 1 g l irrigation and livestock when its salinity ranges between 1 and 3 g l unusable when its salinity greater than 3 g l the results of each mega system aquifer are depicted in fig 7 fig 7 explains that all the groundwater resources within mesopotamia aquifer aquifer no 10 see figs 5 and 7 have no salinity less 5 g l jassim and goff 2006 rather than that most of the aquifer resources in this aquifer have salinity more than 10 g l jassim and goff 2006 with this rate of salinity mesopotamia aquifer is not appropriate for domestic and irrigation purposes on the other hand it could be appropriate for other purposes e g thermal energy storage many researchers wrote on the stratigraphy of iraq for example abawi and hammodi 2010 studied the stratigraphy of the dokan formation in the region of azmer jebel sulaimaniya northeast of iraq and its lithology another example aqrawi et al 2010 studied the general stratigraphy of iraq explaining the geological age names of the stratigraphy units lithological conditions and mega sequences jassim and al jiburi 2009 studied the stratigraphy of the southern desert of iraq explaining the exposed formations in this region lithology and thickness of each formation ma ala and al kubaysi 2009 studied the stratigraphy of al jazera area iraq they included their study information about the exposed formations lithology and thickness of the formations sissakian and al jibuori 2012 study the stratigraphy of the low folded zone iraq and the exposed formations their depths and lithology sissakian and al jiburi 2014 studied the stratigraphy of the high folded zone iraq explaining the formation their geological ages lithology and their thickness sissakian and mohammed 2007 studied the stratigraphy of the western desert in iraq explaining the stratigraphy of the exposed formation their lithology thickness and depositional environment some other researchers sissakian 2013 and yacoub 2011a b studied the stratigraphy of the mesopotamia plain which considered the macro region of the study area babylon governorate the general output of these studies is that the general constitution of the upper formations which could extent to 12 km in some location is sedimentary deposit due to mechanical processing compaction or chemical processing cementation or both of them the sedimentary deposits were transformed to sedimentary rock formations there is no overall study covering the groundwater temperature covering the whole area of iraq instead there are separate studies each one covered a specific small area from the country examples high folded zone sulaimani city north of iraq rasheed and aziz 2013 measured the groundwater temperature for 12 wells from april 2010 till august 2010 the results pointed out that the temperature within 19 6 c 24 4 c range hussien and gharbie 2010 measured the groundwater temperature for 24 springs in hit kubaisa region in al anbar governorate western desert region the temperature ranged from 22 c to 34 c another study by al dahan et al 2015 dealt with the groundwater temperature for 10 springs in the region of western desert close to mesopotamia plain within najaf province the results indicated that the temperature ranged between 23 c and 24 5 c with an average of 23 6 c as in fig 8 some examples are found in mesopotamia zone such as shale siltstone sandstone and conglomerate whilst some of mesopotamia karstified chemical sedimentary rocks are limestone marl gypsum and chert alluvial sediments unconsolidated deposits represent the upper cover of the sedimentary plain it mainly consists of flood plain sediments such as clay and silt alluvial fan sediments along the iraqi iranian border aeolian sand dunes in the central southern part of iraq and marsh sediments that consists from organic mud and silts by studying examining the three mesopotamia successive sw ne cross sections from the north to the south which were introduced by yacoub 2011a b it can be concluded that in general quaternary deposits thickness increases within the direction of south west direction and reaches about 180 m thick at basra extremist southern iraqi city sissakian 2013 yacoub 2011a b the thickest quaternary deposits unconsolidated is about 250 m north of basra jassim and goff 2006 4 results for babylon governorate the results for babylon province can be divided into four types according to the used methodology they are results from literature review results from interpolation results of seepage velocity and results of aquifer vulnerability 4 1 results from literature review the most the governorate land is covered by quaternary flood plain deposits mainly alluvial silty clayey loam soil which were eroded and transported by euphrates and tigris rivers except the southern eastern part which is covered by aeolian deposits fig 9 the northern west part of babylon is bordering to a spot covered by gypcrete and aeolian deposits whilst the exposed dibdibba formation is close to the western border of the governorate the section a b in figs 9 and 10 shows the geo hydrological circumstances of mesopotamia plain between iskandariya and salman pak part of the cross section located within babylon governorate the aquifers aquitards system can be represented by two aquitards upper belongs to quaternary geological era lower belong to pre quaternary geological era and one aquifer between them belongs to quaternary geological era from the aforementioned fig 10 it can be deduced that the upper aquitard thickness ranges from 7 to 20 m in some location whilst the lower aquitard thickness ranges from 6 m to 22 m and it could be absent in some locations in addition by examining fig 10 once more it can be concluded that the aquifer layer thickness changes from few meters till tens of meters about 60 m in some locations and it disappears in east when the upper and lower aquitards merge together the transmissivity see equation 2 changes from 14 7 m2 d in the western part of iskandariyah salman pak cross section to about 4 3 m2 d in the eastern part of the section due to the fine deposits that were carried by the rivers euphrates and tigris during quaternary era some interrupted semi aquifer and aquitard were built within the aquifer layer producing discontinuous in the thickness of the macro aquifer the thickness of the aquifer also changes in south east direction of mesopotamia from the boreholes data the maximum aquifer thickness which it is about 200 m was found near kut city south of iraq where the aquifer there does mainly consist from fine to medium grained sand cemented by gypsum in some times jassim and goff 2006 4 2 results from interpolation the groundwater depth below the ground surface is described by fig 11 the groundwater depth is very shallow almost the whole region has ground water depth within the range 1 81 m 3 60 m below the ground surface and it could be less than 1 81 m depth in some regions the deepest groundwater within the province is about 9 m in a small area in the southern part of babylon most of the area of the governorate has a hydraulic conductivity between 0 0022 m day and 2 50 m day fig 12 which is located within silt loess silty sand hydraulic conductivity ranges todd and mays 2005 the maximum value for the hydraulic conductivity in the studied area is 16 56 m day which is equivalent to the upper limit of silty sand hydraulic conductivity range todd and mays 2005 transmissivity map of the studied area is illustrated by fig 13 considering fig 13 the transmissivity of the study area increases from 52 m2 d in the eastern parts of the governorate to 137 m2 d in western parts of the governorate this matches with jassim and goff 2006 who stated that the transmissivity in babylon within the upper tens meters deposits is 100 200 m2 d and it decreases with the west direction toward suwaira city 60 km south baghdad 4 3 results of seepage velocity the seepage velocity within babylon ranges from 1 34 10 6 m day till 0 11 m day with most of the area has a seepage velocity within the range of 1 34 10 6 3 45 10 3 m d fig 14 low seepage velocity is produced due to two main reasons first low hydraulic conductivity fig 12 that the soil of the region has silt loess silty sand todd and mays 2005 second the low hydraulic gradient of the groundwater in this region fig 11 in addition the general groundwater flow direction from the north to the south of the governorate this coincides with the surface elevation and groundwater static elevation the approximate values for the magnitude and the direction of the groundwater flow are mentioned in the literature al jiburi and al basrawi 2011 2015 the results obtained from this work are very similar to the values from other researches 4 4 results of aquifer vulnerability the vulnerability of the aquifer in the northern part of babylon is explained by fig 15 al madhlom et al 2016 drastic index for the northern part of babylon shows that vulnerability of the aquifer ranges from 80 to 120 al madhlom et al 2016 this means that the aquifer has moderate vulnerability to the surface contaminants comparing these values with other work carried out in iraq the obtained values are considered reasonable abdullah et al 2018 b c 2019 5 conclusions since the crystalline basement is about 7 12 km deep in mesopotamia plain then igneous or metamorphic rock borehole thermal energy storage system cannot be used instead sedimentary rocks borehole thermal energy storage system can be used after regarding the geological geo hydrological thermal properties for the formation since mesopotamia groundwater has high salinity i e its inappropriately for domestic or agriculture proposes then it could be used for other purposes like thermal storage system the mesopotamia groundwater is very shallow normally less than 20 m depth and it reaches less than 2 m in some places of babylon governorate i e the expected aquifer storage system which will be implanted will be shallow compare to the aquifer system type in germany seibt and kabus 2006 the seepage velocity for babylon groundwater is very low since the groundwater flows in fine porous media alluvial silty clay soil within a range of 1 34 10 6 m day and 0 11 m day most of babylon area has a seepage velocity less than 3 45 10 3 m d that s means low advection losses in case of using aquifer thermal storage advection is the rate of bulk groundwater flow the thermal advection losses are the losses that are produced by advection fetter 2018 spread rate of the leached contaminants is proportional with seepage velocity fetter et al 2018 by comparing the resultant aquifer features with that stated by nordell et al 2015a b regarding thickness depth permeability groundwater flow and static head it can be concluded that the available aquifer satisfies the conditions it should be mentioned however that the region which has 0 0023 2 5 m d as hydraulic conductivity should be excluded from the proposed position for the future implemented system the losses from the surface and the surrounding of the system can be estimated by identifying the thermal properties and geo hydrological conditions of the surroundings to the storage system the expected useable thermal storage systems for the entire mesopotamian and babylon specifically are either pit in soil or aquifer thermal storage system since most of mesopotamia formations are sedimentary formation consolidated and unconsolidated then their thermal geological hydrogeological properties will be within the range of sedimentary deposits properties in addition to this study more studies can be accomplished in the future such as finding the best location to install ates system al madhlom et al 2019a b or considering the thermal properties of the ground where the system is planned to be installed e g thermal response test spitler and gehlin 2015 parameters like microbiology geochemistry and mineralogy of the ground must be covered by future studies since they effect directly the performance of the thermal storage system rad and fung 2016 there are many challenges that face this technique some challenges effect the efficiency of the system such as the short circuiting between the warm and cold wells akhmetov et al 2016 the thermal losses in the stored energy due to the interferences of the volumes of the warm energy and the cold energy thermal radii represent another challenge facing this technique gao et al 2017 degradation of the groundwater quality due to mixing groundwater of different temperatures and different qualities is one of the new problems that face aquifer thermal energy storage system possemiers et al 2014 the natural regional groundwater flow is also one of the most important problems that decreases the efficiency of the storage for the system due to thermal losses of the storage bloemendal and olsthoorn 2018 gao et al 2019 the negative effect of the heterogeneity in the hydraulic properties on the performance of the aquifer storage system represents a new challenge to this technique sommer et al 2013 additional challenges like geochemistry problems and clogging are stated in details by andersson 2007 nordell et al 2015a b and lee 2013 to overcome these challenges pilot systems and numerical simulations can be used dincer and rosen 2011 there are many limitations for the using of aquifer as thermal energy storage systems the limitations can be classified into three main types they are hydrogeological geological and metrological transmissivity saturated thickness specific yield porosity and hydraulic gradient are some of the hydrogeological limitations which were mentioned by paksoy et al 2000 another important limitation is that there should be a balance between the warm loads and the cold loads to avoid the change in the groundwater temperature dincer and rosen 2011 some of the major limitations which are stated in the literature are arranged in table 4 schmidt and miedaner 2012a b also added some additional limitations that should be considered they are stratigraphy grain size distribution porosity aquifer depth and geometry structures and fractures distribution storage efficiency leakage factors degree of consolidation thermal gradients static head and permission from the water authorities natural other limitations and their effects on the storage performance like clogging effects and thermal losses

12116,there is a global attention that the future energy systems will be based on renewable energy like solar and wind the large scale utilization of renewables in space heating and cooling requires large thermal energy storage tes to overcome the varying supply and demand the process of producing the best underground thermal energy storage utes system pass through two steps first finding the best type of utes system second finding the best locations to install utes system both of these two steps depend extremely on the site specific parameters such that the depth to the groundwater transmissivity type of soil the depth to the bedrock and seepage velocity the purpose of this paper is to explain some of the site specific parameters that the type of utes system depends on and explain the suitable type of utes systems this study considers babylon province iraq as study area this province has electricity deficiency due to heating ventilating and air conditioning hvac applications the methodology of this study includes reviewing the literature that consider the study area and using arc map gis to visualize some of the in site parameters the results indicate that the best type of utes system for the considered region is either aquifer or pit type due to the type of the soil and the depth to the crystalline bedrock the hydraulic conductivity and the seepage

new energy sources as a result the use of renewable energy re increased unfortunately most renewable energy sources e g solar wind wave etc supply energy intermittently a complementary storage must therefore accompany the energy system so that excess energy can be stored from times of surplus production to times when demand exceeds supply rad and fung 2016 thermal energy storage tes systems are frequently used in both large and small scale renewable heating systems an effective tes system requires a material with suitable thermal properties i e high specific heat capacity and limited thermal resistance the storage material should also be cheap and abundantly available consequently the most eligible materials for that function are materials naturally found in the ground i e soil bedrock and groundwater commonly called underground thermal energy storage utes systems there are six types of underground thermal energy storage utes system they are aquifer bedrock pits tanks cavern and tubes in clay nordell 2000 schmidt and miedaner 2012b iraq is suffering from serious combined electricity deficiency and heating cooling problem electricity deficiency problem started by the first gulf war 1990 when the electricity power plants were bombed rashid et al 2012 the literatures indicate that the shortage in the production was about one half of 2008 demand iraq has a hot climate with temperatures reaching 50 c in some days in summer dropping towards 0 c during some nights in winter the temperature in the urban areas is further increased by the frequent use of air to air heat pumps air conditioners in buildings this problem becomes more complicated with the time due to the global warming and its consequences one of the most promising solutions is underground thermal energy storage utes to store winter cold and summer heat between the seasons the stored thermal energy can sometimes be extracted for direct use or by heat pumps to obtain a suitable supply temperature lindblom et al 2016 the process of finding the best underground thermal energy storage utes system consists of two steps first step is finding the best type of utes system that can be installed second step is finding the best location to install the utes system both of these two steps are extremely depend on in site specific parameters there are strong relations between the thermal chemical hydrological and mechanical properties of the materials in the underground thermal energy storage system pandey et al 2018 see fig 1 the best type of underground thermal energy storage utes system depends on three types of parameters they are site specific design and operation parameters see fig 2 some of design and operation parameters can be changed whilst the site specific parameters cannot be changed after selecting the location of the system therefore the site specific parameters are the predominant parameters in selecting the best type of underground thermal energy storage utes system using groundwater in iraq is very limited compared to the use of surface water due to the policies of the neighbouring countries regarding the surface water iraq must find solutions to the future potential problems regarding water al ansari 2013 al ansari et al 2014 one of the potential alternatives is using the groundwater there are many uses for the groundwater in addition to the main uses for drinking and agriculture one of these uses is for thermal energy storage tes systems the suitability and the potential use of the groundwater in iraq as aquifer thermal energy storage ates system was not discussed before this paper introduces the idea of utilizing the groundwater in iraq and babylon as aquifer thermal energy storage ates system to overcome the problems of electricity deficiency and using of the fossil fuel in spite of the fact that this technique is well known around the world but it is still not adopted in iraq due to the lack of the knowledge in this field in iraq and the dependence of the country on the available fossil fuel to use groundwater as ates system first a preliminary study should be implemented to have primary information about the aquifer and its suitability to be used as ates system the primary study should depend in the first place on site specific parameters hydrogeological geological and metrological parameters due to the fact that these parameters cannot be changed and the play a great role in deciding the suitability of each type of utes systems types many research had been executed in this context andersson 2007 bloemendal and olsthoorn 2018 dincer and rosen 2011 gao et al 2019 lee 2013 møller et al 2019 nordell et al 2015a b possemiers et al 2014 rad and fung 2016 sommer et al 2013 spitler and gehlin 2015 this paper tries to present all site specific parameters and conclude the best type of utes systems to be used according to these parameters it includes summarizing some of these parameters and using arcmap gis to depict some of geo hydrological parameters in addition this study includes two more methods to evaluate the suitability of the groundwater as a thermal storage they are aquifer vulnerability and groundwater seepage velocity this study considers babylon province iraq as a study area 2 methodology the methodology that was used in the paper consists of four main parts they are review of the literature interpolation to depict the geological and hydrological maps as gis maps evaluation of aquifer vulnerability by drastic index finding the seepage velocity for the groundwater a brief descriptions for each method is as follow 2 1 review the literature many papers were reviewed to address the statement of this paper the statement of the paper is that the in site parameters affect the efficiency and the types of the underground thermal energy storage utes systems some of the reviewed papers handled the reasons behind using utes systems utes systems types the components of each type and its principle of work akhmetov et al 2016 andersson et al 2003 gao et al 2015 grein et al 2006 hesaraki et al 2015 jové manonelles 2014 nordell 2000 novo et al 2010 pinel et al 2011 rad and fung 2016 schmidt and miedaner 2012a b socaciu 2012 xu et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 zhao et al 2011 other papers are related to the suitable local in site conditions and how they affect the efficiency of the utes systems bloemendal et al 2014 bonte et al 2014 lee 2014 possemiers et al 2014 sommer et al 2013 spitler and gehlin 2015 zeghici et al 2015 other papers considered the field measurements of the installed systems and or the results from the software simulation models for these installed systems aragón aguilar et al 2017 bakr et al 2013 bridger and allen 2014 chung et al 1998 gehlin 2002

on the study area maps which are produced by interpolation tool are included this tool is available in arcmap gis software within spatial analyst tools the used tool is kriging because it the most accurate ones since it includes the behaviour of the investigated phenomenon in the estimation process arcgis 2014 2 3 seepage velocity the seepage velocity affects directly on the storage efficiency of the system though determining the advection thermal losses from the storage klepikova et al 2016 seepage velocity can be defined as the velocity of the water within the pores of the soil matrix fetter et al 2018 it can be calculated through dividing the darcy velocity by the porosity of the soil delleur 2007 as in equation 1 1 v s v n k n i k n δ h δ s since 2 t k b then equation 1 can be written as 3 v s t n b δ h δ s where v s is the seepage velocity v is the darcy velocity n is the effective porosity k is the hydraulic conductivity δ h is the change of hydraulic head δ s is the distance t is the aquifer transmissivity and b is the aquifer saturated thickness arcmap gis software offers a tool that can be used to find the seepage velocity within a specific region this tool is darcy velocity within groundwater set spatial analysis tool box this tool requires inputting four raster maps to get the seepage velocity map these maps are groundwater elevation aquifer effective porosity aquifer saturated thickness and aquifer transmissivity al madhlom et al 2017 2 4 aquifer vulnerability drastic index vulnerability of the aquifer assesses the susceptibility of the aquifer to be polluted by the surface contaminants the contaminants are mobilized by the infiltrated water from the ground surface the assessment is based on assigning a rank ranges from 26 less vulnerable to 226 high vulnerable to the aquifer vulnerability of the aquifer is one of the important factors that should be considered in the evaluating the suitability of the aquifer for the thermal energy storage uses the reason behind this is the risk of the aquifer to be contaminated by non water heat transfer liquid the vulnerability of the aquifer is evaluated by using drastic index model according to this model the vulnerability of the aquifer is affected by seven geo hydrological parameters they are depth to groundwater net recharge aquifer media soil media region topography impact of vadose zone and hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer all the factors are collected in the acronym drastic aller et al 1987 drastic model simulates the vulnerability of the aquifer by using equation 4 the different potential effects of the seven geo hydrological parameters are introduced through the weight factors w while the local condition of the in site parameter is assigned through the rating parameters r aller et al 1987 4 v w r equation 4 can be written as follow 5 v w d r d w r r r w a r a w s r s w t r t w i r i w c r c where v is the vulnerability index w the weight factor r is the rating factor the subscript letters d r a s t i c refer to the seven geo hydrological parameters the values of the w values and r values are arranged in table 1 to apply equation 5 on spatial basis arcmap gis software is use this software has a tool raster calculator that can be used to establish the vulnerability map through applying equation 5 on the considered region al madhlom et al 2016 in the sections below there are 16 different figures herein in the table 2 is a brief description for each figure the table includes number of the figure title methodology to produce the figure 3 study area this paper considers babylon province as study area babylon province is located in the middle of iraq since it is impossible to study the local conditions inside babylon without relating to the geology of iraq this paper discusses in some sections the geology of iraq iraq is one of the middle east countries see fig 3 its land area is about 435000 km2 its population is about 38 million the climate is arid to semiarid the temperature is summer can exceed 50 c in afternoon and it drops below 0 c in some nights in winter iraq is suffering from a problem of deficiency in the electricity this problem is generated mainly from the huge using of air to heat pump in heating ventilation air conditioning hvac application rashid et al 2012 it is believed that this problem can be solved by using underground thermal energy storage utes system to improve the coefficient of performance cop of the heat pumps lindblom et al 2016 babylon province is located in the middle of iraq its area is about 5137 km2 its population is about 2 million capita 3 1 local conditions in iraq and babylon iraq s land area is divided into seven zones according to their morphology and hydrogeological conditions al jiburi and al basrawi 2015 these are thrust zone tz high folded zone hf low folded zone lf al jazira zone jz mesopotamia zone mz western desert zone wd and southern desert zone sd as shown in fig 3 to simplify the process of representation dots within the cells of table 3 see appendix 1 are used each of the seven hydro geological zones in the map is represented by nine dots in table 3 see appendix 1 these dots are distributed on nine locations within the table cells it is assumed that each dot represents a 1 9 fraction from the real region the location of the dot within the cell matches that 1 9 region fraction in real life more details can be found in fig 4 left considering fig 4l and r when the dots which belong to a specific region located in different categories means this region is located in different categories such that each distributed 1 9 fraction represents the corresponding real region part locates within that category fig 4l and r considering fig 4 right it explains that the north western 1 9 fraction of the region which titled tz thrust zone is located within the category a example the property the mean annual evaporation mm in table 3 for al jazira area jz see fig 3 the north eastern 1 9 fraction has an annual evaporation range 2000 mm 2500 mm while the south eastern 1 9 fraction for the same zone jz see fig 3 has an annual evaporation rang of 3000 mm 3500 mm whist the most of the region has an annual evaporation of 2500 mm 3000 mm see table 3 3 2 geology of iraq the geological features of the aquifers are very important to be considered in evaluating the suitability of the aquifer for thermal storage uses since they affect the thermal properties of the aquifers lee 2013 møller et al 2019 as stated in section 3 1 according to the morphology of iraq can be divided into seven regions they are thrust zone tz high folded zone hf low folded zone lf al jazira zone jz mesopotamia zone mz western desert zone wd and southern

western and southern deserts from the west and southwest yacoub 2011a in spite of its flatness this zone has some undulations which are located at the northern borders the highest elevation of this zone is about 140 m a s l at fatha in the north the lowest point is about 1 m a s l in the extreme southeastern margin near the arabian gulf the region has gentle slope from the northwest toward southeast the region can be classified into three subzones according to its slope they are from the north to the south as follow 1 m 1 km slope region 1 m 3 km slope region and 1 m 20 km slope region yacoub 2011a this region is mainly covered by the quaternary sediments these quaternary sediments were eroded by the fluvial system from the neighbouring zagros fold thrust belts and the arabian platform besides the quaternary sediments there are seven exposed formations belong to pre quaternary ages the exposed pre quaternary formations are distributed in two groups the first group is located along the border with the western and southern deserts they are dammam late eocene euphrates and ghar early miocene nfayil middle miocene injana late miocene dibdibba pliocene early pleistocene the second group is located on the northern and eastern margin of the plain they are injana late miocene mukdadiya late miocene pliocene and bai hassan pliocene early pleistocene yacoub 2011b the quaternary sediments which are mainly silty clayey fluvial soil can be divided into four main stratigraphic units they are pliocene early pleistocene rock units pleistocene sediments rock units pleistocene holocene sequence and holocene sequence the holocene sequence covers most of the sedimentary plain its thickness is about 15 20 m and it is composed mainly of silty clay loamy sand and sandy loam soil yacoub 2011b more details can be found in yacoub 2011a and yacoub 2011b the western desert wd this region covers about 104000 km2 which represents about 27 22 from iraq area fig 3 it is bordered by euphrates river from the north and northeast iraqi jordanian and iraqi suadi arabian borders in the west and south and wadi al khir in the east sissakian and mohammed 2007 this region has a gentle slope of 5 m km toward the east and the northeast hamza 2007 sissakian and mohammed 2007 this region is covered by the sedimentary rocks of the types limestone dolomite limestone dolomite sandstone marl claystone and phosphorite with rare gypsum the oldest exposed rocks are formed in permian age while the youngest one are formed in the pliocene pleistocene age this region can be divided into three main different parts they are the eastern part the middle part and the western part sissakian and mohammed 2007 sissakian and mohammed 2007 mentioned 34 formations that they are exposed in this region they started by ga ara formation early late permian and ended by zahra formation pliocene pleistocene additionally quaternary deposits are well developed in this region they can be defined to the following main types habbariyah gravels pleistocene hauran gravels pleistocene terraces pleistocene calcrete pleistocene holocene gypcrete pleistocene holocene valley fill deposits holocene residual soil holocene and depression fill deposits holocene more details can be found in hamza 2007 and sissakian and mohammed 2007 the southern desert sd also called al badiya al jinoobiyah this region covers about 76000 km2 which represents about 16 81 from the total area of iraq fig 3 it is bounded by euphrates river from the north and northeast wadi al khir from the northwest the iraqi saudi arabian borders in the south and southwest and the iraqi kuwaiti borders in the southeast ma ala 2009b this region represents the extension of the northern part of the regional plateau of

parts of this region are located along the western side of euphrates river they have elevation range of 20 50 m a s l jassim and al jiburi 2009 ma ala 2009b most of exposed formations in this region are pre quaternary in age the oldest pre quaternary exposed formation is umm er radhuma paleocene age and the youngest pre quaternary exposed formation is zahra pliocene pleistocene age there are 5 formations between umm er radhuma and zahra formations they are dammam early late eocene euphrates early miocene ghar early miocene nfayil middle miocene dibdibba pliocene pleistocene jassim and al jiburi 2009 all these formations are sedimentary rocks their lithological types for the three old formations are mainly limestone partly chalky dolomite for the later four formations the lithological types are mainly breccia claystone and sandstone jassim and al jiburi 2009 furthermore the southern desert has limited regions which are covered by the quaternary sediments there are 6 types of quaternary sediments that are developed in this region they are terracs pleistocene age gypcrete pleistocene alluvial fan sediments pleistocene valley fill sediments holocene depression fill sediments holocene wind blown sands holocene the lithological types of the quaternary sediments are mainly composite of gravel with sand and silt jassim and al jiburi 2009 more details can be found in jassim and al jiburi 2009 and ma ala 2009b the thrust zone tz was excluded from the explanation because of its small area about 1 32 from iraq fig 3 and complex geology and very low population babylon province is located in the middle of mesopotamia zone therefore all its geological features are the same features of the macro container system the other metrological geological geo hydrological data of iraq and babylon are summarized in table 3 appendix 1 the earth crust thickness in iraq ranges from 32 to 37 km aqrawi et al 2010 the fact that the depth of the crystalline precambrian formation varies between 8 and 12 km reveals that all the upper formations are sedimentary rocks covered by alluvium quaternary deposits sissakian 2013 3 3 aquifers within iraq there are 14 main aquifers in iraq table 3 and fig 5 these systems are explained in jassim and goff 2006 classification of aquifers considering porosity type and aquifer material and comparison between them regarding specific yield typical porosity values permeability ranges and hydraulic conductivity can be found in todd and mays 2005 in order to use the available groundwater effectively and sustainably quality and quantity there are some specific constrictions should be considered one of the most important constrains conditions is that the exploited groundwater should be within the aquifer resources limit groundwater resources safe yield can be defined as the amount of groundwater that can be pumped out without negative effects on the environment or the aquifer due to the discharged amount of groundwater can be easily replenished by the upcoming groundwater from adjacent aquifers rivers or catchments groundwater resources is measured by liter sec square kilometer l s km2 jassim and goff 2006 regarding the groundwater salinity gram liter g l aquifer resources are estimated groundwater by using resources modulus l s km2 the results are shown in fig 6 in figure 6a the total area km2 and modulus l s km2 for each aquifer is represented whilst figure 6b depicts aquifer resources l s according to different salinity and the total aquifer resource l s from figure 6b it can be concluded that most of the groundwater resources existing in mesopotamia plain aquifer no 10 has salinity more than 10 g l on the contrary the high folded zone groundwater resources aquifer no 14 which have salinity less than 1 g l jassim and goff 2006 there is another classification for iraqi aquifer mega systems set by alsam et al 1990 and jassim and goff 2006 according to the types of use the mega systems aquifer can be divided into domestic when its salinity less than 1 g l irrigation and livestock when its salinity ranges between 1 and 3 g l unusable when its salinity greater than 3 g l the results of each mega system aquifer are depicted in fig 7 fig 7 explains that all the groundwater resources within mesopotamia aquifer aquifer no 10 see figs 5 and 7 have no salinity less 5 g l jassim and goff 2006 rather than that most of the aquifer resources in this aquifer have salinity more than 10 g l jassim and goff 2006 with this rate of salinity mesopotamia aquifer is not appropriate for domestic and irrigation purposes on the other hand it could be appropriate for other purposes e g thermal energy storage many researchers wrote on the stratigraphy of iraq for example abawi and hammodi 2010 studied the stratigraphy of the dokan formation in the region of azmer jebel sulaimaniya northeast of iraq and its lithology another example aqrawi et al 2010 studied the general stratigraphy of iraq explaining the geological age names of the stratigraphy units lithological conditions and mega sequences jassim and al jiburi 2009 studied the stratigraphy of the southern desert of iraq explaining the exposed formations in this region lithology and thickness of each formation ma ala and al kubaysi 2009 studied the stratigraphy of al jazera area iraq they included their study information about the exposed formations lithology and thickness of the formations sissakian and al jibuori 2012 study the stratigraphy of the low folded zone iraq and the exposed formations their depths and lithology sissakian and al jiburi 2014 studied the stratigraphy of the high folded zone iraq explaining the formation their geological ages lithology and their thickness sissakian and mohammed 2007 studied the stratigraphy of the western desert in iraq explaining the stratigraphy of the exposed formation their lithology thickness and depositional environment some other researchers sissakian 2013 and yacoub 2011a b studied the stratigraphy of the mesopotamia plain which considered the macro region of the study area babylon governorate the general output of these studies is that the general constitution of the upper formations which could extent to 12 km in some location is sedimentary deposit due to mechanical processing compaction or chemical processing cementation or both of them the sedimentary deposits were transformed to sedimentary rock formations there is no overall study covering the groundwater temperature covering the whole area of iraq instead there are separate studies each one covered a specific small area from the country examples high folded zone sulaimani city north of iraq rasheed and aziz 2013 measured the groundwater temperature for 12 wells from april 2010 till august 2010 the results pointed out that the temperature within 19 6 c 24 4 c range hussien and gharbie 2010 measured the groundwater temperature for 24 springs in hit kubaisa region in al anbar governorate western desert region the temperature ranged from 22 c to 34 c another study by al dahan et al 2015 dealt with the groundwater temperature for 10 springs in the region of western desert close to mesopotamia plain within najaf province the results indicated that the temperature ranged between 23 c and 24 5 c with an average of 23 6 c as in fig 8 some examples are found in mesopotamia zone such as shale siltstone sandstone and conglomerate whilst some of mesopotamia karstified chemical sedimentary rocks are limestone marl gypsum and chert alluvial sediments unconsolidated deposits represent the upper cover of the sedimentary plain it mainly consists of flood plain sediments such as clay and silt alluvial fan sediments along the iraqi iranian border aeolian sand dunes in the central southern part of iraq and marsh sediments that consists from organic mud and silts by studying examining the three mesopotamia successive sw ne cross sections from the north to the south which were introduced by yacoub 2011a b it can be concluded that in general quaternary deposits thickness increases within the direction of south west direction and reaches about 180 m thick at basra extremist southern iraqi city sissakian 2013 yacoub 2011a b the thickest quaternary deposits unconsolidated is about 250 m north of basra jassim and goff 2006 4 results for babylon governorate the results for babylon province can be divided into four types according to the used methodology they are results from literature review results from interpolation results of seepage velocity and results of aquifer vulnerability 4 1 results from literature review the most the governorate land is covered by quaternary flood plain deposits mainly alluvial silty clayey loam soil which were eroded and transported by euphrates and tigris rivers except the southern eastern part which is covered by aeolian deposits fig 9 the northern west part of babylon is bordering to a spot covered by gypcrete and aeolian deposits whilst the exposed dibdibba formation is close to the western border of the governorate the section a b in figs 9 and 10 shows the geo hydrological circumstances of mesopotamia plain between iskandariya and salman pak part of the cross section located within babylon governorate the aquifers aquitards system can be represented by two aquitards upper belongs to quaternary geological era lower belong to pre quaternary geological era and one aquifer between them belongs to quaternary geological era from the aforementioned fig 10 it can be deduced that the upper aquitard thickness ranges from 7 to 20 m in some location whilst the lower aquitard thickness ranges from 6 m to 22 m and it could be absent in some locations in addition by examining fig 10 once more it can be concluded that the aquifer layer thickness changes from few meters till tens of meters about 60 m in some locations and it disappears in east when the upper and lower aquitards merge together the transmissivity see equation 2 changes from 14 7 m2 d in the western part of iskandariyah salman pak cross section to about 4 3 m2 d in the eastern part of the section due to the fine deposits that were carried by the rivers euphrates and tigris during quaternary era some interrupted semi aquifer and aquitard were built within the aquifer layer producing discontinuous in the thickness of the macro aquifer the thickness of the aquifer also changes in south east direction of mesopotamia from the boreholes data the maximum aquifer thickness which it is about 200 m was found near kut city south of iraq where the aquifer there does mainly consist from fine to medium grained sand cemented by gypsum in some times jassim and goff 2006 4 2 results from interpolation the groundwater depth below the ground surface is described by fig 11 the groundwater depth is very shallow almost the whole region has ground water depth within the range 1 81 m 3 60 m below the ground surface and it could be less than 1 81 m depth in some regions the deepest groundwater within the province is about 9 m in a small area in the southern part of babylon most of the area of the governorate has a hydraulic conductivity between 0 0022 m day and 2 50 m day fig 12 which is located within silt loess silty sand hydraulic conductivity ranges todd and mays 2005 the maximum value for the hydraulic conductivity in the studied area is 16 56 m day which is equivalent to the upper limit of silty sand hydraulic conductivity range todd and mays 2005 transmissivity map of the studied area is illustrated by fig 13 considering fig 13 the transmissivity of the study area increases from 52 m2 d in the eastern parts of the governorate to 137 m2 d in western parts of the governorate this matches with jassim and goff 2006 who stated that the transmissivity in babylon within the upper tens meters deposits is 100 200 m2 d and it decreases with the west direction toward suwaira city 60 km south baghdad 4 3 results of seepage velocity the seepage velocity within babylon ranges from 1 34 10 6 m day till 0 11 m day with most of the area has a seepage velocity within the range of 1 34 10 6 3 45 10 3 m d fig 14 low seepage velocity is produced due to two main reasons first low hydraulic conductivity fig 12 that the soil of the region has silt loess silty sand todd and mays 2005 second the low hydraulic gradient of the groundwater in this region fig 11 in addition the general groundwater flow direction from the north to the south of the governorate this coincides with the surface elevation and groundwater static elevation the approximate values for the magnitude and the direction of the groundwater flow are mentioned in the literature al jiburi and al basrawi 2011 2015 the results obtained from this work are very similar to the values from other researches 4 4 results of aquifer vulnerability the vulnerability of the aquifer in the northern part of babylon is explained by fig 15 al madhlom et al 2016 drastic index for the northern part of babylon shows that vulnerability of the aquifer ranges from 80 to 120 al madhlom et al 2016 this means that the aquifer has moderate vulnerability to the surface contaminants comparing these values with other work carried out in iraq the obtained values are considered reasonable abdullah et al 2018 b c 2019 5 conclusions since the crystalline basement is about 7 12 km deep in mesopotamia plain then igneous or metamorphic rock borehole thermal energy storage system cannot be used instead sedimentary rocks borehole thermal energy storage system can be used after regarding the geological geo hydrological thermal properties for the formation since mesopotamia groundwater has high salinity i e its inappropriately for domestic or agriculture proposes then it could be used for other purposes like thermal storage system the mesopotamia groundwater is very shallow normally less than 20 m depth and it reaches less than 2 m in some places of babylon governorate i e the expected aquifer storage system which will be implanted will be shallow compare to the aquifer system type in germany seibt and kabus 2006 the seepage velocity for babylon groundwater is very low since the groundwater flows in fine porous media alluvial silty clay soil within a range of 1 34 10 6 m day and 0 11 m day most of babylon area has a seepage velocity less than 3 45 10 3 m d that s means low advection losses in case of using aquifer thermal storage advection is the rate of bulk groundwater flow the thermal advection losses are the losses that are produced by advection fetter 2018 spread rate of the leached contaminants is proportional with seepage velocity fetter et al 2018 by comparing the resultant aquifer features with that stated by nordell et al 2015a b regarding thickness depth permeability groundwater flow and static head it can be concluded that the available aquifer satisfies the conditions it should be mentioned however that the region which has 0 0023 2 5 m d as hydraulic conductivity should be excluded from the proposed position for the future implemented system the losses from the surface and the surrounding of the system can be estimated by identifying the thermal properties and geo hydrological conditions of the surroundings to the storage system the expected useable thermal storage systems for the entire mesopotamian and babylon specifically are either pit in soil or aquifer thermal storage system since most of mesopotamia formations are sedimentary formation consolidated and unconsolidated then their thermal geological hydrogeological properties will be within the range of sedimentary deposits properties in addition to this study more studies can be accomplished in the future such as finding the best location to install ates system al madhlom et al 2019a b or considering the thermal properties of the ground where the system is planned to be installed e g thermal response test spitler and gehlin 2015 parameters like microbiology geochemistry and mineralogy of the ground must be covered by future studies since they effect directly the performance of the thermal storage system rad and fung 2016 there are many challenges that face this technique some challenges effect the efficiency of the system such as the short circuiting between the warm and cold wells akhmetov et al 2016 the thermal losses in the stored energy due to the interferences of the volumes of the warm energy and the cold energy thermal radii represent another challenge facing this technique gao et al 2017 degradation of the groundwater quality due to mixing groundwater of different temperatures and different qualities is one of the new problems that face aquifer thermal energy storage system possemiers et al 2014 the natural regional groundwater flow is also one of the most important problems that decreases the efficiency of the storage for the system due to thermal losses of the storage bloemendal and olsthoorn 2018 gao et al 2019 the negative effect of the heterogeneity in the hydraulic properties on the performance of the aquifer storage system represents a new challenge to this technique sommer et al 2013 additional challenges like geochemistry problems and clogging are stated in details by andersson 2007 nordell et al 2015a b and lee 2013 to overcome these challenges pilot systems and numerical simulations can be used dincer and rosen 2011 there are many limitations for the using of aquifer as thermal energy storage systems the limitations can be classified into three main types they are hydrogeological geological and metrological transmissivity saturated thickness specific yield porosity and hydraulic gradient are some of the hydrogeological limitations which were mentioned by paksoy et al 2000 another important limitation is that there should be a balance between the warm loads and the cold loads to avoid the change in the groundwater temperature dincer and rosen 2011 some of the major limitations which are stated in the literature are arranged in table 4 schmidt and miedaner 2012a b also added some additional limitations that should be considered they are stratigraphy grain size distribution porosity aquifer depth and geometry structures and fractures distribution storage efficiency leakage factors degree of consolidation thermal gradients static head and permission from the water authorities natural other limitations and their effects on the storage performance like clogging effects and thermal losses are stated in details by andersson 2007 and bridger and allen 2005 and hesaraki et al 2015 acknowledgements this research is funded by university of babylon iraq through a scholarship to the first

12117,water shortage is one of the most critical problems all around the world especially in arid and semi arid regions using groundwater can be an efficient solution in such lands although significant care and appropriate water resource management strategies are required to be implemented nowadays subsurface dams ssd are widely used worldwide since they are proved to have advantages over surface dams in some cases selection of the suitable site for ssd construction is critical this selection is made based on advantages and disadvantages of each location multi criteria decision making methods mcdm is an efficient method for optimum site selection in this study 10 regions were chosen as alternatives for construction of subsurface dams in isfahan province of iran these alternatives were then ranked using electre i ii and modified electre iii based on geological hydrological climatological and socio economical criteria results from different electre methods are combined by applying the grade average and borda and copeland ranking strategies application of an advanced mcdm method reduced uncertainties in subsurface dams ssd site selection alternative 5 hoseinabad was introduced as the best location for subsurface dam construction this methodology can be used as a basis for more detailed field investigations graphical abstract image 1 keywords subsurface dams electre method groundwater resource hybrid mcdm borda count copeland method 1 introduction water shortage is a future global concern danilenko et al 2010 hence exploring new water resources or finding more effective ways to manage water is of high importance especially with the rapid development in industry and agriculture and population growth groundwater can be an effective solution although it requires thorough management strategies in arid and semiarid regions hydro drought regions with low amount of annual precipitation supplying water is a critical responsibility of local governments and water management is a serious need shahraki 2019 subsurface dams can provide inexpensive and effective methods for water resource management when they are constructed in suitable locations jamali et al 2013 subsurface dams not only have many advantages over surface dams but can also be constructed with local finance and resources in the past few years significant credit has been given to subsurface dams as a way to overcome water management issues although these structures were used in ancient times as well subsurface dams on the island of sardinia in roman times and similar structures by old civilizations in tunisia of north africa are some examples raju et al 2006 in recent years different techniques have been applied to build dams all around the world notably in southern and east africa and india hanson and nilsson 1986 also subsurface dams were used for prevention of saltwater intrusion all around the world chang et al 2019 choosing the best location to construct a subsurface dam is the great challenge and influenced by many factors including geology hydrogeology hydrology and economy these factors can either support or reject the site selection multi criteria decision making mcdm method is a practical solution in this regard since it can merge qualitative and quantitative criteria multi criteria decision making mcdm is based on defining a number of criteria giving them weights and finally ranking them to make a decision instead of solely optimal assessment criterion yasser et al 2013 the most important part of a decision making process is the criteria weighting researchers have developed several methods for accurate weights hyde et al 2005 there are various types of decision making methods that have been established in recent decades first some simple techniques such as compromise programming charnes and cooper 1957 simple additive weighting yoon and hwang 1995 and weighted sum methods janssen 1992 have been developed then traditional mcdm methods like analytic hierarchy process ahp saaty 1990 technique for order preference by simulation of ideal solution topsis yoon and hwang 1995 elimination et choice translating reality i ii iii benayoun et al 1966 have been used in industrial and management problems some advanced methods like preference ranking organization method for enrichment evaluations promethee brans et al 1986 gray relational analysis deng 1989 vikor method opricovic 1998 and data envelopment analysis cooper et al 2007 have been developed later mcdm analysis was used in different aspects of sustainable water management sheikhipour et al 2018 and specially in site selection of subsurface dams various studies have been conducted by using some methods like fahp tavakoli et al 2018 boolean and fuzzy logic jamali et al 2018 and ftopsis and edas kharazi et al 2019 but the critical challenge is that various mcdm methods make a different results and the integration of the results and finding a unique response for the problem is an acute necessity in this study the mcdm method was employed to optimize the project cost initially 10 out of 50 locations that had potential for subsurface dam were investigated in isfahan province of iran these locations were ranked using electre i ii and ii the results were then combined through ranking strategies like borda and copeland to suggest the best possible location for further detailed studies 2 subsurface dams subsurface dams ssd are constructed as a barrier for groundwater and can obstruct the natural flow and create storage for water in subsurface fig 1 an underground dam is recommended to manage water resources in regions where the construction of surface dams is difficult due to geological conditions and where groundwater cannot be used in its current state ishida et al 2011 constructing an underground dam allows the groundwater level to be raised up locally and it causes higher and easier access to groundwater resources this technology is used to block water movement at shallow depths therefore traditional water storages are utilized more efficiently and last longer the stored water is collected from a well that drilled in the upstream side of the dam frontières 2006 application of such structures to store groundwater has a long history subsurface dams were constructed in sardinia in roman times and similar structures were constructed by old civilizations in tunisia of north africa raju et al 2006 they have also been constructed in several parts of the world notably india africa brazil and etc ishida et al 2011 similar structures have been explored in the region of meymeh isfahan province of iran subsurface dams are mostly constructed in areas where groundwater flow fluctuates significantly during different seasons in the year so that in rainy seasons flow rate is high causing a higher groundwater level whereas in dry seasons both flow rate and groundwater level are low frontières 2006 there are two types of subsurface dams subsurface dams built below the ground level that capture the flow of a natural aquifer fig 2 and sand storage dams that impound water in sediments accumulated by the dam itself hanson and nilsson 1986 subsurface dams are recharged by rainwater or various underground streams which are seasonal in some cases in the case where the reservoir is fully saturated additional water overflows the dam ssds have many advantages over the surface dams for instance the land is not submerged to store water and the structural failure is not severe furthermore the surface area can be used equally before and after construction of the subsurface dam ishida et al 2011 subsurface dams are a method of overcoming many problems of surface dams such as risk of pollution siltation and losing water due to evaporation after regional site selection construction of subsurface dam need some more local engineering studies like geotechnical hydrogeological and hydro geophysical investigations dos santos gomes et al 2018 3 electre method many factors affect selecting a suitable location for constructing a subsurface dam the factors can be qualitative or quantitative and they can present advantages and disadvantages that support or reject the site selection multi criteria decision making methods make it possible to combine and give a better understanding of complex data electre method that is widely used in research is based on outranking approach roy 1968 the outranking relation is a term for the method in multi criteria decision making that indicates the decision maker s strongly established preferences roy 1968 the outranking relation applies various mathematical functions to show the dominance of one alternative over the others abedi et al 2012 electre method was developed by roy and hugonnard for ranking suburban rail line extension projects roy and hugonnard 1982 and for selecting the priority for renovating metro subway stations roy et al 1986 in paris a similar method applied in investment planning by giuliano 1985 it has also been used in hydrogeology and environmental fields in the last decades rogers and bruen 1995 in this method like other multi criterion models initial weights are assigned to decision criteria and then weights are varied as part of a sensitivity analysis comparison between alternatives proceeds on a pairwise basis concerning each decision criterion and builds the degree of dominance of one option over the others and result in ranking of the various options rogers and bruen 2000 there are currently several versions of electre and in the following sections electre i ii and the modified version of electre iii are presented 3 1 electre i electre i method consists of the following ten steps to change the r matrix to a final matrix that suggests the ranking of n criteria regarding m alternatives roy 1991 in this matrix the element associating alternative a 1 and criterion k is represented by g k a 1 a summary of the steps is presented below roy 1991 decision matrix is converted to a dimensionless matrix r where 1 r r 11 r 1 n r m 1 r m n there are several ways to create a dimensionless matrix however electre i method often uses eq 2 in this regard 2 r i j x i j i 1 m x i j 2 weight matrix w is defined as follows 3 w w 1 w 2 w n weighted normalized decision matrix is constructed afterward by multiplying the dimensionless decision matrix in the criteria weight vector alternatives are divided into preference and veto subsets the preference subset ske is a set of criteria in which alternative k is preferred to alternative e and the complementary set is the veto set i ke set of positive and negative criteria are respectively described accordingly next the preference and veto matrices are formed the preference matrix is a square matrix which its dimension shows the number of alternatives each element is an index of agreement between two alternatives in other words alternative k and alternative e must be compared index of concordance c k e can be calculated as below 4 c k e j s k e w j j 1 w j this value varies from 0 to 1 after defining the index of the agreement for all pairs of alternatives the preference matrix can be created as follows this matrix is normally not symmetrical 5 c c 12 c 1 m c 21 a 2 m c m 1 c m m 1 veto matrix is formed similarly using eq 6 it is a square matrix in which its dimension shows the number of alternatives each element is called an index of discordance between two alternatives the value of index of discordance can be determined using eq 6 and varies from 0 to 1 roy 1991 6 d k e m a x j i k e v k j v e j m a x j j v k j v e j preference threshold c can be calculated using eq 7 7 c k 1 k e m e 1 e k m c k e m m 1 if c k e c then k is preferred to e after the comparison dominance preference matrix f is formed as follows 8 f k e 1 c k e c 0 c k e c dominance veto matrix is created similarly after comparison veto threshold d is calculated as follows 9 d k 1 k e m e 1 e k m d k e m m 1 veto threshold ideally shows a small value dominance veto matrix g is defined as follows 10 g k e 0 d k e d 1 d k e d final dominance matrix h can be created by multiplying each element of dominance preference matrix f in each element of dominance veto matrix g as given below 11 h k e f k e g k e in this matrix if h k e 1 alternative k is preferred to alternative e in both preference and veto cases the number of times an alternative is preferred to the others defines the ranking 3 2 electre ii electre ii is the most similar to electre i among other electre methods two ranking equations are defined in electre ii instead of one in electre ii an alternative can be preferred to the others strongly or weakly alternative a is strongly preferred to alternative b when it fulfills the preference condition strongly and the veto condition weakly since steps 1 through 7 of electre ii method are the same as electre i only a summary of the next steps is explained four thresholds are defined to show the strong or weak preference where c and d show the strong preference and veto dominance and c and d show the weak preference and veto dominance respectively these four thresholds are usually defined by group decision making methods such as delphi method or through a questionnaire in case there are not enough experts available a decision maker with enough experience can define these thresholds two conditions of 0 c c 1 and 0 d d 1 must be always true to define a comparison matrix alternatives are compared in pairs taking the preference matrix c and the veto matrix d into account and for alternatives a and b if c a b c d a b d and c a b c b a then alternative a is strongly dominant and the element considering this pair of alternatives is shown with s f in the final dominant matrix if c a b c d a b d and c a b c b a then a is weakly dominant and the element considering this pair of alternatives is shown with s f in the final dominant matrix the elements that do not fulfill any of these conditions remain blank in the matrix values 2 and 1 are given to s f and s f respectively thus the number of times each alternative is dominant or subordinate can be determined alternatives are then ranked based on the values of s f s f from the greatest to the smallest 3 3 modified electre iii among all the available electre methods electre iii is the most accurate concerning its sensitivity to the preference thresholds and the ability to define different relations between the alternatives roy 1978 in this study electre iii method presented by roy 1978 and modified by li and wang li and wang 2007 was used steps are summarized as follows decision matrix is constructed as mentioned before in electre iii method three thresholds are introduced with the purpose of recognizing the optimum alternatives and engagement of experts ideas these thresholds are veto threshold q preference threshold p and indifference threshold τ for instance τ k p k and q k represent veto preference and indifference thresholds for criterion k respectively fig 3 the quantities of these thresholds are decided by individual or a team of experts as shown in fig 3 while comparing two alternatives a 1 and a 2 concerning criterion k comparing g k a 1 and g k a 2 five situations are possible if q k g k a 1 g k a 2 q k then a 1 and a 2 are nearly equal and it is shown by a 1 i k a 2 if q k g k a 1 g k a 2 p k then a 1 is preferred to a 2 and it is represented by a 1 q k a 2 if p k g k a 1 g k a 2 then a 2 is vetoed by a 1 completely and it is presented by a 1 p k a 2 if p k g k a 1 g k a 2 q k then a 2 is preferred to a 1 and it is illustrated by a 2 q k a 1 if q k g k a 1 g k a 2 p k then a 1 is vetoed by a 2 completely and it is shown by a 2 p k a 1 a preference matrix c k is formed using the matrix created and thresholds each element of this matrix is calculated using the following equation 12 c k a 1 a 2 g k a 1 p k a 2 g k a 2 p k a 1 q k a 2 i f q k a 2 g k a 2 g k a 1 p k a 2 1 i f g k a 2 g k a 1 q k a 2 0 i f p k a 2 g k a 2 g k a 1 a total preference matrix c is formed using a method called weight averaging process w k presents the weight of criterion k 13 c a 1 a 2 k 1 n w k c k a 1 a 2 k 1 n w k a veto matrix d k is constructed using the matrix thresholds introduced earlier each element of the veto matrix is calculated using eq 14 14 d k a 1 a 2 g k a 1 p k a 2 g k a 2 τ k a 2 p k a 2 i f p k a 1 g k a 2 g k a 1 τ k a 2 1 i f τ k a 2 g k a 2 g k a 1 0 i f g k a 2 g k a 1 p k a 2 a total veto matrix d is formed afterward w k is referred to the weight of criterion k 15 d a 1 a 2 k 1 n w k d k a 1 a 2 k 1 n w k credibility matrix s is created using the total preference and veto matrices the elements of credibility matrix can be calculated using the following equation 16 s a 1 a 2 c a 1 a 2 i f d k a 1 a 2 c a 1 a 2 k c a 1 a 2 k i d k a 1 a 2 1 d k a 1 a 2 1 c a 1 a 2 o t h e r w i s e the discordance credibility degree is defined by φ and the concordance credibility degree is defined by φ which is the measure of the outranking character of xi xi dominates all the other alternatives of x the net credibility degree can be described by φ that is a value function where a higher value reveals a higher attractiveness of alternative xi li and wang 2007 φ φ and φ can be expressed as follows 17 φ x i x j x s x i x j x i x φ x i x j x s x j x i x i x φ x i φ x i φ x i x i x the alternatives are ranked according to their qualification from the best to the worst by the net credibility degree 4 study area annual water consumption in iran is about 93 4 billion cubic meters that include surface water and groundwater 93 of which is used for agriculture and less than 7 is allocated for domestic and industrial use zehtabian et al 2010 the average agricultural demand in the region is 1280 million cubic meters each year moghaddasi et al 2013 in iran groundwater is the principal source of water for irrigation and domestic and industrial use due to the increasing demand for potable and irrigation water and inadequacy of available surface water the importance of groundwater is increasing exponentially nagarajan et al 2010 about 55 of the water consumed in iran comes from groundwater and the rest is obtained from surface water from 1988 to 2006 consumption of groundwater compared to surface water increased significantly since agriculture depends on groundwater directly groundwater management is of high importance khosravi 2005 isfahan province is situated in the centre of iran this province covers an area of approximately 107 027 square kilometers according to the general census in 2011 the population of the province was 4 815 863 of which approximately 83 3 were urban residents and the remaining 16 7 resided in rural areas fig 4 shows the location map of the study area the climate in isfahan varies in different parts and is hot and dry in northern and eastern regions of the province but is semi humid in western areas and in south it is cold and semi arid in isfahan province the annual precipitation and temperature are 120 mm and 16 7 c respectively the minimum temperature during winter is 10 6 c and the maximum in the summer is 40 6 c geologically majority of the province is covered by sedimentary rocks like limestone dolomite evaporates sandstone and shale except along with zayandehrud river basin which is alluvium the soils in the study area include immature calcaric regosols lithic teptosols and haplic calcisols with undeveloped horizons keshavarzi et al 2015 in recent terraces alluvial deposit and undifferentiated terraces with an age of quaternary have been underlined in the southwest and south of the region the geology is lower cretaceous gray limestone containing orbitalin and jurassic shale comprising ammonite aridisoils belonging to different great groups such as calciargids haplocambids haplogypsids and haplosalids are the main soils in these parts of the province geological and hydrogeological properties of the different alternatives have been characterized for example fig 5 shows geological map of the study area and fig 6 illustrates the fault map in fig 7 drainage map of the study area with two clay and salt flat parts of isfahan province is shown 5 methodology the agriculture research centre of isfahan selected 10 locations out of 50 after a primary investigation for construction of a subsurface dam in the study area these 10 locations were ranked according to 14 criteria shown in fig 8 for criteria definition four main categories were defined including climate geology socioeconomic and hydrology in each main category sub criteria were defined as measurable items in the study area in large scale and more detailed criteria were left for next stages of details study for example water level or hydrodynamic parameters 5 1 relative weights a most crucial step in ssd site selection is criteria weighting in current research after defining the final criteria 10 experts were invited to give their opinions on the weight of each criterion through a questionnaire based on saaty scale 1 9 in this method the number 1 was given to the least and 9 to the most important criterion sub surface dam site selection criteria weights using mcdm method and the total collected results are given in table 1 as it is shown in this table the geometric mean method was used for averaging different expert s opinion and providing a unique value for each criterion the geometric mean of each row was used as the final weight of criteria and the pairwise comparison matrix was built different methods of calculating relative weight such as least squares least logarithmic squares eigenvector and approximation methods were implemented in this study approximation methods were used to define the relative weights approximation methods include row sum method the column sum method arithmetic average method and the geometric mean method weight vectors of the above methods were compared to those resulted by fuzzy delphi ahp chang 1996 and fuzzy ahp liu and chen 2007 methods and the final weights were then compared in fig 9 the inconsistency ratio is calculated to be equal to zero the suggested questionnaires by saaty 1990 was used to predict these values 6 application of combined electre method for ssd site selection with respect to 14 criteria and 10 alternatives that defined in this study the decision matrix of ssd site selection table 2 was prepared for each alternative the value of each criterion was calculated or collected since the study area is large and ssd construction is a new methodology in iran the experts in agricultural research centre arc of isfahan that completely know the area and also some academic experts from university fill the questionnaires and helped for the construction of the decision matrix some of the information like area of the upper basin distance from the faults and average annual rainfall was collected from the relevant maps and data sources in isfahan province finally the matrix was formed in both qualitative and quantitative formats table 2 qualitative parameters are then converted to quantitative ones based on the weights suggested by experts as given in table 3 this matrix is the final matrix that was used in the elctre process in next steps in this study alternatives a 1 a 2 a 3 a 10 are ranked according to criteria c 1 c 2 c 3 c 14 criteria c 1 c 4 and c 14 present a negative aspect and if they present a lower value for an alternative the chance of selecting that alternative is higher 6 1 application of electre i decision matrix is converted to the final dominance matrix as explained earlier in the methodology section number of times that each alternative is dominant or subordinate and the difference between them was determined the ranking and it shows in table 4 6 2 application of electre ii as mentioned in the methodology section strong and weak preference and veto thresholds are defined in electre ii preference and veto thresholds for strong dominance were 0 8 and 1 and preference and veto thresholds for weak dominance were defined 0 5 and 0 5 respectively final comparison dominance matrix is formed according to these thresholds as mentioned earlier for a better ranking result values 2 and 1 are given to s f and s f respectively the number of times that each of the alternatives are dominant or subordinate and the differences are necessary to determine the ranking and it shows in table 5 6 3 application of modified electre iii after creating the decision matrix the most important step is to specify the thresholds the thresholds are defined based on the experts suggestions preference matrixes c k for each criterion is created and the preference matrix for criterion 1 c 1 is created according to eq 8 preference matrices for criteria 2 14 are constructed using the same equation the total preference matrix c is created applying eq 13 in addition veto matrices d k for each criterion is created according to eq 14 the total veto matrix d is constructed according to eq 14 the credibility matrix s is created afterward according to eq 16 in the next step φ φ and φ are calculated based on eq 17 and the quantities are given in table 6 the final ranking is conducted by arranging the net credibility degrees φ from the largest quantity to the smallest 7 results and discussion in a multi criteria decision making problem various methods may be used and their results are not always the same therefore the optimum selection is not always clear in these situations different merging methods such as the grade average method borda method and copeland method hwang and yoon 1981 borda 1784 copeland 1951 are useful for combining the results and presenting a unique response for the problem different mcdm methods have been conducted for site selection of subsurface dams for example the ahp and fahp methods tavakoli et al 2018 boolean and fuzzy logic jamali et al 2018 and also ftopsis and edas kharazi et al 2019 have been used in previous studies in current research not only the electre method as an advanced method of mcdm has been used but also the application of integration strategies for coupling the results of different methods have been examined borda and copeland methods used in current study reduced the uncertainty in different results and present a unique response for selecting the appropriate location for ssd construction in this study the ranking results of electre i ii iii are shown in fig 10 and in next section ranking strategies will be applied 7 1 ranking strategies and hybrid electre 7 1 1 the grade average method in this method the arithmetic average of rankings using different methods are calculated for each alternative and final ranking is presented the alternative with the smaller arithmetic average is considered a better alternative in table 7 different rankings were merged by using the grade average final ranking with this method is shown in fig 11 also table 7 was used in creating the pairwise comparison matrix for the other ranking strategies 7 1 2 borda method in this method was introduced by borda 1784 and have been used widely in economic and social science borda 1784 in the borda method a pairwise comparison matrix is formed for choosing the best alternative in comparing two alternatives based on table 7 if the order that an alternative is dominated is greater than the order it is subordinated then it is given by 1 otherwise the value of 0 assigned to the related matrix elements after constructing the pairwise comparison matrix the row sum for each row shows the number of times that an alternative is preferred to the others and the alternatives are ranked based on this value table 8 7 1 3 copeland method copeland method is the modified version of the borda count the number of times that an alternative is subordinated or dominant is used to rank the alternatives like the borda method copeland 1951 lamboray 2007 after that the row sum and column sum for each alternative have been determined the final copeland number obtained from the difference of row sum and column sum for each alternative table 8 figs 12 and 13 show the application of borda and copeland methods for determining the final ranking of ssd alternatives in fig 14 results from the grade average borda count and copeland methods are compared with each other 8 conclusion subsurface dam site selection is conducted based on various criteria due to hydrogeological complexities this diversity of criteria and lack of information in the preliminary stages of the investigation lead to a complex and difficult decision making process especially if the prospecting area is regional locating the optimum location for subsurface dam construction will be difficult multi criteria decision making can be an effective approach to solving such complex problems since there are many methods of decision making using different methods can lead to different results and increase uncertainty three electre methods were combined using ranking strategies to form a hybrid method and suggest one location for further studies another issue in locating the subsurface dams is depending on the area under investigation and the geological geomorphological and hydrogeological conditions of the area there are numerous criteria for choosing the most suitable location in this study four categories of climatic geological hydrological and socio economic factors were used 14 sub criteria were chosen as main factors in this case study as the study area is large and there were limitations for detailed hydrogeological data this hybrid method enables researchers to suggest an optimum area using limited criteria it is recommended that further studies focus on the top alternatives and include more site based data to ensure the optimum area is selected for the subsurface dam construction the results show that the fuzzy method is not suitable for criteria weighting modified electre iii shows that alternative a5 hoseinabad was identified as the optimal site for the subsurface dam this alternative was also approved by those experts involved in this research and further field investigations criteria and method used in this study can be used as a preliminary planning step for subsurface dam construction and for more detailed field

12117,water shortage is one of the most critical problems all around the world especially in arid and semi arid regions using groundwater can be an efficient solution in such lands although significant care and appropriate water resource management strategies are required to be implemented nowadays subsurface dams ssd are widely used worldwide since they are proved to have advantages over surface dams in some cases selection of the suitable site for ssd construction is critical this selection is made based on advantages and disadvantages of each location multi criteria decision making methods mcdm is an efficient method for optimum site selection in this study 10 regions were chosen as alternatives for construction of subsurface dams in isfahan province of iran these alternatives were then ranked using electre i ii and modified electre iii based on geological hydrological climatological and socio economical criteria results from different electre methods are combined by applying the grade average and borda and copeland ranking strategies application of an advanced mcdm method reduced uncertainties in subsurface dams ssd site selection alternative 5 hoseinabad was introduced as the best location for subsurface dam construction this methodology can be used as a basis for more detailed field investigations graphical abstract image 1 keywords subsurface dams electre method groundwater resource hybrid mcdm borda count copeland method 1 introduction water shortage is a future global concern danilenko et al 2010 hence exploring new water resources or finding more effective ways to manage water is of high importance especially with the rapid development in industry and agriculture and population growth groundwater can be an effective solution although it requires thorough management strategies in arid and semiarid regions hydro drought regions with low amount of annual precipitation supplying water is a critical responsibility of local governments and water management is a serious need shahraki 2019 subsurface dams can provide inexpensive and effective methods for water resource management when they are constructed in suitable locations jamali et al 2013 subsurface dams not only have many advantages over surface dams but can also be constructed with local finance and resources in the past few years significant credit has been given to subsurface dams as a way to overcome water management issues although these structures were used in ancient times as well subsurface dams on the island of sardinia in roman times and similar structures by old civilizations in tunisia of north africa are some examples raju et al 2006 in recent years different techniques have been applied to build dams all around the world notably in southern and east africa and india hanson and nilsson 1986 also subsurface dams were used for prevention of saltwater intrusion all around the world chang et al 2019 choosing the best location to construct a subsurface dam is the great challenge and influenced by many factors including geology hydrogeology hydrology and economy these factors can either support or reject the site selection multi criteria decision making mcdm method is a practical solution in this regard since it can merge qualitative and quantitative criteria multi criteria decision making mcdm is based on defining a number of criteria giving them weights and finally ranking them to make a decision instead of solely optimal assessment criterion yasser et al 2013 the most important part of a decision making process is the criteria weighting researchers have developed several methods for accurate weights hyde et al 2005 there are various types of decision making methods that have been established in recent decades first some simple techniques such as compromise programming charnes and cooper 1957 simple additive weighting yoon and hwang 1995 and weighted sum methods janssen 1992 have been developed then traditional mcdm methods like analytic hierarchy process ahp saaty 1990 technique for order preference by simulation of ideal solution topsis yoon and hwang 1995 elimination et choice translating reality i ii iii benayoun et al 1966 have been used in industrial and management problems some advanced methods like preference ranking organization method for enrichment evaluations promethee brans et al 1986 gray relational analysis deng 1989 vikor method opricovic 1998 and data envelopment analysis cooper et al 2007 have been developed later mcdm analysis was used in different aspects of sustainable water management sheikhipour et al 2018 and specially in site selection of subsurface dams various studies have been conducted by using some methods like fahp tavakoli et al 2018 boolean and fuzzy logic jamali et al 2018 and ftopsis and edas kharazi et al 2019 but the critical challenge is that various mcdm methods make a different results and the integration of the results and finding a unique response for the problem is an acute necessity in this study the mcdm method was employed to optimize the project cost initially 10 out of 50 locations that had potential for subsurface dam were investigated in isfahan province of iran these locations were ranked using electre i ii and ii the results were then combined through ranking strategies like borda and copeland to suggest the best possible location for further detailed studies 2 subsurface dams subsurface dams ssd are constructed as a barrier for groundwater and can obstruct the natural flow and create storage for water in subsurface fig 1 an underground dam is recommended to manage water resources in regions where the construction of surface dams is difficult due to geological conditions and where groundwater cannot be used in its current state ishida et al 2011 constructing an underground dam allows the groundwater level to be raised up locally and it causes higher and easier access to groundwater resources this technology is used to block water movement at shallow depths therefore traditional water storages are utilized more efficiently and last longer the stored water is collected from a well that drilled in the upstream side of the dam frontières 2006 application of such structures to store groundwater has a long history subsurface dams were constructed in sardinia in roman times and similar structures were constructed by old civilizations in tunisia of north africa raju et al 2006 they have also been constructed in several parts of the world notably india africa brazil and etc ishida et al 2011 similar structures have been explored in the region of meymeh isfahan province of iran subsurface dams are mostly constructed in areas where groundwater flow fluctuates significantly during different seasons in the year so that in rainy seasons flow rate is high causing a higher groundwater level whereas in dry seasons both flow rate and groundwater level are low frontières 2006 there are two types of subsurface dams subsurface dams built below the ground level that capture the flow of a natural aquifer fig 2 and sand storage dams that impound water in sediments accumulated by the dam itself hanson and nilsson 1986 subsurface dams are recharged by rainwater or various underground streams which are seasonal in some cases in the case where the reservoir is fully saturated additional water overflows the dam ssds have many advantages over the surface dams for instance the land is not submerged to store water and the structural failure is not severe furthermore the surface area can be used equally before and after construction of the subsurface dam ishida et al 2011 subsurface dams are a method of overcoming many problems of surface dams such as risk of pollution siltation and losing water due to evaporation after regional site selection construction of subsurface dam need some more local engineering studies like geotechnical hydrogeological and hydro geophysical investigations dos santos gomes et al 2018 3 electre method many factors affect selecting a suitable location for constructing a subsurface dam the factors can be qualitative or quantitative and they can present advantages and disadvantages that support or reject the site selection multi criteria decision making methods make it possible to combine and give a better understanding of complex data electre method that is widely used in research is based on outranking approach roy 1968 the outranking relation is a term for the method in multi criteria decision making that indicates the decision maker s strongly established preferences roy 1968 the outranking relation applies various mathematical functions to show the dominance of one alternative over the others abedi et al 2012 electre method was developed by roy and hugonnard for ranking suburban rail line extension projects roy and hugonnard 1982 and for selecting the priority for renovating metro subway stations roy et al 1986 in paris a similar method applied in investment planning by giuliano 1985 it has also been used in hydrogeology and environmental fields in the last decades rogers and bruen 1995 in this method like other multi criterion models initial weights are assigned to decision criteria and then weights are varied as part of a sensitivity analysis comparison between alternatives proceeds on a pairwise basis concerning each decision criterion and builds the degree of dominance of one option over the others and result in ranking of the various options rogers and bruen 2000 there are currently several versions of electre and in the following sections electre i ii and the modified version of electre iii are presented 3 1 electre i electre i method consists of the following ten steps to change the r matrix to a final matrix that suggests the ranking of n criteria regarding m alternatives roy 1991 in this matrix the element associating alternative a 1 and criterion k is represented by g k a 1 a summary of the steps is presented below roy 1991 decision matrix is converted to a dimensionless matrix r where 1 r r 11 r 1 n r m 1 r m n there are several ways to create a dimensionless matrix however electre i method often uses eq 2 in this regard 2 r i j x i j i 1 m x i j 2 weight matrix w is defined as follows 3 w w 1 w 2 w n weighted normalized decision matrix is constructed afterward by multiplying the dimensionless decision matrix in the criteria weight vector alternatives are divided into preference and veto subsets the preference subset ske is a set of criteria in which alternative k is preferred to alternative e and the complementary set is the veto set i ke set of positive and negative criteria are respectively described accordingly next the preference and veto matrices are formed the preference matrix is a square matrix which its dimension shows the number of alternatives each element is an index of agreement between two alternatives in other words alternative k and alternative e must be compared index of concordance c k e can be calculated as below 4 c k e j s k e w j j 1 w j this value varies from 0 to 1 after defining the index of the agreement for all pairs of alternatives the preference matrix can be created as follows this matrix is normally not symmetrical 5 c c 12 c 1 m c 21 a 2 m c m 1 c m m 1 veto matrix is formed similarly using eq 6 it is a square matrix in which its dimension shows the number of alternatives each element is called an index of discordance between two alternatives the value of index of discordance can be determined using eq 6 and varies from 0 to 1 roy 1991 6 d k e m a x j i k e v k j v e j m a x j j v k j v e j preference threshold c can be calculated using eq 7 7 c k 1 k e m e 1 e k m c k e m m 1 if c k e c then k is preferred to e after the comparison dominance preference matrix f is formed as follows 8 f k e 1 c k e c 0 c k e c dominance veto matrix is created similarly after comparison veto threshold d is calculated as follows 9 d k 1 k e m e 1 e k m d k e m m 1 veto threshold ideally shows a small value dominance veto matrix g is defined as follows 10 g k e 0 d k e d 1 d k e d final dominance matrix h can be created by multiplying each element of dominance preference matrix f in each element of dominance veto matrix g as given below 11 h k e f k e g k e in this matrix if h k e 1 alternative k is preferred to alternative e in both preference and veto cases the number of times an alternative is preferred to the others defines the ranking 3 2 electre ii electre ii is the most similar to electre i among other electre methods two ranking equations are defined in electre ii instead of one in electre ii an alternative can be preferred to the others strongly or weakly alternative a is strongly preferred to alternative b when it fulfills the preference condition strongly and the veto condition weakly since steps 1 through 7 of electre ii method are the same as electre i only a summary of the next steps is explained four thresholds are defined to show the strong or weak preference where c and d show the strong preference and veto dominance and c and d show the weak preference and veto dominance respectively these four thresholds are usually defined by group decision making methods such as delphi method or through a questionnaire in case there are not enough experts available a decision maker with enough experience can define these thresholds two conditions of 0 c c 1 and 0 d d 1 must be always true to define a comparison matrix alternatives are compared in pairs taking the preference matrix c and the veto matrix d into account and for alternatives a and b if c a b c d a b d and c a b c b a then alternative a is strongly dominant and the element considering this pair of alternatives is shown with s f in the final dominant matrix if c a b c d a b d and c a b c b a then a is weakly dominant and the element considering this pair of alternatives is shown with s f in the final dominant matrix the elements that do not fulfill any of these conditions remain blank in the matrix values 2 and 1 are given to s f and s f respectively thus the number of times each alternative is dominant or subordinate can be determined alternatives are then ranked based on the values of s f s f from the greatest to the smallest 3 3 modified electre iii among all the available electre methods electre iii is the most accurate concerning its sensitivity to the preference thresholds and the ability to define different relations between the alternatives roy 1978 in this study electre iii method presented by roy 1978 and modified by li and wang li and wang 2007 was used steps are summarized as follows decision matrix is constructed as mentioned before in electre iii method three thresholds are introduced with the purpose of recognizing the optimum alternatives and engagement of experts ideas these thresholds are veto threshold q preference threshold p and indifference threshold τ for instance τ k p k and q k represent veto preference and indifference thresholds for criterion k respectively fig 3 the quantities of these thresholds are decided by individual or a team of experts as shown in fig 3 while comparing two alternatives a 1 and a 2 concerning criterion k comparing g k a 1 and g k a 2 five situations are possible if q k g k a 1 g k a 2 q k then a 1 and a 2 are nearly equal and it is shown by a 1 i k a 2 if q k g k a 1 g k a 2 p k then a 1 is preferred to a 2 and it is represented by a 1 q k a 2 if p k g k a 1 g k a 2 then a 2 is vetoed by a 1 completely and it is presented by a 1 p k a 2 if p k g k a 1 g k a 2 q k then a 2 is preferred to a 1 and it is illustrated by a 2 q k a 1 if q k g k a 1 g k a 2 p k then a 1 is vetoed by a 2 completely and it is shown by a 2 p k a 1 a preference matrix c k is formed using the matrix created and thresholds each element of this matrix is calculated using the following equation 12 c k a 1 a 2 g k a 1 p k a 2 g k a 2 p k a 1 q k a 2 i f q k a 2 g k a 2 g k a 1 p k a 2 1 i f g k a 2 g k a 1 q k a 2 0 i f p k a 2 g k a 2 g k a 1 a total preference matrix c is formed using a method called weight averaging process w k presents the weight of criterion k 13 c a 1 a 2 k 1 n w k c k a 1 a 2 k 1 n w k a veto matrix d k is constructed using the matrix thresholds introduced earlier each element of the veto matrix is calculated using eq 14 14 d k a 1 a 2 g k a 1 p k a 2 g k a 2 τ k a 2 p k a 2 i f p k a 1 g k a 2 g k a 1 τ k a 2 1 i f τ k a 2 g k a 2 g k a 1 0 i f g k a 2 g k a 1 p k a 2 a total veto matrix d is formed afterward w k is referred to the weight of criterion k 15 d a 1 a 2 k 1 n w k d k a 1 a 2 k 1 n w k credibility matrix s is created using the total preference and veto matrices the elements of credibility matrix can be calculated using the following equation 16 s a 1 a 2 c a 1 a 2 i f d k a 1 a 2 c a 1 a 2 k c a 1 a 2 k i d k a 1 a 2 1 d k a 1 a 2 1 c a 1 a 2 o t h e r w i s e the discordance credibility degree is defined by φ and the concordance credibility degree is defined by φ which is the measure of the outranking character of xi xi dominates all the other alternatives of x the net credibility degree can be described by φ that is a value function where a higher value reveals a higher attractiveness of alternative xi li and wang 2007 φ φ and φ can be expressed as follows 17 φ x i x j x s x i x j x i x φ x i x j x s x j x i x i x φ x i φ x i φ x i x i x the alternatives are ranked according to their qualification from the best to the worst by the net credibility degree 4 study area annual water consumption in iran is about 93 4 billion cubic meters that include surface water and groundwater 93 of which is used for agriculture and less than 7 is allocated for domestic and industrial use zehtabian et al 2010 the average agricultural demand in the region is 1280 million cubic meters each year moghaddasi et al 2013 in iran groundwater is the principal source of water for irrigation and domestic and industrial use due to the increasing demand for potable and irrigation water and inadequacy of available surface water the importance of groundwater is increasing exponentially nagarajan et al 2010 about 55 of the water consumed in iran comes from groundwater and the rest is obtained from surface water from 1988 to 2006 consumption of groundwater compared to surface water increased significantly since agriculture depends on groundwater directly groundwater management is of high importance khosravi 2005 isfahan province is situated in the centre of iran this province covers an area of approximately 107 027 square kilometers according to the general census in 2011 the population of the province was 4 815 863 of which approximately 83 3 were urban residents and the remaining 16 7 resided in rural areas fig 4 shows the location map of the study area the climate in isfahan varies in different parts and is hot and dry in northern and eastern regions of the province but is semi humid in western areas and in south it is cold and semi arid in isfahan province the annual precipitation and temperature are 120 mm and 16 7 c respectively the minimum temperature during winter is 10 6 c and the maximum in the summer is 40 6 c geologically majority of the province is covered by sedimentary rocks like limestone dolomite evaporates sandstone and shale except along with zayandehrud river basin which is alluvium the soils in the study area include immature calcaric regosols lithic teptosols and haplic calcisols with undeveloped horizons keshavarzi et al 2015 in recent terraces alluvial deposit and undifferentiated terraces with an age of quaternary have been underlined in the southwest and south of the region the geology is lower cretaceous gray limestone containing orbitalin and jurassic shale comprising ammonite aridisoils belonging to different great groups such as calciargids haplocambids haplogypsids and haplosalids are the main soils in these parts of the province geological and hydrogeological properties of the different alternatives have been characterized for example fig 5 shows geological map of the study area and fig 6 illustrates the fault map in fig 7 drainage map of the study area with two clay and salt flat parts of isfahan province is shown 5 methodology the agriculture research centre of isfahan selected 10 locations out of 50 after a primary investigation for construction of a subsurface dam in the study area these 10 locations were ranked according to 14 criteria shown in fig 8 for criteria definition four main categories were defined including climate geology socioeconomic and hydrology in each main category sub criteria were defined as measurable items in the study area in large scale and more detailed criteria were left for next stages of details study for example water level or hydrodynamic parameters 5 1 relative weights a most crucial step in ssd site selection is criteria weighting in current research after defining the final criteria 10 experts were invited to give their opinions on the weight of each criterion through a questionnaire based on saaty scale 1 9 in this method the number 1 was given to the least and 9 to the most important criterion sub surface dam site selection criteria weights using mcdm method and the total collected results are given in table 1 as it is shown in this table the geometric mean method was used for averaging different expert s opinion and providing a unique value for each criterion the geometric mean of each row was used as the final weight of criteria and the pairwise comparison matrix was built different methods of calculating relative weight such as least squares least logarithmic squares eigenvector and approximation methods were implemented in this study approximation methods were used to define the relative weights approximation methods include row sum method the column sum method arithmetic average method and the geometric mean method weight vectors of the above methods were compared to those resulted by fuzzy delphi ahp chang 1996 and fuzzy ahp liu and chen 2007 methods and the final weights were then compared in fig 9 the inconsistency ratio is calculated to be equal to zero the suggested questionnaires by saaty 1990 was used to predict these values 6 application of combined electre method for ssd site selection with respect to 14 criteria and 10 alternatives that defined in this study the decision matrix of ssd site selection table 2 was prepared for each alternative the value of each criterion was calculated or collected since the study area is large and ssd construction is a new methodology in iran the experts in agricultural research centre arc of isfahan that completely know the area and also some academic experts from university fill the questionnaires and helped for the construction of the decision matrix some of the information like area of the upper basin distance from the faults and average annual rainfall was collected from the relevant maps and data sources in isfahan province finally the matrix was formed in both qualitative and quantitative formats table 2 qualitative parameters are then converted to quantitative ones based on the weights suggested by experts as given in table 3 this matrix is the final matrix that was used in the elctre process in next steps in this study alternatives a 1 a 2 a 3 a 10 are ranked according to criteria c 1 c 2 c 3 c 14 criteria c 1 c 4 and c 14 present a negative aspect and if they present a lower value for an alternative the chance of selecting that alternative is higher 6 1 application of electre i decision matrix is converted to the final dominance matrix as explained earlier in the methodology section number of times that each alternative is dominant or subordinate and the difference between them was determined the ranking and it shows in table 4 6 2 application of electre ii as mentioned in the methodology section strong and weak preference and veto thresholds are defined in electre ii preference and veto thresholds for strong dominance were 0 8 and 1 and preference and veto thresholds for weak dominance were defined 0 5 and 0 5 respectively final comparison dominance matrix is formed according to these thresholds as mentioned earlier for a better ranking result values 2 and 1 are given to s f and s f respectively the number of times that each of the alternatives are dominant or subordinate and the differences are necessary to determine the ranking and it shows in table 5 6 3 application of modified electre iii after creating the decision matrix the most important step is to specify the thresholds the thresholds are defined based on the experts suggestions preference matrixes c k for each criterion is created and the preference matrix for criterion 1 c 1 is created according to eq 8 preference matrices for criteria 2 14 are constructed using the same equation the total preference matrix c is created applying eq 13 in addition veto matrices d k for each criterion is created according to eq 14 the total veto matrix d is constructed according to eq 14 the credibility matrix s is created afterward according to eq 16 in the next step φ φ and φ are calculated based on eq 17 and the quantities are given in table 6 the final ranking is conducted by arranging the net credibility degrees φ from the largest quantity to the smallest 7 results and discussion in a multi criteria decision making problem various methods may be used and their results are not always the same therefore the optimum selection is not always clear in these situations different merging methods such as the grade average method borda method and copeland method hwang and yoon 1981 borda 1784 copeland 1951 are useful for combining the results and presenting a unique response for the problem different mcdm methods have been conducted for site selection of subsurface dams for example the ahp and fahp methods tavakoli et al 2018 boolean and fuzzy logic jamali et al 2018 and also ftopsis and edas kharazi et al 2019 have been used in previous studies in current research not only the electre method as an advanced method of mcdm has been used but also the application of integration strategies for coupling the results of different methods have been examined borda and copeland methods used in current study reduced the uncertainty in different results and present a unique response for selecting the appropriate location for ssd construction in this study the ranking results of electre i ii iii are shown in fig 10 and in next section ranking strategies will be applied 7 1 ranking strategies and hybrid electre 7 1 1 the grade average method in this method the arithmetic average of rankings using different methods are calculated for each alternative and final ranking is presented the alternative with the smaller arithmetic average is considered a better alternative in table 7 different rankings were merged by using the grade average final ranking with this method is shown in fig 11 also table 7 was used in creating the pairwise comparison matrix for the other ranking strategies 7 1 2 borda method in this method was introduced by borda 1784 and have been used widely in economic and social science borda 1784 in the borda method a pairwise comparison matrix is formed for choosing the best alternative in comparing two alternatives based on table 7 if the order that an alternative is dominated is greater than the order it is subordinated then it is given by 1 otherwise the value of 0 assigned to the related matrix elements after constructing the pairwise comparison matrix the row sum for each row shows the number of times that an alternative is preferred to the others and the alternatives are ranked based on this value table 8 7 1 3 copeland method copeland method is the modified version of the borda count the number of times that an alternative is subordinated or dominant is used to rank the alternatives like the borda method copeland 1951 lamboray 2007 after that the row sum and column sum for each alternative have been determined the final copeland number obtained from the difference of row sum and column sum for each alternative table 8 figs 12 and 13 show the application of borda and copeland methods for determining the final ranking of ssd alternatives in fig 14 results from the grade average borda count and copeland methods are compared with each other 8 conclusion subsurface dam site selection is conducted based on various criteria due to hydrogeological complexities this diversity of criteria and lack of information in the preliminary stages of the investigation lead to a complex and difficult decision making process especially if the prospecting area is regional locating the optimum location for subsurface dam construction will be difficult multi criteria decision making can be an effective approach to solving such complex problems since there are many methods of decision making using different methods can lead to different results and increase uncertainty three electre methods were combined using ranking strategies to form a hybrid method and suggest one location for further studies another issue in locating the subsurface dams is depending on the area under investigation and the geological geomorphological and hydrogeological conditions of the area there are numerous criteria for choosing the most suitable location in this study four categories of climatic geological hydrological and socio economic factors were used 14 sub criteria were chosen as main factors in this case study as the study area is large and there were limitations for detailed hydrogeological data this hybrid method enables researchers to suggest an optimum area using limited criteria it is recommended that further studies focus on the top alternatives and include more site based data to ensure the optimum area is selected for the subsurface dam construction the results show that the fuzzy method is not suitable for criteria weighting modified electre iii shows that alternative a5 hoseinabad was identified as the optimal site for the subsurface dam this alternative was also approved by those experts involved in this research and further field investigations criteria and method used in this study can be used as a preliminary planning step for subsurface dam construction and for more detailed field investigations declaration of competing interest there is not any conflict of interest acknowledgment the authors gratefully acknowledge the member of isfahan centre for research of agricultural

12118,groundwater is the only source of water for drinking domestic and agricultural needs in jaffna a district in northern sri lanka while the sustainability challenges to this groundwater resource in terms of water availability and quality have been highlighted and studied extensively through existing research household water consumption and management practices have been overlooked hence this study tried to investigate on household water consumption pattern and management practices along with comparing the effectiveness of different water management measures on reducing water deficit of the district the primary data was collected through a questionnaire survey from 142 households belonging to a water rich rural area a water scarce rural area a coastal area and an urban area the data was analyzed both quantitatively and qualitatively based on the results there was no statistically significant difference in average per capita consumption among the different areas studied and on average a person in jaffna sri lanka consumes 200 l per day also household size and households having their own water source are the two most important predictors of total water consumed in a household in addition more than half of the respondent households do not engage in water conservation at their households at present due to continuous access to water through their own water source further analysis on the effectiveness of management interventions by using water evaluation and planning system weap modeling on reducing deficit showed that if the current consumption patterns continue there will be an unmet demand of 51 7 million cubic meters mcm of water in the year 2030 on the other hand by implementing the management interventions such as increasing recharge reducing per capita consumption having additional water sources reducing non revenue water and installing a water treatment plant together all the water demand for the year 2030 can be met graphical abstract

in the pores of soil and cracks in the rocks groundwater foundation 2018 globally about 96 of the non frozen freshwater that is accessible for human consumption is in the form of groundwater gorelick and zheng 2015 smith et al 2016 bhattacharya and bundschuh 2016 groundwater contributes from 60 to 100 of water supply for arid and semi arid regions of the world bgr 2008 abiye 2016 groundwater has been the backbone for socio economic development of both urban and rural areas in africa asia and latin america and developing countries account for 71 of global abstraction of groundwater winjen et al 2012 groundwater has been the only source of supply for countries like denmark malta and saudi arabia and for cities in the developing countries including jakarta dhaka lima and mexico city unesco 2004 sampat 2000 globally 50 of drinking water and 43 of water for agriculture is derived from groundwater overall groundwater contributes to human wellbeing economic development and functioning of ecosystems smith et al 2016 however since it stays below the ground the understanding of this resource by both the public and decision makers has been low and compared to surface water it has not been covered much in the policies on water resource management gun 2012 smith et al 2016 population growth urbanization and economic growth are the main drivers affecting groundwater globally gun 2012 smith et al 2016 in fact in the last five decades global groundwater abstraction rate has tripled and it continues to increase by 1 2 every year smith et al 2016 in some places it has been abstracted beyond its renewal rate the regions that are facing high abstraction rate reducing storage and falling groundwater level belong to the areas that are located in the arid and semi arid zones aquifers with high decline in groundwater level have been observed in northern america europe the indus basin north china and australia gun 2012 smith et al 2016 dillon et al 2012 the majority of the groundwater extracted is used for irrigation in agriculture 70 followed by industrial 20 and domestic use 10 bgr 2008 cgiar 2017 gorelick and zheng 2015 unesco 2018 the increase in groundwater extraction across the world has been attributed to the silent revolution phenomenon which started in the early 20th century and continues till today under which the decision of individual users mainly farmers without any centralized decision making or planning have contributed to immense extraction of groundwater globally gun 2012 kemper 2007 the critical issues related to groundwater management across the world are over exploitation and its quality degradation due to pollution both of these issues result from the drivers such as access to pumping and drilling technology population growth urbanization economic development industrialization expansion in irrigated agriculture and land use change that lead to the increase in exploitation of groundwater resource gorelick and zheng 2015 over use of groundwater and its continuous degradation will have negative impacts on the availability of drinking water irrigation based agriculture and food security livelihoods of farmers associated economic development resilience to climate change and ecosystem services that groundwater provides also it will affect the ability of societies in the arid and semi arid regions to successfully transit into non groundwater based livelihoods through ensuring climate resilient water supply sustainable management of groundwater helps in achieving the various sustainable development goals related to food security renewable energy access to drinking water sustainable industrial development and cities smith et al 2016 bhattacharya and bundschuh 2016 protecting groundwater becomes imperative with regard to climate change particularly for those areas where water resources are likely to become scarce this is because groundwater has the buffering capacity and it is comparatively less likely to be affected by climate change as it is stored beneath the soil and stored in large volumes gun 2012 smith et al 2016 since groundwater is the only source of water in jaffna sri lanka the groundwater resource of jaffna experiences sustainability challenges due to quantity and quality issues over abstraction low water levels observed during the dry period increased salinity and water scarcity in coastal areas and quality issues such as increased salinity hardness nitrate concentration and microbial contamination have been highlighted in the existing literature on the water resources of jaffna sri lanka mikunthan et al 2013 shanmugarajah 1993 joshua et al 2013 kumara et al 2013 arulnesan et al 2015 few of the studies also have indicated the absence of policy and lack of sustainable management of groundwater resources in jaffna sri lanka tharmendra and sivakumar 2016 villholth and rajasooriyar 2010 sivakumar 2015 however there is no baseline information or studies on the current consumption patterns at household level the water management practices applied at household level and the perception of households on groundwater management from a demand side management for the conjunctive management of groundwater point of view knowledge on household water consumption patterns and their management practices are important in addition such information will also be important for proactive management for the sustainable management of the water resource therefore this study intended to gather information regarding water consumption pattern at household hh level in jaffna sri lanka along with identification of important factors affecting water consumption and management practices that are applied or that can be applied at the hh level further the effectiveness of applying some management interventions is evaluated by considering different scenarios 1 1 study area located in the extreme north end of sri lanka jaffna peninsula is one of the districts in the northern province of sri lanka with an area of 1021 01 square kilometers the population of jaffna in 2016 was 622 709 with one third of the families engaged in agriculture district secretariat jaffna 2017 the average annual rainfall of jaffna district is 1284 mm year of which 80 is received in the main maha season occurring between september to march and the rest is received during the yala season from april to may the dry season is from june to september the terrain of jaffna sri lanka is flat and the highest point is about 10 11 m above the mean sea level due to this condition there are no rivers or reservoirs in jaffna sri lanka mikunthan et al 2013 hence groundwater contained in the aquifer is the only source of water available for the various needs including domestic agricultural and industrial needs shanmugarajah 1993 farmers use electric or diesel pumps to abstract water from the dug wells in their farms similarly most households abstract water from dug wells or tube wells by using highly efficient electric or diesel pumps feasibility report 2006 with 19 934 agro wells the total number of open dug wells in jaffna peninsula is more than 100 000 district secretariat jaffna 2016 panabokke and perera 2005 according to the national water supply and drainage board nws db the main service provider for household water supply in jaffna sri lanka about 5 of the population is served by pipe born water the water board is supplying water that is abstracted through boreholes and open dug well and produced through reverse osmosis plant to households in the jaffna district in the jaffna peninsula the number of household connections for water supply has been increasing over the years due to pollution and ease of access particularly in coastal areas as it reduces the travelling distance and time since most of the industries are dry industries like carpentry and metal working shops water requirement of industries and commercial and other institutions are minimal and considered to be 10 of domestic water demand feasibility report 2006 2 methodology the study used a mixed method approach in terms of collecting and analyzing the data the primary data for the study was collected through interviews with experts working in the water sector in jaffna sri lanka to understand the context and through administering a household survey questionnaire from the interviews with the experts it was derived that water rich rural area water scarce rural area coastal area and urban area are the different regions with different water availability and consumption in jaffna sri lanka that need to be captured in this study four locations from point pedro nallur and karaveddy divisional secretariat ds divisions were selected for the study to represent the four different regional categories fig 1 these ds divisions were chosen due to easy access and the point pedro nallur and karaveddy ds divisions consist of 7 11 and 8 of the total households in the district respectively in total 163 randomly selected household samples were collected from aththai karaveddy east point pedro and nallur which represent water rich rural area water scarce rural area coastal area and urban area respectively the data was collected from september to november 2017 in this study people living in the same residence and sharing meals from a common source for the past 6 months were considered as a household hh from each of the selected household an adult member who is 18 years or above responded to the survey the survey questionnaire had four sections titled as household characteristics water source and usage water management at the household level and perceptions and experience of water related issues from the 163 samples 21 samples were discarded due to missing a lot of information and finally 142 samples were used for the analysis the collected data was analyzed both quantitatively and qualitatively the data was entered and analyzed by using microsoft excel ibm statistical package for the social sciences spss 20 and water evaluation and planning system weap software different statistical analysis such as descriptive statistics analysis of variance correlation and multiple regression were performed to analyze the data and extract relevant information for further analysis finally using the values extracted from the previous statistical analysis qualitative analysis and secondary data a scenario analysis was done by using the weap software to analyze the impact of different management interventions on unmet water demand in the jaffna district sri lanka for the years between 2016 and 2030 the secondary data used in this study was verified through interviews with the experts in the water sector such as authorities in the planning department officials of the national water supply and drainage board jaffna and professor of agriculture department at the university of jaffna 3 results and discussion 3 1 demographic and socio economic characteristics of the respondent households in total data from 142 household samples with 36 from aththai 35 from karaveddy east 36 from point pedro and 35 from nallur areas were considered for the analysis the areas aththai karaveddy east point pedro and nallur represent water rich rural area water scarce rural area coastal area and urban area respectively see table 1 among the respondents 72 were females and 28 were males there was not any bias in the selection of participants rather it was the result of conducting a household survey and who was available at the household during the visit further unlike rural areas in india where the responsibility to fetch water falls on the shoulders of women in jaffna there is no gender specific roles in terms of fetching and managing water singh et al 2004 2005 while most households have their own source of water in the households where drinking water is in a bad quality both men and women engage in fetching it it typically happens like who gets home first or who is free fetches the water both men and women ride bicycles or motorbikes in jaffna and bringing drinking water is not seen as a problem as the alternative water source is within close distance and it is not exclusive to one gender like the case in rural india household size ranged from 1 to 11 with a mean of 4 2 the number of adults in the household ranged from 1 to 8 with a mean of 3 2 and the number of children ranged from 0 to 4 with a mean of 0 95 while the monthly income of the households ranged from rs 2000 to rs 100 000 11 2 usd 560 6 usd the average monthly income was rs 35 831 200 9 usd among the respondents only 3 households 2 n 142 do not have access to electricity while the rest have access to electricity out of the 142 households 131 households 92 3 have a garden in their surroundings gardens in the context of jaffna sri lanka means having fruit trees flower trees coconut and areca nut trees around the household while most of the households do not water the gardens some do water the garden 3 2 main water source and ranking of end uses regarding the main water source 92 of the households 130 n 142 have their own source of water either in the form of a dug well 48 or tube well 44 only 5 7 n 142 of the households rely on the water supplied by the nws db as the main water source see fig 2 the rest 3 of the respondent households rely on either a shared well or shared tube well as their main water source here main water source means the water source that contributes to fulfilling majority of the water needs such as shower washing clothes cleaning utensils sanitation gardening and cleaning the house the reason for this is that many households use more than one water source in addition to the main water source the water from the other sources such as common well bottled water from water supply and rainwater are mainly used for cooking and drinking purposes among the respondent households 91 129 n 142 of the households use motor for abstraction while 9 13 n 142 does not require a motor for abstraction either due to their reliance on water from the nws db or due to manual abstraction the respondents ranked the various end uses of water at their household from one to nine by ranking the need that consumes the highest amount of water in a day as one and the need that consumes the least amount of water as nine in all the four studied areas respondents indicated that shower is the end use that consumes the highest amount of water in a household in a day even though there are differences in how respondents from the four areas ranked the other end uses it can be said that shower washing clothes and sanitation are the top three end uses that consume high amount of water in a household in jaffna sri lanka hence actions on demand management should focus on these three end uses to minimize the household water consumption this way per capita consumption can be reduced as these three end uses are personal end uses whereas the other end uses such as cleaning utensils cooking cleaning the house gardening and livestock rearing are collective end uses and some of these end uses are not required every day 3 3 water consumption pattern the total amount of water consumed by a household in a day varied largely from 44 l to 2430 l around 56 80 n 142 of the households consume less than 1000 l a day and 44 of the households consume 1000 l or more in a day only 20 29 n 142 of the households consume less than 500 l in a day water consumption per capita also varied widely from 44 l per capita per day lpcd to 500 lpcd only in one household a person consumes less than 50 l of water in a day which is the minimum required water consumption per capita suggested by the who un water decade programme on advocacy and communication and water supply and sanitation collaborative council n d in 12 of the studied households each member consumes less than 100 l in a day and in 57 of the studied households each member consume 200 lpcd or less only in three of the studied households each member consumes 500 lpcd as shown in fig 3 aththai which represents a water rich rural area has the highest average total water consumption with 886 l per household per day this is not surprising given majority of the households in aththai has a tube well of their own and they use a motor to abstract water for their consumption in addition aththai has the highest average household size among the study areas therefore with more family members total water consumption for a household in aththai would be higher than the other study areas point pedro which represents a coastal area has the second highest total water consumption in a household in a day with 796 l per household per day on the other hand nallur which represents an urban area has the lowest water consumption among the four areas with 727 l per household per day the reason for this could be with a household size of 3 8 nallur has the lowest household size compared to the other areas even though karaveddy east represents a water scarce rural area with an average total water consumption of 746 l per household per day it has higher total water consumption than nallur the difference between the means of total water consumption of aththai and nallur is 159 l per day which is a significant amount on the other hand per capita water consumption per day does not have a major difference between the high consuming and low consuming areas aththai has the highest per capita consumption with 205 l per capita per day lpcd and karaveddy east has the lowest per capita consumption per day with 195 lpcd to test for statistically significant variation among the different regions studied in terms of both total water consumed in a day and per capita consumption per day the parametric test of one way analysis of variance one way anova was performed according to the one way anova test results there was no statistically significant difference among the four areas studied in terms of both mean total water consumed in a household in a day f 3 138 0 810 p 0 490 and per capita consumption per day f 3 138 0 061 p 0 980 therefore it can be concluded that both the average total water consumed in a day and average per capita consumption per day do not vary statistically significantly among the four study areas therefore regional characteristics in terms of water availability do not have a significant influence on water consumption at the household level rather as 92 of the respondent households have their own source of water in the form of a dug well or a tube well it can be said that access to own source of water is an important factor making water consumption patterns similar across the studied areas 3 4 important predictors of household water consumption from a list of factors such as socio economic demographic household characteristics water source and water consumption patterns important predictors of household water consumption were identified through a multiple regression analysis initially there were 27 explanatory variables considered for their impact on total water consumed at a household in a day from these 27 variables 9 variables were finally selected for the multiple regression analysis through a correlation analysis by selecting the variables that had a significant correlation with total water consumption at a household see table 2 the nine independent variables selected for the multiple regression analysis include household size hhs highest education level hel having own source of water ows number of children in a household nc years of education of the head of the household ehh shower frequency sf household income hi having access to water for all 24 h aw and age of the head of the household ahh among the nine variables household size hhs had the highest positive correlation with total household water consumption r 0 505 p 0 01 see table 2 this indicates that with the increase in household size the total amount of water consumed by the household in a day also increases highest education level hel in the household was another variable positively correlated r 0 293 p 0 01 with total water consumed in a household this could be because when the highest education level in the household increases that means the person with highest education is likely to have a job in the service sector with government or private which in the case of jaffna sri lanka requires some travelling those people may shower more and wash clothes frequently also in this study highest education level in the household had a positive correlation with shower frequency r 0 129 another reason is that there is a strong positive statistically significant correlation between higher education level and household income r 0 540 p 0 05 which also indicates that people with higher education may lavishly use water without being concerned about the associated cost for electricity for abstraction however the relationship between travel distance for work and water use for personal end uses like showering need to be explored further in future studies by gathering data on travel distance years of education of the head of the household ehh was also positively correlated with the total water consumed in a household in this study r 0 197 p 0 05 the reason for this could be same as explained for the highest education level in the household in this study number of children in a household nc was also statistically significantly positively correlated with total water consumption in a household r 0 287 p 0 01 this could be because as children tend to play outside and dirty their clothes more water would be used for washing clothes in those households as mentioned earlier most of the respondent households use an electric motor for water abstraction for the higher income households the cost of electricity would not be a problem and they are likely to abstract water more frequently and use it extravagantly as indicated by a positive correlation with total water consumption r 0 147 similarly as explained earlier shower is the end use that consumes the largest amount of water in the households in jaffna sri lanka hence when people in a household take showers more frequently total water consumption of the household also increases r 0 152 having own source of water ows was another factor that was positively correlated to total water consumption r 0 288 p 0 01 this means that a household that has access to their own source of water is likely to consume more water than a household that does not have a personal source of water similar to having own source of continuous access to water aw makes households to be less concerned about water conservation and to use water lavishly which is evident both from the correlation analysis r 0 184 p 0 05 and from the responses to water management at household level further in this study age of the head of the household ahh was statistically significantly but negatively correlated with the total amount of water consumed at a household r 0 220 p 0 01 that is when the age of the head of the household increases the total amount of water consumed in a household decreases the reason for this could be the consciousness of the head of the household regarding water conservation as it was evident from the household survey of this study older respondents have experienced water shortage lack of continuous access to water or they did not have access to a personal source of water in their younger age this has made them conscious about water conservation and to be frugal in their water use due to this and their influence on their household those households that have an older household head are likely to use less water compared to a household with a younger household head using these nine independent variables selected a stepwise multiple regression analysis was performed by using spss to select the important predictors of household water consumption a stepwise multiple regression analysis has been applied in household water consumption studies across the world particularly to identify the significant explanatory variables from a set of explanatory variables basu et al 2017 fan et al 2013 hussien et al 2016 the multiple regression analysis used a p value less than 0 05 to enter the variable into the model and p value above 0 10 to remove the variable from the model from the 9 variables entered into the stepwise multiple regression analysis two variables were identified as significant predictors and retained in the model household size and having own water source are the two variables kept in the model the model is statistically significant f 9 135 29 051 p 0 0005 and predicts 30 4 of variation in total water consumption in a household per day both household size and having own water source are contributing statistically significant unique contribution to the model however among the two variables with a beta coefficient of 0 474 p 0 0005 household size contributes more to explaining the variation in total water consumption than having own water source which has a beta coefficient of 0 224 p 0 005 the findings of this study are comparable to other household water consumption studies a study on per capita consumption in iraq by hussien et al found that per capita water consumption increased with increase in income hussien et al 2016 the study by fan et al in china found that per capita consumption was negatively correlated with the age of the head of the household meaning an older member of a family is likely to consume less water than a younger member of a family partly because of their traditional practices related to water usage also they found that households that had access to water continuously consumed more water compared to households with intermittent water supply fan et al 2013 a household survey study of 10 oecd countries on household water consumption also found that household water consumption had statistically significant positive correlations with household income number of adults and number of children in the household grafton et al 2011 the study by timothy and paul in nigeria also found household size as an important predictor of household water consumption and it had a positive correlation with household water consumption timothy and paul 2014 a study done by fielding et al in australia also found that household water consumption increased with both household size and household income and household size was the strongest predictor of household water consumption fielding et al 2012 3 5 water management at the household level in the household survey under the water management at household level section the respondents were asked various questions regarding their engagement in water management activities at household their knowledge about water management and rooftop rainwater harvesting rwh technology and their interest in fixing a rwh structure at their household level all the respondents 142 answered the question regarding whether they conserve water at their household and 54 77 n 142 responded that they do not engage in water management activities at their household they stated that they are not interested in engaging in water conservation at their household due to reasons such as continuous availability of water from the well or pipe having enough water not facing any water shortage access to water from neighbors house even if there is shortage free availability of water carelessness and their thinking that water conservation is not required the 46 of households that engage in water conservation at household level responded that they conserve water through the following ways using water when it is required only avoiding wastage of water turning off taps when not in use cleaning utensils by collecting water in a bucket not watering plants every day storing water in cans for using it next day using water from food preparation in the kitchen to feed the cattle using grey water from kitchen shower and cleaning tanks to watering plants letting rainwater to recharge groundwater by digging the ground and collecting and storing rainwater in cans and using it to water plants furthermore from a list of water saving habits the respondents were also asked to indicate the water saving habits that they currently engage in based on the responses the practices that the households currently engage the most include actively looking for and fixing leaks turning off tap while not in use recycling waste water washing items such as dishes and clothes collectively instead of washing each item individually and mopping the floor instead of pouring water and cleaning it see fig 4 people seem to be engaged more in actively fixing leaks and turning off taps when not using them may be because of a common sense to avoid wasting of water recycling waste water seem to be a common practice and generally the water used in kitchen and bathroom are used for watering plants in the garden also water used for food preparation is used for feeding livestock while washing dishes and clothes together instead of washing each item individually helps in reducing water consumption dish washing is also influenced by the availability of tap in the kitchen households that do not have a tap in their kitchen collect water in a bucket and wash dishes together on the other hand some households that have access to tap water wash dishes individually right after the use rather than collectively washing them together later mopping the floor is also influenced by the type of floor a household has which is either a cement floor or floor made of tiles or terrazzo currently more and more households in jaffna sri lanka are switching to a floor made of tiles or terrazzo hence the households that have a marble floor engage more in mopping the floor and households that have cement floor generally engage more in rinsing the floor with water compared to the practices most commonly engaged in a little more than half of the respondents engage in taking fewer and shorter showers and pay attention to their water usage people in jaffna sri lanka generally take longer showers as witnessed from the data of this study and the duration can range from 5 to 30 min people take long showers as the temperature is generally above 25 c and due to recent increases in temperature also since most households have an individual source of water and water is continuously available to them people tend to be less concerned about shower duration or the amount of water used for showering this indicates lack of awareness among people regarding water consumption and the possibility for reducing water consumption by increasing their awareness on water management using and trying to switch to water efficient technologies collecting and using rainwater for household needs and reducing the consumption of bottled water are the activities that people are less engaged in at present generally there is less knowledge among the people regarding water efficient appliances or technologies this is the case partly because in the market except for commode toilet and washing machine generally there is no guidance or information given to the consumer when selling water appliances regarding water consumption and efficiency however even for commode toilet and washing machine though the amount of water that is used per activity can be gathered from the sellers consumers generally do not seek it when it comes to water using devices people are generally concerned about the price of the device and its longevity people generally do not engage in collecting rainwater and using it for household purposes for reasons including having continuous access to water from their own source and concerns about purity of rainwater the households that collect and use rainwater are the households that experience salinity and water hardness issues the collected rainwater is used for washing clothes curing wounds used in the radiator of vehicles and for cleaning the house reducing bottled water consumption is the activity that the respondents are least engaged in the reason for this is in jaffna sri lanka only those households that have health concern over drinking water either due to excessive calcium concentration or the likelihood for contamination of well water with litter pollutants during rainy season are the ones that consume bottled water therefore the respondents perceive that this consumption cannot be reduced further among the water efficient appliances that are used at the households at present a water efficient commode toilet is the most common appliance followed by low flow showerhead and low flow faucets whereas a water efficient washing machine is the least common appliance from the given list of reasons the most common reason stated for not using a water efficient technology or appliance is that the respondents do not think it is necessary to use them this is followed by the appliances technology being available in the market but it is expensive for their households these two reasons suggest that water management for jaffna sri lanka can be done by increasing the awareness of the people regarding water efficient technology and appliances and how they contribute to minimizing water use at household level in addition for those households that think these appliances technology are expensive there should be financial arrangements similar to the promotion of solar power which allow the households to get low interest loans that can be paid back in installments to purchase these appliances djordjevic 2017 nearly 57 79 n 139 of the respondents are aware of the water management concept among the given choices majority of the people learned about water management from education at school or university only few people learned about water management from government officials or through workshop or seminar programs in their offices however most of the people learned about water management from other sources such as television newspaper radio from other people experience of water shortage and social media among the respondents that answered the question on their awareness regarding rooftop rainwater harvesting technology 70 97 n 138 are already aware of rooftop rainwater harvesting when asked about their interest in fixing a rooftop rainwater harvesting rwh facility to their houses out of the 133 respondents who answered this question 39 52 n 133 stated they are not interested in fixing a rainwater harvesting rwh facility to their house among the others 35 46 n 133 expressed their interest in fixing a rwh structure if government or ngo provides it free and another 21 28 n 133 are interested in fixing it if it is provided through a subsidy or at a subsidized cost only 5 6 n 133 are willing to fix it at their own cost if the total cost is less than rs 50 000 322 usd hence 60 80 n 133 of the respondent households are willing to install a rwh facility at their house with the support from the government or other organizations or on their own this indicates a viable environment for promotion of rwh structure for households through government or other organizations in fact the nws db district secretariat and other ngos are currently providing support to interested households to set up rainwater harvesting facility which is provided free of cost among the respondent households only one from the water scarce karaveddy east area has already installed a rwh facility at their household which they got through the nws db for free this household is able to store 8000 l of rainwater and use the water for cooking and drinking purposes for a year among the respondents that expressed they are not interested in fixing a rwh at their household the reasons frequently attributed for the lack of interest include there is not a necessity for that as they are able to get water continuously from their own well or tube well not experiencing any water shortage lack of space to keep the tank and maintenance requirements concern regarding the purity of rainwater and unfamiliarity with using rainwater 3 6 effectiveness of management interventions in reducing unmet demand by using the information on the different demand sites and supply sources the existing water resource system of jaffna sri lanka was represented in the weap model in the current accounts see fig 5 the consumption and supply details of 2016 were used in the current accounts as 2016 was taken as the base year using the details in the current year the reference scenario was created by projecting changes in total water demand and total unmet demand in between the years 2016 and 2030 according to the current accounts estimations the total water demand and unmet demand in the jaffna district in the year 2016 are 196 0 million cubic meter mcm and 47 4 mcm respectively in the base year 2016 the water demand of the domestic agriculture and industry sectors are 44 5 mcm 147 mcm and 4 43 mcm respectively the reference scenario shows that if the current consumption patterns continue without any changes in the supply system there will be a total water demand of 203 4 mcm and unmet water demand of 51 7 mcm in the year 2030 fig 6 four management interventions were considered to see their individual impact on reducing the unmet demand by running four different scenarios based on them the four management interventions are increase in recharge reduction in per capita consumption having additional water sources and reduction in non revenue water as fig 7 shows increase in recharge by 33 3 leads to 31 mcm reduction in unmet demand compared to the reference scenario for the year 2030 next to increase in recharge reduction in per capita consumption that is everyone consuming 100 lpcd also significantly reduces unmet demand for the year 2030 from 51 7 mcm in the reference scenario to 37 1 mcm all the additional resources together reduce the unmet demand to 46 1 mcm from 51 7 mcm that of in the reference scenario for the year 2030 all the additional water resources include the major water supply scheme which comes to effect in 2020 and produces 24 000 cubic meter water per day and additional rainwater harvesting structures which are installed in 2018 and 2025 reduction in non revenue water leads to the lowest reduction in unmet demand with just 0 1 mcm reduction from that of the reference scenario for the year 2030 however this is not surprising as only 5 of the population of jaffna sri lanka is provided with supplied water and non revenue water is applicable for that population only hence a reduction in non revenue water from 20 to 10 does not contribute a major change in reducing deficit for the jaffna district comparison of the four management intervention scenarios highlight that increasing recharge and reducing per capita consumption have significant potential to reduce unmet demand therefore these two management interventions need to be implemented along with having additional water resources also the four scenarios have shown that while the management interventions are able to reduce the unmet demand none of the intervention alone can reduce the unmet demand to zero in addition to the scenarios based on individual management interventions two combination scenarios also were created by combining some of the drivers and or interventions and they are named as plausible future and optimistic future the plausible future scenario is created by combining the potential drivers and management interventions that would affect the water resources of jaffna sri lanka in between 2016 and 2030 the assumptions regarding drivers and management interventions considered in this scenario include industrial water demand doubles by 2030 per capita consumption is increased to 250 lpcd recharge is reduced to 20 of annual rainfall rainwater harvesting structures installed by 2018 and the major water supply scheme coming to effect in 2020 provide additional water resources and the climate is dry climate hence the drivers and management interventions that are likely to happen are considered in this scenario the optimistic future scenario on the other hand tries to see the combined effect of all the management interventions in reducing the unmet demand along with the four management interventions which were considered individually before a waste water treatment plant that provides 2 283 mcm treated water each month to agriculture starting from 2025 is also included in this scenario fig 8 shows that total water demand increases under all three scenarios reference plausible future and optimistic future scenarios however total water demand under the plausible future scenario is higher than both reference and optimistic future scenarios in all the years considered similarly as evident from fig 9 it has the highest unmet demand compared to the other two scenarios across all the years also it is important to note that while reference scenario shows a small slightly continuous increasing trend in unmet demand over the years the unmet demand under the optimistic future scenario becomes zero from 2025 for the year 2030 compared to the reference scenario total water demand is increased to 222 7 mcm in the plausible scenario and it is reduced to 178 1 mcm in the optimistic future scenario unmet demand on the other hand is increased from 51 7 mcm in the reference scenario in 2030 to 129 0 mcm under the plausible future scenario in the year 2030 and it is reduced to zero under the optimistic future scenario in 2030 therefore it is evident that even with the additional water sources considered due to the effect of the possible drivers which include industrial demand doubling by 2030 increase in per capita consumption reduction in recharge and dry climate together the total unmet demand is going to increase significantly by 77 3 mcm in the year 2030 this means there is going to be severe exploitation of the limestone aquifers of jaffna sri lanka as currently there is no restriction on the amount of water that can be abstracted from them this would lead to unsustainable use of the resource further quality degradation and threaten the long term sustainability of the resource eventually this would lead to a crisis situation as there is no other main water resource available in jaffna sri lanka than groundwater on the other hand as seen in the optimistic future scenario implementing all the four management interventions together along with having a waste water treatment plant helps in meeting all the water demand of the district in this study scenario approach was used to see the effectiveness of management interventions in reducing deficit and also to show the impact of both drivers and management interventions that are likely to affect the future of water resource of jaffna this was done to show as an example to indicate such type of approach and tools like weap can be used for water resources planning in a context where integrated water resources management is not yet considered in the planning and management of water resources the assumptions on drivers and management interventions considered came from the interviews and literature therefore uncertainty level was not considered and rather scenario approach was used as an example to show the impact of drivers and effectiveness of management interventions considered however it is important to consider the uncertainty involved particularly in adaptation to climate change in managing water resources for water resources planning hence future research and planning regarding water resource management in jaffna needs to consider the uncertainties involved in the drivers and potential management interventions that affect the water resources as well as involve a broad range of stakeholders and employ back casting and adaptive management methodology van der voorn et al 2012 2017 4 conclusion from a household survey with 142 households belonging to water rich rural area water scarce rural area coastal area and urban area of jaffna district sri lanka this study finds that there is no statistically significant variation among the regions in terms of total water consumed in a household and per capita consumption on average a person in jaffna sri lanka consumes 200 l of water in a day ease of abstraction of water by using an electric motor and continuous water availability via having own water source could be the reason for no statistically significant variation among the regions in the correlation analysis the factors that showed a positive correlation with total water consumed in a household include household size having own water source number of children highest education level in the household education level of the head of the household monthly income shower frequency and access to water for all 24 h the age of the head of the household showed a statistically significant negative correlation with total water consumed in a household using these nine variables that showed high correlation with total water consumed in a household in a day a multiple regression analysis was done the model created by the multiple regression analysis identified household size and having own water source as the important predictors of total water consumed in a household in a day the model is statistically significant and explains 30 4 of variation in total water consumed at a household regarding water conservation at the household level more than 50 of the respondent households stated that they do not engage in water conservation and the main reason for that is continuous water availability through own source of water among the water saving habits actively fixing leaks turning off taps when not in use mopping the floor recycling waste water and washing items collectively are the habits that the respondent households mostly engage in at present compared to those habits people engage less in taking fewer and shorter showers paying attention to their water usage using and trying to switch to water efficient technologies collecting and using rainwater and reducing the consumption of bottled water among the water efficient appliances that are used at the households at present a water efficient commode toilet is the most common appliance and a water efficient washing machine is the least common appliance more than half of the respondents are already aware of water management and rooftop rainwater harvesting technology about 60 of the respondents are willing to install a rainwater harvesting structure at their household with 5 willing to fix it at their own cost if the cost is below rs 50 000 and the rest willing to fix it if it is provided free or through subsidies the scenario modeling by using the water evaluation and planning system weap software enabled comparing different what if scenarios based on different drivers management interventions or both the reference scenario shows that if the current consumption patterns continue without any interruption there will be an unmet water demand of 51 7 mcm in the year 2030 while each of the management intervention is able to reduce the unmet water demand to some extent none of them were able to reduce it to zero when applied individually one of the combination scenarios called the optimistic future shows that when all the management interventions such as increase in recharge reduction in per capita consumption having additional water sources and reduction in non revenue water along with a water treatment plant are implemented together there is no unmet demand for the year 2030 hence to avoid future water shortage and manage the groundwater resource of jaffna sri lanka sustainably it is important to implement all the management interventions together this study indicates how a trans disciplinary study with the application of weap model can be used for effective water resource planning and management recommendations based on the findings of this study the following recommendations are put forward to manage the groundwater resource of jaffna sri lanka sustainably with the participation of households first of all the current per capita consumption is 200 lpcd which is twice the minimal water requirement of 50 100 l to fulfill most of the basic needs including drinking sanitation washing of clothes food preparation and personal and household hygiene suggested by the world health organization un water decade programme on advocacy and communication and water supply and sanitation collaborative council n d therefore there is potential for demand management by reducing per capita consumption to reduce per capita consumption first the public need to be informed about on average how much water is required for a person to fulfill all the basic needs and they need to be made aware that in fact they are using more water than required and the importance of water conservation per capita consumption can be reduced by promoting the usage of water efficient appliances such as water efficient toilet low flow shower heads water efficient washing machines and taps with aerators by establishing market that provides such appliances along with water efficiency labeling the awareness can be provided by designated official from divisional secretariat visiting households explaining the need for conservation and providing information regarding household water management similar to the public health awareness program on dengue fever through the visits of public health inspectors as the respondents have indicated visit by officials would help the households to learn about water conservation as well as to take it seriously and practice it in addition awareness information can be shared in newspapers and social media currently less people are engaged in rainwater harvesting at their household and some people are concerned about collecting and using rainwater as they are not familiar with it and also for hygiene reasons therefore there should be some awareness given on the suitability of rainwater for household consumption furthermore the existing rwh distribution programs to households for free through the nws db district secretariat and ngos needs to be scaled up and financial incentives or rebates can also be used to encourage the public to install rwhs at households on their own furthermore the public need to be given basic knowledge on how groundwater moves so that they will understand their over abstraction can have negative consequences for nearby households and may reduce their abstraction in addition the negative impact of cementing the front and backyards on recharge need to be explained to people in order for households to contribute to groundwater recharge in the long term in order to control groundwater abstraction by households the district may choose to provide pipe water supply to all the households along with volumetric pricing and not to allow households to have a personal source of water by restricting the use of wells and tube wells the volumetric pricing could be done in a way that it enables all the households to afford the supplied water to fulfill their basic needs but beyond the allowed limit the charges for each additional unit are made prohibitively expensive however viability of such a scheme need to be seen in terms of associated costs and acceptance by households according to the government notification in march 2017 all those industries or commercial agricultural activities that extract more than 30 000 l of water per month which is more than 1000 l a day should obtain a perimeter protection report from the water resources board and they also need to provide relevant information about their water source however this is applicable only for industries and commercial activities and still there is no restriction on the domestic sector on those households that abstract more than 1000 l of water per day in fact as can be seen from the results of this study there are households that abstract more than 1000 l per day therefore the requirements that are expected of the industries and commercial activities can be extended to households as well this would also help in ensuring the water quality standards are met and the data is available for long term monitoring and for taking actions in addition the existing ponds which are about 1000 in number but are not maintained should be renovated to enable them to contribute to recharge also places suitable for artificial recharge need to be explored by using the gis technology and the local government should support managed aquifer recharge gis technology can also be used to identify safe zone and protected zones for groundwater development permeable pavements also should be installed in places and roads that are being replaced with concrete to increase recharge furthermore there should be a policy or legislation that requires all the newly established houses business institutions public buildings to have both rainwater harvesting structures and water efficient appliances installed in fact in the neighboring country india in its 18 states installation of rainwater harvesting structure has been made mandatory for all the new buildings arfanuzzaman and rahman 2017 furthermore the district should develop a development strategy which also considers the sustainability of its water resources through a water policy such a development strategy may promote the cultivation of less water intensive crops use of water efficient irrigation technology and collective sustainable commercial agricultural farms which would make it easy to manage agricultural water consumption and provide sustained income for farmers also such a strategy should also consider ongoing resettlement and livelihood support activities and provide houses with water efficient appliances and rainwater harvesting structures as wells as provide livelihood support for less water intensive jobs for the resettling families in addition in the long term the district may choose to install a water treatment plant that can provide treated household waste water for agriculture this would reduce freshwater withdrawal from the aquifer as agriculture is currently the major consumer of total abstracted water finally even though there has been a lot of research on the water resources of jaffna sri lanka they remain fragmented and there is no major collaboration among the researchers this results in a lot of data but the data is scattered and inconclusive therefore there should be an umbrella research program under the university of jaffna that would allow for continuous data collection timely monitoring and for developing solutions to sustainably manage the groundwater resource of jaffna sri lanka such a research program should involve the students academics organizations related to water such as the national water supply drainage board water resources board irrigation department and department of agriculture district secretariat the general public and farmers as a whole in order to manage the groundwater resource of jaffna sri lanka sustainably the district should implement management interventions proactively by following integrated water resource management approach and the weap model can be used as a tool for integrated water resource planning declarations of interest none acknowledgements this study was supported by the thesis research allowance

12118,groundwater is the only source of water for drinking domestic and agricultural needs in jaffna a district in northern sri lanka while the sustainability challenges to this groundwater resource in terms of water availability and quality have been highlighted and studied extensively through existing research household water consumption and management practices have been overlooked hence this study tried to investigate on household water consumption pattern and management practices along with comparing the effectiveness of different water management measures on reducing water deficit of the district the primary data was collected through a questionnaire survey from 142 households belonging to a water rich rural area a water scarce rural area a coastal area and an urban area the data was analyzed both quantitatively and qualitatively based on the results there was no statistically significant difference in average per capita consumption among the different areas studied and on average a person in jaffna sri lanka consumes 200 l per day also household size and households having their own water source are the two most important predictors of total water consumed in a household in addition more than half of the respondent households do not engage in water conservation at their households at present due to continuous access to water through their own water source further analysis on the effectiveness of management interventions by using water evaluation and planning system weap modeling on reducing deficit showed that if the current consumption patterns continue there will be an unmet demand of 51 7 million cubic meters mcm of water in the year 2030 on the other hand by implementing the management interventions such as increasing recharge reducing per capita consumption having additional water sources reducing non revenue water and installing a water treatment plant together all the water demand for the year 2030 can be met graphical abstract

2004 sampat 2000 globally 50 of drinking water and 43 of water for agriculture is derived from groundwater overall groundwater contributes to human wellbeing economic development and functioning of ecosystems smith et al 2016 however since it stays below the ground the understanding of this resource by both the public and decision makers has been low and compared to surface water it has not been covered much in the policies on water resource management gun 2012 smith et al 2016 population growth urbanization and economic growth are the main drivers affecting groundwater globally gun 2012 smith et al 2016 in fact in the last five decades global groundwater abstraction rate has tripled and it continues to increase by 1 2 every year smith et al 2016 in some places it has been abstracted beyond its renewal rate the regions that are facing high abstraction rate reducing storage and falling groundwater level belong to the areas that are located in the arid and semi arid zones aquifers with high decline in groundwater level have been observed in northern america europe the indus basin north china and australia gun 2012 smith et al 2016 dillon et al 2012 the majority of the

extraction across the world has been attributed to the silent revolution phenomenon which started in the early 20th century and continues till today under which the decision of individual users mainly farmers without any centralized decision making or planning have contributed to immense extraction of groundwater globally gun 2012 kemper 2007 the critical issues related to groundwater management across the world are over exploitation and its quality degradation due to pollution both of these issues result from the drivers such as access to pumping and drilling technology population growth

over use of groundwater and its continuous degradation will have negative impacts on the availability of drinking water irrigation based agriculture and food security livelihoods of farmers associated economic development resilience to climate change and ecosystem services that groundwater provides also it will affect the ability of societies in the arid and semi arid regions to successfully transit into non groundwater based livelihoods through ensuring climate resilient water supply sustainable management of groundwater helps in achieving the various sustainable development goals related to food security renewable energy access to drinking water sustainable industrial development and cities smith et al 2016 bhattacharya and bundschuh 2016 protecting groundwater becomes imperative with regard to climate change particularly for those areas where water resources are likely to become scarce this is because groundwater has the buffering capacity and it is comparatively less likely to be affected by climate change as it is stored beneath the soil and stored in large volumes gun 2012 smith et al 2016 since groundwater is the only source of water in jaffna sri lanka the groundwater resource of jaffna experiences sustainability challenges due to quantity and quality issues over abstraction low water levels observed during the dry period increased salinity and water scarcity in coastal areas and quality issues such as increased salinity hardness nitrate concentration and microbial contamination have been highlighted in the existing literature on the water resources of jaffna sri lanka mikunthan et al 2013 shanmugarajah 1993 joshua et al 2013 kumara et al 2013 arulnesan et al 2015 few of the studies also have indicated the absence of policy and lack of sustainable management of groundwater resources in jaffna sri lanka tharmendra and sivakumar 2016 villholth and rajasooriyar 2010 sivakumar 2015 however there is no baseline information or studies on the current consumption patterns at household level the water management practices applied at household level and the perception of households on groundwater management from a demand side management for the conjunctive management of groundwater point of view knowledge on household water consumption patterns and their management practices are important in addition such information will also be important for proactive management for the sustainable management of the water resource therefore this study intended to gather information regarding water consumption pattern at household hh level in jaffna sri lanka along with identification of important factors affecting water consumption and management practices that are applied or that can be applied at the hh level further the effectiveness of applying some management interventions is evaluated by considering different scenarios 1 1 study area located in the extreme north end of sri lanka jaffna peninsula is one of the districts in the northern province of sri lanka with an area of 1021 01 square kilometers the population of jaffna in 2016 was 622 709 with one third of the families engaged in agriculture district secretariat jaffna 2017 the average annual rainfall of jaffna district is 1284 mm year of which 80 is received in the main maha season occurring between september to march and the rest is received during the yala season from april to may the dry season is from june to september the terrain of jaffna sri lanka is flat and the highest point is about 10 11 m above the mean sea level due to this condition there are no rivers or reservoirs in jaffna sri lanka mikunthan et al 2013 hence groundwater contained in the aquifer is the only source of water available for the various needs including domestic agricultural and industrial needs shanmugarajah 1993 farmers use electric or diesel pumps to abstract water from the dug wells in their farms similarly most households abstract water from dug wells or tube wells by using highly efficient electric or diesel pumps feasibility report 2006 with 19 934 agro wells the total number of open dug wells in jaffna peninsula is more than 100 000 district secretariat jaffna 2016 panabokke and perera 2005 according to the national water supply and drainage board nws db the main service provider for household water supply in jaffna sri lanka about 5 of the population is served by pipe born water the water board is supplying water that is abstracted through boreholes and open dug well and produced through reverse osmosis plant to households in the jaffna district in the jaffna peninsula the number of household connections for water supply has been increasing over the years due to pollution and ease of access particularly in coastal areas as it reduces the travelling distance and time since most of the industries are dry industries like carpentry and metal working shops water requirement of industries and commercial and other institutions are minimal and considered to be 10 of domestic water demand feasibility report 2006 2 methodology the study used a mixed method approach in terms of collecting and analyzing the data the primary data for the study was collected through interviews with experts working in the water sector in jaffna sri lanka to understand the context and through administering a household survey questionnaire from the interviews with the experts it was derived that water rich rural area water scarce rural area coastal area and urban area are the different regions with different water availability and consumption in jaffna sri lanka that need to be captured in this study four locations from point pedro nallur and karaveddy divisional secretariat ds divisions were selected for the study to represent the four different regional categories fig 1 these ds divisions were chosen due to easy access and the point pedro nallur and karaveddy ds divisions consist of 7 11 and 8 of the total households in the district respectively in total 163 randomly selected household samples were collected from aththai karaveddy east point pedro and nallur which represent water rich rural area water scarce rural area coastal area and urban area respectively the data was collected from september to november 2017 in this study people living in the same residence and sharing meals from a common source for the past 6 months were considered as a household hh from each of the selected household an adult member who is 18 years or above responded to the survey the survey questionnaire had four sections titled as household characteristics water source and usage water management at the household level and perceptions and experience of water related issues from the 163 samples 21 samples were discarded due to missing a lot of information and finally 142 samples were used for the analysis the collected data was analyzed both quantitatively and qualitatively the data was entered and analyzed by using microsoft excel ibm statistical package for the social sciences spss 20 and water evaluation and planning system weap software different statistical analysis such as descriptive statistics analysis of variance correlation and multiple regression were performed to analyze the data and extract relevant information for further analysis finally using the values extracted from the previous statistical analysis qualitative analysis and secondary data a scenario analysis was done by using the weap software to analyze the impact of different management interventions on unmet water demand in the jaffna district sri lanka for the years between 2016 and 2030 the secondary data used in this study was verified through interviews with the experts in the water sector such as authorities in the planning department officials of the national water supply and drainage board jaffna and professor of agriculture department at the university of jaffna 3 results and discussion 3 1 demographic and socio economic characteristics of the respondent households in total data from 142 household samples with 36 from aththai 35 from karaveddy east 36 from point pedro and 35 from nallur areas were considered for the analysis the areas aththai karaveddy east point pedro and nallur represent water rich rural area water scarce rural area coastal area and urban area respectively see table 1 among the respondents 72 were females and 28 were males there was not any bias in the selection of participants rather it was the result of conducting a household survey and who was available at the household during the visit further unlike rural areas in india where the responsibility to fetch water falls on the shoulders of women in jaffna there is no gender specific roles in terms of fetching and managing water singh et al 2004 2005 while most households have their own source of water in the households where drinking water is in a bad quality both men and women engage in fetching it it typically happens like who gets home first or who is free fetches the water both men and women ride bicycles or motorbikes in jaffna and bringing drinking water is not seen as a problem as the alternative water source is within close distance and it is not exclusive to one gender like the case in rural india household size ranged from 1 to 11 with a mean of 4 2 the number of adults in the household ranged from 1 to 8 with a mean of 3 2 and the number of children ranged from 0 to 4 with a mean of 0 95 while the monthly income of the households ranged from rs 2000 to rs 100 000 11 2 usd 560 6 usd the average monthly income was rs 35 831 200 9 usd among the respondents only 3 households 2 n 142 do not have access to electricity while the rest have access to electricity out of the 142 households 131 households 92 3 have a garden in their surroundings gardens in the context of jaffna sri lanka means having fruit trees flower trees coconut and areca nut trees around the household while most of the households do not water the gardens some do water the garden 3 2 main water source and ranking of end uses regarding the main water source 92 of the households 130 n 142 have their own source of water either in the form of a dug well 48 or tube well 44 only 5 7 n 142 of the households rely on the water supplied by the nws db as the main water source see fig 2 the rest 3 of the respondent households rely on either a shared well or shared tube well as their main water source here main water source means the water source that contributes to fulfilling majority of the water needs such as shower washing clothes cleaning utensils sanitation gardening and cleaning the house the reason for this is that many households use more than one water source in addition to the main water source the water from the other sources such as common well bottled water from water supply and rainwater are mainly used for cooking and drinking purposes among the respondent households 91 129 n 142 of the households use motor for abstraction while 9 13 n 142 does not require a motor for abstraction either due to their reliance on water from the nws db or due to manual abstraction the respondents ranked the various end uses of water at their household from one to nine by ranking the need that consumes the highest amount of water in a day as one and the need that consumes the least amount of water as nine in all the four studied areas respondents indicated that shower is the end use that consumes the highest amount of water in a household in a day even though there are differences in how respondents from the four areas ranked the other end uses it can be said that shower washing clothes and sanitation are the top three end uses that consume high amount of water in a household in jaffna sri lanka hence actions on demand management should focus on these three end uses to minimize the household water consumption this way per capita consumption can be reduced as these three end uses are personal end uses whereas the other end uses such as cleaning utensils cooking cleaning the house gardening and livestock rearing are collective end uses and some of these end uses are not required every day 3 3 water consumption pattern the total amount of water consumed by a household in a day varied largely from 44 l to 2430 l around 56 80 n 142 of the households consume less than 1000 l a day and 44 of the households consume 1000 l or more in a day only 20 29 n 142 of the households consume less than 500 l in a day water consumption per capita also varied widely from 44 l per capita per day lpcd to 500 lpcd only in one household a person consumes less than 50 l of water in a day which is the minimum required water consumption per capita suggested by the who un water decade programme on advocacy and communication and water supply and sanitation collaborative council n d in 12 of the studied households each member consumes less than 100 l in a day and in 57 of the studied households each member consume 200 lpcd or less only in three of the studied households each member consumes 500 lpcd as shown in fig 3 aththai which represents a water rich rural area has the highest average total water consumption with 886 l per household per day this is not surprising given majority of the households in aththai has a tube well of their own and they use a motor to abstract water for their consumption in addition aththai has the highest average household size among the study areas therefore with more family members total water consumption for a household in aththai would be higher than the other study areas point pedro which represents a coastal area has the second highest total water consumption in a household in a day with 796 l per household per day on the other hand nallur which represents an urban area has the lowest water consumption among the four areas with 727 l per household per day the reason for this could be with a household size of 3 8 nallur has the lowest household size compared to the other areas even though karaveddy east represents a water scarce rural area with an average total water consumption of 746 l per household per day it has higher total water consumption than nallur the difference between the means of total water consumption of aththai and nallur is 159 l per day which is a significant amount on the other hand per capita water consumption per day does not have a major difference between the high consuming and low consuming areas aththai has the highest per capita consumption with 205 l per capita per day lpcd and karaveddy east has the lowest per capita consumption per day with 195 lpcd to test for statistically significant variation among the different regions studied in terms of both total water consumed in a day and per capita consumption per day the parametric test of one way analysis of variance one way anova was performed according to the one way anova test results there was no statistically significant difference among the four areas studied in terms of both mean total water consumed in a household in a day f 3 138 0 810 p 0 490 and per capita consumption per day f 3 138 0 061 p 0 980 therefore it can be concluded that both the average total water consumed in a day and average per capita consumption per day do not vary statistically significantly among the four study areas therefore regional characteristics in terms of water availability do not have a significant influence on water consumption at the household level rather as 92 of the respondent households have their own source of water in the form of a dug well or a tube well it can be said that access to own source of water is an important factor making water consumption patterns similar across the studied areas 3 4 important predictors of household water consumption from a list of factors such as socio economic demographic household characteristics water source and water consumption patterns important predictors of household water consumption were identified through a multiple regression analysis initially there were 27 explanatory variables considered for their impact on total water consumed at a household in a day from these 27 variables 9 variables were finally selected for the multiple regression analysis through a correlation analysis by selecting the variables that had a significant correlation with total water consumption at a household see table 2 the nine independent variables selected for the multiple regression analysis include household size hhs highest education level hel having own source of water ows number of children in a household nc years of education of the head of the household ehh shower frequency sf household income hi having access to water for all 24 h aw and age of the head of the household ahh among the nine variables household size hhs had the highest positive correlation with total household water consumption r 0 505 p 0 01 see table 2 this indicates that with the increase in household size the total amount of water consumed by the household in a day also increases highest education level hel in the household was another variable positively correlated r 0 293 p 0 01 with total water consumed in a household this could be because when the highest education level in the household increases that means the person with highest education is likely to have a job in the service sector with government or private which in the case of jaffna sri lanka requires some travelling those people may shower more and wash clothes frequently also in this study highest education level in the household had a positive correlation with shower frequency r 0 129 another reason is that there is a strong positive statistically significant correlation between higher education level and household income r 0 540 p 0 05 which also indicates that people with higher education may lavishly use water without being concerned about the associated cost for electricity for abstraction however the relationship between travel distance for work and water use for personal end uses like showering need to be explored further in future studies by gathering data on travel distance years of education of the head of the household ehh was also positively correlated with the total water consumed in a household in this study r 0 197 p 0 05 the reason for this could be same as explained for the highest education level in the household in this study number of children in a household nc was also statistically significantly positively correlated with total water consumption in a household r 0 287 p 0 01 this could be because as children tend to play outside and dirty their clothes more water would be used for washing clothes in those households as mentioned earlier most of the respondent households use an electric motor for water abstraction for the higher income households the cost of electricity would not be a problem and they are likely to abstract water more frequently and use it extravagantly as indicated by a positive correlation with total water consumption r 0 147 similarly as explained earlier shower is the end use that consumes the largest amount of water in the households in jaffna sri lanka hence when people in a household take showers more frequently total water consumption of the household also increases r 0 152 having own source of water ows was another factor that was positively correlated to total water consumption r 0 288 p 0 01 this means that a household that has access to their own source of water is likely to consume more water than a household that does not have a personal source of water similar to having own source of continuous access to water aw makes households to be less concerned about water conservation and to use water lavishly which is evident both from the correlation analysis r 0 184 p 0 05 and from the responses to water management at household level further in this study age of the head of the household ahh was statistically significantly but negatively correlated with the total amount of water consumed at a household r 0 220 p 0 01 that is when the age of the head of the household increases the total amount of water consumed in a household decreases the reason for this could be the consciousness of the head of the household regarding water conservation as it was evident from the household survey of this study older respondents have experienced water shortage lack of continuous access to water or they did not have access to a personal source of water in their younger age this has made them conscious about water conservation and to be frugal in their water use due to this and their influence on their household those households that have an older household head are likely to use less water compared to a household with a younger household head using these nine independent variables selected a stepwise multiple regression analysis was performed by using spss to select the important predictors of household water consumption a stepwise multiple regression analysis has been applied in household water consumption studies across the world particularly to identify the significant explanatory variables from a set of explanatory variables basu et al 2017 fan et al 2013 hussien et al 2016 the multiple regression analysis used a p value less than 0 05 to enter the variable into the model and p value above 0 10 to remove the variable from the model from the 9 variables entered into the stepwise multiple regression analysis two variables were identified as significant predictors and retained in the model household size and having own water source are the two variables kept in the model the model is statistically significant f 9 135 29 051 p 0 0005 and predicts 30 4 of variation in total water consumption in a household per day both household size and having own water source are contributing statistically significant unique contribution to the model however among the two variables with a beta coefficient of 0 474 p 0 0005 household size contributes more to explaining the variation in total water consumption than having own water source which has a beta coefficient of 0 224 p 0 005 the findings of this study are comparable to other household water consumption studies a study on per capita consumption in iraq by hussien et al found that per capita water consumption increased with increase in income hussien et al 2016 the study by fan et al in china found that per capita consumption was negatively correlated with the age of the head of the household meaning an older member of a family is likely to consume less water than a younger member of a family partly because of their traditional practices related to water usage also they found that households that had access to water continuously consumed more water compared to households with intermittent water supply fan et al 2013 a household survey study of 10 oecd countries on household water consumption also found that household water consumption had statistically significant positive correlations with household income number of adults and number of children in the household grafton et al 2011 the study by timothy and paul in nigeria also found household size as an important predictor of household water consumption and it had a positive correlation with household water consumption timothy and paul 2014 a study done by fielding et al in australia also found that household water consumption increased with both household size and household income and household size was the strongest predictor of household water consumption fielding et al 2012 3 5 water management at the household level in the household survey under the water management at household level section the respondents were asked various questions regarding their engagement in water management activities at household their knowledge about water management and rooftop rainwater harvesting rwh technology and their interest in fixing a rwh structure at their household level all the respondents 142 answered the question regarding whether they conserve water at their household and 54 77 n 142 responded that they do not engage in water management activities at their household they stated that they are not interested in engaging in water conservation at their household due to reasons such as continuous availability of water from the well or pipe having enough water not facing any water shortage access to water from neighbors house even if there is shortage free availability of water carelessness and their thinking that water conservation is not required the 46 of households that engage in water conservation at household level responded that they conserve water through the following ways using water when it is required only avoiding wastage of water turning off taps when not in use cleaning utensils by collecting water in a bucket not watering plants every day storing water in cans for using it next day using water from food preparation in the kitchen to feed the cattle using grey water from kitchen shower and cleaning tanks to watering plants letting rainwater to recharge groundwater by digging the ground and collecting and storing rainwater in cans and using it to water plants furthermore from a list of water saving habits the respondents were also asked to indicate the water saving habits that they currently engage in based on the responses the practices that the households currently engage the most include actively looking for and fixing leaks turning off tap while not in use recycling waste water washing items such as dishes and clothes collectively instead of washing each item individually and mopping the floor instead of pouring water and cleaning it see fig 4 people seem to be engaged more in actively fixing leaks and turning off taps when not using them may be because of a common sense to avoid wasting of water recycling waste water seem to be a common practice and generally the water used in kitchen and bathroom are used for watering plants in the garden also water used for food preparation is used for feeding livestock while washing dishes and clothes together instead of washing each item individually helps in reducing water consumption dish washing is also influenced by the availability of tap in the kitchen households that do not have a tap in their kitchen collect water in a bucket and wash dishes together on the other hand some households that have access to tap water wash dishes individually right after the use rather than collectively washing them together later mopping the floor is also influenced by the type of floor a household has which is either a cement floor or floor made of tiles or terrazzo currently more and more households in jaffna sri lanka are switching to a floor made of tiles or terrazzo hence the households that have a marble floor engage more in mopping the floor and households that have cement floor generally engage more in rinsing the floor with water compared to the practices most commonly engaged in a little more than half of the respondents engage in taking fewer and shorter showers and pay attention to their water usage people in jaffna sri lanka generally take longer showers as witnessed from the data of this study and the duration can range from 5 to 30 min people take long showers as the temperature is generally above 25 c and due to recent increases in temperature also since most households have an individual source of water and water is continuously available to them people tend to be less concerned about shower duration or the amount of water used for showering this indicates lack of awareness among people regarding water consumption and the possibility for reducing water consumption by increasing their awareness on water management using and trying to switch to water efficient technologies collecting and using rainwater for household needs and reducing the consumption of bottled water are the activities that people are less engaged in at present generally there is less knowledge among the people regarding water efficient appliances or technologies this is the case partly because in the market except for commode toilet and washing machine generally there is no guidance or information given to the consumer when selling water appliances regarding water consumption and efficiency however even for commode toilet and washing machine though the amount of water that is used per activity can be gathered from the sellers consumers generally do not seek it when it comes to water using devices people are generally concerned about the price of the device and its longevity people generally do not engage in collecting rainwater and using it for household purposes for reasons including having continuous access to water from their own source and concerns about purity of rainwater the households that collect and use rainwater are the households that experience salinity and water hardness issues the collected rainwater is used for washing clothes curing wounds used in the radiator of vehicles and for cleaning the house reducing bottled water consumption is the activity that the respondents are least engaged in the reason for this is in jaffna sri lanka only those households that have health concern over drinking water either due to excessive calcium concentration or the likelihood for contamination of well water with litter pollutants during rainy season are the ones that consume bottled water therefore the respondents perceive that this consumption cannot be reduced further among the water efficient appliances that are used at the households at present a water efficient commode toilet is the most common appliance followed by low flow showerhead and low flow faucets whereas a water efficient washing machine is the least common appliance from the given list of reasons the most common reason stated for not using a water efficient technology or appliance is that the respondents do not think it is necessary to use them this is followed by the appliances technology being available in the market but it is expensive for their households these two reasons suggest that water management for jaffna sri lanka can be done by increasing the awareness of the people regarding water efficient technology and appliances and how they contribute to minimizing water use at household level in addition for those households that think these appliances technology are expensive there should be financial arrangements similar to the promotion of solar power which allow the households to get low interest loans that can be paid back in installments to purchase these appliances djordjevic 2017 nearly 57 79 n 139 of the respondents are aware of the water management concept among the given choices majority of the people learned about water management from education at school or university only few people learned about water management from government officials or through workshop or seminar programs in their offices however most of the people learned about water management from other sources such as television newspaper radio from other people experience of water shortage and social media among the respondents that answered the question on their awareness regarding rooftop rainwater harvesting technology 70 97 n 138 are already aware of rooftop rainwater harvesting when asked about their interest in fixing a rooftop rainwater harvesting rwh facility to their houses out of the 133 respondents who answered this question 39 52 n 133 stated they are not interested in fixing a rainwater harvesting rwh facility to their house among the others 35 46 n 133 expressed their interest in fixing a rwh structure if government or ngo provides it free and another 21 28 n 133 are interested in fixing it if it is provided through a subsidy or at a subsidized cost only 5 6 n 133 are willing to fix it at their own cost if the total cost is less than rs 50 000 322 usd hence 60 80 n 133 of the respondent households are willing to install a rwh facility at their house with the support from the government or other organizations or on their own this indicates a viable environment for promotion of rwh structure for households through government or other organizations in fact the nws db district secretariat and other ngos are currently providing support to interested households to set up rainwater harvesting facility which is provided free of cost among the respondent households only one from the water scarce karaveddy east area has already installed a rwh facility at their household which they got through the nws db for free this household is able to store 8000 l of rainwater and use the water for cooking and drinking purposes for a year among the respondents that expressed they are not interested in fixing a rwh at their household the reasons frequently attributed for the lack of interest include there is not a necessity for that as they are able to get water continuously from their own well or tube well not experiencing any water shortage lack of space to keep the tank and maintenance requirements concern regarding the purity of rainwater and unfamiliarity with using rainwater 3 6 effectiveness of management interventions in reducing unmet demand by using the information on the different demand sites and supply sources the existing water resource system of jaffna sri lanka was represented in the weap model in the current accounts see fig 5 the consumption and supply details of 2016 were used in the current accounts as 2016 was taken as the base year using the details in the current year the reference scenario was created by projecting changes in total water demand and total unmet demand in between the years 2016 and 2030 according to the current accounts estimations the total water demand and unmet demand in the jaffna district in the year 2016 are 196 0 million cubic meter mcm and 47 4 mcm respectively in the base year 2016 the water demand of the domestic agriculture and industry sectors are 44 5 mcm 147 mcm and 4 43 mcm respectively the reference scenario shows that if the current consumption patterns continue without any changes in the supply system there will be a total water demand of 203 4 mcm and unmet water demand of 51 7 mcm in the year 2030 fig 6 four management interventions were considered to see their individual impact on reducing the unmet demand by running four different scenarios based on them the four management interventions are increase in recharge reduction in per capita consumption having additional water sources and reduction in non revenue water as fig 7 shows increase in recharge by 33 3 leads to 31 mcm reduction in unmet demand compared to the reference scenario for the year 2030 next to increase in recharge reduction in per capita consumption that is everyone consuming 100 lpcd also significantly reduces unmet demand for the year 2030 from 51 7 mcm in the reference scenario to 37 1 mcm all the additional resources together reduce the unmet demand to 46 1 mcm from 51 7 mcm that of in the reference scenario for the year 2030 all the additional water resources include the major water supply scheme which comes to effect in 2020 and produces 24 000 cubic meter water per day and additional rainwater harvesting structures which are installed in 2018 and 2025 reduction in non revenue water leads to the lowest reduction in unmet demand with just 0 1 mcm reduction from that of the reference scenario for the year 2030 however this is not surprising as only 5 of the population of jaffna sri lanka is provided with supplied water and non revenue water is applicable for that population only hence a reduction in non revenue water from 20 to 10 does not contribute a major change in reducing deficit for the jaffna district comparison of the four management intervention scenarios highlight that increasing recharge and reducing per capita consumption have significant potential to reduce unmet demand therefore these two management interventions need to be implemented along with having additional water resources also the four scenarios have shown that while the management interventions are able to reduce the unmet demand none of the intervention alone can reduce the unmet demand to zero in addition to the scenarios based on individual management interventions two combination scenarios also were created by combining some of the drivers and or interventions and they are named as plausible future and optimistic future the plausible future scenario is created by combining the potential drivers and management interventions that would affect the water resources of jaffna sri lanka in between 2016 and 2030 the assumptions regarding drivers and management interventions considered in this scenario include industrial water demand doubles by 2030 per capita consumption is increased to 250 lpcd recharge is reduced to 20 of annual rainfall rainwater harvesting structures installed by 2018 and the major water supply scheme coming to effect in 2020 provide additional water resources and the climate is dry climate hence the drivers and management interventions that are likely to happen are considered in this scenario the optimistic future scenario on the other hand tries to see the combined effect of all the management interventions in reducing the unmet demand along with the four management interventions which were considered individually before a waste water treatment plant that provides 2 283 mcm treated water each month to agriculture starting from 2025 is also included in this scenario fig 8 shows that total water demand increases under all three scenarios reference plausible future and optimistic future scenarios however total water demand under the plausible future scenario is higher than both reference and optimistic future scenarios in all the years considered similarly as evident from fig 9 it has the highest unmet demand compared to the other two scenarios across all the years also it is important to note that while reference scenario shows a small slightly continuous increasing trend in unmet demand over the years the unmet demand under the optimistic future scenario becomes zero from 2025 for the year 2030 compared to the reference scenario total water demand is increased to 222 7 mcm in the plausible scenario and it is reduced to 178 1 mcm in the optimistic future scenario unmet demand on the other hand is increased from 51 7 mcm in the reference scenario in 2030 to 129 0 mcm under the plausible future scenario in the year 2030 and it is reduced to zero under the optimistic future scenario in 2030 therefore it is evident that even with the additional water sources considered due to the effect of the possible drivers which include industrial demand doubling by 2030 increase in per capita consumption reduction in recharge and dry climate together the total unmet demand is going to increase significantly by 77 3 mcm in the year 2030 this means there is going to be severe exploitation of the limestone aquifers of jaffna sri lanka as currently there is no restriction on the amount of water that can be abstracted from them this would lead to unsustainable use of the resource further quality degradation and threaten the long term sustainability of the resource eventually this would lead to a crisis situation as there is no other main water resource available in jaffna sri lanka than groundwater on the other hand as seen in the optimistic future scenario implementing all the four management interventions together along with having a waste water treatment plant helps in meeting all the water demand of the district in this study scenario approach was used to see the effectiveness of management interventions in reducing deficit and also to show the impact of both drivers and management interventions that are likely to affect the future of water resource of jaffna this was done to show as an example to indicate such type of approach and tools like weap can be used for water resources planning in a context where integrated water resources management is not yet considered in the planning and management of water resources the assumptions on drivers and management interventions considered came from the interviews and literature therefore uncertainty level was not considered and rather scenario approach was used as an example to show the impact of drivers and effectiveness of management interventions considered however it is important to consider the uncertainty involved particularly in adaptation to climate change in managing water resources for water resources planning hence future research and planning regarding water resource management in jaffna needs to consider the uncertainties involved in the drivers and potential management interventions that affect the water resources as well as involve a broad range of stakeholders and employ back casting and adaptive management methodology van der voorn et al 2012 2017 4 conclusion from a household survey with 142 households belonging to water rich rural area water scarce rural area coastal area and urban area of jaffna district sri lanka this study finds that there is no statistically significant variation among the regions in terms of total water consumed in a household and per capita consumption on average a person in jaffna sri lanka consumes 200 l of water in a day ease of abstraction of water by using an electric motor and continuous water availability via having own water source could be the reason for no statistically significant variation among the regions in the correlation analysis the factors that showed a positive correlation with total water consumed in a household include household size having own water source number of children highest education level in the household education level of the head of the household monthly income shower frequency and access to water for all 24 h the age of the head of the household showed a statistically significant negative correlation with total water consumed in a household using these nine variables that showed high correlation with total water consumed in a household in a day a multiple regression analysis was done the model created by the multiple regression analysis identified household size and having own water source as the important predictors of total water consumed in a household in a day the model is statistically significant and explains 30 4 of variation in total water consumed at a household regarding water conservation at the household level more than 50 of the respondent households stated that they do not engage in water conservation and the main reason for that is continuous water availability through own source of water among the water saving habits actively fixing leaks turning off taps when not in use mopping the floor recycling waste water and washing items collectively are the habits that the respondent households mostly engage in at present compared to those habits people engage less in taking fewer and shorter showers paying attention to their water usage using and trying to switch to water efficient technologies collecting and using rainwater and reducing the consumption of bottled water among the water efficient appliances that are used at the households at present a water efficient commode toilet is the most common appliance and a water efficient washing machine is the least common appliance more than half of the respondents are already aware of water management and rooftop rainwater harvesting technology about 60 of the respondents are willing to install a rainwater harvesting structure at their household with 5 willing to fix it at their own cost if the cost is below rs 50 000 and the rest willing to fix it if it is provided free or through subsidies the scenario modeling by using the water evaluation and planning system weap software enabled comparing different what if scenarios based on different drivers management interventions or both the reference scenario shows that if the current consumption patterns continue without any interruption there will be an unmet water demand of 51 7 mcm in the year 2030 while each of the management intervention is able to reduce the unmet water demand to some extent none of them were able to reduce it to zero when applied individually one of the combination scenarios called the optimistic future shows that when all the management interventions such as increase in recharge reduction in per capita consumption having additional water sources and reduction in non revenue water along with a water treatment plant are implemented together there is no unmet demand for the year 2030 hence to avoid future water shortage and manage the groundwater resource of jaffna sri lanka sustainably it is important to implement all the management interventions together this study indicates how a trans disciplinary study with the application of weap model can be used for effective water resource planning and management recommendations based on the findings of this study the following recommendations are put forward to manage the groundwater resource of jaffna sri lanka sustainably with the participation of households first of all the current per capita consumption is 200 lpcd which is twice the minimal water requirement of 50 100 l to fulfill most of the basic needs including drinking sanitation washing of clothes food preparation and personal and household hygiene suggested by the world health organization un water decade programme on advocacy and communication and water supply and sanitation collaborative council n d therefore there is potential for demand management by reducing per capita consumption to reduce per capita consumption first the public need to be informed about on average how much water is required for a person to fulfill all the basic needs and they need to be made aware that in fact they are using more water than required and the importance of water conservation per capita consumption can be reduced by promoting the usage of water efficient appliances such as water efficient toilet low flow shower heads water efficient washing machines and taps with aerators by establishing market that provides such appliances along with water efficiency labeling the awareness can be provided by designated official from divisional secretariat visiting households explaining the need for conservation and providing information regarding household water management similar to the public health awareness program on dengue fever through the visits of public health inspectors as the respondents have indicated visit by officials would help the households to learn about water conservation as well as to take it seriously and practice it in addition awareness information can be shared in newspapers and social media currently less people are engaged in rainwater harvesting at their household and some people are concerned about collecting and using rainwater as they are not familiar with it and also for hygiene reasons therefore there should be some awareness given on the suitability of rainwater for household consumption furthermore the existing rwh distribution programs to households for free through the nws db district secretariat and ngos needs to be scaled up and financial incentives or rebates can also be used to encourage the public to install rwhs at households on their own furthermore the public need to be given basic knowledge on how groundwater moves so that they will understand their over abstraction can have negative consequences for nearby households and may reduce their abstraction in addition the negative impact of cementing the front and backyards on recharge need to be explained to people in order for households to contribute to groundwater recharge in the long term in order to control groundwater abstraction by households the district may choose to provide pipe water supply to all the households along with volumetric pricing and not to allow households to have a personal source of water by restricting the use of wells and tube wells the volumetric pricing could be done in a way that it enables all the households to afford the supplied water to fulfill their basic needs but beyond the allowed limit the charges for each additional unit are made prohibitively expensive however viability of such a scheme need to be seen in terms of associated costs and acceptance by households according to the government notification in march 2017 all those industries or commercial agricultural activities that extract more than 30 000 l of water per month which is more than 1000 l a day should obtain a perimeter protection report from the water resources board and they also need to provide relevant information about their water source however this is applicable only for industries and commercial activities and still there is no restriction on the domestic sector on those households that abstract more than 1000 l of water per day in fact as can be seen from the results of this study there are households that abstract more than 1000 l per day therefore the requirements that are expected of the industries and commercial activities can be extended to households as well this would also help in ensuring the water quality standards are met and the data is available for long term monitoring and for taking actions in addition the existing ponds which are about 1000 in number but are not maintained should be renovated to enable them to contribute to recharge also places suitable for artificial recharge need to be explored by using the gis technology and the local government should support managed aquifer recharge gis technology can also be used to identify safe zone and protected zones for groundwater development permeable pavements also should be installed in places and roads that are being replaced with concrete to increase recharge furthermore there should be a policy or legislation that requires all the newly established houses business institutions public buildings to have both rainwater harvesting structures and water efficient appliances installed in fact in the neighboring country india in its 18 states installation of rainwater harvesting structure has been made mandatory for all the new buildings arfanuzzaman and rahman 2017 furthermore the district should develop a development strategy which also considers the sustainability of its water resources through a water policy such a development strategy may promote the cultivation of less water intensive crops use of water efficient irrigation technology and collective sustainable commercial agricultural farms which would make it easy to manage agricultural water consumption and provide sustained income for farmers also such a strategy should also consider ongoing resettlement and livelihood support activities and provide houses with water efficient appliances and rainwater harvesting structures as wells as provide livelihood support for less water intensive jobs for the resettling families in addition in the long term the district may choose to install a water treatment plant that can provide treated household waste water for agriculture this would reduce freshwater withdrawal from the aquifer as agriculture is currently the major consumer of total abstracted water finally even though there has been a lot of research on the water resources of jaffna sri lanka they remain fragmented and there is no major collaboration among the researchers this results in a lot of data but the data is scattered and inconclusive therefore there should be an umbrella research program under the university of jaffna that would allow for continuous data collection timely monitoring and for developing solutions to sustainably manage the groundwater resource of jaffna sri lanka such a research program should involve the students academics organizations related to water such as the national water supply drainage board water resources board irrigation department and department of agriculture district secretariat the general public and farmers as a whole in order to manage the groundwater resource of jaffna sri lanka sustainably the district should implement management interventions proactively by following integrated water resource management approach and the weap model can be used as a tool for integrated water resource planning declarations of interest none acknowledgements this study was supported by the thesis research allowance

distribution of the major ions showed that they are below their maximum allowable limits the predominant ions are so4 2 na and ca2 it was observed that 85 of the groundwater samples are na so4 water 10 are ca so4 water whereas 5 represent mg so4 water the heavy metals distribution in the samples is in the order fe pb zn ni cr zn and cr concentrations were found below their respective standard limits however 75 of the total samples are fe contaminated 40 are ni contaminated while 50 are pb contaminated based on pig classification 80 of the water samples have insignificant pollution level and hence are suitable for drinking purposes however 20 of the samples have very high pollution level and are therefore unsuitable for human consumption similarly eri revealed that 20 of the samples pose very high ecological risk while 80 pose low ecological risk hca grouped the analyzed samples into two major clusters first cluster has 80 of water suitable for drinking while second cluster has 20 of water unsuitable for human consumption therefore this research recommends the treatment of contaminated groundwater before human consumption graphical abstract image 1 keywords drinking water

presence of so4 in the groundwater system could possibly be attributed to acidic lateritic soils acid precipitation fulvic humic soils and oxic conditions that could convert sulfide h2s in soil to sulphate eq 7 avci et al 2018 egbueri et al 2019 in addition it is possible that the decay of available organic matters can accelerate sulfide enrichment in soils of the study area whereas oxygen dissolution could enhance sulphate productions reports have also shown that the abundance of na so4 water facies over ca so4 in an area could be indicating that the solubility of na2so4 is higher than that of caso4 hence so4 2 readily reacts to combine with the na than the ca2 avci et al 2018 although the concentration of no3 was below the maximum permissible limit of 50 mg l its presence in water

distribution in groundwater the distribution of heavy metals in the analyzed groundwater samples is shown in fig 5 on the basis of their geometric mean values the heavy metals distribution in the groundwater samples is in the order fe pb zn ni cr it was observed that 75 of the groundwater samples are contaminated with fe exceeding the benchmark value of 0 3 mg l by the nis and who this can cause several negative effects such as bitter and astringent taste of water promotion of microbial growth and scaling in water distribution systems discoloration of cloth and plumbing fixtures and red hot disease nis 2007 who 2017 egbueri 2019b the presence of excess fe in the samples can be attributed to natural and anthropogenic processes the natural processes that could release fe in water include redox conditions of iron bearing minerals in soils and rocks and the rusting processes of water distribution pipes egbueri 2018 mgbenu and egbueri 2019 on the other hand the anthropogenic sources that could release fe in water include industrial waste leachates and mechanic workshop activities zn and cr concentrations were found below their respective standard limits of 3 mg l and 0 05 mg l hence the consumers do not risk health challenges due to zn and cr contaminations however consumers are exposed to adverse health risks due to ni and pb contaminations as their values in some samples were above their standard limits of 0 02 mg l and 0 01 mg l respectively table 2 in this study 40 of the total samples are ni contaminated whereas 50 of the samples are pb contaminated the enrichment of the groundwater with ni and pb could be linked to anthropogenic inputs such as ni pb batteries automobile mechanic workshops electronic wastes dumpsites industrial plants and industrial air conditioning egbueri 2018 mgbenu and egbueri 2019 health risks due to ni have been reported to include cancer lung damage and dermatitis who 2017 mgbenu and egbueri 2019 on the other hand the adverse health effects of pb contamination in water include mental retardation nervous systems disorder inhibition of vitamin d metabolism sleeplessness and restlessness in children acute psychosis anaemia impaired hearing and blood cells formation and cancer development nis 2007 who 2017 egbueri 2018 mgbenu and egbueri 2019 3 3 pollution index of groundwater pig in the assessment of pig the relative contributions of the chemical variables from each groundwater sample were examined according to subba rao 2012 an overall chemical quality of water ow greater than 0 1 contributes 10 value of 1 0 of the pig thereby giving a clear cut information on the influence of the parameter contaminating the groundwater body in this current study the ow for ph and all the chemical ions were below 0 1 table 3 indicating that they have low impact in the pollution of the groundwater however the heavy metals except for zn and cr in some samples recorded ow greater than 0 1 based on the information provided in table 3 pb has the highest impact on the water quality of the samples this is very evident in the ow and final pig values obtained the final pig values obtained from this study ranged from 0 114 to 20 845 the degree of pollution of drinking water has been classified into five groups pig 1 0 indicates an insignificant pollution 1 0 1 5 indicates low pollution 1 5 2 0 signifies moderate pollution 2 0 2 5 signifies high pollution and pig 2 5 indicates very high pollution table 4 subba rao 2012 subba rao et al 2018 subba rao and chaudhary 2019 based on this classification scheme it was observed that 80 of the groundwater samples have insignificant pollution level and hence are suitable for drinking purposes however 20 of the samples have very high pollution level and therefore are very unsuitable for human consumption the samples identified as unsuitable for drinking are those that possibly received the highest anthropogenic inputs and they are observed from the northern part of the study area table 3 fig 1 3 4 ecological risk index eri prior to the evaluation of the eri the ri potential ecological risk was first determined for each of the heavy metals and water samples table 5 according to bhutiani et al 2017 adimalla and wang 2018 and taiwo et al 2019 ri is classified into five to express the impact of a heavy metal on the quality of a sample ri 40 low potential ecological risk 40 ri 80 moderate potential ecological risk 80 ri 160 considerable potential ecological risk 160 ri 320 high potential ecological risk and 320 very high potential ecological risk based on this classification in the current study fe zn and cr pose low potential ecological risks however it was observed that ni poses moderate potential ecological risk to samples 14 and 19 while pb poses very high ecological risk to samples 1 14 19 and 20 table 5 the final eri values obtained from this analysis ranged from 0 037 to 1075 547 based on the eri values the groundwater can be classified into four categories eri 150 low ecological risk 150 eri 300 moderate ecological risk 300 eri 600 considerable ecological risk and 600 very high ecological risk adimalla and wang 2018 taiwo et al 2019 in this study the eri results further revealed that 20 of the samples pose very high ecological risk while 80 pose low ecological risk tables 4 and 5 it was observed that those samples identified by the pig to have very high pollution level are the same identified by the eri as posing very high ecological risk a correlation analysis was conducted on the pig and eri values using spss software v 22 a perfect correlation of 1 000 at significant at the 0 01 level 2 tailed was observed between the pig and eri values fig 6 this proves that both indices employed in this study were efficient in identifying the variations in the groundwater quality of the study area 3 5 hierarchical cluster analysis hca using the ward s linkage method and z score standardization to remove bias in the parameter values two dendrograms were produced based on the results of pig and eri assessments in fig 7 a pig classified the groundwater into two clusters the first cluster comprises of sixteen samples 7 15 6 12 16 17 3 11 4 5 2 18 10 13 8 and 9 which are certified to have insignificant pollution the second cluster comprises of four groundwater samples 1 20 14 and 19 which are very highly polluted similarly in fig 7b two clusters were obtained based on the eri the first cluster is an assemblage of groundwater samples 10 13 8 7 16 17 3 11 6 12 15 4 5 18 9 and 2 that pose low ecological risk on the other hand cluster 2 has the four samples 1 20 14 and 19 that pose very high ecological risk following these cluster observations another dendrogram not shown in this study that integrated the pig and eri values was produced and similar cluster result was produced summarily the hca used in this study grouped the analyzed samples into two major clusters first cluster has 80 of water suitable for drinking which are thought to be less influenced by anthropogenic factors while second cluster has 20 of water unsuitable for human consumption which are believed to receive more of anthropogenic inputs 4 conclusions this study has revealed the efficiency and efficacy of pollution index of groundwater pig ecological risk index eri and hierarchical cluster analysis hca in the drinking groundwater quality assessment of ojoto suburb southeast nigeria based on the findings of this research the following conclusions are given 1 majority about 80 of the analyzed groundwater samples are acceptable and suitable for drinking purposes however this study indicated that both natural processes and anthropogenic activities influence the chemistry and quality of the water resources 2 the distribution of the major ions showed that they are below their maximum allowable limits the predominant ions are so4 2 na and ca2 the order of dominance of the cations and anions is na ca2 k mg2 and so4 2 cl no3 hco3 respectively it was observed that 85 of the groundwater samples are na so4 water 10 are ca so4 water whereas 5 represent mg so4 water 3 the heavy metals distribution in the samples is in the order fe pb zn ni cr zn and cr concentrations were found below their respective standard limits all the hand dug wells were free from heavy metals contamination however 75 of the total samples are fe contaminated 40 are ni contaminated while 50 are pb contaminated 4 based on the pig classification 80 of the water samples have insignificant pollution level and hence are suitable for drinking purposes however 20 of the samples have very high pollution level and are therefore unsuitable for human consumption the samples identified as unsuitable for drinking are those that received the highest anthropogenic input 5 fe zn and cr pose low potential ecological risks however ni poses moderate potential ecological risk to 10 of the samples while pb poses very high ecological risk to 20 of the samples overall the eri revealed that 20 of the samples pose very high ecological risk while 80 pose low ecological risk 6 the hca grouped the analyzed samples into two major clusters first cluster has 80 of water suitable for drinking while second cluster has 20 of water unsuitable for human consumption 7 therefore this research recommends the treatment of contaminated groundwater before human consumption also adequate groundwater protection programs should be adopted as the aquifers are relatively shallow appendix a supplementary data the following is

is linked to poor waste disposal methods that characterize the fast developing suburb subba rao et al 2018 egbueri 2018 2019a 2019b subba rao and chaudhary 2019 7 2h2o h2s o2 h2so4 2h 3 2 heavy metals distribution in groundwater the distribution of heavy metals in the analyzed groundwater samples is shown in fig 5 on the basis of their geometric mean values the heavy metals distribution in the groundwater samples is in the order fe pb zn ni cr it was observed that 75 of the groundwater samples are contaminated with fe exceeding the benchmark value of 0 3 mg l by the nis and who this can cause several negative effects such as bitter and astringent taste of water promotion of microbial growth and scaling in water distribution systems discoloration of cloth and plumbing fixtures and red hot disease nis 2007 who 2017 egbueri 2019b the presence of excess fe in the samples can be attributed to natural and anthropogenic processes the natural processes that could release fe in water include redox conditions of iron bearing minerals in soils and rocks and the rusting processes of water distribution pipes egbueri 2018 mgbenu and egbueri 2019 on the other hand the anthropogenic sources that could release fe in water include industrial waste leachates and mechanic workshop activities zn and cr concentrations were found below their respective standard limits of 3 mg l and 0 05 mg l hence the consumers do not risk health challenges due to zn and cr contaminations however consumers are exposed to adverse health risks due to ni and pb contaminations as their values in some samples were above their standard limits of 0 02 mg l and 0 01 mg l respectively table 2 in this study 40 of the total samples are ni contaminated whereas 50 of the samples are pb contaminated the enrichment of the groundwater with ni and pb could be linked to anthropogenic inputs such as ni pb batteries automobile mechanic workshops electronic wastes dumpsites industrial plants and industrial air conditioning egbueri 2018 mgbenu and egbueri 2019 health risks due to ni have been reported to include cancer lung damage and dermatitis who 2017 mgbenu and egbueri 2019 on the other hand the adverse health effects of pb contamination in water include mental retardation nervous systems disorder inhibition of vitamin d metabolism sleeplessness and restlessness in children acute psychosis anaemia impaired hearing and blood cells formation and cancer development nis 2007 who 2017 egbueri 2018 mgbenu and egbueri 2019 3 3 pollution index of groundwater pig in the assessment of pig the relative contributions of the chemical variables from each groundwater sample were examined according to subba rao 2012 an overall chemical quality of water ow greater than 0 1 contributes 10 value of 1 0 of the pig thereby giving a clear cut information on the influence of the parameter contaminating the groundwater body in this current study the ow for ph and all the chemical ions were below 0 1 table 3 indicating that they have low impact in the pollution of the groundwater however the heavy metals except for zn and cr in some samples recorded ow greater than 0 1 based on the information provided in table 3 pb has the highest impact on the water quality of the samples this is very evident in the ow and final pig values obtained the final pig values obtained from this study ranged from 0 114 to 20 845 the degree of pollution of drinking water has been classified into five groups pig 1 0 indicates an insignificant pollution 1 0 1 5 indicates low pollution 1 5 2 0 signifies moderate pollution 2 0 2 5 signifies high pollution and pig 2 5 indicates very high pollution table 4 subba rao 2012 subba rao et al 2018 subba rao and chaudhary 2019 based on this classification scheme it was observed that 80 of the groundwater samples have insignificant pollution level and hence are suitable for drinking purposes however 20 of the samples have very high pollution level and therefore are very unsuitable for human consumption the samples identified as unsuitable for drinking are those that possibly received the highest anthropogenic inputs and they are observed from the northern part of the study area table 3 fig 1 3 4 ecological risk index eri prior to the evaluation of the eri the ri potential ecological risk was first determined for each of the heavy metals and water samples table 5 according to bhutiani et al 2017 adimalla and wang 2018 and taiwo et al 2019 ri is classified into five to express the impact of a heavy metal on the quality of a sample ri 40 low potential ecological risk 40 ri 80 moderate potential ecological risk 80 ri 160 considerable potential ecological risk 160 ri 320 high potential ecological risk and 320 very high potential ecological risk based on this classification in the current study fe zn and cr pose low potential ecological risks however it was observed that ni poses moderate potential ecological risk to samples 14 and 19 while pb poses very high ecological risk to samples 1 14 19 and 20 table 5 the final eri values obtained from this analysis ranged from 0 037 to 1075 547 based on the eri values the groundwater can be classified into four categories eri 150 low ecological risk 150 eri 300 moderate ecological risk 300 eri 600 considerable ecological risk and 600 very high ecological risk adimalla and wang 2018 taiwo et al 2019 in this study the eri results further revealed that 20 of the samples pose very high ecological risk while 80 pose low ecological risk tables 4 and 5 it was observed that those samples identified by the pig to have very high pollution level are the same identified by the eri as posing very high ecological risk a correlation analysis was conducted on the pig and eri values using spss software v 22 a perfect correlation of 1 000 at significant at the 0 01 level 2 tailed was observed between the pig and eri values fig 6 this proves that both indices employed in this study were efficient in identifying the variations in the groundwater quality of the study area 3 5 hierarchical cluster analysis hca using the ward s linkage method and z score standardization to remove bias in the parameter values two dendrograms were produced based on the results of pig and eri assessments in fig 7 a pig classified the groundwater into two clusters the first cluster comprises of sixteen samples 7 15 6 12 16 17 3 11 4 5 2 18 10 13 8 and 9 which are certified to have insignificant pollution the second cluster comprises of four groundwater samples 1 20 14 and 19 which are very highly polluted similarly in fig 7b two clusters were obtained based on the eri the first cluster is an assemblage of groundwater samples 10 13 8 7 16 17 3 11 6 12 15 4 5 18 9 and 2 that pose low ecological risk on the other hand cluster 2 has the four samples 1 20 14 and 19 that pose very high ecological risk following these cluster observations another dendrogram not shown in this study that integrated the pig and eri values was produced and similar cluster result was produced summarily the hca used in this study grouped the analyzed samples into two major clusters first cluster has 80 of water suitable for drinking which are thought to be less influenced by anthropogenic factors while second cluster has 20 of water unsuitable for human consumption which are believed to receive more of anthropogenic inputs 4 conclusions this study has revealed the efficiency and efficacy of pollution index of groundwater pig ecological risk index eri and hierarchical cluster analysis hca in the drinking groundwater quality assessment of ojoto suburb southeast nigeria based on the findings of this research the following conclusions are given 1 majority about 80 of the analyzed groundwater samples are acceptable and suitable for drinking purposes however this study indicated that both natural processes and anthropogenic activities influence the chemistry and quality of the water resources 2 the distribution of the major ions showed that they are below their maximum allowable limits the predominant ions are so4 2 na and ca2 the order of dominance of the cations and anions is na ca2 k mg2 and so4 2 cl no3 hco3 respectively it was observed that 85 of the groundwater samples are na so4 water 10 are ca so4 water whereas 5 represent mg so4 water 3 the heavy metals distribution in the samples is in the order fe pb zn ni cr zn and cr concentrations were found below their respective standard limits all the hand dug wells were free from heavy metals contamination however 75 of the total samples are fe contaminated 40 are ni contaminated while 50 are pb contaminated 4 based on the pig classification 80 of the water samples have insignificant pollution level and hence are suitable for drinking purposes however 20 of the samples have very high pollution level and are therefore unsuitable for human consumption the samples identified as unsuitable for drinking are those that received the highest anthropogenic input 5 fe zn and cr pose low potential ecological risks however ni poses moderate potential ecological risk to 10 of the samples while pb poses very high ecological risk to 20 of the samples overall the eri revealed that 20 of the samples pose very high ecological risk while 80 pose low ecological risk 6 the hca grouped the analyzed samples into two major clusters first cluster has 80 of water suitable for drinking while second cluster has 20 of water unsuitable for human consumption 7 therefore this research recommends the treatment of contaminated groundwater before human consumption also adequate groundwater protection programs should be adopted as the aquifers are relatively shallow appendix a supplementary data the following is
