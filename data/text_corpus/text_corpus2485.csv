12425,thallium tl is a rare heavy metal with extreme toxicity and tl pollution in water bodies has frequently emerged globally it is a challenge to effectively remove the predominant monovalent thallium from acid wastewater in this study highly efficient tl i removal from aqueous solution was realized through synergetic application of nanowire γ mnooh biochar and free radicals oh and so4 generated via activating persulfate this method exhibited an overall robust tl removal capacity in a wide ph range even can remove over 97 of tl at ph 2 and maintain generally stable in the presence of coexisting ion and organic matter the tl removal capacity at low initial ph of the solution was up to 20 higher than that at alkaline conditions and fast adsorption realized in the first 10 min this study offers a novel alternative of tl bearing wastewater treatment with facilely engineered composite that combines advanced oxidation and adsorption techniques thus potentially serving as a promising method towards tl removal from challenging acid mine drainage graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords thallium tl γ mnooh advanced oxidation biochar data availability all the research data have been included in the manuscript others if any can be available on the request 1 introduction as a typical neurotoxin with strong accumulation ability in human body thallium tl is an extremely toxic element with a lethal dose of 8 12 mg kg 1 2 ingestion of even trace amount of tl can cause serious damage to human organs such as kidney liver bone and blood 3 4 despite its toxicity thallium is an essential strategic resource used in electronic devices semiconductor infrared spectrometers and so on 5 most of tl compounds ubiquitously present in nature are readily soluble to diffuse into the environment through water media eventually threatening human health via drinking water and or the food chain 6 7 in nature tl exists mainly in the form of tl and the ionic radius of tl is similar to that of k and rb which allows tl to exist in potassium feldspar and mica exhibiting lithophilic properties 8 9 moreover 80 of thallium containing ores contain sulfur 10 which reflects the obvious chalcophile property of tl owing to these two geochemical properties tl is widely distributed in many minerals 46 48 the primary source of thallium pollution is mainly from the mining smelting of non ferrous ores containing typical sulfide minerals like pyrite 11 secondary sources are likely to originate from cement production refining of oil fractions and production and use of tl containing compounds 12 13 49 particularly low ph promotes the activation and migration of tl in rock ores thus sulfide and coal mining may significantly increase the concentration of dissolved tl in the hydrosphere in acid mine drainage amd 14 casiot et al 15 reported that tl concentrations amounted to 534 μg l in amd affected rivers downstream of an abandoned mine in france which is five orders of magnitude higher than the values found in natural river water recently approximately 140 kg of dissolved tl load was annually transported from the acidic tinto river in the iberian peninsula to the atlantic ocean 16 all these findings demonstrate that acidic media is the primary matrix where active monovalent tl prominently exist and therefore effective treatment measures are of particular necessity both forms of tl i i e tl and tloh are present in the dissolved state at a wide ph range 0 14 17 tl iii hydroxide has a low solubility in the ph range of 7 9 with the minimum solubility estimated to be well below 0 001 ng l the form of tl iii varies with ph for example tloh2 dominates in the ph range of 2 69 6 36 while tl oh 2 mainly presents in the ph range of 6 36 7 42 at the ph between 7 42 and 8 78 tl oh 3 is more abundant than the other forms of tl iii 17 based on the difference in solubility current thallium removal in water is usually achieved by converting tl i to tl iii thus forming tl oh 3 precipitation after ph adjustment 18 current technologies on removing tl from water mainly include chemical precipitation ion exchange electrochemical separation adsorption and flotation technology etc 19 20 47 the single treatment approach of thallium containing wastewater has inevitable limitations for example activated carbon based adsorption has low adsorption capacities and requires high ph for adsorption ordinary application of persulfate oxidation and subsequent precipitation also needs high operation ph which means higher costs 21 in particular for thallium treatment of amd the amount of chemicals needed to adjust the ph is very large therefore a single method cannot be used for efficient and cost effective removal by combining several methods designing a material to achieve efficient thallium removal over a wide ph range can effectively reduce costs and treatment steps the concept of combining adsorption which is recognized as one of the best methods with oxidation which presents fast kinetics would be of great value in wastewater treatment 50 in this regard advanced oxidation technology based on persulfate would be more efficient stable and cost effective as compared with traditional methods 22 23 if the low reaction ph condition hits the same target persulfate ps is mainly consisted of peroxymonosulfate pms hso5 and peroxydisulfate pds s2o8 2 24 pds activation produces two sulfate radicals so4 while pms activation produces oh and so4 51 ps mainly includes sodium salt potassium salt and ammonium salt compared with ammonium and potassium salts na2s2o8 has the advantages of higher solubility less secondary pollution lower price and easier storage and transportation therefore na2s2o8 has become one of the most used oxidants in advanced oxidation techniques 25 activation of excessive metals e g fe2 ag mn2 co2 etc has various application advantages which does not require external energy supply and can be carried out at room temperature 26 specifically mn oxides are widely used due to their easy synthesis low cost and non toxic properties 21 27 29 studies showed that mn in γ mnooh can be stabilized as a trivalent isomer at room temperature and γ mnooh can effectively remove organic pollutants in wastewater by catalytic persulfate 21 30 since the adsorption performance of γ mnooh is limited biochar can serve as a suitable load carrier due to the advantages of rich functional groups and large specific surface area which can activate ps as well 31 32 52 therefore this study synthesized a novel γ mnooh modified biochar composite to remove tl from wastewater the mechanism of tl removal using this material was explored through a variety of characterization techniques such as scanning electron microscope sem electronic spin resonance esr fourier transform infrared spectrometer ft ir and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps besides the factors affecting tl removal i e the initial and equilibrium ph adsorbent properties ps dosage coexisting ions and coexisting organic matters in this system were analyzed this research may realize the highly efficient removal of tl from acidic wastewater with activated persulfate which poses great prospect in green biomass material synthesis and tl containing wastewater treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of γ mnooh biochar γ mnooh biochar was prepared according to the process previously reported by liu et al 33 briefly 0 1360 g of potassium permanganate and polyethylene glycol were added to 50 ml of deionized water followed by the addition of 1 g pine sawdust biochar which was prepared according to komkiene and baltrenaite 34 subsequently the mixture was put into a stainless steel autoclave for heating at 120 c for 12 h finally the precipitation was washed by cyclic cleaning with deionized water and ethanol which then placed in a vacuum box at 40 c to dry and grind for use 2 2 characterization fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir tensor 27 germany and x ray powder diffraction xrd were used to ensure the successful synthesis of γ mnooh biochar by analyzing its characteristic peaks scanning electron microscope combined with energy dispersive x ray spectrometer sem eds tests were completed to observe the morphological characteristics and elemental distribution of γ mnooh biochar brunauer emmett teller bet was used to determine the change in the size of the biochar before and after loading γ mnooh in addition electronic spin resonance esr and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps thermo scientific k alpha adopting c 1s peak as internal standard calibration peak to identify the functioning radicals and valence states respectively of the reaction system 2 3 batch experiments unless otherwise stated the experimental conditions are set as follows the initial concentration of tl i was set to 10 mg l the dosage of nanowire type γ mnooh biochar was 2 0 g l and the concentration of na2s2o8 was 2 mm the reaction was conducted at 25 c with the initial ph of 3 5 after completing 60 min adsorption 5 ml of suspension was collected through 0 22 μm filter the effects of both the dosage of γ mnooh biochar 0 3 g l and concentration of ps 0 1 4 mm were respectively examined on tl removal the influence of initial ph 2 10 and equilibrium ph 4 10 on tl adsorption capacity of γ mnooh biochar were further investigated in addition the impact of coexisting ions mg2 ca2 cl and organic matter dtpa and edta were investigated all materials and reagents used in this study are of analytical grade ar 99 7 3 results and discussion 3 1 adsorption isotherms of γ mnooh biochar freundlich and langmuir are two widely used adsorption thermodynamic models for describing the adsorption properties of adsorbents 35 36 as shown in fig 1a b and table s1 the experimental data in this research fitted better with the freundlich isothermal adsorption model compared with the langmuir isothermal adsorption model it indicates that the adsorption process primarily occurs in the multi layer interaction between the surface of the synthesized heterogeneous composite and tl 33 37 the γ mnooh biochar may exhibit a significant internal molecular force during tl adsorption the heterogeneity factor n was 1 at different temperatures indicating that the nanowire γ mnooh biochar readily adsorbs tl in a chemical adsorption process 29 31 the k l parameter was 1 which indicated that the adsorption of tl by nanowire γ mnooh biochar ps is spontaneous the adsorption capacities of the synthesized material towards tl at 25 35 and 45 c were 87 98 and 123 mg g respectively 3 2 sorption kinetics the pseudo first order and pseudo second order were adopted to investigate the kinetics of tl sorption on γ mnooh biochar fig 1c d the effect of tl removal was remarkable in 0 10 min at the beginning of the reaction it can be explained by the fact that the adsorbent initially has a high concentration gradient in solution and there are sufficient binding sites on the surface of γ mnooh biochar 38 however as the reaction proceeded the adsorption sites decreased gradually and the reaction rate slowed down after 10 min and reached equilibrium afterwards as displayed in table s2 the pseudo second order kinetic model was more suitable to illustrate the process of removing tl in this study r 2 0 999 it suggests that chemical adsorption occurs in the process of adsorbing tl with γ mnooh biochar 3 3 exploration of influencing factors 3 3 1 effect of ph it has been widely recognized that ph may significantly affect the interaction between pollutants and adsorbents reactants 53 55 59 as shown in fig 2a b nanowire γ mnooh biochar ps system reached maximum tl i removal efficiency at 95 under strong acidic conditions and decreased to 70 in a higher ph when initial ph exceeded 4 the removal rate increased gradually the negative charge on surface of biochar and γ mnooh increased with the rise of ph thereby enhancing the adsorption ability of tl i and improving the removal rate the variation of tl removal rate and effluent concentration with the equilibrium ph increasing showed a similar trend with the initial ph increasing 3 3 2 effect of dosage of adsorbent and ps as displayed in fig 2c when the dosage of γ mnooh biochar increased from 0 1 to 1 5 g l the removal efficiency of tl i improved rapidly but gradually leveled off when the dosage continued to elevate the specific surface area and the hydroxyl functional groups of γ mnooh on biochar increased significantly with the addition of dosage which can provide more adsorption sites and functional groups fig 2d displayed that ps also exerted prominent effect on tl removal thallium removal rate improved rapidly with oxidant dosage increasing from 0 1 to 2 mm however further addition of ps inhibited tl removal this might be due to the fact that γ mnooh activated ps at high concentrations which resulted in the generation of so4 and following consumption of so4 2 through reactions eqs 1 and 2 31 1 s o 4 2 s o 4 s 2 o 8 2 2 s o 4 s 2 o 8 2 s o 4 s 2 o 8 3 3 3 effect of dosage of coexisting ions as shown in fig 3a both the coexisting anions and cations could significantly inhibit tl removal and ca2 displayed the most pronounced inhibitory effect the addition of 1 100 μmol l of mg2 and ca2 reduced almost half of tl removal efficiency it might be explained by the fact that mg2 and ca2 competitively occupied the adsorption sites and significantly affected the tl adsorption efficiency 39 the addition of cl also significantly inhibited tl removal it is because that so4 is susceptible to the influence from anionic species in the water environment due to the reaction of cl and so4 the catalytic activity of so4 is inhibited 39 similar phenomenon occurred in another study on removing tl from water by zero valent iron activated persulfate 31 after the concentration of cl reached 0 5 mol l tl removal reduced from 80 to 25 3 3 4 effect of coexisting organic matter since the organic carbon is a critical factor influencing the environmental behavior of the pollutants in the immediate environment 54 60 the tentative investigation of typical coexisting edta and dtpa was conducted as shown in fig 3b the tl removal efficiency of nanowire γ mnooh biochar decreased continuously after the addition of organic matter the inhibitory effect of dtpa was clearly observed although the concentration of dtpa was only 10 μmol l the removal rate reduced from 95 to 70 the possible reasons are as follows 1 edta and dtpa can react with so4 and inhibit their catalytic oxidation performance 40 41 2 adsorption sites on biochar surface are likely to be occupied by organic matter thereby reducing the non specific adsorption of tl by biochar and nanowire γ mnooh and 3 the organic compounds can chelate or complexate with the tl in solution through their own oxygen containing functional groups to form stable complexes 3 4 material characterization and tl i removal mechanism 3 4 1 xrd analysis the xrd patterns of nanowire γ mnooh biochar before the reaction fig 4 displayed a strong characteristic diffraction peak which indicated good crystallinity of the nanowire γ mnooh on the doped biochar the five characteristic peaks of nanowire γ mnooh biochar can fit the standard card well suggesting that nanowire γ mnooh biochar has been successfully synthesized after the reaction the diffraction peaks of mn3o4 were observed at 2θ 17 9 31 7 36 0 45 4 and 59 8 which were consistent with mn3o4 standard card further analysis using software jade 6 0 showed that the mn3o4 content is about 40 at ph 2 after the reaction while its content is 20 at ph 7 it is likely that mn2 was more easily formed in the catalytic process at low ph and these low valent metal ions were effective in promoting the production of so4 from persulfates in addition oh on the surface played a significant role in the catalytic activation of persulfates by transition metal ions therefore during the catalytic process mn ii plays the main catalytic role in addition to γ mnooh s catalysis of ps to produce so4 3 4 2 ft ir analysis as exhibited in fig 5a the peak detected at 2870 cm 1 was attributed to oh telescopic vibration which is related to the o oh hydrogen bond in γ mnooh the peak at 3430 cm 1 is a tensile combination of oh 42 the peak at 1590 cm 1 corresponds to the cc bond on the original biochar which suggests the biochar before and after modification held with high carbon content as well as an aromatic structure 31 the peaks of 1110 and 1450 cm 1 represent the bending vibrations of γ oh δ 2 oh and δ 1 oh respectively there are some differences in the ft ir spectra of biochar before and after modification where the peaks of γ mnooh biochar were stronger at 529 599 and 951 cm 1 besides the peak at 3430 cm 1 was ascribed to oh telescopic vibrations therefore it can be concluded that γ mnooh biochar has been successfully prepared which corresponds to the results of xrd nevertheless little change was found comparing the characteristic peaks before and after the reaction fig 5b indicating that the structure of nanowire γ mnooh biochar was stable in the process of activating ps to adsorb tl 3 4 3 enhanced sorption of γ mnooh biochar with greatly elevated surface area as shown in fig 5c the n2 sorption isotherm of the composite belonged to type iv with h3 hysteretic cycle it can be observed that the surface area of nanowire γ mnooh biochar 187 03 m2 g was remarkably improved compared to that of the original biochar before modification 6 41 m2 g which is one of most important reasons for the significantly improved tl i removal from the solution 3 4 4 xps analysis as displayed in fig 6a mn 2p peaks included 641 36 640 43 and 643 77 ev which corresponded to mn iii mn ii and part of mn so4 2 respectively 31 43 moreover it could be found that the proportions of mn iii mn ii and part of mn iv were 72 70 10 50 and 16 80 respectively the xps spectra after the reaction fig 6b showed that the distribution of mn valency was not consistent at ph 7 and ph 2 the proportion of mn iii in the xps was significantly less at ph 2 while mn ii and mn iv increased significantly compared with that at ph 7 it is indicated that γ mnooh with elevated oxidation activity can promote the transformation between mn3 and mn2 under strong acid condition in the catalytic cycle mn3 was converted into mn2 and the catalytic efficiency of mn2 was much higher than that of mn3 at the same time mn iv and tl i also react under strong acidic conditions the reaction path is as follows 3 mno 2 tl h h 2 o 2 mn 2 tl oh 3 s in addition it was found that the proportion of tl iii was 16 25 at ph 2 but only 8 38 at ph 7 indicating that persulfate oxidation effect is also stronger under acidic conditions considering the easy oxidation of tl i to tl iii in the natural state the actual proportion of tl iii is likely to be much higher than 16 25 3 4 5 sem eds analysis as displayed in fig 7b a clear long linear γ mnooh was uniformly loaded on the biochar surface it can be observed that the γ mnooh maintained a nanowire structure and thus the cross morphology of γ mnooh on the biochar surface significantly increased the specific surface area of the modified biochar some agglomeration of nanowire γ mnooh biochar occurred after the reaction appearing as particles of different sizes fig 7h j it was found that many globular particles speculated to be tl2o3 were attached to the surface of the biochar similar spherical particles were also observed on the surface of nanowire γ mnooh eds analysis of the materials showed that the ratios of elements were 80 6 of o 12 5 of mn 5 0 of s 1 8 of tl the adsorption capacity of γ mnooh biochar for tl i was significantly enhanced this may be due to the reduced agglomeration of γ mnooh after loading on biochar which provides more active sites for catalyzing ps to produce free radicals in addition it greatly improved the efficiency of oxidizing tl i to tl iii 3 4 6 esr analysis according to the esr analysis fig 8 both methanol ch3oh and tert butanol c4h10o showed significant inhibitory effects on tl i removal ch3oh can easily react with oh and so4 at high reaction rate constant k oh 1 2 2 8 109 ms k so4 1 6 7 7 107 ms 45 the reaction rate constant of c4h10o with oh 3 8 7 6 108 ms is notably higher than that of c4h10o with so4 4 0 9 1 105 ms 44 45 compared with the control group tl removal rate decreased from 95 to 30 40 when 20 mm quenching agent was added therefore it can be inferred that both of so4 and oh played a significant role in oxidative removal of tl since the reaction of oh with ch3oh and c4h10o the oxidation of tl i was inhibited all these results suggested that free radicals played an active part in this process in order to further confirm the role of so4 and oh in the system dmpo was used as a spin trapping agent in the esr experiment to identify the role and species of free radicals in the reaction of nanowire γ mnooh biochar ps as shown in fig 8b four peaks with a large amplitude marked with blue rectangle of 1 2 2 1 was obtained which are attributed to the generation of dmpo oh and signals of 1 1 1 1 1 1 weak peaks marked with red circle belonging to dmpo so4 were also observed 61 62 3 4 7 removal mechanism based on the above results the removal of thallium is a hybrid process involving the activation of ps the oxidation of tl i the cycling of manganese ions and adsorption fig 9 mn3 can react with ps to produce mn2 and so4 the resulting mn2 can combine with water to produce the highly reactive mnoh which continues to catalyze ps to produce so4 and mno thus the activation process also completes the cycle from mn iii to mn ii and back to mn iii the tl i in the water is oxidized by so4 oh and s2o8 2 to tl iii and then adsorbed by biochar the reaction will proceed according to the following equation i the activation of ps 4 mn 3 s 2 o 8 2 h 2 o s o 5 mn 2 so 4 2 2 h 5 mn 3 s o 4 2 s o 4 mn 2 ii the cycling of manganese ions 6 mn 2 h 2

tl 2 oh tl 3 2 oh 4 conclusion this work reported a synthesized green carbon based composite i e γ mnooh biochar that may deserve wide applications the novel composite combined with the use of persulfate not only achieved efficient removal of tl from synthetic wastewater but also the adsorbed tl provides raw material for tl resource recycling showing great benefits for both cleaner production and environmental remediation the removal of tl i from wastewater by composite conforms well to the freundlich isothermal adsorption model and the pseudo second order model it also exhibited special advantage in omitting the procedure of adjusting the equilibrium ph during the removal process and efficient removal of tl i from the wastewater can be achieved over a wide ph range especially the removal efficiency of tl can reach 97 at remarkably low ph ph 2 electronic spin resonance esr indicated the oh and so4 played a critical role in the process of tl removal due to the loading on biochar γ mnooh provides more active sites and the agglomeration can be effectively avoided all these findings highlight that the γ mnooh biochar composite may deserve promising

increased with the rise of ph thereby enhancing the adsorption ability of tl i and improving the removal rate the variation of tl removal rate and effluent concentration with the equilibrium ph increasing showed a similar trend with the initial ph increasing 3 3 2 effect of dosage of adsorbent and ps as displayed in fig 2c when the dosage of γ mnooh biochar increased from 0 1 to 1 5 g l the removal efficiency of tl i improved rapidly but gradually leveled off when the dosage continued to elevate the specific surface area and the hydroxyl functional groups of γ mnooh on biochar increased significantly with the addition of dosage which can provide more adsorption sites and functional groups fig 2d displayed that ps also exerted prominent effect on tl removal thallium removal rate improved rapidly with oxidant dosage increasing from 0 1 to 2 mm however further addition of ps inhibited tl removal this might be due to the fact that γ mnooh activated ps at high concentrations which resulted in the generation of so4 and following consumption of so4 2 through reactions eqs 1 and 2 31 1 s o 4 2 s o 4 s 2 o 8 2 2 s o 4 s 2 o 8 2 s o 4 s 2 o 8 3 3 3 effect of dosage of coexisting ions as shown in fig 3a both the coexisting anions and cations could significantly inhibit tl removal and ca2 displayed the most pronounced inhibitory effect the addition of 1 100 μmol l of mg2 and ca2 reduced almost half of tl removal efficiency it might be explained by the fact that mg2 and ca2 competitively occupied the adsorption sites and significantly affected the tl adsorption efficiency 39 the addition of cl also significantly inhibited tl removal it is because that so4 is susceptible to the influence from anionic species in the water environment due to the reaction of cl and so4 the catalytic activity of so4 is inhibited 39 similar phenomenon occurred in another study on removing tl from water by zero valent iron activated persulfate 31 after the concentration of cl reached 0 5 mol l tl removal reduced from 80 to 25 3 3 4 effect of coexisting organic matter since the organic carbon is a critical factor influencing the environmental behavior of the pollutants in the immediate environment 54 60 the tentative investigation of typical coexisting edta and dtpa was conducted as shown in fig 3b the tl removal efficiency of nanowire γ mnooh biochar decreased continuously after the addition of organic matter the inhibitory effect of dtpa was clearly observed although the concentration of dtpa was only 10 μmol l the removal rate reduced from 95 to 70 the possible reasons are as follows 1 edta and dtpa can react with so4 and inhibit their catalytic oxidation performance 40 41 2 adsorption sites on biochar surface are likely to be occupied by organic matter thereby reducing the non specific adsorption of tl by biochar and nanowire γ mnooh and 3 the organic compounds can chelate or complexate with the tl in solution through their own oxygen containing functional groups to form stable complexes 3 4 material characterization and tl i removal mechanism 3 4 1 xrd analysis the xrd patterns of nanowire γ mnooh biochar before the reaction fig 4 displayed a strong characteristic diffraction peak which indicated good crystallinity of the nanowire γ mnooh on the doped biochar the five characteristic peaks of nanowire γ mnooh biochar can fit the standard card well suggesting that nanowire γ mnooh biochar has been successfully synthesized after the reaction the diffraction peaks of mn3o4 were observed at 2θ 17 9 31 7 36 0 45 4 and 59 8 which were consistent with mn3o4 standard card further analysis using software jade 6 0 showed that the mn3o4 content is about 40 at ph 2 after the reaction while its content is 20 at ph 7 it is likely that mn2 was more easily formed in the catalytic process at low ph and these low valent metal ions were effective in promoting the production of so4 from persulfates in addition oh on the surface played a significant role in the catalytic activation of persulfates by transition metal ions therefore during the catalytic process mn ii plays the main catalytic role in addition to γ mnooh s catalysis of ps to produce so4 3 4 2 ft ir analysis as exhibited in fig 5a the peak detected at 2870 cm 1 was attributed to oh telescopic vibration which is related to the o oh hydrogen bond in γ mnooh the peak at 3430 cm 1 is a tensile combination of oh 42 the peak at 1590 cm 1 corresponds to the cc bond on the original biochar which suggests the biochar before and after modification held with high carbon content as well as an aromatic structure 31 the peaks of 1110 and 1450 cm 1 represent the bending vibrations of γ oh δ 2 oh and δ 1 oh respectively there are some differences in the ft ir spectra of biochar before and after modification where the peaks of γ mnooh biochar were stronger at 529 599 and 951 cm 1 besides the peak at 3430 cm 1 was ascribed to oh telescopic vibrations therefore it can be concluded that γ mnooh biochar has been successfully prepared which corresponds to the results of xrd nevertheless little change was found comparing the characteristic peaks before and after the reaction fig 5b indicating that the structure of nanowire γ mnooh biochar was stable in the process of activating ps to adsorb tl 3 4 3 enhanced sorption of γ mnooh biochar with greatly elevated surface area as shown in fig 5c the n2 sorption isotherm of the composite belonged to type iv with h3 hysteretic cycle it can be observed that the surface area of nanowire γ mnooh biochar 187 03 m2 g was remarkably improved compared to that of the original biochar before modification 6 41 m2 g which is one of most important reasons for the significantly improved tl i removal from the solution 3 4 4 xps analysis as displayed in fig 6a mn 2p peaks included 641 36 640 43 and 643 77 ev which corresponded to mn iii mn ii and part of mn so4 2 respectively 31 43 moreover it could be found that the proportions of mn iii mn ii and part of mn iv were 72 70 10 50 and 16 80 respectively the xps spectra after the reaction fig 6b showed that the distribution of mn valency was not consistent at ph 7 and ph 2 the proportion of mn iii in the xps was significantly less at ph 2 while mn ii and mn iv increased significantly compared with that at ph 7 it is indicated that γ mnooh with elevated oxidation activity can promote the transformation between mn3 and mn2 under strong acid condition in the catalytic cycle mn3 was converted into mn2 and the catalytic efficiency of mn2 was much higher than that of mn3 at the same time mn iv and tl i also react under strong acidic conditions the reaction path is as follows 3 mno 2 tl h h 2 o 2 mn 2 tl oh 3 s in addition it was found that the proportion of tl iii was 16 25 at ph 2 but only 8 38 at ph 7 indicating that persulfate oxidation effect is also stronger under acidic conditions considering the easy oxidation of tl i to tl iii in the natural state the actual proportion of tl iii is likely to be much higher than 16 25 3 4 5 sem eds analysis as displayed in fig 7b a clear long linear γ mnooh was uniformly loaded on the biochar surface it can be observed that the γ mnooh maintained a nanowire structure and thus the cross morphology of γ mnooh on the biochar surface significantly increased the specific surface area of the modified biochar some agglomeration of nanowire γ mnooh biochar occurred after the reaction appearing as particles of different sizes fig 7h j it was found that many globular particles speculated to be tl2o3 were attached to the surface of the biochar similar spherical particles were also observed on the surface of nanowire γ mnooh eds analysis of the materials showed that the ratios of elements were 80 6 of o 12 5 of mn 5 0 of s 1 8 of tl the adsorption capacity of γ mnooh biochar for tl i was significantly enhanced this may be due to the reduced agglomeration of γ mnooh after loading on biochar which provides more active sites for catalyzing ps to produce free radicals in addition it greatly improved the efficiency of oxidizing tl i to tl iii 3 4 6 esr analysis according to the esr analysis fig 8 both methanol ch3oh and tert butanol c4h10o showed significant inhibitory effects on tl i removal ch3oh can easily react with oh and so4 at high reaction rate constant k oh 1 2 2 8 109 ms k so4 1 6 7 7 107 ms 45 the reaction rate constant of c4h10o with oh 3 8 7 6 108 ms is notably higher than that of c4h10o with so4 4 0 9 1 105 ms 44 45 compared with the control group tl removal rate decreased from 95 to 30 40 when 20 mm quenching agent was added therefore it can be inferred that both of so4 and oh played a significant role in oxidative removal of tl since the reaction of oh with ch3oh and c4h10o the oxidation of tl i was inhibited all these results suggested that free radicals played an active part in this process in order to further confirm the role of so4 and oh in the system dmpo was used as a spin trapping agent in the esr experiment to identify the role and species of free radicals in the reaction of nanowire γ mnooh biochar ps as shown in fig 8b four peaks with a large amplitude marked with blue rectangle of 1 2 2 1 was obtained which are attributed to the generation of dmpo oh and signals of 1 1 1 1 1 1 weak peaks marked with red circle belonging to dmpo so4 were also observed 61 62 3 4 7 removal mechanism based on the above results the removal of thallium is a hybrid process involving the activation of ps the oxidation of tl i the cycling of manganese ions and adsorption fig 9 mn3 can react with ps to produce mn2 and so4 the resulting mn2 can combine with water to produce the highly reactive mnoh which continues to catalyze ps to produce so4 and mno thus the activation process also completes the cycle from mn iii to mn ii and back to mn iii the tl i in the water is oxidized by so4 oh and s2o8 2 to tl iii and then adsorbed by biochar the reaction will proceed according to the following equation i the activation of ps 4 mn 3 s 2 o 8 2 h 2 o s o 5 mn 2 so 4 2 2 h 5 mn 3 s o 4 2 s o 4 mn 2 ii the cycling of manganese ions 6 mn 2 h 2

tl 2 oh tl 3 2 oh 4 conclusion this work reported a synthesized green carbon based composite i e γ mnooh biochar that may deserve wide applications the novel composite combined with the use of persulfate not only achieved efficient removal of tl from synthetic wastewater but also the adsorbed tl provides raw material for tl resource recycling showing great benefits for both cleaner production and environmental remediation the removal of tl i from wastewater by composite conforms well to the freundlich isothermal adsorption model and the pseudo second order model it also exhibited special advantage in omitting the procedure of adjusting the equilibrium ph during the removal process and efficient removal of tl i from the wastewater can be achieved over a wide ph range especially the removal efficiency of tl can reach 97 at remarkably low ph ph 2 electronic spin resonance esr indicated the oh and so4 played a critical role in the process of tl removal due to the loading on biochar γ mnooh provides more active sites and the agglomeration can be effectively avoided all these findings highlight that the γ mnooh biochar composite may deserve promising

12426,an indigenous bacterial strain bacillus sp my156 was isolated from a local wastewater treatment plant and utilized for degradation of dibutyl phthalate dbp and diethyl phthalate dep the isolate showed a substrate preference of dbp to dep the optimal biodegradation conditions were ph 7 30 c 0 2 in terms of od600 inoculum size and 2 v v 1 bacterial load the biodegradation of dbp and dep as sole carbon source was comprehensively investigated via degradation kinetics and mass balance analysis the isolate achieved complete degradation and over 80 removal of 300 mg l 1 dbp within 60 h and 200 mg l 1 dep in 5 days the biodegradation of dbp and dep fitted the inhibitory kinetic model and the maximum degradation rates for dbp and dep were 183 34 and 66 90 mg l 1 day 1 respectively the cell surface responses to biodegradation were investigated by analyses of morphology fourier transform infrared and extracellular polymeric substance the potential intermediates were mono n butyl phthalate mono ethyl phthalate phthalic acid and protocatechuic acid by β oxidation hydrolysis and decarboxylation the esterase and dehydrogenase activities reached the highest at the initial and middle phases during biodegradation the docking studies also elucidated the relevant enzyme preferred dbp to dep via binding energy and bond distance graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords dibutyl phthalate diethyl phthalate biodegradation stoichiometry esterase data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction phthalic acid esters paes are widely utilized in commercial and industrial fields due to their characteristics of enhancing flexibility and durability of the polymer 1 2 because of the specialty in physical bond to polymer metric paes can be released slowly to the environment when producing applying and disposing the host polymers and leading potential risk to the environment 3 as a consequence paes are ubiquitous and easily detected in many natural environments such as wastewater seawater soil sediment and even vegetables 4 dibutyl phthalate dbp and diethyl phthalate dep are among the most abundant common paes occurring in the environment and exert the toxic risks of inducing mutagen and carcinoma causing accumulative worries to human life via daily nutrient intake 5 hence they have been categorized as critical pollutants by various countries and organizations such as china national environmental monitoring center environmental protection agency of the united states and the european union 3 dbp and dep in environment are generally degraded as results of hydrolytic action photolysis and biological degradation however their natural degradation occurs extremely slowly with potential for producing even more toxic byproducts thus biodegradation is recognized as a highly effective strategy for the paes contamination due to its economic and environmentally friendly properties during the removal process 3 6 various bacteria such as acinetobacter rhodococcus agrobacterium pseudomonas sphingobium providencia gordonia and bacillus sp have been reported efficiently degrading dbp and dep 7 9 since the paes exist concurrently in natural environments including wastewater treatment plants further understanding toward bacterial degrading availability for the pae contaminants existing in mixture is increasingly important 10 12 in general due to the structural complexity and recalcitrance long side chains paes such as dehp and dnop have been reported more difficult to be decomposed compared to short side chains phthalates such as dbp and dep 9 acinetobacter sp jdc 16 could attain complete degradation of 500 mg l 1 dep within 20 h at ph 8 and 35 c 13 while acinetobacter sp sn13 needed 5 days to degrade nearly 90 of 400 mg l 1 dehp 7 it has also been reported some bacteria showed preferential degradation rates when dealing with phthalates with longer alkyl chains quan et al 14 reported bacillus subtilis no 66 demonstrated strong ability in degrading dehp while it could hardly degrade dbp and dep zhang et al 15 discovered the degrading ability of bacillus mojavensis b1811 toward seven paes showing complete degradation of 500 mg l 1 dehp dbp bbp and dpp within 4 days whereas the phthalates with shortest alkyl chain like dmp only exhibited 5 9 degradation enzyme activity could be identified as a breakthrough for this unclear issue since it is in connection with the generation of interspace diffuse resistance via lateral chains instead of the length of side chains 16 many also reported the hydrolysis of ester bond played a key role in determining the degradation rate 2 6 17 furthermore together with hydrolases mainly esterase oxygenases are the enzymes involved in the paes biodegradation 18 consequently considering hydrolase together with oxygenases is vital for a deeper analysis of the microbial degradation mechanism for phthalates however there is still rare information about the interaction mechanisms of paes especially toward hydrolase the main enzyme involved during pae biodegradation and the information on esterase another important enzyme involved has been little 19 20 therefore this study aimed to enhance the understanding of interaction performances and the mechanisms behind during the concurrent biodegradation of common phthalate esters contaminants the indigenous bacillus sp my156 isolated from the local activated sludge was employed to degrade dbp and dep the biodegradation characteristics including degradation kinetics and mass balance analysis were assessed together with analysis of enzyme activity and response to cell surface and the interaction mechanisms between biodegradation of dbp and dep by the isolate were also explored 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals dbp and dep were of analytical grades purities up to 99 5 and purchased from aladdin methanol and hexane were of chromatographic grades other reagents

dissolved in methanol to prepare 10 g l 1 stock solutions in order to obtain pae as the only carbon source pae was added in serum bottles and put in fume hood for complete volatilization of methanol before used 23 tween 80 2 4 g l 1 was added to enhance the solubility of pae the strain was cultured in luria bertani lb medium which contained peptone 10 g l 1 nacl 10 g l 1 and yeast extract 5 g l 1 then the cultured bacterial suspension was under centrifugation 4000 rpm 10 min and washed with 0 01 m phosphoric acid buffer pbs ph 7 4 thrice 2 3 biodegradation of dbp and dep 2 3 1 effects of substrate concentration ph and temperature the seed culture 2 v v 1 was inoculated into serum bottles containing 50 ml bsm and different concentrations 50 500 mg l 1 of dbp or dep as growth substrate then the bottles were incubated at 30 0 5 c and 150 rpm in the dark one milliliter aliquots were collected at 12 h and 24 h intervals for dbp and dep respectively for the effects of ph and temperature the isolate was inoculated into bsm containing 100 mg l 1 of dbp and or dep at different phs 4 10 and temperatures 25 30 and 40 c and the samples were taken each day the interaction between dbp and dep in the mixture was evaluated at 300 mg l 1 dbp and 100 mg l 1 dep respectively the degradation efficiencies for dbp and dep singly or in mixture were calculated using the following equation 24 total degradation efficiency 100 c i c f c i where ci and cf represent the initial and final concentrations of dbp or dep respectively the cell growth was measured as od600 2 3 2 biodegradation

concentration of the substrate dbp or dep ks mg l 1 and ki mg l 1 represent half saturation constant and inhibition constant respectively 2 3 3 mass balance and stoichiometric analysis according to shuler and kargi 26 a general treatment mechanism for stoichiometry and mass balance within biological conversion for organic matter is shown as follows chmon ao2 bnh3 ccαhβoγnδ dh2o eco2 3 4 yield biomass substrate x x 0 s 0 s where x and x0 mg l 1 dry cell weight represent the biomass concentration at the end and beginning of reaction respectively and s and s0 mg l 1 represent the final and initial substrate concentration respectively from these equations mass balance on each element and biomass yield from dbp and dep as single substrate were obtained 2 4 removal mechanisms for dbp and

complete separation of aqueous fraction and organic phase the organic phase supernatant was collected to measure the concentration of dbp and dep adsorbed on the cell surface the residual cell pellets

milliliter aliquot was collected and centrifuged 10 000 rpm 5 min during biodegradation of each pae the supernatants were recovered as crude enzyme solutions and 0 2 ml was added in the reaction

added to extract the product the dehydrogenase activity was measured as a485 33 2 6 physical response to biodegradation of dbp and dep after the bacterial cell pellets were collected via

isolate during biodegradation of paes via scanning electron microscopy hitachi su8020 the extracellular polymeric substance analysis was similar to our previous study 21 2 7 bioaugmentation with synthetic pae contaminated marine water samples marine water samples were collected from the intertidal of hac sa bay macau special administrative region china the cultured seed was inoculated in glass serum bottles 2 v v 1 containing 50 ml of marine water pretreated with 100 mg l 1 of dbp and or dep seawater containing same concentration of pae without inoculation was set as control group the reaction conditions were same as the above treatment 2 8 chemical analysis and identification of the proposed metabolites the tested samples were first centrifugated 12 000 rpm 10 min and filtered via 0 22 μm membrane filters millipore before further measurements the concentrations of dbp and dep were analyzed by a dionex ultimate 3000 hplc thermo scientific u s a equipped with acclaimtm c18 reversed phase column 5 mm 4 6 150 mm and dionex ultimate 3000 diode array detector hplc dad the injection volume and uv wavelength were 80 μl and 196 nm respectively the flow rate and oven temperature were 0 8 ml min 1 and 35 c respectively the mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile a and deionized water b ph adjusted to 3 by formic acid the gradient elution of dbp and dep was carried

25 μm 0 25 mm 30 m samples were extracted by n hexane with sequential treatments vortex sonication and centrifugation the supernatant was recovered and filtered through 0 22 μm membrane the recovery efficiencies for these paes were both above 95 2 9 molecule docking analysis the properties and performance of hydrolase were estimated via docking between paes and the relevant monoesters and enzyme through the autodock vina tools the structures of dbp dep mbp and mep were found in pubchem compound database 34 the minimum binding energy scores were chosen via pymol 35 and the visualization was performed through the discovery studio 2 10 statistical analysis all the treatments were carried out in triplicates the graphpad prism 9 4 was applied for the significance analysis and origin 2019b and graphpad prism 9 4 were utilized for generation of the diagrams 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of different conditions on dbp and dep biodegradation the aerobic biodegradation of paes is reported being influenced by several environmental factors such as temperature ph inoculum size oxygen amount initial concentration of pae as substrate and nutrient availability 3 these factors mainly influence the cellular activity of microorganisms as well as the enzymatic activities and the level of dbp and dep biodegradation is reported extensively subject to the optimization of environmental conditions 6 figs 1 2 a and 2 d show the effects of such different factors as inoculum size bacterial load co cultivation utilizing mixture of dbp and dep initial ph and temperature and initial concentration of dbp and dep on the biodegradation efficiencies for the isolate my156 the removal efficiencies for dbp and dep increased when the inoculum size increased from 0 2 to 0 6 in terms of od600 while the efficiency did not increase with the inoculum size increased from 0 6 to 1 0 therefore the optimal inoculum size was considered 0 6 od600 the increasing bacterial load from 1 to 10 v v 1 also increased the biodegradation of dbp and dep the isolate showed strong dbp degrading abilities at various bacterial loads while with strong dep degrading abilities at low and high bacterial loads only thus the optimal bacterial load for the highest degradation of both paes was considered 2 on the other hand the alkaline condition ph 6 9 was more favorable for the biodegradation of dbp while the dep biodegradation was affected more by the ph value the removal efficiency was the highest at ph 7 for dbp 99 93 and dep 74 42 in case of temperature the isolate showed a higher removal efficiency 98 83 for dbp at 40 c compared to 25 c with the removal efficiency of 63 60 in comparison the isolate was not affected by temperature for the removal of dep showing 43 15 and 49 62 removal efficiencies at 25 and 40 c respectively therefore the optimal temperature for dbp and dep degradation by the isolate was considered 30 c 3 2 interaction mechanisms for and effects of binary dbp and dep biodegradation although there have been many findings related to the pae degrading bacteria it is still important to know the degradation ability of pure culture toward different types of paes considering paes as contaminants generally co existing in the real environments 5 24 36 the microbial removal processes for organic matter such as sorption degradation and accumulation would also contribute to the co pollution 37 therefore the interactive effects of dbp and dep on strain my156 characteristics and removal efficiencies were further explored from their co existence under different conditions mainly ph and temperature in current study in terms of the interaction mechanisms during dbp and dep degradation under various experimental conditions the performance for the binary mixture biodegradation of dbp and dep at different phs and temperatures is shown in figs 1 c f based on the comparison of the removal efficiencies for dbp and dep in the mixture the addition of dbp showed resulting in the stimulatory effect on dep degradation by the isolate there were 18 53 more degradation of dep while the extra dep resulted in a slightly inhibitory effect on dbp degradation showing 0 07 less degradation of dbp under the optimal conditions fig 1c for the effect of ph on binary degradation the addition of dep inhibited dbp biodegradation at acidic phs 4 7 while it stimulated the removal of dbp at alkaline phs fig 1d however the addition of dbp significantly enhanced the dep biodegradation regardless of acidic or alkaline conditions fig 1e this might be due to the increase of hydroxyl ion concentration leading to the difference of the hydrolase activity and substances binding 38 while there might be extra acid intermediates produced from dep biodegradation resulting in decrease of the dbp degradation under acid conditions 39 in case of temperature the addition of dep stimulated dbp biodegradation at lower temperature 33 02 of dbp were further removed at 25 c while the additional dbp stimulated dep biodegradation at higher temperature 29 30 of dep were further removed at 30 c at high temperature the results showed a slightly inhibitory effect when other pae was added showing 5 63 less degradation of dbp and 1 40 less degradation of dep in the mixture treatments respectively fig 1f it is likely resulted from the stimulation of heat stable enzymes from strain my156 to produce additional surfactant at high temperature which could enhance the solubility of paes 40 in case of the multi factor analysis of variance apart from bacterial load and co cultivation with dep other experimental factors such as ph temperature initial substrate concentration and inoculum size significantly affected the dbp degradation by isolate my156 while all the aforementioned factors significantly affected the dep biodegradation the isolate showed the highest removal efficiency at ph 7 for dbp completely removed and dep 74 41 removed in addition the isolate removed more dbp under alkaline conditions from one way analysis of variance anova results further implying the isolate with a significantly strong tolerance to alkaline conditions on the other hand the isolate showed the degradability for dbp and dep over a wide range of temperature including biodegradation of dbp at high temperature further implying these conditions allowing heat resistant enzymes to perform high catalytic activities during biodegradation 39 the isolate bacillus sp my156 removed substrates dbp and dep simultaneously under the co existence condition but with different removal efficiencies fig 1 in mixture dbp was removed almost 100 while dep removed as high as over 90 at ph 7 figs 1d e therefore the isolate showed a substrate preference dbp over dep these results would further imply a potential to choose a more suitable microorganism for the highly efficient removal of paes mixture co existence of dbp and dep also stimulated the mixture biodegradation under alkaline conditions fig 1d it may be due to the additional pae leading to the change of lower ph caused by such intermediates as pa and co2 subsequently providing more alkaline conditions suitable for the strain growth 40 3 3 biodegradation kinetics the isolate degraded various initial concentrations 50 500 mg l 1 of dbp and dep as shown in fig 2 for dbp there was no obvious lag phase in terms of biodegradation regardless of the initial concentration including almost complete removal of dbp at 300 mg l 1 within 3 days fig 2a the removal efficiency for 500 mg l 1 dbp was over 94 7 within 5 days for dep in comparison after a short lag phase the biodegradation increased over time up to the removal efficiency of 80 39 for 200 mg l 1 dep within 5 days fig 2d compared to other previously reported dbp and or dep degrading bacteria the isolate showed a competitive degradation ability for dbp showing complete removal in 60 h relatively shorter at the initial concentration of 300 mg l 1 while showing slower removal efficiencies for dep table 3 in comparison gordonia alkanivorans strain yc rl2 and paracoccus kondratievae strain bjq0001 showed the higher degradation abilities toward paes with shorter side chains 2 41 in general the paes degradability of microorganisms is considered dependent on their length of side chains and molecular weights mw 6 7 dbp has a higher mw 278 40 and longer side chains compared to dep mw 222 08 the dbp and dep degrading isolate bacillus sp my156 in current study was previously reported efficiently degrading dehp 21 some previous studies also reported bacillus spp with degradation abilities toward paes including dbp dep dmp bbp dehp etc with competitive removal efficiencies 15 21 42 44 the degradation ability of bacillus sp my156 toward dbp and dep was similar to bacillus mojavensis b1811 and rhodococcus sp 2g which also showed a faster degradation of dbp than dep 13 45 the biodegradation of paes with different lengths of side chains is also reported dependent on the extremely specific characteristics and activities of enzymes playing key roles in pae hydrolysis 15 figs 2 b c and figs 2 e f show the comparison between simulated and experimentally obtained results of cell growth measured as od600 and degradation rates for different initial concentrations of dbp and dep utilized as sole growth substrate the biodegradation kinetics parameters of dm maximum degradation rate μm maximum specific growth rate ks half saturation constant and ki inhibition constant for haldane s inhibition kinetics are further summarized in table 1 for both dbp and dep the biodegradation kinetics clearly showed the inhibition for both cell growth and degradation except the growth on dep up to 300 mg l 1 figs 2b c e f the highest biodegradation rates for dbp and dep were at the initial concentrations of 500 and 200 mg l 1 respectively and the degradation rate began to decrease when the concentrations were higher the cell growth was also in accordance with the degradation rate for dep showing the highest at 200 mg l 1 while for dbp the highest cell growth was observed at 400 mg l 1 the degradation ability of strain my156 toward dbp and dep as single growth substrate showed similar kinetics which fitted well to the inhibition model while with totally different biodegradation rates for each pae fig 2 and table 1 the exploration of biodegradation kinetics over a wide range of substrate concentrations was beneficial to comprehend the biodegradation characteristics of the isolate toward paes in addition the estimation of biodegradation kinetics parameters especially for high concentrations of substrate is important to completely understand the bacterial degradation properties 2 in current study as the concentrations of dbp and dep increased to 500 and 200 mg l 1 respectively the biodegradation rate decreased further implying less applicability of the isolate for bioaugmentation of the environment heavily contaminated with dbp and dep 3 4 mass balance and stoichiometry in general the organic contaminant uptake by active cells involves three phases the first stage is quick adsorption bioaccumulation through the cell wall and membrane occurs in the second step 46 at the final phase contaminants are decomposed by enzymatic activities 47 as shown in table 2 the main removal mechanisms for dbp and dep at 100 mg l 1 each were biodegradation with 99 51 and 72 01 removal efficiencies for dbp and dep respectively after 5 days of cultivation in comparison the amounts of dbp and dep sorbed to the cell surface were 0 28 and 1 79 respectively and the bioaccumulated amount was less with 0 21 and 0 31 for dbp and dep respectively the mass balance analysis considered biomass value dissolved oxygen do concentration and dbp dep concentration in current study at the beginning of cultivation the do level of the culture was 7 85 mg l 1 on average used for the aerobic biodegradation of dbp and dep as sole growth substrate as well as the aerobic growth of the isolate the level of chemical oxygen demand cod was also examined and the result showed over 95 of cod were removed by the isolate data not shown the stoichiometry analysis for dbp and dep degradation and cell growth was based on the dry weight of biomass 48 using the general biomass formula of c5h7o2n there were 1 1 5 and 3 3 5 of carbons from dbp and dep converted to biomass respectively therefore the stoichiometric equations were as follows 6 for dbp c 16 h 22 o 4 ao 2 bnh 3 cc 5 h 7 o 2 n dh 2 o eco 2 substrate biomass 7 for dep c 12 h 14 o 4 ao 2 bnh 3 cc 5 h 7 o 2 n dh 2 o eco 2 substrate biomass in current study ammonia was identified as the form of ammonium nitrate from bsm during the nitrogen mass balance based on the aforementioned information the following equations represented for c h n and o elements balance unlabelled table dbp dep c balance 16 5c e c balance 12 5c e h balance 22 3b 7c 2d h balance 14 3b 7c 2d o balance 4 2a 2c d 2e o balance 4 2a 2c d 2e n balance b c n balance b c from the above equations the following stoichiometric equations for dbp and dep biodegradation were derived 8 for dbp c 16 h 22 o 4 15 98 o 2 0 70 nh 3 0 70 c 5 h 7 o 2 n 9 59 h 2 o 12 48 co 2 9 for dep c 12 h 14 o 4 5 58 o 2 1 58 nh 3 1

comparable with kumar et al 49 who reported 0 37 and 0 35 for dbp biodegradation by comamonas sp and pseudomonas sp on the other hand the low bioadsorption and bioaccumulation ability of the isolate toward dbp and dep table 2 may be due to their properties having non covalent bonds with other substances present 4 3 5 enzyme activity assay figs 4 b d show the activities of enzymes dbp and dep hydrolase esterase and dehydrogenase during biodegradation of single and binary paes the results from the dbp and dep hydrolase activity fig 4b suggested the addition of dep resulted in a slightly inhibitory effect on dbp degradation p 0 0 05 while the extra dbp would increase the dep hydrolase activity 1 44 more residual activity of dep hydrolase was present in the mixture groups the esterase activities in three different treatments reached the highest after 24 h showing the higher activity when dbp was as sole substrate compared to when dep as sole substrate or dbp dep present as dual substrates figs 4c and s2a in comparison there was no significant difference between dehydrogenase activities among three groups figs 4d and s2b and the highest activities were observed in the mid to late stages of cultivation between 48 and 72 h the dehydrogenase activities were higher when dbp was present as single substrate or dual substrates with dep compared to when dep was single substrate biodegradation of hydrophobic organic pollutants by bacteria is generally possible due to hydrolytic actions and oxidization enzyme reactions mediated by hydrolase and oxidoreductase respectively among those enzymes esterase is the most principal hydrolase utilized in bioremediation contributing to the catalysis of water incorporated with substrate via the aliphatic nucleophilic substitution 50 esterase also plays an essential role in biodegradation of paes via hydrolysis to the corresponding monoesters phthalates 18 results showed the phthalate ester compound with long side chains e g dbp was degraded more than the compound with short side chains e g dep further suggesting more effective degradability toward dbp compared to dep for the isolate another vital enzymes involved in the paes biodegradation are oxidoreductases including dehydrogenases oxygenases and hemeperoxidases contributing to catalyze redox reactions where transfer of electrons or hydrogen and oxygen atoms to substrates occurs 51 dehydrogenases also act significantly for the oxidization of organic contaminants and are responsible for the comprehensive metabolic activities of microorganisms therefore for further assessment of mechanisms and performances of paes biodegradation current study also investigated the dehydrogenases values and found dbp and dep would stimulate the dehydrogenase activity as well as serving as growth substrates 52 on the other hand considering the esterase activity as a key sign for the catalysis function the addition of dep exerted an inhibitory effect on the esterase activity for the dbp biodegradation while the additional dbp showed no apparent effect on the functional groups involving dep the result also showed the inhibitory effect attributed by dep is observed mainly at the initial hydrolysis step 3 6 cell surface characteristics 3 6 1 extracellular polymeric substance eps the concentrations of eps polysaccharide and protein during biodegradation of dbp and dep present singly and in mixture are shown figs 3 a and s1 when dbp and dep were degraded singly the highest concentration of eps secreted was observed in 72 h when the isolate grew to maturity and the cell surface severely damaged by dep and the intermediate products from dbp in comparison when two paes were degraded in mixture the isolate did not show any obvious difference compared to the results from the single substrate cultivation in terms of the concentration of eps secreted p 0 05 since eps is a secretion produced by the normal physiological process of microorganisms it can form a protective layer of cells when the environmental condition changes the self protection and survival mechanism of microorganisms will play an essential role causing the fluctuation of eps secretion of microorganisms 52 the concentration of eps shows the mixture of dbp and dep might protect the cell structure more compared to dep only fig 3a 3 6 2 ft ir analysis bioavailability also has a vital effect on the biodegradation process the ft ir spectra showed both paes with the functional groups affected during biodegradation of dbp and dep singly and in mixture they further showed the peaks appeared concentrated implying more complex substances were produced on the cell surface of the strain compared to its cultivation on glucose fig 3b the spectra between three different groups dbp alone dep alone and dbp dep mixture are mostly different at the wave numbers from 1455 53 to 1636 29 cm 1 which represented varieties of ch2 ch3 aromatic rings and amide groups 47 showing the apparent complexity of functional groups in addition to the shift of functional groups related to the π π eda effect 53 no obvious offset was detected in single pae and binary pae absorption apart from the peak at 517 84 cm 1 in dbp and 517 62 cm 1 in dep shifting to 525 75 cm 1 in the mixture of dbp and dep similarly this phenomenon appeared at 1057 19 cm 1 in dbp and 1059 45 cm 1 in dep shifted to the peak at 1064 30 cm 1 when the compounds co existed zhang et al 47 assigned this region to p o c bonding in rna another offset region appeared at approximately 1057 cm 1 for single pae dbp shifted to the peak at 1064 30 cm 1 in mixture with dep this was attributed to amide bonds occurred between amino group and carboxyl group from the biodegradation intermediates 54 luo et al 46 reported the ch2 groups and protein in the cell walls might also be involved in dbp adsorption considering alkanes and amide were reported also involved in the biological sorption of chromium 55 the additional dbp or dep in mixture might influence the bio sorption process for the originally existing pae by the interaction between functional groups and cell surface 3 6 3 micro morphological analysis the scanning electron micrographs for the isolate after different treatments when dbp and dep were utilized as substrates solely and in mixture are shown in figs 3 c f the sem analysis suggested strain my156 is long rod shaped with complete smooth structure fig 3c after adding dbp the cell surface edge was clear and the shape remained as a long column with several apparent holes appeared at the cell surface fig 3d in comparison however the cell surface became wrinkled and the structures of some cells even disappeared in the dep treatment fig 3e the sem results figs 3c f showed the high concentrations of dbp and dep would lead to negative effects on the bacterial cell surface in different directions and extents the damage was much more serious in reactions containing dep al khudary et al 56 reported microorganism generally alters its cellular morphology so that the key cell properties could be protected the slower degradation of dep compared to dbp resulted from the severe cell damage caused by dep the morphological observation also suggested both dbp and dep especially at high concentrations damaged the cell surface by altering the permeability of cell membrane allowing dep to enter cells easier and leading to toxic effects on the functional enzymes responsible for degradation 57 consequently the isolate showed a preference of dbp when cultivated in mixture with dep and dep further exerted an inhibitory effect on the dbp degradation mainly by affecting cell membrane and causing lower esterase activity and variance of functional groups these results were also consistent with the highest protein and polysaccharide content seen at the initial stage to protect the cellular activities by secreting eps fig 3a 3 7 identification of intermediate metabolites and pathways for dbp and dep degradation by strain my156 the metabolic products of dbp and dep degradation by the isolate were detected via gc ms four main possible intermediates were tentatively identified as mbp for dbp degradation or mep for dep degradation pa and pca compared to the reference mass spectra for the dbp biodegradation mbp was considered as the metabolite from hydrolysis of one ester bond of dbp and is continuously hydrolyzed to pa similarly dep was transformed to mep during biodegradation followed by transformation to pca via deoxygenation by the ring cleavage enzymes and entering the tricarboxylic acid cycle based on these identified intermediates the dbp and or dep biodegradation was considered involving β oxidation de esterification and oxido reduction processes fig 4a the paes biodegradation usually starts with hydrolysis of the side chain ester further leading to a monoester along with pa as an essential intermediate product 3 for the degradation of dbp by strain my156 four main intermediates dep mbp pa and pca were detected while the dep biodegradation produced three metabolites mep pa and pca the similar intermediates have also been reported and identified in dbp and dep biodegradation by bacillus spp and other types of bacteria 15 42 44 58 as shown in fig 4 a pae with a shorter chain dep was degraded through de esterification of esters linking alkyl chain and aromatic ring transformed to mep and then to pa via hydrolysis in comparison pae with a longer chain dbp was either transformed to mbp through de esterification and then to pa through hydrolysis same as for dep or with the chain length reduced to dep through β oxidation this also shows hydrolysis and β oxidation are mainly responsible for the paes biodegradation consistent with a previous study reporting dbp and or corresponding monoester mehp simultaneously generated from dehp 58 on the other hand the hydrolysis of ester bonds was reported more effective than β oxidation 2 pa could then be further degraded to pca via oxidation reactions 59 gram positive bacteria such as the isolate strain my156 have been reported further degrading pa to 3 4 dihydroxyphthalate or pca by phthalate 3 4 dioxygenase or dehydrogenase 60 although no apparent peak of 3 4 dihydroxyphthalate could be identified during the dbp and dep biodegradation by strain my156 another common intermediate ba was also not detected during pae degradation in current study this might be due to the simple structures of these downstream metabolites leading to easy utilization by microorganisms 61 on the other hand the highest enzymatic activities for esterase and dehydrogenase responsible for hydrolysis and oxido reduction respectively were observed at the initial and subsequent stages respectively during the dbp and dep biodegradation which was also in accordance with the proposed tentative pathways and degradation mechanisms 3 8 molecular docking of dbp dep intermediates although the enzymatic activities during biodegradation of dbp and dep were in line with the metabolic pathways there still remained a limited knowledge on the function of potentially involved degradation genes and crystalline structures that are responsible for degradation of dbp and dep 62 therefore the docking analysis between hydrolase and paes as well as their monoesters can further contribute to a better understanding of the microbial degradation mechanisms for paes the docking study utilized dbp and dep and their corresponding monoesters mbp and mep respectively as intermediates with ligands connected with hydrolase from bacillus sp as receptors fig 5 the asn 213 residue of the hydrolase interacted with dbp through the hydrogen bonding the bond length is about 2 9 4 9 å and the binding energy is 4 97 kcal mol 1 figs 5a b residues leu 171 and lys 168 of the hydrolase contributed to the formation of hydrophobic binding pairs of alkyl groups in addition dbp interacted through a carbon bond with gly 172 while dep interacted with pro 214 and pro 222 of esterase by carbon bond with binding energy of 4 12 kcal mol 1 and bond length range of 2 5 4 7 å figs 5c d in case of the monoester docking both mbp and mep interacted with different residues of hydrolase via hydrogen bond interaction and carbon hydrogen bond with binding energy of 5 97 and 4 55 kcal mol 1 respectively figs 5e f the data for the molecular docking analysis may illustrate the whole docked paes and monoesters are with efficient bonds to the hydrolase via a conservative triplet structure results on the binding energy of the docked substances suggested the substrate preference of the hydrolase in the following order mbp dbp mep dep further implying the hydrolase preferred dbp to dep and similarly mbp to mep dbp mbp and mep are all interacted involved in the active site of hydrolase by forming hydrogen and carbon hydrogen bonds additionally the distance between the carbonyl carbon of studied compounds and the hydrolase is in the similar range which is in accordance with the michaelis menten es complex of other known hydrolases 63 many crystal structures of serine hydrolases have also been reported the function of active site residues vital for the adaptability of these hydrolases to catalyze various substances 58 64 considering the functional catalytic enzymes involved in hydrolysis of pae contaminants are rarely reported further work is warranted to be conducted on these hydrolase genes 45 3 9 bioaugmentation of synthetic contaminated marine water samples fig s3 shows the biodegradation results for the marine seawater samples contaminated supplemented with dbp and dep the natural degradation ability toward dbp and dep was very weak without the isolate inoculated a good performance of the isolate in seawater contaminated with dbp implies a robust candidate for the bioremediation of paes contaminated seawater the isolate showed almost complete degradation of dbp in marine samples similar to the results in bsm containing dbp as sole substrate however the isolate showed a relatively weak removal ability toward dep in remediating contaminated seawater compared to bsm containing dep as sole substrate showing 40 10 removal efficiency which was approximately 25 less than in the bsm 4 conclusions an indigenous isolate bacillus sp strain my156 was capable of degrading dbp and dep present signly and in mixture as growth substrates with significant removal efficiencies my156 showed a substrate preference of dbp to dep in mixture under the optimal conditions in terms of inoculum size bacterial load ph and temperature the biodegradation rate for dep was higher when mixed with dbp than present singly implying dbp with stimulatory effect on dep biodegradation in terms of vital enzyme activities and morphological response to cell surface the micro morphology analysis further revealed the cell surface structure and membrane damaged by dep more while the addition of dbp decreased this negative effect the molecular docking analysis showed the conservative triplet structure between dbp dep and their corresponding monoester with hydrolase bioaugmentation of the isolate to the synthetic marine water contaminated the mixture suggested the isolate has potential and applicability in dealing with real paes contaminated environmental sites

12426,an indigenous bacterial strain bacillus sp my156 was isolated from a local wastewater treatment plant and utilized for degradation of dibutyl phthalate dbp and diethyl phthalate dep the isolate showed a substrate preference of dbp to dep the optimal biodegradation conditions were ph 7 30 c 0 2 in terms of od600 inoculum size and 2 v v 1 bacterial load the biodegradation of dbp and dep as sole carbon source was comprehensively investigated via degradation kinetics and mass balance analysis the isolate achieved complete degradation and over 80 removal of 300 mg l 1 dbp within 60 h and 200 mg l 1 dep in 5 days the biodegradation of dbp and dep fitted the inhibitory kinetic model and the maximum degradation rates for dbp and dep were 183 34 and 66 90 mg l 1 day 1 respectively the cell surface responses to biodegradation were investigated by analyses of morphology fourier transform infrared and extracellular polymeric substance the potential intermediates were mono n butyl phthalate mono ethyl phthalate phthalic acid and protocatechuic acid by β oxidation hydrolysis and decarboxylation the esterase and dehydrogenase activities reached the highest at the initial and middle phases during biodegradation the docking studies also elucidated the relevant enzyme preferred dbp to dep via binding energy and bond distance graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords dibutyl phthalate diethyl phthalate biodegradation stoichiometry esterase data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction phthalic acid esters paes are widely utilized in commercial and industrial fields due to their characteristics of enhancing flexibility and durability of the polymer 1 2 because of the specialty in physical bond to polymer metric paes can be released slowly to the environment when producing applying and disposing the host polymers and leading potential risk to the environment 3 as a consequence paes are ubiquitous and easily detected in many natural environments such as wastewater seawater soil sediment and even vegetables 4 dibutyl phthalate dbp and diethyl phthalate dep are among the most abundant common paes occurring in the environment and exert the toxic risks of inducing mutagen and carcinoma causing accumulative worries to human life via daily nutrient intake 5 hence they have been categorized as critical pollutants by various countries and organizations such as china national environmental monitoring center environmental protection agency of the united states and the european union 3 dbp and dep in environment are generally degraded as results of hydrolytic action photolysis and biological degradation however their natural degradation occurs extremely slowly with potential for producing even more toxic byproducts thus biodegradation is recognized as a highly effective strategy for the paes contamination due to its economic and environmentally friendly properties during the removal process 3 6 various bacteria such as acinetobacter rhodococcus agrobacterium pseudomonas sphingobium providencia gordonia and bacillus sp have been reported efficiently degrading dbp and dep 7 9 since the paes exist concurrently in natural environments including wastewater treatment plants further understanding toward bacterial degrading availability for the pae contaminants existing in mixture is increasingly important 10 12 in general due to the structural complexity and recalcitrance long side chains paes such as dehp and dnop have been reported more difficult to be decomposed compared to short side chains phthalates such as dbp and dep 9 acinetobacter sp jdc 16 could attain complete degradation of 500 mg l 1 dep within 20 h at ph 8 and 35 c 13 while acinetobacter sp sn13 needed 5 days to degrade nearly 90 of 400 mg l 1 dehp 7 it has also been reported some bacteria showed preferential degradation rates when dealing with phthalates with longer alkyl chains quan et al 14 reported bacillus subtilis no 66 demonstrated strong ability in degrading dehp while it could hardly degrade dbp and dep zhang et al 15 discovered the degrading ability of bacillus mojavensis b1811 toward seven paes showing complete degradation of 500 mg l 1 dehp dbp bbp and dpp within 4 days whereas the phthalates with shortest alkyl chain like dmp only exhibited 5 9 degradation enzyme activity could be identified as a breakthrough for this unclear issue since it is in connection with the generation of interspace diffuse resistance via lateral chains instead of the length of side chains 16 many also reported the hydrolysis of ester bond played a key role in determining the degradation rate 2 6 17 furthermore together with hydrolases mainly esterase oxygenases are the enzymes involved in the paes biodegradation 18 consequently considering hydrolase together with oxygenases is vital for a deeper analysis of the microbial degradation mechanism for phthalates however there is still rare information about the interaction mechanisms of paes especially toward hydrolase the main enzyme involved during pae biodegradation and the information on esterase another important enzyme involved has been little 19 20 therefore this study aimed to enhance the understanding of interaction performances and the mechanisms behind during the concurrent biodegradation of common phthalate esters contaminants the indigenous bacillus sp my156 isolated from the local activated sludge was employed to degrade dbp and dep the biodegradation characteristics including degradation kinetics and mass balance analysis were assessed together with analysis of enzyme activity and response to cell surface and the interaction mechanisms between biodegradation of dbp and dep by the isolate were also explored 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals dbp and dep were of analytical grades purities up to 99 5 and purchased from aladdin methanol and hexane were of chromatographic grades other reagents used were all of analytical grades 2 2 culture medium and enrichment of paes degrader the bacterium used was isolated from a local wastewater treatment plant and identified as bacillus sp following

dissolved in methanol to prepare 10 g l 1 stock solutions in order to obtain pae as the only carbon source pae was added in serum bottles and put in fume hood for complete volatilization of methanol before used 23 tween 80 2 4 g l 1 was added to enhance the solubility of pae the strain was cultured in luria bertani lb medium which contained peptone 10 g l 1 nacl 10 g l 1 and yeast extract 5 g l 1 then the cultured bacterial suspension was under centrifugation 4000 rpm 10 min and washed with 0 01 m phosphoric acid buffer pbs ph 7 4 thrice 2 3 biodegradation of dbp and dep 2 3 1 effects of substrate concentration ph and temperature the seed culture 2 v v 1 was inoculated into serum bottles containing 50 ml bsm and different concentrations 50 500 mg l 1 of dbp or dep as growth substrate then the bottles were incubated at 30 0 5 c and 150 rpm in the dark one milliliter aliquots were collected at 12 h and 24 h intervals for dbp and dep respectively for the effects of ph and temperature the isolate was inoculated into bsm containing 100 mg l 1 of dbp and or dep at different phs 4 10 and temperatures 25 30 and 40 c and the samples were taken each day the interaction between dbp and dep in the mixture was evaluated at 300 mg l 1 dbp and 100 mg l 1 dep respectively the degradation efficiencies for dbp and dep singly or in mixture were calculated using the following equation 24 total degradation efficiency 100 c i c f c i where ci and cf represent the initial and final concentrations of dbp or dep respectively the cell growth was measured as od600 2 3 2 biodegradation kinetics the inhibitory equation was applied to analyze the biodegradation and bacterial growth kinetic parameters for the isolate as follows 25 1 d d m s ks s s 2 k i 2 μ μ m s k s s s 2 k i where d mg l 1 day 1 and dm mg l 1 day 1 represent degradation rate and maximum degradation rate respectively μ and μm are specific growth rate day 1 and maximum specific growth rate day 1 s mg l 1 is the concentration of the substrate dbp or dep ks mg l 1 and ki mg l 1 represent half saturation constant and inhibition constant respectively 2 3 3 mass balance and stoichiometric analysis according to shuler and kargi 26 a general treatment mechanism for stoichiometry and mass balance within biological conversion for organic matter is shown as follows chmon ao2 bnh3 ccαhβoγnδ dh2o eco2 3 4 yield biomass substrate x x 0 s 0 s where x and x0 mg l 1 dry cell weight represent the biomass concentration at the end and beginning of reaction respectively and s and s0 mg l 1 represent the final and initial substrate concentration respectively from these equations mass balance on each element and biomass yield from dbp and dep as single substrate were obtained 2 4 removal mechanisms for dbp and dep by isolate biodegradation bd of dbp and dep by the isolate can be shown as follows 27 5 b d a t a r a d a p a c 100 a t where at mg l 1 is the initial concentration of dbp and dep ar mg l 1 is the

complete separation of aqueous fraction and organic phase the organic phase supernatant was collected to measure the concentration of dbp and dep adsorbed on the cell surface the residual cell pellets were suspended by adding 5 ml of dichloromethane and methanol 1 2 v v 1 and sonicated for 30 min 40 khz 2 2 kw after centrifugation 4000 rpm 10 min the supernatant was collected to analyze the concentration of bioaccumulated dbp and dep 2 5 enzyme activity assay the hydrolase and oxidoreductase activities were assessed during biodegradation of dbp and dep the hydrolase activity was determined via two different methods by hplc thermo scientific u s a and uv mini 1240 spectrophotometer shimadzu japan the dbp and dep hydrolase treatment systems were assessed via reaction between enzyme solutions 100 mm tris hcl buffer ph 8 0 and 1 mm dbp and or dep at 40 c for 10 min and ending by adding 3 m hcl 10 v v 1 the reaction products were extracted by ethyl acetate and then detected by hplc for the residual activity enzyme activity with no extra compounds was considered as 100 29 30 esterase as the main hydrolase during pae degradation was also examined in current study the p

synthetic pae contaminated marine water samples marine water samples were collected from the intertidal of hac sa bay macau special administrative region china the cultured seed was inoculated in glass serum bottles 2 v v 1 containing 50 ml of marine water pretreated with 100 mg l 1 of dbp and or dep seawater containing same concentration of pae without inoculation was set as control group the reaction conditions were same as the above treatment 2 8 chemical analysis and identification of the proposed metabolites the tested samples were first centrifugated 12 000 rpm 10 min and filtered via 0 22 μm membrane filters millipore before further measurements the concentrations of dbp and dep were analyzed by a dionex ultimate 3000 hplc thermo scientific u s a equipped with acclaimtm c18 reversed phase column 5 mm 4 6 150 mm and dionex ultimate 3000 diode array detector hplc dad the injection volume and uv wavelength were 80 μl and 196 nm respectively the flow rate and oven temperature were 0 8 ml min 1 and 35 c respectively the mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile a and deionized water b ph adjusted to 3 by formic acid the gradient elution of dbp and dep was carried out as follows 0 2 5 min 70 a b 2 5 8 min 70 95 a b 8 15 min 95 a b 15 20 min and 70 a b the retention times for dbp and dep were approximately 6 5 min and 3 1 min respectively the operation and set parameters for the proposed intermediates produced during biodegradation of dbp and dep were same as xie et al 21 which were identified by gc ms thermo scientific u s a equipped with a tg 5ms column 0 25 μm 0 25 mm 30 m samples were extracted by n hexane with sequential treatments vortex sonication and centrifugation the supernatant was recovered and filtered through 0 22 μm membrane the recovery efficiencies for these paes were both above 95 2 9 molecule docking analysis the properties and performance of hydrolase were estimated via docking between paes and the relevant monoesters and enzyme through the autodock vina tools the structures of dbp dep mbp and mep were found in pubchem compound database 34 the minimum binding energy scores were chosen via pymol 35 and the visualization was performed through the discovery studio 2 10 statistical analysis all the treatments were carried out in triplicates the graphpad prism 9 4 was applied for the significance analysis and origin 2019b and graphpad prism 9 4 were utilized for generation of the diagrams 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of different conditions on dbp and dep biodegradation the aerobic biodegradation of paes is reported being influenced by several environmental factors such as temperature ph inoculum size oxygen amount initial concentration of pae as substrate and nutrient availability 3 these factors mainly influence the cellular activity of microorganisms as well as the enzymatic activities and the level of dbp and dep biodegradation is reported extensively subject to the optimization of environmental conditions 6 figs 1 2 a and 2 d show the effects of such different factors as inoculum size bacterial load co cultivation utilizing mixture of dbp and dep initial ph and temperature and initial concentration of dbp and dep on the biodegradation efficiencies for the isolate my156 the removal efficiencies for dbp and dep increased when the inoculum size increased from 0 2 to 0 6 in terms of od600 while the efficiency did not increase with the inoculum size increased from 0 6 to 1 0 therefore the optimal inoculum size was considered 0 6 od600 the increasing bacterial load from 1 to 10 v v 1 also increased the biodegradation of dbp and dep the isolate showed strong dbp degrading abilities at various bacterial loads while with strong dep degrading abilities at low and high bacterial loads only thus the optimal bacterial load for the highest degradation of both paes was considered 2 on the other hand the alkaline condition ph 6 9 was more favorable for the biodegradation of dbp while the dep biodegradation was affected more by the ph value the removal efficiency was the highest at ph 7 for dbp 99 93 and dep 74 42 in case of temperature the isolate showed a higher removal efficiency 98 83 for dbp at 40 c compared to 25 c with the removal efficiency of 63 60 in comparison the isolate was not affected by temperature for the removal of dep showing 43 15 and 49 62 removal efficiencies at 25 and 40 c respectively therefore the optimal temperature for dbp and dep degradation by the isolate was considered 30 c 3 2 interaction mechanisms for and effects of binary dbp and dep biodegradation although there have been many findings related to the pae degrading bacteria it is still important to know the degradation ability of pure culture toward different types of paes considering paes as contaminants generally co existing in the real environments 5 24 36 the microbial removal processes for organic matter such as sorption degradation and accumulation would also contribute to the co pollution 37 therefore the interactive effects of dbp and dep on strain my156 characteristics and removal efficiencies were further explored from their co existence under different conditions mainly ph and temperature in current study in terms of the interaction mechanisms during dbp and dep degradation under various experimental conditions the performance for the binary mixture biodegradation of dbp and dep at different phs and temperatures is shown in figs 1 c f based on the comparison of the removal efficiencies for dbp and dep in the mixture the addition of dbp showed resulting in the stimulatory effect on dep degradation by the isolate there were 18 53 more degradation of dep while the extra dep resulted in a slightly inhibitory effect on dbp degradation showing 0 07 less degradation of dbp under the optimal conditions fig 1c for the effect of ph on binary degradation the addition of dep inhibited dbp biodegradation at acidic phs 4 7 while it stimulated the removal of dbp at alkaline phs fig 1d however the addition of dbp significantly enhanced the dep biodegradation regardless of acidic or alkaline conditions fig 1e this might be due to the increase of hydroxyl ion concentration leading to the difference of the hydrolase activity and substances binding 38 while there might be extra acid intermediates produced from dep biodegradation resulting in decrease of the dbp degradation under acid conditions 39 in case of temperature the addition of dep stimulated dbp biodegradation at lower temperature 33 02 of dbp were further removed at 25 c while the additional dbp stimulated dep biodegradation at higher temperature 29 30 of dep were further removed at 30 c at high temperature the results showed a slightly inhibitory effect when other pae was added showing 5 63 less degradation of dbp and 1 40 less degradation of dep in the mixture treatments respectively fig 1f it is likely resulted from the stimulation of heat stable enzymes from strain my156 to produce additional surfactant at high temperature which could enhance the solubility of paes 40 in case of the multi factor analysis of variance apart from bacterial load and co cultivation with dep other experimental factors such as ph temperature initial substrate concentration and inoculum size significantly affected the dbp degradation by isolate my156 while all the aforementioned factors significantly affected the dep biodegradation the isolate showed the highest removal efficiency at ph 7 for dbp completely removed and dep 74 41 removed in addition the isolate removed more dbp under alkaline conditions from one way analysis of variance anova results further implying the isolate with a significantly strong tolerance to alkaline conditions on the other hand the isolate showed the degradability for dbp and dep over a wide range of temperature including biodegradation of dbp at high temperature further implying these conditions allowing heat resistant enzymes to perform high catalytic activities during biodegradation 39 the isolate bacillus sp my156 removed substrates dbp and dep simultaneously under the co existence condition but with different removal efficiencies fig 1 in mixture dbp was removed almost 100 while dep removed as high as over 90 at ph 7 figs 1d e therefore the isolate showed a substrate preference dbp over dep these results would further imply a potential to choose a more suitable microorganism for the highly efficient removal of paes mixture co existence of dbp and dep also stimulated the mixture biodegradation under alkaline conditions fig 1d it may be due to the additional pae leading to the change of lower ph caused by such intermediates as pa and co2 subsequently providing more alkaline conditions suitable for the strain growth 40 3 3 biodegradation kinetics the isolate degraded various initial concentrations 50 500 mg l 1 of dbp and dep as shown in fig 2 for dbp there was no obvious lag phase in terms of biodegradation regardless of the initial concentration including almost complete removal of dbp at 300 mg l 1 within 3 days fig 2a the removal efficiency for 500 mg l 1 dbp was over 94 7 within 5 days for dep in comparison after a short lag phase the biodegradation increased over time up to the removal efficiency of 80 39 for 200 mg l 1 dep within 5 days fig 2d compared to other previously reported dbp and or dep degrading bacteria the isolate showed a competitive degradation ability for dbp showing complete removal in 60 h relatively shorter at the initial concentration of 300 mg l 1 while showing slower removal efficiencies for dep table 3 in comparison gordonia alkanivorans strain yc rl2 and paracoccus kondratievae strain bjq0001 showed the higher degradation abilities toward paes with shorter side chains 2 41 in general the paes degradability of microorganisms is considered dependent on their length of side chains and molecular weights mw 6 7 dbp has a higher mw 278 40 and longer side chains compared to dep mw 222 08 the dbp and dep degrading isolate bacillus sp my156 in current study was previously reported efficiently degrading dehp 21 some previous studies also reported bacillus spp with degradation abilities toward paes including dbp dep dmp bbp dehp etc with competitive removal efficiencies 15 21 42 44 the degradation ability of bacillus sp my156 toward dbp and dep was similar to bacillus mojavensis b1811 and rhodococcus sp 2g which also showed a faster degradation of dbp than dep 13 45 the biodegradation of paes with different lengths of side chains is also reported dependent on the extremely specific characteristics and activities of enzymes playing key roles in pae hydrolysis 15 figs 2 b c and figs 2 e f show the comparison between simulated and experimentally obtained results of cell growth measured as od600 and degradation rates for different initial concentrations of dbp and dep utilized as sole growth substrate the biodegradation kinetics parameters of dm maximum degradation rate μm maximum specific growth rate ks half saturation constant and ki inhibition constant for haldane s inhibition kinetics are further summarized in table 1 for both dbp and dep the biodegradation kinetics clearly showed the inhibition for both cell growth and degradation except the growth on dep up to 300 mg l 1 figs 2b c e f the highest biodegradation rates for dbp and dep were at the initial concentrations of 500 and 200 mg l 1 respectively and the degradation rate began to decrease when the concentrations were higher the cell growth was also in accordance with the degradation rate for dep showing the highest at 200 mg l 1 while for dbp the highest cell growth was observed at 400 mg l 1 the degradation ability of strain my156 toward dbp and dep as single growth substrate showed similar kinetics which fitted well to the inhibition model while with totally different biodegradation rates for each pae fig 2 and table 1 the exploration of biodegradation kinetics over a wide range of substrate concentrations was beneficial to comprehend the biodegradation characteristics of the isolate toward paes in addition the estimation of biodegradation kinetics parameters especially for high concentrations of substrate is important to completely understand the bacterial degradation properties 2 in current study as the concentrations of dbp and dep increased to 500 and 200 mg l 1 respectively the biodegradation rate decreased further implying less applicability of the isolate for bioaugmentation of the environment heavily contaminated with dbp and dep 3 4 mass balance and stoichiometry in general the organic contaminant uptake by active cells involves three phases the first stage is quick adsorption bioaccumulation through the cell wall and membrane occurs in the second step 46 at the final phase contaminants are decomposed by enzymatic activities 47 as shown in table 2 the main removal mechanisms for dbp and dep at 100 mg l 1 each were biodegradation with 99 51 and 72 01 removal efficiencies for dbp and dep respectively after 5 days of cultivation in comparison the amounts of dbp and dep sorbed to the cell surface were 0 28 and 1 79 respectively and the bioaccumulated amount was less with 0 21 and 0 31 for dbp and dep respectively the mass balance analysis considered biomass value dissolved oxygen do concentration and dbp dep concentration in current study at the beginning of cultivation the do level of the culture was 7 85 mg l 1 on average used for the aerobic biodegradation of dbp and dep as sole growth substrate as well as the aerobic growth of the isolate the level of chemical oxygen demand cod was also examined and the result showed over 95 of cod were removed by the isolate data not shown the stoichiometry analysis for dbp and dep degradation and cell growth was based on the dry weight of biomass 48 using the general biomass formula of c5h7o2n there were 1 1 5 and 3 3 5 of carbons from dbp and dep converted to biomass respectively therefore the stoichiometric equations were as follows 6 for dbp c 16 h 22 o 4 ao 2 bnh 3 cc 5 h 7 o 2 n dh 2 o eco 2 substrate biomass 7 for dep c 12 h 14 o 4 ao 2 bnh 3 cc 5 h 7 o 2 n dh 2 o eco 2 substrate biomass in current study ammonia was identified as the form of ammonium nitrate from bsm during the nitrogen mass balance based on the aforementioned information the following equations represented for c h n and o elements balance unlabelled table dbp dep c balance 16 5c e c balance 12 5c e h balance 22 3b 7c 2d h balance 14 3b 7c 2d o balance 4 2a 2c d 2e o balance 4 2a 2c d 2e n balance b c n balance b c from the above equations the following stoichiometric equations for dbp and dep biodegradation were derived 8 for dbp c 16 h 22 o 4 15 98 o 2 0 70 nh 3 0 70 c 5 h 7 o 2 n 9 59 h 2 o 12 48 co 2 9 for dep c 12 h 14 o 4 5 58 o 2 1 58 nh 3 1 58 c 5 h 7 o 2 n 3 83 h 2 o 4 08 co 2 the biomass cell yields for dbp and dep were considered 0 30 and 0 32 respectively the biomass yield value of 0 30 for dbp biodegradation in current study is also comparable with kumar et al 49 who reported 0 37 and 0 35 for dbp biodegradation by comamonas sp and pseudomonas sp on the other hand the low bioadsorption and bioaccumulation ability of the isolate toward dbp and dep table 2 may be due to their properties having non covalent bonds with other substances present 4 3 5 enzyme activity assay figs 4 b d show the activities of enzymes dbp and dep hydrolase esterase and dehydrogenase during biodegradation of single and binary paes the results from the dbp and dep hydrolase activity fig 4b suggested the addition of dep resulted in a slightly inhibitory effect on dbp degradation p 0 0 05 while the extra dbp would increase the dep hydrolase activity 1 44 more residual activity of dep hydrolase was present in the mixture groups the esterase activities in three different treatments reached the highest after 24 h showing the higher activity when dbp was as sole substrate compared to when dep as sole substrate or dbp dep present as dual substrates figs 4c and s2a in comparison there was no significant difference between dehydrogenase activities among three groups figs 4d and s2b and the highest activities were observed in the mid to late stages of cultivation between 48 and 72 h the dehydrogenase activities were higher when dbp was present as single substrate or dual substrates with dep compared to when dep was single substrate biodegradation of hydrophobic organic pollutants by bacteria is generally possible due to hydrolytic actions and oxidization enzyme reactions mediated by hydrolase and oxidoreductase respectively among those enzymes esterase is the most principal hydrolase utilized in bioremediation contributing to the catalysis of water incorporated with substrate via the aliphatic nucleophilic substitution 50 esterase also plays an essential role in biodegradation of paes via hydrolysis to the corresponding monoesters phthalates 18 results showed the phthalate ester compound with long side chains e g dbp was degraded more than the compound with short side chains e g dep further suggesting more effective degradability toward dbp compared to dep for the isolate another vital enzymes involved in the paes biodegradation are oxidoreductases including dehydrogenases oxygenases and hemeperoxidases contributing to catalyze redox reactions where transfer of electrons or hydrogen and oxygen atoms to substrates occurs 51 dehydrogenases also act significantly for the oxidization of organic contaminants and are responsible for the comprehensive metabolic activities of microorganisms therefore for further assessment of mechanisms and performances of paes biodegradation current study also investigated the dehydrogenases values and found dbp and dep would stimulate the dehydrogenase activity as well as serving as growth substrates 52 on the other hand considering the esterase activity as a key sign for the catalysis function the addition of dep exerted an inhibitory effect on the esterase activity for the dbp biodegradation while the additional dbp showed no apparent effect on the functional groups involving dep the result also showed the inhibitory effect attributed by dep is observed mainly at the initial hydrolysis step 3 6 cell surface characteristics 3 6 1 extracellular polymeric substance eps the concentrations of eps polysaccharide and protein during biodegradation of dbp and dep present singly and in mixture are shown figs 3 a and s1 when dbp and dep were degraded singly the highest concentration of eps secreted was observed in 72 h when the isolate grew to maturity and the cell surface severely damaged by dep and the intermediate products from dbp in comparison when two paes were degraded in mixture the isolate did not show any obvious difference compared to the results from the single substrate cultivation in terms of the concentration of eps secreted p 0 05 since eps is a secretion produced by the normal physiological process of microorganisms it can form a protective layer of cells when the environmental condition changes the self protection and survival mechanism of microorganisms will play an essential role causing the fluctuation of eps secretion of microorganisms 52 the concentration of eps shows the mixture of dbp and dep might protect the cell structure more compared to dep only fig 3a 3 6 2 ft ir analysis bioavailability also has a vital effect on the biodegradation process the ft ir spectra showed both paes with the functional groups affected during biodegradation of dbp and dep singly and in mixture they further showed the peaks appeared concentrated implying more complex substances were produced on the cell surface of the strain compared to its cultivation on glucose fig 3b the spectra between three different groups dbp alone dep alone and dbp dep mixture are mostly different at the wave numbers from 1455 53 to 1636 29 cm 1 which represented varieties of ch2 ch3 aromatic rings and amide groups 47 showing the apparent complexity of functional groups in addition to the shift of functional groups related to the π π eda effect 53 no obvious offset was detected in single pae and binary pae absorption apart from the peak at 517 84 cm 1 in dbp and 517 62 cm 1 in dep shifting to 525 75 cm 1 in the mixture of dbp and dep similarly this phenomenon appeared at 1057 19 cm 1 in dbp and 1059 45 cm 1 in dep shifted to the peak at 1064 30 cm 1 when the compounds co existed zhang et al 47 assigned this region to p o c bonding in rna another offset region appeared at approximately 1057 cm 1 for single pae dbp shifted to the peak at 1064 30 cm 1 in mixture with dep this was attributed to amide bonds occurred between amino group and carboxyl group from the biodegradation intermediates 54 luo et al 46 reported the ch2 groups and protein in the cell walls might also be involved in dbp adsorption considering alkanes and amide were reported also involved in the biological sorption of chromium 55 the additional dbp or dep in mixture might influence the bio sorption process for the originally existing pae by the interaction between functional groups and cell surface 3 6 3 micro morphological analysis the scanning electron micrographs for the isolate after different treatments when dbp and dep were utilized as substrates solely and in mixture are shown in figs 3 c f the sem analysis suggested strain my156 is long rod shaped with complete smooth structure fig 3c after adding dbp the cell surface edge was clear and the shape remained as a long column with several apparent holes appeared at the cell surface fig 3d in comparison however the cell surface became wrinkled and the structures of some cells even disappeared in the dep treatment fig 3e the sem results figs 3c f showed the high concentrations of dbp and dep would lead to negative effects on the bacterial cell surface in different directions and extents the damage was much more serious in reactions containing dep al khudary et al 56 reported microorganism generally alters its cellular morphology so that the key cell properties could be protected the slower degradation of dep compared to dbp resulted from the severe cell damage caused by dep the morphological observation also suggested both dbp and dep especially at high concentrations damaged the cell surface by altering the permeability of cell membrane allowing dep to enter cells easier and leading to toxic effects on the functional enzymes responsible for degradation 57 consequently the isolate showed a preference of dbp when cultivated in mixture with dep and dep further exerted an inhibitory effect on the dbp degradation mainly by affecting cell membrane and causing lower esterase activity and variance of functional groups these results were also consistent with the highest protein and polysaccharide content seen at the initial stage to protect the cellular activities by secreting eps fig 3a 3 7 identification of intermediate metabolites and pathways for dbp and dep degradation by strain my156 the metabolic products of dbp and dep degradation by the isolate were detected via gc ms four main possible intermediates were tentatively identified as mbp for dbp degradation or mep for dep degradation pa and pca compared to the reference mass spectra for the dbp biodegradation mbp was considered as the metabolite from hydrolysis of one ester bond of dbp and is continuously hydrolyzed to pa similarly dep was transformed to mep during biodegradation followed by transformation to pca via deoxygenation by the ring cleavage enzymes and entering the tricarboxylic acid cycle based on these identified intermediates the dbp and or dep biodegradation was considered involving β oxidation de esterification and oxido reduction processes fig 4a the paes biodegradation usually starts with hydrolysis of the side chain ester further leading to a monoester along with pa as an essential intermediate product 3 for the degradation of dbp by strain my156 four main intermediates dep mbp pa and pca were detected while the dep biodegradation produced three metabolites mep pa and pca the similar intermediates have also been reported and identified in dbp and dep biodegradation by bacillus spp and other types of bacteria 15 42 44 58 as shown in fig 4 a pae with a shorter chain dep was degraded through de esterification of esters linking alkyl chain and aromatic ring transformed to mep and then to pa via hydrolysis in comparison pae with a longer chain dbp was either transformed to mbp through de esterification and then to pa through hydrolysis same as for dep or with the chain length reduced to dep through β oxidation this also shows hydrolysis and β oxidation are mainly responsible for the paes biodegradation consistent with a previous study reporting dbp and or corresponding monoester mehp simultaneously generated from dehp 58 on the other hand the hydrolysis of ester bonds was reported more effective than β oxidation 2 pa could then be further degraded to pca via oxidation reactions 59 gram positive bacteria such as the isolate strain my156 have been reported further degrading pa to 3 4 dihydroxyphthalate or pca by phthalate 3 4 dioxygenase or dehydrogenase 60 although no apparent peak of 3 4 dihydroxyphthalate could be identified during the dbp and dep biodegradation by strain my156 another common intermediate ba was also not detected during pae degradation in current study this might be due to the simple structures of these downstream metabolites leading to easy utilization by microorganisms 61 on the other hand the highest enzymatic activities for esterase and dehydrogenase responsible for hydrolysis and oxido reduction respectively were observed at the initial and subsequent stages respectively during the dbp and dep biodegradation which was also in accordance with the proposed tentative pathways and degradation mechanisms 3 8 molecular docking of dbp dep intermediates although the enzymatic activities during biodegradation of dbp and dep were in line with the metabolic pathways there still remained a limited knowledge on the function of potentially involved degradation genes and crystalline structures that are responsible for degradation of dbp and dep 62 therefore the docking analysis between hydrolase and paes as well as their monoesters can further contribute to a better understanding of the microbial degradation mechanisms for paes the docking study utilized dbp and dep and their corresponding monoesters mbp and mep respectively as intermediates with ligands connected with hydrolase from bacillus sp as receptors fig 5 the asn 213 residue of the hydrolase interacted with dbp through the hydrogen bonding the bond length is about 2 9 4 9 å and the binding energy is 4 97 kcal mol 1 figs 5a b residues leu 171 and lys 168 of the hydrolase contributed to the formation of hydrophobic binding pairs of alkyl groups in addition dbp interacted through a carbon bond with gly 172 while dep interacted with pro 214 and pro 222 of esterase by carbon bond with binding energy of 4 12 kcal mol 1 and bond length range of 2 5 4 7 å figs 5c d in case of the monoester docking both mbp and mep interacted with different residues of hydrolase via hydrogen bond interaction and carbon hydrogen bond with binding energy of 5 97 and 4 55 kcal mol 1 respectively figs 5e f the data for the molecular docking analysis may illustrate the whole docked paes and monoesters are with efficient bonds to the hydrolase via a conservative triplet structure results on the binding energy of the docked substances suggested the substrate preference of the hydrolase in the following order mbp dbp mep dep further implying the hydrolase preferred dbp to dep and similarly mbp to mep dbp mbp and mep are all interacted involved in the active site of hydrolase by forming hydrogen and carbon hydrogen bonds additionally the distance between the carbonyl carbon of studied compounds and the hydrolase is in the similar range which is in accordance with the michaelis menten es complex of other known hydrolases 63 many crystal structures of serine hydrolases have also been reported the function of active site residues vital for the adaptability of these hydrolases to catalyze various substances 58 64 considering the functional catalytic enzymes involved in hydrolysis of pae contaminants are rarely reported further work is warranted to be conducted on these hydrolase genes 45 3 9 bioaugmentation of synthetic contaminated marine water samples fig s3 shows the biodegradation results for the marine seawater samples contaminated supplemented with dbp and dep the natural degradation ability toward dbp and dep was very weak without the isolate inoculated a good performance of the isolate in seawater contaminated with dbp implies a robust candidate for the bioremediation of paes contaminated seawater the isolate showed almost complete degradation of dbp in marine samples similar to the results in bsm containing dbp as sole substrate however the isolate showed a relatively weak removal ability toward dep in remediating contaminated seawater compared to bsm containing dep as sole substrate showing 40 10 removal efficiency which was approximately 25 less than in the bsm 4 conclusions an indigenous isolate bacillus sp strain my156 was capable of degrading dbp and dep present signly and in mixture as growth substrates with significant removal efficiencies my156 showed a substrate preference of dbp to dep in mixture under the optimal conditions in terms of inoculum size bacterial load ph and temperature the biodegradation rate for dep was higher when mixed with dbp than present singly implying dbp with stimulatory effect on dep biodegradation in terms of vital enzyme activities and morphological response to cell surface the micro morphology analysis further revealed the cell surface structure and membrane damaged by dep more while the addition of dbp decreased this negative effect the molecular docking analysis showed the conservative triplet structure between dbp dep and their corresponding monoester with hydrolase bioaugmentation of the isolate to the synthetic marine water contaminated the mixture suggested the isolate has potential and applicability in dealing with real paes contaminated environmental sites

12427,in recent years spills of petroleum and organic chemicals have frequently occurred during their transportation at sea which has caused serious pollution for water resources in view of this a superhydrophobic pu cb fas sponge with excellent photothermal conversion performance was prepared and its microscopic morphology and wettability were investigated in this paper the results showed that the skeleton of pu cb fas sponge was covered with a layer of cb nanoparticles and elements such as f and si were found on the skeleton surface subsequently the water contact angle of the pu cb fas sponge was measured to be 151 and the sponge was able to separate oil water mixtures in different ways when the sponge was used as an adsorbent material its saturation capacity was 27 11 59 96 g g 1 for low viscosity oils organic solvents such as soybean oil finally the pu cb fas sponge s photothermal conversion performance was investigated at a light power density of 1 sun 1 0 kw m2 and the sponge s adsorption capacity for crude oil was increased by 15 times compared with the condition of without light thus the pu cb fas sponge successfully achieved rapid oil water separation and adsorption for high viscosity crude oil showing a broad practical application prospect graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords carbon black superhydrophobic oil water separation polyurethane sponge photothermal conversion data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction as an important natural resource petroleum has greatly improved the quality of human life but spills often occur during the exploration and transportation of petroleum this not only causes the waste of valuable resources but also seriously harms the ecology of the ocean 1 2 traditional methods for treating oil pollution mainly include electrochemical method flotation centrifugation filtration gravity separation and in situ combustion if these methods are applied in the field they generally have disadvantages such as cumbersome operation high price and low separation efficiency in recent years the adsorption method has been recognized the best solution for oil spill incidents because of its simple operation and environmental friendliness 3 as inspired by natural superhydrophobic phenomena scientists have developed a variety of porous adsorbent materials with special wettability such materials used to treat oily wastewater can be a good solution to solve the problems of traditional methods however untreated oil is usually characterized by high viscosity and low mobility as a result adsorbent materials exhibit poor adsorption performance when they were applied to offshore oil spill situations 4 5 at present researchers mainly focused on improving the adsorbent materials adsorption performance on crude oil by reducing the crude oil s viscosity 6 7 gong et al designed an mxene coated polyurethane sponge ti3c2t x pu 8 when a voltage was applied to this sponge the viscosity of the crude oil decreased along with the generation of joule heat therefore the sponge could use its capillary force to adsorb low viscosity crude oil in this way high viscosity crude oil would be cleaned although this electric heating method can achieve the purpose of cleaning crude oil it still has the disadvantages of high cost complicated to operate and can only be applied near the coast 9 11 solar energy is the most abundant and clean energy source on our planet it would be ideal if solar energy could be used to power an oil spill wang et al designed a thermoplastic polyurethane tpu porous monolith with reduced graphene oxide encapsulation and fluoroalkylsilane modification 12 the monolith exhibited an excellent photothermal effect and could continuously absorb crude oil by connecting a vacuum pump habibi et al prepared a photothermal pu mwcnt bnf ar sponge with good thermal resistance superhydrophobicity and superhydrophilicity by dip coating method 32 the surface temperature of this sponge could rise to 94 2 c under 1 sun power density 1 0 kw m2 the heat generated by light heating could reduce the viscosity of crude oil from 5800 mpa s to 48 4 mpa s which helped the sponge to absorb crude oil qin et al prepared a solar driven cellulose sponge pbzrgos by immobilizing reduced graphene oxide rgo on the backbone of a cellulose sponge using polybenzoxazine pbz as a binder 33 under the irradiation of 1 sun power density 1 0 kw m2 pbzrgos could rapidly absorb crude oil on the water surface within 140 s its adsorption capacity of crude oil was 15 7 times higher than that in the absence of light yang et al prepared janus sponges by deposition method using polydopamine tio2 and melamine formaldehyde ms sponges as raw materials 34 under 1 sun power density 1 0 kw m2 the bottom surface temperature of the janus sponge increased to 70 c in 10 min and 6 μl of crude oil could be adsorbed in 6 s however although the use of solar energy could significantly reduce the operational cost of adsorbing crude oil most of the adsorbent materials researchers have developed still suffer from high preparation costs 13 15 therefore the development of adsorbent materials with both low raw cost and excellent photothermal effect is of great value in dealing with large scale oil spills carbon black cb has natural black property and good light absorbing property in the entire solar spectrum besides cb has the advantages of large specific surface area and wide source which is widely used in photothermal conversion 31 compared with the other loadings of the photothermal adsorption materials mentioned above such as ti3c2tx go rgo mwcnt and tio2 the price of cb is at least tens of times cheaper so far there are few studies regarding cb in oil water separation and crude oil adsorption problems if cb nanoparticles and porous materials can be combined the cost of crude oil adsorption would be greatly saved among many porous materials commercial polyurethane pu sponge has been a research focus with many advantages such as low cost good mechanical properties and high porosity in view of this we tried to find a reliable method that could combine cb nanoparticles and pu sponge together because if they are not firmly bonded a very serious problem of slagging would occur dopamine is an important component of the mucus secreted by organisms such as marine mussels in tris solution at ph 8 5 it can undergo self polymerization reaction to generate polydopamine coating and the amine and carboxyl groups in polydopamine can chemically react with functional groups such as hydroxyl and carboxyl groups on the surface of cb nanoparticles these chemical reactions can bind the polydopamine tightly on the surface of cb nanoparticles thus making cb fixed on the pu sponge skeleton notably it has been demonstrated that cb nanoparticles can be deposited on pu sponge skeletons by the adhesion of polydopamine for example huang et al used dopamine to form polydopamine by self polymerization in a slightly alkaline solution 35 they prepared sponge sensors by adhering cb nanoparticles and graphene nanosheets to polyurethane sponges through the adhesion effect of polydopamine in this study superhydrophobic pu cb fas sponge with photothermal effect was prepared by dip coating method using low cost pu sponge cb nanoparticles and fluorinated silane coupling agent fas among the raw materials low surface energy substances fas were used to fluorinate the sponge skeleton to improve the sponge s hydrophobicity this work focused on pu cb fas sponge s microscopic morphology adsorption performance on low viscosity oil photothermal conversion performance and adsorption performance on high viscosity crude oil in addition the variation pattern between the concentration of fas and the wettability of pu cb fas sponge was also tightly studied this newly developed pu cb fas sponge provides an excellent adsorption material for cleaning up oil spill 2 experiment 2 1 materials pu sponge was purchased from dongguan jereh polymer material co tris hydroxymethyl aminomethane and trimethoxy 1h 1h 2h 2h heptadecafluorodecyl silane were purchased from shanghai maclean biochemical technology co dopamine hydrochloride ethanol dichloromethane xylene ccl4 and n hexane were purchased from shanghai aladdin biochemical technology co cb nanoparticles model vulcan xc 72 average diameter 30 nm were purchased from cabot usa soybean oil was purchased from a local supermarket pump oil and gasoline were purchased from china petroleum chemical corporation deionized water was homemade in our laboratory crude oil was provided by sinopec hainan refining chemical co 2 2 preparation of pu cb fas the preparation process of pu cb fas sponge was shown in fig 1 a first 200 mg cb nanoparticles was added to 50 ml tris buffer solution 0 1 mol l 1 ph 8 5 and sonicated for 1 h then 150 mg dopamine hydrochloride was dissolved into above suspension subsequently the pu sponge was submerged in the solution and stirred for 12 h after stirring the sponge was removed and cleaned with deionized water this purpose was to remove the cb nanoparticles that were not firmly adhered to the sponge skeleton next the dried pu cb sponge was submerged in 50 ml ethanol solution containing different concentrations of fas molecules 0 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 mg ml 1 and continued to stir for 12 h finally the sponge was dried again to produce the last pu cb fas sponge fig 1 b showed the comparison of the pu sponge and pu cb fas sponge s real picture it could be seen that after the loading of cb nanoparticles the sponge changed from light yellow color to black color when the pu cb fas sponge was cut in halves it could be clearly seen that its interior also showed a single black color therefore it initially proved that the cb nanoparticles were completely loaded on the sponge skeleton fig 1 c showed the compression recovery process of the pu cb fas sponge this process visually reflected the sponge s good compressibility and recoverability which provided a beneficial condition for recycled oil absorption 2 3 characterization scanning electron microscopy sigma 300 zeiss germany was used to observe the pu sponge and pu cb fas sponge s microscopic morphologies before observation the samples that were cut into 5 mm 5 mm size needed to be vacuum gold sprayed meanwhile the elements of pu cb fas sponge were analyzed using energy dispersive x ray spectrometry next the pu sponge and pu cb fas sponge were cut to 3 mm 3 mm and they were analyzed for elemental composition and valence bonding using an x ray photoelectron spectrometer k alpha thermo fisher english in addition the water oil contact angles of pu cb fas sponges with different fas concentrations were tested using a contact angle measuring instrument jc2000c1 shanghai zhongchen china a thermogravimetric analyzer tga 550 ta instruments america was used to test the thermal stability of pu cb fas sponge with a heating rate of 20 c min and a temperature range of 30 800 c there were two tests of sponges photothermal conversion performance one was the absorption capacity of pu sponge and pu cb fas sponge to light using a uv vis spectrophotometer lambda 750 perkinelmer america the other was the temperature distribution on the upper surface of pu cb fas sponge using a solar simulator and an infrared thermographic camera 2 4 performance test the pu cb fas sponge was placed in the oil water mixture and the entire separation process was photoed using a digital camera in addition the saturation adsorption capacity q m of the pu cb fas sponge for different low viscosity oils and organic solvents was tested according to eq 1 16 1 qm m 1 m 0 m 0 in above expression m 0 and m 1 denoted the mass of the sponge before and after oil absorption respectively subsequently the cycling performance of the pu cb fas sponge was tested in the test the selected adsorption object was soybean oil the cycle number was 10 times and the method used was the squeeze method continuous oil water separation required the use of a peristaltic pump in the separation experiment an empty beaker and a pu cb fas sponge were connected to the pump s output and input respectively when the peristaltic pump worked the sponge was submerged into the oil water mixture as a result the oil would be pumped into the empty beaker in addition pu cb fas sponge could also be used as a filter material to separate oil water mixtures in this experiment the device used for filtration separation was a conical funnel and the separated mixture was xylene oil red stain water methyl blue stain following was the equation for calculating this sponge s separation flux f 17 2 f v s t where v represented the volume of xylene passing through the sponge in a certain time s represented the effective filtration area and t represented the time used for filtration moreover the separation efficiency η was expressed as the volume ratio of xylene before and after separation and it could be calculated as shown in eq 3 18 3 η v 1 v 0 100 in eq 3 v 0 and v 1 represented the volume of xylene before and after separation respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 microstructure essentially the macroscopic properties of a sponge depend on its microstructure the situation of cb nanoparticles loading on the sponge skeleton surface was observed by sem as shown in fig 2 a1 a3 the pu sponge had a three dimensional 3d porous network structure which provided a large oil storage space for the pu cb fas sponge fig 2 a2 and fig 2 a3 showed the high magnification sem images and it was observed that the pu sponge skeleton surface was very flat compared with the pu sponge the sem images shown in fig 2 b1 b3 could prove that the pu cb fas sponge skeleton was loaded with a large number of cb nanoparticles and these nanoparticles made the sponge skeleton significantly rougher in addition we could learn from the preparation of pu cb fas sponge that cb nanoparticles were loaded onto the sponge skeleton fig s1 showed the sem images of the pu cb sponge at different magnifications when these images were compared with the pu cb fas sponge s sem images it could be found that their structures were very similar indicating that the fas modification had no significant effect on the sponge s microscopic morphology the eds energy spectrum of pu cb fas sponge was shown in fig 2 c and fig 2 d which could initially indicate that the fas molecules had been successfully grafted onto the sponge backbone this reason was that in addition to the c n and o elements inherent to pu sponge there were also f and si elements associated with fas molecules in the sponge besides the reason why fas could successfully modify pu cb sponge was that the fluorine atoms in fas could react with hydroxyl oh or alcohol groups in pu sponge cb nanoparticles and polydopamine this could form a graft structure thus firmly linking the fas to the pu cb sponge xps was used to further analyze whether the fas molecules had been grafted onto the sponge backbone fig 3 a and fig 3 b showed the total xps elemental spectra of pu cb sponge and pu cb fas sponge respectively as could be seen from the figures c1s 283 18 ev o1s 531 23 ev and n1s 399 01 ev were able to be detected in both samples in contrast three new characteristic peaks of si2s 154 22 ev si2p 103 07 ev and f1s 688 13 ev were detected on the surface of pu cb fas sponge which further confirmed the successful grafting of fas molecules 19 fig 3 c and fig 3 d represented the c1s energy spectrum fitted curves for pu cb sponge and pu cb fas sponge respectively the results showed that two new characteristic peaks of cf2 cf2 290 98 ev and cf3 293 28 ev appeared on the sponge skeleton after fas molecular grafting 3 2 wettability in practical oil water separation high requirement for material wettability was needed so the wettability of pu cb fas sponge before and after modification was studied 20 the pu cb fas sponge before fluorination modification was called pu cb sponge and fig 4 a showed its wettability drops of water methyl blue stained were placed on the cross section of the pu cb sponge and it was tested to have a water contact angle of 0 exhibiting superhydrophilicity then oil drops oil red stained were dropped on the cross section of pu cb sponge and it was found that the oil drops were also quickly adsorbed showing the sponge s lipophilicity the reason for superhydrophilicity was that the cb nanoparticle loading improved the roughness of the sponge skeleton but the overall still showed hydrophilicity due to the polydopamine layer s hydrophilicity 21 therefore a low surface energy substance fas was used to fluorinate the polydopamine layer and backbone on the pu cb sponge surface as shown in fig 4 b the pu cb fas sponge obtained superhydrophobicity through the rough structure constructed by cb nanoparticles and the low surface energy modification by fas and its water contact angle could reach 151 a material can be called superhydrophobic when its water contact angle is greater than or equal to 150 as shown in fig 4 c the pu cb sponge and pu cb fas sponge were placed in a beaker filled with water a few minutes later it was found that the pu cb sponge sank below the water surface while the pu cb fas sponge remained floating on the water surface subsequently the pu cb fas sponge was forced to be submerged in water using tweezers as shown in fig 4 d it was obvious to see the silver surface phenomenon on the sponge surface that was because the superhydrophobic surface of the sponge could not be wetted by water 22 in the following the effect of different fas concentrations on the hydrophobicity of pu cb fas sponges was investigated the correspondence between the sponge s water contact angle and fas concentration was shown in fig 4 e and it could be found that the pu cb fas sponge exhibited hydrophobicity when the fas concentration was greater than 1 mg ml 1 additionally it could also be observed that the pu cb fas sponge possessed superhydrophobicity until the fas concentration was increased to 3 mg ml 1 the reason for the above phenomenon was that with the grafting of low surface energy substances in the sponge skeleton the surface energy of the sponge surface gradually decreased as a result the sponge s hydrophobicity gradually increased until it reached the level of superhydrophobicity next the water contact angle of the sponge did not change significantly when the fas concentration continued to increase therefore we considered the sponge s raw material cost and hydrophobicity and regarded 3 mg ml 1 as the ideal fas concentration for pu cb fas sponge 3 3 adsorption properties of low viscosity oils pu cb fas sponge has been proven to be superhydrophobic and superlipophilic and consequently is expected to achieve excellent oil water separation fig 5 a and movie s1 showed the adsorption process of pu cb fas sponge on soybean oil oil red stain floating on the water surface it could be found that the sponge might absorb oil quickly and the oil droplets on the water surface would disappear completely after the adsorption was finished fig 5 b and movie s2 showed the process of adsorption of ccl4 oil red stained by pu cb fas sponge from this process it was found that once the ccl4 droplets were touched by the sponge they would be adsorbed clean within seconds these selective adsorption processes sufficiently demonstrated pu cb fas sponge s efficient oil water selective separation capability pu cb fas sponge has been proven to be superhydrophobic and superlipophilic and consequently is expected to achieve excellent oil water separation fig 5 a and movie s1 showed the adsorption process of pu cb fas sponge on soybean oil oil red stain floating on the water surface it could be found that the sponge might absorb oil quickly and the oil droplets on the water surface would disappear completely after the adsorption was finished fig 5 b and movie s2 showed the process of adsorption of ccl4 oil red stained by pu cb fas sponge from this process it was found that once the ccl4 droplets were touched by the sponge they would be adsorbed clean within seconds these selective adsorption processes sufficiently demonstrated pu cb fas sponge s efficient oil water selective separation capability the adsorption performance of pu cb fas sponge on some common low viscosity oils was studied imminently fig 5 c demonstrated pu cb fas sponge s saturation adsorption capacity for xylene dichloromethane ccl4 n hexane soybean oil pump oil and gasoline it could be found that the q m value was between 27 11 g g 1 and 59 96 g g 1 the saturation adsorption capacity of pu cb fas sponge had a great advantage compared with other related literature such as 6 5 44 5 g g 1 for tpu rgo monolith 13 8 28 2 g g 1 for chitosan cellulose aerogel and 8 5 20 g g 1 for pdms mwnts sponge 23 25 in practical oil water separation applications the recycling performance determines an adsorbent material s service life therefore the cycle stability of pu cb fas sponge was tested using the adsorption squeeze method as shown in fig 5 d we tested the cyclic adsorption performance of pu cb sponge and pu cb fas sponge on soybean oil the result showed that after 10 cycles the saturation adsorption capacity of pu cb sponge and pu cb fas sponge on soybean oil became 86 and 90 of the initial values respectively it was noteworthy that the sponges saturation adsorption capacity decreased slightly at the second cycle and the q m value remained slightly changed in the subsequent cycles the reason why the q m value dropped at the beginning was that after the first cycle of testing there would be some soybean oil adhering to the sponge skeleton however the amount of soybean oil which could not be removed was basically fixed so the subsequent q m values did not change much besides it could be also seen the q m values of pu cb fas sponge increased by more than 50 in each cycle compared to pu cb sponge this was because the sponge would have more hydrophobic groups on its surface after the low surface energy modification by fas as a result the sponge became more hydrophobic and had a corresponding increase in oil adsorption capacity another reason for this result was that the fas low surface energy modification reduced the force between the sponge and water thus decreasing the surface tension this led to a more lipophilic sponge surface which would also improve its oil adsorption property the internal insets showed the water contact angles of the pu cb fas sponge after 1 and 10 cycles of soybean oil absorption their results were 138 and 132 respectively although the sponge s hydrophobicity was reduced it still showed high hydrophobicity there were two main reasons for the decrease in hydrophobicity one reason was that the soybean oil remaining inside the sponge would occupy part of the sponge surface nanostructure gaps thus destroying the original superhydrophobic structure and leading to a decrease in hydrophobicity the other was that soybean oil might penetrate into the internal pores of the pu cb fas sponge thus disturbing the void structure and reducing the sponge s hydrophobicity fig s2 showed the compressive stress strain curves of pu cb fas sponge before and after the cyclic test it could be seen that the maximum compressive deformation of the sponge before and after the cyclic test was 85 5 and 95 respectively the compressive stress started to increase rapidly at 75 and 85 strain respectively the maximum stress was 0 708 mpa and 0 256 mpa respectively a conclusion could be drew that the pu cb fas sponge had stronger compressibility after the cyclic test this was due to the fact that the soybean oil acted as a lubricant during the compression process thus reducing friction therefore the compression process of pu cb fas sponge after cyclic oil absorption required less stress 3 4 oil water separation with a pump or filter studies have shown that it is a novel and effective method to continuously separate oil water mixtures with a pump assisted device 26 28 therefore this paper investigated the continuous oil water separation performance of pu cb fas sponge which was connected to a peristaltic pump the system was made up by a pu cb fas sponge a catheter and a peristaltic pump and the whole continuous separation process was shown in fig 6 a at the beginning the sponge was placed into the xylene oil red stained water mixture when the peristaltic pump started working xylene would be pumped into the empty beaker on the left a few seconds later the separation method could be proved to be feasible because no visible water droplets were found in the collected xylene such a convenient separation method makes the pu cb fas sponge has the ability to quickly deal with offshore oil spill incidents in the following the gravity driven oil water separation process was also investigated as shown in fig 6 b when the xylene oil red stain water methyl blue stain mixture was poured into a conical funnel stuffed with a pu cb fas sponge the water was completely retained in the conical funnel while the xylene flowed rapidly into the beaker below therefore it can be concluded that pu cb fas sponges can also be used as a filter material to separate oil water mixture effectively subsequently the xylene water mixture was tested for 5 separate cycles fig 6 c showed the separation flux and separation efficiency of each cycle separation and they were calculated by eq 2 and eq 3 respectively it was found that the separation efficiency was constantly above 98 8 and the separation flux was never lower than 99 713 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 during the 5 cycles above result showed that the prepared superhydrophobic pu cb fas sponge also had excellent cycling performance when it was used as a filter material 3 5 photothermal conversion property and crude oil adsorption property cb nanoparticles have strong light absorption ability and excellent photothermal conversion efficiency so we speculate that their loading will improve the sponge s light absorption ability and photothermal conversion efficiency significantly fig 7 a showed the spectral absorption capacity of the pu sponge and the pu cb fas sponge compared with pu sponge pu cb fas sponge significantly improved its light absorption capacity in the full solar spectrum average spectral absorption capacity of up to 101 subsequently the photothermal conversion efficiencies of pu sponge and pu cb fas sponge were investigated with the aid of a solar simulator and an infrared thermal imaging camera at a light power density of 1 sun 1 0 kw m2 the upper surface temperatures of pu sponge and pu cb fas sponge at different times were shown in fig 7 b it could be observed that the pu cb fas sponge s upper surface could rise from room temperature to 98 63 c in 120 s while the pu sponge s upper surface could only rise to 34 42 c at the same time fig 7 c and fig 7 d showed the temperature distribution on the pu sponge and pu cb fas sponge upper surface at different moments respectively these results were consistent with those in fig 7 b the main reason was that the cb nanoparticles attached to the pu cb fas sponge skeleton could make the sponge have excellent light absorption and photo thermal conversion ability therefore the sponge could convert sunlight into heat energy by its photothermal conversion mechanism which led to an increase in surface temperature 29 30 at a light power density of 1 sun the pu cb fas sponge s upper surface could rise to 98 63 c therefore it was necessary to test the pu cb fas sponge s thermal stability to ensure that it could withstand prolonged light heating fig s3 showed the thermogravimetric analysis tga curve of pu cb fas sponge it could be seen from the figure that the sample only started to decompose when the temperature reached 220 c it was sufficient to prove that the pu cb fas sponge could withstand the strong light environment for a long time table 1 listed numerous adsorbent materials that had been reported in recent years from this table it could be observed that the performance of pu cb fas sponge had performed very well by combining the three indices of wettability adsorption capacity and maximum temperature at the light intensity of 1 0 kw m2 indicating that our study had made progress based on previous studies the stability of photothermal conversion is of great value for pu cb fas sponge in practical applications fig 8 a showed the surface temperature change of pu cb fas sponge under the condition of 5 successive light on light off cycles the results showed that once the solar simulator was turned on the pu cb fas sponge s upper surface could rapidly increase to 85 c within 20 s after 100 s the temperature gradually stabilized showing fluctuations back and forth around 100 c after turning off the light the pu cb fas sponge s upper surface quickly returned to room temperature showing excellent photothermal responsiveness as the pu cb fas sponge maintained excellent photothermal conversion stability under the condition of 5 consecutive light on light off cycles it showed a great application in the crude oil recycling adsorption fig 8 b showed the viscosity of crude oil at different temperatures overall the viscosity of crude oil decreased with the temperature increased at 20 c the viscosity of crude oil was 61 481 5 mpa s while the viscosity decreased to 166 8 mpa s when the temperature increased to 100 c pu fas sponge was prepared by modifying pu sponge with fas directly to highlight the role of cb nanoparticles as shown in fig s4 we compared the penetration process of crude oil on the upper surface of pu fas sponge and pu cb fas sponge in fig s4 a it was observed that the high viscosity crude oil was unable to penetrate into the pu fas sponge even after 60 min at room temperature while in the same case the crude oil had almost completely penetrated into the pu cb fas sponge fig s4 b showed that at 1 sun power density 1 0 kw m2 the crude oil could penetrate into the pu cb fas sponge within 60 s due to the excellent photothermal conversion performance of the pu cb fas sponge on the contrary the state of crude oil on the surface of pu fas sponge did not undergo any change this experiment demonstrated that the loading of cb nanoparticles on the pu sponge skeleton played a crucial role in the rapid adsorption of high viscosity crude oil by the sponge this is mainly attributed to the strong photothermal conversion performance of cb nanoparticles since the pu fas sponge does not contain any material related to photothermal conversion it does not have the conditions to achieve rapid adsorption of crude oil by means of light heating next a pu cb fas sponge was put in a crude oil water mixture to simulate its adsorption of crude oil at sea as shown in fig 8 c the rate of crude oil adsorption by the pu cb fas sponge was slow under the no light condition after 15 min of adsorption the crude oil adsorbed by the sponge was squeezed onto a glass dish and weighed the results showed that only 0 06 g of crude oil was adsorbed into the sponge correspondingly fig 8 d showed the pu cb fas sponge s adsorption capacity on crude oil at a light power density of 1 sun 1 0 kw m2 the results showed that the pu cb fas sponge could adsorb 0 92 g of crude oil in 15 min and it had increased its adsorption capacity up to 15 times such a large performance improvement made the pu cb fas sponge promising as a new adsorbent material for handling crude oil spills 4 conclusion in conclusion this study prepared superhydrophobic pu cb fas sponge with excellent photothermal effect by loading cb nanoparticles and modifying low surface energy substances on the pu sponge s skeleton surface the following conclusions were drawn by studying the sponge s microscopic morphology wettability oil water separation performance photothermal conversion performance and adsorption performance on crude oil under light 1 the microscopic morphology of the pu cb fas sponge revealed that the sponge skeleton was loaded with a large number of cb nanoparticles and its surface roughness was greatly improved in addition the optimal fas modification concentration of pu cb fas sponge was determined to be 3 mg ml 1 at which the water contact angle of pu cb fas sponge could reach 151 2 pu cb fas sponge could be used as adsorbent material for oil water mixture separation it had a saturation capacity of 27 11 59 96 g g 1 for low viscosity oil or organic solvents such as soybean oil in addition pu cb fas sponge could also be used for oil water mixture separation with the help of a filtration device or peristaltic pump 3 pu cb fas sponge had excellent photothermal conversion performance at a light power density of 1 sun 1 0 kw m2 the upper surface of the sponge could be warmed up to 98 63 c within 120 s in addition the adsorption capacity of pu cb fas sponge under this light was 15 times higher than that without light the following are the supplementary data related to this

12427,in recent years spills of petroleum and organic chemicals have frequently occurred during their transportation at sea which has caused serious pollution for water resources in view of this a superhydrophobic pu cb fas sponge with excellent photothermal conversion performance was prepared and its microscopic morphology and wettability were investigated in this paper the results showed that the skeleton of pu cb fas sponge was covered with a layer of cb nanoparticles and elements such as f and si were found on the skeleton surface subsequently the water contact angle of the pu cb fas sponge was measured to be 151 and the sponge was able to separate oil water mixtures in different ways when the sponge was used as an adsorbent material its saturation capacity was 27 11 59 96 g g 1 for low viscosity oils organic solvents such as soybean oil finally the pu cb fas sponge s photothermal conversion performance was investigated at a light power density of 1 sun 1 0 kw m2 and the sponge s adsorption capacity for crude oil was increased by 15 times compared with the condition of without light thus the pu cb fas sponge successfully achieved rapid oil water separation and adsorption for high viscosity crude oil showing a broad practical application prospect graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords carbon black superhydrophobic oil water separation polyurethane sponge photothermal conversion data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction as an important natural resource petroleum has greatly improved the quality of human life but spills often occur during the exploration and transportation of petroleum this not only causes the waste of valuable resources but also seriously harms the ecology of the ocean 1 2 traditional methods for treating oil pollution mainly include electrochemical method flotation centrifugation filtration gravity separation and in situ combustion if these methods are applied in the field they generally have disadvantages such as cumbersome operation high price and low separation efficiency in recent years the adsorption method has been recognized the best solution for oil spill incidents because of its simple operation and environmental friendliness 3 as inspired by natural superhydrophobic phenomena scientists have developed a variety of porous adsorbent materials with special wettability such materials used to treat oily wastewater can be a good solution to solve the problems of traditional methods however untreated oil is usually characterized by high viscosity and low mobility as a result adsorbent materials exhibit poor adsorption performance when they were applied to offshore oil spill situations 4 5 at present researchers mainly focused on improving the adsorbent materials adsorption performance on crude oil by reducing the crude oil s viscosity 6 7 gong et al designed an mxene coated polyurethane sponge ti3c2t x pu 8 when a voltage was applied to this sponge the viscosity of the crude oil decreased along with the generation of joule heat therefore the sponge could use its capillary force to adsorb low viscosity crude oil in this way high viscosity crude oil would be cleaned although this electric heating method can achieve the purpose of cleaning crude oil it still has the disadvantages of high cost complicated to operate and can only be applied near the coast 9 11 solar energy is the most abundant and clean energy source on our planet it would be ideal if solar energy could be used to power an oil spill wang et al designed a thermoplastic polyurethane tpu porous monolith with reduced graphene oxide encapsulation and fluoroalkylsilane modification 12 the monolith exhibited an excellent photothermal effect and could continuously absorb crude oil by connecting a vacuum pump habibi et al prepared a photothermal pu mwcnt bnf ar sponge with good thermal resistance superhydrophobicity and superhydrophilicity by dip coating method 32 the surface temperature of this sponge could rise to 94 2 c under 1 sun power density 1 0 kw m2 the heat generated by light heating could reduce the viscosity of crude oil from 5800 mpa s to 48 4 mpa s which helped the sponge to absorb crude oil qin et al prepared a solar driven cellulose sponge pbzrgos by immobilizing reduced graphene oxide rgo on the backbone of a cellulose sponge using polybenzoxazine pbz as a binder 33 under the irradiation of 1 sun power density 1 0 kw m2 pbzrgos could rapidly absorb crude oil on the water surface within 140 s its adsorption capacity of crude oil was 15 7 times higher than that in the absence of light yang et al prepared janus sponges by deposition method using polydopamine tio2 and melamine formaldehyde ms sponges as raw materials 34 under 1 sun power density 1 0 kw m2 the bottom surface temperature of the janus sponge increased to 70 c in 10 min and 6 μl of crude oil could be adsorbed in 6 s however although the use of solar energy could significantly reduce the operational cost of adsorbing crude oil most of the adsorbent materials researchers have developed still suffer from high preparation costs 13 15 therefore the development of adsorbent materials with both low raw cost and excellent photothermal effect is of great value in dealing with large scale oil spills carbon black cb has natural black property and good light absorbing property in the entire solar spectrum besides cb has the advantages of large specific surface area and wide source which is widely used in photothermal conversion 31 compared with the other loadings of the photothermal adsorption materials mentioned above such as ti3c2tx go rgo mwcnt and tio2 the price of cb is at least tens of times cheaper so far there are few studies regarding cb in oil water separation and crude oil adsorption problems if cb nanoparticles and porous materials can be combined the cost of crude oil adsorption would be greatly saved among many porous materials commercial polyurethane pu sponge has been a research focus with many advantages such as low cost good mechanical properties and high porosity in view of this we tried to find a reliable method that could combine cb nanoparticles and pu sponge together because if they are not firmly bonded a very serious problem of slagging would occur dopamine is an important component of the mucus secreted by organisms such as marine mussels in tris solution at ph 8 5 it can undergo self polymerization reaction to generate polydopamine coating and the amine and carboxyl groups in polydopamine can chemically react with functional groups such as hydroxyl and carboxyl groups on the surface of cb nanoparticles these chemical reactions can bind the polydopamine tightly on the surface of cb nanoparticles thus making cb fixed on the pu sponge skeleton notably it has been demonstrated that cb nanoparticles can be deposited on pu sponge skeletons by the adhesion of polydopamine for example huang et al used dopamine to form polydopamine by self polymerization in a slightly alkaline solution 35 they prepared sponge sensors by adhering cb nanoparticles and graphene nanosheets to polyurethane sponges through the adhesion effect of polydopamine in this study superhydrophobic pu cb fas sponge with photothermal effect was prepared by dip coating method using low cost pu sponge cb nanoparticles and fluorinated silane coupling agent fas among the raw materials low surface energy substances fas were used to fluorinate the sponge skeleton to improve the sponge s hydrophobicity this work focused on pu cb fas sponge s microscopic morphology adsorption performance on low viscosity oil photothermal conversion performance and adsorption performance on high viscosity crude oil in addition the variation pattern between the concentration of fas and the wettability of pu cb fas sponge was also tightly studied this newly developed pu cb fas sponge provides an excellent adsorption material for cleaning up oil spill 2 experiment 2 1 materials pu sponge was purchased from dongguan jereh polymer material co tris hydroxymethyl aminomethane and trimethoxy 1h 1h 2h 2h

preparation process of pu cb fas sponge was shown in fig 1 a first 200 mg cb nanoparticles was added to 50 ml tris buffer solution 0 1 mol l 1 ph 8 5 and sonicated for 1 h then 150 mg dopamine hydrochloride was dissolved into above suspension subsequently the pu sponge was submerged in the solution and stirred for 12 h after stirring the sponge was removed and cleaned with deionized water this purpose was to remove the cb nanoparticles that were not firmly adhered to the sponge skeleton next the dried pu cb sponge was submerged in 50 ml ethanol solution containing different concentrations of fas molecules 0 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 mg ml 1 and continued to stir for 12 h finally the sponge was dried again to produce the last pu cb fas sponge fig 1 b showed the comparison of the pu sponge and pu cb fas sponge s real picture it could be seen that after the loading of cb nanoparticles the sponge changed from light yellow color to black color when the pu cb fas sponge was cut in halves it could be clearly seen that its interior also showed a single black color therefore it initially proved that the cb nanoparticles were completely loaded on the sponge skeleton fig 1 c showed the compression recovery process of the pu cb fas sponge this process visually reflected the sponge s good compressibility and recoverability which provided a beneficial condition for recycled oil absorption 2 3 characterization scanning electron microscopy sigma 300 zeiss germany was used to observe the pu sponge and pu cb fas sponge s microscopic morphologies before observation the samples that were cut into 5 mm 5 mm size needed to be vacuum gold sprayed meanwhile the elements of pu cb fas sponge were analyzed using energy dispersive x ray spectrometry next the pu sponge and pu cb fas sponge were cut to 3 mm 3 mm and they were analyzed for elemental composition and valence bonding using an x ray photoelectron spectrometer k alpha thermo fisher english in addition the water oil contact angles of pu cb fas sponges with different fas concentrations were tested using a contact angle measuring instrument jc2000c1 shanghai zhongchen china a thermogravimetric analyzer tga 550 ta instruments america was used to test the thermal stability of pu cb fas sponge with a heating rate of 20 c min and a temperature range of 30 800 c there were two tests of sponges photothermal conversion performance one was the absorption capacity of pu sponge and pu cb fas sponge to light using a uv vis spectrophotometer lambda 750 perkinelmer america the other was the temperature distribution on the upper surface of pu cb fas sponge using a solar simulator and an infrared thermographic camera 2 4 performance test the pu cb fas sponge was placed in the oil water mixture and the entire separation process was photoed using a digital camera in addition the saturation adsorption capacity q m of the pu cb fas sponge for different low viscosity oils and organic solvents was tested according to eq 1 16 1 qm m 1 m 0 m 0 in above expression m 0 and m 1 denoted the mass of the sponge before and after oil absorption respectively subsequently the cycling performance of the pu cb fas sponge was tested in the test the selected adsorption object was soybean oil the cycle number was 10 times and the method used was the squeeze method continuous oil water separation required the use of a peristaltic pump in the separation experiment an empty beaker and a pu cb fas sponge were connected to the pump s output and input respectively when the peristaltic pump worked the sponge was submerged into the oil water mixture as a result the oil would be pumped into the empty beaker in addition pu cb fas sponge could also be used as a filter material to separate oil water mixtures in this experiment the device used for filtration separation was a conical funnel and the separated mixture was xylene oil red stain water methyl blue stain following was the equation for calculating this sponge s separation flux f 17 2 f v s t where v represented the volume of xylene passing through the sponge in a certain time s represented the effective filtration area and t represented the time used for filtration moreover the separation efficiency η was expressed as the volume ratio of xylene before and after separation and it could be calculated as shown in eq 3 18 3 η v 1 v 0 100 in eq 3 v 0 and v 1 represented the volume of xylene before and after separation respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 microstructure essentially the macroscopic properties of a sponge depend on its microstructure the situation of cb nanoparticles loading on the sponge skeleton surface was observed by sem as shown in fig 2 a1 a3 the pu sponge had a three dimensional 3d porous network structure which provided a large oil storage space for the pu cb fas sponge fig 2 a2 and fig 2 a3 showed the high magnification sem images and it was observed that the pu sponge skeleton surface was very flat compared with the pu sponge the sem images shown in fig 2 b1 b3 could prove that the pu cb fas sponge skeleton was loaded with a large number of cb nanoparticles and these nanoparticles made the sponge skeleton significantly rougher in addition we could learn from the preparation of pu cb fas sponge that cb nanoparticles were loaded onto the sponge skeleton fig s1 showed the sem images of the pu cb sponge at different magnifications when these images were compared with the pu cb fas sponge s sem images it could be found that their structures were very similar indicating that the fas modification had no significant effect on the sponge s microscopic morphology the eds energy spectrum of pu cb fas sponge was shown in fig 2 c and fig 2 d which could initially indicate that the fas molecules had been successfully grafted onto the sponge backbone this reason was that in addition to the c n and o elements inherent to pu sponge there were also f and si elements associated with fas molecules in the sponge besides the reason why fas could successfully modify pu cb sponge was that the fluorine atoms in fas could react with hydroxyl oh or alcohol groups in pu sponge cb nanoparticles and polydopamine this could form a graft structure thus firmly linking the fas to the pu cb sponge xps was used to further analyze whether the fas molecules had been grafted onto the sponge backbone fig 3 a and fig 3 b showed the total xps elemental spectra of pu cb sponge and pu cb fas sponge respectively as could be seen from the figures c1s 283 18 ev o1s 531 23 ev and n1s 399 01 ev were able to be detected in both samples in contrast three new characteristic peaks of si2s 154 22 ev si2p 103 07 ev and f1s 688 13 ev were detected on the surface of pu cb fas sponge which further confirmed the successful grafting of fas molecules 19 fig 3 c and fig 3 d represented the c1s energy spectrum fitted curves for pu cb sponge and pu cb fas sponge respectively the results showed that two new characteristic peaks of cf2 cf2 290 98 ev and cf3 293 28 ev appeared on the sponge skeleton after fas molecular grafting 3 2 wettability in practical oil water separation high requirement for material wettability was needed so the wettability of pu cb fas sponge before and after modification was studied 20 the pu cb fas sponge before fluorination modification was called pu cb sponge and fig 4 a showed its wettability drops of water methyl blue stained were placed on the cross section of the pu cb sponge and it was tested to have a water contact angle of 0 exhibiting superhydrophilicity then oil drops oil red stained were dropped on the cross section of pu cb sponge and it was found that the oil drops were also quickly adsorbed showing the sponge s lipophilicity the reason for superhydrophilicity was that the cb nanoparticle loading improved the roughness of the sponge skeleton but the overall still showed hydrophilicity due to the polydopamine layer s hydrophilicity 21 therefore a low surface energy substance fas was used to fluorinate the polydopamine layer and backbone on the pu cb sponge surface as shown in fig 4 b the pu cb fas sponge obtained superhydrophobicity through the rough structure constructed by cb nanoparticles and the low surface energy modification by fas and its water contact angle could reach 151 a material can be called superhydrophobic when its water contact angle is greater than or equal to 150 as shown in fig 4 c the pu cb sponge and pu cb fas sponge were placed in a beaker filled with water a few minutes later it was found that the pu cb sponge sank below the water surface while the pu cb fas sponge remained floating on the water surface subsequently the pu cb fas sponge was forced to be submerged in water using tweezers as shown in fig 4 d it was obvious to see the silver surface phenomenon on the sponge surface that was because the superhydrophobic surface of the sponge could not be wetted by water 22 in the following the effect of different fas concentrations on the hydrophobicity of pu cb fas sponges was investigated the correspondence between the sponge s water contact angle and fas concentration was shown in fig 4 e and it could be found that the pu cb fas sponge exhibited hydrophobicity when the fas concentration was greater than 1 mg ml 1 additionally it could also be observed that the pu cb fas sponge possessed superhydrophobicity until the fas concentration was increased to 3 mg ml 1 the reason for the above phenomenon was that with the grafting of low surface energy substances in the sponge skeleton the surface energy of the sponge surface gradually decreased as a result the sponge s hydrophobicity gradually increased until it reached the level of superhydrophobicity next the water contact angle of the sponge did not change significantly when the fas concentration continued to increase therefore we considered the sponge s raw material cost and hydrophobicity and regarded 3 mg ml 1 as the ideal fas concentration for pu cb fas sponge 3 3 adsorption properties of low viscosity oils pu cb fas sponge has been proven to be superhydrophobic and superlipophilic and consequently is expected to achieve excellent oil water separation fig 5 a and movie s1 showed the adsorption process of pu cb fas sponge on soybean oil oil red stain floating on the water surface it could be found that the sponge might absorb oil quickly and the oil droplets on the water surface would disappear completely after the adsorption was finished fig 5 b and movie s2 showed the process of adsorption of ccl4 oil red stained by pu cb fas sponge from this process it was found that once the ccl4 droplets were touched by the sponge they would be adsorbed clean within seconds these selective adsorption processes sufficiently demonstrated pu cb fas sponge s efficient oil water selective separation capability pu cb fas sponge has been proven to be superhydrophobic and superlipophilic and consequently is expected to achieve excellent oil water separation fig 5 a and movie s1 showed the adsorption process of pu cb fas sponge on soybean oil oil red stain floating on the water surface it could be found that the sponge might absorb oil quickly and the oil droplets on the water surface would disappear completely after the adsorption was finished fig 5 b and movie s2 showed the process of adsorption of ccl4 oil red stained by pu cb fas sponge from this process it was found that once the ccl4 droplets were touched by the sponge they would be adsorbed clean within seconds these selective adsorption processes sufficiently demonstrated pu cb fas sponge s efficient oil water selective separation capability the adsorption performance of pu cb fas sponge on some common low viscosity oils was studied imminently fig 5 c demonstrated pu cb fas sponge s saturation adsorption capacity for xylene dichloromethane ccl4 n hexane soybean oil pump oil and gasoline it could be found that the q m value was between 27 11 g g 1 and 59 96 g g 1 the saturation adsorption capacity of pu cb fas sponge had a great advantage compared with other related literature such as 6 5 44 5 g g 1 for tpu rgo monolith 13 8 28 2 g g 1 for chitosan cellulose aerogel and 8 5 20 g g 1 for pdms mwnts sponge 23 25 in practical oil water separation applications the recycling performance determines an adsorbent material s service life therefore the cycle stability of pu cb fas sponge was tested using the adsorption squeeze method as shown in fig 5 d we tested the cyclic adsorption performance of pu cb sponge and pu cb fas sponge on soybean oil the result showed that after 10 cycles the saturation adsorption capacity of pu cb sponge and pu cb fas sponge on soybean oil became 86 and 90 of the initial values respectively it was noteworthy that the sponges saturation adsorption capacity decreased slightly at the second cycle and the q m value remained slightly changed in the subsequent cycles the reason why the q m value dropped at the beginning was that after the first cycle of testing there would be some soybean oil adhering to the sponge skeleton however the amount of soybean oil which could not be removed was basically fixed so the subsequent q m values did not change much besides it could be also seen the q m values of pu cb fas sponge increased by more than 50 in each cycle compared to pu cb sponge this was because the sponge would have more hydrophobic groups on its surface after the low surface energy modification by fas as a result the sponge became more hydrophobic and had a corresponding increase in oil adsorption capacity another reason for this result was that the fas low surface energy modification reduced the force between the sponge and water thus decreasing the surface tension this led to a more lipophilic sponge surface which would also improve its oil adsorption property the internal insets showed the water contact angles of the pu cb fas sponge after 1 and 10 cycles of soybean oil absorption their results were 138 and 132 respectively although the sponge s hydrophobicity was reduced it still showed high hydrophobicity there were two main reasons for the decrease in hydrophobicity one reason was that the soybean oil remaining inside the sponge would occupy part of the sponge surface nanostructure gaps thus destroying the original superhydrophobic structure and leading to a decrease in hydrophobicity the other was that soybean oil might penetrate into the internal pores of the pu cb fas sponge thus disturbing the void structure and reducing the sponge s hydrophobicity fig s2 showed the compressive stress strain curves of pu cb fas sponge before and after the cyclic test it could be seen that the maximum compressive deformation of the sponge before and after the cyclic test was 85 5 and 95 respectively the compressive stress started to increase rapidly at 75 and 85 strain respectively the maximum stress was 0 708 mpa and 0 256 mpa respectively a conclusion could be drew that the pu cb fas sponge had stronger compressibility after the cyclic test this was due to the fact that the soybean oil acted as a lubricant during the compression process thus reducing friction therefore the compression process of pu cb fas sponge after cyclic oil absorption required less stress 3 4 oil water separation with a pump or filter studies have shown that it is a novel and effective method to continuously separate oil water mixtures with a pump assisted device 26 28 therefore this paper investigated the continuous oil water separation performance of pu cb fas sponge which was connected to a peristaltic pump the system was made up by a pu cb fas sponge a catheter and a peristaltic pump and the whole continuous separation process was shown in fig 6 a at the beginning the sponge was placed into the xylene oil red stained water mixture when the peristaltic pump started working xylene would be pumped into the empty beaker on the left a few seconds later the separation method could be proved to be feasible because no visible water droplets were found in the collected xylene such a convenient separation method makes the pu cb fas sponge has the ability to quickly deal with offshore oil spill incidents in the following the gravity driven oil water separation process was also investigated as shown in fig 6 b when the xylene oil red stain water methyl blue stain mixture was poured into a conical funnel stuffed with a pu cb fas sponge the water was completely retained in the conical funnel while the xylene flowed rapidly into the beaker below therefore it can be concluded that pu cb fas sponges can also be used as a filter material to separate oil water mixture effectively subsequently the xylene water mixture was tested for 5 separate cycles fig 6 c showed the separation flux and separation efficiency of each cycle separation and they were calculated by eq 2 and eq 3 respectively it was found that the separation efficiency was constantly above 98 8 and the separation flux was never lower than 99 713 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 during the 5 cycles above result showed that the prepared superhydrophobic pu cb fas sponge also had excellent cycling performance when it was used as a filter material 3 5 photothermal conversion property and crude oil adsorption property cb nanoparticles have strong light absorption ability and excellent photothermal conversion efficiency so we speculate that their loading will improve the sponge s light absorption ability and photothermal conversion efficiency significantly fig 7 a showed the spectral absorption capacity of the pu sponge and the pu cb fas sponge compared with pu sponge pu cb fas sponge significantly improved its light absorption capacity in the full solar spectrum average spectral absorption capacity of up to 101 subsequently the photothermal conversion efficiencies of pu sponge and pu cb fas sponge were investigated with the aid of a solar simulator and an infrared thermal imaging camera at a light power density of 1 sun 1 0 kw m2 the upper surface temperatures of pu sponge and pu cb fas sponge at different times were shown in fig 7 b it could be observed that the pu cb fas sponge s upper surface could rise from room temperature to 98 63 c in 120 s while the pu sponge s upper surface could only rise to 34 42 c at the same time fig 7 c and fig 7 d showed the temperature distribution on the pu sponge and pu cb fas sponge upper surface at different moments respectively these results were consistent with those in fig 7 b the main reason was that the cb nanoparticles attached to the pu cb fas sponge skeleton could make the sponge have excellent light absorption and photo thermal conversion ability therefore the sponge could convert sunlight into heat energy by its photothermal conversion mechanism which led to an increase in surface temperature 29 30 at a light power density of 1 sun the pu cb fas sponge s upper surface could rise to 98 63 c therefore it was necessary to test the pu cb fas sponge s thermal stability to ensure that it could withstand prolonged light heating fig s3 showed the thermogravimetric analysis tga curve of pu cb fas sponge it could be seen from the figure that the sample only started to decompose when the temperature reached 220 c it was sufficient to prove that the pu cb fas sponge could withstand the strong light environment for a long time table 1 listed numerous adsorbent materials that had been reported in recent years from this table it could be observed that the performance of pu cb fas sponge had performed very well by combining the three indices of wettability adsorption capacity and maximum temperature at the light intensity of 1 0 kw m2 indicating that our study had made progress based on previous studies the stability of photothermal conversion is of great value for pu cb fas sponge in practical applications fig 8 a showed the surface temperature change of pu cb fas sponge under the condition of 5 successive light on light off cycles the results showed that once the solar simulator was turned on the pu cb fas sponge s upper surface could rapidly increase to 85 c within 20 s after 100 s the temperature gradually stabilized showing fluctuations back and forth around 100 c after turning off the light the pu cb fas sponge s upper surface quickly returned to room temperature showing excellent photothermal responsiveness as the pu cb fas sponge maintained excellent photothermal conversion stability under the condition of 5 consecutive light on light off cycles it showed a great application in the crude oil recycling adsorption fig 8 b showed the viscosity of crude oil at different temperatures overall the viscosity of crude oil decreased with the temperature increased at 20 c the viscosity of crude oil was 61 481 5 mpa s while the viscosity decreased to 166 8 mpa s when the temperature increased to 100 c pu fas sponge was prepared by modifying pu sponge with fas directly to highlight the role of cb nanoparticles as shown in fig s4 we compared the penetration process of crude oil on the upper surface of pu fas sponge and pu cb fas sponge in fig s4 a it was observed that the high viscosity crude oil was unable to penetrate into the pu fas sponge even after 60 min at room temperature while in the same case the crude oil had almost completely penetrated into the pu cb fas sponge fig s4 b showed that at 1 sun power density 1 0 kw m2 the crude oil could penetrate into the pu cb fas sponge within 60 s due to the excellent photothermal conversion performance of the pu cb fas sponge on the contrary the state of crude oil on the surface of pu fas sponge did not undergo any change this experiment demonstrated that the loading of cb nanoparticles on the pu sponge skeleton played a crucial role in the rapid adsorption of high viscosity crude oil by the sponge this is mainly attributed to the strong photothermal conversion performance of cb nanoparticles since the pu fas sponge does not contain any material related to photothermal conversion it does not have the conditions to achieve rapid adsorption of crude oil by means of light heating next a pu cb fas sponge was put in a crude oil water mixture to simulate its adsorption of crude oil at sea as shown in fig 8 c the rate of crude oil adsorption by the pu cb fas sponge was slow under the no light condition after 15 min of adsorption the crude oil adsorbed by the sponge was squeezed onto a glass dish and weighed the results showed that only 0 06 g of crude oil was adsorbed into the sponge correspondingly fig 8 d showed the pu cb fas sponge s adsorption capacity on crude oil at a light power density of 1 sun 1 0 kw m2 the results showed that the pu cb fas sponge could adsorb 0 92 g of crude oil in 15 min and it had increased its adsorption capacity up to 15 times such a large performance improvement made the pu cb fas sponge promising as a new adsorbent material for handling crude oil spills 4 conclusion in conclusion this study prepared superhydrophobic pu cb fas sponge with excellent photothermal effect by loading cb nanoparticles and modifying low surface energy substances on the pu sponge s skeleton surface the following conclusions were drawn by studying the sponge s microscopic morphology wettability oil water separation performance photothermal conversion performance and adsorption performance on crude oil under light 1 the microscopic morphology of the pu cb fas sponge revealed that the sponge skeleton was loaded with a large number of cb nanoparticles and its surface roughness was greatly improved in addition the optimal fas modification concentration of pu cb fas sponge was determined to be 3 mg ml 1 at which the water contact angle of pu cb fas sponge could reach 151 2 pu cb fas sponge could be used as adsorbent material for oil water mixture separation it had a saturation capacity of 27 11 59 96 g g 1 for low viscosity oil or organic solvents such as soybean oil in addition pu cb fas sponge could also be used for oil water mixture separation with the help of a filtration device or peristaltic pump 3 pu cb fas sponge had excellent photothermal conversion performance at a light power density of 1 sun 1 0 kw m2 the upper surface of the sponge could be warmed up to 98 63 c within 120 s in addition the adsorption capacity of pu cb fas sponge under this light was 15 times higher than that without light the following are the supplementary data related to this

author coagulation flocculation is currently the best practice for aquaculture effluent treatment and biobased compounds are emerging as coagulant flocculants this study aimed to characterize the bioflocculant produced from serratia marcescens and applied it to treat artificial turbid water kaolin substrate and real aquaculture effluent using the combination of one variable at a time ovat and response surface methodology rsm analyses the bioflocculant produced by s marcescens was characterized as anionic flocculant with isoelectric point at ph 1 7 and 13 3 at ph 7 its protein content was 1 3 μg ml and its total carbohydrate level was 0 53 mg l the bioflocculant consisted of various carboxylic acids and enzyme intermediates indicating the presence of polysaccharides and protein comparison of optimized treatment conditions between ovat and rsm showed that rapid mixing speed slow mixing time and sedimentation time were the most influential factors for coagulation flocculation the aquaculture effluent required lower rapid mixing speed 125 rpm and shorter sedimentation time 39 min than artificial wastewater 160 rpm and 67 min respectively the low performance of the bioflocculant in treating aquaculture effluent was due to the more complex characteristics of real aquaculture effluent compared with those of kaolin substrate environmental implications the characterization of bioflocculant produced by serratia marcescens in terms of its protein level total carbohydrate content and isoelectric point has never been reported the obtained results may provide an insight into the potential of this compound to substitute widely used chemical flocculants with reliable performance the findings may also be used as a basis to upscale coagulation flocculation from being applied to artificial wastewater in the laboratory to treating real wastewater especially with the use of biobased compounds graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords biocoagulant bioflocculant environmental pollution serratia marcescens wastewater treatment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction aquaculture is one of the sectors that contribute to surface water pollution 1 2 aquaculture effluent has high turbidity high organic content high suspended solid amount and a specific color 3 4 it also contains high levels of nutrients mainly nitrogen and phosphorus 5 6 these elements cause eutrophication when discharged into surface water without proper treatment 7 8 the current best practice in aquaculture effluent treatment is coagulation and flocculation 9 10 this technology was proven to be effective in treating most pollutant parameters in aquaculture effluents heiderscheidt et al 11 reported the high performance of poly aluminum chloride in removing up to 98 of turbidity suspended solids and phosphates from aquaculture effluents gibson et al 9 also demonstrated the successful treatment of suspended solids from aquaculture effluent using polyacrylamide pam polymers in addition to the type of coagulant several factors are influence the performance of coagulation flocculation ebeling et al 12 stated that the optimum dose of alum was 60 mg l for drinking water treatment jangkorn et al 13 mentioned that alum concentration of 400 mg l provided the best performance of wastewater treatment demirbas and kobya 14 stated that the optimum ph for aquaculture effluent treatment was ph 7 in addition rapid mixing slow mixing and sedimentation influence the performance of alum 15 some of the above factors also influence the overall performance of biocoagulants bioflocculants 16 17 chitosan shows the best performance at a dose of 0 5 g l rapid mixing speed of 100 rpm rapid mixing time of 15 min settling time of 20 min and ph 4 18 eggshell extract works optimally at a rapid mixing of 150 rpm for 2 min and a slow mixing of 30 rpm for 2 min 15 the highest performance of moringa oleifera can be achieved through optimization using response surface methodology rsm with a dose of 0 34 mg l ph 6 93 rapid mixing of 135 rpm for 13 52 min and sedimentation time for 113 15 min 19 optimization studies of coagulation flocculation conditions have been conducted for different types of chemical coagulants flocculants in addition reports on optimization for biobased coagulants flocculants are currently increasing however research on these materials is still limited to the types of plant and animal based compounds optimization for bacteria based bioflocculation especially that from s marcescens has never been attempted in addition studies comparing the performance of bioflocculants in treating artificial versus real wastewater are limited the current work aimed to analyze the characteristics bioflocculant produced by s marcescens and optimize the coagulation flocculation conditions to treat artificial wastewater kaolin substrate and real aquaculture effluent treatment comparison between the two types of wastewater was carried out through a two level test comprising one variable at a time ovat and rsm the results benefit the science of wastewater treatment especially in providing alternative biobased compounds to substitute currently used chemical based coagulants flocculants 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of artificial wastewater aquaculture effluent and bioflocculation two types of wastewaters were used artificial wastewater derived from kaolin substrate and real aquaculture effluent artificial wastewater was prepared by mixing 4 g of kaolin into 1 l of distilled water 20 a sample of aquaculture effluent with ph of 7 6 0 5 turbidity of 1112 250 ntu and total suspended solid tss of 582 125 mg l was obtained from freshwater fishpond

effluent for each experiment glass beakers pyrex usa with a volume of 500 ml filled with 200 ml a mixture of wastewater coagulant biocoagulant were used in the optimization test using ovat only turbidity was read because it represents the state of total pollutant initial parameter reading was performed a second after the mixing of the three compounds and final reading was conducted after the sedimentation time was over two types of wastewater namely artificial wastewater from kaolin substrate and aquaculture effluent were used these two types of wastewater were chosen to compare the performance of bioflocculant in treating wastewater that contains identified pollutants and real pollutants seven factors namely bioflocculant dose bioflocculant concentration rapid mixing speed rms and time rmt slow mixing speed sms and time smt and sedimentation time st were analyzed at this stage ph and temperature affecting the process were eliminated from the experiment because their evaluation require the use of energy and the addition of chemical compounds that could later have an influence when the wastewater is being reused in the aquaculture system turbidity removal was calculated using eq 1 the entire analysis was carried out using the jar test method 1 turbidity removal initial turbidity final turbidity initial turbidity 100 2 3 1 influence of bioflocculant dose ten variables namely doses of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and 10 of the total volume of the solution in the reactor were tested at this stage the dose of bioflocculant was adopted from literature s 20 30 31 dose is important in coagulation flocculation to provide enough particles for mechanism interaction 25 32 33 for each dose a ratio of 3 cacl2 to 2 bioflocculant was used for example for a bioflocculant dose of 1 3 ml cacl2 2 ml bioflocculant 195 ml wastewater were used the mixing sequence was performed by placing the wastewater first in a beaker followed by cacl2 and then the bioflocculant other factors were locked at the values of 1 mg l for bioflocculant concentration 150 rpm rms for 1 min 10 rpm sms for 10 min and st for 30 min the optimum dose was analyzed statistically and then locked in the next stage 2 3 2 influence of bioflocculant concentration the optimum biocoagulant dose was determined from previous ovat test results five variations were tested for bioflocculant concentration namely 1 10 100 1000 and 10 000 mg l the selected concentrations were based on previous studies and a log range was used to cover their extremely large differences 34 36 similar to dose the optimum concentration of the bioflocculant is required to facilitate the interaction mechanism 37 38 the dose of cacl2 used remains the same ratio with the factor of rms locked at 150 rpm for 1 min sms of 10 rpm for 10 min and st for 30 min the determination of the optimum bioflocculant concentration was done by statistical analysis 2 3 3 influence of rms four variations were selected to be tested at this stage which includes 100 150 200 and 250 rpm based on the capabilities of the tool and the results of previous research 39 41 rms is very important factor to provide sufficient contact for bioflocculants and dissolved solids in wastewater 42 43 the dose and concentration of the bioflocculant were locked at the optimum values while the rmt was locked at 1 min slow mixing at 10 rpm for 10 min and st at 30 min the determination of the results of the optimum rms in this experiment was done statistically 2 3 4 influence of rmt after the optimum speed of rapid mixing was determined as many as four variations 1 2 3 and 4 min of rmt were selected for testing 44 45 in addition to forceful collisions time is important to facilitate the collision 42 43 the dose and concentration of the bioflocculant and the rms were locked at their optimum values and the sms was set at 10 rpm for 10 min and st for 30 min statistical analysis was then applied to determine the optimum rmt 2 3 5 influence of sms at this stage the dose and concentration of the bioflocculant the speed and time of rapid mixing were locked in their optimum values the influence of sms which refers to the capabilities of the tool and the results of previous research 44 46 was analyzed using four variations namely 10 15 20 and 25 rpm sms is important in providing interaction between the microflocs that form into macroflocs 47 the optimum sms was determined by statistical analysis and then locked as the optimum condition in the next stage 2 3 6 influence of smt testing the influence of smt was carried out after previous factors had been optimized at this stage as many as 4 variations of 5 10 15 and 20 min are used in the analysis the determination of this variation was based on the results of previous research 18 44 48 sufficient time is required for the particles to form macroflocs thus a smt is very important in the flocculation process 49 the optimum smt was then also determined by statistical analysis 2 3 7 influence of st as the final stage of the ovat test as many as six variations of the st were selected for testing covering 15 30 45 60 120 and 180 min 50 51 optimum st is required to provide sufficient duration for macroflocs to settle 11 43 52 at this stage the dose and concentration of bioflocculant the speed and time of rapid mixing and the speed and time of slow mixing were locked at their optimum values the optimum st was then determined by statistical analysis 2 4 optimization of coagulation flocculation conditions using rsm analysis readings of turbidity tss and flocculating activities were carried out during rsm for the reading of flocculating activity a control in the form of wastewater cacl2 distilled water only with the same composition as the experimental reactor was used after the ovat test three factors were selected to be further analyzed as factors in rsm optimization these factors were chosen through a comparison of p values where a smaller value indicates a more significant influence 53 at this stage rsm was chosen because it can optimize and analyze interactions between factors meanwhile the box behnken design bbd was adopted because it can reduce the number of test reactors in addition the range to be applied was determined beforehand through the ovat test the rsm model with bbd was run with three responses namely turbidity removal eq 1 tss removal eq 2 and flocculating activity denoted in eq 3 as y1 y2 and y3 respectively tss concentration was determined using a spectrophotometer hach usa after the optimum conditions for all factors were determine a comparison was made between artificial wastewater and aquaculture effluent 2 tss removal initial tss final tss initial tss 100 3 flocculating activity final turbidity in control final turbidity final turbidity in control 100 2 5 statistical analysis statistical tests were performed to determine the optimum conditions for each factor in the ovat test all obtained data were tested for distribution homogeneity and independence and identified as parametric one way anova was conducted for each factor at a confidence interval of 95 α 5 significance was detected using p values and comparison of p values was applied to determine the most influential factors 53 a post hoc test was performed for the significant factor using tukey hsd analysis to determine the optimum condition in each factor for the rsm test the statistical analysis built into the model was used 3 results and discussion 3 1 bioflocculant characteristics 3 1 1 zeta potential the results of zeta potential protein content and total carbohydrate are shown in an isoelectric curve illustrated in fig 1 the bioflocculant produced by s marcescens was an anionic type of flocculant with ζ potential of 18 77 1 45 mv in ph 7 the charge of the obtained bioflocculant was negative although it was moderately negatively charged compared with other bioflocculants produced by bacteria enterobacter sp eth 2 produces bioflocculants with a charge of 28 7 8 23 mv 54 bacillus amyloliquefaciens dt produces bioflocculants with a zeta potential of 33 67 0 90 mv 55 and bacillus licheniformis produces bioflocculants with a charge of 48 3 mv 56 kaolin substrate and aquaculture effluent have a ph range of 6 8 57 so the zeta potential results in this range were further discussed as shown in fig 1 the isoelectric point of the bioflocculant was at ph 1 7 and 13 3 therefore its working mechanism changes in systems with ph 1 7 or 13 3 because it has a positive charge at these ph levels for other ph ranges the bioflocculant shows a negative charge so it works as an anionic flocculant such as for kaolin substrate and aquaculture effluent most anionic flocculants work through bridging and patching mechanisms when applied to systems that also have a negative charge 1 58 bridging facilitates agglomeration by entangling the particles into a large matrix 59 and patching facilitates agglomeration by providing pin connection like interaction between particles to form large sized ones 60 the bioflocculant can work through different mechanisms most probably via charge neutralization on acid mine wastewater which has a highly acidic ph 61 or tannery wastewater which has a highly alkaline ph 62 63 because of the opposite charge between particles and the bioflocculant 3 1 2 protein content the standard curve for protein content can be found in supplementary materials fig s1 as shown in fig 1 the protein content in the bioflocculant produced by s marcescens increased with the ph at neutral ph ph 7 the measured protein content was 1 3 μg ml the highest protein content of 2 4 μg ml was obtained at ph 14 the increase in protein content was observed because the solubility of proteins increases with the ph sharma et al 64 tested protein solubility at ph 4 to 10 and found an increase in protein content from 5 to 82 singh et al 65 also noted an increase in protein content from ph 5 5 3 5 mg ml to ph 8 4 2 mg ml at neutral ph proteins can contribute to flocculation through a bridging mechanism in which they act as high molecular weight compounds at base ph they can contribute to coagulation through a sweep mechanism due to deprotonation 66 3 1 3 total carbohydrates the standard curve for total carbohydrate content is shown in fig s2 as illustrated in fig 1 the amount of total carbohydrates decreased when the ph was close to neutral and then increased again at base ph the highest total carbohydrate content of 0 58 mg l was obtained at ph 14 and the lowest content of 0 47 mg l was obtained at ph 6 hameed et al 67 stated that total carbohydrate content tends to decrease at near neutral ph and increase again at base ph carbohydrates can contribute to coagulation or flocculation as surface active compounds or high molecular weight particles 68 3 1 4 organic compounds the gc ms spectrum is shown in fig 2 and the lc ms spectrum is displayed in fig 3 a summary of the compound readings can be found in tables 1 and 2 gc ms readings revealed four dominant compounds in the bioflocculant one alcohol based compound and three carboxylic acid based compounds the existence of alcohol may also contribute to the negative charge of the bioflocculant tyagi et al 69 mentioned that sitosterol acetate is one of the compounds in extracellular polymeric substance eps produced by parapedobacter sp istm3 ali et al 70 stated that hexadecanoic acid is the main content of eps produced by pseudomonas aeruginosa li et al 71 mentioned that acetic acid is the main compound of eps produced by agrobacterium sp m 503 and bafana 72 also reported that galacturonic acid can be found in eps produced by chlamydomonas reinhardtii similar to the gc ms readings lc ms results showed the presence of compounds based on carboxylic acids peak numbers 112 and 157 bacterial eps is a mixture of polysaccharides proteins and nucleic acids its carboxylic acid content can indicate its polysaccharide content 73 carboxylic acid is an intermediate compound for sugar degradation and also the result of fermentation or enzymatic reactions 74 other compounds detected by lc ms were degradation metabolites or intermediate compounds which also constituted the protein content in bioflocculants for example the compound with peak number 33 is part of an enzyme that refers to a catabolism reaction pubchem mesh d004798 the compound with peak number 47 is also part of an enzyme that catalyzes molecular assembly pubchem mesh d013930 all detected compounds are intermediate compounds that have a low molecular weight 75 however high molecular weight compounds such as sugars and proteins might have been present but not detected the readings of these organic compounds can support previous readings about the presence of proteins and polysaccharides and their characterization into specific compounds feng et al 76 and guo et al 77 mentioned that a high molecular weight compound can provide a strong bridging action for pollutant particles and facilitate agglomeration via bridging mechanisms 3 2 ovat analysis 3 2 1 influence of bioflocculant dose the results of the influence of bioflocculant dose on the treatment of artificial wastewater can be found in fig 4a significant difference in removal was found under doses of 1 4 and 5 p 0 05 insignificant differences were observed among the other doses 5 up to 10 this finding indicated that increasing the bioflocculant dose beyond 5 can no longer provide a significant impact on the agglomeration process the removal value decreased at doses of 7 79 4 72 and 8 79 16 5 24 compared with that at a dose of 5 79 2 2 32 showing that the optimum dose of bioflocculant was 5 further increasing the dose of bioflocculant will not improve and can even decrease the performance of turbidity removal because the non interacting bioflocculant will remain as suspended compounds that can increase turbidity 78 excess dosage can also cause a repulsive force that appears due to excess charge similarity and can reduce the performance of turbidity removal 12 47 similar results were obtained for the influence of bioflocculant dosage on the treatment of aquaculture effluent fig 4b increasing the dose up to 5 had a significant impact on the removal of turbidity p 0 05 turbidity removal of 73 77 1 88 was obtained at a dose of 5 but increasing the dose up to 10 showed a removal of 74 15 2 96 the use of an excessive dose of bioflocculant does not have a positive impact on turbidity removal and can even lower the performance because the residues of the bioflocculant failing to interact actually contribute to the turbidity in the suspension 39 3 2 2 influence of bioflocculant concentration for bioflocculant concentration 10 mg l showed a significant influence on the treatment of artificial wastewater p 0 05 fig 5a no significant increase in turbidity removal was observed at concentrations higher than 10 mg l this finding indicated that 10 mg l was the optimum concentration that can produce turbidity removal of 79 2 3 46 further increasing the bioflocculant concentration beyond this value does not affect the removal because the particles present are enough to support the interaction mechanisms during flocculation 79 80 similar results were also obtained for aquaculture effluent treatment fig 5b the optimum concentration was found to be 10 mg l which showed a significant difference in turbidity removal compared with 1 mg l p 0 05 and an insignificant difference compared with 100 1000 and 10 000 mg l turbidity removal at the optimum concentration reached 71 98 5 14 and increasing the concentration to 10 000 mg l only lead to an increase of only 73 52 7 16 an increase in the concentration of bioflocculants can have an impact on the charge of the solution due to the addition of compounds 81 82 but the presence of excess charge can cause a repulsive force that has a negative impact on the removal of turbidity 60 83 in this research cacl2 was used as coagulant to facilitate the initial agglomeration of particles the substitution of cacl2 with a biocoagulant compound is highly suggested to provide a complete biobased treatment and to assess the performance of combined biocoagulant and bioflocculant in treating wastewater 3 2 3 influence of rms the variation of rms had a significant effect on the removal of turbidity p 0 05 for the treatment of artificial wastewater fig 6a variation of 150 rpm showed a significant difference in the removal of turbidity 82 8 4 4 compared with 100 rpm but not compared with 200 rpm a significant decrease was found at the rms of 250 rpm 73 65 11 65 this finding showed that the speed of 150 rpm was enough to facilitate the particles to collide in the system to form microflocs 84 increasing the speed up to 250 rpm even inhibits the formation of flocs caused by too much shear force 85 excessive shear force can break the bond between the thickener and the particles in the system thus lowering the coagulation flocculation performance 86 for the treatment of aquaculture effluent fig 6b the optimum rms was at 150 rpm which showed significant difference compared with 100 rpm p 0 05 and but not with 200 and 250 rpm the results were quite similar to those for the treatment of artificial wastewater where the optimum point was also found at an rms of 150 rpm 70 65 4 4 therefore 150 rpm can provide enough force for particles to collide further increasing the rms will not increase the performance of floc formation 85 3 2 4 influence of rmt the results of the influence of rmt on artificial wastewater treatment can be found in fig 7 no significant differences were found for each time variation and a decrease was found for turbidity removal performance turbidity removal performance was 83 85 6 49 for 1 min and 74 04 5 52 for 4 min this phenomenon may have occurred because the optimum rms had been applied and the collision between particles occurred without difficulty however a long rmt can break the agglomeration that have formed between particles 86 on the basis of these results an rmt of 1 min was chosen as the optimum condition because it provides the highest removal performance further increase in mixing time can lead to an increase in energy consumption rmt also did not have a significant impact on turbidity removal for aquaculture effluent treatment p 0 05 increasing rmt even decreased the turbidity removal performance fig 7b turbidity removal at 1 min of rmt reached 71 49 6 49 and increasing the time up to 4 min even resulted in a reduced turbidity removal of 60 18 5 52 this finding showed that the shearing force that occurred during coagulation flocculation at 4 min rmt was too much and caused a disconnection from the agglomeration that had occurred 87 3 2 5 influence of sms similar to the rmt the variation of the sms also did not have a significant impact on the removal of turbidity for artificial wastewater treatment p 0 05 fig 8a the turbidity removal was 86 41 6 49 at a speed of 10 rpm and decreased to 80 79 5 52 at a speed of 25 rpm therefore the sms of 10 rpm provides the optimum force for macrofloc formation increasing the value to 25 rpm provides too high shear force that can reduce the performance of turbidity removal 39 sms also did not have a significant impact on the removal of turbidity in aquaculture effluent treatment fig 8b optimum conditions were chosen at a sms of 10 rpm because increasing the speed did not provide a significant increase in removal turbidity removal reached 73 57 6 49 at a speed of 10 rpm and 74 11 5 52 at a speed of 25 rpm this finding showed that the speed of 10 rpm was sufficient for providing the force for the interaction between particles in the formation of macroflocs 78 3 2 6 influence of smt in testing the influence of smt for artificial wastewater treatment it was found that a time of 10 min had a significant impact as compared to 5 min p 0 05 while increasing the time up to 20 min even decreased the turbidity removal performance fig 9a the highest turbidity removal was 90 19 0 45 this shows that 5 min was not enough to facilitate the interaction between particles and that excessive time has a negative impact on the formation of flocs similar to the previous discussion that too much shear force can cause the interaction between particles to be broken which lowers the turbidity removal performance 39 the results of the influence of smt for aquaculture effluent treatment were similar to those for artificial wastewater where the optimum point was found at 10 min fig 9b the removal of turbidity was obtained as much as 71 59 1 22 obtained at optimum conditions smt has an influence on floc formation due to low gradient velocity conditions which can facilitate aggregation in floc formation 87 3 2 7 influence of st st has an important role in providing time for the flocs that have formed to settle a significant difference was found for the increase in st from 45 to 60 min for artificial wastewater treatment p 0 05 while the other results showed no significant difference fig 10a turbidity removal of 97 99 2 26 was obtained at optimum conditions while adding time up to 180 min only increased removal up to 98 85 1 9 this showed that the entire floc that can settle has managed to settle optimally within 60 min 43 88 referring to this result then 60 min was taken into account as the optimum st for artificial wastewater treatment the results of the influence of st for aquaculture effluent treatment can be seen in fig 10b in contrast to the ovat results for artificial wastewater the optimum st for aquaculture wastewater treatment was found to be 30 min adding time up to 180 min did not show a significant impact p 0 05 the shorter time indicates that the sedimentation speed for flocs in aquaculture wastewater was higher compared to artificial wastewater 89 90 the removal of turbidity at a st of 30 min was 79 60 8 02 while increasing the st up to 180 min only shows 83 86 2 8 3 3 ovat results the overall ovat results for artificial wastewater and aquaculture effluent showed similar outcomes that is the variations of bioflocculant dose and concentration rms smt and st induced significant difference in turbidity removal as summarized in table 3 according to the highest significance value based on the lowest p value 91 92 the three factors selected to be detailed further in rsm were rms smt and st the optimum conditions based on the results of ovat for the treatment of artificial wastewater were bioflocculant dose of 5 with a concentration of 10 mg l rms of 150 rpm for 1 min sms of 10 rpm for 10 min and st of 60 min with a turbidity removal of 97 99 2 26 for aquaculture effluent treatment the optimum conditions were bioflocculant dosage of 5 with a concentration of 10 mg l rms of 150 rpm for 1 min sms of 10 rpm for 10 min and st of 30 min with a turbidity removal of 79 60 8 02 3 4 optimization using rsm 3 4 1 optimization of artificial wastewater treatment conditions on the basis of the ovat results rsm was conducted with three factors namely rms smt and st the respective ranges used were 125 175 rpm for rms 7 5 12 5 min for smt and 50 70 min of st other factors were run under optimum conditions based on ovat seventeen reactors were suggested by bbd the results of the analysis for each response according to the run on rsm can be found in table 4 all data obtained were then run without transformation with y1 turbidity removal y2 tss removal and y3 flocculating activity rsm suggested the quadratic model to be fit with the results for all responses anova showed significant value for the selected model and nonsignificant values for lack of fit for turbidity removal the r 2 value was 0 9978 with difference between the adjusted r 2 and predicted r 2 at 0 025 for tss removal the r 2 value was 0 9872 with difference between the adjusted r 2 and predicted r 2 at 0 1406 for flocculating activity the r 2 value 0 9701 with the difference between the adjusted r 2 and predicted r 2 at 0 0688 according to the rsm criteria the selected model showed good results anova also showed that the factor of rms and smt did not have a significant influence on the flocculating activity meanwhile all other factors had a significant influence on the response for turbidity removal the interaction between the factor of rms and smt did not have a significant influence on the response for the response of tss removal and flocculating activity only the interaction between rms and settling time had a significant influence on the response the interaction between factors in the 3d models are shown in figs 11 13 the optimized equations obtained for turbidity removal y1 tss removal y2 and flocculating activity y3 referring to the quadratic model for artificial wastewater are expressed as eqs 4 to 6 4 y 1 99 44 1 0375 a 0 9875 b 3 9 c 0 125 ab 2 3 ac 0 9 bc 2 7075 a 2 2 5075 b 2 3 6325

conditions for the three factors were run under the criteria of rms in range smt in range st in range turbidity removal maximum tss removal maximum and flocculating activity maximum rsm suggested 100 solutions for the optimum conditions of artificial wastewater treatment and the one with the highest desirability of 1000 was chosen as shown in fig 14 as shown in fig 14 the optimum conditions obtained were rms of 160 865 rpm smt of 11 4688 min and settling time of 67 3273 these results were then summarized and rounded into a bioflocculant dose of 5 v v bioflocculant concentration of 10 mg l rapid mixing 160 rpm for 1 min slow mixing 10 rpm for 12 min and settling time 67 min a validation test was then performed in accordance with the summary results of the optimum conditions the findings showed that turbidity removal was 99 error 2 1 tss removal was 99 error 1 8 and flocculating activity was 72 8 error 11 7 ribardo and allen 93 stated that the error obtained from the maximum model was as much as 20 referring to the harrington function evaluation scale which still shows an acceptable and good value and represents exceptional quality and performance 3 4 2 optimization of aquaculture effluent treatment conditions on the basis of the ovat results for aquaculture effluent treatment rsm was carried out with three factors namely rms smt and st with the ranges of 125 175 rpm 7 5 12 5 min and 20 40 respectively seventeen reactors were suggested by bbd the analysis results for each response according to the run can be referred to in table 5 all obtained data were then run without transformation with the same criteria as rsm for artificial wastewater treatment rsm showed that turbidity removal and flocculating activity showed a good fit to quadratic model while the tss removal showed a good fit with a linear model because of the value of the lack of fit was still not significant the difference between the adjusted r 2 and the predicted r 2 was still below 0 2 after changing from linear to quadratic model and in order to obtain interactions between factors therefore the models were chosen to run with the quadratic model for all responses differences between models with other responses can cause differences in desirability during the optimization process 94 all models showed significant fit values with non significant value for lack of fit for turbidity removal an r 2 value of 0 9995 was obtained with a difference of adjusted r 2 and predicted r 2 of 0 0045 for the tss removal the r 2 value was 0 9318 with an adjusted r 2 and predicted r 2 difference of 0 0115 for flocculating activity the r 2 value was 0 8362 with the difference between the adjusted r 2 and predicted r 2 of 0 0685 according to the rsm criteria the whole model has a good fit anova revealed that the factor of rms and smt did not have a significant influence on tss removal and flocculating activity the interaction between rms and settling time did not have a significant influence on the turbidity removal while the interaction between all factors did not have a significant influence on the tss removal and flocculating activity the interaction between factors in the 3d models are shown in figs 15 17 as for the equations obtained for turbidity removal y1 tss removal y2 and flocculating activity y3 based on the quadratic model for aquaculture effluent treatment can be referred to eqs 7 9 7 y 1 79 56 0 8 a 0 225 b 5 15 c 0 55 ab 0 15 ac 1 25 bc 1 23 a 2 0 28 b 2 2 33 c 2 8 y 2 96 0 1 a 0 15 b 2 8 c 0 275 ab 0 075 a c 0 275 bc 0 0875 a 2 0 1375 b 2 0 5875 c 2 9 y 3

range smt in range st in range turbidity removal maximum tss removal maximum and flocculating activity maximum rsm suggested 20 solutions with the chosen highest desirability of 1000 can be referred to in fig 18 according to fig 18 the optimum conditions for aquaculture effluent treatment were obtained at rms of 125 8 rpm smt of 11 81 min settling time of 39 4 min which was then summarized and rounded into bioflocculant dose of 5 v v bioflocculant concentration of 10 mg l rms 125 rpm for 1 min sms 10 rpm for 12 min and st 39 min the validation test was then carried out referring to optimum conditions that have been summarized and rounded which resulted in turbidity removal of 80 1 error 3 5 tss removal of 92 2 error 6 3 and flocculating activity of 60 2 error 12 6 similar to the result obtained for artificial wastewater treatment the maximum error value obtained from the model was 20 which is based on the harrington function evaluation scale and the obtained error value in this research are acceptable and very good also represent exceptional quality and performance 93 3 5 juxtaposition of optimized coagulation flocculation conditions the optimum treatment conditions for artificial wastewater and aquaculture effluent are listed in table 6 rms and settling time exhibited difference and were higher for artificial wastewater than for aquaculture effluent this finding can be attributed to the characteristics of artificial wastewater its particles are fabricated suspended solids and tend to be smaller than those in aquaculture wastewater 95 96 as a result a relatively high speed is needed to facilitate collision between particles to obtain the same performance small particle sizes require a long time to settle so the required settling time for artificial wastewater was longer than that for aquaculture effluent 97 furthermore the bioflocculant treatment achieved lower performance of turbidity removal tss removal and flocculating activity for real aquaculture effluent than for artificial wastewater this finding was due to the more complex characteristics of aquaculture effluent compared with those of kaolin substrate that may have affected the removal mechanism during the treatment 98 3 6 future research directions in this work rsm showed exceptional performance in optimizing the treatment conditions for artificial and real aquaculture wastewater however some other optimization methods models may suggest different results such as artificial neural network ann 99 100 comparison of optimized conditions between rsm and ann would be an interesting topic 101 to enrich the knowledge on the optimization of wastewater treatment conditions the adsorption rate and affinities of the bioflocculant onto particles may also have a significant impact on the agglomeration processes 102 104 especially during rapid mixing slow mixing and sedimentation time analyzing the adsorption affinity may help elaborate the flocculation process using the bioflocculant and depict the flocculation mechanism 104 cost benefit analysis can be performed by juxtaposing both compounds to assess the viability of using this bioflocculant for wastewater treatment as a substitute for currently available compounds such as pam 105 economic feasibility analysis focusing on the overall cost effectiveness 106 while considering the social return of investment with environmental impact benefits may also be carried out 107 4 conclusion the use of biobased flocculant produced by s marcescens for the treatment of turbid water was proven to be feasible the performance of this bioflocculant in pollutant removal from aquaculture effluent was found to be considerably high zeta potential analysis revealed that the bioflocculant contains various carboxylic acid and shows anionic characteristics comparison between ovat and rsm analyses showed that rms smt and st played significant roles during the treatment optimization using bbd revealed that artificial wastewater requires 160 rpm of rms and aquaculture effluent requires only 125 rpm furthermore the required st is 67 min for artificial wastewater and only 39 min for aquaculture effluent

author coagulation flocculation is currently the best practice for aquaculture effluent treatment and biobased compounds are emerging as coagulant flocculants this study aimed to characterize the bioflocculant produced from serratia marcescens and applied it to treat artificial turbid water kaolin substrate and real aquaculture effluent using the combination of one variable at a time ovat and response surface methodology rsm analyses the bioflocculant produced by s marcescens was characterized as anionic flocculant with isoelectric point at ph 1 7 and 13 3 at ph 7 its protein content was 1 3 μg ml and its total carbohydrate level was 0 53 mg l the bioflocculant consisted of various carboxylic acids and enzyme intermediates indicating the presence of polysaccharides and protein comparison of optimized treatment conditions between ovat and rsm showed that rapid mixing speed slow mixing time and sedimentation time were the most influential factors for coagulation flocculation the aquaculture effluent required lower rapid mixing speed 125 rpm and shorter sedimentation time 39 min than artificial wastewater 160 rpm and 67 min respectively the low performance of the bioflocculant in treating aquaculture effluent was due to the more complex characteristics of real aquaculture effluent compared with those of kaolin substrate environmental implications the characterization of bioflocculant produced by serratia marcescens in terms of its protein level total carbohydrate content and isoelectric point has never been reported the obtained results may provide an insight into the potential of this compound to substitute widely used chemical flocculants with reliable performance the findings may also be used as a basis to upscale coagulation flocculation from being applied to artificial wastewater in the laboratory to treating real wastewater especially with the use of biobased compounds graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords biocoagulant bioflocculant environmental pollution serratia marcescens wastewater treatment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction aquaculture is one of the sectors that contribute to surface water pollution 1 2 aquaculture effluent has high turbidity high organic content high suspended solid amount and a specific color 3 4 it also contains high levels of nutrients mainly nitrogen and phosphorus 5 6 these elements cause eutrophication when discharged into surface water without proper treatment 7 8 the current best practice in aquaculture effluent treatment is coagulation and flocculation 9 10 this technology was proven to be effective in treating most pollutant parameters in aquaculture effluents heiderscheidt et al 11 reported the high performance of poly aluminum chloride in removing up to 98 of turbidity suspended solids and phosphates from aquaculture effluents gibson et al 9 also demonstrated the successful treatment of suspended solids from aquaculture effluent using polyacrylamide pam polymers in addition to the type of coagulant several factors are influence the performance of coagulation flocculation ebeling et al 12 stated that the optimum dose of alum was 60 mg l for drinking water treatment jangkorn et al 13 mentioned that alum concentration of 400 mg l provided the best performance of wastewater treatment demirbas and kobya 14 stated that the optimum ph for aquaculture effluent treatment was ph 7 in addition rapid mixing slow mixing and sedimentation influence the performance of alum 15 some of the above factors also influence the overall performance of biocoagulants bioflocculants 16 17 chitosan shows the best performance at a dose of 0 5 g l rapid mixing speed of 100 rpm rapid mixing time of 15 min settling time of 20 min and ph 4 18 eggshell extract works optimally at a rapid mixing of 150 rpm for 2 min and a slow mixing of 30 rpm for 2 min 15 the highest performance of moringa oleifera can be achieved through optimization using response surface methodology rsm with a dose of 0 34 mg l ph 6 93 rapid mixing of 135 rpm for 13 52 min and sedimentation time for 113 15 min 19 optimization studies of coagulation flocculation conditions have been conducted for different types of chemical coagulants flocculants in addition reports on optimization for biobased coagulants flocculants are currently increasing however research on these materials is still limited to the types of plant and animal based compounds optimization for bacteria based bioflocculation especially that from s marcescens has never been attempted in addition studies comparing the performance of bioflocculants in treating artificial versus real wastewater are limited the current work aimed to analyze the characteristics bioflocculant produced by s marcescens and optimize the coagulation flocculation conditions to treat artificial wastewater kaolin substrate and real aquaculture effluent treatment comparison between the two types of wastewater was carried out through a two level test comprising one variable at a time ovat and rsm the results benefit the science of wastewater treatment especially in providing alternative biobased compounds to substitute currently used chemical based coagulants flocculants 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of artificial wastewater aquaculture effluent and bioflocculation two types of wastewaters were used artificial wastewater derived from kaolin substrate and real aquaculture effluent artificial wastewater was prepared by mixing 4 g of kaolin into 1 l of distilled water 20 a sample of aquaculture effluent with ph of 7 6 0 5 turbidity of 1112 250 ntu and total suspended solid tss of 582 125 mg l was obtained from freshwater fishpond

prepared as a coagulant compound 2 2 characterization of bioflocculant the bioflocculant was characterized by its charge zeta potential and protein total carbohydrate and organic contents zeta potential was analyzed by using a zetasizer malvern instrument uk in brief 1 mg of bioflocculant powder was added into 10 ml of distilled water to obtain 100 mg l concentration the sample was then ph

charges were expressed in mv an isoelectric curve was drawn by plotting between the obtained charges and the ph of the solution the isoelectric point was then determined from the point where the ph shows a zeta potential of 0 mv 24 25 protein content was analyzed using the protein dye binding method 26 a protein standard curve was drawn by preparing seven dilutions of bovine serum albumin bsa with amount varying from 0 05 to 0 5 ml distilled water was added to each tube until 0 5 ml of volume was achieved afterward 2 5 ml of bradford reagent was introduced and the mixture was incubated on each tube for 5 min at room temperature until a blue solution appeared as a result of the formation of a protein dye complex under acid conditions the intensity of the blue color was measured with a uv spectrophotometer dr 6000 hach usa at 595 nm distilled water was used as control and given the same treatment total protein concentration was determined by mixing 0 5 ml of sample and 2 5 ml of bradford reagent and then quantifying the protein using a spectrophotometer the optical density od reading from the sample was then plotted in the protein standard curve to determine the protein content in the sample namely a solution comprising 1 mg of bioflocculant in 10 ml of distilled water the protein content was analyzed under ph 1 to 14 the readings of the protein content were then plotted in the isoelectric curve to obtain a comparison in various ph levels total carbohydrate levels were analyzed using the phenol and sulfuric acid method of swaroopanand et al 27 the total carbohydrate standard curve was drawn by preparing as many as 10 glucose standard solutions in 10 tubes 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 and 1 ml with a concentration of 0 1 mg ml each tube was then diluted to a volume of 1 ml in brief 1 ml of 5 phenol r m chemicals malaysia and 5 ml of 96 sulfuric acid r m chemicals malaysia were dropwise added to each tube which was then shaken so that the phenol and sulfuric acid were well mixed after 10 min all tubes were placed in a water bath at 25 c 30 c for 15 min distilled water 1 ml given the same treatment was prepared as control the optical density od of each tube was taken at a wavelength of 490 nm with a spectrophotometer and then plotted into a carbohydrate standard curve samples were prepared by mixing 1 mg of bioflocculant in 10 ml of distilled water afterward 0 2 ml of the solution was taken and treated with the above mentioned procedure the od reading from the sample was then plotted in the carbohydrate standard curve to determine the total carbohydrate content in the sample carbohydrate content was also analyzed under ph 1 to 14 the total carbohydrates readings were also plotted in the isoelectric curve to obtain a comparison of the total carbohydrate content in various ph levels gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms was used to analyze the composition of monosaccharides and the type of linkages in the polysaccharide chain 28 in brief 1 mg of bioflocculant was dissolved in 1 ml of acetone r m chemicals malaysia vortexed memert germany for 30 min and centrifuged memert germany at 5000 rpm for 15 min the supernatant was filtered using a 0 22 μm membrane whatman uk and the clear filtrate was placed in a gc vial for later reading gc ms analysis of samples 1 μl was carried out using an agilent 7890a

based on the pubchem database referencing ms and ms2 values 2 3 optimization of coagulation flocculation conditions using one variable at a time ovat analysis for artificial wastewater and aquaculture effluent for each experiment glass beakers pyrex usa with a volume of 500 ml filled with 200 ml a mixture of wastewater coagulant biocoagulant were used in the optimization test using ovat only turbidity was read because it represents the state of total pollutant initial parameter reading was performed a second after the mixing of the three compounds and final reading was conducted after the sedimentation time was over two types of wastewater namely artificial wastewater from kaolin substrate and aquaculture effluent were used these two types of wastewater were chosen to compare the performance of bioflocculant in treating wastewater that contains identified pollutants and real pollutants seven factors namely bioflocculant dose bioflocculant concentration rapid mixing speed rms and time rmt slow mixing speed sms and time smt and sedimentation time st were analyzed at this stage ph and temperature affecting the process were eliminated from the experiment because their evaluation require the use of energy and the addition of chemical compounds that could later have an influence when the wastewater is being reused in the aquaculture system turbidity removal was calculated using eq 1 the entire analysis was carried out using the jar test method 1 turbidity removal initial turbidity final turbidity initial turbidity 100 2 3 1 influence of bioflocculant dose ten variables namely doses of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and 10 of the total volume of the solution in the reactor were tested at this stage the dose of bioflocculant was adopted from literature s 20 30 31 dose is important in coagulation flocculation to provide enough particles for mechanism interaction 25 32 33 for each dose a ratio of 3 cacl2 to 2 bioflocculant was used for example for a bioflocculant dose of 1 3 ml cacl2 2 ml bioflocculant 195 ml wastewater were used the mixing sequence was performed by placing the wastewater first in a beaker followed by cacl2 and then the bioflocculant other factors were locked at the values of 1 mg l for bioflocculant concentration 150 rpm rms for 1 min 10 rpm sms for 10 min and st for 30 min the optimum dose was analyzed statistically and then locked in the next stage 2 3 2 influence of bioflocculant concentration the optimum biocoagulant dose was determined from previous ovat test results five variations were tested for bioflocculant concentration namely 1 10 100 1000 and 10 000 mg l the selected concentrations were based on previous studies and a log range was used to cover their extremely large differences 34 36 similar to dose the optimum concentration of the bioflocculant is required to facilitate the interaction mechanism 37 38 the dose of cacl2 used remains the same ratio with the factor of rms locked at 150 rpm for 1 min sms of 10 rpm for 10 min and st for 30 min the determination of the optimum bioflocculant concentration was done by statistical analysis 2 3 3 influence of rms four variations were selected to be tested at this stage which includes 100 150 200 and 250 rpm based on the capabilities of the tool and the results of previous research 39 41 rms is very important factor to provide sufficient contact for bioflocculants and dissolved solids in wastewater 42 43 the dose and concentration of the bioflocculant were locked at the optimum values while the rmt was locked at 1 min slow mixing at 10 rpm for 10 min and st at 30 min the determination of the results of the optimum rms in this experiment was done statistically 2 3 4 influence of rmt after the optimum speed of rapid mixing was determined as many as four variations 1 2 3 and 4 min of rmt were selected for testing 44 45 in addition to forceful collisions time is important to facilitate the collision 42 43 the dose and concentration of the bioflocculant and the rms were locked at their optimum values and the sms was set at 10 rpm for 10 min and st for 30 min statistical analysis was then applied to determine the optimum rmt 2 3 5 influence of sms at this stage the dose and concentration of the bioflocculant the speed and time of rapid mixing were locked in their optimum values the influence of sms which refers to the capabilities of the tool and the results of previous research 44 46 was analyzed using four variations namely 10 15 20 and 25 rpm sms is important in providing interaction between the microflocs that form into macroflocs 47 the optimum sms was determined by statistical analysis and then locked as the optimum condition in the next stage 2 3 6 influence of smt testing the influence of smt was carried out after previous factors had been optimized at this stage as many as 4 variations of 5 10 15 and 20 min are used in the analysis the determination of this variation was based on the results of previous research 18 44 48 sufficient time is required for the particles to form macroflocs thus a smt is very important in the flocculation process 49 the optimum smt was then also determined by statistical analysis 2 3 7 influence of st as the final stage of the ovat test as many as six variations of the st were selected for testing covering 15 30 45 60 120 and 180 min 50 51 optimum st is required to provide sufficient duration for macroflocs to settle 11 43 52 at this stage the dose and concentration of bioflocculant the speed and time of rapid mixing and the speed and time of slow mixing were locked at their optimum values the optimum st was then determined by statistical analysis 2 4 optimization of coagulation flocculation conditions using rsm analysis readings of turbidity tss and flocculating activities were carried out during rsm for the reading of flocculating activity a control in the form of wastewater cacl2 distilled water only with the same composition as the experimental reactor was used after the ovat test three factors were selected to be further analyzed as factors in rsm optimization these factors were chosen through a comparison of p values where a smaller value indicates a more significant influence 53 at this stage rsm was chosen because it can optimize and analyze interactions between factors meanwhile the box behnken design bbd was adopted because it can reduce the number of test reactors in addition the range to be applied was determined beforehand through the ovat test the rsm model with bbd was run with three responses namely turbidity removal eq 1 tss removal eq 2 and flocculating activity denoted in eq 3 as y1 y2 and y3 respectively tss concentration was determined using a spectrophotometer hach usa after the optimum conditions for all factors were determine a comparison was made between artificial wastewater and aquaculture effluent 2 tss removal initial tss final tss initial tss 100 3 flocculating activity final turbidity in control final turbidity final turbidity in control 100 2 5 statistical analysis statistical tests were performed to determine the optimum conditions for each factor in the ovat test all obtained data were tested for distribution homogeneity and independence and identified as parametric one way anova was conducted for each factor at a confidence interval of 95 α 5 significance was detected using p values and comparison of p values was applied to determine the most influential factors 53 a post hoc test was performed for the significant factor using tukey hsd analysis to determine the optimum condition in each factor for the rsm test the statistical analysis built into the model was used 3 results and discussion 3 1 bioflocculant characteristics 3 1 1 zeta potential the results of zeta potential protein content and total carbohydrate are shown in an isoelectric curve illustrated in fig 1 the bioflocculant produced by s marcescens was an anionic type of flocculant with ζ potential of 18 77 1 45 mv in ph 7 the charge of the obtained bioflocculant was negative although it was moderately negatively charged compared with other bioflocculants produced by bacteria enterobacter sp eth 2 produces bioflocculants with a charge of 28 7 8 23 mv 54 bacillus amyloliquefaciens dt produces bioflocculants with a zeta potential of 33 67 0 90 mv 55 and bacillus licheniformis produces bioflocculants with a charge of 48 3 mv 56 kaolin substrate and aquaculture effluent have a ph range of 6 8 57 so the zeta potential results in this range were further discussed as shown in fig 1 the isoelectric point of the bioflocculant was at ph 1 7 and 13 3 therefore its working mechanism changes in systems with ph 1 7 or 13 3 because it has a positive charge at these ph levels for other ph ranges the bioflocculant shows a negative charge so it works as an anionic flocculant such as for kaolin substrate and aquaculture effluent most anionic flocculants work through bridging and patching mechanisms when applied to systems that also have a negative charge 1 58 bridging facilitates agglomeration by entangling the particles into a large matrix 59 and patching facilitates agglomeration by providing pin connection like interaction between particles to form large sized ones 60 the bioflocculant can work through different mechanisms most probably via charge neutralization on acid mine wastewater which has a highly acidic ph 61 or tannery wastewater which has a highly alkaline ph 62 63 because of the opposite charge between particles and the bioflocculant 3 1 2 protein content the standard curve for protein content can be found in supplementary materials fig s1 as shown in fig 1 the protein content in the bioflocculant produced by s marcescens increased with the ph at neutral ph ph 7 the measured protein content was 1 3 μg ml the highest protein content of 2 4 μg ml was obtained at ph 14 the increase in protein content was observed because the solubility of proteins increases with the ph sharma et al 64 tested protein solubility at ph 4 to 10 and found an increase in protein content from 5 to 82 singh et al 65 also noted an increase in protein content from ph 5 5 3 5 mg ml to ph 8 4 2 mg ml at neutral ph proteins can contribute to flocculation through a bridging mechanism in which they act as high molecular weight compounds at base ph they can contribute to coagulation through a sweep mechanism due to deprotonation 66 3 1 3 total carbohydrates the standard curve for total carbohydrate content is shown in fig s2 as illustrated in fig 1 the amount of total carbohydrates decreased when the ph was close to neutral and then increased again at base ph the highest total carbohydrate content of 0 58 mg l was obtained at ph 14 and the lowest content of 0 47 mg l was obtained at ph 6 hameed et al 67 stated that total carbohydrate content tends to decrease at near neutral ph and increase again at base ph carbohydrates can contribute to coagulation or flocculation as surface active compounds or high molecular weight particles 68 3 1 4 organic compounds the gc ms spectrum is shown in fig 2 and the lc ms spectrum is displayed in fig 3 a summary of the compound readings can be found in tables 1 and 2 gc ms readings revealed four dominant compounds in the bioflocculant one alcohol based compound and three carboxylic acid based compounds the existence of alcohol may also contribute to the negative charge of the bioflocculant tyagi et al 69 mentioned that sitosterol acetate is one of the compounds in extracellular polymeric substance eps produced by parapedobacter sp istm3 ali et al 70 stated that hexadecanoic acid is the main content of eps produced by pseudomonas aeruginosa li et al 71 mentioned that acetic acid is the main compound of eps produced by agrobacterium sp m 503 and bafana 72 also reported that galacturonic acid can be found in eps produced by chlamydomonas reinhardtii similar to the gc ms readings lc ms results showed the presence of compounds based on carboxylic acids peak numbers 112 and 157 bacterial eps is a mixture of polysaccharides proteins and nucleic acids its carboxylic acid content can indicate its polysaccharide content 73 carboxylic acid is an intermediate compound for sugar degradation and also the result of fermentation or enzymatic reactions 74 other compounds detected by lc ms were degradation metabolites or intermediate compounds which also constituted the protein content in bioflocculants for example the compound with peak number 33 is part of an enzyme that refers to a catabolism reaction pubchem mesh d004798 the compound with peak number 47 is also part of an enzyme that catalyzes molecular assembly pubchem mesh d013930 all detected compounds are intermediate compounds that have a low molecular weight 75 however high molecular weight compounds such as sugars and proteins might have been present but not detected the readings of these organic compounds can support previous readings about the presence of proteins and polysaccharides and their characterization into specific compounds feng et al 76 and guo et al 77 mentioned that a high molecular weight compound can provide a strong bridging action for pollutant particles and facilitate agglomeration via bridging mechanisms 3 2 ovat analysis 3 2 1 influence of bioflocculant dose the results of the influence of bioflocculant dose on the treatment of artificial wastewater can be found in fig 4a significant difference in removal was found under doses of 1 4 and 5 p 0 05 insignificant differences were observed among the other doses 5 up to 10 this finding indicated that increasing the bioflocculant dose beyond 5 can no longer provide a significant impact on the agglomeration process the removal value decreased at doses of 7 79 4 72 and 8 79 16 5 24 compared with that at a dose of 5 79 2 2 32 showing that the optimum dose of bioflocculant was 5 further increasing the dose of bioflocculant will not improve and can even decrease the performance of turbidity removal because the non interacting bioflocculant will remain as suspended compounds that can increase turbidity 78 excess dosage can also cause a repulsive force that appears due to excess charge similarity and can reduce the performance of turbidity removal 12 47 similar results were obtained for the influence of bioflocculant dosage on the treatment of aquaculture effluent fig 4b increasing the dose up to 5 had a significant impact on the removal of turbidity p 0 05 turbidity removal of 73 77 1 88 was obtained at a dose of 5 but increasing the dose up to 10 showed a removal of 74 15 2 96 the use of an excessive dose of bioflocculant does not have a positive impact on turbidity removal and can even lower the performance because the residues of the bioflocculant failing to interact actually contribute to the turbidity in the suspension 39 3 2 2 influence of bioflocculant concentration for bioflocculant concentration 10 mg l showed a significant influence on the treatment of artificial wastewater p 0 05 fig 5a no significant increase in turbidity removal was observed at concentrations higher than 10 mg l this finding indicated that 10 mg l was the optimum concentration that can produce turbidity removal of 79 2 3 46 further increasing the bioflocculant concentration beyond this value does not affect the removal because the particles present are enough to support the interaction mechanisms during flocculation 79 80 similar results were also obtained for aquaculture effluent treatment fig 5b the optimum concentration was found to be 10 mg l which showed a significant difference in turbidity removal compared with 1 mg l p 0 05 and an insignificant difference compared with 100 1000 and 10 000 mg l turbidity removal at the optimum concentration reached 71 98 5 14 and increasing the concentration to 10 000 mg l only lead to an increase of only 73 52 7 16 an increase in the concentration of bioflocculants can have an impact on the charge of the solution due to the addition of compounds 81 82 but the presence of excess charge can cause a repulsive force that has a negative impact on the removal of turbidity 60 83 in this research cacl2 was used as coagulant to facilitate the initial agglomeration of particles the substitution of cacl2 with a biocoagulant compound is highly suggested to provide a complete biobased treatment and to assess the performance of combined biocoagulant and bioflocculant in treating wastewater 3 2 3 influence of rms the variation of rms had a significant effect on the removal of turbidity p 0 05 for the treatment of artificial wastewater fig 6a variation of 150 rpm showed a significant difference in the removal of turbidity 82 8 4 4 compared with 100 rpm but not compared with 200 rpm a significant decrease was found at the rms of 250 rpm 73 65 11 65 this finding showed that the speed of 150 rpm was enough to facilitate the particles to collide in the system to form microflocs 84 increasing the speed up to 250 rpm even inhibits the formation of flocs caused by too much shear force 85 excessive shear force can break the bond between the thickener and the particles in the system thus lowering the coagulation flocculation performance 86 for the treatment of aquaculture effluent fig 6b the optimum rms was at 150 rpm which showed significant difference compared with 100 rpm p 0 05 and but not with 200 and 250 rpm the results were quite similar to those for the treatment of artificial wastewater where the optimum point was also found at an rms of 150 rpm 70 65 4 4 therefore 150 rpm can provide enough force for particles to collide further increasing the rms will not increase the performance of floc formation 85 3 2 4 influence of rmt the results of the influence of rmt on artificial wastewater treatment can be found in fig 7 no significant differences were found for each time variation and a decrease was found for turbidity removal performance turbidity removal performance was 83 85 6 49 for 1 min and 74 04 5 52 for 4 min this phenomenon may have occurred because the optimum rms had been applied and the collision between particles occurred without difficulty however a long rmt can break the agglomeration that have formed between particles 86 on the basis of these results an rmt of 1 min was chosen as the optimum condition because it provides the highest removal performance further increase in mixing time can lead to an increase in energy consumption rmt also did not have a significant impact on turbidity removal for aquaculture effluent treatment p 0 05 increasing rmt even decreased the turbidity removal performance fig 7b turbidity removal at 1 min of rmt reached 71 49 6 49 and increasing the time up to 4 min even resulted in a reduced turbidity removal of 60 18 5 52 this finding showed that the shearing force that occurred during coagulation flocculation at 4 min rmt was too much and caused a disconnection from the agglomeration that had occurred 87 3 2 5 influence of sms similar to the rmt the variation of the sms also did not have a significant impact on the removal of turbidity for artificial wastewater treatment p 0 05 fig 8a the turbidity removal was 86 41 6 49 at a speed of 10 rpm and decreased to 80 79 5 52 at a speed of 25 rpm therefore the sms of 10 rpm provides the optimum force for macrofloc formation increasing the value to 25 rpm provides too high shear force that can reduce the performance of turbidity removal 39 sms also did not have a significant impact on the removal of turbidity in aquaculture effluent treatment fig 8b optimum conditions were chosen at a sms of 10 rpm because increasing the speed did not provide a significant increase in removal turbidity removal reached 73 57 6 49 at a speed of 10 rpm and 74 11 5 52 at a speed of 25 rpm this finding showed that the speed of 10 rpm was sufficient for providing the force for the interaction between particles in the formation of macroflocs 78 3 2 6 influence of smt in testing the influence of smt for artificial wastewater treatment it was found that a time of 10 min had a significant impact as compared to 5 min p 0 05 while increasing the time up to 20 min even decreased the turbidity removal performance fig 9a the highest turbidity removal was 90 19 0 45 this shows that 5 min was not enough to facilitate the interaction between particles and that excessive time has a negative impact on the formation of flocs similar to the previous discussion that too much shear force can cause the interaction between particles to be broken which lowers the turbidity removal performance 39 the results of the influence of smt for aquaculture effluent treatment were similar to those for artificial wastewater where the optimum point was found at 10 min fig 9b the removal of turbidity was obtained as much as 71 59 1 22 obtained at optimum conditions smt has an influence on floc formation due to low gradient velocity conditions which can facilitate aggregation in floc formation 87 3 2 7 influence of st st has an important role in providing time for the flocs that have formed to settle a significant difference was found for the increase in st from 45 to 60 min for artificial wastewater treatment p 0 05 while the other results showed no significant difference fig 10a turbidity removal of 97 99 2 26 was obtained at optimum conditions while adding time up to 180 min only increased removal up to 98 85 1 9 this showed that the entire floc that can settle has managed to settle optimally within 60 min 43 88 referring to this result then 60 min was taken into account as the optimum st for artificial wastewater treatment the results of the influence of st for aquaculture effluent treatment can be seen in fig 10b in contrast to the ovat results for artificial wastewater the optimum st for aquaculture wastewater treatment was found to be 30 min adding time up to 180 min did not show a significant impact p 0 05 the shorter time indicates that the sedimentation speed for flocs in aquaculture wastewater was higher compared to artificial wastewater 89 90 the removal of turbidity at a st of 30 min was 79 60 8 02 while increasing the st up to 180 min only shows 83 86 2 8 3 3 ovat results the overall ovat results for artificial wastewater and aquaculture effluent showed similar outcomes that is the variations of bioflocculant dose and concentration rms smt and st induced significant difference in turbidity removal as summarized in table 3 according to the highest significance value based on the lowest p value 91 92 the three factors selected to be detailed further in rsm were rms smt and st the optimum conditions based on the results of ovat for the treatment of artificial wastewater were bioflocculant dose of 5 with a concentration of 10 mg l rms of 150 rpm for 1 min sms of 10 rpm for 10 min and st of 60 min with a turbidity removal of 97 99 2 26 for aquaculture effluent treatment the optimum conditions were bioflocculant dosage of 5 with a concentration of 10 mg l rms of 150 rpm for 1 min sms of 10 rpm for 10 min and st of 30 min with a turbidity removal of 79 60 8 02 3 4 optimization using rsm 3 4 1 optimization of artificial wastewater treatment conditions on the basis of the ovat results rsm was conducted with three factors namely rms smt and st the respective ranges used were 125 175 rpm for rms 7 5 12 5 min for smt and 50 70 min of st other factors were run under optimum conditions based on ovat seventeen reactors were suggested by bbd the results of the analysis for each response according to the run on rsm can be found in table 4 all data obtained were then run without transformation with y1 turbidity removal y2 tss removal and y3 flocculating activity rsm suggested the quadratic model to be fit with the results for all responses anova showed significant value for the selected model and nonsignificant values for lack of fit for turbidity removal the r 2 value was 0 9978 with difference between the adjusted r 2 and predicted r 2 at 0 025 for tss removal the r 2 value was 0 9872 with difference between the adjusted r 2 and predicted r 2 at 0 1406 for flocculating activity the r 2 value 0 9701 with the difference between the adjusted r 2 and predicted r 2 at 0 0688 according to the rsm criteria the selected model showed good results anova also showed that the factor of rms and smt did not have a significant influence on the flocculating activity meanwhile all other factors had a significant influence on the response for turbidity removal the interaction between the factor of rms and smt did not have a significant influence on the response for the response of tss removal and flocculating activity only the interaction between rms and settling time had a significant influence on the response the interaction between factors in the 3d models are shown in figs 11 13 the optimized equations obtained for turbidity removal y1 tss removal y2 and flocculating activity y3 referring to the quadratic model for artificial wastewater are expressed as eqs 4 to 6 4 y 1 99 44 1 0375 a 0 9875 b 3 9 c 0 125 ab 2 3 ac 0 9 bc 2 7075 a 2 2 5075 b 2 3 6325

conditions for the three factors were run under the criteria of rms in range smt in range st in range turbidity removal maximum tss removal maximum and flocculating activity maximum rsm suggested 100 solutions for the optimum conditions of artificial wastewater treatment and the one with the highest desirability of 1000 was chosen as shown in fig 14 as shown in fig 14 the optimum conditions obtained were rms of 160 865 rpm smt of 11 4688 min and settling time of 67 3273 these results were then summarized and rounded into a bioflocculant dose of 5 v v bioflocculant concentration of 10 mg l rapid mixing 160 rpm for 1 min slow mixing 10 rpm for 12 min and settling time 67 min a validation test was then performed in accordance with the summary results of the optimum conditions the findings showed that turbidity removal was 99 error 2 1 tss removal was 99 error 1 8 and flocculating activity was 72 8 error 11 7 ribardo and allen 93 stated that the error obtained from the maximum model was as much as 20 referring to the harrington function evaluation scale which still shows an acceptable and good value and represents exceptional quality and performance 3 4 2 optimization of aquaculture effluent treatment conditions on the basis of the ovat results for aquaculture effluent treatment rsm was carried out with three factors namely rms smt and st with the ranges of 125 175 rpm 7 5 12 5 min and 20 40 respectively seventeen reactors were suggested by bbd the analysis results for each response according to the run can be referred to in table 5 all obtained data were then run without transformation with the same criteria as rsm for artificial wastewater treatment rsm showed that turbidity removal and flocculating activity showed a good fit to quadratic model while the tss removal showed a good fit with a linear model because of the value of the lack of fit was still not significant the difference between the adjusted r 2 and the predicted r 2 was still below 0 2 after changing from linear to quadratic model and in order to obtain interactions between factors therefore the models were chosen to run with the quadratic model for all responses differences between models with other responses can cause differences in desirability during the optimization process 94 all models showed significant fit values with non significant value for lack of fit for turbidity removal an r 2 value of 0 9995 was obtained with a difference of adjusted r 2 and predicted r 2 of 0 0045 for the tss removal the r 2 value was 0 9318 with an adjusted r 2 and predicted r 2 difference of 0 0115 for flocculating activity the r 2 value was 0 8362 with the difference between the adjusted r 2 and predicted r 2 of 0 0685 according to the rsm criteria the whole model has a good fit anova revealed that the factor of rms and smt did not have a significant influence on tss removal and flocculating activity the interaction between rms and settling time did not have a significant influence on the turbidity removal while the interaction between all factors did not have a significant influence on the tss removal and flocculating activity the interaction between factors in the 3d models are shown in figs 15 17 as for the equations obtained for turbidity removal y1 tss removal y2 and flocculating activity y3 based on the quadratic model for aquaculture effluent treatment can be referred to eqs 7 9 7 y 1 79 56 0 8 a 0 225 b 5 15 c 0 55 ab 0 15 ac 1 25 bc 1 23 a 2 0 28 b 2 2 33 c 2 8 y 2 96 0 1 a 0 15 b 2 8 c 0 275 ab 0 075 a c 0 275 bc 0 0875 a 2 0 1375 b 2 0 5875 c 2 9 y 3 68 58 0 025 a 0 0875 b 2 8125 c 0 775 ab 0 075 ac 0 15 bc 0 04 a 2 1 065 b 2 2 665 c 2 solutions for optimum conditions of aquaculture effluent treatment were constructed using the criteria of rms in range smt in range st in range turbidity removal maximum tss removal maximum and flocculating activity maximum rsm suggested 20 solutions with the chosen highest desirability of 1000 can be referred to in fig 18 according to fig 18 the optimum conditions for aquaculture effluent treatment were obtained at rms of 125 8 rpm smt of 11 81 min settling time of 39 4 min which was then summarized and rounded into bioflocculant dose of 5 v v bioflocculant concentration of 10 mg l rms 125 rpm for 1 min sms 10 rpm for 12 min and st 39 min the validation test was then carried out referring to optimum conditions that have been summarized and rounded which resulted in turbidity removal of 80 1 error 3 5 tss removal of 92 2 error 6 3 and flocculating activity of 60 2 error 12 6 similar to the result obtained for artificial wastewater treatment the maximum error value obtained from the model was 20 which is based on the harrington function evaluation scale and the obtained error value in this research are acceptable and very good also represent exceptional quality and performance 93 3 5 juxtaposition of optimized coagulation flocculation conditions the optimum treatment conditions for artificial wastewater and aquaculture effluent are listed in table 6 rms and settling time exhibited difference and were higher for artificial wastewater than for aquaculture effluent this finding can be attributed to the characteristics of artificial wastewater its particles are fabricated suspended solids and tend to be smaller than those in aquaculture wastewater 95 96 as a result a relatively high speed is needed to facilitate collision between particles to obtain the same performance small particle sizes require a long time to settle so the required settling time for artificial wastewater was longer than that for aquaculture effluent 97 furthermore the bioflocculant treatment achieved lower performance of turbidity removal tss removal and flocculating activity for real aquaculture effluent than for artificial wastewater this finding was due to the more complex characteristics of aquaculture effluent compared with those of kaolin substrate that may have affected the removal mechanism during the treatment 98 3 6 future research directions in this work rsm showed exceptional performance in optimizing the treatment conditions for artificial and real aquaculture wastewater however some other optimization methods models may suggest different results such as artificial neural network ann 99 100 comparison of optimized conditions between rsm and ann would be an interesting topic 101 to enrich the knowledge on the optimization of wastewater treatment conditions the adsorption rate and affinities of the bioflocculant onto particles may also have a significant impact on the agglomeration processes 102 104 especially during rapid mixing slow mixing and sedimentation time analyzing the adsorption affinity may help elaborate the flocculation process using the bioflocculant and depict the flocculation mechanism 104 cost benefit analysis can be performed by juxtaposing both compounds to assess the viability of using this bioflocculant for wastewater treatment as a substitute for currently available compounds such as pam 105 economic feasibility analysis focusing on the overall cost effectiveness 106 while considering the social return of investment with environmental impact benefits may also be carried out 107 4 conclusion the use of biobased flocculant produced by s marcescens for the treatment of turbid water was proven to be feasible the performance of this bioflocculant in pollutant removal from aquaculture effluent was found to be considerably high zeta potential analysis revealed that the bioflocculant contains various carboxylic acid and shows anionic characteristics comparison between ovat and rsm analyses showed that rms smt and st played significant roles during the treatment optimization using bbd revealed that artificial wastewater requires 160 rpm of rms and aquaculture effluent requires only 125 rpm furthermore the required st is 67 min for artificial wastewater and only 39 min for aquaculture effluent the lower treatment performance for aquaculture effluent compared with that for artificial wastewater was due to the complex characteristics of real wastewater that might have affected the removal

12429,a series of cofe ldhs mos2 x x 0 1 0 2 and 0 5 samples were successfully synthesized to activate peroxymonosulfate pms for tetracycline tc removal with the introduction of mos2 could promote the catalytic performance via accelerating the fe2 fe3 and co2 co3 cycle about 98 8 of tc could be removed over 12 min under a neutral condition in the cofe ldhs mos2 0 2 pms system which was 4 4 times higher than that of cofe ldhs pms system the main reactive oxygen species ros in cofe ldhs mos2 0 2 pms system were also explored by using quenching and free radical capture experiments the singlet oxygen 1o2 played a major role for the tc removal besides the decomposition pathways of tc were deduced by uplc qtof ms and the stability of catalysts had also been studied this work provided theoretical and experimental basis for designing and preparation more effective heterogeneous catalysts for pms activation keywords peroxymonosulfate hydrotalcite mos2 tetracycline pollutant control data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction most antibiotic drugs cannot be completely metabolized in human and animal bodies 1 up to 85 of antibiotics are excreted in their original form or as metabolites through feces and urine 2 after excretion they still have biological activity leading to the presence of antibiotics in natural environment drinking water and soil sediments 3 the residual and resistance genes may pose immeasurable threats to humans and ecosystems thus it is urgent to search a feasible antibiotic removal technology to solve the potential safety problems of antibiotics in water environment advanced oxidation technologies aops are reliable technologies for the oxidation removal of organic pollutants in recent years which has attracted wide attention of researchers 4 the formation of free radicals could selectively remove refractory pollutants in a short time 5 among numerous aops sulfate radical so4 based advanced oxidation processes display certain advantages including higher redox potential 2 5 3 1 ev longer lifetime t1 2 4 μs and wider working ph range 3 10 6 based on the production of enhanced free radicals large amount of catalysts have been developed to strengthen the activation process of pms among them the heterogeneous catalytic system could avoid secondary contamination compared with homogeneous catalytic system 7 metal oxide catalysts are the most common heterogeneous catalysts to activate pms in the field of sewage treatment meanwile the bimetallic oxides presented higher reaction activity and catalytic stability than monometallic catalysts 8 for exmaple the co fe oxides system showed an excellent catalytic ability for pollutants removal due to the cyclic reaction of cobalt and iron ions 9 however the agglomeration phenomenon of the metal oxide catalysts would be appeared during the preparation processes because of the high surface energy which would lead to lower catalytic performance 10 as a result it is necessary to find out novel catalysts for achieving stable and efficient pms activation capability layered double hydroxides including cobalt and iron cofe ldhs have attracted extensive attention in the field of aops due to their convenient preparation method and excellent surface properties 11 yan et al prepared a series of cofe ldhs nanosheets and direct activated pms for antibiotics removal which exhibited efficient and stable ciprofloxacin cip degradation capability 12 to improve the stability of the catalyst cofe ldhs was enhanced by loading biochar bc and the synergistic effect between bc and cofe ldhs promoted the electron transport for pms activation 13 jiang et al designed 3d flower like magnetic cofe ldhs cofe2o4 materials to degrade aniline an and the formed larger specific surface and pore sizes could strengthen the production of ros through pms activation 14 thus employing suitable catalyst carriers to improve pms dissociation is a promising method for the promoted wastewater removal molybdenum disulfide mos2 has been widespread applied in the field of catalytic processes due to its abundant reaction sites and excellent electron transfer rate 15 meanwhile mos2 could effective promote the circulation of transition metal ions in the fenton like system 16 wang et al reported that the fe iii would be quickly reduced to fe ii with the addition of mos2 resulting in enhancing the degradation of aqueous contaminants under the fe ii pms system 17 at the same time qu et al also found that the formed mo iv sites would activate pms for pollutants degradation and the s defect sites contributed to the adsorption of pms molecules 18 to further enhance the application range of mos2 we combined the advantages of cofe ldhs and mos2 to accelerate the electron transfer process for enhanced pms activation so as to improve the removal efficiency of pollutants in the present study cofe ldhs mos2 x samples were synthesized by using a hydrothermal method tetracycline tc was used as target pollutants to explore the catalytic performance via pms activation the as synthesized catalysts were detected the physical and chemical properties through xdr ftir sem and xps to analysis in addition the quenching tests and esr detections were applied to analyze the reactive oxygen species ros the degradation pathways of tc was also deduced by using uplc qtof ms 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals nh4 6mo7o24 4h2o ch4n2s co no3 2 6h2o fe no3 3 9h2o co nh2 2 and nh4f were purchased from tianjin damao company tetracycline tc peroxymonosulfate khso5 0 5khso4 0 5k2so4 and 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo were obtained from aladdin furfuryl alcohol ffa methanol meoh chloroform cf and tert butanol tba were obtained from tianjing fuyu fine chemicals co ltd the chemicals used were all analytically grade without further purification 2 2 preparation of cofe ldhs mos2 a certain amount of nh4 6mo7o24 4h2o and ch4n2s mo s 1 2 was dispersed into 40 ml deionized water under magnetic stirring afterwards the above solution was transferred to a 100 ml telfon lined autoclave and then kept at 180 c for 12 h to obtain mos2 the cofe ldhs mos2 x were synthesized via hydrothermal method stoichiometrics of co no3 2 6h2o fe no3 3 9h2o co nh2 2 nh4f and 0 2 g mos2 were mixed in 50 ml deionized water under ultrasonic condition 20 min the obtained mixture was transferred to a 100 ml telfon lined autoclave again which was heated at 100 c for 12 h after cooling to room temperature the samples were washed by water and ethanol for several times ultimately the collected samples were dried under vacuum at 50 c overnight the samples were named as cofe ldhs mos2 x and the x represented the ratios of mo fe were 0 1 0 2 and 0 5 2 3 catalytic performance the degradation experiments were conducted into a 250 ml reactor at room temperature containing 100 ml 50 mg l tetracycline then certain quantities of catalysts and pms were introduced into the beaker to start the experiment the initial ph value was adjusted by using hcl or naoh at certain intervals 4 0 ml sample was collected and then filtered by using 0 22 μm filter membrane and detected by using ultraviolet spectrophotometer at the wavelength of 357 nm for cyclic experiment the used catalyst was separated by filtration without washing and then carried out next cycle directly 2 4 characterization x ray diffraction xrd patterns were detected by using a d8 advance x ray diffractometer emitting cu kα radiation scanning electron microscopy sem was detected by zeiss sigma 500 x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps measurement was performed by thermo scientific k alpha with an al kα x ray gun the metal ion dissolution was measured by using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes nexion 350x perkin elmer the degradation products were determined by agilent 6545 quadrupole time of flight uplc qtof ms system electron spin resonance esr technology was analyzed by using a brucker a200 s 9 5 12 spectrometer fourier transform infrared spectra ftir were detected by perkin elmer spectrum gx 3 results and discussions 3 1 characterization the xrd patterns of prepared cofe ldhs mos2 0 2 cofe ldhs and mos2 samples are illustrated in fig 1a the peaks at 2θ 11 3 22 8 34 5 60 4 and 61 7 belonged to the 003 006 009 and 110 planes of cofe ldhs 19 and the above resluts were matched with pdf no 089 3040 then the peaks at 14 46 29 12 32 96 38 15 47 90 51 85 and 58 15 corresponded to the 003 006 101 104 107 018 and 110 planes of mos2 20 however the xrd patterns showed that the cofe ldhs mos2 0 2 was not obvious mos2 phase which may caused by a small amount of mos2 load in addition the surface properties of cofe ldhs mos2 0 2 cofe ldhs and mos2 samples were further detected by the ftir analysis from fig 1b the bands situated at 3422 cm 1 were attributed to the stretching of oh groups 12 for mos2 sample the bands at 484 904 950 and 1626 cm 1 were belonged to the stretching vibration of mos ss moo and moo 21 moreover the bands at 698 825 and 1500 cm 1 were attributed to coo feo and co stretching vibration 22 moreover a new adsorption bond at 1095 cm 1 may be assigned to m mo stretching vibrations which was consistent with the previously reported 23 24 thus the above investigation results concluded the successful synthesis of cofe ldhs mos2 nanocomposites the surface morphology of cofe ldhs mos2 0 2 cofe ldhs and mos2 samples are shown in fig 2 as described in fig 2a the sem image of cofe ldhs samples showed spherical structure with the smooth surface which was mainly caused by its relatively poor crystallinity fig 2b displayed the sem image of mos2 with the nanosheet structure however it can be clearly observed that when the mos2 was introuduced into the structure of the cofe ldhs samples the cofe ldhs gradually transformed into lamellar structure this phenomenon showed that the crystallinity of cofe ldhs increased the obatined results were accorded with the xrd detection in addition the cofe ldhs samples were loaded on the mos2 surface fig 2d thus the cofe ldhs mos2 samples were successful prepared through hydrothermal synthesis the xps analysis of cofe ldhs mos2 0 2 sample was investigated in fig 3 as displayed in fig 3a the xps full spectrum analysis displayed the existence of fe co mo s and o elements on the surface of cofe ldhs mos2 0 2 sample the fe 2p spectra was showed in fig 3b the binding energy at 711 3 ev was attributed to fe ii state and then the binding energy at 713 6 ev was belonged to fe iii state which would be conducive to the oxidation and reduction of fe state 25 27 from fig 3c the binding energy at 782 2 ev was assigned to co iii state while the binding energy at 780 8 ev was assigned to co ii state 28 from fig 3d the binding energy at 226 1 228 7 232 4 and 235 7 ev was belonged to s 2s mo iv mo iv and mo vi states 21 as displayed in fig 3e the bingding energy at 161 6 ev and 162 8 ev were s2 2p2 3 and s2 2p1 2 of mos2 then the binding energy at 168 9 ev was represented so4 2 which due to the partial oxidation of mos2 23 the binding energy located at 163 7 ev was the unsaturated edge s 29 the o 1s xps spectrum also discussed in fig 3f the binding energy at 531 9 ev and 531 0 ev were belonged to the lattice oxygen and surface hydroxyl group 30 3 2 degradation performance the catalytic activities of cofe ldhs mos2 x were discussed by the degradation of tc via pms activation as shown in fig 4a different catalysts were prepared to evaluate the activation ability of pms for tc removal the addition of mos2 in the system was ineffective to degrade tc which showed low activation capacity of pms in addition the degradation efficiency of tc by adding cofe ldhs mos2 0 2 alone was also negligible when adding the cofe ldhs in the system 79 2 of tc could be removed during the 12 min subsequently the mos2 was introuduced into the cofe ldhs structure to form the cofe ldhs mos2 0 1 samples the degradation efficiency increased to 98 1 withthin 12 min suggesting that the cofe ldhs mos2 0 2 presented a remarkably catalytic activity towards pms activation for tc removal with the increase of mos2 loaded 0 1 to 0 5 the degradation efficiency of tc raised to 98 8 and then decreased to 93 8 therefore we selected 0 2 to continue the subsequent experiment as reported in fig 4b the corresponding kinetic constant indicated that the activity order was cofe ldhs mos2 0 2 cofe ldhs mos2 0 1 cofe ldhs mos2 0 5 cofe ldhs with the k value of 0 2249 0 1569 0 0925 and 0 0586 min 1 respectively the results revealed that the cofe ldhs mos2 0 2 achieved 4 4 times superior activity than bulk cofe ldhs for tc removal 3 3 the effects of reaction parameters as demonstrated in fig 5a the influence of initial ph value on the removal of tc by using cofe ldhs mos2 0 2 pms displayed that lower ph conditions were unfavourable to the removal of tc 94 9 with the ph value increased to natural conditions 5 8 and 9 0 the degradation efficiency of tc enhanced to 98 8 and 98 3 respectively when ph was in strong alkaline 11 0 the degradation rate of tc decreased to 89 1 the alkaline environment could passivate the catalysts and improved the invalid decomposition of pms to reduce the catalytic activity in the system 31 the first order dynamic results were 0 1017 0 2249 0 2588 and 0 0962 min 1 the obtained results indicated that the cofe ldhs mos2 0 2 had high catalytic performance in a broad initial ph environment 3 0 11 0 the influence of catalysts dosage on the removal of tc was investigated in fig 5b there was obvious facilitation on the degradation of tc with the catalyst dosage increased from 0 05 g l to 0 2 g l it can be explained that large amount of catalysts would provide abundant active sites for pms activation 32 the corresponding kinetic constant of k value was 0 1059 0 2249 0 2227 and 0 2819 min 1 to avoid waste caused by adding too much catalyst we selected 0 1 g l of catalyst dosage to conduct the following test from fig 5c when the pms concentration increased from 0 25 to 1 0 mm the removal efficiency of tc increased seriously k 0 0680 0 0959 and 2249 min 1 which were due to the production of more ros with a increase of pms concentration 33 however the removal efficiency had slightly decreased with the pms concentration increased to 2 mm because more pms may quench ros to affect the removal of pollutants 34 the influence of initial pollutants concentration was discussed in fig 5d the removal efficiency of tc decreased with the initial tc concentration increased to 100 mg l this is mainly because the higher content of pollutants required more free radicals for tc degradation in summary we used the conditions of ph 5 8 catalyst dose 0 1 g l pms concentration 1 mm and tc concentraion 50 mg l for subsequent analysis 3 4 determination of ros in the cofe ldhs mos2 0 2 pms system the reactive oxygen species ros quenching measurements were used to determine the catalytic mechanism of the cofe ldhs mos2 0 2 pms system methanol was used to quench hydroxyl radical oh and sulfate radical so4 35 the tert butanol tba and chloroform cf are used to mainly suppress oh and o2 36 37 moreover furfuryl alcohol ffa is selected to quenched singlet oxygen 1o2 38 as shown in fig 6a when the cf and tba were introduced in the system the degradation rate of tc had little change suggesting that the oh and o2 were not the mian ros in the cofe ldhs mos2 0 2 pms system afterwards the degradation rate of tc decreased to 79 0 and 72 2 with the addition of 150 mm and 300 mm methanol which showed the existence of so4 in the system importantly ffa was introduced to determine the 1o2 with the concentration of ffa inceased from 5 mm to 20 mm the tc degradation rate was decreased form 51 7 to 31 0 it can be found that the 1o2 play a key role on the removal of tc as shown in fig s2 the corresponding calculated contribution ratios of different ros to tc removal rate were as follows 1o2 so4 oh o2 the esr analysis was also used to verify the ros in the cofe ldhs mos2 pms system as displayed in fig 6b the dmpo x signal could be detected with the addition of cofe ldhs mos2 0 2 while the dmpo oh was found with the cofe ldhs introduced this change may be due to the oxidation of dmpo through the so4 or oh in the system 39 40 thus the signal of so4 or oh in the cofe ldhs mos2 0 2 pms system was not obvious from fig 6c the cofe ldhs mos2 0 2 revealed the strongest signal of 1o2 which showed that the mos2 loading could enhance the reaction of non free radical this phenomenon can be explained that the mo vi could react with o2 to produce 1o2 29 in addition the o2 radicals capture experiments were carried out in fig 6d a o2 signal was discovered but the o2 was not the mian ros in the cofe ldhs mos2 0 2 system 3 5 degradation mechanism the spent cofe ldhs mos2 0 2 catalysts combination and valence change were detected by xps analysis to deduce the catalytic mechanism as shown in fig 7a the element composition still contains co fe s mo and o after catalytic reaction however the fe 2p xps results showed the relative proportion of fe ii increased to 58 5 as compared with the fresh cofe ldhs mos2 0 2 56 5 fig 7b the cocatalytic effect of mos2 realized iron ion conversion in the cofe ldh mos2 0 2 system eq 1 similar to the fe 2p the proportion of co ii increased to 60 9 fresh 47 9 and the co iii decreased to 39 1 fig 7c this could be explained that the cyclic reaction of co iii co ii and fe iii fe ii enhanced the proportion of co ii eq 2 1 mo4 fe3 mo6 fe2 2 co3 fe2 co2 fe3 as displayed in fig 7d there was no obvious change in the valence state of mo in the mo 3d xps spectrum which indicated that mo remained stable after catalytic reaction the phenomenon was mainly due to the redox of mo iv and mo vi during the process of pms activation 41 from fig 7e the valence state of the unsaturated edge s 163 7 ev did not change evidently suggesting that the s sites could be exposed in the system 42 the o 1s xps spectrum showed that the proportion of lattice oxygen enhanced after reaction suggesting that the lattice oxygen may be participated in the activation of pms to produce ros 43 44 based on the above discussion and analysis the possible ros generation mechanisms in the cofe ldhs mos2 pms system were shown in fig 8 3 6 degradation pathways of tc by cofe ldhs mos2 pms system the uplc qtof ms was used to deduce the possible degradation pathways of tc during the cofe ldhs mos2 0 2 pms process and the analysis results were showed in fig 9 then the main degradation intermediate were displayed in table s1 after oxidation process the m z 445 tc could be oxidized to the intermediate products of m z 417 and m z 474 via demethylation and carbonylation reaction 45 subsequently the intermediate product of m z 362 was formed by the attack of hydroxyl and cc bond 46 during the further oxidation and ring opening processes the intermediates of m z 149 and m z 122 were formed in addition the ros might attack the intermediates of m z 474 which would be produced the m z 274 and m z 279 the dehydroxylation demethylation and ring opening intermediate products of m z 220 and m z 156 were formed through oxidation reaction 47 ultimately all the intermediates m z 122 m z 146 and m z 90 were transformed to produce co2 and h2o 3 7 stability evaluation the regeneration and stability of heterogeneous catalyst are key factors herein the reusability of the cofe ldhs mos2 0 2 samples were discussed through cycle experiments in fig s1 during the four cycles of experiments the degradation efficiencies of tc presented a downward trend 95 2 70 8 54 4 and 45 4 respectively the catalyst exhibited showed certain catalytic stability and application potential and its degradation efficiency could still be remained above 50 after third cycle moreover the dissolving results of fe co and mo ions were also identified to estimate the catalysts stability from fig s1b the dissolved fe ion was 1 66 0 45 0 31 and 0 12 mg l then the dissolved co ion was 11 92 3 76 2 15 and 0 87 mg l finally the dissolved mo ion was 1 38 0 37 0 24 and 0 16 mg l in the final analysis we should further strengthen the catalysts stability and decrease the metal ions dissolution 4 conclusion in this work the cofe ldhs mos2 x samples were successfully synthesized by hydrothermal method the xrd ftir and sem results showed that cofe ldhs were loaded on the surface of mos2 nanosheets the removal rate of tc achieved at 98 8 within 12 min in the cofe ldhs mos2 0 2 pms process and the reaction kinetic constant was 4 4 times higher than those of pure cofe ldhs pms process the esr analysis and quenching results showed that 1o2 played a major role during the cofe ldhs mos2 0 2 pms system the xps analysis of the spent cofe ldhs mos2 0 2

12429,a series of cofe ldhs mos2 x x 0 1 0 2 and 0 5 samples were successfully synthesized to activate peroxymonosulfate pms for tetracycline tc removal with the introduction of mos2 could promote the catalytic performance via accelerating the fe2 fe3 and co2 co3 cycle about 98 8 of tc could be removed over 12 min under a neutral condition in the cofe ldhs mos2 0 2 pms system which was 4 4 times higher than that of cofe ldhs pms system the main reactive oxygen species ros in cofe ldhs mos2 0 2 pms system were also explored by using quenching and free radical capture experiments the singlet oxygen 1o2 played a major role for the tc removal besides the decomposition pathways of tc were deduced by uplc qtof ms and the stability of catalysts had also been studied this work provided theoretical and experimental basis for designing and preparation more effective heterogeneous catalysts for pms activation keywords peroxymonosulfate hydrotalcite mos2 tetracycline pollutant control data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction most antibiotic drugs cannot be completely metabolized in human and animal bodies 1 up to 85 of antibiotics are excreted in their original form or as metabolites through feces and urine 2 after excretion they still have biological activity leading to the presence of antibiotics in natural environment drinking water and soil sediments 3 the residual and resistance genes may pose immeasurable threats to humans and ecosystems thus it is urgent to search a feasible antibiotic removal technology to solve the potential safety problems of antibiotics in water environment advanced oxidation technologies aops are reliable technologies for the oxidation removal of organic pollutants in recent years which has attracted wide attention of researchers 4 the formation of free radicals could selectively remove refractory pollutants in a short time 5 among numerous aops sulfate radical so4 based advanced oxidation processes display certain advantages including higher redox potential 2 5 3 1 ev longer lifetime t1 2 4 μs and wider working ph range 3 10 6 based on the production of enhanced free radicals large amount of catalysts have been developed to strengthen the activation process of pms among them the heterogeneous catalytic system could avoid secondary contamination compared with homogeneous catalytic system 7 metal oxide catalysts are the most common heterogeneous catalysts to activate pms in the field of sewage treatment meanwile the bimetallic oxides presented higher reaction activity and catalytic stability than monometallic catalysts 8 for exmaple the co fe oxides system showed an excellent catalytic ability for pollutants removal due to the cyclic reaction of cobalt and iron ions 9 however the agglomeration phenomenon of the metal oxide catalysts would be appeared during the preparation processes because of the high surface energy which would lead to lower catalytic performance 10 as a result it is necessary to find out novel catalysts for achieving stable and efficient pms activation capability layered double hydroxides including cobalt and iron cofe ldhs have attracted extensive attention in the field of aops due to their convenient preparation method and excellent surface properties 11 yan et al prepared a series of cofe ldhs nanosheets and direct activated pms for antibiotics removal which exhibited efficient and stable ciprofloxacin cip degradation capability 12 to improve the stability of the catalyst cofe ldhs was enhanced by loading biochar bc and the synergistic effect between bc and cofe ldhs promoted the electron transport for pms activation 13 jiang et al designed 3d flower like magnetic cofe ldhs cofe2o4 materials to degrade aniline an and the formed larger specific surface and pore sizes could strengthen the production of ros through pms activation 14 thus employing suitable catalyst carriers to improve pms dissociation is a promising method for the promoted wastewater removal molybdenum disulfide mos2 has been widespread applied in the field of catalytic processes due to its abundant reaction sites and excellent electron transfer rate 15 meanwhile mos2 could effective promote the circulation of transition metal ions in the fenton like system 16 wang et al reported that the fe iii would be quickly reduced to fe ii with the addition of mos2 resulting in enhancing the degradation of aqueous contaminants under the fe ii pms system 17 at the same time qu et al also found that the formed mo iv sites would activate pms for pollutants degradation and the s defect sites contributed to the adsorption of pms molecules 18 to further enhance the application range of mos2 we combined the advantages of cofe ldhs and mos2 to accelerate the electron transfer process for enhanced pms activation so as to improve the removal efficiency of pollutants in the present study cofe ldhs mos2 x samples were synthesized by using a hydrothermal method tetracycline tc was used as target pollutants to explore the catalytic performance via pms activation the as synthesized catalysts were detected the physical and chemical properties through xdr ftir sem and xps to analysis in addition the quenching tests and esr detections were applied to analyze the reactive oxygen species ros the degradation pathways of tc was also deduced by using uplc qtof ms 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals nh4 6mo7o24 4h2o ch4n2s co no3 2 6h2o fe no3 3 9h2o co nh2 2 and nh4f were purchased from tianjin damao company tetracycline tc peroxymonosulfate khso5 0 5khso4 0 5k2so4 and 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo were obtained from aladdin furfuryl alcohol ffa methanol meoh chloroform cf and tert butanol tba were obtained from tianjing fuyu fine chemicals co ltd the chemicals used were all analytically grade without further purification 2 2 preparation of cofe ldhs mos2 a certain amount of nh4 6mo7o24 4h2o and ch4n2s mo s 1 2 was dispersed into 40 ml deionized water under magnetic stirring afterwards the above solution was transferred to a 100 ml telfon lined autoclave and then kept at 180 c for 12 h to obtain mos2 the cofe ldhs mos2 x were synthesized via hydrothermal method stoichiometrics of co no3 2 6h2o fe no3 3 9h2o co nh2 2 nh4f and 0 2 g mos2 were mixed in 50 ml deionized water under ultrasonic condition 20 min the obtained mixture was transferred to a 100 ml telfon lined autoclave again which was heated at 100 c for 12 h after cooling to room temperature the samples were washed by water and ethanol for several times ultimately the collected samples were dried under vacuum at 50 c overnight the samples were named as cofe ldhs mos2 x and the x represented the ratios of mo fe were 0 1 0 2 and 0 5 2 3 catalytic performance the degradation experiments were conducted into a 250 ml reactor at room temperature containing 100 ml 50 mg l tetracycline then certain quantities of catalysts and pms were introduced into the beaker to start the experiment the initial ph value was adjusted by using hcl or naoh at certain intervals 4 0 ml sample was collected and then filtered by using 0 22 μm filter membrane and detected by using ultraviolet spectrophotometer at the wavelength of 357 nm for cyclic experiment the used catalyst was separated by filtration without washing and then carried out next cycle directly 2 4 characterization x ray diffraction xrd patterns were detected by using a d8 advance x ray diffractometer emitting cu kα radiation scanning electron microscopy sem was detected by zeiss sigma 500 x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps measurement was performed by thermo scientific k alpha with an al kα x ray gun the metal ion dissolution was measured by using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes nexion 350x perkin elmer the degradation products were determined by agilent 6545 quadrupole time of flight uplc qtof ms system electron spin resonance esr technology was analyzed by using a brucker a200 s 9 5 12 spectrometer fourier transform infrared spectra ftir were detected by perkin elmer spectrum gx 3 results and discussions 3 1 characterization the xrd patterns of prepared cofe ldhs mos2 0 2 cofe ldhs and mos2 samples are illustrated in fig 1a the peaks at 2θ 11 3 22 8 34 5 60 4 and 61 7 belonged to the 003 006 009 and 110 planes of cofe ldhs 19 and the above resluts were matched with pdf no 089 3040 then the peaks at 14 46 29 12 32 96 38 15 47 90 51 85 and 58 15 corresponded to the 003 006 101 104 107 018 and 110 planes of mos2 20 however the xrd patterns showed that the cofe ldhs mos2 0 2 was not obvious mos2 phase which may caused by a small amount of mos2 load in addition the surface properties of cofe ldhs mos2 0 2 cofe ldhs and mos2 samples were further detected by the ftir analysis from fig 1b the bands situated at 3422 cm 1 were attributed to the stretching of oh groups 12 for mos2 sample the bands at 484 904 950 and 1626 cm 1 were belonged to the stretching vibration of mos ss moo and moo 21 moreover the bands at 698 825 and 1500 cm 1 were attributed to coo feo and co stretching vibration 22 moreover a new adsorption bond at 1095 cm 1 may be assigned to m mo stretching vibrations which was consistent with the previously reported 23 24 thus the above investigation results concluded the successful synthesis of cofe ldhs mos2 nanocomposites the surface morphology of cofe ldhs mos2 0 2 cofe ldhs and mos2 samples are shown in fig 2 as described in fig 2a the sem image of cofe ldhs samples showed spherical structure with the smooth surface which was mainly caused by its relatively poor crystallinity fig 2b displayed the sem image of mos2 with the nanosheet structure however it can be clearly observed that when the mos2 was introuduced into the structure of the cofe ldhs samples the cofe ldhs gradually transformed into lamellar structure this phenomenon showed that the crystallinity of cofe ldhs increased the obatined results were accorded with the xrd detection in addition the cofe ldhs samples were loaded on the mos2 surface fig 2d thus the cofe ldhs mos2 samples were successful prepared through hydrothermal synthesis the xps analysis of cofe ldhs mos2 0 2 sample was investigated in fig 3 as displayed in fig 3a the xps full spectrum analysis displayed the existence of fe co mo s and o elements on the surface of cofe ldhs mos2 0 2 sample the fe 2p spectra was showed in fig 3b the binding energy at 711 3 ev was attributed to fe ii state and then the binding energy at 713 6 ev was belonged to fe iii state which would be conducive to the oxidation and reduction of fe state 25 27 from fig 3c the binding energy at 782 2 ev was assigned to co iii state while the binding energy at 780 8 ev was assigned to co ii state 28 from fig 3d the binding energy at 226 1 228 7 232 4 and 235 7 ev was belonged to s 2s mo iv mo iv and mo vi states 21 as displayed in fig 3e the bingding energy at 161 6 ev and 162 8 ev were s2 2p2 3 and s2 2p1 2 of mos2 then the binding energy at 168 9 ev was represented so4 2 which due to the partial oxidation of mos2 23 the binding energy located at 163 7 ev was the unsaturated edge s 29 the o 1s xps spectrum also discussed in fig 3f the binding energy at 531 9 ev and 531 0 ev were belonged to the lattice oxygen and surface hydroxyl group 30 3 2 degradation performance the catalytic activities of cofe ldhs mos2 x were discussed by the degradation of tc via pms activation as shown in fig 4a different catalysts were prepared to evaluate the activation ability of pms for tc removal the addition of mos2 in the system was ineffective to degrade tc which showed low activation capacity of pms in addition the degradation efficiency of tc by adding cofe ldhs mos2 0 2 alone was also negligible when adding the cofe ldhs in the system 79 2 of tc could be removed during the 12 min subsequently the mos2 was introuduced into the cofe ldhs structure to form the cofe ldhs mos2 0 1 samples the degradation efficiency increased to 98 1 withthin 12 min suggesting that the cofe ldhs mos2 0 2 presented a remarkably catalytic activity towards pms activation for tc removal with the increase of mos2 loaded 0 1 to 0 5 the degradation efficiency of tc raised to 98 8 and then decreased to 93 8 therefore we selected 0 2 to continue the subsequent experiment as reported in fig 4b the corresponding kinetic constant indicated that the activity order was cofe ldhs mos2 0 2 cofe ldhs mos2 0 1 cofe ldhs mos2 0 5 cofe ldhs with the k value of 0 2249 0 1569 0 0925 and 0 0586 min 1 respectively the results revealed that the cofe ldhs mos2 0 2 achieved 4 4 times superior activity than bulk cofe ldhs for tc removal 3 3 the effects of reaction parameters as demonstrated in fig 5a the influence of initial ph value on the removal of tc by using cofe ldhs mos2 0 2 pms displayed that lower ph conditions were unfavourable to the removal of tc 94 9 with the ph value increased to natural conditions 5 8 and 9 0 the degradation efficiency of tc enhanced to 98 8 and 98 3 respectively when ph was in strong alkaline 11 0 the degradation rate of tc decreased to 89 1 the alkaline environment could passivate the catalysts and improved the invalid decomposition of pms to reduce the catalytic activity in the system 31 the first order dynamic results were 0 1017 0 2249 0 2588 and 0 0962 min 1 the obtained results indicated that the cofe ldhs mos2 0 2 had high catalytic performance in a broad initial ph environment 3 0 11 0 the influence of catalysts dosage on the removal of tc was investigated in fig 5b there was obvious facilitation on the degradation of tc with the catalyst dosage increased from 0 05 g l to 0 2 g l it can be explained that large amount of catalysts would provide abundant active sites for pms activation 32 the corresponding kinetic constant of k value was 0 1059 0 2249 0 2227 and 0 2819 min 1 to avoid waste caused by adding too much catalyst we selected 0 1 g l of catalyst dosage to conduct the following test from fig 5c when the pms concentration increased from 0 25 to 1 0 mm the removal efficiency of tc increased seriously k 0 0680 0 0959 and 2249 min 1 which were due to the production of more ros with a increase of pms concentration 33 however the removal efficiency had slightly decreased with the pms concentration increased to 2 mm because more pms may quench ros to affect the removal of pollutants 34 the influence of initial pollutants concentration was discussed in fig 5d the removal efficiency of tc decreased with the initial tc concentration increased to 100 mg l this is mainly because the higher content of pollutants required more free radicals for tc degradation in summary we used the conditions of ph 5 8 catalyst dose 0 1 g l pms concentration 1 mm and tc concentraion 50 mg l for subsequent analysis 3 4 determination of ros in the cofe ldhs mos2 0 2 pms system the reactive oxygen species ros quenching measurements were used to determine the catalytic mechanism of the cofe ldhs mos2 0 2 pms system methanol was used to quench hydroxyl radical oh and sulfate radical so4 35 the tert butanol tba and chloroform cf are used to mainly suppress oh and o2 36 37 moreover furfuryl alcohol ffa is selected to quenched singlet oxygen 1o2 38 as shown in fig 6a when the cf and tba were introduced in the system the degradation rate of tc had little change suggesting that the oh and o2 were not the mian ros in the cofe ldhs mos2 0 2 pms system afterwards the degradation rate of tc decreased to 79 0 and 72 2 with the addition of 150 mm and 300 mm methanol which showed the existence of so4 in the system importantly ffa was introduced to determine the 1o2 with the concentration of ffa inceased from 5 mm to 20 mm the tc degradation rate was decreased form 51 7 to 31 0 it can be found that the 1o2 play a key role on the removal of tc as shown in fig s2 the corresponding calculated contribution ratios of different ros to tc removal rate were as follows 1o2 so4 oh o2 the esr analysis was also used to verify the ros in the cofe ldhs mos2 pms system as displayed in fig 6b the dmpo x signal could be detected with the addition of cofe ldhs mos2 0 2 while the dmpo oh was found with the cofe ldhs introduced this change may be due to the oxidation of dmpo through the so4 or oh in the system 39 40 thus the signal of so4 or oh in the cofe ldhs mos2 0 2 pms system was not obvious from fig 6c the cofe ldhs mos2 0 2 revealed the strongest signal of 1o2 which showed that the mos2 loading could enhance the reaction of non free radical this phenomenon can be explained that the mo vi could react with o2 to produce 1o2 29 in addition the o2 radicals capture experiments were carried out in fig 6d a o2 signal was discovered but the o2 was not the mian ros in the cofe ldhs mos2 0 2 system 3 5 degradation mechanism the spent cofe ldhs mos2 0 2 catalysts combination and valence change were detected by xps analysis to deduce the catalytic mechanism as shown in fig 7a the element composition still contains co fe s mo and o after catalytic reaction however the fe 2p xps results showed the relative proportion of fe ii increased to 58 5 as compared with the fresh cofe ldhs mos2 0 2 56 5 fig 7b the cocatalytic effect of mos2 realized iron ion conversion in the cofe ldh mos2 0 2 system eq 1 similar to the fe 2p the proportion of co ii increased to 60 9 fresh 47 9 and the co iii decreased to 39 1 fig 7c this could be explained that the cyclic reaction of co iii co ii and fe iii fe ii enhanced the proportion of co ii eq 2 1 mo4 fe3 mo6 fe2 2 co3 fe2 co2 fe3 as displayed in fig 7d there was no obvious change in the valence state of mo in the mo 3d xps spectrum which indicated that mo remained stable after catalytic reaction the phenomenon was mainly due to the redox of mo iv and mo vi during the process of pms activation 41 from fig 7e the valence state of the unsaturated edge s 163 7 ev did not change evidently suggesting that the s sites could be exposed in the system 42 the o 1s xps spectrum showed that the proportion of lattice oxygen enhanced after reaction suggesting that the lattice oxygen may be participated in the activation of pms to produce ros 43 44 based on the above discussion and analysis the possible ros generation mechanisms in the cofe ldhs mos2 pms system were shown in fig 8 3 6 degradation pathways of tc by cofe ldhs mos2 pms system the uplc qtof ms was used to deduce the possible degradation pathways of tc during the cofe ldhs mos2 0 2 pms process and the analysis results were showed in fig 9 then the main degradation intermediate were displayed in table s1 after oxidation process the m z 445 tc could be oxidized to the intermediate products of m z 417 and m z 474 via demethylation and carbonylation reaction 45 subsequently the intermediate product of m z 362 was formed by the attack of hydroxyl and cc bond 46 during the further oxidation and ring opening processes the intermediates of m z 149 and m z 122 were formed in addition the ros might attack the intermediates of m z 474 which would be produced the m z 274 and m z 279 the dehydroxylation demethylation and ring opening intermediate products of m z 220 and m z 156 were formed through oxidation reaction 47 ultimately all the intermediates m z 122 m z 146 and m z 90 were transformed to produce co2 and h2o 3 7 stability evaluation the regeneration and stability of heterogeneous catalyst are key factors herein the reusability of the cofe ldhs mos2 0 2 samples were discussed through cycle experiments in fig s1 during the four cycles of experiments the degradation efficiencies of tc presented a downward trend 95 2 70 8 54 4 and 45 4 respectively the catalyst exhibited showed certain catalytic stability and application potential and its degradation efficiency could still be remained above 50 after third cycle moreover the dissolving results of fe co and mo ions were also identified to estimate the catalysts stability from fig s1b the dissolved fe ion was 1 66 0 45 0 31 and 0 12 mg l then the dissolved co ion was 11 92 3 76 2 15 and 0 87 mg l finally the dissolved mo ion was 1 38 0 37 0 24 and 0 16 mg l in the final analysis we should further strengthen the catalysts stability and decrease the metal ions dissolution 4 conclusion in this work the cofe ldhs mos2 x samples were successfully synthesized by hydrothermal method the xrd ftir and sem results showed that cofe ldhs were loaded on the surface of mos2 nanosheets the removal rate of tc achieved at 98 8 within 12 min in the cofe ldhs mos2 0 2 pms process and the reaction kinetic constant was 4 4 times higher than those
