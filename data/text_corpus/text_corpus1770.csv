8850,crop modeling is an effective tool for simulating crop growth under various agricultural water and salinity management practices however most crop models fail to describe the root dynamics in response to soil stresses adequately to address this issue field experiments were conducted by planting sunflowers in saline soils three machine learning ml models of random forest rf gaussian process regression gpr and extreme gradient boosting xgboost were initially introduced for predicting root length density rld then by coupling with a crop model swap the soil salt content ssc soil water content swc and crop growth indicators of leaf area index lai and dry matter dm were simulated results show that rf and xgboost models could predict rld more accurately than the gpr model with root mean square error rmse lower than 0 473 cm cm 3 compared to using a typical cubic polynomial function cpf of rld in the swap model similar swc and ssc simulation results were obtained based on the ml models however for the crop growth simulation the performances of ml models were significantly better than the cpf especially for lai simulation in the high salinity fields the relative root mean square error rrmse in the rf model was 0 222 0 282 lower than in the cpf moreover compared to the xgboost model of rld more accurate and stable simulation results of swc ssc and lai were obtained based on the rf model these results illustrate that ml models especially the rf model can be used to quantify rld dynamics and improve crop modeling performances abbreviation rld root length density

learning swap soil water and salt modeling crop growth modeling data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction soil salinization is one of the dominant factors accelerating soil degradation and restricting agricultural productivity kopittke et al 2019 over 100 countries and over 1 billion hectares of land suffer from soil salinization ivushkin et al 2019 natural events and anthropogenic activities including flash floods long term drought climate change irrigation and fertilizer affect soil salt status cuevas et al 2019 hassani et al 2020 with the combined effects of these factors soil salinity is dynamically varied at spatial and temporal scales which leads to greater challenges in agricultural water management and crop productivity evaluation in the saline area hassani et al 2021 crop modeling is an effective tool for simulating crop growth in various environmental conditions and agricultural management practices yu et al 2021 a variety of crop models have been used to simulate crop growth under salinity stress carcedo et al 2022 sarkar et al 2022 but their quantification methods differ in diverse focus and applications hammami et al 2020 karlberg et al 2006 one method is based on the empirical functions between soil salt content ssc and crop indicators e g biomass and yield qiu et al 2017 zhang et al 2022 owing to its simple structure and few parameter demands this method is widely applied in aquacrop vanuytrecht et al 2014 apsim zeng et al 2016 and cropsyst stockle et al 2003 models however these models are usually difficult to describe the dynamic influences of soil salinity because they do not precisely quantify the soil water and salt movements in the root zone another method is based on a detailed description of soil root dynamic interactions on crop water use such as in the swap verma et al 2012 and hydus epic feng et al 2019 models in these models the soil water and salt dynamics are quantified by the physical based equations i e richards equation and convective dispersion equation the soil abiotic stresses on soil root water transports are described by a root water uptake rwu model such as the feddes model in swap feddes et al 1978 jarvis 1989 kroes et al 2017 maas and hoffman 1977 the piecewise linear functions of soil water and salt content or its equivalent variable are used to quantify the soil water and salinity stresses respectively the physiological responses of crops related to daily assimilation capacity and leaf death rate are quantified based on the stress factor of the rwu model as one of the essential variables in the rwu model wu et al 1999 root length density rld the root length in a unit volume of soil or its vertical relative distribution is an indispensable input however rld measurement is time consuming and laborious work ning et al 2015 zuo et al 2013 numerous studies have attempted to quantify the spatiotemporal characteristics of rld ning et al 2019 pages et al 2012 yang et al 2009 wu et al 1999 proposed a concept of the normalized rld nrld by assuming crops have a similar distribution of rld at different growth stages they suggested a third order polynomial function to quantify the nrld distribution of wheat maize cotton and beans ning et al 2019 assessed the polynomial exponential and power functions of nrld and recommended an improved polynomial function for estimating the nrld distribution of four crops their simple structure makes nrld functions convenient to use and achieve resounding success however almost all nrld models fail to consider the root plasticity to soil stresses gao et al 2014 ning et al 2015 except for a few studies like ma et al 2021 as a critical component of the plant connected with soil roots can adjust morphological structure in response to soil drought and salinity stresses with hydrotropism and halotropism gao and lynch 2016 and sebastian et al 2016 found maize zea mays l ceased the growth of crown roots and reduced their number in surface soil while accelerating the lateral root growth in deep soil under drought stress ma et al 2017 found that the root of sunflower helianthus annuus l was more sparse in the surface soil of high salinity fields but in deep soil the rld was more than twice as high as that in low salinity fields moreover besides being affected by soil root growth also interacts with the crop s aboveground contador et al 2015 o grady et al 2006 allard et al 2013 found that the root biomass and allocation of wheat are affected by the shoot growth including tiller formation and leaf production ma et al 2021 illustrated that the dynamic root growth of the sunflower was closely related to its canopy development therefore an issue could be proposed that the nrld functions in existing crop models may not be appropriate for crop modeling under water and salinity stresses how to quantify the influence of soil moisture salinity and aboveground growth on the rld dynamics in crop modeling remains an open question in recent years with the superiority of unraveling non linear relationships machine learning ml models including random forest rf gaussian process regression gpr multivariate adaptive regression splines mars and extreme gradient boosting xgboost have been broadly employed in predicting transpiration pan evaporation plant biomass soil moisture etc dubois et al 2021 han et al 2019 as a data driven approach ml models were also successfully applied to crop growth simulations zhang et al 2019 assimilated the aquacrop model by canopy cover value which was extracted from aerial images based on ml based classification paudel et al 2022 found the mcyfs model based on ml performed better than a linear trend model at the regional level in nine countries and six crops shahhosseini et al 2019 compared four ml algorithms as meta models in apsim to predict maize yield and n loss and concluded that rf was the optimum technique for its higher accuracy and lower data requirements recently wu et al 2022 implemented ml algorithms to predict rld using other easily observable information including soil water content swc ssc leaf area index lai dry matter dm and root depth rd however although the potential of ml for rld prediction has been illustrated few studies have discussed the feasibility of coupling ml models of rld ml rld into crop models the preferred ml models for simulating rld combined with crop models are yet unknown moreover further investigation is required to evaluate the simulation performance of ml rld in terms of swc ssc and crop growth compared to the nrld method employed in the crop model to address these issues taking two years of field experiments with sunflower as the background three ml models of rf gpr and xgboost were developed to predict the rld then by coupling with a crop model swap the swc ssc and crop growth indicators of lai and dm were simulated respectively the study aimed to achieve two objectives 1 assess the applicability of the ml rld for coupling with the swap model 2 identify the suitable ml rld for simulating swc ssc and crop growth indicators 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental background the field experiments were conducted in three natural saline fields s1 s2 and s3 in 2016 and 2017 at the yichang experimental station 41 04 15 n 108 00 29 e located in the hetao irrigation district of inner mongolia china the data were collected from 2016 noted as 2016s1 2016s2 2016s3 and from 2017 as 2017s1 2017s2 and 2017s3 the volumetric swc and ssc in each field were measured at a depth of 0 100 cm the soil sampling depth intervals were 10 cm from the top 0 40 cm and 20 cm from 40 to 100 cm the soil samples were collected 30 51 65 and 106 days after sowing das in 2016 and at 28 58 68 78 and 110 das in 2017 respectively swc was measured by oven drying at 105 for 8 h ssc was indicated by the electrical conductivity of the saturated paste extracts of soil ece which was converted by ec1 5 the ec1 5 was measured as the electrical conductivity of soil solution with dry soil and deionized water and the mixed volume ratio of both was 1 5 in 2016 before sowing the average ece values at a depth of 0 100 cm in three fields s1 s2 and s3 were 1 72 2 71 ds m 1 3 51 5 90 ds m 1 and 7 54 10 32 ds m 1 respectively in 2017 the average ece values in the same three fields were relatively lower ranging from 1 07 to 2 84 1 30 3 28 and 1 05 5 95 ds m 1 respectively these lower values were primarily due to the short interval between irrigation and soil sampling in 2017 while the ece value in s2 and s3 fields increased during the crop growth period the particle size distribution 0 100 cm in three fields was also measured by a laser particle size analyzer before the experiments table 1 moreover the meteorological data including temperature relative humidity solar radiation and precipitation were measured by an automatic meteorological station located about 20 m beside the study fields detailed meteorological information can be found in lei et al 2023 the sunflower helianthus annuus l was sowed on june 5 2016 and may 27 2017 and harvested on sep 19 2016 and sep 15 2017 respectively the crop growth indicators including lai dm rld and rd were measured during the whole crop growth period the maximum length l and width w of each leaf was measured at an interval of 7 days the leaf area la was calculated based on the empirical equation la 0 6564 l w proposed by chen 1984 lai was calculated according to the green leaf area per unit of ground area the dm of plants was measured at each growth stage with the fresh plant after oven dried to constant weight at 80 c the rld and rd were monitored from four parallel transparent rhizotubes which were diagonally inserted 45 to the horizontal into the soil in the middle of the two sowing rows with a horizontal interval of 1 m and the vertical depth of insertion was about 1 0 m the roots surrounding the rhizotubes were scanned at the interval of 7 10 days with a root 700 digital camera ecomatik munich germany layer by layer the vertical height of each scan layer was controlled to 15 cm the crop root length in each scanned image was distinguished with winrhizotron software regent instruments inc quebec canada the rld was converted by assuming that the equivalent soil thickness surrounding the rhizotubes was equal to 2 5 mm the rld and rd of the field were calculated by their average statuses in four parallel rhizotube images 2 2 swap model 2 2 1 model theory swap model is a physically

experimental fitting in this study in eq 1 the sink term of s is quantified by the feddes model 1978 the piecewise linear functions related to soil matric potential and solute concentration are used to describe the heterogeneous soil water and salinity stresses according to jarvis 1989 and maas and hoffman 1977 s at a depth of z can be calculated as follow 6 s z min 1 ω ω c α f h c β z t pot

and h3 are the pressure heads between which rwu keeps the maximum rate moreover αf h also correlates with tpot because the critical point h3 is a piecewise linear function of tpot brandyk and wesseling 1985 considering the compensation effects of rwu a stress index ω was introduced to integrate the stress function αf h c weighting by the β z 10 ω l z α f h c β z d z where lz is the rooting

swap model version 4 the detailed crop growth process is described as analogous to the wofost model boogaard et al 1998 here we briefly introduce the simulations of lai and dm dm is the result of the daily accumulation of net crop assimilation anet kg ha 1 d 1 which is calculated as the difference between the daily assimilation amount agross kg ha 1 d 1 and maintenance respiratory consumption rm

plants tact tpot the values of rm kg ha 1 d 1 are related to many factors such as the maintenance respiration coefficient the senescence reduction coefficient and the daily average temperature lai simulation is mainly controlled by leaf growth rate and aging rate their quantitative methods are related to the ratio of actual and potential crop transpiration 13 w g r o s s s h o o t ξ s h o o t c

in the swap model the upper and bottom boundaries of the soil profile were controlled by atmospheric conditions and groundwater tables respectively the simulation starts on the sowing day and ends on the harvest day the initial conditions of the soil water and salt status were determined by experimental observations then taking the measured rld as inputs the parameters of the swap model related to crop growth soil water movement solute transport and rwu were selected for calibration using a parameter optimization software pest white et al 2020 exactly as the following steps first adjusted the phenological parameters to make the simulated phenological period of the crop consistent with the actual situation second calibrated the crop parameters based on the potential status of lai and dm which was assumed by 1 1 times crop growth status in a low salinity field third calibrated the soil water and solute transport parameters based on the measurements of swc and ssc to avoid the influence of simulation uncertainty in crop growth we modified the original swap model by selecting the daily linear interpolation of measured lai and rld as input the initial value of soil hydraulic parameters is predicted by the rosetta model with soil texture leaver fay et al 2011 fourth calibrated the drought and salinity stress parameters based on the measurements of lai and dm in each field the calibrated swap model parameters are listed in tables 2 3 2 3 ml rld models three ml models including rf xgboost and gpr were employed to predict rld these models utilized the input variables of swc ssc rd lai and das the hyperparameters of ml models were tuned based on the training dataset based on 2000 times random five fold cross validation the datasets of four fields 2016s1 2016s2 2016s3 and 2017s1 were selected to train the models while the remaining two fields 2017s2 2017s3 were used for testing the models specifically to assess the applicability of the ml models under different levels of soil salinity 2017s2 and 2017s3 are selected as the two testing fields 2 3 1 rf model random forest an ensemble tree learning model was widely applied in classiﬁcation and regression problems by its excellent compatibility and powerful ability to handle high dimensional data breiman 2001 timsina et al 2021 yang et al 2021 the rf model combines a multitude of decision trees where each tree is randomly sampled from the original dataset by a bootstrap method in addition at each node of the tree the best predictor was chosen from the candidate set rather than the whole dataset against overfitting dong et al 2021 for regression problems the ultimate result is calculated as the mean prediction of the individual integrated trees in the forest moreover to assess the variable influences on rld prediction the variable importance of rf was evaluated with indexes of incmse and incnodepurity incmse refers to the impacts when the variable changes its value showing the importance of the variable a higher value means more important dewi and chen 2019 incnodepurity represents the influence of each variable on the heterogeneity of observed values at each node of the classification trees furthermore the hyperparameters of rf were ntree and minleafsize the ntree represents the number of decision trees minleafsize refers to the minimum number of samples allowed in a leaf node of a decision tree the ntree and minleafsize were tuned as 275 and 1 in this study respectively 2 3 2 xgboost model xgboost is a computationally improved algorithm of gradient boosting tree based model developed by chen et al 2016 unlike the rf model training each tree independently xgboost grows trees on the residuals of the previous tree and builds new weak tree models concerning the negative gradient of the loss function which means it can learn from the previous errors natekin and knoll 2013 furthermore xgboost offers the possibility of penalizing the complexity of the trees to avoid overfitting and accelerate modeling speed an arduous problem for xgboost is the optimal selection of the complicated hyperparameters that are sensitive and significant against overfitting and low efficiency iatrou et al 2021 the variable importance indicators are three items gain cover and frequency the gain implies the relative contribution for the predictions like the incmse in rf the cover is the relative number of observations related to the variable nearly like the incnodepurity the frequency is the percentage representing the relative number of times a particular feature occurs in the trees of the model which will not be analyzed in our study for its mathematical intricacy the hyperparameters of xgboost were nrounds eta min child weight and max depth the nrounds specifies the number of boosting rounds or iterations to perform like the ntree of rf model the eta controls the step size at each boosting round to prevent overfitting the min child weight helps control overfitting by adding regularization to the model the max depth sets the maximum depth of each decision tree which allows the model to capture more complex relationships in the data in this study the nrounds eta min child weight and max depth were tuned as 500 0 1 4 and 6 respectively fig 1 2 3 3 gpr model gpr is a non parametric ml algorithm according to a probabilistic bayesian regression method williams and rasmussen 2006 in the gpr model the joint distribution of training and testing is a multidimensional gaussian process and the predicted distribution is obtained by conditioning on the training data camps valls et al 2016 obtained by the maximum log likelihood estimation the flexible kernel function covariance function automatically optimizes the hyperparameters in a nutshell gpr is characterized by remarkable performance on small sample size non parametric inference ﬂexibility and provide probabilistic signiﬁcance based on the automatic optimization algorithm of gpr no hyperparameters of gpr were tuned in this study 2 4 coupling of ml rld models and swap model the dynamic interactions of rld with lai swc and ssc were described by coupling ml rld models and the swap model fig 2 the coupling steps are as follows step 1 prepare the initial and boundary conditions of the simulated soil profile and calibrates soil water and solute transport parameters and crop parameters in the swap model described as section 2 2 2 step 2 run the swap model to simulate crop growth and soil water and salt movements step 3 select the outputs of the swap model including lai swc ssc and corresponding das as inputs to run the ml rld model for obtaining the predicted rld at that condition step 4 take the simulated rld in the ml rld model as inputs to run the swap model step 5 repeat steps 2 4 at each time step until the end of the simulation 2 5 evaluating the ml rld and swap coupling model taking a scenario simulated with the measured rld mr as a benchmark the simulation results of swc ssc lai and dm were compared in the different swap and ml rld coupling models in the mr scenario the daily rld distribution linearly interpolated with the measured rld distribution was selected as an input to run the swap model generally a better ml rld model means it has similar simulation results to the mr scenario moreover to demonstrate the superiority or limitation of the coupling model of ml rld and swap the original swap model was simulated based on the fitting results of a typical cubic polynomial function cpf of nrld the cpf was fitted with the data in the fields of 2016s1 2016s2 2016s3 and 2017s1 while data from 2017s2 and 2017s3 were used to test their feasibility fig 3 2 6 statistic indicators four statistic indicators were applied in

the average of measured and predicted values respectively and m is the number of measurements 3 results 3 1 rld simulation based on three ml models the simulation results of rld in the testing fields are shown in fig 4 the simulation accuracies of rld based on rf and xgboost models were better than the gpr model such as the rmse of rf and xgboost were 0 304 0 473 cm cm 3 which were lower than the gpr 0 364 0 663 cm cm 3 especially in the 2017s3 field gpr overestimated rld on 58 and 68 das while rf and xgboost predicted it in an acceptable range therefore the rf and xgboost models were selected to be coupled with the swap model in this study the variable importance of rf and xgboost models is shown in fig 5 for the xgboost model the apparent differences among different input variables were presented such as the gain values of lai and ssc approach 0 48 and 0 26 respectively which were obviously greater than the other input variables however for the rf model although the incmse of lai 0 22 was also greater than other variables the differences in incmse between these variables were smaller such as the incmse of swc ssc and rd were all around 0 14 0 16 the top three variables of the incnodepurity in rf were lai 37 0 ssc 26 4 and swc 14 6 in xgboost the top three variables of the cover were lai 0 29 swc 0 25 and ssc 0 24 3 2 soil water and salt content simulation as shown in fig 6 the swc generally decreased with some fluctuations and the variations of swc at the topsoils 0 40 cm were more obvious than in the deeper soil layers 40 100 cm such as in the 2016s2 field the swc at the topsoils gradually reduced from 0 3 to 0 37 cm3 cm 3 to 0 2 0 25 cm3 cm 3 during the crop growth period while an increasing fluctuation occurred nearly 80 das in the deeper soil layers the swc gradually decreased from 0 4 to 0 42 cm3 cm 3 to 0 2 0 25 cm3 cm 3 compared with the deeper soil layers the simulation differences of swc in the topsoils based on different rld models were more significant such as in the 2017s1 field the differences in swc between the mr and cpf scenarios were about 0 10 0 15 cm3 cm 3 in the topsoils while the deeper soil layers were less than 0 05 cm3 cm 3 moreover the averaged differences of simulated swc among the rld models ranged from 0 05 to 0 10 cm3 cm 3 mainly occurring in the late growth period of the crop as shown in table 4 the training accuracy of swc by three models cpf rf and xgboost was similar to the mr scenario with the difference among models in rmse and rrmse lower than 0 003 cm3 cm 3 and 0 008 respectively in two testing fields 2017s2 and 2017s3 all three models performed excellently with differences in rmse and rrmse under 0 007 cm3 cm 3 and 0 017 table 4 as shown in fig 7 the simulated ssc generally increased during the crop growth period but the increasing trend varied among different fields in 2016s1 and 2017s1 the ssc ranged between 3 and 12 mg cm 3 while for 2016s2 and 2017s2 the ssc increased from 8 to 20 mg cm 3 moreover the increases in topsoils were more significant than those in deeper soil layers for example in the 2016s3 field the ssc in the mr scenario and three different ml models increased from 6 to 30 mg cm 3 in topsoils and from 6 to 18 mg cm 3 in deeper soil layers besides the simulation accuracies of ssc with two ml models are slightly better than the cpf model and close to the mr scenario table 5 in most training fields 2016 s1 2016 s2 and 2016s3 rf and xgboost performed slightly better than the cpf model on rmse and rrmse the advantage lower than 0 1 mg cm 3 and 0 01 respectively but not on r2 the difference lower than 0 04 however in the training field 2017s1 the simulation accuracies of rf and xgboost models nse reached 0 567 and 0 580 respectively were comparable to the mr scenario nse reached 0 608 and obviously better than the cpf model nse reached 0 015 in the testing field of 2017s2 the rf and xgboost models performed better than the cpf model in all statistic indicators 3 3 crop growth simulation as shown in fig 8 the simulated lai showed distinct variances based on different rld models especially in the fields with high salinity the rf model exhibited high accuracy and excellent stability across all fields for example the rmse in the training fields were 0 89 0 44 0 82 and 1 22 respectively which were close to the mr scenario in contrast the cpf model performed worse than the rf model in most fields table 6 and showed instability and poor precision when simulating the fields with high salinity such as in the 2016s2 and 2017s3 fields the rrmse of the cpf model was higher by 0 222 0 282 than the rf model compared with the xgboost model the rf model got relatively higher accuracy in training fields such as in the 2016s2 2016s3 and 2017s1 fields with rrmse lower by 0 085 0 122 in the test fields the predicting capacity of the rf model was also excellent with rrmse within 0 201 0 399 the simulation performance of dm fig 9 with the ml rld models was better than with the cpf model table 7 especially in fields with high salinity 2016s3 and 2017s3 the rrmse of dm simulation with the ml models were 0 235 and 0 210 respectively which were obviously lower than those of the cpf model 0 469 and 0 599 moreover in testing fields 2017s2 and 2017s3 the nse of the dm simulations by rf 0 940 and 0 910 are obviously higher than that by the cpf model 0 584 and 0 074 although the accuracy difference between the rf and xgboost models in the testing fields was slight the performance of the rf model in the training fields was significantly better than that of the xgboost model for instance compared with the xgboost model the rrmse of the rf model in the 2016s1 and 2016s3 fields was lower by 0 039 and 0 147 4 discussion 4 1 performances of ml and cpf models of rld two kinds of models of ml and cpf were employed to predict the rld dynamics and coupling with the swap model in this study the difference between the two models is that the ml model could describe dynamic interactions between the rld and relevant factors while the cpf model could not previous studies have shown that the nrld distribution of some crops such as cotton wheat maize and rice could be well quantified by the polynomial functions under different soil water situations ning et al 2019 however in this study poor fitting performances of nrld were obtained especially in the high salinity fields fig 3 r2 0 03 in 2017s3 unlike the cpf model the swc ssc and lai were selected as inputs to predict the rld in the ml models owing to the tremendous high dimensional non linear fitting ability ji et al 2021 wang and li 2019 satisfying simulated results of rld were obtained in ml models fig 4 r2 0 59 rmse 0 43 cm cm 3 in the rf and xgboost models in two test fields the rld is one of the essential variables for calculating the rwu which is a sink term in the richards equation to quantify the dynamics of swc however the differences in simulated swc based on different rld models were slight this could be attributed to the limited influences of rwu on soil water status and other environmental factors such as soil physical properties groundwater table and meteorological conditions could play a dominant role in soil water movement kargas et al 2016 konapala et al 2020 lei et al 2019 moreover the simulated rwu in the feddes model could be insensitive to the variations of rld distribution especially in high salt and dry situations the soil water salt status could primarily affect rwu patterns but the differences in simulated swc in the topsoils 0 40 cm were slightly greater than that in the deeper layers 40 100 cm fig 6 it was because of the relatively high rld in the topsoils which leads to a high rwu and has a greater impact on the swc the dynamic of ssc is related to the dynamics of soil water and salt transport parameters similar to the simulated swc with the different rld models the simulated ssc did not present an apparent difference except in the topsoils nonetheless the ml models performed outstandingly in both training and testing fields during swc and ssc simulations while the cpf model had weaker predictions in the 2017s1 and 2017s2 fields compared with simulated swc and ssc the simulated lai and dm presented greater divergence based on different rld models these results should be attributed to the crop modeling theory in the swap model kroes et al 2017 the differences in the simulated rld affect the potential rwu pattern and change the soil water salt stress factor thereby restricting the crop s actual transpiration then the ratio of actual transpiration to potential transpiration determines crops daily biomass assimilation rate and leaf aging death rate in the swap model van dam et al 2008 therefore the different rld models led to a disparate and noticeable impact on the crop growth simulation our study showed slight differences between the cpf and ml models in low salinity fields such as 2016s1 and 2017s1 nevertheless in high salinity fields such as 2016s3 and 2017s3 a significant deviation in lai and dm simulations was presented between cpf and ml models this is due to the cpf model s assumption of a constant nrld throughout the entire growing season which could not describe the dynamic changes of the rld under varying soil water and salinity stresses ma et al 2021 wu et al 2022 thereby restricting the simulation accuracy of crop growth 4 2 ml model selection although numerous ml models and their hybrid approaches have been proposed the suitability of each model for different applications remains unclear xu et al 2021 many studies obtained inconsistent results in ml models due to variations in datasets and objectives loggenberg et al 2018 watson hernandez et al 2022 for example liu et al 2021 found that xgboost obtained higher accuracy than rf in the lai simulation from multispectral images however aasim et al 2022 concluded that rf exhibited better predictions than xgboost for optimizing in vitro germination and growth indices of industrial hemp in this study the accuracy of the gpr model was lower than the other two models in the testing fields it should be attributed to the overfitting of the gpr model similar results were reported by cosenza et al 2022 especially when fitting small and insufficient datasets with some outliers mao et al 2019 regarding the two tree based ensemble ml models the rf and xgboost models demonstrated comparable accuracy across the six fields however the rf model showed superior precision and stability in all fields this was because the rf and xgboost models captured different information from input variables although both models considered lai as the most important input variable the essential differences between lai and other variables were distinct in these two models the xgboost model assessed higher importance to lai with a gain value of up to 0 474 thereby reducing the reliance on other variables such as ssc and swc this limited the potential influence of soil environments on rld simulation meanwhile the lai simulation error might significantly affect the simulation accuracy of rld in the xgboost model especially in the high salinity field such as 2016s3 on the contrary the rf model considered the importance of various input variables more equally taking into account the comprehensive effects of lai swc and ssc this enhanced the stability and robustness of the simulations moreover the variable importance analysis gave us more perspectives to understand the intricate relationships between targets and labels in this study when the rf and the xgboost models invested identical resources to simulate ssc and swc the reward of the ssc was approximately twice as much as that of the swc in two ml models fig 5 the phenomena revealed that the ssc was more heterogeneous and unequable than the swc which is also a clue that the ssc has a significant impact on the rld in the soil environment in our study 4 3 limitations and outlooks for the swap and ml rld coupling model this study found an efficient ml model rf of rld that is appropriate for coupling with the swap model which could be a potential strategy to improve crop modeling under various environmental influences with the appropriate coupling of swap and ml rld data we effectively simulated the water and salt dynamics and crop growth indicators in different saline fields which indicates parameter calibration is reliable in this study however there remain some uncertainties in the parameter calibration due to limited observations for instance in the crop parameters calibration we amplified the crop growth indicators in a low salinity field to represent the potential growth state of the crop while the amplification factor may affect the calibration results of water and salinity stress parameters and subsequently alter the crop growth simulation additionally to pre calibrate the swap model parameters we use linear daily interpolation of measured rld as input although the fact that we observe roots quite frequently our observations still cannot fully represent the actual growth conditions of the roots moreover soil physical properties exhibit strong spatial variability at the field scale while we did not directly measure soil hydraulic parameters and solute transport parameters which may affect the simulation results of soil water and salt movements therefore we encourage optimizing the physical model parameters based on more comprehensive and detailed experimental observations in further study as well as testing the coupling performances of different ml models of rld and crop models in more scenarios such as for different crop varieties grown in different soil types and weather conditions 5 conclusions and outlooks root dynamics quantification is a challenging issue that directly impacts crop growth simulation results in this study three ml models including rf gpr and xgboost were developed to predict the rld of sunflowers in different salinity fields the rld simulations showed the rf and xgboost rmse within 0 304 0 473 cm cm 3 model performed more steadily and accurately than gpr rmse within 0 364 0 663 cm cm 3 in the test fields to quantify the dynamic interactions between rld and related variables we innovatively coupled them with a typical physical based crop model swap in crop growth simulations the ml models demonstrated obvious advantages over the traditional cpf model the poor fitting performances of the cpf model in several high salinity fields limited its accuracy in lai simulation the rrmse in the rf model was 0 222 0 282 lower than in the cpf the results illustrate ml models have great potential to quantify rld dynamics and improve crop modeling performances furthermore compared with the xgboost model the rf model generally exhibited superior precision and stability for simulating swc ssc and crop growth due to fairly capturing information from input variables for the lai and dm simulations in several training fields the rrmse in the rf model was lower than in the xgboost model by 0 085 0 122 and 0 038 0 147 these results are beneficial for exploring an appropriate ml model for rld simulation in the coupling model and understanding the factors influencing their performances further studies are encouraged to expand the coupling models with different ml and physical based crop models and explore the application in more scenarios such as different crop varieties and environmental conditions

8850,crop modeling is an effective tool for simulating crop growth under various agricultural water and salinity management practices however most crop models fail to describe the root dynamics in response to soil stresses adequately to address this issue field experiments were conducted by planting sunflowers in saline soils three machine learning ml models of random forest rf gaussian process regression gpr and extreme gradient boosting xgboost were initially introduced for predicting root length density rld then by coupling with a crop model swap the soil salt content ssc soil water content swc and crop growth indicators of leaf area index lai and dry matter dm were simulated results show that rf and xgboost models could predict rld more accurately than the gpr model with root mean square error rmse lower than 0 473 cm cm 3 compared to using a typical cubic polynomial function cpf of rld in the swap model similar swc and ssc simulation results were obtained based on the ml models however for the crop growth simulation the performances of ml models were significantly better than the cpf especially for lai simulation in the high salinity fields the relative root mean square error rrmse in the rf model was 0 222 0 282 lower than in the cpf moreover compared to the xgboost model of rld more accurate and stable simulation results of swc ssc and lai were obtained based on the rf model these results illustrate that ml models especially the rf model can be used to quantify rld dynamics and improve crop modeling performances abbreviation rld root length density

soil degradation and restricting agricultural productivity kopittke et al 2019 over 100 countries and over 1 billion hectares of land suffer from soil salinization ivushkin et al 2019 natural events and anthropogenic activities including flash floods long term drought climate change irrigation and fertilizer affect soil salt status cuevas et al 2019 hassani et al 2020 with the combined effects of these factors soil salinity is dynamically varied at spatial and temporal scales which leads to greater challenges in agricultural water management and crop productivity evaluation in the saline area hassani et al 2021 crop modeling is an effective tool for simulating crop growth in various environmental conditions and agricultural management practices yu et al 2021 a variety of crop models have been used to simulate crop growth under salinity stress carcedo et al 2022 sarkar et al 2022 but their quantification methods differ in diverse focus and applications hammami et al 2020 karlberg et al 2006 one method is based on the empirical functions between soil salt content ssc and crop indicators e g biomass and yield qiu et al 2017 zhang et al 2022 owing to its simple structure and few parameter demands this method is widely applied in aquacrop vanuytrecht et al 2014 apsim zeng et al 2016 and cropsyst stockle et al 2003 models however these models are usually difficult to describe the dynamic influences of soil salinity because they do not precisely quantify the soil water and salt movements in the root zone another method is based on a detailed description of soil root dynamic interactions on crop water use such as in the swap verma et al 2012 and hydus epic feng et al 2019 models in these models the soil water and salt dynamics are quantified by the physical based equations i e richards equation and convective dispersion equation the soil abiotic stresses on soil root water transports are described by a root water uptake rwu model such as the feddes model in swap feddes et al 1978 jarvis 1989 kroes et al 2017 maas and hoffman 1977 the piecewise linear functions of soil water and salt content or its equivalent variable are used to quantify the soil water and salinity stresses respectively the physiological responses of crops related to daily assimilation capacity and leaf death rate are quantified based on the stress factor of the rwu model as one of the essential variables in the rwu model wu et al 1999 root length density rld the root length in a unit volume of soil or its vertical relative distribution is an indispensable input however rld measurement is time consuming and laborious work ning et al 2015 zuo et al 2013 numerous studies have attempted to quantify the spatiotemporal characteristics of rld ning et al 2019 pages et al 2012 yang et al 2009 wu et al 1999 proposed a concept of the normalized rld nrld by assuming crops have a similar distribution of rld at different growth stages they suggested a third order polynomial function to quantify the nrld distribution of wheat maize cotton and beans ning et al 2019 assessed the polynomial exponential and power functions of nrld and recommended an improved polynomial function for estimating the nrld distribution of four crops their simple structure makes nrld functions convenient to use and achieve resounding success however almost all nrld models fail to consider the root plasticity to soil stresses gao et al 2014 ning et al 2015 except for a few studies like ma et al 2021 as a critical component of the plant connected with soil roots can adjust morphological structure in response to soil drought and salinity stresses with hydrotropism and halotropism gao and lynch 2016 and sebastian et al 2016 found maize zea mays l ceased the growth of crown roots and reduced their number in surface soil while accelerating the lateral root growth in deep soil under drought stress ma et al 2017 found that the root of sunflower helianthus annuus l was more sparse in the surface soil of high salinity fields but in deep soil the rld was more than twice as high as that in low salinity fields moreover besides being affected by soil root growth also interacts with the crop s aboveground contador et al 2015 o grady et al 2006 allard et al 2013 found that the root biomass and allocation of wheat are affected by the shoot growth including tiller formation and leaf production ma et al 2021 illustrated that the dynamic root growth of the sunflower was closely related to its canopy development therefore an issue could be proposed that the nrld functions in existing crop models may not be appropriate for crop modeling under water and salinity stresses how to quantify the influence of soil moisture salinity and aboveground growth on the rld dynamics in crop modeling remains an open question in recent years with the superiority of unraveling non linear relationships machine learning ml models including random forest rf gaussian process regression gpr multivariate adaptive regression splines mars and extreme gradient boosting xgboost have been broadly employed in predicting transpiration pan evaporation plant biomass soil moisture etc dubois et al 2021 han et al 2019 as a data driven approach ml models were also successfully applied to crop growth simulations zhang et al 2019 assimilated the aquacrop model by canopy cover value which was extracted from aerial images based on ml based classification paudel et al 2022 found the mcyfs model based on ml performed better than a linear trend model at the regional level in nine countries and six crops shahhosseini et al 2019 compared four ml algorithms as meta models in apsim to predict maize yield and n loss and concluded that rf was the optimum technique for its higher accuracy and lower data requirements recently wu et al 2022 implemented ml algorithms to predict rld using other easily observable information including soil water content swc ssc leaf area index lai dry matter dm and root depth rd however although the potential of ml for rld prediction has been illustrated few studies have discussed the feasibility of coupling ml models of rld ml rld into crop models the preferred ml models for simulating rld combined with crop models are yet unknown moreover further investigation is required to evaluate the simulation performance of ml rld in terms of swc ssc and crop growth compared to the nrld method employed in the crop model to address these issues taking two years of field experiments with sunflower as the background three ml models of rf gpr and xgboost were developed to predict the rld then by coupling with a crop model swap the swc ssc and crop growth indicators of lai and dm were simulated respectively the study aimed to achieve two objectives 1 assess the applicability of the ml rld for coupling with the swap model 2 identify the suitable ml rld for simulating swc ssc and crop growth indicators 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental background the field experiments were conducted in three natural saline fields s1 s2 and s3 in 2016 and 2017 at the yichang experimental station 41 04 15 n 108 00 29 e located in the hetao irrigation district of inner mongolia china the data were collected from 2016 noted as 2016s1 2016s2 2016s3 and from 2017 as 2017s1 2017s2 and 2017s3 the volumetric swc and ssc in each field were measured at a depth of 0 100 cm the soil sampling depth intervals were 10 cm from the top 0 40 cm and 20 cm from 40 to 100 cm the soil samples were collected 30 51 65 and 106 days after sowing das in 2016 and at 28 58 68 78 and 110 das in 2017 respectively swc was measured by oven drying at 105 for 8 h ssc was indicated by the electrical conductivity of the saturated paste extracts of soil ece which was converted by ec1 5 the ec1 5 was measured as the electrical conductivity of soil solution with dry soil and deionized water and the mixed volume ratio of both was 1 5 in 2016 before sowing the average ece values at a depth of 0 100 cm in three fields s1 s2 and s3 were 1 72 2 71 ds m 1 3 51 5 90 ds m 1 and 7 54 10 32 ds m 1 respectively in 2017 the average ece values in the same three fields were relatively lower ranging from 1 07 to 2 84 1 30 3 28 and 1 05 5 95 ds m 1 respectively these lower values were primarily due to the short interval between irrigation and soil sampling in 2017 while the ece value in s2 and s3 fields increased during the crop growth period the particle size distribution 0 100 cm in three fields was also measured by a laser particle size analyzer before the experiments table 1 moreover the meteorological data including temperature relative humidity solar radiation and precipitation were measured by an automatic meteorological station located about 20 m beside the study fields detailed meteorological information can be found in lei et al 2023 the sunflower helianthus annuus l was sowed on june 5 2016 and may 27 2017 and harvested on sep 19 2016 and sep 15 2017 respectively the crop growth indicators including lai dm rld and rd were measured during the whole crop growth period the maximum length l and width w of each leaf was measured at an interval of 7 days the leaf area la was calculated based on the empirical equation la 0 6564 l w proposed by chen 1984 lai was calculated according to the green leaf area per unit of ground area the dm of plants was measured at each growth stage with the fresh plant after oven dried to constant weight at 80 c the rld and rd were monitored from four parallel transparent rhizotubes which were diagonally inserted 45 to the horizontal into the soil in the middle of the two sowing rows with a horizontal interval of 1 m and the vertical depth of insertion was about 1 0 m the roots surrounding the rhizotubes were scanned at the interval of 7 10 days with a root 700 digital camera ecomatik munich germany layer by layer the vertical height of each scan layer was controlled to 15 cm the crop root length in each scanned image was distinguished with winrhizotron software regent instruments inc quebec canada the rld was converted by assuming that the equivalent soil thickness surrounding the rhizotubes was equal to 2 5 mm the rld and rd of the field were calculated by their average statuses in four parallel rhizotube images 2 2 swap model 2 2 1 model theory swap model is a physically

swap model version 4 the detailed crop growth process is described as analogous to the wofost model boogaard et al 1998 here we briefly introduce the simulations of lai and dm dm is the result of the daily accumulation of net crop assimilation anet kg ha 1 d 1 which is calculated as the difference between the daily assimilation amount agross kg ha 1 d 1 and maintenance respiratory consumption rm

plants tact tpot the values of rm kg ha 1 d 1 are related to many factors such as the maintenance respiration coefficient the senescence reduction coefficient and the daily average temperature lai simulation is mainly controlled by leaf growth rate and aging rate their quantitative methods are related to the ratio of actual and potential crop transpiration 13 w g r o s s s h o o t ξ s h o o t c

in the swap model the upper and bottom boundaries of the soil profile were controlled by atmospheric conditions and groundwater tables respectively the simulation starts on the sowing day and ends on the harvest day the initial conditions of the soil water and salt status were determined by experimental observations then taking the measured rld as inputs the parameters of the swap model related to crop growth soil water movement solute transport and rwu were selected for calibration using a parameter optimization software pest white et al 2020 exactly as the following steps first adjusted the phenological parameters to make the simulated phenological period of the crop consistent with the actual situation second calibrated the crop parameters based on the potential status of lai and dm which was assumed by 1 1 times crop growth status in a low salinity field third calibrated the soil water and solute transport parameters based on the measurements of swc and ssc to avoid the influence of simulation uncertainty in crop growth we modified the original swap model by selecting the daily linear interpolation of measured lai and rld as input the initial value of soil hydraulic parameters is predicted by the rosetta model with soil texture leaver fay et al 2011 fourth calibrated the drought and salinity stress parameters based on the measurements of lai and dm in each field the calibrated swap model parameters are listed in tables 2 3 2 3 ml rld models three ml models including rf xgboost and gpr were employed to predict rld these models utilized the input variables of swc ssc rd lai and das the hyperparameters of ml models were tuned based on the training dataset based on 2000 times random five fold cross validation the datasets of four fields 2016s1 2016s2 2016s3 and 2017s1 were selected to train the models while the remaining two fields 2017s2 2017s3 were used for testing the models specifically to assess the applicability of the ml models under different levels of soil salinity 2017s2 and 2017s3 are selected as the two testing fields 2 3 1 rf model random forest an ensemble tree learning model was widely applied in classiﬁcation and regression problems by its excellent compatibility and powerful ability to handle high dimensional data breiman 2001 timsina et al 2021 yang et al 2021 the rf model combines a multitude of decision trees where each tree is randomly sampled from the original dataset by a bootstrap method in addition at each node of the tree the best predictor was chosen from the candidate set rather than the whole dataset against overfitting dong et al 2021 for regression problems the ultimate result is calculated as the mean prediction of the individual integrated trees in the forest moreover to assess the variable influences on rld prediction the variable importance of rf was evaluated with indexes of incmse and incnodepurity incmse refers to the impacts when the variable changes its value showing the importance of the variable a higher value means more important dewi and chen 2019 incnodepurity represents the influence of each variable on the heterogeneity of observed values at each node of the classification trees furthermore the hyperparameters of rf were ntree and minleafsize the ntree represents the number of decision trees minleafsize refers to the minimum number of samples allowed in a leaf node of a decision tree the ntree and minleafsize were tuned as 275 and 1 in this study respectively 2 3 2 xgboost model xgboost is a computationally improved algorithm of gradient boosting tree based model developed by chen et al 2016 unlike the rf model training each tree independently xgboost grows trees on the residuals of the previous tree and builds new weak tree models concerning the negative gradient of the loss function which means it can learn from the previous errors natekin and knoll 2013 furthermore xgboost offers the possibility of penalizing the complexity of the trees to avoid overfitting and accelerate modeling speed an arduous problem for xgboost is the optimal selection of the complicated hyperparameters that are sensitive and significant against overfitting and low efficiency iatrou et al 2021 the variable importance indicators are three items gain cover and frequency the gain implies the relative contribution for the predictions like the incmse in rf the cover is the relative number of observations related to the variable nearly like the incnodepurity the frequency is the percentage representing the relative number of times a particular feature occurs in the trees of the model which will not be analyzed in our study for its mathematical intricacy the hyperparameters of xgboost were nrounds eta min child weight and max depth the nrounds specifies the number of boosting rounds or iterations to perform like the ntree of rf model the eta controls the step size at each boosting round to prevent overfitting the min child weight helps control overfitting by adding regularization to the model the max depth sets the maximum depth of each decision tree which allows the model to capture more complex relationships in the data in this study the nrounds eta min child weight and max depth were tuned as 500 0 1 4 and 6 respectively fig 1 2 3 3 gpr model gpr is a non parametric ml algorithm according to a probabilistic bayesian regression method williams and rasmussen 2006 in the gpr model the joint distribution of training and testing is a multidimensional gaussian process and the predicted distribution is obtained by conditioning on the training data camps valls et al 2016 obtained by the maximum log likelihood estimation the flexible kernel function covariance function automatically optimizes the hyperparameters in a nutshell gpr is characterized by remarkable performance on small sample size non parametric inference ﬂexibility and provide probabilistic signiﬁcance based on the automatic optimization algorithm of gpr no hyperparameters of gpr were tuned in this study 2 4 coupling of ml rld models and swap model the dynamic interactions of rld with lai swc and ssc were described by coupling ml rld models and the swap model fig 2 the coupling steps are as follows step 1 prepare the initial and boundary conditions of the simulated soil profile and calibrates soil water and solute transport parameters and crop parameters in the swap model described as section 2 2 2 step 2 run the swap model to simulate crop growth and soil water and salt movements step 3 select the outputs of the swap model including lai swc ssc and corresponding das as inputs to run the ml rld model for obtaining the predicted rld at that condition step 4 take the simulated rld in the ml rld model as inputs to run the swap model step 5 repeat steps 2 4 at each time step until the end of the simulation 2 5 evaluating the ml rld and swap coupling model taking a scenario simulated with the measured rld mr as a benchmark the simulation results of swc ssc lai and dm were compared in the different swap and ml rld coupling models in the mr scenario the daily rld distribution linearly interpolated with the measured rld distribution was selected as an input to run the swap model generally a better ml rld model means it has similar simulation results to the mr scenario moreover to demonstrate the superiority or limitation of the coupling model of ml rld and swap the original swap model was simulated based on the fitting results of a typical cubic polynomial function cpf of nrld the cpf was fitted with the

are shown in fig 4 the simulation accuracies of rld based on rf and xgboost models were better than the gpr model such as the rmse of rf and xgboost were 0 304 0 473 cm cm 3 which were lower than the gpr 0 364 0 663 cm cm 3 especially in the 2017s3 field gpr overestimated rld on 58 and 68 das while rf and xgboost predicted it in an acceptable range therefore the rf and xgboost models were selected to be coupled with the swap model in this study the variable importance of rf and xgboost models is shown in fig 5 for the xgboost model the apparent differences among different input variables were presented such as the gain values of lai and ssc approach 0 48 and 0 26 respectively which were obviously greater than the other input variables however for the rf model although the incmse of lai 0 22 was also greater than other variables the differences in incmse between these variables were smaller such as the incmse of swc ssc and rd were all around 0 14 0 16 the top three variables of the incnodepurity in rf were lai 37 0 ssc 26 4 and swc 14 6 in xgboost the top three variables of the cover were lai 0 29 swc 0 25 and ssc 0 24 3 2 soil water and salt content simulation as shown in fig 6 the swc generally decreased with some fluctuations and the variations of swc at the topsoils 0 40 cm were more obvious than in the deeper soil layers 40 100 cm such as in the 2016s2 field the swc at the topsoils gradually reduced from 0 3 to 0 37 cm3 cm 3 to 0 2 0 25 cm3 cm 3 during the crop growth period while an increasing fluctuation occurred nearly 80 das in the deeper soil layers the swc gradually decreased from 0 4 to 0 42 cm3 cm 3 to 0 2 0 25 cm3 cm 3 compared with the deeper soil layers the simulation differences of swc in the topsoils based on different rld models were more significant such as in the 2017s1 field the differences in swc between the mr and cpf scenarios were about 0 10 0 15 cm3 cm 3 in the topsoils while the deeper soil layers were less than 0 05 cm3 cm 3 moreover the averaged differences of simulated swc among the rld models ranged from 0 05 to 0 10 cm3 cm 3 mainly occurring in the late growth period of the crop as shown in table 4 the training accuracy of swc by three models cpf rf and xgboost was similar to the mr scenario with the difference among models in rmse and rrmse lower than 0 003 cm3 cm 3 and 0 008 respectively in two testing fields 2017s2 and 2017s3 all three models performed excellently with differences in rmse and rrmse under 0 007 cm3 cm 3 and 0 017 table 4 as shown in fig 7 the simulated ssc generally increased during the crop growth period but the increasing trend varied among different fields in 2016s1 and 2017s1 the ssc ranged between 3 and 12 mg cm 3 while for 2016s2 and 2017s2 the ssc increased from 8 to 20 mg cm 3 moreover the increases in topsoils were more significant than those in deeper soil layers for example in the 2016s3 field the ssc in the mr scenario and three different ml models increased from 6 to 30 mg cm 3 in topsoils and from 6 to 18 mg cm 3 in deeper soil layers besides the simulation accuracies of ssc with two ml models are slightly better than the cpf model and close to the mr scenario table 5 in most training fields 2016 s1 2016 s2 and 2016s3 rf and xgboost performed slightly better than the cpf model on rmse and rrmse the advantage lower than 0 1 mg cm 3 and 0 01 respectively but not on r2 the difference lower than 0 04 however in the training field 2017s1 the simulation accuracies of rf and xgboost models nse reached 0 567 and 0 580 respectively were comparable to the mr scenario nse reached 0 608 and obviously better than the cpf model nse reached 0 015 in the testing field of 2017s2 the rf and xgboost models performed better than the cpf model in all statistic indicators 3 3 crop growth simulation as shown in fig 8 the simulated lai showed distinct variances based on different rld models especially in the fields with high salinity the rf model exhibited high accuracy and excellent stability across all fields for example the rmse in the training fields were 0 89 0 44 0 82 and 1 22 respectively which were close to the mr scenario in contrast the cpf model performed worse than the rf model in most fields table 6 and showed instability and poor precision when simulating the fields with high salinity such as in the 2016s2 and 2017s3 fields the rrmse of the cpf model was higher by 0 222 0 282 than the rf model compared with the xgboost model the rf model got relatively higher accuracy in training fields such as in the 2016s2 2016s3 and 2017s1 fields with rrmse lower by 0 085 0 122 in the test fields the predicting capacity of the rf model was also excellent with rrmse within 0 201 0 399 the simulation performance of dm fig 9 with the ml rld models was better than with the cpf model table 7 especially in fields with high salinity 2016s3 and 2017s3 the rrmse of dm simulation with the ml models were 0 235 and 0 210 respectively which were obviously lower than those of the cpf model 0 469 and 0 599 moreover in testing fields 2017s2 and 2017s3 the nse of the dm simulations by rf 0 940 and 0 910 are obviously higher than that by the cpf model 0 584 and 0 074 although the accuracy difference between the rf and xgboost models in the testing fields was slight the performance of the rf model in the training fields was significantly better than that of the xgboost model for instance compared with the xgboost model the rrmse of the rf model in the 2016s1 and 2016s3 fields was lower by 0 039 and 0 147 4 discussion 4 1 performances of ml and cpf models of rld two kinds of models of ml and cpf were employed to predict the rld dynamics and coupling with the swap model in this study the difference between the two models is that the ml model could describe dynamic interactions between the rld and relevant factors while the cpf model could not previous studies have shown that the nrld distribution of some crops such as cotton wheat maize and rice could be well quantified by the polynomial functions under different soil water situations ning et al 2019 however in this study poor fitting performances of nrld were obtained especially in the high salinity fields fig 3 r2 0 03 in 2017s3 unlike the cpf model the swc ssc and lai were selected as inputs to predict the rld in the ml models owing to the tremendous high dimensional non linear fitting ability ji et al 2021 wang and li 2019 satisfying simulated results of rld were obtained in ml models fig 4 r2 0 59 rmse 0 43 cm cm 3 in the rf and xgboost models in two test fields the rld is one of the essential variables for calculating the rwu which is a sink term in the richards equation to quantify the dynamics of swc however the differences in simulated swc based on different rld models were slight this could be attributed to the limited influences of rwu on soil water status and other environmental factors such as soil physical properties groundwater table and meteorological conditions could play a dominant role in soil water movement kargas et al 2016 konapala et al 2020 lei et al 2019 moreover the simulated rwu in the feddes model could be insensitive to the variations of rld distribution especially in high salt and dry situations the soil water salt status could primarily affect rwu patterns but the differences in simulated swc in the topsoils 0 40 cm were slightly greater than that in the deeper layers 40 100 cm fig 6 it was because of the relatively high rld in the topsoils which leads to a high rwu and has a greater impact on the swc the dynamic of ssc is related to the dynamics of soil water and salt transport parameters similar to the simulated swc with the different rld models the simulated ssc did not present an apparent difference except in the topsoils nonetheless the ml models performed outstandingly in both training and testing fields during swc and ssc simulations while the cpf model had weaker predictions in the 2017s1 and 2017s2 fields compared with simulated swc and ssc the simulated lai and dm presented greater divergence based on different rld models these results should be attributed to the crop modeling theory in the swap model kroes et al 2017 the differences in the simulated rld affect the potential rwu pattern and change the soil water salt stress factor thereby restricting the crop s actual transpiration then the ratio of actual transpiration to potential transpiration determines crops daily biomass assimilation rate and leaf aging death rate in the swap model van dam et al 2008 therefore the different rld models led to a disparate and noticeable impact on the crop growth simulation our study showed slight differences between the cpf and ml models in low salinity fields such as 2016s1 and 2017s1 nevertheless in high salinity fields such as 2016s3 and 2017s3 a significant deviation in lai and dm simulations was presented between cpf and ml models this is due to the cpf model s assumption of a constant nrld throughout the entire growing season which could not describe the dynamic changes of the rld under varying soil water and salinity stresses ma et al 2021 wu et al 2022 thereby restricting the simulation accuracy of crop growth 4 2 ml model selection although numerous ml models and their hybrid approaches have been proposed the suitability of each model for different applications remains unclear xu et al 2021 many studies obtained inconsistent results in ml models due to variations in datasets and objectives loggenberg et al 2018 watson hernandez et al 2022 for example liu et al 2021 found that xgboost obtained higher accuracy than rf in the lai simulation from multispectral images however aasim et al 2022 concluded that rf exhibited better predictions than xgboost for optimizing in vitro germination and growth indices of industrial hemp in this study the accuracy of the gpr model was lower than the other two models in the testing fields it should be attributed to the overfitting of the gpr model similar results were reported by cosenza et al 2022 especially when fitting small and insufficient datasets with some outliers mao et al 2019 regarding the two tree based ensemble ml models the rf and xgboost models demonstrated comparable accuracy across the six fields however the rf model showed superior precision and stability in all fields this was because the rf and xgboost models captured different information from input variables although both models considered lai as the most important input variable the essential differences between lai and other variables were distinct in these two models the xgboost model assessed higher importance to lai with a gain value of up to 0 474 thereby reducing the reliance on other variables such as ssc and swc this limited the potential influence of soil environments on rld simulation meanwhile the lai simulation error might significantly affect the simulation accuracy of rld in the xgboost model especially in the high salinity field such as 2016s3 on the contrary the rf model considered the importance of various input variables more equally taking into account the comprehensive effects of lai swc and ssc this enhanced the stability and robustness of the simulations moreover the variable importance analysis gave us more perspectives to understand the intricate relationships between targets and labels in this study when the rf and the xgboost models invested identical resources to simulate ssc and swc the reward of the ssc was approximately twice as much as that of the swc in two ml models fig 5 the phenomena revealed that the ssc was more heterogeneous and unequable than the swc which is also a clue that the ssc has a significant impact on the rld in the soil environment in our study 4 3 limitations and outlooks for the swap and ml rld coupling model this study found an efficient ml model rf of rld that is appropriate for coupling with the swap model which could be a potential strategy to improve crop modeling under various environmental influences with the appropriate coupling of swap and ml rld data we effectively simulated the water and salt dynamics and crop growth indicators in different saline fields which indicates parameter calibration is reliable in this study however there remain some uncertainties in the parameter calibration due to limited observations for instance in the crop parameters calibration we amplified the crop growth indicators in a low salinity field to represent the potential growth state of the crop while the amplification factor may affect the calibration results of water and salinity stress parameters and subsequently alter the crop growth simulation additionally to pre calibrate the swap model parameters we use linear daily interpolation of measured rld as input although the fact that we observe roots quite frequently our observations still cannot fully represent the actual growth conditions of the roots moreover soil physical properties exhibit strong spatial variability at the field scale while we did not directly measure soil hydraulic parameters and solute transport parameters which may affect the simulation results of soil water and salt movements therefore we encourage optimizing the physical model parameters based on more comprehensive and detailed experimental observations in further study as well as testing the coupling performances of different ml models of rld and crop models in more scenarios such as for different crop varieties grown in different soil types and weather conditions 5 conclusions and outlooks root dynamics quantification is a challenging issue that directly impacts crop growth simulation results in this study three ml models including rf gpr and xgboost were developed to predict the rld of sunflowers in different salinity fields the rld simulations showed the rf and xgboost rmse within 0 304 0 473 cm cm 3 model performed more steadily and accurately than gpr rmse within 0 364 0 663 cm cm 3 in the test fields to quantify the dynamic interactions between rld and related variables we innovatively coupled them with a typical physical based crop model swap in crop growth simulations the ml models demonstrated obvious advantages over the traditional cpf model the poor fitting performances of the cpf model in several high salinity fields limited its accuracy in lai simulation the rrmse in the rf model was 0 222 0 282 lower than in the cpf the results illustrate ml models have great potential to quantify rld dynamics and improve crop modeling performances furthermore compared with the xgboost model the rf model generally exhibited superior precision and stability for simulating swc ssc and crop growth due to fairly capturing information from input variables for the lai and dm simulations in several training fields the rrmse in the rf model was lower than in the xgboost model by 0 085 0 122 and 0 038 0 147 these results are beneficial for exploring an appropriate ml model for rld simulation in the coupling model and understanding the factors influencing their performances further studies are encouraged to expand the coupling models with different ml and physical based crop models and explore the application in more scenarios such as different crop varieties and environmental conditions

bankside vegetation p in first 10 cm of sediment p in dredged plant material p in top 20 cm of peat soil p in water column to determine the significant phosphorus reservoirs and main cycling pathways of p through a peatland porewater surface water system a number of parameters need determining and assumptions made to fill in gaps in data knowledge loadings require a combination of concentrations p mass per unit area or mass and a volume litres of surface or pore water kilograms of soil sediment or biomass the mass balance for west sedgemoor relied on geographic information systems gis analysis using arcmap pro to estimate areas of land and water across the moor the ditches were split into three types large 3 m width medium 1 9 3 m width and small 1 9 m width their lengths were calculated using arcgis pro then a total volume of water present was calculated by multiplying an average depth of 2 1 5 and 1 m for the large medium and small ditches respectively the volume was multiplied by a typical mean concentration of total p in the water of 0 3 mg p l for all types of ditches to derive a load sediment loads were assumed to be related to the first 10 cm of sediment and mean concentrations from core data collected in the field derived a concentration of 1311 1191 and 1223 mg p kg dry weight for large medium and small ditches respectively a volume was generated assuming a density of 1800 kg m3 allowing a p load in the top 10 cm of sediment to be calculated the soil p reservoir was calculated from measured by subtracting the area of water on west sedgemoor from the total area and converting to a volume using a density of 1330 kg m3 then multiplying by a concentration of 2447 mg p kg dry weight a mean of soil data from 10 cores down to a depth of 20 cm to calculate a load of p held within the soil the p load held within floating vegetation was predicted by taking the concentration measured in lemna 5 sites and 3 replicates of 323 203 and 328 mg p m2 of

from measured data for ditch dredging plant material mean of 150 g p m of bank by length of banks taken from the gis analysis phosphorus in dredged material heaped onto the bankside was generated from assuming a loading of 150 g p m of bank multiplied by length of ditch dredged per year assuming a 5 year cycle of dredging ditches greater than 1 9 m in width literature data were used to estimate p

together typical rainwater p concentrations 0 0304 mg p l berthold et al 2019 by annual rainfall of 846 mm on the area of land and water within west sedgemoor 3 results 3 1 water quality moorlinch a known nutrient contaminated site from extensive arable cropping in the 1970 s carrots shows particularly elevated ditch annual mean 0 16 mg p l seasonal mean range 0 12 0 19 mg p l and sediment pore water annual mean 1 39 mg p l seasonal mean range 0 26 0 211 mg p l concentrations of total phosphorus over 10 times the compliance value table s3 nailsea and west sedgemoor exhibit high levels of non compliance 76 with levels annual mean 0 22 mg p l seasonal mean range 0 09 0 44 mg p l up to 4 times the standard and no improvement between 2015 and 16 and 2019 20 table s2 these data alongside river p data collected by the environment agency and wessex water support the natural england decision to change the condition status for the somerset levels and moors sssi ditch systems to unfavourable declining a similar downgrading of status is also in progress for the nailsea site 3 2 groundwater quality at west sedgemoor concentrations of p varied spatially and temporally with mean srp in ditches of 0 6 mg p l range 0 05 0 44 mg p l with values almost always greater than the 0 1 mg p l limit set for the drainage system fig s3 groundwater within the peat at west sedgemoor had p concentrations ranging from 0 95 to 4 2 mg p l with a mean of 1 5 mg p l fig s6 therefore the peat sediment is contaminated with of p to a greater degree than water in the ditches there was no clear impact of dredging on concentrations the variation in concentrations appears to be mainly driven by dilution with rainwater and physico chemical processes within the largely anoxic peat profile data for moorlinch supported this assumption with groundwater concentrations of a similar or greater magnitude to those of west sedgemoor only 7 out of 102 samples 0 1 mg p l concentrations appeared to reflect combinations of rainfall fig s4 which leads to dilution of concentrations as well as biogeochemistry associated with controlling factors such as iron speciation related to high water levels leading to anoxia in the peat formation of soluble reduced iron which in turn solubilises the p table s3 mean and median nitrate concentrations in peat body waters ranged from 1 9 to 2 5 mg n l fig s5 the highest concentrations of 2 5 mg n l occurred in the surface waters with no significant difference p 0 05 between waters nitrate readings in river waters of less than 1 0 mg n l is considered excellent seasonal differences occurred in median nitrate water concentrations winter january 2021 available n was significantly higher p 0 05 than levels recorded at the peak of the growing season june 2021 across all sample sites 3 3 inlet water quality all data for rivers in the wessex catchment which supply the slms was downloaded from the environment agency s data archive ea 2022 the data shows that there is a general ongoing improvement in water quality with often step changes associated with upgrades of wwtw to reduce p in the effluent however the data also shows that most rivers supplying water to the levels are still significantly contaminated and greater than 0 1 mg p l as orthophosphate the equivalent of total reactive phosphate a conservative measure for tp table 2 shows that compliance is poor particularly for king s sedgemoor drain the rivers cary yeo and parrett although further reductions in p loads are planned in the next five years for example a further 50 reduction of wwtw discharge to the parrett wessex water 2018 without reductions in agricultural runoff concentrations are unlikely to fall below 0 1 mg p l 3 4 cattle manure and bird guano it has been reported that cows on average excrete 53 g p day defra 2006 as an example for west sedgemoor there is an average of 1700 cows grazing on the moor for six months of the year this equates to a p load from manure of 16 479 kg p yr see fig 3 an average 2015 2018 data of 19 213 birds across 26 species over winter on west sedgemoor per year rspb pers comms 2020 combining bird numbers with data for p excretion hahn et al 2007 provided a load where p excretion data were not available for specific bird species loads were estimated based on the relationship between reported mass of bird known for all species at west sedgemoor versus p excreta known for 10 of the 26 bird species observed at the site p excreted g d 0 0579 x mass of bird g r2 0 9439 using this approach a total load of p from birds was estimated to be 522 kg p yr significantly less than that from cattle see fig 3 the majority of the p inputs from cattle and birds are likely to have originated from vegetation consumed from within the site s catchment closed loop the most significant impacts to water quality will result from redistribution and increases in nutrient bioavailability of phosphorus 3 5 atmospheric deposition atmospheric concentrations of p are low and deposition is not considered a significant source of p to the uk environment comber et al 2013 however over a large surface area amounts can be significant and easily calculated excluding dry deposition to give 1642 kg p yr from this source 3 6 internal loadings sediment and peat sediment background concentrations for p are typically 500 mg kg dry weight crocker et al 2021 however detailed spatial analysis of west sedgemoor has shown concentrations are at least twice this level and up to almost 10 times background in places crocker et al 2021 fig s6 similarly high levels of p have been reported downstream of intensive agriculture and industry discharges such as dairies burns et al 2015 elevated concentrations were influenced by contaminated river feedwaters fig 2 sediment core data fig 4 typically showed elevated levels in the upper layers likely to reflect post war intensification and nutrient use as well as p mobilisation within the sediment mean concentrations of total p within the top 10 cm of sediments pore water were calculated section 2 7 to be 140 tons fig 3 fig 4 shows that concentrations of p in the soil are not dissimilar to those in the sediment 1000 3500 mg p kg fig s7 with some evidence of a trend towards concentrations decreasing away from the ditch banks fig s7 reported p concentrations in 20 bulk soil samples collected across three catchments in england and wales reports a range of 200 2000 mg p kg with a mean of 889 mg p kg adams et al 2020 which is significantly lower than values for sediments measured at west sedgemoor fig 4 peat core samples fig 5 from 10 sites at moorlinch showed a surface maximum although levels were lower than observed at west sedgemoor which may reflect analytical differences total xrf for sedgemoor vs acid extractable aqua regia digestions at moorlinch 3 7 internal loadings vegetation concentrations of p were measured in floating duckweed lemna minor on the ditches of west sedgemoor over the course of a year giving a mean of 4 4 g kg dry weight n 48 sd 1 2 g kg furthermore bankside vegetation dredged from the ditches as part of a maintenance programme was washed and determined for tp nine samples were taken from each of three sites a1 a2 a3 fig s2 giving mean concentrations of 16 6 18 1 and 32 8 g p kg dry weight respectively the variability likely to reflect the different plant species present in the dredgings overall the mean was 22 5 g p kg n 27 sd 8 4 mg kg which was significantly higher than that of the duckweed previous reports state the reed phragmites australis can contain between 2 and up to 10 g p kg 1 kobbing et al 2013 lower concentrations have been reported elsewhere only up to 1 g p kg but soil p concentrations were only up to 600 mg kg ge et al 2017 lower than observed in the samples on the slms 4 discussion in slms failure of ditch water quality standards for p are determined by a combination of factors including water sources inflow rates residence times internal nutrient cycling and rates of outflows it is therefore essential to quantify the loads from the main sources including river supply manure and guano inputs sediment adsorption desorption processes and soil groundwater surface water interactions calculation of p stocks in soil sediment water and vegetation also provides an indication of priorities regarding any remediation involving export of p from the site 4 1 options for improving water quality given the available data presented above it is possible to generate a mass balance of p present within the specific environmental compartments for the most studied area west sedgemoor fig 3 which indicates considerable p reservoirs in the peat followed by the sediment then emergent plants there is also the potential for considerable exchange of p between the different environmental compartments owing to the connectivity between the water unconsolidated sediment and bankside peaty soil this suggests that any remediation will require a holistic approach to removing p from the system thus preventing the cycling currently associated with the minimal exchange of water available across hydrologically inactive and often isolated systems the data indicates significant pollution within the slms it is clear that improvements can only be made by a combination of reducing input loadings to the system from contaminated rivers and removal of legacy p from the sites themselves there are a number of options regarding remediation that are explored in table 3 4 2 improving inflow water quality wessex water operate 155 wwtw 601 sewage pumping stations and 311 storm overflows within catchments such as the parrett tone bristol avon brue and axe which provide feed water into the slms ongoing investment has seen significant load reductions of p 108 tonnes per year between 2015 and 2020 with a further 70 tonnes per year to be removed by 2025 for example this will half the current load of p coming from wessex water wwtw within the parrett catchment wessex water 2021 furthermore there are agricultural schemes to reduce p loads to catchments such as agri environment schemes which are being transitioned to environmental land management schemes elms environment agency 2019 nutrient neutrality mitigation methodologies natural england 2022 and catchment market approaches such as entrade employed within the wessex catchments entrade 2023 the effectiveness of farm management practices are not as easily measured as those for wwtw discharges and so the improvements proposed by elms in combination with catchment sensitive farming csf is unclear existing data for csf and linked agri environment incentives have only shown to deliver a modest reduction in p loading 5 10 environment agency 2019 use of proportionate regulation alongside incentives for landowners to provide nature based solutions and innovative trading schemes such as entrade are currently the cornerstones of future reduction of agricultural inputs novel schemes to export farmyard slurries and manures doody et al 2020 to locations outside of the slms catchments to sites where there is demonstrable crop need may also be required paludiculture systems at inlets to ramsar sites could serve to reduce incoming loads the p being actively accumulated into plant crop biomass see section 4 6 however the sites would have to be managed and vegetation removed to export p offsite for use in energy generation or in building materials otherwise yet further recycling of p will prevail 4 3 altering water level management to mobilise and export phosphorus existing data suggests that raising water levels to restore peatlands leads to anoxia within the peat as it floods the chemically reducing conditions lead to solubilisation of manganese compounds and particularly iron species which in turn release soluble p bound to these redox sensitive substances into the porewater zak et al 2010 gelbrecht 2007 van diggelen et al 2014 and van de riet et al 2013 report p mobilization rates from rewetted fertilized peatlands of 10 50 kg p ha y the soluble p is then available for mobilisation and transport from the wetland system potentially spreading eutrophication on a wider scale the increase in available p could also be harnessed to grow a wet crop via paludiculture section 4 6 however there would likely be short term impacts on ecology which would have to be traded against longer term objectives table 3 4 4 nutrient removal in ditches via the of export of dredged sediment dredging of ditches on the slms occurs as part of a maintenance regime to keep the waterways open for the purposes of wet fences for cattle segregation and as part of the wider water level and flood risk management dredged material sediment plant material and water is placed on the bank within 5 m of the ditch the dredging stirs up the unconsolidated sediment and significantly increases the suspended solid concentrations in the water column schindler and comber 2021 following dredging tp levels significantly exceed the 0 1 mg p l level the disturbance is a temporary effect lasting around one week before returning to p concentrations typical of the ditch before the perturbation as already noted concentrations of p in dredged plant and sediment are high so if dredgings are exported this may contribute to reducing the legacy p problem in the slms excessively frequent ditch dredging however can have significant negative impacts on aquatic ecology leading to floating plant domination van zuidam and peeters 2013 so a balance must be struck between the rate of p export the need to mitigate against the harmful effects of eutrophication and the maintenance of hydroseral succession table 3 the costs of removing vegetation from site also have to be taken into account 4 5 export of nutrients by topsoil removal the data presented in figs 4 and 5 show higher concentrations of p in the upper peat layers making topsoil removal advantageous although problematic in terms of identifying an outlet for the topsoil once removed and the associated financial costs however topsoil removal can be used to create isolated rain fed scrapes with lower levels of n and p cabezas et al 2014 and has been undertaken in peatland restoration especially for former agricultural peatlands with high surface peat nutrient content where rewetting alone can risk excessive nutrient and methane emissions harpenslager et al 2015 zak et al 2017 based on limited data it has been successful in boreal and temperate regions for nutrient management and remediation emsens et al 2015 but there are obvious implications for ecosystem services table 3 4 6 biogeochemical restoration paludiculture and rewetting paludiculture is a cost appropriate management solution table 3 which has the potential to generate an alternative source of income for farmers and landowners whilst reducing summer concentrations of p and n in inflow water to wetland ramsar sites land et al 2016 geurts et al 2020 vroom et al 2022 in a review of 93 papers land et al 2016 found median removal rates of tn and tp of 93 and 1 2 g m2 yr respectively removal efficiencies are correlated with inlet concentrations loading rate retention time and annual average air temperature however given the practical difficulties of creating and managing integrated constructed wetlands on water feeds to the slms ramsar such as the lack of gradient and flow paludiculture may provide a more feasible option to remove p and reduce the damaging effects of excessive plant growth only one plant macronutrient needs to be growth rate limiting schindler et al 2008 in mineral soils and freshwater bodies that nutrient is normally p tallowin and jefferson 1999 zak et al 2010 however in static water bodies over peat with lower o2 concentrations and redox potential n may become plant growth rate limiting van duren and pegtel 2000 vroom et al 2022 under anaerobic conditions denitrification and loss of n is stimulated as facultative anaerobic bacteria use nitrate no3 instead of oxygen o2 as the terminal electron acceptor vroom et al 2022 analysis of summer n concentrations in peatland water bodies and ditches suggest that available n is rapidly assimilated during spring plant growth and therefore could limit p influenced eutrophication paludiculture has the potential to combine peat preservation carbon sequestration and the removal of legacy nutrients from water and peat bodies to control nutrient effluxes at the landscape scale whilst producing commercially viable plant biomass geurts et al 2020 zak mcinnes 2022 phragmites australis has been reported to contain between 2 and up to 10 g p kg 1 kobbing et al 2013 however lower p concentrations have been reported 1 g p kg where soil p concentrations were only up to 600 mg kg ge et al 2017 lower than observed in the samples on the slms typha is reported geurts et al 2020 to have the highest removal rates of p under high n availability however based on our 1 g p kg peat concentrations a 1 dry matter p content and a 10 t ha yr dry weight crop biomass as shown by our data it would take an estimated 100 typha harvests to remove legacy p 1 kg p m 2 from the peat body on the slms and several hundred harvests at the lower end growth rates report for phragmites and also typha geurts et al 2020 fig 6 shows a schematic representation of the effects of rewetting on p mobilization in the water column and peat body following rewetting the previously oxygenated surface layers of peat become anoxic the resulting redox conditions increase the mobility and bioavailability of p reducing in situ peat p concentrations schindler and comber 2021 the absence of o2 also results in the denitrification of mineralized n denitrification caused by rewetting combined with plant uptake can result in n becoming a plant growth limiting nutrient if n becomes limiting in the water body and inflow waters can be kept below 1 mg n l vroom et al 2022 this can neutralise the damaging effects of excessive plant growth from accumulated p given time n limitation will result in an increase in the diversity of emergent wetland plants irrespective of the availability of p removal of available p and n from the water column can be achieved by the placement of paludiculture crops in inflow waters along main drains to act as nutrient buffer zones walton et al 2020 where high nutrient waters drain from adjacent intensively managed agricultural land under rewetted anoxic conditions mobilised p could then be exported from the fen peat system to estuarine waters using a sustainable pump system overtime drawing down legacy p that has built up in the peat body over decades of inputs from nutrient rich inflows it is also possible that the mobilization of p could alter n cycling by stimulating organic n mineralization with resulting flux of ammonium and dissolved organic n zak et al 2010 in water bodies over peat with low conveyance or the absence of an n rich inflow a typha paludiculture crop is likely to become n growth rate limiting within 2 5 harvests vroom et al 2022 as there are several unknowns this strategy would need to be tested in experimental paludiculture field trials more research is required to adequately predict potential impacts from hydrological restoration and paludiculture crops sandin et al 2022 the diversity of emergent vegetation is likely to increase with n limitation and lower competition however at the water air interface oxygenation of surface layers may result in the excessive growth of floating lemna in unshaded water environments where rewetting has increased the mobilization of p peeters et al 2013 invasive floating aquatic plants such as azolla which is a problem species in the slms have n fixing capabilities and therefore may not be controlled by n limitation alone 5 conclusions the data presented in this paper clearly indicates p legacy and ongoing p pollution of the somerset levels ramsar site this can only be remediated via a combination of reducing the input concentrations to below the ditch quality standard currently 0 1 mg p l but this may need to be even lower and removing the legacy p pollution locked up in the peat and sediment an increasing body of evidence shows that although significant efforts are being employed by the relevant water company over the next 5 years to reduce loads of p to the slms this is unlikely to be sufficient for site restoration given inflow water pollution from agriculture and ongoing water level and flood risk management approaches a more sustainable vision for the slms would include naturally functioning wetland ecosystems with nutrient buffer zones lower internal water conveyance and a greater proportion of wetland habitats that are fen or wet woodland whilst in the short term this could have some negative implications for habitat diversity and specialist wet grassland species table 3 in the long term there would be significant benefits to ecosystem function paludiculture could help in the transition to higher summer wet levels and has the potential to reduce legacy p however experimental trials of paludiculture crops would be required to fully evaluate the

8851,eutrophication of wetlands caused by urban industrial and agricultural run off is an important environmental problem eutrophication is characterized by excessive plant and algal growth due to the increased availability of one or more growth limiting nutrients in freshwater generally considered to be controlled by the bioavailability of phosphorus p the somerset levels and moors slms catchments are subject to intensive agriculture and wastewater inputs which leads to nutrient contamination of the inflow waters to the extent that they fail water framework directive good status targets for p concentrations in 2021 natural england downgraded the status of the slms sites of special scientific interest sssis to unfavourable declining owing to poor water quality mostly associated with p concentrations and associated duckweed and filamentous algal blooms macro plant nutrient concentrations were analysed in ditches dipwells soil sediment and harvested plant biomass across a number of sites to provide an assessment of the overall apportionment of p inputs and reservoirs here we present a combined dataset of stores fluxes and loadings of p the data show large temporal and spatial changes in the concentrations of p and nitrogen n across the peat rich soils we suggest how an altered hydrological regime and plant biomass harvesting could be used to reduce further eutrophication and how legacy p stored in the peat body could be mobilized by flooding and over time evacuated from the wetland the findings suggest how paludiculture wet agricultural crops and rewetting of the peat body may help to restore the ramsar wetland we discuss how complex biogeochemical interactions occur during the rewetting process and how the need to export p via new land management mitigation

well as providing an income for farmers and contributing to the uk s commitment to net zero carbon emissions by 2050 the common standards monitoring guidance jncc 2005 for the assessment of ditch sssis states that total phosphorus tp should be less than 0 1 mg tp l to be in favourable condition above this concentration there is a high risk that the adverse biological effects of nutrient enrichment will occur leading to excessive growth of plant species such as lemna duckweed and filamentous algae that shade or smother other aquatic life respectively the potential sources of excess phosphate in the surface waters of the levels include the river inputs to the levels themselves contaminated from wastewater treatment works wwtw effluent and diffuse agricultural pollution fertiliser

years a considerable amount of data have been independently generated across a number of sites for various purposes and it is timely to collate and analyse these data in order to feed into a strategy to improve water quality across the slms although for a number of studies soluble reactive and total reactive phosphorus was determined for this data analysis because the slm phosphorus target is tp only this fraction has been assessed and reported in detail here monitoring and research into soil sediment ground and surface water quality sources of pollution the biogeochemical cycling of phosphate and impacts on biodiversity within these rich ecosystems has been fragmented the aim of this research has been to collate existing information to provide a thorough data evidence review to inform the current magnitude of contamination and to consider options for future restoration of heavily phosphate polluted water sediment and soil throughout the slms 2 methods the somerset levels and moors slms occupy an area of approximately 70 000 ha in the county of somerset england with 6388 non contiguous hectares of this designated in 1997 under the ramsar convention fig 2 the inland wetland

bankside vegetation p in first 10 cm of sediment p in dredged plant material p in top 20 cm of peat soil p in water column to determine the significant phosphorus reservoirs and main cycling pathways of p through a peatland porewater surface water system a number of parameters need determining and assumptions made to fill in gaps in data knowledge loadings require a combination of concentrations p mass per unit area or mass and a volume litres of surface or pore water kilograms of soil sediment or biomass the mass balance for west sedgemoor relied on geographic information systems gis analysis using arcmap pro to estimate areas of land and water across the moor the ditches were split into three types large 3 m width medium 1 9 3 m width and small 1 9 m width their lengths were calculated using arcgis pro then a total volume of water present was calculated by multiplying an average depth of 2 1 5 and 1 m for the large medium and small ditches respectively the volume was multiplied by a typical mean concentration of total p in the water of 0 3 mg p l for all types of ditches to derive a load sediment loads were assumed to be related to the first 10 cm of sediment and mean concentrations from core data collected in the field derived a concentration of 1311 1191 and 1223 mg p kg dry weight for large medium and small ditches respectively a volume was generated assuming a density of 1800 kg m3 allowing a p load in the top 10 cm of sediment to be calculated the soil p reservoir was calculated from measured by subtracting the area of water on west sedgemoor from the total area and converting to a volume using a density of 1330 kg m3 then multiplying by a concentration of 2447 mg p kg dry weight a mean of soil data from 10 cores down to a depth of 20 cm to calculate a load of p held within the soil the p load held within floating vegetation was predicted by taking the concentration measured in lemna 5 sites and 3 replicates of 323 203 and 328 mg p m2 of lemna coverage multiplied by a coverage percent estimated from site walk overs of 20 40 and 70 for large medium and small ditches respectively phosphorus held within bankside vegetation was predicted from measured data for ditch dredging plant material mean of 150 g p m of bank by length of banks taken from the gis analysis phosphorus in dredged material heaped onto the bankside was generated from assuming a loading of 150 g p m of bank multiplied by length of ditch dredged per year assuming a 5 year cycle of dredging ditches greater than 1 9 m in width literature data were used to estimate p loading from cattle manure bird guano and rainwater p concentrations bird population on the slm were taken from the wetland bird survey webs for west sedgemoor as a mean of 2015 16 2016 17 and 2017 18 data phosphorus content in guano was abstracted from hahn et al 2007 bird type and numbers could then be combined with p excretion rates to calculate a load loads from cattle were set as based on 53 g p cow day being excreted natural england 2009 multiplied by 1700 head of beef cattle grazing the west sedgemoor for 6 months of the year finally rainwater loads were simply calculated by multiplying together typical rainwater p concentrations 0 0304 mg p l berthold et al 2019 by annual rainfall of 846 mm on the area of land and water within west sedgemoor 3 results 3 1 water quality moorlinch a known nutrient contaminated site from extensive arable cropping in the 1970 s carrots shows particularly elevated ditch annual mean 0 16 mg p l seasonal mean range 0 12 0 19 mg p l and sediment pore water annual mean 1 39 mg p l seasonal mean range 0 26 0 211 mg p l concentrations of total phosphorus over 10 times the compliance value table s3 nailsea and west sedgemoor exhibit high levels of non compliance 76 with levels annual mean 0 22 mg p l seasonal mean range 0 09 0 44 mg p l up to 4 times the standard and no improvement between 2015 and 16 and 2019 20 table s2 these data alongside river p data collected by the environment agency and wessex water support the natural england decision to change the condition status for the somerset levels and moors sssi ditch systems to unfavourable declining a similar downgrading of status is also in progress for the nailsea site 3 2 groundwater quality at west sedgemoor concentrations of p varied spatially and temporally with mean srp in ditches of 0 6 mg p l range 0 05 0 44 mg p l with values almost always greater than the 0 1 mg p l limit set for the drainage system fig s3 groundwater within the peat at west sedgemoor had p concentrations ranging from 0 95 to 4 2 mg p l with a mean of 1 5 mg p l fig s6 therefore the peat sediment is contaminated with of p to a greater degree than water in the ditches there was no clear impact of dredging on concentrations the variation in concentrations appears to be mainly driven by dilution with rainwater and physico chemical processes within the largely anoxic peat profile data for moorlinch supported this assumption with groundwater concentrations of a similar or greater magnitude to those of west sedgemoor only 7 out of 102 samples 0 1 mg p l concentrations appeared to reflect combinations of rainfall fig s4 which leads to dilution of concentrations as well as biogeochemistry associated with controlling factors such as iron speciation related to high water levels leading to anoxia in the peat formation of soluble reduced iron which in turn solubilises the p table s3 mean and median nitrate concentrations in peat body waters ranged from 1 9 to 2 5 mg n l fig s5 the highest concentrations of 2 5 mg n l occurred in the surface waters with no significant difference p 0 05 between waters nitrate readings in river waters of less than 1 0 mg n l is considered excellent seasonal differences occurred in median nitrate water concentrations winter january 2021 available n was significantly higher p 0 05 than levels recorded at the peak of the growing season june 2021 across all sample sites 3 3 inlet water quality all data for rivers in the wessex catchment which supply the slms was downloaded from the environment agency s data archive ea 2022 the data shows that there is a general ongoing improvement in water quality with often step changes associated with upgrades of wwtw to reduce p in the effluent however the data also shows that most rivers supplying water to the levels are still significantly contaminated and greater than 0 1 mg p l as orthophosphate the equivalent of total reactive phosphate a conservative measure for tp table 2 shows that compliance is poor particularly for king s sedgemoor drain the rivers cary yeo and parrett although further reductions in p loads are planned in the next five years for example a further 50 reduction of wwtw discharge to the parrett wessex water 2018 without reductions in agricultural runoff concentrations are unlikely to fall below 0 1 mg p l 3 4 cattle manure and bird guano it has been reported that cows on average excrete 53 g p day defra 2006 as an example for west sedgemoor there is an average of 1700 cows grazing on the moor for six months of the year this equates to a p load from manure of 16 479 kg p yr see fig 3 an average 2015 2018 data of 19 213 birds across 26 species over winter on west sedgemoor per year rspb pers comms 2020 combining bird numbers with data for p excretion hahn et al 2007 provided a load where p excretion data were not available for specific bird species loads were estimated based on the relationship between reported mass of bird known for all species at west sedgemoor versus p excreta known for 10 of the 26 bird species observed at the site p excreted g d 0 0579 x mass of bird g r2 0 9439 using this approach a total load of p from birds was estimated to be 522 kg p yr significantly less than that from cattle see fig 3 the majority of the p inputs from cattle and birds are likely to have originated from vegetation consumed from within the site s catchment closed loop the most significant impacts to water quality will result from redistribution and increases in nutrient bioavailability of phosphorus 3 5 atmospheric deposition atmospheric concentrations of p are low and deposition is not considered a significant source of p to the uk environment comber et al 2013 however over a large surface area amounts can be significant and easily calculated excluding dry deposition to give 1642 kg p yr from this source 3 6 internal loadings sediment and peat sediment background concentrations for p are typically 500 mg kg dry weight crocker et al 2021 however detailed spatial analysis of west sedgemoor has shown concentrations are at least twice this level and up to almost 10 times background in places crocker et al 2021 fig s6 similarly high levels of p have been reported downstream of intensive agriculture and industry discharges such as dairies burns et al 2015 elevated concentrations were influenced by contaminated river feedwaters fig 2 sediment core data fig 4 typically showed elevated levels in the upper layers likely to reflect post war intensification and nutrient use as well as p mobilisation within the sediment mean concentrations of total p within the top 10 cm of sediments pore water were calculated section 2 7 to be 140 tons fig 3 fig 4 shows that concentrations of p in the soil are not dissimilar to those in the sediment 1000 3500 mg p kg fig s7 with some evidence of a trend towards concentrations decreasing away from the ditch banks fig s7 reported p concentrations in 20 bulk soil samples collected across three catchments in england and wales reports a range of 200 2000 mg p kg with a mean of 889 mg p kg adams et al 2020 which is significantly lower than values for sediments measured at west sedgemoor fig 4 peat core samples fig 5 from 10 sites at moorlinch showed a surface maximum although levels were lower than observed at west sedgemoor which may reflect analytical differences total xrf for sedgemoor vs acid extractable aqua regia digestions at moorlinch 3 7 internal loadings vegetation concentrations of p were measured in floating duckweed lemna minor on the ditches of west sedgemoor over the course of a year giving a mean of 4 4 g kg dry weight n 48 sd 1 2 g kg furthermore bankside vegetation dredged from the ditches as part of a maintenance programme was washed and determined for tp nine samples were taken from each of three sites a1 a2 a3 fig s2 giving mean concentrations of 16 6 18 1 and 32 8 g p kg dry weight respectively the variability likely to reflect the different plant species present in the dredgings overall the mean was 22 5 g p kg n 27 sd 8 4 mg kg which was significantly higher than that of the duckweed previous reports state the reed phragmites australis can contain between 2 and up to 10 g p kg 1 kobbing et al 2013 lower concentrations have been reported elsewhere only up to 1 g p kg but soil p concentrations were only up to 600 mg kg ge et al 2017 lower than observed in the samples on the slms 4 discussion in slms failure of ditch water quality standards for p are determined by a combination of factors including water sources inflow rates residence times internal nutrient cycling and rates of outflows it is therefore essential to quantify the loads from the main sources including river supply manure and guano inputs sediment adsorption desorption processes and soil groundwater surface water interactions calculation of p stocks in soil sediment water and vegetation also provides an indication of priorities regarding any remediation involving export of p from the site 4 1 options for improving water quality given the available data presented above it is possible to generate a mass balance of p present within the specific environmental compartments for the most studied area west sedgemoor fig 3 which indicates considerable p reservoirs in the peat followed by the sediment then emergent plants there is also the potential for considerable exchange of p between the different environmental compartments owing to the connectivity between the water unconsolidated sediment and bankside peaty soil this suggests that any remediation will require a holistic approach to removing p from the system thus preventing the cycling currently associated with the minimal exchange of water available across hydrologically inactive and often isolated systems the data indicates significant pollution within the slms it is clear that improvements can only be made by a combination of reducing input loadings to the system from contaminated rivers and removal of legacy p from the sites themselves there are a number of options regarding remediation that are explored in table 3 4 2 improving inflow water quality wessex water operate 155 wwtw 601 sewage pumping stations and 311 storm overflows within catchments such as the parrett tone bristol avon brue and axe which provide feed water into the slms ongoing investment has seen significant load reductions of p 108 tonnes per year between 2015 and 2020 with a further 70 tonnes per year to be removed by 2025 for example this will half the current load of p coming from wessex water wwtw within the parrett catchment wessex water 2021 furthermore there are agricultural schemes to reduce p loads to catchments such as agri environment schemes which are being transitioned to environmental land management schemes elms environment agency 2019 nutrient neutrality mitigation methodologies natural england 2022 and catchment market approaches such as entrade employed within the wessex catchments entrade 2023 the effectiveness of farm management practices are not as easily measured as those for wwtw discharges and so the improvements proposed by elms in combination with catchment sensitive farming csf is unclear existing data for csf and linked agri environment incentives have only shown to deliver a modest reduction in p loading 5 10 environment agency 2019 use of proportionate regulation alongside incentives for landowners to provide nature based solutions and innovative trading schemes such as entrade are currently the cornerstones of future reduction of agricultural inputs novel schemes to export farmyard slurries and manures doody et al 2020 to locations outside of the slms catchments to sites where there is demonstrable crop need may also be required paludiculture systems at inlets to ramsar sites could serve to reduce incoming loads the p being actively accumulated into plant crop biomass see section 4 6 however the sites would have to be managed and vegetation removed to export p offsite for use in energy generation or in building materials otherwise yet further recycling of p will prevail 4 3 altering water level management to mobilise and export phosphorus existing data suggests that raising water levels to restore peatlands leads to anoxia within the peat as it floods the chemically reducing conditions lead to solubilisation of manganese compounds and particularly iron species which in turn release soluble p bound to these redox sensitive substances into the porewater zak et al 2010 gelbrecht 2007 van diggelen et al 2014 and van de riet et al 2013 report p mobilization rates from rewetted fertilized peatlands of 10 50 kg p ha y the soluble p is then available for mobilisation and transport from the wetland system potentially spreading eutrophication on a wider scale the increase in available p could also be harnessed to grow a wet crop via paludiculture section 4 6 however there would likely be short term impacts on ecology which would have to be traded against longer term objectives table 3 4 4 nutrient removal in ditches via the of export of dredged sediment dredging of ditches on the slms occurs as part of a maintenance regime to keep the waterways open for the purposes of wet fences for cattle segregation and as part of the wider water level and flood risk management dredged material sediment plant material and water is placed on the bank within 5 m of the ditch the dredging stirs up the unconsolidated sediment and significantly increases the suspended solid concentrations in the water column schindler and comber 2021 following dredging tp levels significantly exceed the 0 1 mg p l level the disturbance is a temporary effect lasting around one week before returning to p concentrations typical of the ditch before the perturbation as already noted concentrations of p in dredged plant and sediment are high so if dredgings are exported this may contribute to reducing the legacy p problem in the slms excessively frequent ditch dredging however can have significant negative impacts on aquatic ecology leading to floating plant domination van zuidam and peeters 2013 so a balance must be struck between the rate of p export the need to mitigate against the harmful effects of eutrophication and the maintenance of hydroseral succession table 3 the costs of removing vegetation from site also have to be taken into account 4 5 export of nutrients by topsoil removal the data presented in figs 4 and 5 show higher concentrations of p in the upper peat layers making topsoil removal advantageous although problematic in terms of identifying an outlet for the topsoil once removed and the associated financial costs however topsoil removal can be used to create isolated rain fed scrapes with lower levels of n and p cabezas et al 2014 and has been undertaken in peatland restoration especially for former agricultural peatlands with high surface peat nutrient content where rewetting alone can risk excessive nutrient and methane emissions harpenslager et al 2015 zak et al 2017 based on limited data it has been successful in boreal and temperate regions for nutrient management and remediation emsens et al 2015 but there are obvious implications for ecosystem services table 3 4 6 biogeochemical restoration paludiculture and rewetting paludiculture is a cost appropriate management solution table 3 which has the potential to generate an alternative source of income for farmers and landowners whilst reducing summer concentrations of p and n in inflow water to wetland ramsar sites land et al 2016 geurts et al 2020 vroom et al 2022 in a review of 93 papers land et al 2016 found median removal rates of tn and tp of 93 and 1 2 g m2 yr respectively removal efficiencies are correlated with inlet concentrations loading rate retention time and annual average air temperature however given the practical difficulties of creating and managing integrated constructed wetlands on water feeds to the slms ramsar such as the lack of gradient and flow paludiculture may provide a more feasible option to remove p and reduce the damaging effects of excessive plant growth only one plant macronutrient needs to be growth rate limiting schindler et al 2008 in mineral soils and freshwater bodies that nutrient is normally p tallowin and jefferson 1999 zak et al 2010 however in static water bodies over peat with lower o2 concentrations and redox potential n may become plant growth rate limiting van duren and pegtel 2000 vroom et al 2022 under anaerobic conditions denitrification and loss of n is stimulated as facultative anaerobic bacteria use nitrate no3 instead of oxygen o2 as the terminal electron acceptor vroom et al 2022 analysis of summer n concentrations in peatland water bodies and ditches suggest that available n is rapidly assimilated during spring plant growth and therefore could limit p influenced eutrophication paludiculture has the potential to combine peat preservation carbon sequestration and the removal of legacy nutrients from water and peat bodies to control nutrient effluxes at the landscape scale whilst producing commercially viable plant biomass geurts et al 2020 zak mcinnes 2022 phragmites australis has been reported to contain between 2 and up to 10 g p kg 1 kobbing et al 2013 however lower p concentrations have been reported 1 g p kg where soil p concentrations were only up to 600 mg kg ge et al 2017 lower than observed in the samples on the slms typha is reported geurts et al 2020 to have the highest removal rates of p under high n availability however based on our 1 g p kg peat concentrations a 1 dry matter p content and a 10 t ha yr dry weight crop biomass as shown by our data it would take an estimated 100 typha harvests to remove legacy p 1 kg p m 2 from the peat body on the slms and several hundred harvests at the lower end growth rates report for phragmites and also typha geurts et al 2020 fig 6 shows a schematic representation of the effects of rewetting on p mobilization in the water column and peat body following rewetting the previously oxygenated surface layers of peat become anoxic the resulting redox conditions increase the mobility and bioavailability of p reducing in situ peat p concentrations schindler and comber 2021 the absence of o2 also results in the denitrification of mineralized n denitrification caused by rewetting combined with plant uptake can result in n becoming a plant growth limiting nutrient if n becomes limiting in the water body and inflow waters can be kept below 1 mg n l vroom et al 2022 this can neutralise the damaging effects of excessive plant growth from accumulated p given time n limitation will result in an increase in the diversity of emergent wetland plants irrespective of the availability of p removal of available p and n from the water column can be achieved by the placement of paludiculture crops in inflow waters along main drains to act as nutrient buffer zones walton et al 2020 where high nutrient waters drain from adjacent intensively managed agricultural land under rewetted anoxic conditions mobilised p could then be exported from the fen peat system to estuarine waters using a sustainable pump system overtime drawing down legacy p that has built up in the peat body over decades of inputs from nutrient rich inflows it is also possible that the mobilization of p could alter n cycling by stimulating organic n mineralization with resulting flux of ammonium and dissolved organic n zak et al 2010 in water bodies over peat with low conveyance or the absence of an n rich inflow a typha paludiculture crop is likely to become n growth rate limiting within 2 5 harvests vroom et al 2022 as there are several unknowns this strategy would need to be tested in experimental paludiculture field trials more research is required to adequately predict potential impacts from hydrological restoration and paludiculture crops sandin et al 2022 the diversity of emergent vegetation is likely to increase with n limitation and lower competition however at the water air interface oxygenation of surface layers may result in the excessive growth of floating lemna in unshaded water environments where rewetting has increased the mobilization of p peeters et al 2013 invasive floating aquatic plants such as azolla which is a problem species in the slms have n fixing capabilities and therefore may not be controlled by n limitation alone 5 conclusions the data presented in this paper clearly indicates p legacy and ongoing p pollution of the somerset levels ramsar site this can only be remediated via a combination of reducing the input concentrations to below the ditch quality standard currently 0 1 mg p l but this may need to be even lower and removing the legacy p pollution locked up in the peat and sediment an increasing body of evidence shows that although significant efforts are being employed by the relevant water company over the next 5 years to reduce loads of p to the slms this is unlikely to be sufficient for site restoration given inflow water pollution from agriculture and ongoing water level and flood risk management approaches a more sustainable vision for the slms would include naturally functioning wetland ecosystems with nutrient buffer zones lower internal water conveyance and a greater proportion of wetland habitats that are fen or wet woodland whilst in the short term this could have some negative implications for habitat diversity and specialist wet grassland species table 3 in the long term there would be significant benefits to ecosystem function paludiculture could help in the transition to higher summer wet levels and has the potential to reduce legacy p however experimental trials of paludiculture crops would be required to fully evaluate the

valverde et al 2015 woody e g apple citrus pears herbaceous e g strawberry watermelon and vine fruits e g grape kiwifruit are widely planted all over the world due to their great economic and

5 million tons respectively usda 2021 however growing water scarcity and poor agricultural management are the major threats to sustainable agricultural development because of competing demands from different sectors ghrab et al 2014 furthermore agriculture is considered as the main water consuming sector consuming approximately 70 of global water resources khapte et al 2019 besides woody herbaceous and vine fruits require relatively large amounts of water because of the long growing season and high evapotranspiration dai et al 2021 therefore to achieve water saving and stable fruits yield fruit production must apply precise water deficit management strategies and methods deficit irrigation di is a wide agricultural practice used to increase fruit yield while minimizing water consumption in orchards siakou et al 2021 also di has played an important role in alleviating water shortage and improving agricultural water use efficiency in orchards kang et al 2016 yang et al 2020 optimizing di strategies is crucial to ensure water saving and high yield fruit production and to maintain the sustainable development of the fruit industry many previous studies have been conducted

the high yield potential of the grapes buesa et al 2017 these results indicated that different fruit species groups optimized water management strategies are inconsistent additionally many individual studies are conducted at one or two sites but the available information on the effects of di on yield and wp of different fruit species groups has not been systematically analyzed and synthesized on a global scale therefore it is necessary to explore the optimized di strategy of different fruit species groups in order to improve the yield and wp of fruits meta analysis is a favorable statistical model that can be used to scientifically summarize the data from research studies du et al 2018 guo et al 2022 it can be employed to assess the consistency of separate studies involving the same

treatment is considered positive effect if lnr 0 negative effect if lnr 0 or no effect if lnr 0 due to the heterogeneity among studies i2 50 we used a random effect model to determine the impact of irrigation management climate conditions and soil properties on fruit yield and wp under di and fi cheng et al 2021a in order to facilitate understanding the relative percentage changes in comparison with fi were calculated as follows 7 e ln r 1 100 2 3 publication bias we applied egger regression to examine the possibility of publication bias egger et al 1997 and the trim and fill approach was used to test the impact of publication bias on overall effect size duval and tweedie 2015 according to the outcomes of egger regression there was no publication bias in the wp of woody and vine fruits furthermore the outcomes of the trim and fill method for wp of herbaceous fruit and the yield of woody vine and herbaceous fruits changed the magnitude but it did not change the significance therefore the publication bias was acceptable for this meta analysis 2 4 data analyses the meta analysis was conducted in the metafor package of r version 4 0 3 the frequency distribution of the effect sizes was plotted in originpro 8 5 other figures were plotted using the r ggplot2 package 3 results 3 1 overview of the dataset the effect size of the fruit yield and wp was found to follow normal distributions indicating that the datasets were homogeneous fig 2 fruit yield under di was significantly less than under fi practice p 0 05 and woody herbaceous and vine fruits yield were decreased by 13 74 95 ci 16 51 to 10 87 20 51 95 ci 16 56 to 24 63 and 9 03 95 ci 5 26 to 12 64 fig 3a however di significantly increased woody and vine fruits wp by 13 34 95 ci 6 61 20 5 and 9 89 95 ci 5 63 14 32 fig 3b p 0 05 the overall effect size of herbaceous fruits wp was 2 08 95 ci 5 88 to 1 87 and was not significant p 0 05 fig 3b the results demonstrated that herbaceous fruits were more vulnerable to yield reduction than woody and vine fruits under di and the potential of water saving was poor 3 2 yield and wp response of irrigation management to different fruit species groups 3 2 1 woody fruit as the water deficit degree increased the woody fruit yield showed a decreasing trend and the wp showed a firstly reducing and then increasing trend fig 4 a and 4b the effect size of woody fruits yield under low water deficit was 0 87 which was significantly different from that of other deficits p 0 05 mild moderate and severe water deficits significantly reduced woody fruits yield by 9 99 16 75 and 18 87 respectively while low mild moderate and severe water deficits increased woody fruits wp by 9 77 7 35 15 90 and 24 57 respectively and low and moderate water deficit had significant effects on woody fruits wp p 0 05 therefore woody fruits are suitable for low deficit irrigation which can save water and increase yield as for the water deficit timing di in stage i significantly reduced woody fruit yield by 8 67 but increased wp by 1 86 p 0 05 the di in stage ii had the smallest reduction in woody fruit yield 4 97 and significantly increased the woody fruits wp by 9 28 p 0 05 di in stage iii and stage iv significantly reduced woody fruit yield and wp by 14 32 and 6 23 38 47 and 33 59 respectively p 0 05 in addition di in the whole growth period significantly improved woody fruits wp to 26 06 p 0 05 but it greatly reduced woody fruit yield by 14 02 therefore woody fruits are suitable for di in stage i or stage ii while in stage iii woody fruits are very sensitive to water deficit and do not adapt to di the irrigation methods reduced the woody fruit yield by 2 67 16 67 under di except surge root irrigation and increased the wp by 8 46 45 13 surface drip furrow hole and sprinkler irrigation under di significantly reduced woody fruits yield by 15 75 15 03 16 67 and 5 85 p 0 05 respectively however surface drip subsurface drip furrow and sprinkler irrigation under di significantly increased woody fruits wp by 10 45 8 46 45 13 and 43 91 p 0 05 respectively in addition surge root irrigation for woody fruits increased yield and wp by 1 81 and 11 89 respectively therefore considering the yield and wp comprehensively surge root irrigation performed best for woody fruits 3 2 2 herbaceous fruit as the water deficit degree increased both the herbaceous fruits yield and wp showed a decreasing trend fig 4c and d moderate and severe water deficits significantly reduced herbaceous fruit yield and wp by 21 94 and 1 05 32 81 and 11 57 respectively p 0 05 the mild water deficit reduced herbaceous fruit yield by 12 44 but increased wp by 2 25 therefore an appropriate water deficit mild degree for herbaceous fruits can reduce the risk of yield reduction and improve wp in terms of the deficit timing both herbaceous fruit yield and wp showed first decreasing but then increasing trend as the deficit stage delayed di in stage i stage ii and stage iii reduced both herbaceous fruits yield and wp by 13 35 and 1 51 24 08 and 11 76 15 25 and 2 74 respectively and only di in stage ii had significant adverse effects on herbaceous fruits wp di in the whole growth period and stage iv reduced herbaceous fruit yield by 23 66 and 13 18 but increased the wp by 0 37 and 0 37 the results showed that herbaceous fruits are suitable for di in stage iv which can decline the risk of yield reduction and improve wp the surface drip and subsurface drip irrigation under di significantly reduced herbaceous fruit yield and wp by 21 23 and 1 61 27 87 and 33 72 respectively p 0 05 the furrow irrigation under di reduced herbaceous fruit yield by only 0 66 but increased the wp by 2 29 therefore considering the yield and wp comprehensively furrow irrigation performed best for herbaceous fruits 3 2 3 vine fruit as the water deficit degree increased the vine fruits yield showed a decreasing trend while the wp showed an increasing first and then decreasing trend figs 4e and 4 f low mild moderate and severe water deficits reduced vine fruit yield by 2 25 7 54 8 05 and 14 72 respectively and only low water deficit had no significant negative effects on vine fruit yield however mild and moderate water deficit significantly increased vine fruits wp by 10 37 and 13 87 p 0 05 hence moderate water deficits were suitable irrigation strategies for vine fruits which could save water and stabilize production di in the whole growth period stage ii stage iii and stage iv reduced vine fruits yield by 12 48 3 55 19 34 and 5 03 respectively and di in the whole growth period and stage iii had significant negative effects on vine fruits yield however di in stage i increased vine fruits yield by 5 38 compared with fi di in stage i obtained the largest effect size in vine fruits wp by 22 13 while di in stage iii obtained the smallest effect size in vine fruits wp by 4 95 therefore vine fruits are suitable for di in stage i which can inhibit excessive nutritional growth while di in stage iii inhibits the expansion of fruit cells and has a great negative impact on fruit development both surface drip and subsurface drip irrigation significantly decreased vine fruit yield by 8 1 and 21 38 p 0 05 respectively nevertheless surface drip irrigation significantly increased vine fruits wp by 9 89 3 3 yield and wp response of climate conditions to different fruit species groups 3 3 1 woody fruit seasonal precipitation sp and annual average temperature aat significantly affected woody fruit yield and wp under di fig 5a and b the woody fruit yield showed decreasing trend as sp decreased when sp was 200 400 mm and 200 mm the woody fruits yield and wp were reduced by 22 22 and 0 74 26 43 and 18 07 respectively when sp was 400 mm woody fruit yield was reduced by 9 76 while wp significantly increased by 13 1 p 0 05 both woody fruit yield and wp showed a decreasing trend as the aat decreased the reduction in woody fruit yield was 10 93 when the aat was 10 c which was higher than that in regions with an aat 10 c 33 76 di for woody fruits obtained the largest effect size in wp 13 23 when the aat was 10 c while di obtained the smallest effect size in wp 23 7 when the aat was 10 c the results demonstrated that di for woody fruits was suitable for application in the regions with large sp 400 mm and aat 10 c 3 3 2 herbaceous fruit sp and aat had a significant effect on herbaceous fruit yield and wp under di figs 5c and 5d when sp was 400 mm 200 400 mm and 200 mm the reduction in herbaceous fruit yield was 22 31 29 14 and 3 35 respectively herbaceous fruits yield in regions with sp 200 mm was significantly different from when sp 400 mm and 200 400 mm when sp was 400 mm 200 400 mm and 200 mm herbaceous fruits wp was increased by 7 94 1 88 and 13 1 respectively the herbaceous fruit yield showed an increased trend as the aat decreased while the opposite trend was observed for wp when the aat was 10 c and 10 c both herbaceous fruits yield and wp were reduced by 22 65 and 14 28 23 12 and 2 77 respectively the results demonstrated that di for herbaceous fruits was suitable for application in the regions with sp 200 mm and aat 10 c 3 3 3 vine fruit sp and aat significantly affected vine fruits yield and wp under di figs 5e and 5f when the sp was 400 mm and 200 mm vine fruits yield was significantly reduced by 11 63 and 8 41 while wp was significantly increased by 6 29 and 15 98 respectively p 0 05 the effect size of vine fruit yield and wp were 4 63 and 12 5 when the aat was 10 c which were higher than those when the aat was 10 c 12 56 and 7 35 respectively the results demonstrated that di for vine fruits was suitable for application in the regions with sp 200 mm and aat 10 c 3 4 yield and wp response of soil properties to different fruit species groups 3 4 1 woody fruit soil texture st and ph under di had a significant negative effect on woody fruit yield while the wp was significantly increased by soil bulk density sbd and ph under di fig 6a and b the woody fruit yield was highest in sandy soil 8 41 which was higher than those in loam and clay soil 9 74 and 27 16 respectively di in sandy soil reduced woody fruits wp by 0 82 while di in clay and loam soil increased wp by 6 47 and 21 44 respectively woody fruits yield and wp were highest in soil with sbd 1 35 g cm 3 14 93 and 0 49 respectively which were higher than those in soil with sbd 1 35 g cm 3 di in acidic soils increased the woody fruits yield and wp by 0 33 and 17 07 which were higher than those in alkaline soils ph 7 12 61 and 16 38 respectively therefore it is evident that di for woody fruits performed better in loam soils with high sbd 1 35 g cm 3 3 4 2 herbaceous fruit the st sbd and ph under di significantly affected herbaceous fruits yield and wp fig 6c and d the herbaceous fruits yield and wp were highest in loam soil 16 46 and 0 47 which were higher than those in clay soil 19 17 and 6 67 as sbd increased the herbaceous fruit yield increased while the opposite trend was showed for wp when sbd 1 35 g cm 3 and 1 35 g cm 3 the herbaceous fruit yield was reduced by 16 73 and 15 9 and the wp was increased by 4 35 and 5 23 respectively di in acidic soils ph 7 increased the herbaceous fruit yield by 33 12 while di in alkaline soils ph 7 reduced the herbaceous fruit yield and wp by 29 and 12 9 therefore it is evident that di for herbaceous fruits was suitable for application in loam soils with low sbd 1 35 g cm 3 3 4 3 vine fruit vine fruit yield was reduced by st and ph under di while the opposite trend was observed for wp fig 6e and f di in loam and sandy soil reduced vine fruits yield by 9 1 and 2 75 respectively while di in loam soil increased the wp by 11 09 di in soils with sbd 1 35 g cm 3 reduced vine fruits yield by 8 30 but increased the wp by 11 09 3 5 best zone for application of deficit irrigation to different fruit species groups in order to understand the application strategy of di in different fruit species groups the effect size points corresponding to the yield and wp were distributed in five zones fig 7 zone a had a positive effect on fruit yield and wp while an opposite trend was displayed in zone f in zone e wp increased and fruit yield decreased however zone g showed the opposite trend in terms of zone b zone c and zone d the points distributed in the three zones represented that the effect size of fruit yield was between the overall effect size and zero and the effect size of wp was greater than zero therefore zones a b a c and a d were the target zones of the vine woody and herbaceous fruits that could save water and maintain yield respectively the proportion of woody fruits was the largest 60 87 in target zones a c followed by vine fruits in target zones a b 56 25 and herbaceous fruits obtained the smallest percentage 29 51 in target zones a d the effect of irrigation management climate conditions and soil properties on the distribution of the points for different fruit species groups in different zones is shown in table1 the point distribution of different fruit species groups varied greatly in the five zones in terms of woody fruits the proportion of sprinkler irrigation was the largest 100 in target zones a c followed by surge root irrigation 95 24 and furrow irrigation obtained the smallest percentage 42 86 the proportions at the whole growth period stage i stage ii stage iii and stage iv were 58 14 76 47 66 67 58 33 and 50 00 in target zones a c respectively the percentage of low degree 94 12 was higher than that of mild 71 11 moderate 46 55 and severe degree water deficit 50 in target zones a c the result showed that low deficit irrigation at stage i tend to save water and increase yield the percentage of sp 400 mm 200 400 mm and 200 mm was 69 14 27 78 and 27 78 respectively the percentage of sbd 1 35 g cm 3 was greater than that of sbd 1 35 g cm 3 67 09 and 22 22 respectively the percentage of 10 c and 10 c was 68 68 and 26 31 respectively the proportion of ph 7 was higher than that of ph 7 65 31 and 50 respectively the largest proportion occurred in loam soil 71 85 and effect sizes of sandy and clay soil accounted for 50 and 26 67 in target zones a c overall low degree 80 100 irrigation amount of fi di performed better at stage i or ii under sprinkler irrigation or surge root irrigation in loam soil with high sbd 1 35 g cm 3 and ph ph 7 in regions with sp 400 mm and aat 10 c in terms of herbaceous fruits there was a greater proportion of furrow irrigation 66 67 compared to surface drip irrigation 26 42 and subsurface drip irrigation 0 in target zones a d the proportion was lower in stage ii 10 00 but greater in stage i 30 00 whole growth period 31 03 stage

the largest proportion in target zones a d was found in sp 200 mm 75 00 followed by 200 400 mm 20 00 and 400 mm 13 89 the percentage of 10 c was 36 36 which was 15 9 higher than that of 10 c the proportion was higher in lower sbd 1 35 g cm 3 than that of soils with 1 35 g cm 3 40 00 and 26 31 respectively the smallest proportion in target zones a d occurred in clay soil 22 22 while the largest proportion was found in loam soil 30 00 overall mild degree 60 80 irrigation amount of fi di performed better at stage iv under furrow irrigation in loam soils with low sbd 1 35 g cm 3 in

under surface drip irrigation in regions with sp 200 mm and aat 10 c 4 discussion 4 1 yield and wp of different fruit species groups different fruit species groups responded differently to water deficits cheng et al 2021c kang et al 2021 di reduced the yield of woody herbaceous and vine fruits by 13 74 20 51 and 9 03 and increased wp by 13 34 2 08 and 9 89 compared with full irrigation fi respectively previous studies found similar results demonstrating that di decreased woody and vine fruits yield cui et al 2008 and significantly increased the wp romero et al 2016 garcía tejero et al 2010 concluded that as compared to fi di reduced citrus yield by 10 12 but significantly increased wp by 24 herbaceous fruits were more vulnerable to yield reduction than woody and vine fruits under di the possible reason is the cell wall of herbaceous fruits are more likely to lose elasticity and cannot expand due to water stress leading to a decline in yield cui et al 2009 4 2 irrigation management effect on yield and wp the previous field experiments have demonstrated that fruits have different sensitivity and certain adaptability to water deficits appropriate water stress could transfer more photosynthetic products from vegetative organs to reproductive organs which is conducive to fruit growth and development riccardo et al 2019 low degree 80 100 irrigation amount of fi di performed better which can increase woody fruits yield and wp by 0 87 and 9 77 results similar to those reported by qiang et al 2015 who found that a low water deficit could promote fruit growth and yield 22 1 of jujube and improve the wp by 41 17 with respect to fi mild degree 60 80 irrigation amount of fi di declined the risk of herbaceous fruits yield reduction and significantly increased wp by 2 25 by adjusting osmotic pressure changing leaf structure and improving photosynthetic capabilities a mild water deficit may enhance photosynthesis moderate degree 40 60 irrigation amount of fi di performed better which can increase vine yield and wp by 8 05 and 13 87 the result is similar to those reported by cui et al 2009 who concluded that moderate water deficits partially inhibit the growth of vegetative organs but do not significantly reduce fruit yield when di is applied to fruit trees at a certain period the root growth can be regulated to prevent excessive root stem leaf and other component growth di can maintain each component grows optimally ensure root shoot ratios are balanced and improve economic yield and wp kang et al 2021 di is suitable for woody fruits in stage i or stage ii reducing the risk of yield reduction and increasing wp by 1 86 9 28 besides vine fruits are suitable for di in stage i which can increase yield and wp by 5 38 and 22 13 there were also similar results demonstrated by riccardo et al 2019 the appropriate water deficits during stages i and ii can suppress the growth of vegetative organs promote the accumulation of organic matter in reproductive organs rather than vegetative ones and enhance fruit growth di at stage iv performed better which can decline the risk of herbaceous fruit yield reduction and improve wp by 0 37 the result is similar to those reported by zhang et al 2018 who concluded that di at stage iv could maintain fruit yield and increase wp which was a suitable water deficit strategy for citrus surge root irrigation for woody fruits increased yield and wp by 1 81 and 11 89 respectively similar results were reported by wu et al 2010 who revealed that compared with the tube or drip irrigation surge root irrigation improved the yield and wp of jujube trees the most this may be because water is directly transported to the roots of the fruit trees using surge root irrigation reducing evaporation and wind resistance dai et al 2019 among irrigation methods furrow irrigation under di performed better for herbaceous fruits which can increase yield and wp by 0 66 and 2 29 the result is similar to those reported by graterol et al 1993 who concluded that furrow irrigation reduces water application without affecting soybean yield and thereby leads to more efficient water use 4 3 climate conditions and soil properties affect yield and wp precipitation and temperature are the main factors affecting fruit tree yield and wp yu et al 2020 di for woody fruits performed better in regions with sp 400 mm and aat 10 c which can decline the risk of yield reduction and increase wp by 13 1 13 23 the reason for this may be that higher precipitation and temperature could meet the growing need for woody fruits and promote photosynthesis cui et al 2009 on the other hand di performed better for herbaceous and vine fruits in regions with sp 200 mm and aat 10 c which can decline the risk of yield reduction and increase wp the reason for this may be that lower precipitation and temperature caused a decline in fruit evapotranspiration zheng et al 2019 di for woody herbaceous and vine fruits performed better in loam soils these results were in accordance with the findings of saitta et al 2021 who concluded that water savings of up to 53 were reached for the citrus grove in sandy loam soil under deficit irrigation di this may be because loam soil is conducive to root growth and maintain strong root activity and has good water retention property cheng et al 2021c however our study research is limited by the availability and feasibility of data our data collection standards mainly focus on the impact of di at different stages or the whole stage on yield and wp and largely ignore the effects of long term di on fruit yield and wp due to the insufficient data in vine fruits we were unable to evaluate the effects of soil ph on the response of yield and wp therefore future studies could be conducted after collecting more data moreover this meta analysis identify the optimal irrigation management strategy for woody herbaceous and vine fruits considering yield and wp however quality is also an important indicator to consider in irrigation decisions for fruits thus quality indicator needs to be analyzed to explore the optimal irrigation management strategy in the future 5 conclusions this study analyzed the effects of di on yield and wp of woody herbaceous and vine fruits under different irrigation management climate condition and soil properties di reduced the yield of woody herbaceous and vine fruits by 13 74 20 51 and 9 03 and increased wp by 13 34 2 08 and 9 89 herbaceous fruits were more vulnerable to yield reduction than woody and vine fruits under di low degree di 80 100 fi at stage i or ii under sprinkler irrigation or surge root irrigation performed better for woody fruits while mild degree di 60 80 fi at stage iv under furrow irrigation was optimal for herbaceous fruits and moderate degree di 40 60 fi at stage i was best for vine fruits for woody fruits di is suitable for higher seasonal precipitation sp 400 mm and annual average temperature aat 10 c in contrast for vine fruits and herbaceous fruits di is suitable for lower sp 200 mm and aat 10 c our study has determined the optimal irrigation management strategies for woody herbaceous and vine fruits considering yield and wp indicators furthermore in future research we need to consider quality indicators in irrigation decisions our results demonstrated that it is critical for different fruit species groups to choose the optimal irrigation management strategy declaration of competing interest the authors declared that they have no conflicts of interest to this

8852,deficit irrigation di is widely recognized as an irrigation method to save water and increase maintain yield the objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of di on yield and water productivity wp the ratio of yield divided by evapotranspiration et of woody fruits apple citrus pear peach herbaceous fruits strawberry watermelon and vine fruit grape and to identify the optimal irrigation management strategy for different fruit species groups for this we conducted a comprehensive meta analysis with 591 observations from 56 peer reviewed papers results showed that di reduced the yield of woody herbaceous and vine fruits by 13 74 20 51 and 9 03 and increased wp by 13 34 2 08 and 9 89 compared with full irrigation fi respectively herbaceous fruits were more vulnerable to yield reduction than woody and vine fruits under di as for woody fruits compared with fi low degree 80 100 irrigation amount of fi di performed better increasing yield and wp by 0 87 and 9 77 woody fruits are suitable for di in stage i and stage ii bud burst to leafing stage and flowering to fruit set stage which can reduce the risk of yield reduction and significantly increase wp by 1 86 9 28 among irrigation methods surge root irrigation and sprinkler irrigation under di performed better for woody fruits increasing yield and wp by 1 81 and 11 89 5 85 and 43 91 respectively in terms of herbaceous fruits compared with fi mild degree 60 80 fi di declined the risk of yield reduction and significantly increased wp by 2 25 di at stage iv fruit maturation stage performed better which can decrease the risk of herbaceous fruit yield reduction and improve wp by 0 37 among irrigation methods furrow irrigation under di performed better for herbaceous fruits increasing yield and wp by 0 66 and 2 29 in terms of vine fruits compared with fi moderate degree 40 60 fi di performed better which can significantly increase yield and wp by 8 05 and 13 87 vine fruits are suitable for di in stage

herbaceous fruits di is suitable for lower sp 200 mm and aat 10 c our findings provide guidance for precise water deficit management of woody herbaceous and vine fruits keywords deficit irrigation yield water productivity woody fruits herbaceous fruits vine fruits data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction the rapid development of fruit production has been driven by the increasing demand for nutrition and health wei et al 2016 fruits can be divided into herbaceous vine and woody fruits based on plant characteristics cheng et al 2017 silvia et al 2022 valverde et al 2015 woody e g apple citrus pears herbaceous e g strawberry watermelon and vine fruits e g grape kiwifruit are widely planted all over the world due to their great economic and ecological benefits global apples pears and grapes production in 2021 were estimated to increase by 1 million 0 9 million and 1 million tons compared to 2020 attaining 81 6 million 23 5 million and 25 5 million tons respectively usda 2021 however growing water scarcity and poor agricultural management are the major threats to sustainable agricultural development because of competing demands from different sectors ghrab et al 2014 furthermore agriculture is considered as the main water consuming sector consuming approximately 70 of global water resources khapte et al 2019 besides woody herbaceous and vine fruits require relatively large amounts of water because of the long growing season and high evapotranspiration dai et al 2021 therefore to achieve water saving and stable fruits yield fruit production must apply precise water deficit management strategies and methods deficit irrigation di is a wide agricultural practice used to increase fruit yield while minimizing water consumption in orchards siakou et al 2021 also di has played an important role in alleviating water shortage and improving agricultural water use efficiency in orchards kang et al 2016 yang et al 2020 optimizing di strategies is crucial to ensure water saving and high yield fruit production and to maintain the sustainable development of the fruit industry many previous studies have been conducted on the effects of di on yield and wp of woody gonzalez dugo et al 2018 panigrahi and srivastava 2016 zhou et al 2017 herbaceous ariza et al 2021 proietti et al 2010 sarda et al 2021 and vine fruits li

the high yield potential of the grapes buesa et al 2017 these results indicated that different fruit species groups optimized water management strategies are inconsistent additionally many individual studies are conducted at one or two sites but the available information on the effects of di on yield and wp of different fruit species groups has not been systematically analyzed and synthesized on a global scale therefore it is necessary to explore the optimized di strategy of different fruit species groups in order to improve the yield and wp of fruits meta analysis is a favorable statistical model that can be used to scientifically summarize the data from research studies du et al 2018 guo et al 2022 it can be employed to assess the consistency of separate studies involving the same research purposes cheng et al 2021b singh et al 2005 subsurface drip irrigation was analyzed globally to assess its effects on crop yield and wp for crops vegetables and fruits wang et al 2022 to evaluate the interactive effects of water and n inputs on yield water use efficiency and n use efficiency of citrus orchards a global meta analysis was conducted qin et al 2016 therefore a systematic and quantitative analysis is critical to enhancing the understanding of the effect of di on yield and wp of different fruit species groups under different conditions in this study a meta analysis based on 591 observations of yield and wp from 56 peer reviewed published studies was conducted to 1 comprehensively evaluate the effects of di on yield and wp of woody herbaceous and vine fruits 2 explore the appropriate climate conditions and soil properties that result in the highest yield and wp for woody herbaceous and vine fruits under di 3 identify the optimal irrigation management strategy for woody herbaceous and vine fruits 2 materials and methods 2 1 data collection this study collected data on the yield and wp of different fruit species groups under di from peer reviewed

replicates per treatment d the mean sample size and standard deviations or standard errors of fruit yield and wp could be directly extracted or calculated from the numerical or graphical data using getdata graph digitizer 2 26 when the standard error se was given the standard deviation sd was calculated by sd se n otherwise sd was calculated by multiplying the mean by 0 1 based on the criteria a total of 56 publications with 591 observations were included in this study and experimental sites of the dataset were mainly distributed in 17 countries a world map showing the sampling sites of global woody herbaceous and vine fruit in this meta analysis has been shown in fig 1 several subgroups including irrigation management climate conditions and soil properties that could affect yield and wp of different fruit species groups under di were classified and recorded by these criteria a irrigation management included irrigation method surface drip irrigation sdi subsurface drip

subgroup and marked with an 2 2 statistical analysis the natural log response ratio lnr was used to represent the effects of di on the yield and wp of different fruit species groups hedges gurevitch jessica 1999 1 ln r ln x t ln x c where x t and x c represent the yield and wp under di and full irrigation respectively in addition the variance of v was calculated as luo et al 2006 2 v sd t 2 n t x t 2 sd c 2 n c x c 2 where sd t and sd c were the standard deviations of di and fi respectively and nt and nc was the sample sizes for di and fi respectively usually the weighted effect sizes lnr were used to produce the greatest precision since the statistical precision of each study is different the weighted effect sizes were calculated as curtis and wang 1998 3 ln rr w i ln r i w i where w i is the weighted factor of effect size ln ri calculated as 4 w 1 v to identify significant differences in the effect sizes the 95 confidence interval of the lnr 95 ci was calculated by the following equations 5 l n r 95 ci ln r 1 96 s l n r 6 s ln r 1 w i when the lnr 95 ci did not overlap with zero differences between di and full irrigation were considered significant p 0 05 a deficit irrigation treatment is considered positive effect if lnr 0 negative effect if lnr 0 or no effect if lnr 0 due to the heterogeneity among studies i2 50 we used a random effect model to determine the impact of irrigation management climate conditions and soil properties on fruit yield and wp under di and fi cheng et al 2021a in order to facilitate understanding the relative percentage changes in comparison with fi were calculated as follows 7 e ln r 1 100 2 3 publication bias we applied egger regression to examine the possibility of publication bias egger et al 1997 and the trim and fill approach was used to test the impact of publication bias on overall effect size duval and tweedie 2015 according to the outcomes of egger regression there was no publication bias in the wp of woody and vine fruits furthermore the outcomes of the trim and fill method for wp of herbaceous fruit and the yield of woody vine and herbaceous fruits changed the magnitude but it did not change the significance therefore the publication bias was acceptable for this meta analysis 2 4 data analyses the meta analysis was conducted in the metafor package of r version 4 0 3 the frequency distribution of the effect sizes was plotted in originpro 8 5 other figures were plotted using the r ggplot2 package 3 results 3 1 overview of the dataset the effect size of the fruit yield and wp was found to follow normal distributions indicating that the datasets were homogeneous fig 2 fruit yield under di was significantly less than under fi practice p 0 05 and woody herbaceous and vine fruits yield were decreased by 13 74 95 ci 16 51 to 10 87 20 51 95 ci 16 56 to 24 63 and 9 03 95 ci 5 26 to 12 64 fig 3a however di significantly increased woody and vine fruits wp by 13 34 95 ci 6 61 20 5 and 9 89 95 ci 5 63 14 32 fig 3b p 0 05 the overall effect size of herbaceous fruits wp was 2 08 95 ci 5 88 to 1 87 and was not significant p 0 05 fig 3b the results demonstrated that herbaceous fruits were more vulnerable to yield reduction than woody and vine fruits under di and the potential of water saving was poor 3 2 yield and wp response of irrigation management to different fruit species groups 3 2 1 woody fruit as the water deficit degree increased the woody fruit yield showed a decreasing trend and the wp showed a firstly reducing and then increasing trend fig 4 a and 4b the effect size of woody fruits yield under low water deficit was 0 87 which was significantly different from that of other deficits p 0 05 mild moderate and severe water deficits significantly reduced woody fruits yield by 9 99 16 75 and 18 87 respectively while low mild moderate and severe water deficits increased woody fruits wp by 9 77 7 35 15 90 and 24 57 respectively and low and moderate water deficit had significant effects on woody fruits wp p 0 05 therefore woody fruits are suitable for low deficit irrigation which can save water and increase yield as for the water deficit timing di in stage i significantly reduced woody fruit yield by 8 67 but increased wp by 1 86 p 0 05 the di in stage ii had the smallest reduction in woody fruit yield 4 97 and significantly increased the woody fruits wp by 9 28 p 0 05 di in stage iii and stage iv significantly reduced woody fruit yield and wp by 14 32 and 6 23 38 47 and 33 59 respectively p 0 05 in addition di in the whole growth period significantly improved woody fruits wp to 26 06 p 0 05 but it greatly reduced woody fruit yield by 14 02 therefore woody fruits are suitable for di in stage i or stage ii while in stage iii woody fruits are very sensitive to water deficit and do not adapt to di the irrigation methods reduced the woody fruit yield by 2 67 16 67 under di except surge root irrigation and increased the wp by 8 46 45 13 surface drip furrow hole and sprinkler irrigation under di significantly reduced woody fruits yield by 15 75 15 03 16 67 and 5 85 p 0 05 respectively however surface drip subsurface drip furrow and sprinkler irrigation under di significantly increased woody fruits wp by 10 45 8 46 45 13 and 43 91 p 0 05 respectively in addition surge root irrigation for woody fruits increased yield and wp by 1 81 and 11 89 respectively therefore considering the yield and wp comprehensively surge root irrigation performed best for woody fruits 3 2 2 herbaceous fruit as the water deficit degree increased both the herbaceous fruits yield and wp showed a decreasing trend fig 4c and d moderate and severe water deficits significantly reduced herbaceous fruit yield and wp by 21 94 and 1 05 32 81 and 11 57 respectively p 0 05 the mild water deficit reduced herbaceous fruit yield by 12 44 but increased wp by 2 25 therefore an appropriate water deficit mild degree for herbaceous fruits can reduce the risk of yield reduction and improve wp in terms of the deficit timing both herbaceous fruit yield and wp showed first decreasing but then increasing trend as the deficit stage delayed di in stage i stage ii and stage iii reduced both herbaceous fruits yield and wp by 13 35 and 1 51 24 08 and 11 76 15 25 and 2 74 respectively and only di in stage ii had significant adverse effects on herbaceous fruits wp di in the whole growth period and stage iv reduced herbaceous fruit yield by 23 66 and 13 18 but increased the wp by 0 37 and 0 37 the results showed that herbaceous fruits are suitable for di in stage iv which can decline the risk of yield reduction and improve wp the surface drip and subsurface drip irrigation under di significantly reduced herbaceous fruit yield and wp by 21 23 and 1 61 27 87 and 33 72 respectively p 0 05 the furrow irrigation under di reduced herbaceous fruit yield by only 0 66 but increased the wp by 2 29 therefore considering the yield and wp comprehensively furrow irrigation performed best for herbaceous fruits 3 2 3 vine fruit as the water deficit degree increased the vine fruits yield showed a decreasing trend while the wp showed an increasing first and then decreasing trend figs 4e and 4 f low mild moderate and severe water deficits reduced vine fruit yield by 2 25 7 54 8 05 and 14 72 respectively and only low water deficit had no significant negative effects on vine fruit yield however mild and moderate water deficit significantly increased vine fruits wp by 10 37 and 13 87 p 0 05 hence moderate water deficits were suitable irrigation strategies for vine fruits which could save water and stabilize production di in the whole growth period stage ii stage iii and stage iv reduced vine fruits yield by 12 48 3 55 19 34 and 5 03 respectively and di in the whole growth period and stage iii had significant negative effects on vine fruits yield however di in stage i increased vine fruits yield by 5 38 compared with fi di in stage i obtained the largest effect size in vine fruits wp by 22 13 while di in stage iii obtained the smallest effect size in vine fruits wp by 4 95 therefore vine fruits are suitable for di in stage i which can inhibit excessive nutritional growth while di in stage iii inhibits the expansion of fruit cells and has a great negative impact on fruit development both surface drip and subsurface drip irrigation significantly decreased vine fruit yield by 8 1 and 21 38 p 0 05 respectively nevertheless surface drip irrigation significantly increased vine fruits wp by 9 89 3 3 yield and wp response of climate conditions to different fruit species groups 3 3 1 woody fruit seasonal precipitation sp and annual average temperature aat significantly affected woody fruit yield and wp under di fig 5a and b the woody fruit yield showed decreasing trend as sp decreased when sp was 200 400 mm and 200 mm the woody fruits yield and wp were reduced by 22 22 and 0 74 26 43 and 18 07 respectively when sp was 400 mm woody fruit yield was reduced by 9 76 while wp significantly increased by 13 1 p 0 05 both woody fruit yield and wp showed a decreasing trend as the aat decreased the reduction in woody fruit yield was 10 93 when the aat was 10 c which was higher than that in regions with an aat 10 c 33 76 di for woody fruits obtained the largest effect size in wp 13 23 when the aat was 10 c while di obtained the smallest effect size in wp 23 7 when the aat was 10 c the results demonstrated that di for woody fruits was suitable for application in the regions with large sp 400 mm and aat 10 c 3 3 2 herbaceous fruit sp and aat had a significant effect on herbaceous fruit yield and wp under di figs 5c and 5d when sp was 400 mm 200 400 mm and 200 mm the reduction in herbaceous fruit yield was 22 31 29 14 and 3 35 respectively herbaceous fruits yield in regions with sp 200 mm was significantly different from when sp 400 mm and 200 400 mm when sp was 400 mm 200 400 mm and 200 mm herbaceous fruits wp was increased by 7 94 1 88 and 13 1 respectively the herbaceous fruit yield showed an increased trend as the aat decreased while the opposite trend was observed for wp when the aat was 10 c and 10 c both herbaceous fruits yield and wp were reduced by 22 65 and 14 28 23 12 and 2 77 respectively the results demonstrated that di for herbaceous fruits was suitable for application in the regions with sp 200 mm and aat 10 c 3 3 3 vine fruit sp and aat significantly affected vine fruits yield and wp under di figs 5e and 5f when the sp was 400 mm and 200 mm vine fruits yield was significantly reduced by 11 63 and 8 41 while wp was significantly increased by 6 29 and 15 98 respectively p 0 05 the effect size of vine fruit yield and wp were 4 63 and 12 5 when the aat was 10 c which were higher than those when the aat was 10 c 12 56 and 7 35 respectively the results demonstrated that di for vine fruits was suitable for application in the regions with sp 200 mm and aat 10 c 3 4 yield and wp response of soil properties to different fruit species groups 3 4 1 woody fruit soil texture st and ph under di had a significant negative effect on woody fruit yield while the wp was significantly increased by soil bulk density sbd and ph under di fig 6a and b the woody fruit yield was highest in sandy soil 8 41 which was higher than those in loam and clay soil 9 74 and 27 16 respectively di in sandy soil reduced woody fruits wp by 0 82 while di in clay and loam soil increased wp by 6 47 and 21 44 respectively woody fruits yield and wp were highest in soil with sbd 1 35 g cm 3 14 93 and 0 49 respectively which were higher than those in soil with sbd 1 35 g cm 3 di in acidic soils increased the woody fruits yield and wp by 0 33 and 17 07 which were higher than those in alkaline soils ph 7 12 61 and 16 38 respectively therefore it is evident that di for woody fruits performed better in loam soils with high sbd 1 35 g cm 3 3 4 2 herbaceous fruit the st sbd and ph under di significantly affected herbaceous fruits yield and wp fig 6c and d the herbaceous fruits yield and wp were highest in loam soil 16 46 and 0 47 which were higher than those in clay soil 19 17 and 6 67 as sbd increased the herbaceous fruit yield increased while the opposite trend was showed for wp when sbd 1 35 g cm 3 and 1 35 g cm 3 the herbaceous fruit yield was reduced by 16 73 and 15 9 and the wp was increased by 4 35 and 5 23 respectively di in acidic soils ph 7 increased the herbaceous fruit yield by 33 12 while di in alkaline soils ph 7 reduced the herbaceous fruit yield and wp by 29 and 12 9 therefore it is evident that di for herbaceous fruits was suitable for application in loam soils with low sbd 1 35 g cm 3 3 4 3 vine fruit vine fruit yield was reduced by st and ph under di while the opposite trend was observed for wp fig 6e and f di in loam and sandy soil reduced vine fruits yield by 9 1 and 2 75 respectively while di in loam soil increased the wp by 11 09 di in soils with sbd 1 35 g cm 3 reduced vine fruits yield by 8 30 but increased the wp by 11 09 3 5 best zone for application of deficit irrigation to different fruit species groups in order to understand the application strategy of di in different fruit species groups the effect size points corresponding to the yield and wp were distributed in five zones fig 7 zone a had a positive effect on fruit yield and wp while an opposite trend was displayed in zone f in zone e wp increased and fruit yield decreased however zone g showed the opposite trend in terms of zone b zone c and zone d the points distributed in the three zones represented that the effect size of fruit yield was between the overall effect size and zero and the effect size of wp was greater than zero therefore zones a b a c and a d were the target zones of the vine woody and herbaceous fruits that could save water and maintain yield respectively the proportion of woody fruits was the largest 60 87 in target zones a c followed by vine fruits in target zones a b 56 25 and herbaceous fruits obtained the smallest percentage 29 51 in target zones a d the effect of irrigation management climate conditions and soil properties on the distribution of the points for different fruit species groups in different zones is shown in table1 the point distribution of different fruit species groups varied greatly in the five zones in terms of woody fruits the proportion of sprinkler irrigation was the largest 100 in target zones a c followed by surge root irrigation 95 24 and furrow irrigation obtained the smallest percentage 42 86 the proportions at the whole growth period stage i stage ii stage iii and stage iv were 58 14 76 47 66 67 58 33 and 50 00 in target zones a c respectively the percentage of low degree 94 12 was higher than that of mild 71 11 moderate 46 55 and severe degree water deficit 50 in target zones a c the result showed that low deficit irrigation at stage i tend to save water and increase yield the percentage of sp 400 mm 200 400 mm and 200 mm was 69 14 27 78 and 27 78 respectively the percentage of sbd 1 35 g cm 3 was greater than that of sbd 1 35 g cm 3 67 09 and 22 22 respectively the percentage of 10 c and 10 c was 68 68 and 26 31 respectively the proportion of ph 7 was higher than that of ph 7 65 31 and 50 respectively the largest proportion occurred in loam soil 71 85 and effect sizes of sandy and clay soil accounted for 50 and 26 67 in target zones a c overall low degree 80 100 irrigation amount of fi di performed better at stage i or ii under sprinkler irrigation or surge root irrigation in loam soil with high sbd 1 35 g cm 3 and ph ph 7 in regions with sp 400 mm and aat 10 c in terms of herbaceous fruits there was a greater proportion of furrow irrigation 66 67 compared to surface drip irrigation 26 42 and subsurface drip irrigation 0 in target zones a d the proportion was lower in stage ii 10 00 but greater in stage i 30 00 whole growth period 31 03 stage iii 40 00 and stage iv 50 00 in target zones a d the largest proportion in target zones a d was observed under mild degree 55 00 followed by moderate degree 20 69 and severe degree water deficit 8 34 the largest proportion in target zones a d was found in sp 200 mm 75 00 followed by 200 400 mm 20 00 and 400 mm 13 89 the percentage of 10 c was 36 36 which was 15 9 higher than that of 10 c the proportion was higher in lower sbd 1 35 g cm 3 than that of soils with 1 35 g cm 3 40 00 and 26 31 respectively the smallest proportion in target zones a d occurred in clay soil 22 22 while the largest proportion was found in loam soil 30 00 overall mild degree 60 80 irrigation amount of fi di performed better at stage iv under furrow irrigation in loam soils with low sbd 1 35 g cm 3 in regions with sp 200 mm and aat 10 c in terms of vine fruits the percentage at stage i was the largest 100 in target zones a b followed by stage ii 88 89 stage iv 55 56 and the smallest percentages 0 was found in the whole growth period and stage iii the percentages under mild moderate and severe degree water deficit were 77 78 87 50 and 8 34 in target zones a b the percentage of sp 200 mm was 68 75 which was 25 00 higher than that of sp 400 mm the proportion of aat 10 c was more than twice that of aat 10 c overall moderate degree 40 60 irrigation amount of fi di performed better at stage i under surface drip irrigation in regions with sp 200 mm and aat 10 c 4 discussion 4 1 yield and wp of different fruit species groups different fruit species groups responded differently to water deficits cheng et al 2021c kang et al 2021 di reduced the yield of woody herbaceous and vine fruits by 13 74 20 51 and 9 03 and increased wp by 13 34 2 08 and 9 89 compared with full irrigation fi respectively previous studies found similar results demonstrating that di decreased woody and vine fruits yield cui et al 2008 and significantly increased the wp romero et al 2016 garcía tejero et al 2010 concluded that as compared to fi di reduced citrus yield by 10 12 but significantly increased wp by 24 herbaceous fruits were more vulnerable to yield reduction than woody and vine fruits under di the possible reason is the cell wall of herbaceous fruits are more likely to lose elasticity and cannot expand due to water stress leading to a decline in yield cui et al 2009 4 2 irrigation management effect on yield and wp the previous field experiments have demonstrated that fruits have different sensitivity and certain adaptability to water deficits appropriate water stress could transfer more photosynthetic products from vegetative organs to reproductive organs which is conducive to fruit growth and development riccardo et al 2019 low degree 80 100 irrigation amount of fi di performed better which can increase woody fruits yield and wp by 0 87 and 9 77 results similar to those reported by qiang et al 2015 who found that a low water deficit could promote fruit growth and yield 22 1 of jujube and improve the wp by 41 17 with respect to fi mild degree 60 80 irrigation amount of fi di declined the risk of herbaceous fruits yield reduction and significantly increased wp by 2 25 by adjusting osmotic pressure changing leaf structure and improving photosynthetic capabilities a mild water deficit may enhance photosynthesis moderate degree 40 60 irrigation amount of fi di performed better which can increase vine yield and wp by 8 05 and 13 87 the result is similar to those reported by cui et al 2009 who concluded that moderate water deficits partially inhibit the growth of vegetative organs but do not significantly reduce fruit yield when di is applied to fruit trees at a certain period the root growth can be regulated to prevent excessive root stem leaf and other component growth di can maintain each component grows optimally ensure root shoot ratios are balanced and improve economic yield and wp kang et al 2021 di is suitable for woody fruits in stage i or stage ii reducing the risk of yield reduction and increasing wp by 1 86 9 28 besides vine fruits are suitable for di in stage i which can increase yield and wp by 5 38 and 22 13 there were also similar results demonstrated by riccardo et al 2019 the appropriate water deficits during stages i and ii can suppress the growth of vegetative organs promote the accumulation of organic matter in reproductive organs rather than vegetative ones and enhance fruit growth di at stage iv performed better which can decline the risk of herbaceous fruit yield reduction and improve wp by 0 37 the result is similar to those reported by zhang et al 2018 who concluded that di at stage iv could maintain fruit yield and increase wp which was a suitable water deficit strategy for citrus surge root irrigation for woody fruits increased yield and wp by 1 81 and 11 89 respectively similar results were reported by wu et al 2010 who revealed that compared with the tube or drip irrigation surge root irrigation improved the yield and wp of jujube trees the most this may be because water is directly transported to the roots of the fruit trees using surge root irrigation reducing evaporation and wind resistance dai et al 2019 among irrigation methods furrow irrigation under di performed better for herbaceous fruits which can increase yield and wp by 0 66 and 2 29 the result is similar to those reported by graterol et al 1993 who concluded that furrow irrigation reduces water application without affecting soybean yield and thereby leads to more efficient water use 4 3 climate conditions and soil properties affect yield and wp precipitation and temperature are the main factors affecting fruit tree yield and wp yu et al 2020 di for woody fruits performed better in regions with sp 400 mm and aat 10 c which can decline the risk of yield reduction and increase wp by 13 1 13 23 the reason for this may be that higher precipitation and temperature could meet the growing need for woody fruits and promote photosynthesis cui et al 2009 on the other hand di performed better for herbaceous and vine fruits in regions with sp 200 mm and aat 10 c which can decline the risk of yield reduction and increase wp the reason for this may be that lower precipitation and temperature caused a decline in fruit evapotranspiration zheng et al 2019 di for woody herbaceous and vine fruits performed better in loam soils these results were in accordance with the findings of saitta et al 2021 who concluded that water savings of up to 53 were reached for the citrus grove in sandy loam soil under deficit irrigation di this may be because loam soil is conducive to root growth and maintain strong root activity and has good water retention property cheng et al 2021c however our study research is limited by the availability and feasibility of data our data collection standards mainly focus on the impact of di at different stages or the whole stage on yield and wp and largely ignore the effects of long term di on fruit yield and wp due to the insufficient data in vine fruits we were unable to evaluate the effects of soil ph on the response of yield and wp therefore future studies could be conducted after collecting more data moreover this meta analysis identify the optimal irrigation management strategy for woody herbaceous and vine fruits considering yield and wp however quality is also an important indicator to consider in irrigation decisions for fruits thus quality indicator needs to be analyzed to explore the optimal irrigation management strategy in the future 5 conclusions this study analyzed the effects of di on yield and wp of woody herbaceous and vine fruits under different irrigation management climate condition and soil properties di reduced the yield of woody herbaceous and vine fruits by 13 74 20 51 and 9 03 and increased wp by 13 34 2 08 and 9 89 herbaceous fruits were more vulnerable to yield reduction than woody and vine fruits under di low degree di 80 100 fi at stage i or ii under sprinkler irrigation or surge root irrigation performed better for woody fruits while mild degree di 60 80 fi at stage iv under furrow irrigation was optimal for herbaceous fruits and moderate degree di 40 60 fi at stage i was best for vine fruits for woody fruits di is suitable for higher seasonal precipitation sp 400 mm and annual average temperature aat 10 c in contrast for vine fruits and herbaceous fruits di is suitable for lower sp 200 mm and aat 10 c our study has determined the optimal irrigation management strategies for woody herbaceous and vine fruits considering yield and wp indicators furthermore in future research we need to consider quality indicators in irrigation decisions our results demonstrated that it is critical for different fruit species groups to choose the optimal irrigation management strategy declaration of competing interest the authors declared that they have no conflicts of interest to this

8853,the contribution of rock water to trees has been widely recognized but how effective rock water to managed ecosystems remains uncertain here we compared the contribution of rock water to apple tree transpiration in shallow soil overlying weathered rock sor with that from a thick soil without weathered rock ts we measured physical properties root distribution water contents water stable isotopes of soil and weathered rock the weathered rock layer in sor had significantly higher bulk density and gravel contents than that of soil layers in ts the volumetric water content and water storage of soil under sor were significantly higher than those under ts but the opposite is true for the available water content the weathered rock layer limited the vertical extension of apple roots with the maximum root depth was only 100 cm much smaller than 160 cm in ts additionally most of roots were in shallow soil in sor with the top 80 cm accounting for more than 91 of the total root length of the profile for sor relative to 61 for the ts water sourcing analysis indicates that the water in the weathered rock contributed 17 to the total water uptake in 2021 while the same depth increment of ts contributed 45 the low water uptake from the weathered rock limited the sap flow resulting in 27 yield reduction compared to ts yield therefore even though weathered rock is important for apple production its contribution is much smaller than the soil at the same depth increment to improve the rock water use is important for further improving the productivity of apple orchards on shallow soil underlain by weathered rock and should be incorporated into our routine orchard water management keywords rock water root distribution water uptake stable isotopes apple orchard

gmwl gobal meteoric water line data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction soil water provides the critical link between atmospheric precipitation surface water groundwater and biological earth cycle fedoroff et al 2010 oki and kanae 2006 similarly water in rocks as shown in recent studies also regulate the hydrological cycle and has important ecohydrological functions mccormick et al 2021 rempe and dietrich 2018 schwinning 2020 however the utilization of rock water by agricultural crop such as fruit trees remain uncertain understanding of which is a prerequisite for effective management of rock water for food production and adaptation for climate change rock water can be defined as water stored in parent material such as fractured rock and weathered rock plant water uptake from rock has been recognized but quantification of woody plant use of water stored in rocks has been conducted only recently mccormick et al 2021 rempe and dietrich 2018 in california usa with mediterranean climate rock fractures store 27 of the annual rainfall which is an important water source for deep root trees in dry periods rempe and dietrich 2018 in usa woody vegetation that accesses water stored in weathered rock accounts for over 50 of the aboveground carbon stocks in the state mccormick et al 2021 globally and annually 18 of plant water uptake relies on water stored in deeper unsaturated soils and or rocks miguez macho and fan 2021 stocker et al 2023 the utilization of rock water by plants may be determined by many factors the root system especially the fine root is the only direct organ for plants to capture soil water and nutrients from the soil adriano et al 2017 therefore the spatial distribution of root system reflects its potential for water utilization and absorption li et al 2022 a plant having a large root zone lateral or vertically or both can access a large soil reservoir and consequently can generally sustain their growth even during prolonged drought periods pierret et al 2016 however root distribution was not entirely consistent with their contribution to transpiration as it is also correlated to water availability at different depth of soil and different times of the year ehleringer and dawson 1992 capitalizing on spatially and temporally varying water availability different plants species can differ in their source water pools for coexistence and competition jackson et al 1995 the same trees of different ages may source their water from different sources or soil depths kühnhammer et al 2020 tao et al 2021b there is a hypothesis that shallow roots are primarily for nutrient uptakes because some of the nutrients are immobile and are only accessible by direct contact between the roots and the sites in soil where the nutrients are thus shallow roots are densely distributed dijkstra et al 2021 lynch 2018 zhou and feng 2020 deep roots or roots in nutrient poor portion of soil rock are mainly for water uptake to combat prolonged drought conditions and therefore can be less densely distributed deep soil or rock underlying shallow soil generally have less root than the shallow soil thus most roots in the soil profile are in shallow soil leaving a small proportion of the roots in the deep soil or rock layer consequently rock water deep soil is considered as maintenance pool which improves drought tolerance of plants schwinning 2020 shallow soil is a growth pool which supports primary production the key difference between these pools is that growth pools are densely rooted and are the main source of water during the growing season while maintenance pools are less densely rooted resulting in low extraction rates however there is increasingly more evidence of compensated root water uptake a small percentage of roots in a soil layer could take up unproportionate amount of water from the layer lei et al 2019 thomas et al 2020 but too few roots still limit the amount of water that could be taken up by plants šimůnek and hopmans 2009 moreover root distribution can be dynamic and may vary according to water availability to maximize the economy of carbon water trading the water taken at the water source by a plant should be used to assimilate more carbon than the carbon used to grow more roots toward the water source such as rock water this will normally require stabile water source so that growing roots toward the water source is economical germon et al 2020 guswa 2010 on the chinese loess plateau the same plant species such as fuji apple trees can grow roots progressively deeper to access water stored at greater depth as soil water within the root zone is depleted resulting in deeper root systems than many other locations around the world li et al 2019 this occurs in an exceptionally thick soil with a large water store at the other extreme shallow soil occupying 32 8 of the world land surface is frequently characterized by low water retention capacity fao 2011 it is especially prevalent in hilly regions and is typically underlain by rock regolith a large proportion of fruit trees grows on the hill slopes where the soil is shallow and developed above weathered rock however little is known on how orchards grown on these soils utilize the water in the weathered rock on one hand the presence of regolith if fractured could decrease the soil s ability to hold water and its high penetration resistance further prevent roots from proliferating the regolith therefore water stored in the rock regolith may not be available to plants nie et al 2012 penna et al 2021 on the other hand rock water provide additional water source for plants and plants can extensively use rock water or regolith water to meet their own growth needs mccormick et al 2021 nardini et al 2021 this wide spectrum of plant use of water stored in weather rock calls for an understanding of the controlling mechanisms we hypothesize that the physical properties of the weathered rock underlying shallow soil determine the availability of rock water and root distribution in the weathered rocks consequently dictating the plant water use of the rock water to test our hypothesis the objectives of this study are 1 to investigate the soil physical properties and root distribution in the weathered rock relative to soil without the presence of weathered rocks and 2 to determine the contribution of water in weathered rock to total root water uptake we selected two orchards grown on soil with and without the presence of weathered rock we characterized the physical and hydraulic properties of the two orchard soils monitored soil water contents for two years and measured the root distribution in soil profile we also measured soil water and xylem water isotopes three time in 2021 to determine the contribution of water from different soil increments to total root water uptake our study has important implications for incorporating rock water into regular orchard water management 2 research area and methods 2 1 site characteristics the study site is located at the modern apple industrial technology demonstration base 37 13 n 120 38 e in qixia city the hinterland of shandong peninsula china fig 1a it has a temperate monsoon climate characterized with hot and wet summers the average annual rainfall is 651 15 mm 1980 2019 of which more than 70 is received in summer and autumn yantai meteorological bureau shandong province china the annual average temperature is 12 05 with the highest daily temperature of 39 and the lowest of 16 1 frost free period is more than 180 days due to the strong influence of asian monsoons shandong peninsula is characterized by uneven spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation and frequent abnormal extreme weather events ding et al 2013 shandong peninsula is generally hilly and terraces were built in early 1970 s for annual crops and fruit trees the soil is predominantly silt loam texture underlying by weathered granitic genesis of different weathering degrees the soil is rich in calcium magnesium iron zinc and other mineral elements producing the brand name apple yantai apple with a planting history of over 150 years han et al 2023 due to high water demand apple trees are irrigated frequently with pond water organic amendment and inorganic fertilizers were generally applied through furrows along the trees dripline at a rate of 508 3 n 544 5 p2o5 521 8 k2o kg hm 2 chen et al 2021 all apples trees are pruned annually for maximum sunlight interception higher fruit yields and quality and easier worker access hand thinning are also conducted to control the fruit load and return bloom the following year bagging for preventing fruits from pest damage occurs in may till 3 4 weeks before harvest followed by reflective fabrics laid on the orchard floor to reflect sunlight back up into the tree canopy to improve fruit quality apple harvesting generally occurs in later october and early november typical apple yield in the regions is 38 84 t hm 2 fan et al 2018 fuji apple malus pumila mill is a common apple tree grown in terraced orchards in the study area the plant and row spacing were 3 m and 4 m respectively the stand age of the selected orchards was 15 year old the width and length of the plots were 10 m and 12 m respectively with average slope of about 10 in this study two typical apple orchards in the area were selected apple orchards grown on typical shallow soil overlying weather rock sor with soil thickness of 50 80 cm underlaid by weather rock strata and an orchard grown on thick soil with a thickness 4 m without weathered rock ts 2 2 data acquisition 2 2 1 measurement of meteorological parameters and volumetric soil water contents a meteorological monitoring system automatic weather meter usa was installed in early 2020 in the open area near the experimental orchards to measure meteorological factors during our study periods 2020 had the annual precipitation of 752 mm and can be classified as a normal year 2021 had total precipitation of 818 mm 31 more than normal and can be classified as a wet year in addition the average temperature in 2021 is 13 6 1 1 higher than the long term normal and 0 4 higher than 2020 according to the penman monteith equation the potential evapotranspiration for apple orchards in 2020 and 2021 growing seasons april to november were 1517 mm and 1628 mm which was much higher than the precipitation for the same periods a data logger cr 1000x campbell scientific usa was used to record soil water content every 10 min at each site three plots were selected in each of sor and ts orchards in each of the three plots a trench at 50 cm from a typical tree trunk was dug and a vertical face was exposed and soil horizon was delineated and described fig 1b then a metal ring was used to sample undisturbed soil at different depths in each horizon for the determination of soil physical properties including bulk density total porosity soil texture and saturated hydraulic conductivity subsequently tdr probes 315 h acclima usa were inserted horizontally at depths of 5 10 20 40 60 80 and 120 cm for measurement of soil water contents in one of the three plots in each of ts and sor orchards a data logger cr 1000x campbell scientific usa was used to record with an interval of 10 min at each site 2 2 2 root sampling the root system is assumed to be stable throughout the growth period in july 2021 a root auger with an inner diameter of 9 cm were used to sample roots within 0 2 m depths we selected 3 trees in each of sor and ts orchards and three sampling locations at 66 cm 132 cm and 200 cm away from each tree trunk for a total of 9 profiles in each orchard fig 1b the sampling depth of root profile was 0 160 cm for the sor orchard due to the underlying bedrock and 0 200 cm for the ts orchard with a sampling internal of 20 cm the collected soil samples were first rinsed in clear water through a 1 mm screen plant roots such as live roots dead roots and roots of weeds were separated according to their appearance color and elasticity then the live roots were transferred onto the screen of the scanner v850 pro epson japan with as little overlap as possible scans were performed with 300 dpi resolution subsequently the delta tscan image analysis software deltatscan delta t devices company uk was used to analyze the root images to obtain the root length surface area volume and other morphological parameters of the roots with different diameters after scanning electronic digital vernier calipers were used to distinguish fine roots 2 mm the dry root biomass was obtained through ovendry method for plant materials then the fine root length density frlds m m3 ﬁne root dry weight densities frwds g m3 and specific root length srl m g 1 were determined 2 2 3 water stable isotope sample collection soil and plant isotope samples were collected for isotope analysis from the two orchards sor and ts in 2021 growing seasons in a clear and sunny day at flowering and fruit setting stage may 25 fruit swelling stage july 25 and ripening and picking stage october 28 in each orchard four neighboring apple trees forming a rectangle with similar growth were selected at diagonal intersections three cores were taken with a hand auger to a sampling depth of 200 cm for each sampling for soil water isotopic composition determination considering that the surface soil water isotope composition can be altered strongly by evaporation and precipitation the sampling stratifications were 0 20 cm 20 40 cm 40 60 cm 60 80 cm 80 120 cm 120 200 cm with 6 layers replicated 3 times the collected soil was partitioned into two parts one was placed in an aluminum box to obtain soil water content by oven drying method and the other was placed in a 100 ml polyethylene bottle sealed with parafilm transported to the laboratory for storage on the same day and frozen at 4 until testing the average isotopic composition of each soil layers was calculated as the volumetric water content weighted average of the measured isotopic compositions of the three samples taken within a soil layer assuming no fractionation of plant water in the process of root uptake brunel et al 1995 chen et al 2020 wen et al 2022 we used the annual branches of plants for sap water extraction the sampling generally took place in the afternoon when sap flow velocity was high the obtained twig sample was then wrapped with parafilm and stored in containers with ice packs to prevent evaporation each treatment was repeated three times the samples were then transported to the laboratory for immediate water extraction daily precipitation samples were also collected at the study site and analyzed for isotopic compositions the local meteoric water line lmwl was constructed with precipitation isotope data collected daily during 2021 in experimental area 2 2 4 soil rock available water and soil storage water plant available water content is normally defined as the water content between field capacity and permanent wilting point but to be available for transpiration the available water must be fully accessible by roots it is possible that available water in a soil layer is unavailable for transpiration when there are no or limited roots in that layer in this study soil rock available water was defined as the real time soil volumetric water content minus the minimum soil volumetric water content during the observation period that is the water that could be used for evapotranspiration during the observation period 1 θ a z t θ z t θ min where θ a θ and θ min are the soil rock available water content cm3 cm 3 real time soil volumetric water content cm3 cm 3 at time t and the minimum volumetric water content cm3 cm 3 during the observation period soil water storage sws in the soil depth from 0 to the maximum root depth zr at time t is calculated as li et al 2018 2 sws t 0 zr θ z t dz 2 2 5 measurement of isotopic composition from soil plant and precipitation water samples and xylem water apportioning water from the soil samples was extracted using a cryogenic vacuum extraction system koeniger et al 2011 at the key laboratory of coastal ecohydrological processes and environmental security ludong university china briefly each soil sample was loaded into a 12 ml exetainer labco ltd uk and was gradually heated up to 205 c for more than 0 5 h with a system pressure of less than 10 pa the water collection bottle was connected through a 1 5 mm inner diameter stainless steel needle to a sample bottle immersed in liquid nitrogen the sample bottle was inserted in customized heating module that immersed in high temperature silicone oil the recovery rate was obtained by placing the post extraction sample in an oven at 105 c for 24 h samples were discarded if the extraction efficiency and recovery rate were outside the range of 99 101 for the plant samples we used the identical procedure as the above for soil sample except that the extraction temperature was set at 100 for 60 min the extracted soil water samples were analyzed through a lgr laser cavity ring isotopic spectrometer los gatos research iwa model 45ep usa each soil water sample was measured 6 times consecutively and the average value of the last 3 injections was selected as its representative value to exclude the influence of memory effect on the measured value the analytical errors for δ18o and δ2h were 1 and 0 2 respectively plant xylem water samples were analyzed with isotope ratio mass spectrometer 253 plus thermo fisher scientific usa at the ludong university the analytical errors for δ18o and δ2h were 0 2 and 2 respectively the isotopic compositions of the soil water xylem water and precipitation water were expressed using the delta notation 3 δ r sample r standard r st andard 1000 where rsample and rstandard represent the abundance ratio values of 18o 16o or 2h 1h in collected samples to that of international standard samples respectively recent studies have shown that conventional vacuum extraction may lead to a hydrogen offset ranged from 0 to 15 with an average of 8 5 for a variety of plant species in extracted xylem water compared to its water source barbeta et al 2022 chen et al 2020 wen et al 2022 but little bias is resulted in the measured δ18o in our study the measured δ2h and δ18o fall roughly on the soil water evaporation line suggesting the hydrogen offset in our measured δ2h is negligible therefore we did not perform hydrogen offset correction as suggested by he et al 2023 the contribution of soil or rock water at different depth increments to plant water was determined through the state of art mixsiar which is a model written in r language brian and semmens 2016 soil water at different depth increment in the root zone were considered potential water sources for apple trees according to soil physical properties water dynamics and root distribution the soil profiles were divided into surface soil layer 0 40 cm transition layer 40 80 cm and bottom layer 80 200 cm the contribution of each layer to plant water uptake was determined with root length density as prior information following stock et al 2018 the prior values were scaled by the total weight the informative prior information is calculated from fine root length density 4 p j frld z j j frld z j where p j is the value of the prior for depth increment j frld is the proportion at depth z within depth increment j of the total fine root length density mixsiar employs a markov chain monte carlo mcmc method to solve for the unknown source contributions in the current study the mcmc simulation length was set to very long and the error structure was process residual as described in stock and semmens 2016 the validity of individual model results was then evaluated using the diagnostic criteria provided in the model outputs 2 2 6 transpiration and yield of apple trees in this study the thermal dissipation probes tdp proposed by granier 1987 were used to measure trunk sap flow and each probe consists of two 1 mm diameter stainless steel tubes and were spaced 40 mm apart the upper tube contained a t type thermocouple tt t 36 sle omega engineering stamford usa and a 0 13 mm diameter heating wire 87 ω m 1 pelican wire co usa the lower tube contained only the t type thermocouple the tdp probe was mounted at 40 cm above ground with the probes horizontally into the trunk and pointing toward the center of a typical apple tree in each orchard after installation the probes were protected with spray foam and wrapped with radiation proof film to prevent disturbances and solar radiation from affecting the measurements cr1000x dataloggers campbell scientific logan usa were used to record temperature difference between the two probes at ten minute sampling intervals we adopted the constant heat method by applying continuous heating to the upper heater probe permitting continuous and frequent measurements of the sap flows sap flux density v is calculated by means of an empirical calibration equation with the only variable being the temperature difference dt between a vertically separated heater needle and reference needle inserted radially into the sapwood as proposed by granier 1987 5 v 0 0119 t m t t 1 231 where v is sap flux density cm s 1 t is the real time temperature difference between the two probes c and tm is the maximum t and occurs when there is no sap flow previous studies have shown that tm between probes can be obtained between 2 00 and 5 00 a m dawson et al 2007 therefore the mean value of the temperature difference during this time was used as the maximum temperature difference in this study as reported by granier 1987 typical values of v are from 10 to 80 cm h 1 in order to obtain convert the sap flux density to transpiration rate we need to obtain the relationship between tree circumference and sapwood area as such we obtained 14 freshly cut apple tree trunks from nearby apple orchards and an images of cross sectional sapwood was taken from each of the tree trunks imagej software v1 54e national institute of mental health bethesda maryland usa was used to measure the section diameter perimeter and area then the relationship between sapwood area and trunk circumference is established through linear regression the obtained relationship is shown in fig 2 the sap flow rate for a given sapwood profile can be obtained from the sap flux density as santiago et al 2000 6 f s v sa where f s is the transpiration rate cm3 s 1 and sa is the cross sectional area of sap conducting wood cm2 which was obtained from the measured tree trunk circumference tc through the relationship a s 8 52 tc 293 30 established in fig 2 the tree trunk diameters were 18 9 cm and 15 9 cm for the tree in sor and ts respectively resulting in a sap area of 183 5 cm2 for sor and 144 7 cm2 for ts stand level transpiration e s mm d 1 can then be calculated as 7 e s f s a b where a and b represent the spacing between plants and rows in the apple orchard respectively apple yields were obtained from the farmer who owns the two orchards each of 2019 2020 and 2021 the farmer picked all apples from each orchard and weighed the freshly picked apple right away the yields were obtained by dividing the total weight of apples from each orchard by the orchard acreage therefore there was no replicate because the yield we obtained is the population of the orchards not samples 2 3 statistical analysis spss 26 spss inc chicago usa was used for data statistical analysis paired t test was used to compare the differences between plots and one way anova and least significant difference lsd were used to compare and analyze the soil physical properties and root distribution the significance level was set at p 0 05 origin 2021 originlab corp usa was used to draw the figures and the data were expressed as the mean standard deviation 3 results 3 1 differences in soil physical properties between the sor and ts plots table 1 shows the measured soil physical and hydraulic properties as a function of depth for sor and ts for both orchards the bulk density increased with depth and the porosity and saturated hydraulic conductivity decreased with depth table 1 in contrast the bulk density below 40 cm was greater than 1 8 g cm 3 for sor which is much larger than that of ts paired t test shows that the two orchards did not differ in bulk density porosity and clay contents in the top 40 cm but differed significantly below 40 cm sor had an average gravel content of 40 g 100 g 1 below 40 cm significantly higher than in the top 40 cm of sor and in any depth of ts table 1 the saturated hydraulic conductivity in the top 40 cm of sor was 19 0 39 6 mm h 1 while that below 40 cm varied between 1 8 and 6 6 mm h 1 this reduction of hydraulic conductivity is consistent with the trend in bulk density ts had a similar trend table 1 remarkably the saturated hydraulic conductivity below 60 cm was at least one magnitude smaller than that of the surface soil for both orchards table 1 3 2 soil water dynamics fig s1 shows the measured soil water contents from the tdr monitoring location and replicated samples by ovendry method when isotope soil cores were taken at the three days clearly the two methods showed similar vertical trends for each of the two orchards sor and ts on each of the three dates this may suggest the tdr measurements from the single location in each of two orchards can capture the temporal and vertical patterns of the soil water contents in the orchards fig 3 shows the measured soil water contents at different depths sor had the average water contents of 0 32 cm3 cm 3 for both 2020 and 2021 which were much higher than the respective soil water contents in ts 0 22 cm3 cm 3 0 24 cm3 cm 3 the temporal variability of soil water storage in 60 120 cm differed between sor and ts over the two year period sor had a coefficient of variation cv of 0 05 and 0 06 for 2020 and 2021 which were significantly smaller than the respective cv of 0 19 and 0 14 for ts in the same periods the soil water contents responded to precipitation irrigation events differently between the two treatments fig 3a b c relative to ts cv 0 18 the soil water content in the top 40 cm of sor showed a stronger temporal variability cv 0 15 over the two year period three evident drought events occurred in july and nov 2020 and july 2021 for both treatments however excessively low soil water occurred frequently in the top 20 cm 0 12 cm3 cm 3 for sor 21 episodes with none extending beyond 40 cm depth fig 3b in contrast ts treatment showed only 8 episodes of low water contents in the surface soil but each drought event resulted in a relatively thicker depletion zone extending to 60 70 cm fig 3b c the soil water content at the 40 80 cm in sor was consistently above 0 30 cm3 cm 3 fig 3b a value near saturation when compared to the total porosity at the depths table 1 this is consistent with the low saturated hydraulic conductivity below 80 cm table 1 suggesting the dense layer below 40 appeared limiting the downward water movement and thus maintained the soil at near saturation for a prolonged period interestingly the soil water contents at 40 80 cm stayed occasionally below saturation the water contents reduced in july nov 2021 and june and july and august 2021 when there was prolonged period of limited rainfall or irrigation suggesting there was substantial root water uptake in sor in ts the whole soil water profile was quite uniform with notable reduction in soil water contents only during prolonged periods of droughts fig 3c fig 3f shows the temporal variations in soil water contents presented as statistical distribution by violin diagrams the median soil water contents in each depth increment increased obviously with depths in both 2020 and 2021 in sor fig 3f which is in sharp contrast to slight increase in ts reflecting the presence of the dense and low conductivity rock regolith in sor moreover the violin diagram for sor was bimodal for the 40 80 cm increment with the soil water contents of 0 37 m3m 3 and 0 30 m3m 3 as the two most likely values for both 2020 and 2021 regardless of the precipitation difference between the two years moreover the soil water content at 80 120 cm showed a relatively oblate monomodal diamond shape with an average at 0 30 m3m 3 fig 3f indicating there was little temporal variability this suggests that there was little recharge from precipitation and irrigation events and little depletion by root water uptake at the 80 120 cm depth increment in sor in contrast ts had a bimodal soil water content distribution for the 40 80 depth and for 80 120 cm both with the dry mode at about 0 22 m3m 3 and wet mode at about 0 3 m3m 3 this switching between the dry and wet modes could be due to recharge by precipitation and irrigation events and depletion by root water uptake fig 3d shows the available soil water contents in the soil profile for sor over the two years the top 80 cm displayed high available soil water contents between 0 07 and 0 16 m3m 3 however below 80 cm the stored soil water was rarely available except at drought conditions may sept 2020 may and sept to dec 2021 for ts soil water in the top 80 cm was generally available fig 3e but there were a few occasions that the whole profile was depleted with available soil water content 0 03 cm3 cm 3 when the surface soil was dry with the available soil water content 0 03 m3m 3 the soil below 80 cm was also frequently dry suggesting that soil water stored below 80 cm was available and can be taken up by plants fig 4a and b shows the available soil water storage for different depth increments for 2020 and 2021 for both sor and ts surprisingly below 80 cm there was little available soil water storage for sor and there was little response of available deep soil water storage to major irrigation or rainfall events therefore the high soil water content below 80 cm as shown in fig 4 did not transform into available soil water contents however ts had the available soil water contents similar to that in the top 40 cm after major irrigation or rainfall events this drastic change in the available soil water content may reflect root water uptake or deep drainage in ts fig 3d e the available soil water storage in the three depth increments fig 4 was generally higher in ts than in sor especially for the 80 200 cm depth increments with exception given to april and october 2020 and april and june in 2021 therefore although soil water contents below 80 cm in sor was greater than that of the ts the opposite is true for the available soil water storage the total available soil water storage as shown in fig 4c was generally greater in ts than sor p 0 05 3 3 root distribution as affected by the presence of a weathered rock layer the fine root length density frld ranged between 306 and 6773 m m 3 with an average of 2677 m m 3 for sor and varied between 265 and 3292 m m 3 with an average of 2024 m m 3 for ts frld generally decreased with depth for both sor and ts fig 5 however sor had much rapid reductions in frld with depth and became nearly zero at 160 cm in contrast ts had a nearly uniform distribution to 100 cm and then slowly reduced to zero at 200 cm fig 5a and frld distribution over depth differed significantly between sor and ts the maximum root depth defined as the depth above which 95 fine roots are located was 100 cm for sor and 160 cm for ts treatments therefore the root depth in ts is 50 more than that in sor fig 5b the above mentioned difference in frld is also evident in different depth increments fig 5a the sor treatment had twice greater root length density in the top 60 cm than the ts treatment but the trend reversed below 60 cm in terms of frld distribution in soil profile nearly 90 of the fine root lengths was in the top 60 cm of sor while the same amount is in the top 100 cm for ts fig 5b in the top 80 cm of soil sor had 91 of the total root length forming a high density root zone while ts had only 61 of the total root length in the same depth the specific root length decreased first and then increased for both sor and ts fig 5c the greatest specific root length was at the bottom of the root zone which was 100 160 cm for sor and 160 200 cm for ts between 80 and 160 cm the specific root length was much greater in sor than ts suggesting that the roots in sor were more active or the soil is so dense that only finer roots can penetrate through 3 4 isotopic composition of xylem water soil water and precipitation and inferred root water uptake fig 6 depicts the isotopic composition of precipitation soil water and plant xylem water for 2021 as expected the local meteoric precipitation line lwml plotted slightly lower than the global meteoric water line gwml craig 1961 sor soil water isotopes fluctuated from 55 51 to 21 54 for δ2h and 6 51 to 1 60 for δ18o and ts was from 62 19 to 16 19 and 7 82 to 1 89 respectively fig 6 isotopic compositions of soil water plotted lower than the atmospheric precipitation line indicating that the soil water was enriched due to evaporation soil water isotopic compositions at the middle and at depth were relatively stable being more depleted than the top 40 cm of the soil apple tree xylem water for sor had a δ2h range of 42 36 31 90 and a δ18o range of 5 53 3 57 for ts the respective ranges were 49 62 33 27 and 6 60 3 98 the xylem δ2h and δ18o values plotted along the soil water line fig 6 implying that soil and rock water was the source of water for the apple trees on average the weathered rock below 80 cm in sor had an average contribution of 17 to total transpiration in 2021 while the same depth for ts contributed 45 fig 7a b the low contribution from the weathered rock below 80 cm was compensated by the greater contribution of the top two layers the top layer 0 40 cm and middle layer 40 80 cm of sor contributed over 40 on average to the total transpiration as compared to 26 29 for ts fig 7a b moreover although the sap flux density measured during the growing season was not continuous for those date having measurements april to july the average daily transpiration rate at the stand level was 1 55 mm d 1 for sor and 1 71 mm d 1 for ts fig 7c and did not differ significantly between sor and ts however in the peak growth period june and july the average sap flux density was greater in ts than sor fig 7c suggesting sor was more water limited than ts when the evaporative demand is high and soil water content is low fig 3b c d e the measured apple fruit yields were 37 5 19 5 31 5 tons hec 1 in sor for 2019 2020 and 2021 respectively and 52 5 31 5 and 55 5 tons hec 1 in ts respectively therefore the average apple fruit yield in sor was only 63 of that in ts 4 discussion 4 1 weathering layer have distinct soil physical properties than the soil out results shows that sor and ts did not differ in soil physical properties in the top 40 cm but they differed significantly below 40 cm table 1 the sor plots below 40 cm was exceptionally dense with a bulk density between 1 81 and 1 91 g cm 3 table 1 the high bulk density values are not unreasonable because 1 the highly compacted weathered rock layer is consistent with our visual observation fig s2 when we dug the soil pit that the layer below the 40 cm depth was very compacted 2 the layer had a small total porosity table 1 which were independently determined by saturating the undisturbed core taken from the layer and then determining the saturated soil water content with ovendry method and 3 the gravel content below 40 cm in sor was 40 on average significantly higher than the soil above 40 cm in sor and all depths in ts table 1 the high gravel contents would substantially increase the bulk density given that the weathered rock is of granite origin with a density of 2 65 g cm 3 moreover the weathered rock is a mixture of rock sand silt and clay particles under pressure exerted from the soil above a condition conducive to high bulk density blake and hartge 1986 the ts treatment below 80 cm however also had a high bulk density 1 5 1 6 g cm 3 but the values were smaller than that of the sor treatment as also supported by the relatively large porosity table 1 the high gravel contents below 40 cm in sor may have a greater macroporosity than that of ts for the same depths giving a greater ks in the sor treatment than in ts this is also supported by our visually observed cracks and root channels during our excavation of the soil profile 4 2 weathering rock layers has reduced root growth the fine root length was considerably reduced when bulk density was greater than 1 7 g cm 3 for both sor below 60 cm and ts below 100 cm fig 5 table 1 this is consistent with the conclusion that root growth in general is restricted when the bulk density reaches 1 55 1 6 g cm 3 and is prohibited at about 1 80 g cm 3 blake and hartge 2018 moreover roots in the compacted layer were also finer than the roots in soil of either sor or ts as shown by the greater specific root length fig 5c this may be because the highly compacted weathered rock layer is dominated by small pores and roots can only penetrate through these pores which inhibits root thickening and elongation consequently the percentage of root system in root length density below 80 cm in sor to be less than 10 fig 5 a proportion substantially smaller than that in the ts plot 39 moreover during digging the soil profile we observed that some roots in the weathered rock layer was clumped in biopores of decayed roots and cracks fig s2 these clumped roots access much reduced soil area compared to normal roots and thus may actively reduce the water and nutrient uptake efficiency furthermore the high gravel contents in the weather rock layer are also detrimental to root penetration and proliferation one can imagine that when the lateral root tip hits gravels roots will have to buckle and find loose area or gap to elongate as there were likely small gaps between gravel and soil particle roots may eventually grow and form a net surrounding the gravels schwinning 2020 a condition limiting access to a large catchment area of soil and not favorable for active root water and nutrient uptake stirzaker et al 1996 therefore the high density and high gravel content layer below 40 cm in sor is not conducive to root penetration which results in a maximum root depth of only 100 cm fig 5a in comparison on the chinese loess plateau where soil bulk density is between 1 3 and 1 6 g cm 3 the same apple trees species have a maximum root depth over 20 m in dry land farming orchard under similar climate li et al 2019 20 times greater than the apple trees in our study area this further suggests that the high density nature of the soil in sor is likely the primary factor restricting the thickness of the root zone and the root length density in our study area 4 3 weathered rock layer altered soil water retention and contribution to total transpiration the soil water contents in sor above the weathered rock layer was generally higher throughout the two year periods compared to the ts treatment fig 3 soil water contents below 40 cm was consistently higher than the ts treatment fig 3 this is also supported by more frequent deletion of shallow soil in sor relatively to the less frequent but deeper soil water depletion in ts fig 3b c the average water contents at 40 80 cm soil layer in sor 0 32 cm3 cm 3 both in 2020 and 2021 respectively were higher than that ts 0 22 and 0 24 cm3 cm 3 in 2020 and 2021 respectively the temporal trends also show that the 40 80 cm had higher soil water content than the same depth for the ts signifying the influence of the compacted weathered rock layers therefore the sor had better retention of soil water greater and more stable throughout the two years relative to ts the higher soil bulk density and gravel content of the deep regolith and its low porosity and hydraulic conductivity may have prevented the deep soil water leakage which is similar to a study conducted in southeast asia ohnuki et al 2008 however the effective water storage below 80 cm in sor was low and stable this may suggest that relative to ts sor below 80 cm had limited roots fig 5a and thus most of the water stored below 80 cm was not accessible to roots the weathered rock is of gneiss origin the density of gneiss can be as high as 2 9 g cm 3 https rocks comparenature com en properties of gneiss model 12 6 accessed on june 10 2023 the resulting porosity for a bulk density of 1 8 g cm 3 is approximately 0 38 cm3 cm 3 which is similar to the highest measured volumetric water content fig 3b this near saturated soil water content is a result of low hydraulic conductivity of the weathered rock in contrast ts has a higher hydraulic conductivity and thus the soil water content is lower than the same depth for sor therefore despite of the low porosity in sor its water content remains higher than ts the drastic difference in soil physical properties and root distributions below 40 cm depth between sor and ts treatment also reflected in the root water uptake from the profile we sampled soil water and apple tree xylem water isotopic compositions in apple orchards in different growing seasons and xylem water apportioning analysis through mixsiar suggests that shallow soil 0 40 cm was the main water source for fruit trees in the study areas fig 7a b this result is consistent with liu et al 2021 who found that various plants in karst also obtained more than 40 of transpiration water from the 0 30 cm shallow soil the weathered rock layer contributed on average 17 to the total transpiration in 2021 fig 7a which is roughly 1 3 of that for the same depth increment from ts fig 7a b even so the weathered rock contribution in our study is still equivalent to the global average contribution 18 of deep soil rock water to total transpiration miguez macho and fan 2021 therefore the rock water for managed agroecosystems can be as an important water source as for natural ecosystems yang et al 2016 miguez macho and fan 2021 for ts the contribution from the soil below 80 cm 45 is large fig 7b this may be because in relatively coarse texture soil as our study site precipitation and irrigation water infiltration in soil is relatively quick and can easily reach to deep soil fig 3c as a result deep soil water content is often above the permanent wilting point and available in drought periods in contrary in fine textured soil the infiltration rate is substantially lower and large rainfall events could rarely reach deep soil and recharge deep soil leaving deep soil frequently at its lower limit of available water li et al 2019 tao et al 2021a the percentage of frld below 80 cm was 9 for sor and 39 for ts fig 5b which respectively contributed 17 and 45 to the total transpirations in another word 1 of roots from weathered rock below 80 cm in sor contributed nearly 2 to the total transpiration while same amount of roots from the same depth increment in ts contributed 1 2 to total transpiration this implies that the roots in the weathered rock were more active and efficient in root water uptake per unit root length than a similar root in ts additionally the contribution from 80 cm depth for ts was much higher on average and varied considerably relative to that of sor suggesting soil water may be the control for the contribution of deep soil water to total transpiration not the root length density therefore maximizing deep soil water storage in ts may be a management opportunity for the orchard in contrast the substantial contribution from the weathered rock layer did not vary much over the three sampling periods in 2021 suggesting the number of active roots below 80 cm in sor might be the limiting factors the number of active roots is related to the number of root hairs and how clumped the roots are therefore how to increase the number of actives roots in the weathered rock layer in sor may be the key to improve the rock water contribution to the total transpiration 4 4 implication for agricultural water management in orchards our results suggested that compared with deep soil the weathered rock under shallow soil is featured with higher bulk density lower permeability and smaller porosity in this context the weathered rock in subsoil becomes a stratum that impedes vertical infiltration and root growth beyond the shallow soil which considerably reduces water availability in the weathered rock the water stored in the root zone acts as a temporary buffer to balance any disparity between et and irrigation precipitation for shallow soil underlain by weathered bedrock large precipitation or irrigation events could easily trigger the formation of a saturated zone above weathered rock layer in the soil causing subsurface runoff or interflow on a slope therefore for effective agricultural water management in orchards growing on soil similar to sor irrigation should be more frequent and in smaller amounts than on soil similar to ts the high bulk density and gravel content of the weathered rock layer hindered the vertical growth of roots substantially reducing the number of roots in the weathered rock layer leaving the water stored in the weathered rock not efficiently used by trees therefore there is a great potential to improve the contribution of the rock water to plant transpiration in sor previous studies have shown that biological drilling can increase root distribution nambiar and sands 1992 therefore planting deep rooted grasses or shrubs in orchards where the weathered rock layer exists could create biopores this preexisting biopore could help apple trees proliferate their roots and increase their root biomass in the weathered rock layers supplementing bio drilling with appropriate water and fertilizer management measures we may be able to unleash the ecological potential and improve the productivity of the weathered rock layer in orchard soil in this study there were no replications in sap flux density measurements given the high spatial variability our sap measurement obtained from a single tree may not have large uncertainty however the sap lux measurements are supporting information and thus our conclusion may not be affected by the large uncertainty in addition more frequent measurements of plant and soil water isotopic compositions are needed to better understand the temporal variability of root water uptakes in the two plots 5 conclusions based on tdr automatic soil moisture monitoring root drilling and isotope tracing techniques this study comprehensively evaluated whether rock regolith moisture contribution to total root water uptake in apple orchard although there has been quite a few reports on the use of rock water by woody species in natural ecosystems to best of our knowledge this is the first study to investigate the rock water in managed ecosystems and what might be the control of rock water use by plants the results showed that the presence of weathered rock layer significantly increased the bulk density and gravel content which lead to reduced porosity and saturated hydraulic conductivity of the layer as a result the soil water content above the layer and below are consistently high relative to the ts without the weathered rock layer however the effective water reserves in sor are generally low especially at depths greater than 80 cm relatively to the ts without the weathered rock layer the presence of the weathered rock layer also increased the root length density above the layer but significantly reduced the root length density within the layer the weathered rock layer below 80 cm contributed about 17 of the total root water uptake in 2021 with little temporal variability this is in stark contrast to ts where the same depth increment contributed 45 to total transpiration with large temporal variability given there was only 9 of the total fine roots distributed and consistently high rock water content below 80 cm in sor the root water uptake from the weathered rock layer is most likely limited by the number of roots not by the rock water contents this study has important implication for understanding rock

8853,the contribution of rock water to trees has been widely recognized but how effective rock water to managed ecosystems remains uncertain here we compared the contribution of rock water to apple tree transpiration in shallow soil overlying weathered rock sor with that from a thick soil without weathered rock ts we measured physical properties root distribution water contents water stable isotopes of soil and weathered rock the weathered rock layer in sor had significantly higher bulk density and gravel contents than that of soil layers in ts the volumetric water content and water storage of soil under sor were significantly higher than those under ts but the opposite is true for the available water content the weathered rock layer limited the vertical extension of apple roots with the maximum root depth was only 100 cm much smaller than 160 cm in ts additionally most of roots were in shallow soil in sor with the top 80 cm accounting for more than 91 of the total root length of the profile for sor relative to 61 for the ts water sourcing analysis indicates that the water in the weathered rock contributed 17 to the total water uptake in 2021 while the same depth increment of ts contributed 45 the low water uptake from the weathered rock limited the sap flow resulting in 27 yield reduction compared to ts yield therefore even though weathered rock is important for apple production its contribution is much smaller than the soil at the same depth increment to improve the rock water use is important for further improving the productivity of apple orchards on shallow soil underlain by weathered rock and should be incorporated into our routine orchard water management keywords rock water root distribution water uptake stable isotopes apple orchard

gmwl gobal meteoric water line data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction soil water provides the critical link between atmospheric precipitation surface water groundwater and biological earth cycle fedoroff et al 2010 oki and kanae 2006 similarly water in rocks as shown in recent studies also regulate the hydrological cycle and has important ecohydrological functions mccormick et al 2021 rempe and dietrich 2018 schwinning 2020 however the utilization of rock water by agricultural crop such as fruit trees remain uncertain understanding of which is a prerequisite for effective management of rock water for food production and adaptation for climate change rock water can be defined as water stored in parent material such as fractured rock and weathered rock plant water uptake from rock has been recognized but quantification of woody plant use of water stored in rocks has been conducted only recently mccormick et al 2021 rempe and dietrich 2018 in california usa with mediterranean climate rock fractures store 27 of the annual rainfall which is an important water source for deep root trees in dry periods rempe and dietrich 2018 in usa woody vegetation that accesses water stored in weathered rock accounts for over 50 of the aboveground carbon stocks in the state mccormick et al 2021 globally and annually 18 of plant water uptake relies on water stored in deeper unsaturated soils and or rocks miguez macho and fan 2021 stocker et al 2023 the utilization of rock water by plants may be determined by many factors the root system especially the fine root is the only direct organ for plants to capture soil water and nutrients from the soil adriano et al 2017 therefore the spatial distribution of root system reflects its potential for water utilization and absorption li et al 2022 a plant having a large root zone lateral or vertically or both can access a large soil reservoir and consequently can generally sustain their growth even during prolonged drought periods pierret et al 2016 however root distribution was not entirely consistent with their contribution to transpiration as it is also correlated to water availability at different depth of soil and different times of the year ehleringer and dawson 1992 capitalizing on spatially and temporally varying water availability different plants species can differ in their source water pools for coexistence and competition jackson et al 1995 the same trees of different ages may source their water from different sources or soil depths kühnhammer et al 2020 tao et al 2021b there is a hypothesis that shallow roots are primarily for nutrient uptakes because some of the nutrients are immobile and are only accessible by direct contact between the roots and the sites in soil where the nutrients are thus shallow roots are densely distributed dijkstra et al 2021 lynch 2018 zhou and feng 2020 deep roots or roots in nutrient poor portion of soil rock are mainly for water uptake to combat prolonged drought conditions and therefore can be less densely distributed deep soil or rock underlying shallow soil generally have less root than the shallow soil thus most roots in the soil profile are in shallow soil leaving a small proportion of the roots in the deep soil or rock layer consequently rock water deep soil is considered as maintenance pool which improves drought tolerance of plants schwinning 2020 shallow soil is a growth pool which supports primary production the key difference between these pools is that growth pools are densely rooted and are the main source of water during the growing season while maintenance pools are less densely rooted resulting in low extraction rates however there is increasingly more evidence of compensated root water uptake a small percentage of roots in a soil layer could take up unproportionate amount of water from the layer lei et al 2019 thomas et al 2020 but too few roots still limit the amount of water that could be taken up by plants šimůnek and hopmans 2009 moreover root distribution can be dynamic and may vary according to water availability to maximize the economy of carbon water trading the water taken at the water source by a plant should be used to assimilate more carbon than the carbon used to grow more roots toward the water source such as rock water this will normally require stabile water source so that growing roots toward the water source is economical germon et al 2020 guswa 2010 on the chinese loess plateau the same plant species such as fuji apple trees can grow roots progressively deeper to access water stored at greater depth as soil water within the root zone is depleted resulting in deeper root systems than many other locations around the world li et al 2019 this occurs in an exceptionally thick soil with a large water store at the other extreme shallow soil occupying 32 8 of the world land surface is frequently characterized by low water retention capacity fao 2011 it is especially prevalent in hilly regions and is typically underlain by rock regolith a large proportion of fruit trees grows on the hill slopes where the soil is shallow and developed above weathered rock however little is known on how orchards grown on these soils utilize the water in the weathered rock on one hand the presence of regolith if fractured could decrease the soil s ability to hold water and its high penetration resistance further prevent roots from proliferating the regolith therefore water stored in the rock regolith may not be available to plants nie et al 2012 penna et al 2021 on the other hand rock water provide additional water source for plants and plants can extensively use rock water or regolith water to meet their own growth needs mccormick et al 2021 nardini et al 2021 this wide spectrum of plant use of water stored in weather rock calls for an understanding of the controlling mechanisms we hypothesize that the physical properties of the weathered rock underlying shallow soil determine the availability of rock water and root distribution in the weathered rocks consequently dictating the plant water use of the rock water to test our hypothesis the objectives of this study are 1 to investigate the soil physical properties and root distribution in the weathered rock relative to soil without the presence of weathered rocks and 2 to determine the contribution of water in weathered rock to total root water uptake we selected two orchards grown on soil with and without the presence of weathered rock we characterized the physical and hydraulic properties of the two orchard soils monitored soil water contents for two years and measured the root distribution in soil profile we also measured soil water and xylem water isotopes three time in 2021 to determine the contribution of water from different soil increments to total root water uptake our study has important implications for incorporating rock water into regular orchard water management 2 research area and methods 2 1 site characteristics the study site is located at the modern apple industrial technology demonstration base 37 13 n 120 38 e in qixia city the hinterland of shandong peninsula china fig 1a it has a temperate monsoon climate characterized with hot and wet summers the average annual rainfall is 651 15 mm 1980 2019 of which more than 70 is received in summer and autumn yantai meteorological bureau shandong province china the annual average temperature is 12 05 with the highest daily temperature of 39 and the lowest of 16 1 frost free period is more than 180 days due to the strong influence of asian monsoons shandong peninsula is characterized by uneven spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation and frequent abnormal extreme weather events ding et al 2013 shandong peninsula is generally hilly and terraces were built in early 1970 s for annual crops and fruit trees the soil is predominantly silt loam texture underlying by weathered granitic genesis of different weathering degrees the soil is rich in calcium magnesium iron zinc and other mineral elements producing the brand name apple yantai apple with a planting history of over 150 years han et al 2023 due to high water demand apple trees are irrigated frequently with pond water organic amendment and inorganic fertilizers were generally applied through furrows along the trees dripline at a rate of 508 3 n 544 5 p2o5 521 8 k2o kg hm 2 chen et al 2021 all apples trees are pruned annually for maximum sunlight interception higher fruit yields and quality and easier worker access hand thinning are also conducted to control the fruit load and return bloom the following year bagging for preventing fruits from pest damage occurs in may till 3 4 weeks before harvest followed by reflective fabrics laid on the orchard floor to reflect sunlight back up into the tree canopy to improve fruit quality apple harvesting generally occurs in later october and early november typical apple yield in the regions is 38 84 t hm 2 fan et al 2018 fuji apple malus pumila mill is a common apple tree grown in terraced orchards in the study area the plant and row spacing were 3 m and 4 m respectively the stand age of the selected orchards was 15 year old the width and length of the plots were 10 m and 12 m respectively with average slope of about 10 in this study two typical apple orchards in the area were selected apple orchards grown on typical shallow soil overlying weather rock sor with soil thickness of 50 80 cm underlaid by weather rock strata and an orchard grown on thick soil with a thickness 4 m without weathered rock ts 2 2 data acquisition 2 2 1 measurement of meteorological parameters and volumetric soil water contents a meteorological monitoring system automatic weather meter usa was installed in early 2020 in the open area near the experimental orchards to measure meteorological factors during our study periods 2020 had the annual precipitation of 752 mm and can be classified as a normal year 2021 had total precipitation of 818 mm 31 more than normal and can be classified as a wet year in addition the average temperature in 2021 is 13 6 1 1 higher than the long term normal and 0 4 higher than 2020 according to the penman monteith equation the potential evapotranspiration for apple orchards in 2020 and 2021 growing seasons april to november were 1517 mm and 1628 mm which was much higher than the precipitation for the same periods a data logger cr 1000x campbell scientific usa was used to record soil water content every 10 min at each site three plots were selected in each of sor and ts orchards in each of the three plots a trench at 50 cm from a typical tree trunk was dug and a vertical face was exposed and soil horizon was delineated and described fig 1b then a metal ring was used to sample undisturbed soil at different depths in each horizon for the determination of soil physical properties including bulk density total porosity soil texture and saturated hydraulic conductivity subsequently tdr probes 315 h acclima usa were inserted horizontally at depths of 5 10 20 40 60 80 and 120 cm for measurement of soil water contents in one of the three plots in each of ts and sor orchards a data logger cr 1000x campbell scientific usa was used to record with an interval of 10 min at each site 2 2 2 root sampling the root system is assumed to be stable throughout the growth period in july 2021 a root auger with an inner diameter of 9 cm were used to sample roots within 0 2 m depths we selected 3 trees in each of sor and ts orchards and three sampling locations at 66 cm 132 cm and 200 cm away from each tree trunk for a total of 9 profiles in each orchard fig 1b the sampling depth of root profile was 0 160 cm for the sor orchard due to the underlying bedrock and 0 200 cm for the ts orchard with a sampling internal of 20 cm the collected soil samples were first rinsed in clear water through a 1 mm screen plant roots such as live roots dead roots and roots of weeds were separated according to their appearance color and elasticity then the live roots were transferred onto the screen of the scanner v850 pro epson japan with as little overlap as possible scans were performed with 300 dpi resolution subsequently the delta tscan image analysis software deltatscan delta t devices company uk was used to analyze the root images to obtain the root length surface area volume and other morphological parameters of the roots with different diameters after scanning electronic digital vernier calipers were used to distinguish fine roots 2 mm the dry root biomass was obtained through ovendry method for plant materials then the fine root length density frlds m m3 ﬁne root dry weight densities frwds g m3 and specific root length srl m g 1 were determined 2 2 3 water stable isotope sample collection soil and plant isotope samples were collected for isotope analysis from the two orchards sor and ts in 2021 growing seasons in a clear and sunny day at flowering and fruit setting stage may 25 fruit swelling stage july 25 and ripening and picking stage october 28 in each orchard four neighboring apple trees forming a rectangle with similar growth were selected at diagonal intersections three cores were taken with a hand auger to a sampling depth of 200 cm for each sampling for soil water isotopic composition determination considering that the surface soil water isotope composition can be altered strongly by evaporation and precipitation the sampling stratifications were 0 20 cm 20 40 cm 40 60 cm 60 80 cm 80 120 cm 120 200 cm with 6 layers replicated 3 times the collected soil was partitioned into two parts one was placed in an aluminum box to obtain soil water content by oven drying method and the other was placed in a 100 ml polyethylene bottle sealed with parafilm transported to the laboratory for storage on the same day and frozen at 4 until testing the average isotopic composition of each soil layers was calculated as the volumetric water content weighted average of the measured isotopic compositions of the three samples taken within a soil layer assuming no fractionation of plant water in the process of root uptake brunel et al 1995 chen et al 2020 wen et al 2022 we used the annual branches of plants for sap water extraction the sampling generally took place in the afternoon when sap flow velocity was high the obtained twig sample was then wrapped with parafilm and stored in containers with ice packs to prevent evaporation each treatment was repeated three times the samples were then transported to the laboratory for immediate water extraction daily precipitation samples were also collected at the study site and analyzed for isotopic compositions the local meteoric water line lmwl was constructed with precipitation isotope data collected daily during 2021 in experimental area 2 2 4 soil rock available water and soil storage water plant available water content is normally defined as the water content between field capacity and permanent wilting point but to be available for transpiration the available water must be fully accessible by roots it is possible that available water in a soil layer is unavailable for transpiration when there are no or limited roots in that layer in this study soil rock available water was defined as the real time soil volumetric water content minus the minimum soil volumetric water content during the observation period that is the water that could be used for evapotranspiration during the observation period 1 θ a z t θ z t θ min where θ a θ and θ min are the soil rock available water content cm3 cm 3 real time soil volumetric water content cm3 cm 3 at time t and the minimum volumetric water content cm3 cm 3 during the observation period soil water storage sws in the soil depth from 0 to the maximum root depth zr at time t is calculated as li et al 2018 2 sws t 0 zr θ z t dz 2 2 5 measurement of isotopic composition from soil plant and precipitation water samples and xylem water apportioning water from the soil samples was extracted using a cryogenic vacuum extraction system koeniger et al 2011 at the key laboratory of coastal ecohydrological processes and environmental security ludong university china briefly each soil sample was loaded into a 12 ml exetainer labco ltd uk and was gradually heated up to 205 c for more than 0 5 h with a system pressure of less than 10 pa the water collection bottle was connected through a 1 5 mm inner diameter stainless steel needle to a sample bottle immersed in liquid nitrogen the sample bottle was inserted in customized heating module that immersed in high temperature silicone oil the recovery rate was obtained by placing the post extraction sample in an oven at 105 c for 24 h samples were discarded if the extraction efficiency and recovery rate were outside the range of 99 101 for the plant samples we used the identical procedure as the above for soil sample except that the extraction temperature was set at 100 for 60 min the extracted soil water samples were analyzed through a lgr laser cavity ring isotopic spectrometer los gatos research iwa model 45ep usa each soil water sample was measured 6 times consecutively and the average value of the last 3 injections was selected as its representative value to exclude the influence of memory effect on the measured value the analytical errors for δ18o and δ2h were 1 and 0 2 respectively plant xylem water samples were analyzed with isotope ratio mass spectrometer 253 plus thermo fisher scientific usa at the ludong university the analytical errors for δ18o and δ2h were 0 2 and 2 respectively the isotopic compositions of the soil water xylem water and precipitation water were expressed using the delta notation 3 δ r sample r standard r st andard 1000 where rsample and rstandard represent the abundance ratio values of 18o 16o or 2h 1h in collected samples to that of international standard samples respectively recent studies have shown that conventional vacuum extraction may lead to a hydrogen offset ranged from 0 to 15 with an average of 8 5 for a variety of plant species in extracted xylem water compared to its water source barbeta et al 2022 chen et al 2020 wen et al 2022 but little bias is resulted in the measured δ18o in our study the measured δ2h and δ18o fall roughly on the soil water evaporation line suggesting the hydrogen offset in our measured δ2h is negligible therefore we did not perform hydrogen offset correction as suggested by he et al 2023 the contribution of soil or rock water at different depth increments to plant water was determined through the state of art mixsiar which is a model written in r language brian and semmens 2016 soil water at different depth increment in the root zone were considered potential water sources for apple trees according to soil physical properties water dynamics and root distribution the soil profiles were divided into surface soil layer 0 40 cm transition layer 40 80 cm and bottom layer 80 200 cm the contribution of each layer to plant water uptake was determined with root length density as prior information following stock et al 2018 the prior values were scaled by the total weight the informative prior information is calculated from fine root length density 4 p j frld z j j frld z j where p j is the value of the prior for depth increment j frld is the proportion at depth z within depth increment j of the total fine root length density mixsiar employs a markov chain monte carlo mcmc method to solve for the unknown source contributions in the current study the mcmc simulation length was set to very long and the error structure was process residual as described in stock and semmens 2016 the validity of individual model results was then evaluated using the diagnostic criteria provided in the model outputs 2 2 6 transpiration and yield of apple trees in this study the thermal dissipation probes tdp proposed by granier 1987 were used to measure trunk sap flow and each probe consists of two 1 mm diameter stainless steel tubes and were spaced 40 mm apart the upper tube contained a t type thermocouple tt t 36 sle omega engineering stamford usa and a 0 13 mm diameter heating wire 87 ω m 1 pelican wire co usa the lower tube contained only the t type thermocouple the tdp probe was mounted at 40 cm above ground with the probes horizontally into the trunk and pointing toward the center of a typical apple tree in each orchard after installation the probes were protected with spray foam and wrapped with radiation proof film to prevent disturbances and solar radiation from affecting the measurements cr1000x dataloggers campbell scientific logan usa were used to record temperature difference between the two probes at ten minute sampling intervals we adopted the constant heat method by applying continuous heating to the upper heater probe permitting continuous and frequent measurements of the sap flows sap flux density v is calculated by means of an empirical calibration equation with the only variable being the temperature difference dt between a vertically separated heater needle and reference needle inserted radially into the sapwood as proposed by granier 1987 5 v 0 0119 t m t t 1 231 where v is sap flux density cm s 1 t is the real time temperature difference between the two probes c and tm is the maximum t and occurs when there is no sap flow previous studies have shown that tm between probes can be obtained between 2 00 and 5 00 a m dawson et al 2007 therefore the mean value of the temperature difference during this time was used as the maximum temperature difference in this study as reported by granier 1987 typical values of v are from 10 to 80 cm h 1 in order to obtain convert the sap flux density to transpiration rate we need to obtain the relationship between tree circumference and sapwood area as such we obtained 14 freshly cut apple tree trunks from nearby apple orchards and an images of cross sectional sapwood was taken from each of the tree trunks imagej software v1 54e national institute of mental health bethesda maryland usa was used to measure the section diameter perimeter and area then the relationship between sapwood area and trunk circumference is established through linear regression the obtained relationship is shown in fig 2 the sap flow rate for a given sapwood profile can be obtained from the sap flux density as santiago et al 2000 6 f s v sa where f s is the transpiration rate cm3 s 1 and sa is the cross sectional area of sap conducting wood cm2 which was obtained from the measured tree trunk circumference tc through the relationship a s 8 52 tc 293 30 established in fig 2 the tree trunk diameters were 18 9 cm and 15 9 cm for the tree in sor and ts respectively resulting in a sap area of 183 5 cm2 for sor and 144 7 cm2 for ts stand level transpiration e s mm d 1 can then be calculated as 7 e s f s a b where a and b represent the spacing between plants and rows in the apple orchard respectively apple yields were obtained from the farmer who owns the two orchards each of 2019 2020 and 2021 the farmer picked all apples from each orchard and weighed the freshly picked apple right away the yields were obtained by dividing the total weight of apples from each orchard by the orchard acreage therefore there was no replicate because the yield we obtained is the population of the orchards not samples 2 3 statistical analysis spss 26 spss inc chicago usa was used for data statistical analysis paired t test was used to compare the differences between plots and one way anova and least significant difference lsd were used to compare and analyze the soil physical properties and root distribution the significance level was set at p 0 05 origin 2021 originlab corp usa was used to draw the figures and the data were expressed as the mean standard deviation 3 results 3 1 differences in soil physical properties between the sor and ts plots table 1 shows the measured soil physical and hydraulic properties as a function of depth for sor and ts for both orchards the bulk density increased with depth and the porosity and saturated hydraulic conductivity decreased with depth table 1 in contrast the bulk density below 40 cm was greater than 1 8 g cm 3 for sor which is much larger than that of ts paired t test shows that the two orchards did not differ in bulk density porosity and clay contents in the top 40 cm but differed significantly below 40 cm sor had an average gravel content of 40 g 100 g 1 below 40 cm significantly higher than in the top 40 cm of sor and in any depth of ts table 1 the saturated hydraulic conductivity in the top 40 cm of sor was 19 0 39 6 mm h 1 while that below 40 cm varied between 1 8 and 6 6 mm h 1 this reduction of hydraulic conductivity is consistent with the trend in bulk density ts had a similar trend table 1 remarkably the saturated hydraulic conductivity below 60 cm was at least one magnitude smaller than that of the surface soil for both orchards table 1 3 2 soil water dynamics fig s1 shows the measured soil water contents from the tdr monitoring location and replicated samples by ovendry method when isotope soil cores were taken at the three days clearly the two methods showed similar vertical trends for each of the two orchards sor and ts on each of the three dates this may suggest the tdr measurements from the single location in each of two orchards can capture the temporal and vertical patterns of the soil water contents in the orchards fig 3 shows the measured soil water contents at different depths sor had the average water contents of 0 32 cm3 cm 3 for both 2020 and 2021 which were much higher than the respective soil water contents in ts 0 22 cm3 cm 3 0 24 cm3 cm 3 the temporal variability of soil water storage in 60 120 cm differed between sor and ts over the two year period sor had a coefficient of variation cv of 0 05 and 0 06 for 2020 and 2021 which were significantly smaller than the respective cv of 0 19 and 0 14 for ts in the same periods the soil water contents responded to precipitation irrigation events differently between the two treatments fig 3a b c relative to ts cv 0 18 the soil water content in the top 40 cm of sor showed a stronger temporal variability cv 0 15 over the two year period three evident drought events occurred in july and nov 2020 and july 2021 for both treatments however excessively low soil water occurred frequently in the top 20 cm 0 12 cm3 cm 3 for sor 21 episodes with none extending beyond 40 cm depth fig 3b in contrast ts treatment showed only 8 episodes of low water contents in the surface soil but each drought event resulted in a relatively thicker depletion zone extending to 60 70 cm fig 3b c the soil water content at the 40 80 cm in sor was consistently above 0 30 cm3 cm 3 fig 3b a value near saturation when compared to the total porosity at the depths table 1 this is consistent with the low saturated hydraulic conductivity below 80 cm table 1 suggesting the dense layer below 40 appeared limiting the downward water movement and thus maintained the soil at near saturation for a prolonged period interestingly the soil water contents at 40 80 cm stayed occasionally below saturation the water contents reduced in july nov 2021 and june and july and august 2021 when there was prolonged period of limited rainfall or irrigation suggesting there was substantial root water uptake in sor in ts the whole soil water profile was quite uniform with notable reduction in soil water contents only during prolonged periods of droughts fig 3c fig 3f shows the temporal variations in soil water contents presented as statistical distribution by violin diagrams the median soil water contents in each depth increment increased obviously with depths in both 2020 and 2021 in sor fig 3f which is in sharp contrast to slight increase in ts reflecting the presence of the dense and low conductivity rock regolith in sor moreover the violin diagram for sor was bimodal for the 40 80 cm increment with the soil water contents of 0 37 m3m 3 and 0 30 m3m 3 as the two most likely values for both 2020 and 2021 regardless of the precipitation difference between the two years moreover the soil water content at 80 120 cm showed a relatively oblate monomodal diamond shape with an average at 0 30 m3m 3 fig 3f indicating there was little temporal variability this suggests that there was little recharge from precipitation and irrigation events and little depletion by root water uptake at the 80 120 cm depth increment in sor in contrast ts had a bimodal soil water content distribution for the 40 80 depth and for 80 120 cm both with the dry mode at about 0 22 m3m 3 and wet mode at about 0 3 m3m 3 this switching between the dry and wet modes could be due to recharge by precipitation and irrigation events and depletion by root water uptake fig 3d shows the available soil water contents in the soil profile for sor over the two years the top 80 cm displayed high available soil water contents between 0 07 and 0 16 m3m 3 however below 80 cm the stored soil water was rarely available except at drought conditions may sept 2020 may and sept to dec 2021 for ts soil water in the top 80 cm was generally available fig 3e but there were a few occasions that the whole profile was depleted with available soil water content 0 03 cm3 cm 3 when the surface soil was dry with the available soil water content 0 03 m3m 3 the soil below 80 cm was also frequently dry suggesting that soil water stored below 80 cm was available and can be taken up by plants fig 4a and b shows the available soil water storage for different depth increments for 2020 and 2021 for both sor and ts surprisingly below 80 cm there was little available soil water storage for sor and there was little response of available deep soil water storage to major irrigation or rainfall events therefore the high soil water content below 80 cm as shown in fig 4 did not transform into available soil water contents however ts had the available soil water contents similar to that in the top 40 cm after major irrigation or rainfall events this drastic change in the available soil water content may reflect root water uptake or deep drainage in ts fig 3d e the available soil water storage in the three depth increments fig 4 was generally higher in ts than in sor especially for the 80 200 cm depth increments with exception given to april and october 2020 and april and june in 2021 therefore although soil water contents below 80 cm in sor was greater than that of the ts the opposite is true for the available soil water storage the total available soil water storage as shown in fig 4c was generally greater in ts than sor p 0 05 3 3 root distribution as affected by the presence of a weathered rock layer the fine root length density frld ranged between 306 and 6773 m m 3 with an average of 2677 m m 3 for sor and varied between 265 and 3292 m m 3 with an average of 2024 m m 3 for ts frld generally decreased with depth for both sor and ts fig 5 however sor had much rapid reductions in frld with depth and became nearly zero at 160 cm in contrast ts had a nearly uniform distribution to 100 cm and then slowly reduced to zero at 200 cm fig 5a and frld distribution over depth differed significantly between sor and ts the maximum root depth defined as the depth above which 95 fine roots are located was 100 cm for sor and 160 cm for ts treatments therefore the root depth in ts is 50 more than that in sor fig 5b the above mentioned difference in frld is also evident in different depth increments fig 5a the sor treatment had twice greater root length density in the top 60 cm than the ts treatment but the trend reversed below 60 cm in terms of frld distribution in soil profile nearly 90 of the fine root lengths was in the top 60 cm of sor while the same amount is in the top 100 cm for ts fig 5b in the top 80 cm of soil sor had 91 of the total root length forming a high density root zone while ts had only 61 of the total root length in the same depth the specific root length decreased first and then increased for both sor and ts fig 5c the greatest specific root length was at the bottom of the root zone which was 100 160 cm for sor and 160 200 cm for ts between 80 and 160 cm the specific root length was much greater in sor than ts suggesting that the roots in sor were more active or the soil is so dense that only finer roots can penetrate through 3 4 isotopic composition of xylem water soil water and precipitation and inferred root water uptake fig 6 depicts the isotopic composition of precipitation soil water and plant xylem water for 2021 as expected the local meteoric precipitation line lwml plotted slightly lower than the global meteoric water line gwml craig 1961 sor soil water isotopes fluctuated from 55 51 to 21 54 for δ2h and 6 51 to 1 60 for δ18o and ts was from 62 19 to 16 19 and 7 82 to 1 89 respectively fig 6 isotopic compositions of soil water plotted lower than the atmospheric precipitation line indicating that the soil water was enriched due to evaporation soil water isotopic compositions at the middle and at depth were relatively stable being more depleted than the top 40 cm of the soil apple tree xylem water for sor had a δ2h range of 42 36 31 90 and a δ18o range of 5 53 3 57 for ts the respective ranges were 49 62 33 27 and 6 60 3 98 the xylem δ2h and δ18o values plotted along the soil water line fig 6 implying that soil and rock water was the source of water for the apple trees on average the weathered rock below 80 cm in sor had an average contribution of 17 to total transpiration in 2021 while the same depth for ts contributed 45 fig 7a b the low contribution from the weathered rock below 80 cm was compensated by the greater contribution of the top two layers the top layer 0 40 cm and middle layer 40 80 cm of sor contributed over 40 on average to the total transpiration as compared to 26 29 for ts fig 7a b moreover although the sap flux density measured during the growing season was not continuous for those date having measurements april to july the average daily transpiration rate at the stand level was 1 55 mm d 1 for sor and 1 71 mm d 1 for ts fig 7c and did not differ significantly between sor and ts however in the peak growth period june and july the average sap flux density was greater in ts than sor fig 7c suggesting sor was more water limited than ts when the evaporative demand is high and soil water content is low fig 3b c d e the measured apple fruit yields were 37 5 19 5 31 5 tons hec 1 in sor for 2019 2020 and 2021 respectively and 52 5 31 5 and 55 5 tons hec 1 in ts respectively therefore the average apple fruit yield in sor was only 63 of that in ts 4 discussion 4 1 weathering layer have distinct soil physical properties than the soil out results shows that sor and ts did not differ in soil physical properties in the top 40 cm but they differed significantly below 40 cm table 1 the sor plots below 40 cm was exceptionally dense with a bulk density between 1 81 and 1 91 g cm 3 table 1 the high bulk density values are not unreasonable because 1 the highly compacted weathered rock layer is consistent with our visual observation fig s2 when we dug the soil pit that the layer below the 40 cm depth was very compacted 2 the layer had a small total porosity table 1 which were independently determined by saturating the undisturbed core taken from the layer and then determining the saturated soil water content with ovendry method and 3 the gravel content below 40 cm in sor was 40 on average significantly higher than the soil above 40 cm in sor and all depths in ts table 1 the high gravel contents would substantially increase the bulk density given that the weathered rock is of granite origin with a density of 2 65 g cm 3 moreover the weathered rock is a mixture of rock sand silt and clay particles under pressure exerted from the soil above a condition conducive to high bulk density blake and hartge 1986 the ts treatment below 80 cm however also had a high bulk density 1 5 1 6 g cm 3 but the values were smaller than that of the sor treatment as also supported by the relatively large porosity table 1 the high gravel contents below 40 cm in sor may have a greater macroporosity than that of ts for the same depths giving a greater ks in the sor treatment than in ts this is also supported by our visually observed cracks and root channels during our excavation of the soil profile 4 2 weathering rock layers has reduced root growth the fine root length was considerably reduced when bulk density was greater than 1 7 g cm 3 for both sor below 60 cm and ts below 100 cm fig 5 table 1 this is consistent with the conclusion that root growth in general is restricted when the bulk density reaches 1 55 1 6 g cm 3 and is prohibited at about 1 80 g cm 3 blake and hartge 2018 moreover roots in the compacted layer were also finer than the roots in soil of either sor or ts as shown by the greater specific root length fig 5c this may be because the highly compacted weathered rock layer is dominated by small pores and roots can only penetrate through these pores which inhibits root thickening and elongation consequently the percentage of root system in root length density below 80 cm in sor to be less than 10 fig 5 a proportion substantially smaller than that in the ts plot 39 moreover during digging the soil profile we observed that some roots in the weathered rock layer was clumped in biopores of decayed roots and cracks fig s2 these clumped roots access much reduced soil area compared to normal roots and thus may actively reduce the water and nutrient uptake efficiency furthermore the high gravel contents in the weather rock layer are also detrimental to root penetration and proliferation one can imagine that when the lateral root tip hits gravels roots will have to buckle and find loose area or gap to elongate as there were likely small gaps between gravel and soil particle roots may eventually grow and form a net surrounding the gravels schwinning 2020 a condition limiting access to a large catchment area of soil and not favorable for active root water and nutrient uptake stirzaker et al 1996 therefore the high density and high gravel content layer below 40 cm in sor is not conducive to root penetration which results in a maximum root depth of only 100 cm fig 5a in comparison on the chinese loess plateau where soil bulk density is between 1 3 and 1 6 g cm 3 the same apple trees species have a maximum root depth over 20 m in dry land farming orchard under similar climate li et al 2019 20 times greater than the apple trees in our study area this further suggests that the high density nature of the soil in sor is likely the primary factor restricting the thickness of the root zone and the root length density in our study area 4 3 weathered rock layer altered soil water retention and contribution to total transpiration the soil water contents in sor above the weathered rock layer was generally higher throughout the two year periods compared to the ts treatment fig 3 soil water contents below 40 cm was consistently higher than the ts treatment fig 3 this is also supported by more frequent deletion of shallow soil in sor relatively to the less frequent but deeper soil water depletion in ts fig 3b c the average water contents at 40 80 cm soil layer in sor 0 32 cm3 cm 3 both in 2020 and 2021 respectively were higher than that ts 0 22 and 0 24 cm3 cm 3 in 2020 and 2021 respectively the temporal trends also show that the 40 80 cm had higher soil water content than the same depth for the ts signifying the influence of the compacted weathered rock layers therefore the sor had better retention of soil water greater and more stable throughout the two years relative to ts the higher soil bulk density and gravel content of the deep regolith and its low porosity and hydraulic conductivity may have prevented the deep soil water leakage which is similar to a study conducted in southeast asia ohnuki et al 2008 however the effective water storage below 80 cm in sor was low and stable this may suggest that relative to ts sor below 80 cm had limited roots fig 5a and thus most of the water stored below 80 cm was not accessible to roots the weathered rock is of gneiss origin the density of gneiss can be as high as 2 9 g cm 3 https rocks comparenature com en properties of gneiss model 12 6 accessed on june 10 2023 the resulting porosity for a bulk density of 1 8 g cm 3 is approximately 0 38 cm3 cm 3 which is similar to the highest measured volumetric water content fig 3b this near saturated soil water content is a result of low hydraulic conductivity of the weathered rock in contrast ts has a higher hydraulic conductivity and thus the soil water content is lower than the same depth for sor therefore despite of the low porosity in sor its water content remains higher than ts the drastic difference in soil physical properties and root distributions below 40 cm depth between sor and ts treatment also reflected in the root water uptake from the profile we sampled soil water and apple tree xylem water isotopic compositions in apple orchards in different growing seasons and xylem water apportioning analysis through mixsiar suggests that shallow soil 0 40 cm was the main water source for fruit trees in the study areas fig 7a b this result is consistent with liu et al 2021 who found that various plants in karst also obtained more than 40 of transpiration water from the 0 30 cm shallow soil the weathered rock layer contributed on average 17 to the total transpiration in 2021 fig 7a which is roughly 1 3 of that for the same depth increment from ts fig 7a b even so the weathered rock contribution in our study is still equivalent to the global average contribution 18 of deep soil rock water to total transpiration miguez macho and fan 2021 therefore the rock water for managed agroecosystems can be as an important water source as for natural ecosystems yang et al 2016 miguez macho and fan 2021 for ts the contribution from the soil below 80 cm 45 is large fig 7b this may be because in relatively coarse texture soil as our study site precipitation and irrigation water infiltration in soil is relatively quick and can easily reach to deep soil fig 3c as a result deep soil water content is often above the permanent wilting point and available in drought periods in contrary in fine textured soil the infiltration rate is substantially lower and large rainfall events could rarely reach deep soil and recharge deep soil leaving deep soil frequently at its lower limit of available water li et al 2019 tao et al 2021a the percentage of frld below 80 cm was 9 for sor and 39 for ts fig 5b which respectively contributed 17 and 45 to the total transpirations in another word 1 of roots from weathered rock below 80 cm in sor contributed nearly 2 to the total transpiration while same amount of roots from the same depth increment in ts contributed 1 2 to total transpiration this implies that the roots in the weathered rock were more active and efficient in root water uptake per unit root length than a similar root in ts additionally the contribution from 80 cm depth for ts was much higher on average and varied considerably relative to that of sor suggesting soil water may be the control for the contribution of deep soil water to total transpiration not the root length density therefore maximizing deep soil water storage in ts may be a management opportunity for the orchard in contrast the substantial contribution from the weathered rock layer did not vary much over the three sampling periods in 2021 suggesting the number of active roots below 80 cm in sor might be the limiting factors the number of active roots is related to the number of root hairs and how clumped the roots are therefore how to increase the number of actives roots in the weathered rock layer in sor may be the key to improve the rock water contribution to the total transpiration 4 4 implication for agricultural water management in orchards our results suggested that compared with deep soil the weathered rock under shallow soil is featured with higher bulk density lower permeability and smaller porosity in this context the weathered rock in subsoil becomes a stratum that impedes vertical infiltration and root growth beyond the shallow soil which considerably reduces water availability in the weathered rock the water stored in the root zone acts as a temporary buffer to balance any disparity between et and irrigation precipitation for shallow soil underlain by weathered bedrock large precipitation or irrigation events could easily trigger the formation of a saturated zone above weathered rock layer in the soil causing subsurface runoff or interflow on a slope therefore for effective agricultural water management in orchards growing on soil similar to sor irrigation should be more frequent and in smaller amounts than on soil similar to ts the high bulk density and gravel content of the weathered rock layer hindered the vertical growth of roots substantially reducing the number of roots in the weathered rock layer leaving the water stored in the weathered rock not efficiently used by trees therefore there is a great potential to improve the contribution of the rock water to plant transpiration in sor previous studies have shown that biological drilling can increase root distribution nambiar and sands 1992 therefore planting deep rooted grasses or shrubs in orchards where the weathered rock layer exists could create biopores this preexisting biopore could help apple trees proliferate their roots and increase their root biomass in the weathered rock layers supplementing bio drilling with appropriate water and fertilizer management measures we may be able to unleash the ecological potential and improve the productivity of the weathered rock layer in orchard soil in this study there were no replications in sap flux density measurements given the high spatial variability our sap measurement obtained from a single tree may not have large uncertainty however the sap lux measurements are supporting information and thus our conclusion may not be affected by the large uncertainty in addition more frequent measurements of plant and soil water isotopic compositions are needed to better understand the temporal variability of root water uptakes in the two plots 5 conclusions based on tdr automatic soil moisture monitoring root drilling and isotope tracing techniques this study comprehensively evaluated whether rock regolith moisture contribution to total root water uptake in apple orchard although there has been quite a few reports on the use of rock water by woody species in natural ecosystems to best of our knowledge this is the first study to investigate the rock water in managed ecosystems and what might be the control of rock water use by plants the results showed that the presence of weathered rock layer significantly increased the bulk density and gravel content which lead to reduced porosity and saturated hydraulic conductivity of the layer as a result the soil water content above the layer and below are consistently high relative to the ts without the weathered rock layer however the effective water reserves in sor are generally low especially at depths greater than 80 cm relatively to the ts without the weathered rock layer the presence of the weathered rock layer also increased the root length density above the layer but significantly reduced the root length density within the layer the weathered rock layer below 80 cm contributed about 17 of the total root water uptake in 2021 with little temporal variability this is in stark contrast to ts where the same depth increment contributed 45 to total transpiration with large temporal variability given there was only 9 of the total fine roots distributed and consistently high rock water content below 80 cm in sor the root water uptake from the weathered rock layer is most likely limited by the number of roots not by the rock water contents this study has important implication for understanding rock

8854,improving water productivity with the aim of more production and less water use is considered one effective strategic option for managing irrigation under water deficit conditions in order to investigate the effect of irrigation regimes and application of different concentrations of tragacanth gum on the black cumin plant a factorial experiment was conducted based on a completely randomized design with three replications in a greenhouse of the agriculture faculty of kurdistan university in kurdistan in 2018 2020 and 2021 seasons the experimental factors included irrigation at

s life cycle jansen and potters 2017 climate change is one of the major environmental problems that humanity has faced in the past two decades abbass et al 2022 shayanmehr et al 2022 continuous droughts and increased heat flux that have emerged or intensified due to these climatic changes cause plenty of problems for the production of plant products in the future vicente serrano et al 2014 medrano et al 2015 non biological stresses such as heat and drought are the most important environmental factors that often reduce growth and crop yield sita et al 2017 in addition to reducing vegetative growth and altering the anatomical structures of the plant drought stress changes the pathways used to synthesize secondary chemicals and metabolites by inducing secondary stress such as oxidative stress sharma et al 2012 many studies have reported the accumulation of reactive oxygen species ros and its damage during drought stress miller et al 2010 hasanuzzaman et al 2014 in droughts damage to the photosystem ii inhibits other components of the electron transport chain thereby reducing photosynthetic electron transfer leading to a loss of a significant percentage of the absorbed light energy in the form of heat and fluorescence wang et al 2018 the use of anti transpirant agents effectively reduces the effects of drought stress on plants and adjustment the reduction of the yield due to water deficiency in arid and semi arid regions dass and bhattacharyya 2017 morsy and mehanna 2022 in fact anti transpirant materials prevent the reduction of plant yield by decreasing transpiration and increasing water use efficiency abdullah et al 2015 abdallah et al 2019a research has shown that anti transpirant coatings reduce transpiration and maintain plant water as well as reduce the permeability of leaves to co2 exchange and thus reduce photosynthesis lipe and skinner 1979 however recent studies have shown that the ability to control water in the plant improves drought tolerance in the plant bramley et al 2013 according to abdullah et al 2015 there was an increase in photosynthesis due to anti transpirant agents during drought stress contrary to bistgani et al 2017 and dass and bhattacharyya 2017 hypotheses that anti transpirant agents always harm carbon dioxide exchange this indicates a relative improvement in plant water status and leaf pressure probably due to the soil s moisture storage abdullah et al 2015 therefore the relative improvement in plant water status and leaf pressure may result in carbon dioxide stabilization in durum wheat araus et al 1993 tambussi et al 2005 research results have shown that using anti transpirant agents before the flowering stage reduces grain sterility in wheat kettlewell et al 2010 abdullah et al 2015 there has been much research on the effects of anti transpirant agents on various products such as wheat kettlewell et al 2010 kettlewell 2014 basil malekpoor et al 2016 thyme bistgani et al 2017 soybean dass and bhattacharyya 2017 and bell pepper del amor et al 2010 however no studies have been done on the effect of anti transpirant agents on black cumin nigella sativa black cumin is a one year old plant belonging to southwest asia which has many industrial and medicinal uses kabiri et al 2014 espanany et al 2016 black cumin has been used in traditional iranian medicine nickavar et al 2003 although past research has shown that black cumin is resistant to water deficiency bannayan et al 2008 drought stress is an environmental factor that reduces the yield of black cumin rezaei chiyaneh et al 2018 which may be due to the sensitivity of the plant to water deficiency at flowering stage in the mediterranean regions drought stress is inevitable and reduces the growth and yield of plants including black cumin haj seyed hadi et al 2016 establishing a balance between the amount of water consumed by the plant and the amount of available water is a fundamental objective in the agricultural sector especially in arid and semi arid regions where water is a limiting factor for plant growth kang et al 2009 yi et al 2022 researchers have always been looking at ways to reduce the loss of water from the transpiration of aerial plant organs and increase water use efficiency this subject becomes more important when plants are considered water spenders abdallah et al 2018 morsy and mehanna 2022 because the amount of water consumed by plants for photosynthesis is less than 5 of the plant s total water use and the remainder is emitted by the transpiration from the plant dawson et al 1996 prakash and ramachandran 2000 in fact transpiration is a necessary process for photosynthesis and depending on the conditions may be harmful in some cases so the use of anti transpirant is one of the most effective methods for reducing the amount of water lost through transpiration abdullah et al 2015 abdallah et al 2019a some anti transpirant materials with certain biological activities reduce the plant s transpiration rate it also improves the damaging effects of drought stress on plants due to increased leaf resistance to water loss moftah 1997 based on the method of action anti transpirant compounds are divided into three groups anti transpirant coating compounds cover the surface of the leaf completely block the stomata and prevent water from leaving the surface of the leaves effulgent anti transpirant compounds increase shine and reflection of sunlight and reduce the absorption of heat energy and stomata blocker anti transpirant compounds close stomata by stimulating some physiological processes abdallah et al 2019a generally the anti transpirant coatings the emulsion from wax latex or plastic are sprayed on the foliage and reduce stomatal conduction abdallah et al 2018 tragacanth is a natural gum and anionic polysaccharide that is secreted from asian species of astraglus gummifer plant tragacanth plant is found with a height of 0 1 1 m in the height and desert regions of iran turkey iraq syria lebanon afghanistan pakistan and russia different species of tragacanth plants are dispersed in most parts of iran especially in the central area to the west and in the zagros mountainous regions iran is the world s largest tragacanth producer and iranian tragacanth has the highest quality among tragacanths produced in neighboring countries verbeken et al 2014 tragacanth is both stabilizer and reduces surface tension it has long been widely used in the food pharmaceutical cosmetics textile and medical industries tavakol and mohammadifar 2017 in addition to reducing surface tension tragacanth can act as a thickener and these two properties have increased the use of this material in the food pharmaceutical and cosmetics industries gavlighi et al 2013 supplying the food need of the growing population of the world requires increased production and yield per unit area therefore improving crop yield under drought stress is the goal of agricultural researchers worldwide manavalan and nguyen 2017 climate change created in the world and the intensification of stresses caused by it especially drought stress in arid and semi arid regions such as iran make it challenging to achieve this goal shayanmehr et al 2022 therefore finding strategies that can reduce the effects of water shortages on plants and improve their growth and yield can be very worthwhile given the coating properties of tragacanth gel the idea came to the mind of the authors of this paper that this substance could be used as an anti transpirant coating to reduce water loss through transpiration without reducing plant growth and yield in order to determine if there is a positive impact on plant growth and yield under water deficiency conditions tragacanth is introduced for the first time as a new anti transpirant substance of organic origin and presented to the world of agriculture the study s objective was to investigate the effect of foliar application of different doses of tragacanth on the aqueous relations of plants physiological characteristics and black cumin grain weight under different irrigation regimes 2 materials and methods 2 1 experiment conditions and treatments this research was carried out in a factorial experiment with a completely randomized design with three replications the experiments took place in a

according to soil analysis 25 kg of nitrogen per hectare of urea source 50 kg ha of potassium k2o and 70 kg ha of phosphorus p2o5 were added to the soil in each pot 14 seeds of black cumin 200 plants per square meter were cultivated at first 20 seeds were planted in each pot and after germination and ensuring the establishment of the plant four leaf stage 14 plants were kept in each pot one replication including 18 planted pots was used for destructive sampling irrigation treatments were applied one week before flowering floral bud appearance stage and continued for 40 days 9 stages and up to 10 days before harvest physiological maturity browning of 75 of capsules prior to applying irrigation treatments irrigation was entirely performed for all treatments every five days all the pots reached the fc the pots were shifted during each watering operation to reduce or altogether remove the error caused by the pots original position in the greenhouse the weighing method determined the time of irrigation treatments percentage of fc in pots irrigation was carried out at intervals of 5 days in each irrigation event the weight of the pot under full irrigation and without foliar application with tragacanth was the criterion after five days the amount of water needed to reach the fc was determined and consumed for 40 and 70 of irrigation treatments 40 and 70 of the water required for full irrigation treatment were used in pots where their required water was less than water consumed in full irrigation without foliar application excess water was calculated as stored water to be considered in calculating the water use efficiency at the same time as applying irrigation treatments tragacanth extract was sprayed at the beginning of budding for this purpose weighed tragacanth values from the rangelands of kurdistan province a gummifer were dissolved in 1 liter of tepid water after 24 h mixed with a mixer for 5 min to be completely uniform this material was sprayed using a back sprayer shark model with a constant pressure of 2 4 bar and 250 liters of water per hectare when the foliar application a nylon curtain was placed between the pots to prevent the substance from splashing into the other pots 2 2 features of tragacanth tragacanth is a good quality hydrocolloid that is a non uniform and highly branched hydrophilic carbohydrate in terms of chemical composition tragacanth consists of two main components called tragacantic acid or basourin and tragacanthin basourin accounts for 60 70 of total gum and is a water insoluble component that can swell and form a gel the other component tragacanthin is dissolved in water and forms a colloidal solution basourin is an acidic component that produces sugars such as d xylose l fucose d galacturonic acid and a small amount of l rhamnose through acid hydrolysis the acid component of this molecule is also related to cations of calcium magnesium and potassium properties of tragacanth gum are related mainly to basourin tragacanthin is considered a neutral polysaccharide component that consists of sequential d galactose units and the branched chains of l arabinose are jointed to it there are significant amounts of methoxyl groups in its structure tavakol and mohammadifar 2017 2 3 studied characteristics all characteristics were measured 15 days after the application of the

drawn using excel software version 16 0 2 5 results 2 5 1 the weight of the pots fig 1 a c shows that with increasing drought stress pots weight decreased so after applying irrigation treatments in all irrigation stages the highest and lowest weights of pots were achieved under full irrigation conditions and severe drought stress respectively the results also indicate that foliar application the plant with tragacanth extract affects the weight of the pots in full irrigation treatment with increasing concentration of tragacanth application the weight of the pots increased so that at concentrations of 5 7 5 and 10 g l water consumption was higher than the need for black cumin for this reason it was recorded as stored water and considered in calculating water use efficiency also in drought stress treatments irrigation of 70 and 40 of fc of soil at higher concentrations of tragacanth application 10 g l the weight of pots was higher foliar application of the tragacanth solution on the plant reduced the plant s transpiration and consequently the amount of water consumed by the plant in different irrigation regimes fig 1 2 5 2 osmotic potential of the leaf the interaction of irrigation regimes and the application of different concentrations of tragacanth on osmotic potential was significant p 0 01 supplementary tables s1 s2 and s3 drought stress enhanced the plant s osmotic potential in three seasons fig 2 in 2018 season irrigation at 70 fc and 2 5 g l of tragacanth gum and full irrigation at 1 25 g l exhibited the lowest osmotic potential 2 a full irrigation and 2 5 and 1 5 g l of tragacanth gum had the lowest osmotic potential in 2020 2b in 2021 season full irrigation with 2 5 1 25 and 5 g l of tragacanth gum application was placed in a statistical group with consumption of 5 and 7 5 g l at 70 of the fc that resulted in the lowest osmotic potential 2 c our results illustrated that in various irrigation regimes tragacanth extract concentrations affected leaf osmotic potential differently in 2018 season in full irrigation and 70 of the fc consumption of tragacanth gum up to 1 25 g l and 2 5 g l respectively reduced osmotic potential and concentrations higher resulted in a more negative osmotic potential of the plant in irrigation at 40 fc raising the tragacanth extract content to 5 g l decreased the osmotic potential the osmotic potential increased at a higher concentration 10 g l which is more negative in full irrigation in the 2020 and 2021 seasons 2 5 g l tragacanth gum reduced osmotic potential however concentrations higher than 2 5 g l increased the negative osmotic potential of the plant tragacanth extracts up to 7 5 g l reduced the osmotic potential in irrigation at 70 and 40 of the fc however the osmotic potential increased at a higher concentration 10 g l which is more negative fig 2b and c fc field capacity 13 500 g for a 13 800 g for b and c 100 0 100 1 25 100 2 5 100 5 100 7 5 and 100 10 100

and pwp permanent wilting point 12 300 g for a 12 800 g for b and c 2 5 3 pressure potential of leaf in three experiment seasons the interaction of irrigation regimes and application of different concentrations of tragacanth on pressure potential was significant p 0 01 supplementary tables s1 s2 and s3 in three seasons of experiments the highest pressure potential was obtained in full irrigation drought stress significantly reduced leaf pressure potential on average according to all foliar treatments leaf pressure potential in moderate and severe stress conditions compared to full irrigation decreased by 49 and 396 for the 2018 season 59 and 350 for the 2020 season and 62 and 384 for the 2021 season respectively fig 2 at all concentrations of tragacanth extract plants under irrigation at 70 and 40 of the fc were ranked after full irrigation according to leaf pressure potential the effect of different concentrations of foliar application of tragacanth on the amount of leaf pressure potential was different in different irrigation regimes in three seasons of the experiment in 100 70 and 40 fc irrigation treatments foliar application of the black cumin up to 2 5 5 and 7 5 g l increased pressure potential and concentrations higher than mentioned amounts for these irrigation levels reduced the pressure potential fig 2 2 5 4 leaf water potential in the present study the water potential of black cumin leaves was influenced by the amount of pressure and osmotic potentials the interaction of irrigation regimes and the application of different concentrations of tragacanth on water potential was significant p 0 01 supplementary tables s1 s2 and s3 fig 2 demonstrates that in all concentrations of tragacanth application full irrigation treatment had the largest leaf water potential while 70 and 40 of irrigation treatments had less drought stress and its increasing intensity significantly reduced leaf water potential more negative so that on average leaf water potential in moderate and severe stress conditions compared to full irrigation decreased by approximately 73 and 260 for the 2018 season 60 and 250 for the 2020 season and 47 and 230 for the 2021 season respectively fig 2 the water potential of black cumin leaves dropped less after foliar application of tragacanth due to its positive effects on decreasing osmotic potential and increasing pressure potential the varying concentrations of foliar tragacanth extract on leaf osmotic and pressure potentials in different irrigation regimes affected leaf water potential the trend of changes in plant water potential at different irrigation levels under different concentrations of tragacanth extract was similar to the process of changes in plant pressure potential under the influence of these treatments the plant s water potential has increased with tragacanth extract in different irrigation regimes tragacanth use up to 2 5 g l under full irrigation 5 g l 2018 season and 7 5 g l 2020 and 2021 seasons under moderate drought stress and 7 5 g l under severe drought stress increases water plant potential at higher concentrations it causes a significant reduction fig 2a c tp 40 tp 70 and tp 100 turgor or pressure potential at three levels of 100 full irrigation 70 moderate drought stress and 40 severe drought stress of fc of soil respectively wp 40 wp 70 and wp 100 water potential at three levels of 100 full irrigation 70 moderate drought stress and 40 severe drought stress of fc of soil respectively and sp 40 sp 70 and sp 100 osmotic potential at three levels of 100 full irrigation 70 moderate drought stress and 40 severe drought stress of fc of soil respectively 2 5 5 the relative water content rwc in three experiments the interaction of irrigation regimes and application of different concentrations of tragacanth on rwc was significant p 0 01 supplementary tables s1 s2 and s3 different irrigation regimes affect leaf rwc in our study full irrigation and severe drought stress treatments led to the highest and lowest leaf rwc in all tragacanth concentrations respectively the results indicated that different concentrations of tragacanth extract had completely different effects in different irrigation regimes in full irrigation and severe drought stress conditions leaf rwc was maximum at 1 25 and 2 5 g l respectively higher concentrations reduced leaf rwc therefore in two irrigation regimes 7 5 and 10 g l concentrations decreased leaf rwc compared to the control without foliar application under severe drought stress the leaf rwc was maximum at 5 g l and significantly decreased at 10 g l fig 3 a c 2 5 6 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 content in the present study the interaction of irrigation regimes and application of different concentrations of tragacanth on h2o2 content was significant p 0 01 supplementary tables s1 s2 and s3 as shown in fig 4 a c the lowest levels of h2o2 production belonged to full irrigation plants in other words the production and accumulation of h2o2 increased with the occurrence and drought stress severity in agreement with our study elkelish et al 2021 also in a study stated that drought stress increased h2o2 in wheat tragacanth gum significantly affected black cumin h2o2 production in three experiments full irrigation with 1 25 g l tragacanth reduced h2o2 production compared to non foliar application plants however a significant decrease was observed in 2 5 g l in 2021 season with increasing concentrations of tragacanth material application higher than mentioned amounts the production of h2o2 increased significantly so the amount of h2o2 at 5 g l and above was significantly increased in comparison to the non application of tragacanth this increase was not seen in 2020 and 2021 seasons in plants under moderate and severe drought stress foliar application of tragacanth gum up to 7 5 g l decreased the production of h2o2 however at higher concentrations of tragacanth the production of h2o2 again increased but this increase was not significant compared to the non use of tragacanth for plants under moderate stress in severe drought stress 10 g l tragacanth use increased h2o2 production compared to non use in 2020 and 2021 seasons but not in 2018 season fig 4 thus under drought stress foliar application of black cumin via tragacanth gum reduces plant h2o2 production especially at lower concentrations probably tragacanth at lower concentrations decreases plant transpiration by lowering water loss through stomata enhancing the plant s water potential fig 2 and preventing drought and oxidative stress however total closure of stomata at higher concentrations of tragacanth use which may occur depending on the amount of available water at different concentrations reduces the plant s potential and rwc induces drought stress and increases h2o2 production 2 5 7 stability of cell membrane in the present research the interaction of irrigation regimes and the application of different concentrations of tragacanth on cell membrane stability was significant p 0 01 supplementary tables s1 s2 and s3 in this study the highest percentages of cell membrane stability belonged to plants under full irrigation the occurrence of drought stress and its severity reduced the cell membrane stability in plants under full irrigation foliar application of black cumin to the concentration of 1 25 g l in moderate drought stress up to 5 g l of tragacanth gum significantly increased the membrane stability compared to non foliar application however higher concentrations of tragacanth significantly reduced membrane stability so the lowest value was obtained at 10 g l concentration fig 5a c in plants under severe drought stress consumption of tragacanth gum up to 7 5 g l increased membrane stability using 10 g l of tragacanth had no significant difference from 5 and 7 5 g l in 2018 fig 5a but in 2020 and 2021 seasons significantly differed fig 5b and c 2 5 8 leaf chlorophyll content the present study showed that the interaction of irrigation regimes and application of different concentrations of tragacanth on chlorophyll a b and total content was significant p 0 01 supplementary tables s1 s2 and s3 the highest chlorophyll a b and total content were observed in full irrigation treatments drought stress reduced the chlorophyll content of a b and total fig 6a c in the 2018 season of experiment the full irrigation treatment had the highest chlorophyll a b and total content at 1 25 g l of tragacanth gum this substance decreased leaf chlorophylls a b and total at 55 g l and above concentrations in moderate and severe drought stressed plants 10 g l tragacanth reduced chlorophyll content fig 6a the highest chlorophyll a b and total content were obtained at a 2 5 g l concentration of tragacanth gum for 2020 and 2021 seasons under full irrigation treatment consumption of higher concentrations of this substance reduced the chlorophyll content of the leaf so that the chlorophyll content at a concentration of 10 g l tragacanth gum has been reduced to lower levels in comparison to the chlorophyll content in plants under moderate and severe drought stress fig 6b and c in 70 and 40 fc irrigation levels applying tragacanth gum up to 5 g l and 7 5 g l respectively increased the chlorophyll content compared to the control in three experiments consumption of more than 5 g l for 70 fc and 7 5 g l for 40 fc reduced the content of chlorophylls a b and total in three seasons so that in the use of 10 g l of tragacanth the reduction of chlorophyll content significantly decreased compared to control fig 6a c 2 5 9 photochemical efficiency of photosystem ii the interaction of irrigation regimes and the application of tragacanth at different concentrations was significant p 0 01 on photosystem ii efficiency supplementary tables s1 s2 and s3 changes in the traits chlorophyll content and photochemical efficiency of photosystem ii of black cumin plants at different irrigation levels and with various concentrations of tragacanth extract had almost the same trend in all three seasons the three experiments revealed that plants under full irrigation in 2018 had the highest photochemical efficiency of photosystem ii in 0 1 25 and 2 5 g l of tragacanth gum foliar application treatments in the 2020 and 2021 experiments all tragacanth concentrations were superior fig 7a c plants under severe drought stress showed the lowest photochemical efficiency of photosystem ii in our study the mean comparison of data results showed that the foliar application of plants affected the photochemical efficiency of photosystem ii in different irrigation regimes the concentration of 1 25 g l for 2018 and 2 5 g l for 2020 and 2021 seasons had the maximum photochemical efficiency of photosystem ii in the full irrigation treatment the highest photochemical efficiency of photosystem ii was found in three experiments using tragacanth gum concentrations of 5 g l for 70 irrigation and 7 5 g l for 40 irrigation the decrease in this trait was significant only in the high concentrations 10 g l of the application of tragacanth extract in full irrigation fig 7 2 5 10 grain weight in the present study the interaction of irrigation regimes and the application of different concentrations of tragacanth on grain weight was significant p 0 01 supplementary tables s1 s2 and s3 the results showed that drought stress caused a significant decrease in grain weight in three seasons so the lowest grain weight belonged to plants under severe drought stress especially in tragacanth non consumption treatment fig 8a c in 2018 season the mean grain weight of foliar application plants with 1 25 4 34 g 10 plants 2 5 g l 4 23 g 10 plants and non foliar 4 24 g plants tragacanth were not significantly different in full irrigation treatment for these three concentrations in the 2020 season 1 25 g l and in the 2021 season 2 5 g l concentrations vary from non use at this irrigation level the grain weight of plants using more than 2 5 g l tragacanth gum decreased significantly compared to control plants foliar application enhanced grain weight under drought stress conditions tragacanth gum foliar application significantly increased grain weight in moderate drought stressed plants at 5 g l of tragacanth consumption the greatest grain weight was 3 94 4 and 3 91 g 10 plants in 2018 2020 and 2021 seasons plant foliar treatment with this concentration of tragacanth increased grain weight by 11 6 8 1 and 15 compared to the control without tragacanth consumption for 2018 2020 and 2021 seasons respectively in full irrigation the grain weight was equal to the trait at the same concentration in severe drought stress tragacanth up to 7 5 g l enhanced grain weight while 10 g l reduced it however there was no significant difference with non foliar application conditions in the 2018 and 2021 seasons of experiments but it was significant in the 2020 season fig 8a c 2 5 11 water use efficiency wue the interaction between irrigation regimes and the application of different concentrations of tragacanth on wue was significant p 0 01 supplementary tables s1 s2 and s3 in the present study under non foliar application conditions the wue was 17 8 15 52 and 10 38 for plants under full irrigation moderate and severe 2018 season and 19 7 18 1 and 11 4 2020 season and 19 16 1 and 11 1 for 2021 season for moderate and severe drought stress respectively fig 9a c in other words the occurrence and increase of drought stress caused a decrease in wue in full irrigation treatment tragacanth gum concentrations up to 1 25 g l in 2018 and l in 2020 and 2021 seasons enhanced wue using tragacanth gum with concentrations higher significantly decreased the wue in black cumin additionally in the first experiment tragacanth with a concentration of 10 g l resulted in approximately an equivalent percentage of wue of the plants under full irrigation and severe drought stress in the two other experiments tragacanth with a concentration of 10 g l resulted in approximately an equivalent percentage of wue of the plants under full irrigation and moderate drought stress our findings revealed that the foliar application of the plants under drought stress conditions with tragacanth extract increased wue in 2018 season irrigation treatments with 70 fc and 5 g l tragacanth gum consumption had the greatest wue 20 3 it was different from other foliar application treatments at the same irrigation level fig 9a in three years increasing tragacanth consumption by up to 5 g l and up to 7 5 g l in plants under moderate and severe drought stress increased wue compared to non foliar application conditions however higher concentrations of tragacanth reduced wue fig 9a c under severe drought stress conditions the concentration of 10 g l was placed in the same statistical group as the control plants for the 2018 and 2021 seasons of the experiment fig 9a c in general tragacanth gum foliar application on black cumin enhanced wue the plant s response to tragacanth concentration increase varied by irrigation levels it continued in drought stressed plants until a high concentration of tragacanth consumption tragacanth gum may affect the numerator grain weight and the denominator water use of the wue equation in full irrigation conditions tragacanth extract concentrations of 1 25 g l 2018 season and 2 5 g l 2020 and 2021 seasons increased wue by increasing grain weight although water usage was sometimes enhanced the foliar application significantly affected grain weight equation numerator under moderate drought stress fig 8a c in severe drought stress conditions the wue changes were due to the effects of foliar application on the numerator and denominator of the wue equation 2 5 12 correlation among traits the results showed that the correlation between the rwc of leaf and cell membrane stability total chlorophyll content and photochemical efficiency of photosystem ii was completely positive and significant p 0 001 fig 10a c there was a negative and significant correlation between rwc and h2o2 content p 0 001 fig 10d these results indicate that the presence of sufficient water in the plant caused a decrease in the production and accumulation of h2o2 and consequently increased cell membrane stability and consequently increased total chlorophyll content and photochemical efficiency of photosystem ii fig 10 e g shows the negative correlation between the amount of h2o2 with cell membrane stability total chlorophyll content and photochemical efficiency of photosystem ii and the positive correlation between cell membrane stability with total chlorophyll content fig 10h and photochemical efficiency of photosystem ii fig 10i in the present experiment there was a positive and significant correlation between the photochemical efficiency of photosystem ii and cell membrane stability with the grain weight of black cumin fig 10k and l 2 6 discussion traditionally agricultural research has focused primarily on maximizing total production abdallah et al 2018 drought stress is one of the most important factors which is a serious obstacle to increasing crop yield naderi et al 2020 today climate changes have led to a decrease in rainfall and an increase in temperature especially in arid and semi arid regions kim et al 2020 mansour et al 2021 soil moisture is affected by the amount of water entering the soil irrigation or rainfall soil moisture content determines plant access to water and its water status in the present study the pots weight decreased because of reduced soil entering water due to drought stress treatments fig 1 anti transpirant materials have been defined as chemical materials capable of reducing the transpiration rate when applied to the plant canopy glenn et al 2003 the most obvious use of anti transpirant is conserving soil water by reducing plant consumption thus reducing irrigation frequency del amor and rubio 2009 abdallah et al 2018 because nearly 95 99 of absorbed water from the soil by plant roots is transpired there is a high potential for water saving through reducing transpiration del amor and rubio 2009 boari et al 2014 foliar application of tragacanth gum on the plant reduced transpiration and consequently the amount of water consumed by the plant in different irrigation regimes it increased the pots weight fig 1 similar to this study abdullah et al 2015 in the investigation of the effect of anti transpirant agents on the weight of experimental pots reported that the use of anti transpirant agents increased the weight of the pots compared to the control treatment changes in osmotic and pressure potential in plants are influenced by various factors that determine the amount of osmotic potential and plant water status the main reason for the decrease in osmotic potential more negative in water deficit conditions is the accumulation of a series of osmotic compounds such as proline and soluble sugars najafi vafa et al 2022 the increase in osmotic compounds in the cell causes the cell turgor pressure ψp to recover and the osmotic potential ψs to decrease which is a known biochemical mechanism that enables plants to sustain water uptake blum 2017 these soluble substances also protect macromolecules cell organelles and structures such as chloroplasts from stress poudel et al 2021 also in the present study drought stress and its increasing intensity significantly reduced the plant s osmotic potential and leaf water potential more negative in three seasons fig 2 in addition water deficit significantly reduced leaf pressure potential fig 2 our results illustrated that under various irrigation regimes tragacanth gum application levels affected leaf osmotic potential differently in general in the three seasons of the experiment the low tragacanth concentrations reduced the osmotic potential less negative and increased the pressure potential its higher concentrations depending on irrigation treatments resulted in a more negative osmotic potential and a lower pressure potential in the plant fig 2 the maintenance of higher turgor pressure of leaves of plants sprayed with anti transpirant under water deficit conditions is because the anti transpirant materials reduce water loss and enable long term turgor maintenance under water deficit conditions del amor et al 2010 moreover the plant s water potential increased less negative with tragacanth extract application under different irrigation regimes this is due to the positive effects of tragacanth foliar application on decreasing osmotic potential and increasing pressure potential in plants fig 2 drought stress causes a series of serious biochemical and physiological disorders such as reduction of stomatal conductance and reduction of leaf water content makhlouf et al 2022 similarly in our study drought stress treatments led to the lowest leaf rwc in all tragacanth concentrations fig 3 the leaf rwc is a criterion of drought resistance in drought stress conditions the leaf rwc decreases due to reducing the leaf water potential and decreasing water absorption from the roots bahavar et al 2009 kabiri et al 2014 foliar application of black cumin with tragacanth may increase leaf rwc by reducing stomatal water loss closure of the stomata the complete and continuous blocking of the stomata and the plant s inability to absorb water from the soil at the high tragacanth gum concentrations may also lower leaf rwc we found leaf rwc is directly related to cellular turgor and plant water potential fig 2 cellular turgor directly affects cell growth and division thus there is a close relationship between the leaf rwc and the biological function of the plant yadav and bhushan 2001 in drought stress there will be a limited amount of nadp for electron acceptance so oxygen can act as an electron receptor acar et al 2001 so that the electrons leaked from the electron transfer chains can react with o2 during the normal metabolism of the plant yan et al 2006 this leads to the accumulation of toxic oxygen species such as radicals of superoxide o₂ hydrogen peroxide h₂o₂ and hydroxyl ohˉ also in drought stress conditions due to the limited absorption and stabilization of co2 and increased activity of the oxygenase of the rubisco enzyme photorespiration increases in c3 plants which will also lead to an increase in h2o2 miller et al 2010 many researchers have linked 70 of h2o2 produced during drought stress to photorespiration noctor et al 2002 cruz 2008 our findings corroborate the above mentioned studies fig 4 tragacanth gum significantly affected black cumin h2o2 production under drought stress foliar application of black cumin via tragacanth gum reduces plant h2o2 production especially at lower concentrations fig 4 probably tragacanth at lower concentrations decreases plant transpiration by lowering water loss through stomata enhancing the plant s water potential fig 2 and preventing drought and oxidative stress however total closure of stomata at higher concentrations of tragacanth use which may occur depending on the amount of available water at different concentrations reduces the plant s potential and rwc figs 2 and 3 induces drought stress and increases h2o2 production the occurrence of drought stress and its severity reduced cell membrane stability one of the important consequences of drought stress is oxidative stress and the production of ros tiryaki 2016 ros that are produced during stress cause damage to many cellular compositions such as lipids proteins carbohydrates and nucleic acids as a result it causes lipid peroxidation and damage cell membranes acar et al 2001 yan et al 2006 ehrenbergerova et al 2009 naliwajski and skłodowska 2021 in the present study membrane stability decreased due to lipid peroxidation of the membrane with increasing production and accumulation of ross such as h2o2 fig 4 during drought stress the highest percentage of cell membrane stability was observed in treatments with the lowest amount of h2o2 accumulation figs 4 and 5 in addition in the present study changes in cell membrane stability under different treatments were mainly similar to changes in leaf rwc content figs 3 and 5 terfore there is a positive correlation between rwc and cell membrane stability fig 10a similar to the results of our study fig 5 kabiri et al 2014 reported that drought stress reduced the rwc of the leaf and increased the damage to the membrane in addition in our study under full irrigation and moderate and severe stress respectively the effective concentration of tragacanth gum for improving cell membrane stability and chlorophyll content was increased in contrast higher concentrations of tragacanth under full irrigation and moderate drought stress were significantly reduced in terms of membrane stability as well as chlorophyll content under all irrigation treatments figs 5 and 6 one of the effects of drought stress on plants is the reduction of chlorophyll content najafi vafa et al 2022 in the present study drought stress reduced the chlorophyll content of a b and total fig 6 a number of studies confirm our findings zaki and radwan 2011 kabiri et al 2014 haj seyed hadi et al 2016 that drought stress negatively affects plant chlorophyll content they have attributed the reduction of chlorophyll content under drought stress conditions to the reduction of membrane stability gnaana saraswathi and paliwal 2011 as stated drought stress caused an increase in the production of h2o2 in the leaf by decreasing the rwc figs 3 and 4 the ros reduces photosynthesis plant growth and yield by oxidizing lipids in biological membranes damaging chloroplast structure and reduction of photosynthetic pigment content in plants anjum et al 2017 increasing h2o2 in turn will increase chlorophyll decomposition ying et al 2015 and this shows a negative correlation between h2o2 and chlorophyll amount fig 10f the reduction of chlorophyll concentration results in non stomatal limitations of photosynthesis under drought stress conditions thus chlorophyll content helps to maintain photosynthesis under drought stress shimakawa and miyake 2018 the effects of foliar application tragacanth gum and its various concentrations on the chlorophyll content of the plant in different irrigation regimes almost completely followed the effects of this substance on the potential and rwc of the leaf figs 2 and 3 production and accumulation of h2o2 fig 4 and the percentage of cell membrane stability fig 5 therefore every increase in the leaf s potential and rwc decreased the generation and accumulation of h2o2 and increased cell membrane stability and chlorophyll content in the plant consequently chlorophyll a b and total content decreased or increased similary yang et al 2018 stated that the use of anti transpirant agents increased the content of chlorophyll by increasing the rwc of the leaf it was almost the same trend in all three seasons for changes in chlorophyll content and photochemical efficiency of photosystem ii in black cumin plants treated with different levels of irrigation and concentrations of tragacanth extract in general the water deficit decreased photosystem ii s photochemical efficiency fig 7 photosynthesis is fundamental to the growth and in turn must continue under stress the decrease in chlorophyll concentration during drought stress is one of the key causes of reduced photosynthesis prakash and ramachandran 2000 which is also shown in the present study drought stress affects photosynthesis efficiency by changing the osmotic potential and the degree of stomata opening and closing yousefi et al 2020 reducing leaf rwc reduces photosynthesis and co2 processing lawlor and cornic 2002 drought stress also affects plant metabolism and destroys proteins and enzymes including photosynthetic enzymes ghani et al 2000 it has been reported that the reduction of photosynthesis under severe drought stress is due to the reduction in photosystem ii efficiency xu and zhou 2005 the decrease in co2 assimilation due to stomatal closure under drought stress may result in the non consumption of electron transfer chain products nadph and atp and an increase in decreased ferredoxin amount by increasing reduced ferredoxin the production of active radicals may be increased and the alteration or degradation of the thylakoid membrane proteins may occur therefore the destruction of thylakoid membrane proteins prevents electron transfer from the photosystem ii acceptor this object reduces the electron transfer rate increases chlorophyll fluorescence and reduces photosystem ii performance piper et al 2007 tilahun and sven 2003 also due to increased chlorophyll fluorescence under drought stress conditions photosystem ii activity is altered and the protein d1 structure is destroyed ahmed et al 2002 researchers have found that drought stress degrades the oxygen releasing complex and the d1 protein of the photosystem ii reaction centers zlatev and yordanov 2004 reducing the electron transfer rate and the quantum yield of photosystem ii under drought stress may be due to the destruction of the calvin cycle the delay in quinone regeneration and the destruction of the thylakoid membrane electron transport chain tilahun and sven 2003 the fv fm ratio reduction under drought stress indicates electron transfer from photosystem ii to photosystem i has been reduced lu zhang 1998 our acquired results fig 7 are validated by these studies our results revealed that the foliar application of plants affected the photochemical efficiency of photosystem ii in different irrigation regimes such as other studied traits the effects of tragacanth at various concentrations and levels of irrigation suggest that its application as an anti transpirant agent ultimately depends on the plant s water status these results agree with those reported by abdullah et al 2015 they reported that applying an anti transpirant agent increased the photochemical efficiency of photosystem ii without a change in stomatal conductance the increase in photochemical efficiency of photosystem ii due to tragacanth gum application can be attributed to an increase in the cuticle thickness of the leaf a decrease in water loss and a consequent increase in leaf rwc and water status fig 3 although the plant is in good condition regarding access to water decrease in the plant s photochemical efficiency of photosystem ii at high concentrations seems to be due to the effect of tragacanth gum application on reducing stomatal conductance and plant gas exchange for the photosynthesis process the stomata perform two processes together one is water removal and the other is carbon dioxide absorption due to stomata openings carbon dioxide s initial absorption is associated with water s outflow therefore the lower the outflow of water at high levels of anti transpirant compounds the amount of carbon dioxide is lower brillante et al 2016 the use of anti transpirant compounds under optimal irrigation conditions reduces plant growth and photosynthesis processes due to the adverse effect of these compounds on entering and exiting gases in the plant brillante et al 2016 which is consistent with the results of the present research photosynthesis growth and plant yield are among the physiological factors that drought stress affects chaves et al 2002 xiang et al 2021 xiang et al 2022 the research results indicate that plants are often less likely to grow when exposed to environmental stress because in this condition they allocate existing photoassimilates to increase the synthesis of secondary metabolites terpene compounds to survive in severe environmental conditions bettaieb et al 2009 rebey et al 2012 during experiments we found that drought stress reduced the potential and content of leaf water figs 2 and 3 and increased the production of h2o2 fig 4 thereby negatively affecting cell membrane stability there was a decrease in chlorophyll content fig 6 and the photosystem ii s photochemical efficiency fig 7 as a result drought stress can adversely affect source reservoir relationships during the growth stage resulting in a significant loss of grain weight pessarkli 1999 other researchers have also reported reduced black cumin yield during drought stress rezaei chiyaneh et al 2018 haj seyed hadi et al 2016 in agreement with the obviously obtained results and the above mentioned cases our study showed that drought stress caused a significant decrease in grain weight in three seasons so the lowest grain weight belonged to plants under severe drought stress especially in tragacanth non consumption treatment fig 8 the effects of different concentrations of tragacanth gum application on the above mentioned traits are finally manifested in the grain yield at full irrigation level the grain weight of plants with more than 2 5 g l tragacanth gum decreased significantly compared to control plants in moderate drought stressed plants high concentration 10 g l of tragacanth gum foliar application significantly decreased grain weight foliar application enhanced grain weight under severe drought stress conditions fig 8 in order to justify the effects of foliar application of tragacanth on grain weight in different irrigation regimes it can be stated that grain weight is significantly affected by the effects of different concentrations of tragacanth consumption on the traits such as water potential and leaf rwc figs 2 and 3 the production of h2o2 fig 4 cell membrane stability fig 5 chlorophyll content fig 6 and the photochemical efficiency of the photosystem ii fig 7 the trend of changes in grain weight in different irrigation regimes and under the influence of foliar application with various concentrations of tragacanth gum follows the variation trend of these traits in the mentioned conditions the results demonstrate a positive correlation between rwc and grain yield fig 10j due to the positive effects of plant rwc on the reduction of h2o2 content improvement of cell membrane stability an increase in chlorophyll content and photochemical efficiency of photosystem ii an improvement in photosynthesis in the plant and consequently an increase in grain weight fig 10 any factor that improves the water status of the plant can increase the plant s production capacity and yield by the effect of the parameters mentioned our findings agree with yang et al 2018 studies which showed the use of anti transpiration agents increased grain weight in maize plants due to the increasing rwc of the leaf chlorophyll content and photosynthesis without a change in stomatal conductance understanding the relationship between wue and plant yield in areas exposed to drought stress is very important in recent years the focus has shifted to maximizing wue rather than yield savic et al 2011 there is a high potential for saving water by reducing transpiration since 95 99 of soil absorbed water by plant roots is transpired boari et al 2014 the use of anti transpiration agents is one of the management methods for achieving maximum wue in regions with insufficient water or when there is end of season drought stress abdullah et al 2015 abdallah et al 2019b drought stress decreases plant wue fig 9 in general our findings illustrated that the foliar application of tragacanth gum to the black cumin plant enhanced wue the plant s response to a higher concentration of tragacanth varied with irrigation levels it continued under drought stress especially severe drought stress until a high concentration of tragacanth consumption was reached fig 9 in other words foliar application with tragacanth gum increased wue to high concentrations by increasing grain weight and reducing black cumin s water usage fig 8 and 9 these effects suggest tragacanth gum s anti transpiration properties in a study by abdallah et al 2018 it was shown that anti transpiration agents increased photosynthesis without increasing stomatal conductance the positive effect of tragacanth on improving the wue of plants under full irrigation was attributed to the low concentration of this material under full irrigation conditions there is no limit to the transpiration and photosynthesis of the plant the application of tragacanth acts like an anti transpiration agent and affects transpiration and stomatal conductance in the plant in the present study the application of high concentrations of tragacanth gum reduced the rwc of leaves fig 3 and caused drought stress in the plant figs 4 5 6 and 7 in fact higher concentrations of tragacanth cause more stomata to be close to the point where in addition to transpiration photosynthesis and substance formation in the plant are also greatly reduced and this means a decrease in dry matter production fig 8 the dry matter produced is the numerator of the fraction in the water use efficiency wue formula therefore the greater reduction of the numerator of the fraction compared to the denominator of the fraction of the wue equation led to a decrease in the wue value at higher concentrations of tragacanth gum application by spraying anti transpirant substances on pepper plant leaves the amount of transpiration and stomatal conductance decreased del amor et al 2010 in the present experiment different traits from year to year were affected by several factors including soil texture and weather conditions on the one hand the pot soil type and texture for 2018 were different from the soil used for 2020 and 2021 seasons the variation in water holding capacity in these soils caused differences in soil water content and in this way we determined the effect of soil texture on the effects of various irrigation treatments and application levels of tragacanth extract on different traits on the other hand temperature values during the growing season varied over three seasons in addition to the cases mentioned above natural sunlight was used to illuminate the greenhouse this naturally changes from year to year examining these differences over three seasons allowed us to evaluate the effectiveness of various concentrations of tragacanth gum under various weather conditions adjusted within the ranges mentioned in materials and methods it also helped us describe more confidently the effects of tragacanth gum as a novel antiperspirant furthermore it helped us conclude that tragacanth gum cannot be recommended under all conditions at a specific concentration choosing the appropriate concentration for this substance depends on soil texture weather conditions and the amount of water available to the plant 2 7 conclusion the results of this study indicated the different effects of various concentrations of tragacanth material in different irrigation levels on the studied traits of black cumin the trend of changes in physiological and biochemical traits of black cumin plants under varying irrigation levels and tragacanth extract concentrations was practically the same in all three seasons however experimental conditions may have caused some differences between three seasons results our findings showed that tragacanth gum concentrations depended on the plant s water state so using higher concentrations of tragacanth gum in drought stress conditions had a more positive effect on the plant and vice versa using a lower concentration of this material was helpful in full irrigation the results of experiments showed that the application of this material has been effective in improving water status increasing wue in black cumin decreasing production and accumulation of h2o2 reducing destructive effects caused by ros increasing the membrane stability increasing the plant chlorophyll content improving photochemical efficiency of photosystem ii and consequently improving grain weight also applying the proper concentration of the tragacanth material could significantly increase grain weight in moderate and severe drought stress conditions compared to non foliar application conditions therefore in most years tragacanth gum can be introduced and used as an anti transpiration matter in areas exposed to drought stress at the end of the season which requires further research additionally if it is used as an anti transpiration agent its concentration must be determined for each plant considering the severity of drought stress in the area declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

8854,improving water productivity with the aim of more production and less water use is considered one effective strategic option for managing irrigation under water deficit conditions in order to investigate the effect of irrigation regimes and application of different concentrations of tragacanth gum on the black cumin plant a factorial experiment was conducted based on a completely randomized design with three replications in a greenhouse of the agriculture faculty of kurdistan university in kurdistan in 2018 2020 and 2021 seasons the experimental factors included irrigation at

rwc cell membrane stability chlorophyll content the efficiency of photosystem ii grain weight and water use efficiency wue and increased the amount of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 the results showed that the effect of various concentrations of application of tragacanth in different levels of irrigation was different considering the effect of proper concentration of this material on the improvement of measured traits and increasing the grain weight compared to non application of tragacanth under moderate and severe drought stress conditions by 11 6 and 28 2 2018 8 1 and 33 9 2020 15 and 27 7 2021

s life cycle jansen and potters 2017 climate change is one of the major environmental problems that humanity has faced in the past two decades abbass et al 2022 shayanmehr et al 2022 continuous droughts and increased heat flux that have emerged or intensified due to these climatic changes cause plenty of problems for the production of plant products in the future vicente serrano et al 2014 medrano et al 2015 non biological stresses such as heat and drought are the most important environmental factors that often reduce growth and crop yield sita et al 2017 in addition to reducing vegetative growth and altering the anatomical structures of the plant drought stress changes the pathways used to synthesize secondary chemicals and metabolites by inducing secondary stress such as oxidative stress sharma et al 2012 many studies have reported the accumulation of reactive oxygen species ros and its damage during drought stress miller et al 2010 hasanuzzaman et al 2014 in droughts damage to the photosystem ii inhibits other components of the electron transport chain thereby reducing photosynthetic electron transfer leading to a loss of a significant percentage of the absorbed light energy in the form of heat and fluorescence wang et al 2018 the use of anti transpirant agents effectively reduces the effects of drought stress on plants and adjustment the reduction of the yield due to water deficiency in arid and semi arid regions dass and bhattacharyya 2017 morsy and mehanna 2022 in fact anti transpirant materials prevent the reduction of plant yield by decreasing transpiration and increasing water use efficiency abdullah et al 2015 abdallah et al 2019a research has shown that anti transpirant coatings reduce transpiration and maintain plant water as well as reduce the permeability of leaves to co2 exchange and thus reduce photosynthesis lipe and skinner 1979 however recent studies have shown that the ability to control water in the plant improves drought tolerance in the plant bramley et al 2013 according to abdullah et al 2015 there was an increase in photosynthesis due to anti transpirant agents during drought stress contrary to bistgani et al 2017 and dass and bhattacharyya 2017 hypotheses that anti transpirant agents always harm carbon dioxide exchange this indicates a relative improvement in plant water status and leaf pressure probably due to the soil s moisture storage abdullah et al 2015 therefore the relative improvement in plant water status and leaf pressure may result in carbon dioxide stabilization in durum wheat araus et al 1993 tambussi et al 2005 research results have shown that using anti transpirant agents before the flowering stage reduces grain sterility in wheat kettlewell et al 2010 abdullah et al 2015 there has been much research on the effects of anti transpirant agents on various products such as wheat kettlewell et al 2010 kettlewell 2014 basil malekpoor et al 2016 thyme bistgani et al 2017 soybean dass and bhattacharyya 2017 and bell pepper del amor et al 2010 however no studies have been done on the effect of anti transpirant agents on black cumin nigella sativa black cumin is a one year old plant belonging to southwest asia which has many industrial and medicinal uses kabiri et al 2014 espanany et al 2016 black cumin has been used in traditional iranian medicine nickavar et al 2003 although past research has shown that black cumin is resistant to water deficiency bannayan et al 2008 drought stress is an environmental factor that reduces the yield of black cumin rezaei chiyaneh et al 2018 which may be due to the sensitivity of the plant to water deficiency at flowering stage in the mediterranean regions drought stress is inevitable and reduces the growth and yield of plants including black cumin haj seyed hadi et al 2016 establishing a balance between the amount of water consumed by the plant and the amount of available water is a fundamental objective in the agricultural sector especially in arid and semi arid regions where water is a limiting factor for plant growth kang et al 2009 yi et al 2022 researchers have always been looking at ways to reduce the loss of water from the transpiration of aerial plant organs and increase water use efficiency this subject becomes more important when plants are considered water spenders abdallah et al 2018 morsy and mehanna 2022 because the amount of water consumed by plants for photosynthesis is less than 5 of the plant s total water use and the remainder is emitted by the transpiration from the plant dawson et al 1996 prakash and ramachandran 2000 in fact transpiration is a necessary process for photosynthesis and depending on the conditions may be harmful in some cases so the use of anti transpirant is one of the most effective methods for reducing the amount of water lost through transpiration abdullah et al 2015 abdallah et al 2019a some anti transpirant materials with certain biological activities reduce the plant s transpiration rate it also improves the damaging effects of drought stress on plants due to increased leaf resistance to water loss moftah 1997 based on the method of action anti transpirant compounds are divided into three groups anti transpirant coating compounds cover the surface of the leaf completely block the stomata and prevent water from leaving the surface of the leaves effulgent anti transpirant compounds increase shine and reflection of sunlight and reduce the absorption of heat energy and stomata blocker anti transpirant compounds close stomata by stimulating some physiological processes abdallah et al 2019a generally the anti transpirant coatings the emulsion from wax latex or plastic are sprayed on the foliage and reduce stomatal conduction abdallah et al 2018 tragacanth is a natural gum and anionic polysaccharide that is secreted from asian species of astraglus gummifer plant tragacanth plant is found with a height of 0 1 1 m in the height and desert regions of iran turkey iraq syria lebanon afghanistan pakistan and russia different species of tragacanth plants are dispersed in most parts of iran especially in the central area to the west and in the zagros mountainous regions iran is the world s largest tragacanth producer and iranian tragacanth has the highest quality among tragacanths produced in neighboring countries verbeken et al 2014 tragacanth is both stabilizer and reduces surface tension it has long been widely used in the food pharmaceutical cosmetics textile and medical industries tavakol and mohammadifar 2017 in addition to reducing surface tension tragacanth can act as a thickener and these two properties have increased the use of this material in the food pharmaceutical and cosmetics industries gavlighi et al 2013 supplying the food need of the growing population of the world requires increased production and yield per unit area therefore improving crop yield under drought stress is the goal of agricultural researchers worldwide manavalan and nguyen 2017 climate change created in the world and the intensification of stresses caused by it especially drought stress in arid and semi arid regions such as iran make it challenging to achieve this goal shayanmehr et al 2022 therefore finding strategies that can reduce the effects of water shortages on plants and improve their growth and yield can be very worthwhile given the coating properties of tragacanth gel the idea came to the mind of the authors of this paper that this substance could be used as an anti transpirant coating to reduce water loss through transpiration without reducing plant growth and yield in order to determine if there is a positive impact on plant growth and yield under water deficiency conditions tragacanth is introduced for the first time as a new anti transpirant substance of organic origin and presented to the world of agriculture the study s objective was to investigate the effect of foliar application of different doses of tragacanth on the aqueous relations of plants physiological characteristics and black cumin grain weight under different irrigation regimes 2 materials and methods 2 1 experiment conditions and treatments this research was carried out in a factorial experiment with a completely randomized design with three replications the experiments took place in a greenhouse at the agriculture college of kurdistan university from may 31 to september 1 in 2018 and may 31 to september 11 in 2020 and 2021 the experimental factors included irrigation at three levels of 100 full irrigation 70 moderate drought stress and 40 severe drought stress of fc of soil and foliar application with tragacanth gum at six concentrations of 0 1 25 2 5 5 7 5 and 10 g l during the experiment the minimum and maximum greenhouse temperatures were 18 and 33 c respectively and the relative humidity was 47 natural sunlight was used to provide the necessary lighting and once the greenhouse s umbrella was installed the average light intensity ranged between 400 and 600 µmol m2 s first plastic pots 30 in diameter and 30 cm in height 706 5 cm area and 450 g in weight were filled with 11 316 g in 2018 and 11 000 g in 2020 and 2021 seasons of soil table 1 in 2018 each pot reached the fc with 1734 g of water the weight of pots in fc and permanent wilting point pwp was 13 500 g and 12 300 g respectively in 2020 and 2021 seasons each pot reached the fc with 2350 g of water the weight of pots in fc and pwp was 13 800 g and 12 800 g respectively before planting according to soil analysis 25 kg of nitrogen per hectare of urea source 50 kg ha of potassium k2o and 70 kg ha of phosphorus p2o5 were added to the soil in each pot 14 seeds of black cumin 200 plants per square meter were cultivated at first 20 seeds were planted in each pot and after germination and ensuring the establishment of the plant four leaf stage 14 plants were kept in each pot one replication including 18 planted pots was used for destructive sampling irrigation treatments were applied one week before flowering floral bud appearance stage and continued for 40 days 9 stages and up to 10 days before harvest physiological maturity browning of 75 of capsules prior to applying irrigation treatments irrigation was entirely performed for all treatments every five days all the pots reached the fc the pots were shifted during each watering operation to reduce or altogether remove the error caused by the pots original position in the greenhouse the weighing method determined the time of irrigation treatments percentage of fc in pots irrigation was carried out at intervals of 5 days in each irrigation event the weight of the pot under full irrigation and without foliar application with tragacanth was the criterion after five days the amount of water needed to reach the fc was determined and consumed for 40 and 70 of irrigation treatments 40 and 70 of the water required for full irrigation treatment were used in pots where their required water was less than water consumed in full irrigation without foliar application excess water was calculated as stored water to be considered in calculating the water use efficiency at the same time as applying irrigation treatments tragacanth extract was sprayed at the beginning of budding for this purpose weighed tragacanth values from the rangelands of kurdistan province a gummifer were dissolved in 1 liter of tepid water after 24 h mixed with a mixer for 5 min to be completely uniform this material was sprayed using a back sprayer shark model with a constant pressure of 2 4 bar and 250 liters of water per hectare when the foliar application a nylon curtain was placed between the pots to prevent the substance from splashing into the other pots 2 2 features of tragacanth tragacanth is a good quality hydrocolloid that is a non uniform and highly branched hydrophilic carbohydrate in terms of chemical composition tragacanth consists of two main components called tragacantic acid or basourin and tragacanthin basourin accounts for 60 70 of total gum and is a water insoluble component that can swell and form a gel the other component tragacanthin is dissolved in water and forms a colloidal solution basourin is an acidic component that produces sugars such as d xylose l fucose d galacturonic acid and a small amount of l rhamnose through acid hydrolysis the acid component of this molecule is also related to cations of calcium magnesium and potassium properties of tragacanth gum are related mainly to basourin tragacanthin is considered a neutral polysaccharide component that consists of sequential d galactose units and the branched chains of l arabinose are jointed to it there are significant amounts of methoxyl groups in its structure tavakol and mohammadifar 2017 2 3 studied characteristics all characteristics were measured 15 days after the application of the treatments at the beginning of the capsule formation the leaf water potential and the efficiency of the photosystems ii of the youngest fully developed leaves in the greenhouse were measured in order to study the relative water content of leaf and electrolyte leakage the parameters were measured after separating the youngest developed leaves of each pot to measure the parameters such as osmotic potential chlorophyll content and hydrogen peroxide content after sampling the youngest leaves developed in each pot the leaves were wrapped in aluminum foil and transferred to the laboratory in a liquid nitrogen tank the samples were kept in a freezer 40 c until analysis finally harvest was carried out at the ripening stage approximately 93 days after sowing in 2018 and 103 days after sowing in the 2020 and 2021 seasons and grain weight and water use efficiency were calculated 2 3 1 the relative water content rwc of leaf the samples were prepared from the leaves of all experimental pots and the samples fresh weight fwt was determined leaf pieces weighing 0 5 g were placed in distilled water separately for four hours under dark conditions after this period the samples were weighed again and the turgidity weights were measured twt the samples were then placed in an oven for 24 h at 70 c and each sample s dry weight dwt was measured jeon et al 2006 1 rwc fwt dwt twt dwt 100 2 3 2 leaf water potential the leaf water potential was measured using a pressure bomb pressure chamber skye skpm 1400 uk for this purpose at 9 11 a m the water potential of the youngest leaf of each pot was measured turner 1988 the leaves were cut from the petiole and placed in a special compartment after opening the air pressure as soon as the first drop of water drawn out from the petiole was observed the airflow was cut off and the number read by the machine was recorded in mpa 2 3 3 leaf osmotic potential after sampling the leaves were cut up into little pieces and 0 3 g of each leaf was placed into a sampler tip that a needle had perforated the sampler head was placed inside a microtube to measure the osmotic potential 1 5 ml it was then centrifuged for 20 min at 25 c and 13 500 rpm in fact with this action the leaf extract was entered into the microtube from the sampler tip for reading 1980 μl of distilled water was mixed with 20 μl of the extract and then centrifuged for 10 min at 25 c and 14 000 rpm finally the osmometer read the osmotic potential of 150 μl of the mixture knauer k 7400 germany 2 3 4 leaf pressure potential pressure potential was obtained from the difference between leaf water potential with osmotic potential singh et al 2014 2 ψp ψw ψs ψ w water potential ψ p pressure potential ψ s osmotic or solute potential 2 3 5 measurement of cell membrane stability

photochemical efficiency of photosystem ii all measurements were carried out on the lateral part of the youngest fully developed leaf with distance from the midrib the photosynthesis meter mini ppm 200 300 ears netherlands measured the photochemical efficiency of photosystem ii 2 3 9 grain weight after the black cumin ripened the various pots grain weight was harvested separately and the grain weight was reported for any treatment in grams per plant grain moisture 7 2 3 10 water use efficiency wue in pots where their required water was less than water consumed in full irrigation without foliar application excess water was calculated as stored water to be considered in calculating the water use efficiency the percentage of water use efficiency was determined by dividing the grain weight grams per square meter by the amount of water used liters ratnayaka and kincaid 2005 2 4 statistical analysis before the data were analyzed their normality test was performed using the mini tab software version 19 2 using sas statistical software version 9 4 an anova of the data for each season was carried out independently based on the relevant plan once the data s normality had been confirmed the uniformity test of variance of the collected experimental errors for three seasons was conducted using the bartlett test for the investigated traits considering the non uniform variance of the three seasons experimental errors for all traits the anova was separately performed for each season lsd least significant difference was used to compare the mean of treatments the graphs are drawn using excel software version 16 0 2 5 results 2 5 1 the weight of the pots fig 1 a c shows that with increasing drought stress pots weight decreased so after applying irrigation treatments in all irrigation stages the highest and lowest weights of pots were achieved under full irrigation conditions and severe drought stress respectively the results also indicate that foliar application the plant with tragacanth extract affects the weight of the pots in full irrigation treatment with increasing concentration of tragacanth application the weight of the pots increased so that at concentrations of 5 7 5 and 10 g l water consumption was higher than the need for black cumin for this reason it was recorded as stored water and considered in calculating water use efficiency also in drought stress treatments irrigation of 70 and 40 of fc of soil at higher concentrations of tragacanth application 10 g l the weight of pots was higher foliar application of the tragacanth solution on the plant reduced the plant s transpiration and consequently the amount of water consumed by the plant in different irrigation regimes fig 1 2 5 2 osmotic potential of the leaf the interaction of irrigation regimes and the application of different concentrations of tragacanth on osmotic potential was significant p 0 01 supplementary tables s1 s2 and s3 drought stress enhanced the plant s osmotic potential in three seasons fig 2 in 2018 season irrigation at 70 fc and 2 5 g l of tragacanth gum and full irrigation at 1 25 g l exhibited the lowest osmotic potential 2 a full irrigation and 2 5 and 1 5 g l of tragacanth gum had the lowest osmotic potential in 2020 2b in 2021 season full irrigation with 2 5 1 25 and 5 g l of tragacanth gum application was placed in a statistical group with consumption of 5 and 7 5 g l at 70 of the fc that resulted in the lowest osmotic potential 2 c our results illustrated that in various irrigation regimes tragacanth extract concentrations affected leaf osmotic potential differently in 2018 season in full irrigation and 70 of the fc consumption of tragacanth gum up to 1 25 g l and 2 5 g l respectively reduced osmotic potential and concentrations higher resulted in a more negative osmotic potential of the plant in irrigation at 40 fc raising the tragacanth extract content to 5 g l decreased the osmotic potential the osmotic potential increased at a higher concentration 10 g l which is more negative in full irrigation in the 2020 and 2021 seasons 2 5 g l tragacanth gum reduced osmotic potential however concentrations higher than 2 5 g l increased the negative osmotic potential of the plant tragacanth extracts up to 7 5 g l reduced the osmotic potential in irrigation at 70 and 40 of the fc however the osmotic potential increased at a higher concentration 10 g l which is more negative fig 2b and c fc field capacity 13 500 g for a 13 800 g for b and c 100 0 100 1 25 100 2 5 100 5 100 7 5 and 100 10 100

and pwp permanent wilting point 12 300 g for a 12 800 g for b and c 2 5 3 pressure potential of leaf in three experiment seasons the interaction of irrigation regimes and application of different concentrations of tragacanth on pressure potential was significant p 0 01 supplementary tables s1 s2 and s3 in three seasons of experiments the highest pressure potential was obtained in full irrigation drought stress significantly reduced leaf pressure potential on average according to all foliar treatments leaf pressure potential in moderate and severe stress conditions compared to full irrigation decreased by 49 and 396 for the 2018 season 59 and 350 for the 2020 season and 62 and 384 for the 2021 season respectively fig 2 at all concentrations of tragacanth extract plants under irrigation at 70 and 40 of the fc were ranked after full irrigation according to leaf pressure potential the effect of different concentrations of foliar application of tragacanth on the amount of leaf pressure potential was different in different irrigation regimes in three seasons of the experiment in 100 70 and 40 fc irrigation treatments foliar application of the black cumin up to 2 5 5 and 7 5 g l increased pressure potential and concentrations higher than mentioned amounts for these irrigation levels reduced the pressure potential fig 2 2 5 4 leaf water potential in the present study the water potential of black cumin leaves was influenced by the amount of pressure and osmotic potentials the interaction of irrigation regimes and the application of different concentrations of tragacanth on water potential was significant p 0 01 supplementary tables s1 s2 and s3 fig 2 demonstrates that in all concentrations of tragacanth application full irrigation treatment had the largest leaf water potential while 70 and 40 of irrigation treatments had less drought stress and its increasing intensity significantly reduced leaf water potential more negative so that on average leaf water potential in moderate and severe stress conditions compared to full irrigation decreased by approximately 73 and 260 for the 2018 season 60 and 250 for the 2020 season and 47 and 230 for the 2021 season respectively fig 2 the water potential of black cumin leaves dropped less after foliar application of tragacanth due to its positive effects on decreasing osmotic potential and increasing pressure potential the varying concentrations of foliar tragacanth extract on leaf osmotic and pressure potentials in different irrigation regimes affected leaf water potential the trend of changes in plant water potential at different irrigation levels under different concentrations of tragacanth extract was similar to the process of changes in plant pressure potential under the influence of these treatments the plant s water potential has increased with tragacanth extract in different irrigation regimes tragacanth use up to 2 5 g l under full irrigation 5 g l 2018 season and 7 5 g l 2020 and 2021 seasons under moderate drought stress and 7 5 g l under severe drought stress increases water plant potential at higher concentrations it causes a significant reduction fig 2a c tp 40 tp 70 and tp 100 turgor or pressure potential at three levels of 100 full irrigation 70 moderate drought stress and 40 severe drought stress of fc of soil respectively wp 40 wp 70 and wp 100 water potential at three levels of 100 full irrigation 70 moderate drought stress and 40 severe drought stress of fc of soil respectively and sp 40 sp 70 and sp 100 osmotic potential at three levels of 100 full irrigation 70 moderate drought stress and 40 severe drought stress of fc of soil respectively 2 5 5 the relative water content rwc in three experiments the interaction of irrigation regimes and application of different concentrations of tragacanth on rwc was significant p 0 01 supplementary tables s1 s2 and s3 different irrigation regimes affect leaf rwc in our study full irrigation and severe drought stress treatments led to the highest and lowest leaf rwc in all tragacanth concentrations respectively the results indicated that different concentrations of tragacanth extract had completely different effects in different irrigation regimes in full irrigation and severe drought stress conditions leaf rwc was maximum at 1 25 and 2 5 g l respectively higher concentrations reduced leaf rwc therefore in two irrigation regimes 7 5 and 10 g l concentrations decreased leaf rwc compared to the control without foliar application under severe drought stress the leaf rwc was maximum at 5 g l and significantly decreased at 10 g l fig 3 a c 2 5 6 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 content in the present study the interaction of irrigation regimes and application of different concentrations of tragacanth on h2o2 content was significant p 0 01 supplementary tables s1 s2 and s3 as shown in fig 4 a c the lowest levels of h2o2 production belonged to full irrigation plants in other words the production and accumulation of h2o2 increased with the occurrence and drought stress severity in agreement with our study elkelish et al 2021 also in a study stated that drought stress increased h2o2 in wheat tragacanth gum significantly affected black cumin h2o2 production in three experiments full irrigation with 1 25 g l tragacanth reduced h2o2 production compared to non foliar application plants however a significant decrease was observed in 2 5 g l in 2021 season with increasing concentrations of tragacanth material application higher than mentioned amounts the production of h2o2 increased significantly so the amount of h2o2 at 5 g l and above was significantly increased in comparison to the non application of tragacanth this increase was not seen in 2020 and 2021 seasons in plants under moderate and severe drought stress foliar application of tragacanth gum up to 7 5 g l decreased the production of h2o2 however at higher concentrations of tragacanth the production of h2o2 again increased but this increase was not significant compared to the non use of tragacanth for plants under moderate stress in severe drought stress 10 g l tragacanth use increased h2o2 production compared to non use in 2020 and 2021 seasons but not in 2018 season fig 4 thus under drought stress foliar application of black cumin via tragacanth gum reduces plant h2o2 production especially at lower concentrations probably tragacanth at lower concentrations decreases plant transpiration by lowering water loss through stomata enhancing the plant s water potential fig 2 and preventing drought and oxidative stress however total closure of stomata at higher concentrations of tragacanth use which may occur depending on the amount of available water at different concentrations reduces the plant s potential and rwc induces drought stress and increases h2o2 production 2 5 7 stability of cell membrane in the present research the interaction of irrigation regimes and the application of different concentrations of tragacanth on cell membrane stability was significant p 0 01 supplementary tables s1 s2 and s3 in this study the highest percentages of cell membrane stability belonged to plants under full irrigation the occurrence of drought stress and its severity reduced the cell membrane stability in plants under full irrigation foliar application of black cumin to the concentration of 1 25 g l in moderate drought stress up to 5 g l of tragacanth gum significantly increased the membrane stability compared to non foliar application however higher concentrations of tragacanth significantly reduced membrane stability so the lowest value was obtained at 10 g l concentration fig 5a c in plants under severe drought stress consumption of tragacanth gum up to 7 5 g l increased membrane stability using 10 g l of tragacanth had no significant difference from 5 and 7 5 g l in 2018 fig 5a but in 2020 and 2021 seasons significantly differed fig 5b and c 2 5 8 leaf chlorophyll content the present study showed that the interaction of irrigation regimes and application of different concentrations of tragacanth on chlorophyll a b and total content was significant p 0 01 supplementary tables s1 s2 and s3 the highest chlorophyll a b and total content were observed in full irrigation treatments drought stress reduced the chlorophyll content of a b and total fig 6a c in the 2018 season of experiment the full irrigation treatment had the highest chlorophyll a b and total content at 1 25 g l of tragacanth gum this substance decreased leaf chlorophylls a b and total at 55 g l and above concentrations in moderate and severe drought stressed plants 10 g l tragacanth reduced chlorophyll content fig 6a the highest chlorophyll a b and total content were obtained at a 2 5 g l concentration of tragacanth gum for 2020 and 2021 seasons under full irrigation treatment consumption of higher concentrations of this substance reduced the chlorophyll content of the leaf so that the chlorophyll content at a concentration of 10 g l tragacanth gum has been reduced to lower levels in comparison to the chlorophyll content in plants under moderate and severe drought stress fig 6b and c in 70 and 40 fc irrigation levels applying tragacanth gum up to 5 g l and 7 5 g l respectively increased the chlorophyll content compared to the control in three experiments consumption of more than 5 g l for 70 fc and 7 5 g l for 40 fc reduced the content of chlorophylls a b and total in three seasons so that in the use of 10 g l of tragacanth the reduction of chlorophyll content significantly decreased compared to control fig 6a c 2 5 9 photochemical efficiency of photosystem ii the interaction of irrigation regimes and the application of tragacanth at different concentrations was significant p 0 01 on photosystem ii efficiency supplementary tables s1 s2 and s3 changes in the traits chlorophyll content and photochemical efficiency of photosystem ii of black cumin plants at different irrigation levels and with various concentrations of tragacanth extract had almost the same trend in all three seasons the three experiments revealed that plants under full irrigation in 2018 had the highest photochemical efficiency of photosystem ii in 0 1 25 and 2 5 g l of tragacanth gum foliar application treatments in the 2020 and 2021 experiments all tragacanth concentrations were superior fig 7a c plants under severe drought stress showed the lowest photochemical efficiency of photosystem ii in our study the mean comparison of data results showed that the foliar application of plants affected the photochemical efficiency of photosystem ii in different irrigation regimes the concentration of 1 25 g l for 2018 and 2 5 g l for 2020 and 2021 seasons had the maximum photochemical efficiency of photosystem ii in the full irrigation treatment the highest photochemical efficiency of photosystem ii was found in three experiments using tragacanth gum concentrations of 5 g l for 70 irrigation and 7 5 g l for 40 irrigation the decrease in this trait was significant only in the high concentrations 10 g l of the application of tragacanth extract in full irrigation fig 7 2 5 10 grain weight in the present study the interaction of irrigation regimes and the application of different concentrations of tragacanth on grain weight was significant p 0 01 supplementary tables s1 s2 and s3 the results showed that drought stress caused a significant decrease in grain weight in three seasons so the lowest grain weight belonged to plants under severe drought stress especially in tragacanth non consumption treatment fig 8a c in 2018 season the mean grain weight of foliar application plants with 1 25 4 34 g 10 plants 2 5 g l 4 23 g 10 plants and non foliar 4 24 g plants tragacanth were not significantly different in full irrigation treatment for these three concentrations in the 2020 season 1 25 g l and in the 2021 season 2 5 g l concentrations vary from non use at this irrigation level the grain weight of plants using more than 2 5 g l tragacanth gum decreased significantly compared to control plants foliar application enhanced grain weight under drought stress conditions tragacanth gum foliar application significantly increased grain weight in moderate drought stressed plants at 5 g l of tragacanth consumption the greatest grain weight was 3 94 4 and 3 91 g 10 plants in 2018 2020 and 2021 seasons plant foliar treatment with this concentration of tragacanth increased grain weight by 11 6 8 1 and 15 compared to the control without tragacanth consumption for 2018 2020 and 2021 seasons respectively in full irrigation the grain weight was equal to the trait at the same concentration in severe drought stress tragacanth up to 7 5 g l enhanced grain weight while 10 g l reduced it however there was no significant difference with non foliar application conditions in the 2018 and 2021 seasons of experiments but it was significant in the 2020 season fig 8a c 2 5 11 water use efficiency wue the interaction between irrigation regimes and the application of different concentrations of tragacanth on wue was significant p 0 01 supplementary tables s1 s2 and s3 in the present study under non foliar application conditions the wue was 17 8 15 52 and 10 38 for plants under full irrigation moderate and severe 2018 season and 19 7 18 1 and 11 4 2020 season and 19 16 1 and 11 1 for 2021 season for moderate and severe drought stress respectively fig 9a c in other words the occurrence and increase of drought stress caused a decrease in wue in full irrigation treatment tragacanth gum concentrations up to 1 25 g l in 2018 and l in 2020 and 2021 seasons enhanced wue using tragacanth gum with concentrations higher significantly decreased the wue in black cumin additionally in the first experiment tragacanth with a concentration of 10 g l resulted in approximately an equivalent percentage of wue of the plants under full irrigation and severe drought stress in the two other experiments tragacanth with a concentration of 10 g l resulted in approximately an equivalent percentage of wue of the plants under full irrigation and moderate drought stress our findings revealed that the foliar application of the plants under drought stress conditions with tragacanth extract increased wue in 2018 season irrigation treatments with 70 fc and 5 g l tragacanth gum consumption had the greatest wue 20 3 it was different from other foliar application treatments at the same irrigation level fig 9a in three years increasing tragacanth consumption by up to 5 g l and up to 7 5 g l in plants under moderate and severe drought stress increased wue compared to non foliar application conditions however higher concentrations of tragacanth reduced wue fig 9a c under severe drought stress conditions the concentration of 10 g l was placed in the same statistical group as the control plants for the 2018 and 2021 seasons of the experiment fig 9a c in general tragacanth gum foliar application on black cumin enhanced wue the plant s response to tragacanth concentration increase varied by irrigation levels it continued in drought stressed plants until a high concentration of tragacanth consumption tragacanth gum may affect the numerator grain weight and the denominator water use of the wue equation in full irrigation conditions tragacanth extract concentrations of 1 25 g l 2018 season and 2 5 g l 2020 and 2021 seasons increased wue by increasing grain weight although water usage was sometimes enhanced the foliar application significantly affected grain weight equation numerator under moderate drought stress fig 8a c in severe drought stress conditions the wue changes were due to the effects of foliar application on the numerator and denominator of the wue equation 2 5 12 correlation among traits the results showed that the correlation between the rwc of leaf and cell membrane stability total chlorophyll content and photochemical efficiency of photosystem ii was completely positive and significant p 0 001 fig 10a c there was a negative and significant correlation between rwc and h2o2 content p 0 001 fig 10d these results indicate that the presence of sufficient water in the plant caused a decrease in the production and accumulation of h2o2 and consequently increased cell membrane stability and consequently increased total chlorophyll content and photochemical efficiency of photosystem ii fig 10 e g shows the negative correlation between the amount of h2o2 with cell membrane stability total chlorophyll content and photochemical efficiency of photosystem ii and the positive correlation between cell membrane stability with total chlorophyll content fig 10h and photochemical efficiency of photosystem ii fig 10i in the present experiment there was a positive and significant correlation between the photochemical efficiency of photosystem ii and cell membrane stability with the grain weight of black cumin fig 10k and l 2 6 discussion traditionally agricultural research has focused primarily on maximizing total production abdallah et al 2018 drought stress is one of the most important factors which is a serious obstacle to increasing crop yield naderi et al 2020 today climate changes have led to a decrease in rainfall and an increase in temperature especially in arid and semi arid regions kim et al 2020 mansour et al 2021 soil moisture is affected by the amount of water entering the soil irrigation or rainfall soil moisture content determines plant access to water and its water status in the present study the pots weight decreased because of reduced soil entering water due to drought stress treatments fig 1 anti transpirant materials have been defined as chemical materials capable of reducing the transpiration rate when applied to the plant canopy glenn et al 2003 the most obvious use of anti transpirant is conserving soil water by reducing plant consumption thus reducing irrigation frequency del amor and rubio 2009 abdallah et al 2018 because nearly 95 99 of absorbed water from the soil by plant roots is transpired there is a high potential for water saving through reducing transpiration del amor and rubio 2009 boari et al 2014 foliar application of tragacanth gum on the plant reduced transpiration and consequently the amount of water consumed by the plant in different irrigation regimes it increased the pots weight fig 1 similar to this study abdullah et al 2015 in the investigation of the effect of anti transpirant agents on the weight of experimental pots reported that the use of anti transpirant agents increased the weight of the pots compared to the control treatment changes in osmotic and pressure potential in plants are influenced by various factors that determine the amount of osmotic potential and plant water status the main reason for the decrease in osmotic potential more negative in water deficit conditions is the accumulation of a series of osmotic compounds such as proline and soluble sugars najafi vafa et al 2022 the increase in osmotic compounds in the cell causes the cell turgor pressure ψp to recover and the osmotic potential ψs to decrease which is a known biochemical mechanism that enables plants to sustain water uptake blum 2017 these soluble substances also protect macromolecules cell organelles and structures such as chloroplasts from stress poudel et al 2021 also in the present study drought stress and its increasing intensity significantly reduced the plant s osmotic potential and leaf water potential more negative in three seasons fig 2 in addition water deficit significantly reduced leaf pressure potential fig 2 our results illustrated that under various irrigation regimes tragacanth gum application levels affected leaf osmotic potential differently in general in the three seasons of the experiment the low tragacanth concentrations reduced the osmotic potential less negative and increased the pressure potential its higher concentrations depending on irrigation treatments resulted in a more negative osmotic potential and a lower pressure potential in the plant fig 2 the maintenance of higher turgor pressure of leaves of plants sprayed with anti transpirant under water deficit conditions is because the anti transpirant materials reduce water loss and enable long term turgor maintenance under water deficit conditions del amor et al 2010 moreover the plant s water potential increased less negative with tragacanth extract application under different irrigation regimes this is due to the positive effects of tragacanth foliar application on decreasing osmotic potential and increasing pressure potential in plants fig 2 drought stress causes a series of serious biochemical and physiological disorders such as reduction of stomatal conductance and reduction of leaf water content makhlouf et al 2022 similarly in our study drought stress treatments led to the lowest leaf rwc in all tragacanth concentrations fig 3 the leaf rwc is a criterion of drought resistance in drought stress conditions the leaf rwc decreases due to reducing the leaf water potential and decreasing water absorption from the roots bahavar et al 2009 kabiri et al 2014 foliar application of black cumin with tragacanth may increase leaf rwc by reducing stomatal water loss closure of the stomata the complete and continuous blocking of the stomata and the plant s inability to absorb water from the soil at the high tragacanth gum concentrations may also lower leaf rwc we found leaf rwc is directly related to cellular turgor and plant water potential fig 2 cellular turgor directly affects cell growth and division thus there is a close relationship between the leaf rwc and the biological function of the plant yadav and bhushan 2001 in drought stress there will be a limited amount of nadp for electron acceptance so oxygen can act as an electron receptor acar et al 2001 so that the electrons leaked from the electron transfer chains can react with o2 during the normal metabolism of the plant yan et al 2006 this leads to the accumulation of toxic oxygen species such as radicals of superoxide o₂ hydrogen peroxide h₂o₂ and hydroxyl ohˉ also in drought stress conditions due to the limited absorption and stabilization of co2 and increased activity of the oxygenase of the rubisco enzyme photorespiration increases in c3 plants which will also lead to an increase in h2o2 miller et al 2010 many researchers have linked 70 of h2o2 produced during drought stress to photorespiration noctor et al 2002 cruz 2008 our findings corroborate the above mentioned studies fig 4 tragacanth gum significantly affected black cumin h2o2 production under drought stress foliar application of black cumin via tragacanth gum reduces plant h2o2 production especially at lower concentrations fig 4 probably tragacanth at lower concentrations decreases plant transpiration by lowering water loss through stomata enhancing the plant s water potential fig 2 and preventing drought and oxidative stress however total closure of stomata at higher concentrations of tragacanth use which may occur depending on the amount of available water at different concentrations reduces the plant s potential and rwc figs 2 and 3 induces drought stress and increases h2o2 production the occurrence of drought stress and its severity reduced cell membrane stability one of the important consequences of drought stress is oxidative stress and the production of ros tiryaki 2016 ros that are produced during stress cause damage to many cellular compositions such as lipids proteins carbohydrates and nucleic acids as a result it causes lipid peroxidation and damage cell membranes acar et al 2001 yan et al 2006 ehrenbergerova et al 2009 naliwajski and skłodowska 2021 in the present study membrane stability decreased due to lipid peroxidation of the membrane with increasing production and accumulation of ross such as h2o2 fig 4 during drought stress the highest percentage of cell membrane stability was observed in treatments with the lowest amount of h2o2 accumulation figs 4 and 5 in addition in the present study changes in cell membrane stability under different treatments were mainly similar to changes in leaf rwc content figs 3 and 5 terfore there is a positive correlation between rwc and cell membrane stability fig 10a similar to the results of our study fig 5 kabiri et al 2014 reported that drought stress reduced the rwc of the leaf and increased the damage to the membrane in addition in our study under full irrigation and moderate and severe stress respectively the effective concentration of tragacanth gum for improving cell membrane stability and chlorophyll content was increased in contrast higher concentrations of tragacanth under full irrigation and moderate drought stress were significantly reduced in terms of membrane stability as well as chlorophyll content under all irrigation treatments figs 5 and 6 one of the effects of drought stress on plants is the reduction of chlorophyll content najafi vafa et al 2022 in the present study drought stress reduced the chlorophyll content of a b and total fig 6 a number of studies confirm our findings zaki and radwan 2011 kabiri et al 2014 haj seyed hadi et al 2016 that drought stress negatively affects plant chlorophyll content they have attributed the reduction of chlorophyll content under drought stress conditions to the reduction of membrane stability gnaana saraswathi and paliwal 2011 as stated drought stress caused an increase in the production of h2o2 in the leaf by decreasing the rwc figs 3 and 4 the ros reduces photosynthesis plant growth and yield by oxidizing lipids in biological membranes damaging chloroplast structure and reduction of photosynthetic pigment content in plants anjum et al 2017 increasing h2o2 in turn will increase chlorophyll decomposition ying et al 2015 and this shows a negative correlation between h2o2 and chlorophyll amount fig 10f the reduction of chlorophyll concentration results in non stomatal limitations of photosynthesis under drought stress conditions thus chlorophyll content helps to maintain photosynthesis under drought stress shimakawa and miyake 2018 the effects of foliar application tragacanth gum and its various concentrations on the chlorophyll content of the plant in different irrigation regimes almost completely followed the effects of this substance on the potential and rwc of the leaf figs 2 and 3 production and accumulation of h2o2 fig 4 and the percentage of cell membrane stability fig 5 therefore every increase in the leaf s potential and rwc decreased the generation and accumulation of h2o2 and increased cell membrane stability and chlorophyll content in the plant consequently chlorophyll a b and total content decreased or increased similary yang et al 2018 stated that the use of anti transpirant agents increased the content of chlorophyll by increasing the rwc of the leaf it was almost the same trend in all three seasons for changes in chlorophyll content and photochemical efficiency of photosystem ii in black cumin plants treated with different levels of irrigation and concentrations of tragacanth extract in general the water deficit decreased photosystem ii s photochemical efficiency fig 7 photosynthesis is fundamental to the growth and in turn must continue under stress the decrease in chlorophyll concentration during drought stress is one of the key causes of reduced photosynthesis prakash and ramachandran 2000 which is also shown in the present study drought stress affects photosynthesis efficiency by changing the osmotic potential and the degree of stomata opening and closing yousefi et al 2020 reducing leaf rwc reduces photosynthesis and co2 processing lawlor and cornic 2002 drought stress also affects plant metabolism and destroys proteins and enzymes including photosynthetic enzymes ghani et al 2000 it has been reported that the reduction of photosynthesis under severe drought stress is due to the reduction in photosystem ii efficiency xu and zhou 2005 the decrease in co2 assimilation due to stomatal closure under drought stress may result in the non consumption of electron transfer chain products nadph and atp and an increase in decreased ferredoxin amount by increasing reduced ferredoxin the production of active radicals may be increased and the alteration or degradation of the thylakoid membrane proteins may occur therefore the destruction of thylakoid membrane proteins prevents electron transfer from the photosystem ii acceptor this object reduces the electron transfer rate increases chlorophyll fluorescence and reduces photosystem ii performance piper et al 2007 tilahun and sven 2003 also due to increased chlorophyll fluorescence under drought stress conditions photosystem ii activity is altered and the protein d1 structure is destroyed ahmed et al 2002 researchers have found that drought stress degrades the oxygen releasing complex and the d1 protein of the photosystem ii reaction centers zlatev and yordanov 2004 reducing the electron transfer rate and the quantum yield of photosystem ii under drought stress may be due to the destruction of the calvin cycle the delay in quinone regeneration and the destruction of the thylakoid membrane electron transport chain tilahun and sven 2003 the fv fm ratio reduction under drought stress indicates electron transfer from photosystem ii to photosystem i has been reduced lu zhang 1998 our acquired results fig 7 are validated by these studies our results revealed that the foliar application of plants affected the photochemical efficiency of photosystem ii in different irrigation regimes such as other studied traits the effects of tragacanth at various concentrations and levels of irrigation suggest that its application as an anti transpirant agent ultimately depends on the plant s water status these results agree with those reported by abdullah et al 2015 they reported that applying an anti transpirant agent increased the photochemical efficiency of photosystem ii without a change in stomatal conductance the increase in photochemical efficiency of photosystem ii due to tragacanth gum application can be attributed to an increase in the cuticle thickness of the leaf a decrease in water loss and a consequent increase in leaf rwc and water status fig 3 although the plant is in good condition regarding access to water decrease in the plant s photochemical efficiency of photosystem ii at high concentrations seems to be due to the effect of tragacanth gum application on reducing stomatal conductance and plant gas exchange for the photosynthesis process the stomata perform two processes together one is water removal and the other is carbon dioxide absorption due to stomata openings carbon dioxide s initial absorption is associated with water s outflow therefore the lower the outflow of water at high levels of anti transpirant compounds the amount of carbon dioxide is lower brillante et al 2016 the use of anti transpirant compounds under optimal irrigation conditions reduces plant growth and photosynthesis processes due to the adverse effect of these compounds on entering and exiting gases in the plant brillante et al 2016 which is consistent with the results of the present research photosynthesis growth and plant yield are among the physiological factors that drought stress affects chaves et al 2002 xiang et al 2021 xiang et al 2022 the research results indicate that plants are often less likely to grow when exposed to environmental stress because in this condition they allocate existing photoassimilates to increase the synthesis of secondary metabolites terpene compounds to survive in severe environmental conditions bettaieb et al 2009 rebey et al 2012 during experiments we found that drought stress reduced the potential and content of leaf water figs 2 and 3 and increased the production of h2o2 fig 4 thereby negatively affecting cell membrane stability there was a decrease in chlorophyll content fig 6 and the photosystem ii s photochemical efficiency fig 7 as a result drought stress can adversely affect source reservoir relationships during the growth stage resulting in a significant loss of grain weight pessarkli 1999 other researchers have also reported reduced black cumin yield during drought stress rezaei chiyaneh et al 2018 haj seyed hadi et al 2016 in agreement with the obviously obtained results and the above mentioned cases our study showed that drought stress caused a significant decrease in grain weight in three seasons so the lowest grain weight belonged to plants under severe drought stress especially in tragacanth non consumption treatment fig 8 the effects of different concentrations of tragacanth gum application on the above mentioned traits are finally manifested in the grain yield at full irrigation level the grain weight of plants with more than 2 5 g l tragacanth gum decreased significantly compared to control plants in moderate drought stressed plants high concentration 10 g l of tragacanth gum foliar application significantly decreased grain weight foliar application enhanced grain weight under severe drought stress conditions fig 8 in order to justify the effects of foliar application of tragacanth on grain weight in different irrigation regimes it can be stated that grain weight is significantly affected by the effects of different concentrations of tragacanth consumption on the traits such as water potential and leaf rwc figs 2 and 3 the production of h2o2 fig 4 cell membrane stability fig 5 chlorophyll content fig 6 and the photochemical efficiency of the photosystem ii fig 7 the trend of changes in grain weight in different irrigation regimes and under the influence of foliar application with various concentrations of tragacanth gum follows the variation trend of these traits in the mentioned conditions the results demonstrate a positive correlation between rwc and grain yield fig 10j due to the positive effects of plant rwc on the reduction of h2o2 content improvement of cell membrane stability an increase in chlorophyll content and photochemical efficiency of photosystem ii an improvement in photosynthesis in the plant and consequently an increase in grain weight fig 10 any factor that improves the water status of the plant can increase the plant s production capacity and yield by the effect of the parameters mentioned our findings agree with yang et al 2018 studies which showed the use of anti transpiration agents increased grain weight in maize plants due to the increasing rwc of the leaf chlorophyll content and photosynthesis without a change in stomatal conductance understanding the relationship between wue and plant yield in areas exposed to drought stress is very important in recent years the focus has shifted to maximizing wue rather than yield savic et al 2011 there is a high potential for saving water by reducing transpiration since 95 99 of soil absorbed water by plant roots is transpired boari et al 2014 the use of anti transpiration agents is one of the management methods for achieving maximum wue in regions with insufficient water or when there is end of season drought stress abdullah et al 2015 abdallah et al 2019b drought stress decreases plant wue fig 9 in general our findings illustrated that the foliar application of tragacanth gum to the black cumin plant enhanced wue the plant s response to a higher concentration of tragacanth varied with irrigation levels it continued under drought stress especially severe drought stress until a high concentration of tragacanth consumption was reached fig 9 in other words foliar application with tragacanth gum increased wue to high concentrations by increasing grain weight and reducing black cumin s water usage fig 8 and 9 these effects suggest tragacanth gum s anti transpiration properties in a study by abdallah et al 2018 it was shown that anti transpiration agents increased photosynthesis without increasing stomatal conductance the positive effect of tragacanth on improving the wue of plants under full irrigation was attributed to the low concentration of this material under full irrigation conditions there is no limit to the transpiration and photosynthesis of the plant the application of tragacanth acts like an anti transpiration agent and affects transpiration and stomatal conductance in the plant in the present study the application of high concentrations of tragacanth gum reduced the rwc of leaves fig 3 and caused drought stress in the plant figs 4 5 6 and 7 in fact higher concentrations of tragacanth cause more stomata to be close to the point where in addition to transpiration photosynthesis and substance formation in the plant are also greatly reduced and this means a decrease in dry matter production fig 8 the dry matter produced is the numerator of the fraction in the water use efficiency wue formula therefore the greater reduction of the numerator of the fraction compared to the denominator of the fraction of the wue equation led to a decrease in the wue value at higher concentrations of tragacanth gum application by spraying anti transpirant substances on pepper plant leaves the amount of transpiration and stomatal conductance decreased del amor et al 2010 in the present experiment different traits from year to year were affected by several factors including soil texture and weather conditions on the one hand the pot soil type and texture for 2018 were different from the soil used for 2020 and 2021 seasons the variation in water holding capacity in these soils caused differences in soil water content and in this way we determined the effect of soil texture on the effects of various irrigation treatments and application levels of tragacanth extract on different traits on the other hand temperature values during the growing season varied over three seasons in addition to the cases mentioned above natural sunlight was used to illuminate the greenhouse this naturally changes from year to year examining these differences over three seasons allowed us to evaluate the effectiveness of various concentrations of tragacanth gum under various weather conditions adjusted within the ranges mentioned in materials and methods it also helped us describe more confidently the effects of tragacanth gum as a novel antiperspirant furthermore it helped us conclude that tragacanth gum cannot be recommended under all conditions at a specific concentration choosing the appropriate concentration for this substance depends on soil texture weather conditions and the amount of water available to the plant 2 7 conclusion the results of this study indicated the different effects of various concentrations of tragacanth material in different irrigation levels on the studied traits of black cumin the trend of changes in physiological and biochemical traits of black cumin plants under varying irrigation levels and tragacanth extract concentrations was practically the same in all three seasons however experimental conditions may have caused some differences between three seasons results our findings showed that tragacanth gum concentrations depended on the plant s water state so using higher concentrations of tragacanth gum in drought stress conditions had a more positive effect on the plant and vice versa using a lower concentration of this material was helpful in full irrigation the results of experiments showed that the application of this material has been effective in improving water status increasing wue in black cumin decreasing production and accumulation of h2o2 reducing destructive effects caused by ros increasing the membrane stability increasing the plant chlorophyll content improving photochemical efficiency of photosystem ii and consequently improving grain weight also applying the proper concentration of the tragacanth material could significantly increase grain weight in moderate and severe drought stress conditions compared to non foliar application conditions therefore in most years tragacanth gum can be introduced and used as an anti transpiration matter in areas exposed to drought stress at the end of the season which requires further research additionally if it is used as an anti transpiration agent its concentration must be determined for each plant considering the severity of drought stress in the area declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing
