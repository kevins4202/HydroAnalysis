19285,ceramic membrane bioreactor mbr has attracted increasing interest due to its high flux long membrane life span and excellent resistance to hash operation conditions although ozone has been used for chemical cleaning of ceramic membranes it is still unclear about the role of dissolved organic matter dom generated during on line chemical cleaning with ozone in the development of membrane fouling in ceramic mbr this study clearly revealed that the released dom could considerably induce irreversible membrane fouling and humic acid like substances hal with molecular weight mw of about 500 da were mainly responsible for the observed membrane fouling a strong positive relationship existed between the membrane fouling rate of supernatant and the rejection level of hal evidenced by a high correlation coefficient r2 of 0 99 meanwhile the results also showed that biopolymers with mw greater than 10 kda were easily rejected by the ceramic membranes used leading to the development of membrane fouling however the high ozone concentration helped to reduce the generation of biopolymers the organic fractions with mw less than 500 da in the dom e g building blocks low mw acid and low mw neutrals could pass through the ceramic membranes used i e their contributions to the observed membrane fouling could be considered insignificant consequently it appeared from this study that membrane fouling associated with the dom generated by ozone during on line chemical cleaning should not be ignored in the design and operation of ceramic mbr towards long term process sustainability graphical abstract image keywords dissolved organic matter membrane fouling ozone on line chemical cleaning ceramic membranes 1 introduction recently the application of ceramic membranes in water and wastewater treatment is growing due to their inherent advantages over conventional polymeric membranes such as high surface hydrophilicity good mechanical and chemical stability etc zhang et al 2018 although the price of commercially available ceramic membrane modules is still 2 to 4 times higher than similar polymeric products the longer lifespan and the ability of ceramic membranes to pair with a wide range of treatment conditions in turn can offset the high cost ibn abdul hamid et al 2017 however membrane fouling is still a major problem encountered during the application and operation of ceramic membranes zebić avdičević et al 2017 to cope with such a challenge regular on line chemical cleaning has been widely practiced for mitigating membrane fouling and recovering permeability in membrane bioreactors mbr as a powerful oxidant ozone has been employed for membrane fouling control park et al 2015 tang et al 2017a wei et al 2016a ceramic membranes have the robust chemical stability and can withstand severe oxidizing conditions in the presence of ozone and hydroxyl radicals tang et al 2017a the ceramic membrane filtration combined with ozonation exhibited less reduction in trans membrane pressure tmp in wastewater and surface water treatment park et al 2017 the ozone concentration used for cleaning purpose is normally in the range up to 10 mg l 1 or even higher in some special cases tang et al 2017a 2018 song et al 2018 during on line chemical cleaning of mbr the cleaning agents are directly injected into membranes in the reverse direction to the normal filtration while the membranes are still submerged in sludge suspension as a result the chemical agents passed through membranes eventually end up in the bulk suspension i e the contact between activated sludge and cleaning agent is inevitable in mbr the previous study clearly demonstrated that ozone could trigger the generation of dissolved organic matter dom during on line chemical cleaning due to bacterial lysis sun et al 2018 dom has been widely reported as the main cause of membrane fouling in water treatment by microfiltration mf and ultrafiltration uf guo et al 2012 tang et al 2010 most of studies only focused on the effectiveness of ozone with respect to membrane fouling control but the quantitative contribution of subcomponents of dom generated during membrane cleaning by ozonation has not been reported towards membrane fouling so far while the impacts of dom on filtration performance of ceramic mbr still remains unclear therefore this study aimed to investigate the membrane fouling potential of dom generated during on line chemical cleaning with ozone in a ceramic mbr for this purpose activated sludge was first exposed to ozone with different concentrations afterwards the treated activated sludge and supernatant were used for subsequent fouling studies in a standard ceramic crossflow system the relationships between the membrane fouling rates and the organic fractions of dom were systematically analyzed it is expected that this study can offer better understanding of membrane fouling associated with dom generated by ozone during on line chemical cleaning and such information is useful for further design of ceramic mbr towards a long term stability 2 materials and methods 2 1 biological contact assay activated sludge collected from a pilot membrane bioreactor located in a local water reclamation plant singapore was acclimatized with synthetic wastewater for one month which mainly contained 690 mg l 1 sodium acetate 313 mg l 1 glucose 200 mg l 1 nh4cl 60 mg l 1 k2hpo4 and other trace minerals the acclimated activated sludge was washed thrice with 10 mm of phosphate buffered saline pbs solution before use biological contact assays were carried out in a series of 1 l airtight reactors in which the initial ozone concentrations were controlled at the levels of 2 5 5 0 7 5 and 10 0 mg l 1 respectively which were selected according to those reported in mbrs during chemical cleaning song et al 2018 tang et al 2017a b the initial biomass concentration was maintained at about 1000 mg l 1 vss and a control assay free of ozone exposure was also conducted the contact time between activated sludge and ozone was set to 30 min after which nearly all the ozone was exhausted thereafter the collected supernatants were filtered through 0 45 μm ptfe filters for further dom and soluble dna analyses 2 2 ozone generation ozone gas was generated by an ozone generator atlas 30 absoluteozone canada connected with an oxygen concentrator airsep newlife intensity oxygen concentrator usa this unit can generate about 30 g h 1 ozone and produced ozone gas was directly injected into a 5 l of dissolution reactor filled of millipore water through a diffuser located at the bottom the mass flow of ozone gas to the dissolution reactor was controlled by a mass flow controller new flow taiwan for achieving the target dissolved ozone concentrations of 2 5 5 0 7 5 and 10 0 mg l 1 respectively the concentration of dissolved ozone in water was measured by a dissolved ozone analyzer analytical technology inc usa with the accuracy of 0 1 mg l 1 the excessive ozone was then destroyed by an ozone destroyer ozonetek ltd india the whole system fig 1 was controlled by a programmable logic controller plc 2 3 cross flow microfiltration test after 30 min contact with ozone 1 0 l of sludge suspension was fed into a standard crossflow microfiltration module fig 2 to investigate membrane fouling behaviors of activated sludge exposed to ozone in addition 800 ml of supernatant collected from sludge suspension after 2 h settling was also fed into the crossflow module to evaluate the fouling potential of released dom ceramic membranes jwcmo1 12 jiuwu hi tech china with the nominal pore size of 0 2 μm and the effective surface area of 75 36 cm2 were mounted to the crossflow cell tmp changes during membrane filtration were monitored by two pressure sensors installed on both inlet and outlet of the filtration module and readings were recorded with labview software at the time intervals of 12 s a constant permeate flux of 30 l m 2 h 1 was maintained through automatic adjustment of peristaltic pump cole parmer usa the circulation flowrate in the feed chamber was controlled at 0 2 l min 1 by a flowmeter wf waterflow in this study when tmp reached 40 kpa the filtration experiments were stopped afterwards the permeate of microfiltration was collected for dom analysis 2 4 determination of membrane fouling resistance the fouling resistance of the membranes was calculated using the resistance in series model cheryan 1998 1 rt tmp μpj 2 rt rm rp rc where tmp is the transmembrane pressure pa μp is the water viscosity at 27 c i e 0 8545 10 3 pa s j is the permeate flux m3 m 2 s 1 rt rm rp and rc are the total fouling resistance intrinsic membrane resistance pore blocking resistance and cake layer resistance respectively m 1 at a constant flux rt can be determined by eq 1 with recorded tmp while rm is obtained by filtering ultrapure water through a virgin membrane afterwards the fouled membranes were gently wiped with a sponge and rinsed with water to remove the cake layer and such cleaned membrane is used for filtration of ultrapure water to determine rp with applied tmp lastly rc can be calculated form eq 2 all the experiments were performed in triplicate 2 5 dom rejection analyses the rejection of each sub component in dom by membranes was calculated by eq 3 3 cr cs cp where cs and cp are the concentrations of sub component of dom in supernatant and permeate respectively triplicated experiments were performed for each condition 2 6 lc ocd ond analyses a size exclusion chromatography organic carbon detection organic nitrogen detection lc ocd ond system doclabor karlsruhe germany was used to characterize dom which was equipped with a software program chrom calc doc labor karlsruhe germany for data acquisition and analysis details of the measurement procedure can be found elsewhere huber et al 2011 injection volume of samples was set to be 1000 μl the identified organic fractions included biopolymers 10 kda humic acid like substances hal with mw of approx 500 da building blocks mw 300 500 da low molecular weight neutrals lmw neutrals with mw 350 da and low molecular weight acids lmw acids with mw 350 da hydrophobic doc ho doc and doc the concentration of ho doc was calculated as the difference between doc concentration i e the value measured in the column bypass and hydrophilic organic carbon concentration hi doc i e the value obtained from the whole curve of the chromatogram the fraction of each sub organic component was calculated as the ratio of its respective concentration to total doc 2 7 other measurements doc was measured by total organic carbon analyzer shimadzu japan the quant it picogreen dsdna assay kit molecular probes thermo fisher scientific usa was used to determine soluble dna concentration and the lambda dna was used as the standard the fluorescence intensity was recorded by a microplate reader tecan infinite 200 pro a redundancy analysis method rda was applied for correlating the rejection level of fractionated dom and membrane fouling rate in which the rejection contents of sub organic components i e hal biopolymers ho doc and lmw organics by ceramic membranes used and ozone concentrations were chosen as 5 different explanatory variables and the average membrane fouling rate membrane fouling resistances were used as response variables all data were analyzed by the software canoco version 5 0 3 results and discussion 3 1 membrane fouling potential of sludge suspension upon the exposure to ozone fig 3 a shows the respective tmp profiles observed in the filtration of the sludge suspension after exposed to ozone at different concentrations it was found that the tmp jump was positively related to the ozone concentration fig 3b further illustrated the average membrane fouling rates of sludge suspension and a quasi linear correlation to the ozone concentration was observed with the correlation coefficient r2 of 0 97 for example the membrane fouling rate of activated sludge exposed to 10 mg l 1 of ozone i e 0 82 kpa min 1 was about 2 48 fold of that obtained in the control free of ozone exposure i e 0 33 kpa min 1 these suggested that ozone as a cleaning agent for membrane fouling could pose negative impacts on microorganisms thus induce post membrane fouling in fact on line chemical cleaning with ozone should be regarded as a double edged sword i e ozone can alleviate membrane fouling due to its strong oxidizing ability to destruct organic compounds but also can cause bacterial lysis leading to generation of dom which in turn may accelerate membrane fouling membrane fouling can be classified as reversible and irreversible fouling reversible fouling occurs due to the cake layer developed at the membrane rejection surface while irreversible fouling is mainly caused by chemisorption and pore plugging mechanisms guo et al 2012 table 1 shows the distribution of fouling resistances due to cake layer and pore blocking by activated sludge after the exposure to ozone with different concentrations in the control experiment cake resistance rc was found to contribute to 82 83 of the fouling resistance i e rc rp implying that cake formation was the major contributor of the observed membrane fouling however pore blocking resistance rp tended to rapidly increase with rising ozone concentration compared to the control rp was increased by 185 after the exposure of activated sludge to 10 mg l 1 of ozone accounted for 48 98 of the observed fouling resistance on the contrary the contribution of cake resistance decreased from 82 83 to 51 02 when the ozone concentration increased from 0 to 10 mg l 1 moreover fig 3c further revealed that the rate of pore blocking resistance i e δrp δt dramatically increased with the ozone concentration but the rate of cake resistance i e δrc δt remained almost unchanged it is reasonable to consider that pore blocking i e irreversible fouling should be mainly responsible for the observed membrane fouling after the exposure of activated sludge to ozone 3 2 membrane fouling potential of supernatant upon the exposure to ozone fig 4 shows the released dom in supernatants after the exposure of activated sludge to ozone with different concentrations the doc concentration in liquid phase was found to be proportional the ozone concentration compared to the control the doc concentration was increased by 326 after the exposure of activated sludge to 10 mg l 1 of ozone while the soluble dna level in the liquid phase was also increased accordingly these results clearly suggested that the observed dom mainly originated from biomass lysis after the exposure of biomass to ozone this finding is also consistent with the previous report sun et al 2018 the supernatants collected from the sludge suspensions after exposed to different ozone concentrations were fed into the crossflow microfiltration system in order to investigate the membrane fouling potential of generated dom fig 5 shows the tmp profiles and average membrane fouling rates of supernatants after activated sludge exposed to ozone with different concentrations it can be seen that the membrane fouling rate of supernatants was positively related to the ozone concentration compared with the control free of ozone exposure the membrane fouling rate increased by 193 after the exposure of activated sludge to 10 mg l 1 of ozone accompanied by an increase in doc concentration by 9 97 mg l 1 fig 4 further correlation analyses revealed a strong positive relationship between dtmp dt and ozone concentration while a similar trend was also observed for dtmp dt and doc concentration as can be seen in table 2 pore blocking was further identified as the main fouling mechanism due to the fact that rp accounted for more than 91 of the fouling resistance for all supernatants obviously the dom released from ozone triggered bacterial lysis could cause serious irreversible membrane fouling which would negatively impact on the long term performance of ceramic mbr 3 3 membrane rejection of dom and its implication on ceramic membrane fouling 3 3 1 characteristics of generated dom the major organic fractions in dom were quantatively analyzed by lc ocd ond fig 6 for the control free of ozone exposure ho doc with the abundance of 34 was found to be dominant in dom followed by biopolymer 24 hal 23 and lmw neutrals 12 however after the exposure of activated sludge to different ozone concentrations hal with mw of about 500 da became the most abundant fraction in dom accounting for 25 31 of dom fig 6a in addition building blocks lmw neutrals lmw acids and ho doc in dom were also found to increase with increasing ozone concentration on the contrary the fraction of biopolymers with mw greater than 10 kda tended to decrease rapidly fig 6b the existing evidence suggests that hal in dom probably originated from the decomposition of dead cells and macromolecular organics henderson et al 2008 while it had also been reported that increased hal was associated with decreased protein like substances in dom sun et al 2018 in fact it has been known that ozone as a strong oxidant can destroy cell walls of microorganism leading to the release of intracellular cytoplasm he et al 2006 by breakdown of biopolymers by ozone high mw organic compounds can be eventually transformed to low mw hydrophilic substances qi et al 2018 wei et al 2016b in this study the hydrophilic fractions in dom with mw of 500 da or smaller i e hal building blocks lmw neutrals lmw acids accounted for 74 of the total dom after the exposure of activated sludge to 10 mg l 1 of ozone i e ozone could effectively break up high mw biopolymers during chemical cleaning of ceramic mbr this in turn may pose a potential issue when permeate recycle and reuse are concerned 3 3 2 relationship between membrane fouling rate and released dom in order to better understand the membrane fouling mechanisms by eleased dom the rejectons efficiency of fractionated dom by ceramic memrbanes were explored fig 7 two salient points can be observed in fig 7 i compared to the other components in dom hal could be more readily retained by the ceramic mmebrane used in this study i the rejection rate of hal was improved significantly with increasing the ozone concentration in the studied range moreover the memrbane fouling rate of supernatant was found to be postively related to the rejection level of hal evidenced by a high correlation coefficient r2 of 0 99 rda analysis also revealed a similar trend between the membrane fouling rate of supernatant and the rejection level of hal by ceramic membranes used in this study according to the rda analysis out of all the parameters examined i e hal biopolymers lmw organics and ho doc the variability of dtmp dt and rp were largely determined by hal fig 8 i e hal was mainly responsible for the observed irreversible membrane fouling induced by dom in the ceramic mbr on contrary to hal the rejection level of biopolymers with high mw was found to decrease with increasing ozone concentration this can be explained by the reduced generation of biopolymers at higher ozone concentrations as illustrated in fig 6b however it should be noted that biopolymers in mbr suspension could increase the turbidity and viscosity of sludge supernatant considerablely and posed profound impacts on membrane fouling a small increase in biopolymers concentration by 20 was reported to increase membrane fouing rate by 120 sun et al 2011 for example even though the bippolymers reduced at high ozone concentartion about 26 36 of biopolymers were found to be remained by ceramic membranes used in this study i e the conbritution of biopolymers towards the observed membrane fouling shoul not be negligible although the concentrations of ho doc and low mw organic fractions mw 500 da i e building blocks lmw acid lmw neutrals in supernatants tended to increase with increasing ozone concentration fig 6 their rejection contents indeed were comparable at the ozone concentrations of 2 5 10 mg l 1 for example only about 6 10 of these substances were rejected by ceramic membranes suggesting that dissolved organic compounds with mw less than 500 da could easily penetrate through the ceramic membranes used as such their contributions to the observed membrane fouling would be insignificant 4 conclusions this study investigated the membrane fouling potential of dom generated by ozone during on line chemical cleaning in a ceramic mbr it can be concluded that the generated dom had a profound impact on irreversible membrane fouling while hal with mw of about 500 da was mainly responsible for the observed membrane fouling evidenced by a strong positive relationship between the membrane fouling rate of supernatant and the rejection level of hal r2 0 99 on the other hand biopolymers with mw greater than 10 kda could be easily rejected by ceramic membranes likely initiating the development of membrane fouling however it was also found that the generation of biopolymers was reduced substantially with increasing ozone concentration due to their breakup to low mw substances the organic fractions with mw less than 500 da in dom could pass through the ceramic membranes used and may not significantly contribute to the observed membrane fouling it is expected that this study may offer deeper insights into the undesirable impacts of on line chemical cleaning with ozone on the development of membrane fouling in ceramic mbr

points can be observed in fig 7 i compared to the other components in dom hal could be more readily retained by the ceramic mmebrane used in this study i the rejection rate of hal was improved significantly with increasing the ozone concentration in the studied range moreover the memrbane fouling rate of supernatant was found to be postively related to the rejection level of hal evidenced by a high correlation coefficient r2 of 0 99 rda analysis also revealed a similar trend between the membrane fouling rate of supernatant and the rejection level of hal by ceramic membranes used in this study according to the rda analysis out of all the parameters examined i e hal biopolymers lmw organics and ho doc the variability of dtmp dt and rp were largely determined by hal fig 8 i e hal was mainly responsible for the observed irreversible membrane fouling induced by dom in the ceramic mbr on contrary to hal the rejection level of biopolymers with high mw was found to decrease with increasing ozone concentration this can be explained by the reduced generation of biopolymers at higher ozone concentrations as illustrated in fig 6b however it should be noted that biopolymers in mbr suspension could increase the turbidity and viscosity of sludge supernatant considerablely and posed profound impacts on membrane fouling a small increase in biopolymers concentration by 20 was reported to increase membrane fouing rate by 120 sun et al 2011 for example even though the bippolymers reduced at high ozone concentartion about 26 36 of biopolymers were found to be remained by ceramic membranes used in this study i e the conbritution of biopolymers towards the observed membrane fouling shoul not be negligible although the concentrations of ho doc and low mw organic fractions mw 500 da i e building blocks lmw acid lmw neutrals in supernatants tended to increase with increasing ozone concentration fig 6 their rejection contents indeed were comparable at the ozone concentrations of 2 5 10 mg l 1 for example only about 6 10 of these substances were rejected by ceramic membranes suggesting that dissolved organic compounds with mw less than 500 da could easily penetrate through the ceramic membranes used as such their contributions to the observed membrane fouling would be insignificant 4 conclusions this study investigated the membrane fouling potential of dom generated by ozone during on line chemical cleaning in a ceramic mbr it can be concluded that the generated dom had a profound impact on irreversible membrane fouling while hal with mw of about 500 da was mainly responsible for the observed membrane fouling evidenced by a strong positive relationship between the membrane fouling rate of supernatant and the rejection level of hal r2 0 99 on the other hand biopolymers with mw greater than 10 kda could be easily rejected by ceramic membranes likely initiating the development of membrane fouling however it was also found that the generation of biopolymers was reduced substantially with increasing ozone concentration due to their breakup to low mw substances the organic fractions with mw less than 500 da in dom could pass through the ceramic membranes used and may not significantly contribute to the observed membrane fouling it is expected that this study may offer deeper insights into the undesirable impacts of on line chemical cleaning with ozone on the development of membrane fouling in ceramic mbr 
19286,the therapeutic efficacy of antiretroviral drugs as well as challenges and side effects against the human immunodeficiency virus is well documented and reviewed evidence is available in literature indication that antiretrovirals are only partially transformed and become completely excreted from the human body in their original form and or as metabolites in urine and feces the possibility of massive release of antiretrovirals through human excreta that enters surface water through surface runoff and wastewater treatment plant effluents is now of environmental concern because the public might be experiencing chronic exposure to antiretrovirals the primary concern of this review is limited data concerning environmental fate and ecotoxicity of antiretrovirals and their metabolites the review aims to provide a comprehensive insight into the evaluation of antiretrovirals in environmental samples the objective is therefore to assess the extent of analysis of antiretrovirals in environmental samples and also look at strategies including instrumentation and predictive models that have been reported in literature on the fate and ecotoxicological effects due to presence of antiretrovirals in different environmental compartments the review also looks at current challenges and offers possible areas of exploration that could help minimize the presence of antiretrovirals in the environment graphical abstract image keywords antiretrovirals hiv aids antiretroviral combination therapy predicted environmental concentration predicted no effect concentration environmental samples 1 introduction antiretroviral drugs arvs are medications used in the treatment of retroviral infections primarily human immunodeficiency virus type 1 hiv 1 hiv 1 is a virus that attacks mainly the cd4 t cells responsible for the body s immune system however antiretroviral treatment against hiv 1 does not cure or kill the virus but rather prevents or slows down its multiplication deeks et al 2013 once the blood viral load has been suppressed to below detection limits minimal or no further damage is done on the immune system this leads to an improvement in one s health fewer opportunistic infections and a prolonged life expectance the impact of an antiretroviral treatment against hiv 1 can be categorized into four the virological purpose in which the target is to reduce the viral load the immunological purpose in which the target is to improve the immune system the therapeutical purpose in which the target is to reduce side effects symptoms and opportunistic infections as well as the epidemiological purpose where the target is to prevent hiv 1 transmission from one person to another the inability of arvs to completely eradicate hiv 1 from the body implies that a dormant reservoir of infected memory t cells persists in the body of an infected person the virus resurfaces and replicates itself when these latent t cells are used to replace old cd4 cells thus the victims are required to take arv medication for the rest of their lives to suppress its multiplication the current public health concerns of arv therapy have mainly focused on side effects long term consumption effects and development as well as transmission of resistant viral strains due to drug drug interferences non adherence and inconsistence in prescribed dosages carr and cooper 2000 cihlar and fordyce 2016 esté and cihlar 2010 fisher et al 2006 hawkins 2010 linnemayr and stecher 2015 who 2017a another burning issue has been the fear of introducing new drugs to communities based on small scale clinical tests vitoria et al 2017 the environmental fate and the impact of presence of arvs in drinking water and food sources is still yet to be fully reviewed jain et al 2013 have reviewed the occurrence and removal of antivirals with an emphasis on the influenza drugs acyclovir and oseltamivir jain et al 2013 esté and cihlar 2010 have focused on arv efficacy esté and cihlar 2010 while warnke et al 2007 and temesgen et al 2006 have done arv therapeutic reviews temesgen et al 2006 warnke et al 2007 generally a few pharmaceutical review articles report partially on the presence and fate of arvs in environmental samples gwenzi and chaukura 2018 jain et al 2013 madikizela et al 2017 yang et al 2017 for example in a review article presented by madikizela et al 2017 the primary focus was on the occurrence of a wide variety of pharmaceuticals in african water bodies with arvs only mentioned in passing in view of the scope mentioned above we have identified a gap in the total understanding of the presence of arvs in various environmental compartments we therefore seek to provide a compressive insight into the environmental fate and ecotoxicological effect of arvs as a special branch of pharmaceuticals while the arv therapy which is currently freely available to every human being has greatly improved lives of people living with hiv aids with probabilistic hiv aids pandemic projections indicating a big drop in casualties in a few years to come sharrow et al 2017 the extent of release of these drugs through excretion and disposal of unused or expired medication needs to be considered overall the aim of the present work was to critically review the current worldwide status on the environmental monitoring and fate as well as ecotoxicological effects of arvs the overview of antiretroviral treatment programs and global consumption rates of arvs are reviewed with the intention of pointing out the importance of their analysis in the environment furthermore based on studies reported in literature the conclusions were drawn and future perspectives are discussed in the present review 2 types of antiretroviral drugs there are basically six classes of arvs depending on their molecular mechanism and resistance profiles mode of action arts and hazuda 2012 each class refers to the phase of the retrovirus life cycle targeted by the drug bailey and fisher 2008 these classes and their mode of action are summarized in table 1 the replication cycle of hiv is well documented arts and hazuda 2012 temesgen et al 2006 warnke et al 2007 the nucleoside nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors nrtis are considered the backbone of hiv treatment because they act early in the replication viral cycle by preventing reverse transcription of the viral rna into its dna an essential step before the virus could integrate itself into the host cell this is achieved by interfering with a viral enzyme responsible for this purpose called reverse transcriptase the protease inhibitors pis target the virus during reproduction of an infected cell lv et al 2015 these inhibitors act by preventing the latent hiv dna from fragmenting into components required for producing hiv rna strands they block the viral protease enzyme the pi ritonavir has a further advantage of enhancing the systematic exposure of other pis and as such is now preferred as a booster for other arvs in combination therapy abers et al 2014 boesecke and cooper 2008 entry inhibitors act by preventing the virus from attaching to a body cell the integrase inhibitors act by preventing the insertion of the viral dna into the dna of the body cell they target the hiv integrase enzyme cytochrome p450 3a inhibitors are not anti retrovirals but rather act as pharmacokinetic enhancers of other arvs this is achieved by inhibiting cytochrome p450 3a isoforms responsible for metabolizing arvs the increased efficacy of arvs then becomes an advantage in terms of dosage amounts and potential for side effects 3 antiretroviral combination therapy one of the major challenges in understanding hiv is its inability to proofread the enzymes responsible for reverse transcription from its rna to dna this results in multiple mutant viral offspring some of these mutants become genetically superior to the parent virus through natural selection and become resistant to the body s immune system as well as arvs the target therefore is to reduce the viral load as quickly as possible so as to minimize the probability of producing resistant strains this is achieved by preventing viral replication at its different stages of development through combination antiretroviral therapy cart passaes and sáez cirión 2014 the idea of cart is that if one mutant becomes resistant to a particular drug the other drugs in the combination cocktail continue to suppress replication of that mutant the common trend is to use two nrtis as a backbone in combination with one of the drugs from other classes especially an nnrti or a pi cihlar and fordyce 2016 lennox et al 2009 this triple combination also referred to as highly active antiretroviral therapy haart has proved to be an effective cocktail against the virus the effectiveness of these carts against mutants depends on the adherence and consistence of taking the prescribed medication the choice of combination therapy depends on various factors including the viral load the patient s cd4 count age tolerability and availability of arvs some companies have developed single drug formats with fixed dose combinations these include atripla and complera both of which consist of two nrtis emtricitabine and tenofovir and one nnrti efavirenz for atripla and rilpivine for complera other triple drug combination pills include trizivir an all nrti regimen pill consisting of abacavir zidovudine and lamivudine as well as triumeq which consists of two nrtis abacavir and lamivudine and an integrase inhibitor dolutegravir some combination single dosage pills consist of four arvs these include stribild and genvoya both of which consist of emtricitabine nrti tenofovir nrti elvitegravir integrase inhibitor and cobicistat pharmacokinetic enhancer the common single drug formats with two arvs are combivir lamivudine and zidovudine epzicom abacavir lamivudine and truvada tenofovir emtricitabine other two drug pills include the protease inhibitor pharmacokinetic enhancer combinations such as evotaz atazanavir and cobicistat and prezcobix darunavir and cobicistat the main advantage of fixed dose combination pills is reduction in pill burden while at the same time ensuring adherence to prescription cihlar and ray 2010 these single pill regimens are mainly recommended for persons who just tested positive and the virus has not yet caused complications to the immune system even though there are several combination therapies who has recommended atripla a fixed dose combination regimen pill consisting of tenofovir efavirenz and emtricitabine as a starter for anyone recently diagnosed with hiv who 2016a in cases where efavirenz causes side effects nevirapine is usually used as a substitute even though triple therapy has ensured that viral multiplication and its probability of developing drug resistance is greatly reduced the success of a combination treatment regimen remains complex the combination components may need to be taken separately at specific times every day either after or before meals deviations from these prescribed specifications will result in the virus quickly developing resistance to the drug combination studies have shown that a mere 5 deviation may cause the regimen to drop its effectiveness against the virus to 81 at 70 treatment commitment the effectiveness drops to a mere 6 furthermore a change in drug composition of the treatment regimen is required throughout the life of a person living with hiv implying that the patient has to be committed to ensure adherence to the treatment program 4 global status of hiv aids 4 1 hiv aids epidemiology according to the who global health observatory data repository there was an estimated 36 7 million people living with hiv aids by end of 2016 dataset of these cases 70 were from africa 10 in the south east asia 9 in the americas 6 in europe 4 in the western pacific and only 1 was in the eastern mediterranean fig 1 shows all the countries that had over 100 000 reported cases of hiv in 2016 african countries contribute 60 of the listed countries south africa alone had a massive 7 1 million of its population estimated to be hiv positive this was more than twice that of nigeria whose hiv aids prevalence is the second worst in africa and estimated at 3 2 million considering the percentage of infected persons as a ratio of a country s population swaziland had the highest percentage ratio of people living with hiv aids estimated at 22 of its total population fig 2 shows all the countries with at least 0 5 of its population infected with hiv in 2016 based on the data presented in fig 2 16 african countries were leading in the top 50 countries with the highest population percentage of people living with hiv aids in 2016 sub saharan africa is the most affected region with all the nine countries having 5 or more of their population coming from this region 4 2 antiretroviral treatment programs the global estimate of people receiving arv treatment as of 2016 was 19 8 million fig 3 shows that south africa had the biggest antiretroviral treatment art program estimated at 3 9 million people receiving arvs this value is at least 4 times the number of any other art program in the world and equates to about 24 of the world art program even though south africa india and kenya are the only countries with over a million of patients in their treatment programs fig 3 this only contributes 56 49 and 64 of the infected individuals respectively in those countries nigeria has the second highest number of people living with hiv aids yet only 30 were on art programs in 2016 figs 1 and 3 the countries with the most effective programs in terms of number of people under treatment compared to the number infected are australia 90 sweden and botswana 83 rwanda italy cambodia and switzerland all 80 the other countries with more than three quarters of its infected population on art programs in the year 2016 were swaziland 79 france 78 spain and ireland 77 algeria 76 and zimbabwe 75 swaziland has a roller coaster hiv aids story in that it has the highest hiv aids prevalence and also one of the most successful art programs however these statistics on national art programs cannot be used entirely to estimate the effectiveness of programs because most countries offer these treatment programs to individuals with a suppressed immune system currently measured as a cd4 count of 350 cells per cubic millimeter cells mm 3 in adults who 2016a at the same time the low program coverages might be related to failure to disclose one s status for fear of discrimination lack of follow up programs after testing positive and availability and affordability of medication the success of the programs is expected to increase drastically with who now recommending that anyone diagnosed with hiv be immediately put on an art program regardless of the cd4 count who 2017b 2016b more infected persons are expected to come out because hiv aids is no longer viewed as a death sentence and a consequence of one s negligent sexual behaviours but a chronic illness that anyone can get through unfortunate circumstances this also implies that more people are bound to freely test for hiv and immediately disclose their status without fear of discrimination a disclosure of one s status has been reported to result in better chances of 100 adherence to the prescribed program nachega et al 2004 the individual becomes free to consume the medication anywhere and anytime they have friends and family to remind them to take the pills when they are away from home 5 environmental concerns currently there is little data on the amount of specific arvs consumed per country yet evidence of successful art programs continues to be published the possibility of massive release of arvs through human excreta that enters surface water through surface runoff and wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluents is of concern the high dosage levels for arvs also requires high production implying that high amounts of arvs are being produced all of which have the potential to make it to environmental water bodies evidence is available in literature indicating that arvs are only partially transformed and become completely excreted from the human body in their original form and or as metabolites in urine and feces table 1 just like any other pharmaceutical arvs can be viewed as pseudo persistent pollutants in the environment because of their continuous release daouk et al 2015 a serious concern relating to presence of arvs in drinking water and food sources is the potential creation of resistant strains of hiv 1 in the body through uninformed exposure to contaminated water arvs are different from other pharmaceuticals in that their therapeutic effect works against a virus that easily transforms into resistant strains if medication is not taken according to prescription this implies that any traces of arvs in food sources and drinking water have more adverse effects to human health than other classes of pharmaceuticals some studies have shown that arvs undergo transformation during treatment of wastewater funke et al 2016 data on the environmental fate and human health impacts of these transformation products is currently less available 5 1 antiretroviral consumption 5 1 1 global antiretroviral consumption currently the amount of specific arvs consumed per epidemiological region is unknown implying that it is difficult to predict or estimate the amount released into the environment we therefore provide a snap view of a global estimate of the amount of arvs consumed and excreted per day using the who recommended atripla combination pill as a reference assuming that the 19 8 million people on art programs in 2016 dataset were using this medication would equate to 21 78 tons of arvs being consumed every day this value would correspond to 3 96 tons of emtricitabine 5 94 tons of tenofovir and 11 88 tons of efavirenz south africa alone with its large art program would have consumed 4 32 tons of the drug combination per day the other countries predicted to would have consumed over a ton of the atripla medication per day are india kenya mozambique zimbabwe nigeria and uganda as shown in table 1 the bioavailability of emtricitabine is 93 implying that of the 3 96 tons of this drug consumed per day 0 277 tons does not enter the blood stream furthermore 86 of the bioavailable fraction corresponding to 3 16 tons is excreted in its original form in urine this implies that a total of 3 44 tons of emtricitabine is released into the environment as part of excreta every day with the earth s surface river water estimated at 2120 km3 us geological survey 2016 this equates to an average global concentration of 1 47 ng l 1 of emtricitabine being released into rivers daily this estimate relates to the only reported emtricitabine concentration of 13 ng l 1 in river water by rimayi et al 2018 as shown in table 3 rimayi et al 2018 furthermore a global consumption of atripla also implies that at least 5 49 tons of tenofovir are being released into the environment daily resulting in an estimated global average of 2 35 ng l 1 in river water in south africa wood et al 2015 have recorded 189 ng l 1 of tenofovir in river water samples as shown in table 3 wood et al 2015 the bioavailability and routes of excretion for efavirenz are still not fully understood the environmental fate of everyday arvs should therefore be of concern to avoid unintentionally exposing the world population to arvs through drinking water and food sources especially in the regions like the sub saharan africa where the hiv aids pandemic is very high 5 1 2 future trends hiv aids has become a global disease with who setting some guidelines and recommendations some of the recommendations by who is the implementation of the treat all initiative of 2016 who 2017b 2016b 2016a who also recommends offer of post exposure prophylaxis pep and pre exposure prophylaxis prep as a risk reduction strategy against hiv transmission who 2016a pep involves receiving treatment after being potentially exposed to hiv regardless of whether you contracted the virus or not recommendations for pep consist mainly of a two drug regimen with zidovudine lamivudine combivir and tenofovir emtricitabine truvada being the preferred combinations tosini et al 2010 young et al 2007 while three drug regimens such as raltegravir tenofovir and emtricitabine have been used mayer et al 2012 prep is a preventive treatment program administered to people at high risk of potentially contracting hiv truvada a combination of tenofovir and emtricitabine is the widely used prep drug combination anderson et al 2011 mccormack et al 2016 plosker 2013 all these initiatives will result in an arv production boom which should become a concern for environmentalists 5 2 pharmacokinetics of antiretroviral drugs the bioavailability values in table 1 indicate that none of the arvs is fully absorbed from the alimentary canal after oral consumption some of these drugs such as didanosine saquinavir tenofovir maraviroc and darunavir are less than 50 bioavailable while the bioavailability studies for most of the drugs is not yet confirmed furthermore the bioavailable fraction is mostly excreted unchanged with a small portion converted to metabolites the impact of these metabolites on the environment and public health has not been fully studied 5 3 fate of antiretrovirals in the environment even though the success of pharmacokinetics of arvs is recent with the first arv drug zidovudine only introduced in 1987 warnke et al 2007 so much progress has been made in understanding their fate once discharged into the environment a study by al rajab et al 2010 has shown that tenofovir is persistent in soils with no evidence of transformation products or microbial based degradation al rajab et al 2010 according to aminot et al 2015 between 5 and 40 of ritonavir has been found to adsorb on suspended solids in a river system aminot et al 2015 hot seasonal conditions led to more ritonavir and other hydrophobic pharmaceuticals partitioning onto solid particulate matter a recent study by aminot et al 2018 has shown that the persistence of some pharmaceuticals including arvs is affected by aerobic physicochemical properties of water aminot et al 2018 the authors observed that abacavir ritonavir lamivudine and saquinavir had half lives of 5 days under biochemical conditions in surface water and wastewater nevirapine and zidovudine were considered very stable even under wwtp processes bagnis et al 2018 observed that effluent dilution factors due to discharge of untreated wastewater into surface water has an impact on the sorption behaviours of pharmaceuticals bagnis et al 2018 the only arv included in this study nevirapine showed its desorptive preference as the untreated effluent enters and becomes diluted by environmental water on the other hand giebułtowicz et al 2017 have observed that the concentration of darunavir only increases downstream before the effluent mixes with water but decreases after mixing giebułtowicz et al 2017 evidence provided by prasse et al 2010 indicated that conventional biological treatment followed by chemical phosphorus removal can substantially remove abacavir 99 lamivudine 76 and stavudine 78 from wastewater while some arvs such as nevirapine and zidovudine can by pass these processes prasse et al 2010 prasse et al 2015 have done laboratory scale studies to show that arvs under environmental conditions undergo both photo and bio transformation processes prasse et al 2015 abacavir zidovudine and emtricitabine were found to preferentially undergo photo transformation while zidovudine was mainly bio transformed these results are an indication that effluents can be held in open systems before release into the rivers this might be a welcome solution especially for developing countries with only the need for longer holding times where light is limited indirect phototransformation can be achieved through addition of quenchers eg n n dimethylaniline to scavenge co3 radicals or photosensitizers eg nano3 nahco3 as a proxie for co3 radicals jaatinen et al 2016 have indicated that zidovudine and nevirapine are 50 reduced during a hygienization process in which source separated urine was stored at 20 c for six months for application as a fertilizer jaatinen et al 2016 lamivudine was reduced by 76 with some transformation products detected but not identified a study by schoeman et al 2017 in south africa has shown that the conventional wastewater treatment processes eliminate up to 94 5 of efavirenz schoeman et al 2017 this was attributed to adsorption on biosolids with the efavirenz sludge concentration as high as 43 mg kg 1 table 3 in their study the persistence of nevirapine 22 5 removal under most wastewater treatment processes was also confirmed the chlorination process used for disinfection of water was also found to enhance the concentration of nevirapine due to deconjugation of its hydroxylated metabolite and lack of binding ability on solid material during the same process efavirenz concentration was increased by only 17 the same behaviour of nevirapine has been reported elsewhere k oreje et al 2016 prasse et al 2010 wood et al 2016 another study in kenya has reported the removal efficiencies of nevirapine 11 49 lamivudine 24 59 efavirenz 83 92 and zidovudine 99 in three wwtps k oreje et al 2016 these observations indicate that some arvs are persistent enough to by pass most wastewater treatment processes and remain in surface water they could eventually make their way to water sources and enter food chains humans can then be exposed through drinking water and food sources like crops vegetables fish and dairy products nevirapine and zidovudine are the most problematic arvs and easily by pass most wastewater treatment processes however none of the articles could link this behavior of nevirapine and zidovudine to their physicochemical properties such as the octanol water partitioning coefficient kow logarithmic acid dissociation constant pka and water solubility the evidence of their presence in surface water systems receiving wastewater effluents is discussed in section 6 1 5 4 human health effects of antiretrovirals while haart regimens have been effective in enhancing the immune system of hiv aids patients and eliminating the physical symptoms associated with the infection the regimens have themselves also manifested side effects with both cutaneous and psychological consequences in most cases the end result is a decline in adherence to therapy leading to regimen failure and drug resistance some reviews have been done on the toxicity of arvs abers et al 2014 carr and cooper 2000 esser et al 2007 hawkins 2010 kong and myers 2005 max and sherer 2000 the present review therefore summarizes the major points from the published reviews as well as those other arvs not mentioned in the previous reviews arvs with extreme side effect cases are given in table 2 generally it is observed that the side effects of most pis are related to the gastrointestinal tract boesecke and cooper 2008 hawkins 2010 the symptoms include diarrhoea nausea and vomiting ritonavir which is utilized as a booster in art has been found to have sensory neurotoxic effects including paraesthesias and altered taste sensations abers et al 2014 markowitz et al 1995 indinavir also exerts lipodystrophy while the major side effect due to amprenavir is rash kong and myers 2005 the nrtis and nnrtis mainly manifest their side effects in the peripheral and central nervous systems respectively in this regard peripheral neuropathy is common with nrtis due to inhibition of mitochondrial dna polymerase abers et al 2014 as such several conditions related to mitochondrial toxicity have been reported for example mitochondrial myopathy due to zidovudine and lactic acidosis due to stavudine and didanosine while the effect is mild with lamivudine emtricitabine abacavir and tenofovir abers et al 2014 brinkman et al 1998 hawkins 2010 venhoff et al 2007 walker et al 2004 in addition nrtis seem to also exert potential lipodystrophy with zidovudine and stavudine confirmed to affect fat redistribution in the body davidson et al 2010 menezes et al 2011 the major symptom is localized loss of fat tissues a condition known as lipoatrophy renal malfunctioning is also common with nrtis such as tenofovir and emtricitabine hamzah et al 2016 schmid et al 2007 solomon et al 2014 on the other hand prominent side effects among nnrtis include hepatotoxicity and rash with nevirapine and efavirenz being the main culprits brück et al 2008 chen et al 2007 hawkins 2010 jamisse et al 2007 kong and myers 2005 sulkowski et al 2002 it should be noted that mild rash has been observed for all pis and some nrtis such as zidovudine as shown in table 2 entry and fusion inhibitors mainly affect the respiratory system with symptoms like coughing pneumonia and fever reported for enfuvirtide and maraviroc they have also been confirmed to cause hypersensitivity syndrome other arvs from other classes with this effect include abacavir chirouze et al 2004 nevirapine hawkins 2010 and delavirdine mills et al 1998 studies on integrase inhibitors have shown that most of the arvs in this class enhance eryptosis the suicidal death of erythrocytes bhuyan et al 2016 bissinger et al 2016 2015 while psychiatric manifestations insomnia suicidality depression and anxiety have recently been reported for dolutegravir fettiplace et al 2017 scheper et al 2018 the most reported side effects in literature are that of the nnrti efavirenz this drug is notable for its central nervous system toxicity as well as potential for risk of psychosis abers et al 2014 funes et al 2014 gaida et al 2015 hawkins 2010 kenedi and goforth 2011 lochet et al 2003 rihs et al 2006 its central nervous system toxicity related symptoms include dizziness drowsiness and neuropsychotic experiences characterized by abnormal dreams hallucinations suicidality anxiety and impaired concentration arvs with risks associated with the cardiovascular system include the pis indinavir and lopinavir and the nrtis abacavir and didanosine the arv with the most hepatotoxicity is nevirapine and as such it is only recommended for patients with cd4 count less than 400 and 250 cells mm 3 for men and women respectively bailey and fisher 2008 cihlar and fordyce 2016 tenofovir has the most adverse effects on the functioning of the renal system davidson et al 2010 fernandez fernandez et al 2011 hawkins 2010 karras et al 2003 and is also reported to demineralize the bones hamzah et al 2016 it is worth mentioning that new arv drugs have been proven to be less toxicity than their predecessors for example atazanavir darunavir and raltegravir are new generation arvs with minimal side effects compared to their predecessors minami and yamamoto 2011 the efficacy of doravirine a new nnrti has been shown to be similar to efavirenz but its impact on the central nervous system is quite low cihlar and fordyce 2016 gatell et al 2014 also tenofovir alafenamide has shown less renal and bone toxicity compared to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate walensky et al 2016 it should be noted that these side effects due to various haart regimens are usually mild to moderate in severity therefore the therapeutic efficacy of arvs against hiv and the resultant improved life expectance far much exceed the reported side effects however knowledge of these potential side effects remains essential considering that the patients have to commit to them for life in cases where the side effects become severe the responsible arv is discontinued and replaced with another of the same class 5 5 ecotoxicological and human health risk assessment several ecotoxicological and human health risk assessment studies have been performed on arvs in environmental samples the ecotoxicological parameters that have been described include the predicted environmental concentration pec and the predicted no effect concentration pnec the pec is an estimation of the concentration of a compound in the environment based on its initial amount released into the environment with considerations of its fate transformation and removal either by artificial or natural means the initial amount released is related to its consumption and excretion data while environmental fate and transformation is based on its physicochemical properties mainly the kow and pka values on the other hand pnec is based on ecotoxicity data and can be defined as the concentration of a compound in the environment below which exposure to that compound will theoretically not cause harmful effects to any biota both the pec and pnec parameters are adopted from the swedish stockholm county council document of 2006 updated in 2010 and have been widely accepted as measures of environmental risk of pharmaceuticals deblonde and hartemann 2013 in some instances predicted critical environmental concentration cec is reported in place of pnec fick et al 2010 the ratio of pec to pnec also called the risk quotient rq is then used to predict the environmental risk of any pharmaceutical the pec pnec ratio or rq value of 0 1 is considered of insignificant risk 0 1 1 of low risk 1 10 of moderate risk and 10 is high risk a retrospective analysis can then be done based on the predictions this approach has been described as a suspect screening approach ferrando climent et al 2016 pochodylo and helbling 2017 the major drawback for these pec pnec ratios is that they are point specific and depend on the specific dosage amounts hence they cannot be used to predict the global toxicity of a particular arv in addition these predictions are dependent on the accuracy of the prescription and consumption datasets while consumption data from a hospital can be reliable it is the prescription data that is biased because it assumes that all the prescribed drugs were consumed another concern is the rigidity of the approach eliminating some pollutants based on predictive models disregards the possibility of formation of degradation products that in some cases have higher toxicity than their parent compounds the ratios also use average yearly consumption values and disregard variations that occur such as population fluctuations due to visits and temporary migrations as is the norm in resort towns and big cities including african towns and cities on an individual scale pec pnec values specific for a particular arv sink can be useful for any organization in deciding which arvs to monitor in their effluents predictive screening of potential ecotoxicity of arvs and any other pharmaceutical is advantageous because it is focused less strenuous and cost effective pharmaceuticals predicted to be of low risk can then be excluded from monitoring programs up until that time when the predicted rq values suggest a potential environmental risk there is evidence in literature showing that most of the arvs were not detected by researchers doing a random analysis abafe et al 2018 peng et al 2014 the predictive models have been used as a basis for investigating presence of arvs and other pharmaceuticals mainly in hospital and wwtp effluents cunningham et al 2009 daouk et al 2015 escher et al 2011 ferrando climent et al 2016 fick et al 2010 helwig et al 2016 k oreje et al 2012 minguez et al 2016 the persistence bioaccumulation and toxicity index pbt index which is a cumulative sum of persistence bioaccumulation and toxicity values each with a 0 3 range has also been used in estimating the ecotoxicological risk assessment of arvs deblonde and hartemann 2013 jean et al 2012 another parameter the margin of exposure moe also based on hospital consumption datasets has been defined by le corre et al 2012 in which a value of 1 indicates no health concern to the human population le corre et al 2012 generally the applicability of these predictive models and others that have been applied as first tier prioritization schemes has been confirmed and discussed in detail by roos et al 2012 roos et al 2012 5 6 risk assessment protocol a critical step in any environmental pollutant analysis is identifying if there are any potential sources of that pollutant that can lead to unintentional introduction into the environment for pollutants of pharmaceutical origin the general approach would be through the prescription dataset route pharmaceuticals such as arvs are intentionally synthesized for their therapeutic properties and given to individuals through a prescription the next step is to understand the environmental fate and eventual ecotoxicological effects the parent compound and its degradation products can then be quantified in different environmental compartments followed by remediation if necessary recently retrospective analysis is preferred in which predictive models discussed in section 5 5 are used to prioritize pharmaceuticals rather than following the expensive and time consuming full scan non targeted analysis fig 4 suggests a general protocol to follow when identifying a pharmaceutical with a potential for ecotoxicity the protocol involves the need to identify all arvs prescribed by a country followed by considerations for arv prescription data for specific communities as well as consumption datasets for hospitals and clinics datasets from these point sources can then be used in predictive screening of the target analytes those arvs with an rq 0 1 can then be prioritized in effluents from wwtps and medical institutions for developed countries where there are strict guidelines for disposal and treatment of effluents monitoring studies can be done while those countries especially africa and the middle east that release untreated or inadequately treated effluents quantitation studies need to be conducted and remediation approaches introduced arvs like any other pharmaceuticals are pseudo persistent and therefore will need to be continuously monitored collection of datasets also needs to be a periodical process since new arvs with better clinical efficacy against hiv are being discovered and introduced into treatment programs it is essential to do risk assessment studies based on community and hospital data separately the advantage is that if there is any need to address the risk the target point source is specific and the measures taken become focused on a smaller amount of wastewater which is cost effective helwig et al 2016 6 determination of antiretrovirals in environmental samples 6 1 current trends the main pathway of arvs into surface water bodies after excretion from the human body is through release of untreated or improperly treated effluents from wwtps hospitals and production facilities from an african context improper sanitation and illegal disposal of both domestic and industrial waste is another potential source of arvs in the environment the list of arvs that have been detected in environmental samples is given in table 3 firstly the results show that the detection of arvs in wwtp effluents and various environmental compartments is recent secondly levels of arvs in environmental water samples in africa are higher than anywhere else this might be related to prevalence of the hiv aids epidemic and the large treatment programs release of untreated or less treated wastewater as well as limited dilution of the effluents due to drought effects low rainfall and high evapotranspiration may be a factor the situation is aggravated by the limited performance of available wastewater treatment processes against pharmaceuticals resulting in release of contaminated effluents to surface water funke et al 2016 the concentration of arvs in surface water bodies of developing countries is expected to increase considering that the countries with high art programs do not have treatment guidelines regarding the presence of pharmaceuticals in wwtp effluents in addition the lack of proper sanitation systems in certain parts of africa could lead to the increase of arvs in surface water due to the direct disposal of fecal matter and urine into the ground which could be carried into the rivers during the rainfall thirdly more research is in the industrialized northern hemisphere where the epidemic is minimal compared to the developing countries madikizela et al 2017 and gwenzi and chaukura 2018 have both observed that analysis of pharmaceuticals in african water samples is generally less compared to other continents with the authors noting lack of advanced analytical instrumentation gwenzi and chaukura 2018 madikizela et al 2017 it is observed that some european researchers have taken african samples for analysis in europe bischel et al 2015 while some have gone as far as doing laboratory scale studies to explain the fate of active pharmaceuticals in untreated effluents of africa and the middle east bagnis et al 2018 these european based results may not necessarily explain the fate of arvs in an african context because of the geochemical and climatic differences between the two hemispheres fourthly zidovudine lamivudine and nevirapine appear prominently in surface water rivers and dams with concentrations as high as 17 410 167 000 and 5620 ng l 1 respectively recorded in kenya k oreje et al 2016 in wwtp effluents these three arvs have been recorded as high as 973 31 070 and 1357 ng l 1 respectively k oreje et al 2016 ngumba et al 2016b wood et al 2015 zidovudine is the most analyzed and detected arv in environmental samples lamivudine has the highest reported concentration in surface water 167 000 ng l 1 recorded in kenya k oreje et al 2016 while efavirenz is highest in wwtp effluents with a value of 34 000 ng l 1 recorded in south africa abafe et al 2018 arvs that have been found in drinking water are zidovudine 72 7 ng l 1 in south africa wood et al 2015 darunavir 3 4 ng l 1 in poland giebułtowicz et al 2017 and lamivudine 27 73 ng l 1 in the usa furlong et al 2017 carboxylated transformation products of abacavir emtricitabine and lamivudine 80 41 84 ng l 1 respectively have also been detected in german drinking water funke et al 2016 6 2 ecotoxicological effects in non human species not much has been done in understanding the ecotoxicity of arvs in non target species such as aquatic organisms and plants especially those species that are a source of food to humans abacavir has been found to be harmful to green algae with an ec50 value of 57 mg l 1 while it was less toxic to the other study organisms crustcean and diatom with ec50 values all reported as greater than 100 mg l 1 minguez et al 2016 this is worrying considering that green algae are the main primary producers in aquatic ecosystems ngumba et al 2016a b have calculated rq values for aquatic life and found that zidovudine and nevirapine had potential ecotoxicological effects on algae daphnia and fish with algae being the most affected ngumba et al 2016a lamivudine did not display any ecotoxicity towards these aquatic species robson et al 2017 have shown that a concentration of efavirenz as low as 10 3 ng l 1 has serious health effects on oreochromis mossambicus fish robson et al 2017 a review by guo et al 2015 observed that the ecotoxicological exposure risk of arvs towards algae due to human use is insignificant guo et al 2015 their ecotoxicity data only addressed a european situation where the hiv aids pandemic and the concentration of arvs in wwtp effluents is very small compared to the african story 6 3 sampling for antiretroviral analysis it is observed that most sampling methods used do not address the possibility of short term arv variations the common approach reported in most articles is grab sampling within a treatment plant or at different positions of a river system and dams it is of the authors view that considerations for sampling times and frequency of sampling are important in arv analysis arvs are taken at specific prescribed times of the day for the rest of the person s life implying that there are certain times that the arv levels in water systems are very high in addition ort et al 2010 have identified sampling errors related to long sampling intervals and inadequate sampling modes as contributors to overinterpretation of pharmaceutical ecotoxicological data ort et al 2010 solutions to these errors and biases can be the design of predictive models and also consideration for passive sampling approaches automated samplers and online sensors wooding et al 2017 have also developed a low cost disposable sorptive sampling loop made of polydimethylsiloxane for selective extraction of pharmaceuticals including arvs from water samples wooding et al 2017 6 4 extraction and isolation techniques understanding the fate of pharmaceutical drugs requires appropriately validated analytical techniques that can efficiently extract the low concentration analytes that also exist as mixtures with other organics with related physicochemical properties from high matrix samples since environmental samples are complex in addition to pharmaceutical pollutants existing in trace levels there is always need for isolation and preconcentration before chromatographic quantitation the current approaches for analysis of arvs in aqueous samples are mainly through solid phase extraction spe table 3 for solid samples microwave assisted extraction followed by spe aminot et al 2015 and sonication and quechers schoeman et al 2017 have been reported the performance of these techniques is summarized in table 3 most of the spe methods listed in table 3 use the waters oasis hydrophilic lipophilic balance oasis hlb cartridges this spe sorbent is listed in the us epa method 1694 for analysis of pharmaceuticals in environmental samples other reported spe adsorbents are isolute env prasse et al 2010 cleanert pep schoeman et al 2017 lichrolut en rp18 margot et al 2013 bond elut plexa rimayi et al 2018 and the waters oasis mcx aminot et al 2016 2015 some studies have combined oasis hlb with isolute env sorbents bischel et al 2015 kovalova et al 2012 while ibáñez et al 2017 have used an spe cartridge containing stratax strata wax strata wcx and isoluteenv ibáñez et al 2017 generally the oasis hlb cartridges have been proven to perform better than other sorbents when doing a simultaneous analysis of pharmaceuticals ngumba et al 2016b this could be due to its ability to extract a group of chemicals from environmental samples that differ in chemical properties in addition loss of arvs has been observed for some cartridges including 53 63 and 44 reported for abacavir nevirapine and zidovudine respectively using a waters oasis mcx spe sorbent aminot et al 2015 this implies that the oasis hlb remains the spe sorbent of choice in the analysis of arvs molecularly imprinted polymers mips have come of age and have also been reported in the analysis of abacavir in environmental samples terzopoulou et al 2016 the mip in this study had a binding affinity of 149 mg g 1 another mip reported for abacavir but not applied in real samples had a binding capacity of 157 mg g 1 chianella et al 2006 limited applications for the mip adsorbents for the extraction of arvs could be due to their non commercial availability in addition arvs are simultaneously detected in the environment whereas mips are easily synthesized for single analytes as such mips for arvs have only been applied in the analysis of abacavir 6 5 analytical instrumentation and detection techniques fast instrumentation with sensitive detectors is needed to monitor pharmaceuticals including arvs and their transformation products in complex environmental samples liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry lc ms is the most used in analysis of pharmaceuticals as such it was observed that the literature reporting arvs in this review mainly used uhplc esi qtof ms table 3 while the lc linear ion trap ltq orbitrap ms prasse et al 2015 has also been reported generally lc esi hrms has the ability of detecting these pharmaceuticals in the ng l 1 scale as shown in table 3 both the qtof and orbitrap are characterized by high mass accuracy and resolution with the ability to identify isotopic abundance ibáñez et al 2017 for a retrospective analysis the spectral noise is removed leaving only the data related to the target analytes another advantage of lc esi hrms is the ability to detect and confirm the presence of compounds whose reference standards are not available in the market new arvs with better therapeutic efficiency are constantly being introduced to replace those that are already in use hrms then becomes important in the environmental analysis of the discontinued arvs and those that did not pass the clinical trial stage an spe hplc dad method for determination of lamivudine nevirapine and zidovudine in urine samples has also been reported pynnönen and tuhkanen 2014 this method had unfavorable method detection limit values of 71 1610 μg l 1 which could limit its applicability in natural water where arvs are present in the ng l 1 scale 7 remediation of antiretrovirals in the environment remediation studies on some arvs through exposing them to controlled biochemical processes have been reported in literature an et al 2011 have described a photocatalytic decontamination mechanism of lamivudine using tio2 as a catalyst an et al 2011 in their study they identified six non toxic hydroxylated derivatives which were further mineralized completely within 6 h into co2 h2o so4 2 no3 and nh3 nh4 in a study reported by prasse et al 2015 abacavir was shown to form a stable carboxy abacavir by product under normal environmental conditions while lamivudine emtricitabine and zidovudine were finally mineralized and taken up by microbes prasse et al 2015 funke et al 2016 have investigated the degradation kinetics for arvs during biological treatment of wastewater in germany funke et al 2016 their results showed that the arvs undergo rapid biotransformation through oxidation of the terminal hydroxyl group and the thioether group if present to carboxy transformation products in their study abacavir emtricitabine ganciclovir lamivudine and zidovudine were detected in influents while their carboxy transformation products were the major components in effluents after biotransformation conversion rates reported ranged from 53 for zidovudine to 99 for abacavir these transformation products are stable under environmental conditions and were therefore also detected in surface water bodies receiving the treated effluents as well as in drinking water the ecotoxicity of these transformation products has not yet been reported only zidovudine could be detected in these samples confirming its stability against treatment processes ozonation and activated carbon were effective in eliminating the transformation products from drinking water the ozonation products were not identified while some of these transformation products are more toxic than their parent compounds funke et al 2016 they are expected to have reduced activity against the virus this is an area that needs serious consideration because it can either be a welcome relief or a nightmare in as far as production of resistant strains is concerned abafe et al 2018 have recently reported that the conventional anaerobic digestion of wastewater followed by chlorination led to over 99 removal of abacavir lamivudine and zidovudine from effluents while atazanavir efavirenz lopinavir and nevirapine remained persistent abafe et al 2018 however the transformation products were not identified wood et al 2016 have shown the persistence of nevirapine under chlorination of water wood et al 2016 chlorination is the most common method for disinfecting water for drinking processes in developing countries also chlorination is the final step of wastewater treatment process in most countries in their study several transformation products were characterized the characterization results showed that some of these by products had antiviral properties and also existed in surface water samples receiving wastewater effluents other interesting results from this study was the observation that nevirapine was more degraded through chlorination at high ph conditions than in acidic conditions under simulated wastewater matrix only 5 of nevirapine was degraded kovalova et al 2012 have shown in a pilot study that a membrane bioreactor eliminates up to 78 of ritonavir kovalova et al 2012 mccurry et al 2014 have demonstrated the performance of an anaerobic fluidized membrane bioreactor against activated carbon under aerobic carbon for abacavir emtricitabine and lamivudine mccurry et al 2014 the removal values through the bioreactor were 100 63 and 99 respectively some of these metabolites such as the carboxy abacavir have been confirmed to form during metabolism of arvs in the body cihlar and ray 2010 zhou et al 2015 have shown that photolysis of arvs lamivudine and zidovudine as test compounds is enhanced by presence of nitrates under normal environmental conditions zhou et al 2015 in their study high levels of dissolved organic matter also enhanced the photodegradation of lamivudine while the effect was inhibitory for zidovudine the transformation products were not determined degradation products of lamivudine bedse et al 2009 and tenofovir kurmi et al 2015 due to hydrolysis under both acidic and alkaline condition were also characterized margot et al 2013 have shown that the removal rate of ritonavir under nitrification activated sludge and ozonation was 25 56 and 78 respectively margot et al 2013 wang et al 2010 have shown that iron carbon micro electrolysis can remove up to 90 of lamivudine in wastewater wang et al 2010 the same approach has been shown in another study in which 85 of zidovudine was removed from pharmaceutical wastewater li et al 2011 advanced wastewater treatment technologies that are known to remove some pharmaceutical residues such as ozonation activated carbon and biodegradation are expensive for key populations in developing countries 8 challenges available data provides evidence that current wastewater treatment processes are not able to eliminate arvs from water implying that large amounts of arvs are released into the environment in addition unesco has stated that over 80 of the global wastewater is discharged into the environment without any form of treatment unesco 2017 arvs like any other pharmaceutical drug might be introduced into the environment in the nanogram per litre concentration but data is lacking on the prolonged human exposure since arvs are considered as pseudo persistent pollutants very few studies have provided ecotoxicity data in non target species like fish and vegetables all of which form part of a human diet bioaccumulation and trophic magnification of arvs have not yet been investigated too the scarcity of water and lack of proper sanitation especially in drought stricken areas results in elevated concentration of pharmaceuticals in water bodies this is a dire situation especially for communities that use unprocessed water from these water bodies for drinking and irrigation purposes most retrospective studies have been done on public hospitals datasets from private hospitals are not readily accessible while data collection from developing countries is a very difficult task new arvs and arv combinations are also being discovered while more are still in their clinical development for example dolutegravir has been developed as a robust cost effective substitute for efavirenz while tenofovir alafenamide is replacing tenofovir disoproxil fumarate barnhart and shelton 2015 clercq 2016 mills et al 2016 vitoria et al 2017 the evidence of efficacy of lower arv concentrations such as that of efavirenz 400 mg versus the conventional 600 mg prescription vitoria et al 2017 is an indication that there is reason to be worried of presence of arvs in food sources including drinking water in addition using hospital consumption data results in underestimation of pecs because arvs are taken for life and more likely to be found in domestic waste than hospital effluents with who promoting treat all and prophylaxis programs there is a possibility of production of arv drugs becoming a global thing to improve accessibility and affordability while in developed countries effluents from factories undergo strict guidelines this becomes a concern in low and medium income countries where there is a possibility of unmonitored release of contaminated effluents into surface water bodies most wwtps have not yet been upgraded or evaluated for the capacity to eliminate pharmaceuticals including arvs this implies that there is still a global denial among municipalities that there is direct deposition of pharmaceuticals into surface water through disposal of improperly treated wastewater effluents for impoverished communities with poor sanitation surface runoff is of concern as a vector of arv contamination because it directly deposits arvs in their original form unlike wwtp effluents in which the medication undergoes some form of degradation another serious concern is that while art programs successfully revive one s health they do not eliminate the virus with the infected looking more health than the uninfected kaler et al 2016 this inability to differentiate is a social danger because more are bound to have unprotected sex based on one s physical appearance leading to more infections the current risk assessment parameters that have been reported for fate of arvs in the environment are not exhaustive and lack the description of possibility of development of resistant hiv strains due to presence of trace levels of arvs in drinking water and food sources risk assessment studies experimental or predictive for arvs cannot be simplified under other pharmaceuticals because their exposure has extreme consequences in the body as it relates to the drug s future therapeutic efficacy against the virus declarations based on predictive pec pnec and rqs may not hold for arvs considering that their presence in the body relate to the virus tendency to develop resistance arvs are highly specific drugs and are expected to exert their impact even at very low environmental concentrations general questions for consideration may include does presence of any trace level of an arv taken orally and unintentionally with food or drinking water alone or in combination with others have an effect on the viral behavior in the body it is predicted that the available data on the adverse health effects of arvs summarized in section 5 4 is not as important as their enhanced ability to trigger production of resistant strains that can no longer be controlled using the same drug considering that this only occurs if the drug is not taken according to prescription human exposure to arvs becomes a serious concern for public health there is a possibility that arv contamination might exceed the maximum permissible intake as a measure of amount exposed per unit body mass before a true cure for hiv is found this might also hinder scientists in finding a true cure for hiv because as the drug goes through clinical trials it gets released to the environment exposing the population the end result is a reduced pool of arvs for people living with hiv aids and also a possibility of the working regimens to be effective for reduced times the possibility of drug drug interactions once a patient on arv medication is exposed to a pollutant drug needs serious consideration continuous exposure might result in dosage additive or synergistic effects evidence is available for intra class drug enhancement while some studies have confirmed that transformation products follow the same pharmacokinetic pathways implying that exposure results in reduced efficacy of the prescribed regimen cihlar and ray 2010 in addition cyp3a inhibitors such as cobicistat are not recommended for regimens consumed at least twice a day because they may result in unexpected deviations in efficacy of the other arvs exposure to such arvs through contaminated food sources is of concern the studies on sewer treatment transformations is necessary as it can afford researchers to select stable byproducts and use them as biomarkers that can be identified using mass spectrometry reid et al 2014 however the idea of biomarkers has its own challenges such as concentrations below the method detection limit and the potential existence of other compounds that give the same target biomarker resulting in overestimation of the extent of release of the parent compound into the environment another instrumental challenge is the observation that the limit of detection values for some pharmaceuticals are well above their pnec values implying that it becomes difficult to evaluate their ecotoxicities which we believe is the case with the ecotoxicity of arvs there is therefore a need for considering the detection limit of the extraction method used before declaring a pharmaceutical not present in the environment orias and perrodin 2013 9 future perspectives considering that quite a number of arvs are available which differ according to region there is need for more point specific prediction data on risk potential to allow each community to prioritize targeted arvs this has been observed in developed countries and the concern lies with african countries where studies have mainly focused on randomized analysis versus targeted monitoring based on predictive screening methodologies most european countries have initiated country based environmental risk ranking studies of pharmaceuticals based on consumption datasets available from hospital consumptions and community prescriptions however the datasets on daily arv consumption is still limited especially for african countries with large arv programs implying that environmental risk assessment predictions cannot be reliably modelled in this regard it is observed that most pec and pnec predictions are done for european countries making monitoring and consumption data available will help in better understanding the ecotoxicological risks associated with presence of arvs in the environment and to determine what measures to take to address that risk at point source level expensive but effective treatment technologies can then be considered on point sources where the arvs have very high pec values there is need for considerations for removal of arvs and other pharmaceuticals through optimizing the existing technologies in wwtps or introducing new technologies alternatively the approach can be source control where biodegradability becomes essential or considerations for urine source separation technologies such as the nomix toilets escher et al 2011 especially in less developed areas imparted by the hiv aids pandemic such as southern african countries there is also a need for serious considerations for exposure effects in treatment experienced patients eg perinatal infected adolescents patients already resistant to the drug patients in which the drug is not yet in their prescription list as well as patients based on age extent of viral load and the general public at large arv regimens are also age specific and biased towards certain individuals such as pregnant women implying that the risk assessment studies need to be specific prediction values are based on consumption and prescription data and excretion rates but disregard biodegradability and bioaccumulation of target compounds orias and perrodin 2013 there is need for considerations of metabolites and transformation products in order to have a realistic understanding of the fate of arvs in the environment and their potential ecotoxicity with most of the transformation products of arvs unknown the environmental impact of arvs remains a research challenge for environmental analysts more research on impact of wwtp effluents is needed especially from the countries with high art programs it is observed that south africa and kenya have made significant progress in the analysis of arvs in their surface water bodies most health risk assessment studies are confined in the western world while the developing countries have focused on quantitation to provide evidence of presence in water bodies the analysis of pharmaceuticals from an african context is fast growing with several review articles including this one being used as a tool for aggravating researchers from this part of the world to stand up and serve the continent from a potential catastrophe it is also observed that most studies on the presence of arvs in african waters are conducted in urban areas however there is a high population of hiv infected people residing in rural areas where there are no proper sanitation systems people in most rural areas depend on untreated river water as the only source of drinking water which is also shared with their animals such as pigs etc that are used as food sources due to droughts and scarcity of rainfalls especially in winter the water level in the rivers become too low which could result in pre concentration of pollutants that include arvs therefore the monitoring programs should be extended to rural communities where people go to the nearest bush for excretion of the body waste which is usually washed off to small rivers if not eaten by animals food sources with the biotransformation and sorptive nature of most arvs unknown in silico studies can be a useful tool in predicting the in sewer fate of these pharmaceuticals software that predicts metabolic pathways of arvs including any other pharmaceuticals whose data is still not readily available is now available such as the meteor lhasa ltd leeds uk and smartcyp university of copenhagen reid et al 2014 several programs listed in the usepa s estimation programs interface epi suite can also be used to predict the kinetics of a compound during sewer treatment and under normal environmental conditions in the absence of experimental data usepa 2012 these include the ecological structure activity relationships ecosar sanderson et al 2004 thomaidi et al 2015 the sistema de tratamento de ponto stpwin and the biological biowin model reid et al 2014 the ecosar model utilizes the kow values to estimate aquatic toxicity while the stpwin and biowin models predict half lives as a function of the sorptive nature and biodegradability of the compound respectively transformation products can also be predicted in silico using models such as the university of minnesota pathway prediction system um pps and the catabolism software catabol bletsou et al 2015 the ecotoxicological risk associated with combinational disposal of arvs needs to be modelled cumulative synergy or additivity when the arvs co exist in the environment also in the presence of matrix effects is another area that needs serious consideration during ecotoxicological studies while each drug may exist within the predicted no effect concentration mixture effect due to same type of arvs with the same mode of action against the virus may lead to synergic or additive impact against the virus previous studies have confirmed concentration addition for pharmaceuticals from the same therapeutic class escher et al 2011 kamba et al 2017 evidence is available in literature that show that some arvs experience drug drug interactions amongst themselves and also with other classes of pharmaceuticals golla et al 2016 kurmi et al 2016a 2016b kurmi and singh 2017 warnke et al 2007 welzen et al 2011 for example solid state stress studies done on several arv pairs have shown that their co existence in the environment results in interaction products in addition to their pre known transformation products golla et al 2016 kurmi et al 2016a 2016b kurmi and singh 2017 it has also been found that efavirenz and nevirapine may require dosage modification in patients also taking anticonvulsants warnke et al 2007 the same authors also list those drugs that should not be co administered with certain protease inhibitors finally the authors also emphasize the need to consider analysis of arvs in aquatic species soils and sediments as this is another area with limited ecotoxicological data related to the presence of arvs in the environment such species and sediments can be those directly linked to aquatic environments that receive effluents from wwtp agricultural soils ameliorated with biosolids as well as vegetables and crops grown under organic fertilized land can be another area of interest plant toxicity as well as phytoremediation of arvs is another topic that could be exciting to researchers 10 conclusions so much progress has been achieved in understanding hiv aids pandemic and the therapeutic efficacy of arvs to the extent that the disease can be viewed as a normal disease that anyone can have and freely disclose his positive status the environmental concerns associated with unmonitored release of arvs into surface water has led to researchers doing studies in order to have a better understanding of their fate and ecotoxicological effects once released into the environment currently the datasets are limited but evidence shows that the research on the presence of arvs in environmental samples is on a rise arvs are a special group of pharmaceuticals and a deviation from their prescription dosages results in the development of resistant strains of the virus thus more analysis and monitoring datasets are needed urgently to prevent exposing the human population through contaminated water and food sources especially for developing countries where the hiv aids epidemic is at its highest funding this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not for profit sectors 
19286,the therapeutic efficacy of antiretroviral drugs as well as challenges and side effects against the human immunodeficiency virus is well documented and reviewed evidence is available in literature indication that antiretrovirals are only partially transformed and become completely excreted from the human body in their original form and or as metabolites in urine and feces the possibility of massive release of antiretrovirals through human excreta that enters surface water through surface runoff and wastewater treatment plant effluents is now of environmental concern because the public might be experiencing chronic exposure to antiretrovirals the primary concern of this review is limited data concerning environmental fate and ecotoxicity of antiretrovirals and their metabolites the review aims to provide a comprehensive insight into the evaluation of antiretrovirals in environmental samples the objective is therefore to assess the extent of analysis of antiretrovirals in environmental samples and also look at strategies including instrumentation and predictive models that have been reported in literature on the fate and ecotoxicological effects due to presence of antiretrovirals in different environmental compartments the review also looks at current challenges and offers possible areas of exploration that could help minimize the presence of antiretrovirals in the environment graphical abstract image keywords antiretrovirals hiv aids antiretroviral combination therapy predicted environmental concentration predicted no effect concentration environmental samples 1 introduction antiretroviral drugs arvs are medications used in the treatment of retroviral infections primarily human immunodeficiency virus type 1 hiv 1 hiv 1 is a virus that attacks mainly the cd4 t cells responsible for the body s immune system however antiretroviral treatment against hiv 1 does not cure or kill the virus but rather prevents or slows down its multiplication deeks et al 2013 once the blood viral load has been suppressed to below detection limits minimal or no further damage is done on the immune system this leads to an improvement in one s health fewer opportunistic infections and a prolonged life expectance the impact of an antiretroviral treatment against hiv 1 can be categorized into four the virological purpose in which the target is to reduce the viral load the immunological purpose in which the target is to improve the immune system the therapeutical purpose in which the target is to reduce side effects symptoms and opportunistic infections as well as the epidemiological purpose where the target is to prevent hiv 1 transmission from one person to another the inability of arvs to completely eradicate hiv 1 from the body implies that a dormant reservoir of infected memory t cells persists in the body of an infected person the virus resurfaces and replicates itself when these latent t cells are used to replace old cd4 cells thus the victims are required to take arv medication for the rest of their lives to suppress its multiplication the current public health concerns of arv therapy have mainly focused on side effects long term consumption effects and development as well as transmission of resistant viral strains due to drug drug interferences non adherence and inconsistence in prescribed dosages carr and cooper 2000 cihlar and fordyce 2016 esté and cihlar 2010 fisher et al 2006 hawkins 2010 linnemayr and stecher 2015 who 2017a another burning issue has been the fear of introducing new drugs to communities based on small scale clinical tests vitoria et al 2017 the environmental fate and the impact of presence of arvs in drinking water and food sources is still yet to be fully reviewed jain et al 2013 have reviewed the occurrence and removal of antivirals with an emphasis on the influenza drugs acyclovir and oseltamivir jain et al 2013 esté and cihlar 2010 have focused on arv efficacy esté and cihlar 2010 while warnke et al 2007 and temesgen et al 2006 have done arv therapeutic reviews temesgen et al 2006 warnke et al 2007 generally a few pharmaceutical review articles report partially on the presence and fate of arvs in environmental samples gwenzi and chaukura 2018 jain et al 2013 madikizela et al 2017 yang et al 2017 for example in a review article presented by madikizela et al 2017 the primary focus was on the occurrence of a wide variety of pharmaceuticals in african water bodies with arvs only mentioned in passing in view of the scope mentioned above we have identified a gap in the total understanding of the presence of arvs in various environmental compartments we therefore seek to provide a compressive insight into the environmental fate and ecotoxicological effect of arvs as a special branch of pharmaceuticals while the arv therapy which is currently freely available to every human being has greatly improved lives of people living with hiv aids with probabilistic hiv aids pandemic projections indicating a big drop in casualties in a few years to come sharrow et al 2017 the extent of release of these drugs through excretion and disposal of unused or expired medication needs to be considered overall the aim of the present work was to critically review the current worldwide status on the environmental monitoring and fate as well as ecotoxicological effects of arvs the overview of antiretroviral treatment programs and global consumption rates of arvs are reviewed with the intention of pointing out the importance of their analysis in the environment furthermore based on studies reported in literature the conclusions were drawn and future perspectives are discussed in the present review 2 types of antiretroviral drugs there are basically six classes of arvs depending on their molecular mechanism and resistance profiles mode of action arts and hazuda 2012 each class refers to the phase of the retrovirus life cycle targeted by the drug bailey and fisher 2008 these classes and their mode of action are summarized in table 1 the replication cycle of hiv is well documented arts and hazuda 2012 temesgen et al 2006 warnke et al 2007 the nucleoside nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors nrtis are considered the backbone of hiv treatment because they act early in the replication viral cycle by preventing reverse transcription of the viral rna into its dna an essential step before the virus could integrate itself into the host cell this is achieved by interfering with a viral enzyme responsible for this purpose called reverse transcriptase the protease inhibitors pis target the virus during reproduction of an infected cell lv et al 2015 these inhibitors act by preventing the latent hiv dna from fragmenting into components required for producing hiv rna strands they block the viral protease enzyme the pi ritonavir has a further advantage of enhancing the systematic exposure of other pis and as such is now preferred as a booster for other arvs in combination therapy abers et al 2014 boesecke and cooper 2008 entry inhibitors act by preventing the virus from attaching to a body cell the integrase inhibitors act by preventing the insertion of the viral dna into the dna of the body cell they target the hiv integrase enzyme cytochrome p450 3a inhibitors are not anti retrovirals but rather act as pharmacokinetic enhancers of other arvs this is achieved by inhibiting cytochrome p450 3a isoforms responsible for metabolizing arvs the increased efficacy of arvs then becomes an advantage in terms of dosage amounts and potential for side effects 3 antiretroviral combination therapy one of the major challenges in understanding hiv is its inability to proofread the enzymes responsible for reverse transcription from its rna to dna this results in multiple mutant viral offspring some of these mutants become genetically superior to the parent virus through natural selection and become resistant to the body s immune system as well as arvs the target therefore is to reduce the viral load as quickly as possible so as to minimize the probability of producing resistant strains this is achieved by preventing viral replication at its different stages of development through combination antiretroviral therapy cart passaes and sáez cirión 2014 the idea of cart is that if one mutant becomes resistant to a particular drug the other drugs in the combination cocktail continue to suppress replication of that mutant the common trend is to use two nrtis as a backbone in combination with one of the drugs from other classes especially an nnrti or a pi cihlar and fordyce 2016 lennox et al 2009 this triple combination also referred to as highly active antiretroviral therapy haart has proved to be an effective cocktail against the virus the effectiveness of these carts against mutants depends on the adherence and consistence of taking the prescribed medication the choice of combination therapy depends on various factors including the viral load the patient s cd4 count age tolerability and availability of arvs some companies have developed single drug formats with fixed dose combinations these include atripla and complera both of which consist of two nrtis emtricitabine and tenofovir and one nnrti efavirenz for atripla and rilpivine for complera other triple drug combination pills include trizivir an all nrti regimen pill consisting of abacavir zidovudine and lamivudine as well as triumeq which consists of two nrtis abacavir and lamivudine and an integrase inhibitor dolutegravir some combination single dosage pills consist of four arvs these include stribild and genvoya both of which consist of emtricitabine nrti tenofovir nrti elvitegravir integrase inhibitor and cobicistat pharmacokinetic enhancer the common single drug formats with two arvs are combivir lamivudine and zidovudine epzicom abacavir lamivudine and truvada tenofovir emtricitabine other two drug pills include the protease inhibitor pharmacokinetic enhancer combinations such as evotaz atazanavir and cobicistat and prezcobix darunavir and cobicistat the main advantage of fixed dose combination pills is reduction in pill burden while at the same time ensuring adherence to prescription cihlar and ray 2010 these single pill regimens are mainly recommended for persons who just tested positive and the virus has not yet caused complications to the immune system even though there are several combination therapies who has recommended atripla a fixed dose combination regimen pill consisting of tenofovir efavirenz and emtricitabine as a starter for anyone recently diagnosed with hiv who 2016a in cases where efavirenz causes side effects nevirapine is usually used as a substitute even though triple therapy has ensured that viral multiplication and its probability of developing drug resistance is greatly reduced the success of a combination treatment regimen remains complex the combination components may need to be taken separately at specific times every day either after or before meals deviations from these prescribed specifications will result in the virus quickly developing resistance to the drug combination studies have shown that a mere 5 deviation may cause the regimen to drop its effectiveness against the virus to 81 at 70 treatment commitment the effectiveness drops to a mere 6 furthermore a change in drug composition of the treatment regimen is required throughout the life of a person living with hiv implying that the patient has to be committed to ensure adherence to the treatment program 4 global status of hiv aids 4 1 hiv aids epidemiology according to the who global health observatory data repository there was an estimated 36 7 million people living with hiv aids by end of 2016 dataset of these cases 70 were from africa 10 in the south east asia 9 in the americas 6 in europe 4 in the western pacific and only 1 was in the eastern mediterranean fig 1 shows all the countries that had over 100 000 reported cases of hiv in 2016 african countries contribute 60 of the listed countries south africa alone had a massive 7 1 million of its population estimated to be hiv positive this was more than twice that of nigeria whose hiv aids prevalence is the second worst in africa and estimated at 3 2 million considering the percentage of infected persons as a ratio of a country s population swaziland had the highest percentage ratio of people living with hiv aids estimated at 22 of its total population fig 2 shows all the countries with at least 0 5 of its population infected with hiv in 2016 based on the data presented in fig 2 16 african countries were leading in the top 50 countries with the highest population percentage of people living with hiv aids in 2016 sub saharan africa is the most affected region with all the nine countries having 5 or more of their population coming from this region 4 2 antiretroviral treatment programs the global estimate of people receiving arv treatment as of 2016 was 19 8 million fig 3 shows that south africa had the biggest antiretroviral treatment art program estimated at 3 9 million people receiving arvs this value is at least 4 times the number of any other art program in the world and equates to about 24 of the world art program even though south africa india and kenya are the only countries with over a million of patients in their treatment programs fig 3 this only contributes 56 49 and 64 of the infected individuals respectively in those countries nigeria has the second highest number of people living with hiv aids yet only 30 were on art programs in 2016 figs 1 and 3 the countries with the most effective programs in terms of number of people under treatment compared to the number infected are australia 90 sweden and botswana 83 rwanda italy cambodia and switzerland all 80 the other countries with more than three quarters of its infected population on art programs in the year 2016 were swaziland 79 france 78 spain and ireland 77 algeria 76 and zimbabwe 75 swaziland has a roller coaster hiv aids story in that it has the highest hiv aids prevalence and also one of the most successful art programs however these statistics on national art programs cannot be used entirely to estimate the effectiveness of programs because most countries offer these treatment programs to individuals with a suppressed immune system currently measured as a cd4 count of 350 cells per cubic millimeter cells mm 3 in adults who 2016a at the same time the low program coverages might be related to failure to disclose one s status for fear of discrimination lack of follow up programs after testing positive and availability and affordability of medication the success of the programs is expected to increase drastically with who now recommending that anyone diagnosed with hiv be immediately put on an art program regardless of the cd4 count who 2017b 2016b more infected persons are expected to come out because hiv aids is no longer viewed as a death sentence and a consequence of one s negligent sexual behaviours but a chronic illness that anyone can get through unfortunate circumstances this also implies that more people are bound to freely test for hiv and immediately disclose their status without fear of discrimination a disclosure of one s status has been reported to result in better chances of 100 adherence to the prescribed program nachega et al 2004 the individual becomes free to consume the medication anywhere and anytime they have friends and family to remind them to take the pills when they are away from home 5 environmental concerns currently there is little data on the amount of specific arvs consumed per country yet evidence of successful art programs continues to be published the possibility of massive release of arvs through human excreta that enters surface water through surface runoff and wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluents is of concern the high dosage levels for arvs also requires high production implying that high amounts of arvs are being produced all of which have the potential to make it to environmental water bodies evidence is available in literature indicating that arvs are only partially transformed and become completely excreted from the human body in their original form and or as metabolites in urine and feces table 1 just like any other pharmaceutical arvs can be viewed as pseudo persistent pollutants in the environment because of their continuous release daouk et al 2015 a serious concern relating to presence of arvs in drinking water and food sources is the potential creation of resistant strains of hiv 1 in the body through uninformed exposure to contaminated water arvs are different from other pharmaceuticals in that their therapeutic effect works against a virus that easily transforms into resistant strains if medication is not taken according to prescription this implies that any traces of arvs in food sources and drinking water have more adverse effects to human health than other classes of pharmaceuticals some studies have shown that arvs undergo transformation during treatment of wastewater funke et al 2016 data on the environmental fate and human health impacts of these transformation products is currently less available 5 1 antiretroviral consumption 5 1 1 global antiretroviral consumption currently the amount of specific arvs consumed per epidemiological region is unknown implying that it is difficult to predict or estimate the amount released into the environment we therefore provide a snap view of a global estimate of the amount of arvs consumed and excreted per day using the who recommended atripla combination pill as a reference assuming that the 19 8 million people on art programs in 2016 dataset were using this medication would equate to 21 78 tons of arvs being consumed every day this value would correspond to 3 96 tons of emtricitabine 5 94 tons of tenofovir and 11 88 tons of efavirenz south africa alone with its large art program would have consumed 4 32 tons of the drug combination per day the other countries predicted to would have consumed over a ton of the atripla medication per day are india kenya mozambique zimbabwe nigeria and uganda as shown in table 1 the bioavailability of emtricitabine is 93 implying that of the 3 96 tons of this drug consumed per day 0 277 tons does not enter the blood stream furthermore 86 of the bioavailable fraction corresponding to 3 16 tons is excreted in its original form in urine this implies that a total of 3 44 tons of emtricitabine is released into the environment as part of excreta every day with the earth s surface river water estimated at 2120 km3 us geological survey 2016 this equates to an average global concentration of 1 47 ng l 1 of emtricitabine being released into rivers daily this estimate relates to the only reported emtricitabine concentration of 13 ng l 1 in river water by rimayi et al 2018 as shown in table 3 rimayi et al 2018 furthermore a global consumption of atripla also implies that at least 5 49 tons of tenofovir are being released into the environment daily resulting in an estimated global average of 2 35 ng l 1 in river water in south africa wood et al 2015 have recorded 189 ng l 1 of tenofovir in river water samples as shown in table 3 wood et al 2015 the bioavailability and routes of excretion for efavirenz are still not fully understood the environmental fate of everyday arvs should therefore be of concern to avoid unintentionally exposing the world population to arvs through drinking water and food sources especially in the regions like the sub saharan africa where the hiv aids pandemic is very high 5 1 2 future trends hiv aids has become a global disease with who setting some guidelines and recommendations some of the recommendations by who is the implementation of the treat all initiative of 2016 who 2017b 2016b 2016a who also recommends offer of post exposure prophylaxis pep and pre exposure prophylaxis prep as a risk reduction strategy against hiv transmission who 2016a pep involves receiving treatment after being potentially exposed to hiv regardless of whether you contracted the virus or not recommendations for pep consist mainly of a two drug regimen with zidovudine lamivudine combivir and tenofovir emtricitabine truvada being the preferred combinations tosini et al 2010 young et al 2007 while three drug regimens such as raltegravir tenofovir and emtricitabine have been used mayer et al 2012 prep is a preventive treatment program administered to people at high risk of potentially contracting hiv truvada a combination of tenofovir and emtricitabine is the widely used prep drug combination anderson et al 2011 mccormack et al 2016 plosker 2013 all these initiatives will result in an arv production boom which should become a concern for environmentalists 5 2 pharmacokinetics of antiretroviral drugs the bioavailability values in table 1 indicate that none of the arvs is fully absorbed from the alimentary canal after oral consumption some of these drugs such as didanosine saquinavir tenofovir maraviroc and darunavir are less than 50 bioavailable while the bioavailability studies for most of the drugs is not yet confirmed furthermore the bioavailable fraction is mostly excreted unchanged with a small portion converted to metabolites the impact of these metabolites on the environment and public health has not been fully studied 5 3 fate of antiretrovirals in the environment even though the success of pharmacokinetics of arvs is recent with the first arv drug zidovudine only introduced in 1987 warnke et al 2007 so much progress has been made in understanding their fate once discharged into the environment a study by al rajab et al 2010 has shown that tenofovir is persistent in soils with no evidence of transformation products or microbial based degradation al rajab et al 2010 according to aminot et al 2015 between 5 and 40 of ritonavir has been found to adsorb on suspended solids in a river system aminot et al 2015 hot seasonal conditions led to more ritonavir and other hydrophobic pharmaceuticals partitioning onto solid particulate matter a recent study by aminot et al 2018 has shown that the persistence of some pharmaceuticals including arvs is affected by aerobic physicochemical properties of water aminot et al 2018 the authors observed that abacavir ritonavir lamivudine and saquinavir had half lives of 5 days under biochemical conditions in surface water and wastewater nevirapine and zidovudine were considered very stable even under wwtp processes bagnis et al 2018 observed that effluent dilution factors due to discharge of untreated wastewater into surface water has an impact on the sorption behaviours of pharmaceuticals bagnis et al 2018 the only arv included in this study nevirapine showed its desorptive preference as the untreated effluent enters and becomes diluted by environmental water on the other hand giebułtowicz et al 2017 have observed that the concentration of darunavir only increases downstream before the effluent mixes with water but decreases after mixing giebułtowicz et al 2017 evidence provided by prasse et al 2010 indicated that conventional biological treatment followed by chemical phosphorus removal can substantially remove abacavir 99 lamivudine 76 and stavudine 78 from wastewater while some arvs such as nevirapine and zidovudine can by pass these processes prasse et al 2010 prasse et al 2015 have done laboratory scale studies to show that arvs under environmental conditions undergo both photo and bio transformation processes prasse et al 2015 abacavir zidovudine and emtricitabine were found to preferentially undergo photo transformation while zidovudine was mainly bio transformed these results are an indication that effluents can be held in open systems before release into the rivers this might be a welcome solution especially for developing countries with only the need for longer holding times where light is limited indirect phototransformation can be achieved through addition of quenchers eg n n dimethylaniline to scavenge co3 radicals or photosensitizers eg nano3 nahco3 as a proxie for co3 radicals jaatinen et al 2016 have indicated that zidovudine and nevirapine are 50 reduced during a hygienization process in which source separated urine was stored at 20 c for six months for application as a fertilizer jaatinen et al 2016 lamivudine was reduced by 76 with some transformation products detected but not identified a study by schoeman et al 2017 in south africa has shown that the conventional wastewater treatment processes eliminate up to 94 5 of efavirenz schoeman et al 2017 this was attributed to adsorption on biosolids with the efavirenz sludge concentration as high as 43 mg kg 1 table 3 in their study the persistence of nevirapine 22 5 removal under most wastewater treatment processes was also confirmed the chlorination process used for disinfection of water was also found to enhance the concentration of nevirapine due to deconjugation of its hydroxylated metabolite and lack of binding ability on solid material during the same process efavirenz concentration was increased by only 17 the same behaviour of nevirapine has been reported elsewhere k oreje et al 2016 prasse et al 2010 wood et al 2016 another study in kenya has reported the removal efficiencies of nevirapine 11 49 lamivudine 24 59 efavirenz 83 92 and zidovudine 99 in three wwtps k oreje et al 2016 these observations indicate that some arvs are persistent enough to by pass most wastewater treatment processes and remain in surface water they could eventually make their way to water sources and enter food chains humans can then be exposed through drinking water and food sources like crops vegetables fish and dairy products nevirapine and zidovudine are the most problematic arvs and easily by pass most wastewater treatment processes however none of the articles could link this behavior of nevirapine and zidovudine to their physicochemical properties such as the octanol water partitioning coefficient kow logarithmic acid dissociation constant pka and water solubility the evidence of their presence in surface water systems receiving wastewater effluents is discussed in section 6 1 5 4 human health effects of antiretrovirals while haart regimens have been effective in enhancing the immune system of hiv aids patients and eliminating the physical symptoms associated with the infection the regimens have themselves also manifested side effects with both cutaneous and psychological consequences in most cases the end result is a decline in adherence to therapy leading to regimen failure and drug resistance some reviews have been done on the toxicity of arvs abers et al 2014 carr and cooper 2000 esser et al 2007 hawkins 2010 kong and myers 2005 max and sherer 2000 the present review therefore summarizes the major points from the published reviews as well as those other arvs not mentioned in the previous reviews arvs with extreme side effect cases are given in table 2 generally it is observed that the side effects of most pis are related to the gastrointestinal tract boesecke and cooper 2008 hawkins 2010 the symptoms include diarrhoea nausea and vomiting ritonavir which is utilized as a booster in art has been found to have sensory neurotoxic effects including paraesthesias and altered taste sensations abers et al 2014 markowitz et al 1995 indinavir also exerts lipodystrophy while the major side effect due to amprenavir is rash kong and myers 2005 the nrtis and nnrtis mainly manifest their side effects in the peripheral and central nervous systems respectively in this regard peripheral neuropathy is common with nrtis due to inhibition of mitochondrial dna polymerase abers et al 2014 as such several conditions related to mitochondrial toxicity have been reported for example mitochondrial myopathy due to zidovudine and lactic acidosis due to stavudine and didanosine while the effect is mild with lamivudine emtricitabine abacavir and tenofovir abers et al 2014 brinkman et al 1998 hawkins 2010 venhoff et al 2007 walker et al 2004 in addition nrtis seem to also exert potential lipodystrophy with zidovudine and stavudine confirmed to affect fat redistribution in the body davidson et al 2010 menezes et al 2011 the major symptom is localized loss of fat tissues a condition known as lipoatrophy renal malfunctioning is also common with nrtis such as tenofovir and emtricitabine hamzah et al 2016 schmid et al 2007 solomon et al 2014 on the other hand prominent side effects among nnrtis include hepatotoxicity and rash with nevirapine and efavirenz being the main culprits brück et al 2008 chen et al 2007 hawkins 2010 jamisse et al 2007 kong and myers 2005 sulkowski et al 2002 it should be noted that mild rash has been observed for all pis and some nrtis such as zidovudine as shown in table 2 entry and fusion inhibitors mainly affect the respiratory system with symptoms like coughing pneumonia and fever reported for enfuvirtide and maraviroc they have also been confirmed to cause hypersensitivity syndrome other arvs from other classes with this effect include abacavir chirouze et al 2004 nevirapine hawkins 2010 and delavirdine mills et al 1998 studies on integrase inhibitors have shown that most of the arvs in this class enhance eryptosis the suicidal death of erythrocytes bhuyan et al 2016 bissinger et al 2016 2015 while psychiatric manifestations insomnia suicidality depression and anxiety have recently been reported for dolutegravir fettiplace et al 2017 scheper et al 2018 the most reported side effects in literature are that of the nnrti efavirenz this drug is notable for its central nervous system toxicity as well as potential for risk of psychosis abers et al 2014 funes et al 2014 gaida et al 2015 hawkins 2010 kenedi and goforth 2011 lochet et al 2003 rihs et al 2006 its central nervous system toxicity related symptoms include dizziness drowsiness and neuropsychotic experiences characterized by abnormal dreams hallucinations suicidality anxiety and impaired concentration arvs with risks associated with the cardiovascular system include the pis indinavir and lopinavir and the nrtis abacavir and didanosine the arv with the most hepatotoxicity is nevirapine and as such it is only recommended for patients with cd4 count less than 400 and 250 cells mm 3 for men and women respectively bailey and fisher 2008 cihlar and fordyce 2016 tenofovir has the most adverse effects on the functioning of the renal system davidson et al 2010 fernandez fernandez et al 2011 hawkins 2010 karras et al 2003 and is also reported to demineralize the bones hamzah et al 2016 it is worth mentioning that new arv drugs have been proven to be less toxicity than their predecessors for example atazanavir darunavir and raltegravir are new generation arvs with minimal side effects compared to their predecessors minami and yamamoto 2011 the efficacy of doravirine a new nnrti has been shown to be similar to efavirenz but its impact on the central nervous system is quite low cihlar and fordyce 2016 gatell et al 2014 also tenofovir alafenamide has shown less renal and bone toxicity compared to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate walensky et al 2016 it should be noted that these side effects due to various haart regimens are usually mild to moderate in severity therefore the therapeutic efficacy of arvs against hiv and the resultant improved life expectance far much exceed the reported side effects however knowledge of these potential side effects remains essential considering that the patients have to commit to them for life in cases where the side effects become severe the responsible arv is discontinued and replaced with another of the same class 5 5 ecotoxicological and human health risk assessment several ecotoxicological and human health risk assessment studies have been performed on arvs in environmental samples the ecotoxicological parameters that have been described include the predicted environmental concentration pec and the predicted no effect concentration pnec the pec is an estimation of the concentration of a compound in the environment based on its initial amount released into the environment with considerations of its fate transformation and removal either by artificial or natural means the initial amount released is related to its consumption and excretion data while environmental fate and transformation is based on its physicochemical properties mainly the kow and pka values on the other hand pnec is based on ecotoxicity data and can be defined as the concentration of a compound in the environment below which exposure to that compound will theoretically not cause harmful effects to any biota both the pec and pnec parameters are adopted from the swedish stockholm county council document of 2006 updated in 2010 and have been widely accepted as measures of environmental risk of pharmaceuticals deblonde and hartemann 2013 in some instances predicted critical environmental concentration cec is reported in place of pnec fick et al 2010 the ratio of pec to pnec also called the risk quotient rq is then used to predict the environmental risk of any pharmaceutical the pec pnec ratio or rq value of 0 1 is considered of insignificant risk 0 1 1 of low risk 1 10 of moderate risk and 10 is high risk a retrospective analysis can then be done based on the predictions this approach has been described as a suspect screening approach ferrando climent et al 2016 pochodylo and helbling 2017 the major drawback for these pec pnec ratios is that they are point specific and depend on the specific dosage amounts hence they cannot be used to predict the global toxicity of a particular arv in addition these predictions are dependent on the accuracy of the prescription and consumption datasets while consumption data from a hospital can be reliable it is the prescription data that is biased because it assumes that all the prescribed drugs were consumed another concern is the rigidity of the approach eliminating some pollutants based on predictive models disregards the possibility of formation of degradation products that in some cases have higher toxicity than their parent compounds the ratios also use average yearly consumption values and disregard variations that occur such as population fluctuations due to visits and temporary migrations as is the norm in resort towns and big cities including african towns and cities on an individual scale pec pnec values specific for a particular arv sink can be useful for any organization in deciding which arvs to monitor in their effluents predictive screening of potential ecotoxicity of arvs and any other pharmaceutical is advantageous because it is focused less strenuous and cost effective pharmaceuticals predicted to be of low risk can then be excluded from monitoring programs up until that time when the predicted rq values suggest a potential environmental risk there is evidence in literature showing that most of the arvs were not detected by researchers doing a random analysis abafe et al 2018 peng et al 2014 the predictive models have been used as a basis for investigating presence of arvs and other pharmaceuticals mainly in hospital and wwtp effluents cunningham et al 2009 daouk et al 2015 escher et al 2011 ferrando climent et al 2016 fick et al 2010 helwig et al 2016 k oreje et al 2012 minguez et al 2016 the persistence bioaccumulation and toxicity index pbt index which is a cumulative sum of persistence bioaccumulation and toxicity values each with a 0 3 range has also been used in estimating the ecotoxicological risk assessment of arvs deblonde and hartemann 2013 jean et al 2012 another parameter the margin of exposure moe also based on hospital consumption datasets has been defined by le corre et al 2012 in which a value of 1 indicates no health concern to the human population le corre et al 2012 generally the applicability of these predictive models and others that have been applied as first tier prioritization schemes has been confirmed and discussed in detail by roos et al 2012 roos et al 2012 5 6 risk assessment protocol a critical step in any environmental pollutant analysis is identifying if there are any potential sources of that pollutant that can lead to unintentional introduction into the environment for pollutants of pharmaceutical origin the general approach would be through the prescription dataset route pharmaceuticals such as arvs are intentionally synthesized for their therapeutic properties and given to individuals through a prescription the next step is to understand the environmental fate and eventual ecotoxicological effects the parent compound and its degradation products can then be quantified in different environmental compartments followed by remediation if necessary recently retrospective analysis is preferred in which predictive models discussed in section 5 5 are used to prioritize pharmaceuticals rather than following the expensive and time consuming full scan non targeted analysis fig 4 suggests a general protocol to follow when identifying a pharmaceutical with a potential for ecotoxicity the protocol involves the need to identify all arvs prescribed by a country followed by considerations for arv prescription data for specific communities as well as consumption datasets for hospitals and clinics datasets from these point sources can then be used in predictive screening of the target analytes those arvs with an rq 0 1 can then be prioritized in effluents from wwtps and medical institutions for developed countries where there are strict guidelines for disposal and treatment of effluents monitoring studies can be done while those countries especially africa and the middle east that release untreated or inadequately treated effluents quantitation studies need to be conducted and remediation approaches introduced arvs like any other pharmaceuticals are pseudo persistent and therefore will need to be continuously monitored collection of datasets also needs to be a periodical process since new arvs with better clinical efficacy against hiv are being discovered and introduced into treatment programs it is essential to do risk assessment studies based on community and hospital data separately the advantage is that if there is any need to address the risk the target point source is specific and the measures taken become focused on a smaller amount of wastewater which is cost effective helwig et al 2016 6 determination of antiretrovirals in environmental samples 6 1 current trends the main pathway of arvs into surface water bodies after excretion from the human body is through release of untreated or improperly treated effluents from wwtps hospitals and production facilities from an african context improper sanitation and illegal disposal of both domestic and industrial waste is another potential source of arvs in the environment the list of arvs that have been detected in environmental samples is given in table 3 firstly the results show that the detection of arvs in wwtp effluents and various environmental compartments is recent secondly levels of arvs in environmental water samples in africa are higher than anywhere else this might be related to prevalence of the hiv aids epidemic and the large treatment programs release of untreated or less treated wastewater as well as limited dilution of the effluents due to drought effects low rainfall and high evapotranspiration may be a factor the situation is aggravated by the limited performance of available wastewater treatment processes against pharmaceuticals resulting in release of contaminated effluents to surface water funke et al 2016 the concentration of arvs in surface water bodies of developing countries is expected to increase considering that the countries with high art programs do not have treatment guidelines regarding the presence of pharmaceuticals in wwtp effluents in addition the lack of proper sanitation systems in certain parts of africa could lead to the increase of arvs in surface water due to the direct disposal of fecal matter and urine into the ground which could be carried into the rivers during the rainfall thirdly more research is in the industrialized northern hemisphere where the epidemic is minimal compared to the developing countries madikizela et al 2017 and gwenzi and chaukura 2018 have both observed that analysis of pharmaceuticals in african water samples is generally less compared to other continents with the authors noting lack of advanced analytical instrumentation gwenzi and chaukura 2018 madikizela et al 2017 it is observed that some european researchers have taken african samples for analysis in europe bischel et al 2015 while some have gone as far as doing laboratory scale studies to explain the fate of active pharmaceuticals in untreated effluents of africa and the middle east bagnis et al 2018 these european based results may not necessarily explain the fate of arvs in an african context because of the geochemical and climatic differences between the two hemispheres fourthly zidovudine lamivudine and nevirapine appear prominently in surface water rivers and dams with concentrations as high as 17 410 167 000 and 5620 ng l 1 respectively recorded in kenya k oreje et al 2016 in wwtp effluents these three arvs have been recorded as high as 973 31 070 and 1357 ng l 1 respectively k oreje et al 2016 ngumba et al 2016b wood et al 2015 zidovudine is the most analyzed and detected arv in environmental samples lamivudine has the highest reported concentration in surface water 167 000 ng l 1 recorded in kenya k oreje et al 2016 while efavirenz is highest in wwtp effluents with a value of 34 000 ng l 1 recorded in south africa abafe et al 2018 arvs that have been found in drinking water are zidovudine 72 7 ng l 1 in south africa wood et al 2015 darunavir 3 4 ng l 1 in poland giebułtowicz et al 2017 and lamivudine 27 73 ng l 1 in the usa furlong et al 2017 carboxylated transformation products of abacavir emtricitabine and lamivudine 80 41 84 ng l 1 respectively have also been detected in german drinking water funke et al 2016 6 2 ecotoxicological effects in non human species not much has been done in understanding the ecotoxicity of arvs in non target species such as aquatic organisms and plants especially those species that are a source of food to humans abacavir has been found to be harmful to green algae with an ec50 value of 57 mg l 1 while it was less toxic to the other study organisms crustcean and diatom with ec50 values all reported as greater than 100 mg l 1 minguez et al 2016 this is worrying considering that green algae are the main primary producers in aquatic ecosystems ngumba et al 2016a b have calculated rq values for aquatic life and found that zidovudine and nevirapine had potential ecotoxicological effects on algae daphnia and fish with algae being the most affected ngumba et al 2016a lamivudine did not display any ecotoxicity towards these aquatic species robson et al 2017 have shown that a concentration of efavirenz as low as 10 3 ng l 1 has serious health effects on oreochromis mossambicus fish robson et al 2017 a review by guo et al 2015 observed that the ecotoxicological exposure risk of arvs towards algae due to human use is insignificant guo et al 2015 their ecotoxicity data only addressed a european situation where the hiv aids pandemic and the concentration of arvs in wwtp effluents is very small compared to the african story 6 3 sampling for antiretroviral analysis it is observed that most sampling methods used do not address the possibility of short term arv variations the common approach reported in most articles is grab sampling within a treatment plant or at different positions of a river system and dams it is of the authors view that considerations for sampling times and frequency of sampling are important in arv analysis arvs are taken at specific prescribed times of the day for the rest of the person s life implying that there are certain times that the arv levels in water systems are very high in addition ort et al 2010 have identified sampling errors related to long sampling intervals and inadequate sampling modes as contributors to overinterpretation of pharmaceutical ecotoxicological data ort et al 2010 solutions to these errors and biases can be the design of predictive models and also consideration for passive sampling approaches automated samplers and online sensors wooding et al 2017 have also developed a low cost disposable sorptive sampling loop made of polydimethylsiloxane for selective extraction of pharmaceuticals including arvs from water samples wooding et al 2017 6 4 extraction and isolation techniques understanding the fate of pharmaceutical drugs requires appropriately validated analytical techniques that can efficiently extract the low concentration analytes that also exist as mixtures with other organics with related physicochemical properties from high matrix samples since environmental samples are complex in addition to pharmaceutical pollutants existing in trace levels there is always need for isolation and preconcentration before chromatographic quantitation the current approaches for analysis of arvs in aqueous samples are mainly through solid phase extraction spe table 3 for solid samples microwave assisted extraction followed by spe aminot et al 2015 and sonication and quechers schoeman et al 2017 have been reported the performance of these techniques is summarized in table 3 most of the spe methods listed in table 3 use the waters oasis hydrophilic lipophilic balance oasis hlb cartridges this spe sorbent is listed in the us epa method 1694 for analysis of pharmaceuticals in environmental samples other reported spe adsorbents are isolute env prasse et al 2010 cleanert pep schoeman et al 2017 lichrolut en rp18 margot et al 2013 bond elut plexa rimayi et al 2018 and the waters oasis mcx aminot et al 2016 2015 some studies have combined oasis hlb with isolute env sorbents bischel et al 2015 kovalova et al 2012 while ibáñez et al 2017 have used an spe cartridge containing stratax strata wax strata wcx and isoluteenv ibáñez et al 2017 generally the oasis hlb cartridges have been proven to perform better than other sorbents when doing a simultaneous analysis of pharmaceuticals ngumba et al 2016b this could be due to its ability to extract a group of chemicals from environmental samples that differ in chemical properties in addition loss of arvs has been observed for some cartridges including 53 63 and 44 reported for abacavir nevirapine and zidovudine respectively using a waters oasis mcx spe sorbent aminot et al 2015 this implies that the oasis hlb remains the spe sorbent of choice in the analysis of arvs molecularly imprinted polymers mips have come of age and have also been reported in the analysis of abacavir in environmental samples terzopoulou et al 2016 the mip in this study had a binding affinity of 149 mg g 1 another mip reported for abacavir but not applied in real samples had a binding capacity of 157 mg g 1 chianella et al 2006 limited applications for the mip adsorbents for the extraction of arvs could be due to their non commercial availability in addition arvs are simultaneously detected in the environment whereas mips are easily synthesized for single analytes as such mips for arvs have only been applied in the analysis of abacavir 6 5 analytical instrumentation and detection techniques fast instrumentation with sensitive detectors is needed to monitor pharmaceuticals including arvs and their transformation products in complex environmental samples liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry lc ms is the most used in analysis of pharmaceuticals as such it was observed that the literature reporting arvs in this review mainly used uhplc esi qtof ms table 3 while the lc linear ion trap ltq orbitrap ms prasse et al 2015 has also been reported generally lc esi hrms has the ability of detecting these pharmaceuticals in the ng l 1 scale as shown in table 3 both the qtof and orbitrap are characterized by high mass accuracy and resolution with the ability to identify isotopic abundance ibáñez et al 2017 for a retrospective analysis the spectral noise is removed leaving only the data related to the target analytes another advantage of lc esi hrms is the ability to detect and confirm the presence of compounds whose reference standards are not available in the market new arvs with better therapeutic efficiency are constantly being introduced to replace those that are already in use hrms then becomes important in the environmental analysis of the discontinued arvs and those that did not pass the clinical trial stage an spe hplc dad method for determination of lamivudine nevirapine and zidovudine in urine samples has also been reported pynnönen and tuhkanen 2014 this method had unfavorable method detection limit values of 71 1610 μg l 1 which could limit its applicability in natural water where arvs are present in the ng l 1 scale 7 remediation of antiretrovirals in the environment remediation studies on some arvs through exposing them to controlled biochemical processes have been reported in literature an et al 2011 have described a photocatalytic decontamination mechanism of lamivudine using tio2 as a catalyst an et al 2011 in their study they identified six non toxic hydroxylated derivatives which were further mineralized completely within 6 h into co2 h2o so4 2 no3 and nh3 nh4 in a study reported by prasse et al 2015 abacavir was shown to form a stable carboxy abacavir by product under normal environmental conditions while lamivudine emtricitabine and zidovudine were finally mineralized and taken up by microbes prasse et al 2015 funke et al 2016 have investigated the degradation kinetics for arvs during biological treatment of wastewater in germany funke et al 2016 their results showed that the arvs undergo rapid biotransformation through oxidation of the terminal hydroxyl group and the thioether group if present to carboxy transformation products in their study abacavir emtricitabine ganciclovir lamivudine and zidovudine were detected in influents while their carboxy transformation products were the major components in effluents after biotransformation conversion rates reported ranged from 53 for zidovudine to 99 for abacavir these transformation products are stable under environmental conditions and were therefore also detected in surface water bodies receiving the treated effluents as well as in drinking water the ecotoxicity of these transformation products has not yet been reported only zidovudine could be detected in these samples confirming its stability against treatment processes ozonation and activated carbon were effective in eliminating the transformation products from drinking water the ozonation products were not identified while some of these transformation products are more toxic than their parent compounds funke et al 2016 they are expected to have reduced activity against the virus this is an area that needs serious consideration because it can either be a welcome relief or a nightmare in as far as production of resistant strains is concerned abafe et al 2018 have recently reported that the conventional anaerobic digestion of wastewater followed by chlorination led to over 99 removal of abacavir lamivudine and zidovudine from effluents while atazanavir efavirenz lopinavir and nevirapine remained persistent abafe et al 2018 however the transformation products were not identified wood et al 2016 have shown the persistence of nevirapine under chlorination of water wood et al 2016 chlorination is the most common method for disinfecting water for drinking processes in developing countries also chlorination is the final step of wastewater treatment process in most countries in their study several transformation products were characterized the characterization results showed that some of these by products had antiviral properties and also existed in surface water samples receiving wastewater effluents other interesting results from this study was the observation that nevirapine was more degraded through chlorination at high ph conditions than in acidic conditions under simulated wastewater matrix only 5 of nevirapine was degraded kovalova et al 2012 have shown in a pilot study that a membrane bioreactor eliminates up to 78 of ritonavir kovalova et al 2012 mccurry et al 2014 have demonstrated the performance of an anaerobic fluidized membrane bioreactor against activated carbon under aerobic carbon for abacavir emtricitabine and lamivudine mccurry et al 2014 the removal values through the bioreactor were 100 63 and 99 respectively some of these metabolites such as the carboxy abacavir have been confirmed to form during metabolism of arvs in the body cihlar and ray 2010 zhou et al 2015 have shown that photolysis of arvs lamivudine and zidovudine as test compounds is enhanced by presence of nitrates under normal environmental conditions zhou et al 2015 in their study high levels of dissolved organic matter also enhanced the photodegradation of lamivudine while the effect was inhibitory for zidovudine the transformation products were not determined degradation products of lamivudine bedse et al 2009 and tenofovir kurmi et al 2015 due to hydrolysis under both acidic and alkaline condition were also characterized margot et al 2013 have shown that the removal rate of ritonavir under nitrification activated sludge and ozonation was 25 56 and 78 respectively margot et al 2013 wang et al 2010 have shown that iron carbon micro electrolysis can remove up to 90 of lamivudine in wastewater wang et al 2010 the same approach has been shown in another study in which 85 of zidovudine was removed from pharmaceutical wastewater li et al 2011 advanced wastewater treatment technologies that are known to remove some pharmaceutical residues such as ozonation activated carbon and biodegradation are expensive for key populations in developing countries 8 challenges available data provides evidence that current wastewater treatment processes are not able to eliminate arvs from water implying that large amounts of arvs are released into the environment in addition unesco has stated that over 80 of the global wastewater is discharged into the environment without any form of treatment unesco 2017 arvs like any other pharmaceutical drug might be introduced into the environment in the nanogram per litre concentration but data is lacking on the prolonged human exposure since arvs are considered as pseudo persistent pollutants very few studies have provided ecotoxicity data in non target species like fish and vegetables all of which form part of a human diet bioaccumulation and trophic magnification of arvs have not yet been investigated too the scarcity of water and lack of proper sanitation especially in drought stricken areas results in elevated concentration of pharmaceuticals in water bodies this is a dire situation especially for communities that use unprocessed water from these water bodies for drinking and irrigation purposes most retrospective studies have been done on public hospitals datasets from private hospitals are not readily accessible while data collection from developing countries is a very difficult task new arvs and arv combinations are also being discovered while more are still in their clinical development for example dolutegravir has been developed as a robust cost effective substitute for efavirenz while tenofovir alafenamide is replacing tenofovir disoproxil fumarate barnhart and shelton 2015 clercq 2016 mills et al 2016 vitoria et al 2017 the evidence of efficacy of lower arv concentrations such as that of efavirenz 400 mg versus the conventional 600 mg prescription vitoria et al 2017 is an indication that there is reason to be worried of presence of arvs in food sources including drinking water in addition using hospital consumption data results in underestimation of pecs because arvs are taken for life and more likely to be found in domestic waste than hospital effluents with who promoting treat all and prophylaxis programs there is a possibility of production of arv drugs becoming a global thing to improve accessibility and affordability while in developed countries effluents from factories undergo strict guidelines this becomes a concern in low and medium income countries where there is a possibility of unmonitored release of contaminated effluents into surface water bodies most wwtps have not yet been upgraded or evaluated for the capacity to eliminate pharmaceuticals including arvs this implies that there is still a global denial among municipalities that there is direct deposition of pharmaceuticals into surface water through disposal of improperly treated wastewater effluents for impoverished communities with poor sanitation surface runoff is of concern as a vector of arv contamination because it directly deposits arvs in their original form unlike wwtp effluents in which the medication undergoes some form of degradation another serious concern is that while art programs successfully revive one s health they do not eliminate the virus with the infected looking more health than the uninfected kaler et al 2016 this inability to differentiate is a social danger because more are bound to have unprotected sex based on one s physical appearance leading to more infections the current risk assessment parameters that have been reported for fate of arvs in the environment are not exhaustive and lack the description of possibility of development of resistant hiv strains due to presence of trace levels of arvs in drinking water and food sources risk assessment studies experimental or predictive for arvs cannot be simplified under other pharmaceuticals because their exposure has extreme consequences in the body as it relates to the drug s future therapeutic efficacy against the virus declarations based on predictive pec pnec and rqs may not hold for arvs considering that their presence in the body relate to the virus tendency to develop resistance arvs are highly specific drugs and are expected to exert their impact even at very low environmental concentrations general questions for consideration may include does presence of any trace level of an arv taken orally and unintentionally with food or drinking water alone or in combination with others have an effect on the viral behavior in the body it is predicted that the available data on the adverse health effects of arvs summarized in section 5 4 is not as important as their enhanced ability to trigger production of resistant strains that can no longer be controlled using the same drug considering that this only occurs if the drug is not taken according to prescription human exposure to arvs becomes a serious concern for public health there is a possibility that arv contamination might exceed the maximum permissible intake as a measure of amount exposed per unit body mass before a true cure for hiv is found this might also hinder scientists in finding a true cure for hiv because as the drug goes through clinical trials it gets released to the environment exposing the population the end result is a reduced pool of arvs for people living with hiv aids and also a possibility of the working regimens to be effective for reduced times the possibility of drug drug interactions once a patient on arv medication is exposed to a pollutant drug needs serious consideration continuous exposure might result in dosage additive or synergistic effects evidence is available for intra class drug enhancement while some studies have confirmed that transformation products follow the same pharmacokinetic pathways implying that exposure results in reduced efficacy of the prescribed regimen cihlar and ray 2010 in addition cyp3a inhibitors such as cobicistat are not recommended for regimens consumed at least twice a day because they may result in unexpected deviations in efficacy of the other arvs exposure to such arvs through contaminated food sources is of concern the studies on sewer treatment transformations is necessary as it can afford researchers to select stable byproducts and use them as biomarkers that can be identified using mass spectrometry reid et al 2014 however the idea of biomarkers has its own challenges such as concentrations below the method detection limit and the potential existence of other compounds that give the same target biomarker resulting in overestimation of the extent of release of the parent compound into the environment another instrumental challenge is the observation that the limit of detection values for some pharmaceuticals are well above their pnec values implying that it becomes difficult to evaluate their ecotoxicities which we believe is the case with the ecotoxicity of arvs there is therefore a need for considering the detection limit of the extraction method used before declaring a pharmaceutical not present in the environment orias and perrodin 2013 9 future perspectives considering that quite a number of arvs are available which differ according to region there is need for more point specific prediction data on risk potential to allow each community to prioritize targeted arvs this has been observed in developed countries and the concern lies with african countries where studies have mainly focused on randomized analysis versus targeted monitoring based on predictive screening methodologies most european countries have initiated country based environmental risk ranking studies of pharmaceuticals based on consumption datasets available from hospital consumptions and community prescriptions however the datasets on daily arv consumption is still limited especially for african countries with large arv programs implying that environmental risk assessment predictions cannot be reliably modelled in this regard it is observed that most pec and pnec predictions are done for european countries making monitoring and consumption data available will help in better understanding the ecotoxicological risks associated with presence of arvs in the environment and to determine what measures to take to address that risk at point source level expensive but effective treatment technologies can then be considered on point sources where the arvs have very high pec values there is need for considerations for removal of arvs and other pharmaceuticals through optimizing the existing technologies in wwtps or introducing new technologies alternatively the approach can be source control where biodegradability becomes essential or considerations for urine source separation technologies such as the nomix toilets escher et al 2011 especially in less developed areas imparted by the hiv aids pandemic such as southern african countries there is also a need for serious considerations for exposure effects in treatment experienced patients eg perinatal infected adolescents patients already resistant to the drug patients in which the drug is not yet in their prescription list as well as patients based on age extent of viral load and the general public at large arv regimens are also age specific and biased towards certain individuals such as pregnant women implying that the risk assessment studies need to be specific prediction values are based on consumption and prescription data and excretion rates but disregard biodegradability and bioaccumulation of target compounds orias and perrodin 2013 there is need for considerations of metabolites and transformation products in order to have a realistic understanding of the fate of arvs in the environment and their potential ecotoxicity with most of the transformation products of arvs unknown the environmental impact of arvs remains a research challenge for environmental analysts more research on impact of wwtp effluents is needed especially from the countries with high art programs it is observed that south africa and kenya have made significant progress in the analysis of arvs in their surface water bodies most health risk assessment studies are confined in the western world while the developing countries have focused on quantitation to provide evidence of presence in water bodies the analysis of pharmaceuticals from an african context is fast growing with several review articles including this one being used as a tool for aggravating researchers from this part of the world to stand up and serve the continent from a potential catastrophe it is also observed that most studies on the presence of arvs in african waters are conducted in urban areas however there is a high population of hiv infected people residing in rural areas where there are no proper sanitation systems people in most rural areas depend on untreated river water as the only source of drinking water which is also shared with their animals such as pigs etc that are used as food sources due to droughts and scarcity of rainfalls especially in winter the water level in the rivers become too low which could result in pre concentration of pollutants that include arvs therefore the monitoring programs should be extended to rural communities where people go to the nearest bush for excretion of the body waste which is usually washed off to small rivers if not eaten by animals food sources with the biotransformation and sorptive nature of most arvs unknown in silico studies can be a useful tool in predicting the in sewer fate of these pharmaceuticals software that predicts metabolic pathways of arvs including any other pharmaceuticals whose data is still not readily available is now available such as the meteor lhasa ltd leeds uk and smartcyp university of copenhagen reid et al 2014 several programs listed in the usepa s estimation programs interface epi suite can also be used to predict the kinetics of a compound during sewer treatment and under normal environmental conditions in the absence of experimental data usepa 2012 these include the ecological structure activity relationships ecosar sanderson et al 2004 thomaidi et al 2015 the sistema de tratamento de ponto stpwin and the biological biowin model reid et al 2014 the ecosar model utilizes the kow values to estimate aquatic toxicity while the stpwin and biowin models predict half lives as a function of the sorptive nature and biodegradability of the compound respectively transformation products can also be predicted in silico using models such as the university of minnesota pathway prediction system um pps and the catabolism software catabol bletsou et al 2015 the ecotoxicological risk associated with combinational disposal of arvs needs to be modelled cumulative synergy or additivity when the arvs co exist in the environment also in the presence of matrix effects is another area that needs serious consideration during ecotoxicological studies while each drug may exist within the predicted no effect concentration mixture effect due to same type of arvs with the same mode of action against the virus may lead to synergic or additive impact against the virus previous studies have confirmed concentration addition for pharmaceuticals from the same therapeutic class escher et al 2011 kamba et al 2017 evidence is available in literature that show that some arvs experience drug drug interactions amongst themselves and also with other classes of pharmaceuticals golla et al 2016 kurmi et al 2016a 2016b kurmi and singh 2017 warnke et al 2007 welzen et al 2011 for example solid state stress studies done on several arv pairs have shown that their co existence in the environment results in interaction products in addition to their pre known transformation products golla et al 2016 kurmi et al 2016a 2016b kurmi and singh 2017 it has also been found that efavirenz and nevirapine may require dosage modification in patients also taking anticonvulsants warnke et al 2007 the same authors also list those drugs that should not be co administered with certain protease inhibitors finally the authors also emphasize the need to consider analysis of arvs in aquatic species soils and sediments as this is another area with limited ecotoxicological data related to the presence of arvs in the environment such species and sediments can be those directly linked to aquatic environments that receive effluents from wwtp agricultural soils ameliorated with biosolids as well as vegetables and crops grown under organic fertilized land can be another area of interest plant toxicity as well as phytoremediation of arvs is another topic that could be exciting to researchers 10 conclusions so much progress has been achieved in understanding hiv aids pandemic and the therapeutic efficacy of arvs to the extent that the disease can be viewed as a normal disease that anyone can have and freely disclose his positive status the environmental concerns associated with unmonitored release of arvs into surface water has led to researchers doing studies in order to have a better understanding of their fate and ecotoxicological effects once released into the environment currently the datasets are limited but evidence shows that the research on the presence of arvs in environmental samples is on a rise arvs are a special group of pharmaceuticals and a deviation from their prescription dosages results in the development of resistant strains of the virus thus more analysis and monitoring datasets are needed urgently to prevent exposing the human population through contaminated water and food sources especially for developing countries where the hiv aids epidemic is at its highest funding this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not for profit sectors 
19287,landfill leachate contains extremely diverse mixtures of pollutants and thus requires appropriate treatment before discharge co treatment of landfill leachate with sewage in wastewater treatment plants is a common approach because of low cost and convenience however some recalcitrant organic compounds in leachate can escape biological treatment processes lower the uv transmittance of waste streams due to their uv quenching properties and interfere with the associated disinfection efficacy thus the leachate uv quenching substances uvqs must be removed or reduced to a level that uv disinfection is not strongly affected uvqs consist of three major fractions humic acids fulvic acids and hydrophilics each of which has distinct characteristics and behaviors during treatment the purpose of this review is to provide a synthesis of the state of the science regarding uvqs and possible treatment approaches in general chemical electrochemical and physical treatments are more effective than biological treatments but also costlier integration of multiple treatment methods to target the removal of different fractions of uvqs can aid in optimizing treatment the importance of uvqs effects on wastewater treatment should be better recognized and understood with implemented regulations and improved research and treatment practice graphical abstract image 1 keywords landfill

process of stabilization the landfilled solid waste produces liquid waste called leachate via the infiltration of water from precipitation into the landfill and the moisture in the waste damiano et al

2016 this leachate is a complex wastewater containing a vast array of pollutants which can result in major environmental impact and adverse human health risk if not contained and treated appropriately kjeldsen et al 2002 renou et al 2008 because of the complexity and wide variation of leachate dissolved organic carbon doc there is no single treatment process that works for all leachates comstock et

biodegradable organics from leachates with recalcitrant organic fractions left behind other methods such as physicochemical gupta et al 2014a jung et al 2017 electrochemical shao et al 2006 xiao et al

kang et al 2002 mohammadzadeh et al 2005 these organics can be converted from low molecular weight aliphatic compounds into high molecular weight aromatic compounds due to condensation and polymerization of byproducts from microbial degradation bolyard and reinhart 2017 the high molecular weight aromatic compounds are generally hydrophobic consisting mainly of humic substances e g humic and fulvic acids the low molecular weight aliphatic compounds are mostly hydrophilic both low and high molecular weight substances in municipal solid waste landfill leachates can strongly absorb uv light those substances are usually refractory in most treatment processes of wwtps and can eventually interfere with the downstream uv disinfection process zhao et al 2013a due to their uv quenching abilities these substances are collectively called ultraviolet quenching substances uvqs uv quenching by leachate organics which is synonymous with to put out the uv light can have an adverse effect on disinfection even if landfill leachate constitutes as low as 0 1 of the total flow into a municipal wwtp bolyard 2016 bolyard et al 2018a reinhart and bolyard 2015 in addition uv disinfection can become ineffective in removing antibiotic resistance genes args as args can be absorbed on humic acids surfaces during uv treatment yu et al 2016 leachate organics can also stimulate the production of carcinogenic disinfection byproducts dbps i e haloacetic acid haloalkanes if organics are present at a concentration over 2 mg l 1 during chlorination disinfection nikolaou et al 2004 therefore it is evident that the addition of complex landfill leachate into municipal wastewater treatment systems poses a serious challenge to wastewater treatment performance it is imperative to develop effective treatment approaches to reduce uvqs to an acceptable level before routing it to wastewater treatment facilities this requires a better understanding of properties and chemical characteristics of uvqs along with their behaviors in different treatment practices the purpose of this review is to provide a detailed introduction of landfill leachate induced uvqs with respect to source formation and characteristics a comprehensive evaluation of the current status of leachate treatment for uvqs removal and in depth discussion of the perspectives of uvqs control for wastewater treatment 2 characteristics of uvqs 2 1 formation the uvqs of leachate contain hydrophilic fraction hpi and hydrophobic humic substances humic acids ha and fulvic acids fa hydrophilic aliphatic carbons are formed through the decomposition of organic solid wastes within a landfill while humic substances are formed through complex biological and chemical reactions by a humification process castagnoli et al 1990 jones and bryan 1998 several reaction pathways on humification involving lignin polyphenols and sugar amines condensation have been proposed jones and bryan 1998 lignin is abundantly present in paper and paperboard wood leaves and other vegetation and acts as a precursor for humic substances in landfills according to a usepa report paper and paperboard 14 3 yard trimmings 7 9 and wood 8 1 accounted for approximately 30 3 of the total landfilled msw in 2014 thereby serving as sources of lignin usepa 2016 the process of humification may also be aided by proteins carbohydrates and fatty acids present in food wastes which made up 21 6 of the disposed msw into landfills in 2014 usepa 2016 because of the wide variety of precursors e g lignin proteins carbohydrates and fatty acids source materials e g paper and paperboard wood vegetation and food waste and environmental conditions humic substances in landfill leachate differ significantly in terms of chemical structures and properties castagnoli et al 1990 ratasuk and nanny 2007 tahiri et al 2016 humic substances are structurally heterogeneous macromolecules yellow to black in color and acidic in nature specifically they are covalently bonded agglomerates of aliphatic i e hydrophilic fraction and aromatic moieties that contain phenolic carboxyl alkoxy and amido groups along with occasional presence of sulphate esters phosphate esters semiquinone and hydroquinone groups castagnoli et al 1990 jones and bryan 1998 the hydrophobicity of humic substances might also be enhanced by the presence of carboxyl rich alicyclic molecules and material derived from linear terpenoids i e terpenoids contain five carbon isoprene units lam et al 2007 humic substances grow in size by incorporating smaller fractions using c o c c van der waals π π ch π and hydrogen bonds dec and bollag 2000 freeman et al 2001 jones and bryan 1998 piccolo 2002 piccolo et al 2000 heterogeneity of humic substances in leachates and difficulty in characterizing them are largely attributed to their progressive change with age nanny and ratasuk 2002 it is believed that in a young leachate fa are formed first and thus their concentration could be higher than that of ha artiola fortuny and fuller 1982 kang et al 2002 nanny and ratasuk 2002 however with humification ha concentration increases with time and eventually decreases as landfills become stable and natural degradation and or dilution takes place artiola fortuny and fuller 1982 nanny and ratasuk 2002 considering the long exposure of the precursors to water oxygen and radiation i e sunlight humic substances are often considered the final products of the bio degradative and oxidative pathways jones and bryan 1998 due to this humic substances are considered as old molecules that are resistant to further biological treatment and susceptible to specific treatments i e advanced oxidation that they have not experienced before jones and bryan 1998 additionally the multiple redox states and reversibility of redox sites in humic substances increase its recalcitrance to microbial oxidation ratasuk and nanny 2007 biodegradable organic matter including volatile fatty acids is formed through the initial decomposition of organic solid waste such as food scraps they are usually aliphatic structures and fractionated as a part of hpi bolyard and reinhart 2017 due to this simple carbon chained structure they are susceptible to microbial degradation and contribute significantly to the readily biodegradable chemical oxygen demand cod and biochemical oxygen demand bod especially in raw fresh leachates however they only contribute a small portion 10 on average of the overall uv absorbance of leachates zhao et al 2013a in addition this biodegradable organic matter can be easily removed in the biological treatment processes in wwtps before entering the downstream uv disinfection system and thus is usually not a significant issue for uv disinfection in wwtps 2 2 composition leachate uvqs measured as toc mainly consist of ha fa and hpi fractions the ratio of which is highly variable and depends on many factors such as waste type operating conditions and landfill age the percentages of ha fa and hpi fractions vary at 2 1 44 7 72 and 24 9 70 1 of doc respectively table 1 gupta et al 2014b nanny and ratasuk 2002 zhang et al 2009 2013 the molecular weight of humic substances ranges from low less than 500 to 2000 g mol 1 for fa to high 50 000 to 100 000 g mol 1 for ha while the typical molecular weight of the hpi fraction is similar to that of fa amaral et al 2015b kang et al 2002 zhang et al 2009 because of the wide distribution and the aggregation properties of humic substances it is difficult to find the real size of a humic structure jones and bryan 1998 according to a previous study hydrophobic humic substances are more polydisperse polydispersity index 1 while hydrophilic fractions are more monodisperse polydispersity index 1 with the presence of homogeneous compounds in hydrophilic fractions and heterogeneous compounds in hydrophobic fractions table 1 seo et al 2007 leachate ha have a higher content of c h and n and a lower content of o than those of fa and hpi fractions kang et al 2002 in turn the o c ratio in fa is higher than that in ha implying that fa have a higher proportion of o alkyl and carboxylic acid functional groups table 1 huo et al 2009 the carboxylic acidities of ha are lower than those of fa and hpi while the phenolic acidities of ha are higher than those of fa christensen et al 1998 due to the presence of a relatively small amount of ionizable carboxylic acid groups along with a substantial amount of aliphatic and aromatic moieties ha can easily agglomerate and precipitate upon charge neutralization at ph 2 while fa are soluble at all ph range jones and bryan 1998 sometimes ha show a high value of o c ratio because of the presence of a higher carbohydrate content christensen et al 1998 for this reason the ratio of o c can often be misleading if used to compare the carboxylic acid content in organic fractions the n content of the organics typically follows a pattern of ha hpi fa and ha and hpi can have doubled n content compared to fa huo et al 2009 the low value of h c 1 suggests predominantly aromatic structures and the order of the h c ratio is ha fa hpi indicating that hydrophilics are more aliphatic than hydrophobics table 1 christensen et al 1998 huo et al 2008 2 3 separation and quantification of uvqs the hydrophilic and hydrophobic fractions of leachate uvqs can be fractionated using different nonionic or ionic cationic and anionic resin adsorption methods these fractionation procedures are time consuming and prone to cross contamination if not carefully handled imai et al 2001 most of the studies on fractionation of uvqs in landfill leachate focused on ha fa and hpi fractions ma et al 2001 a detailed speciation process is illustrated in fig 1 in this process a leachate sample is firstly filtered to remove suspended particles membranes with pore sizes from 0 45 μm to 1 5 μm have been employed for this purpose gupta et al 2014b seo et al 2007 thurman and malcolm 1981 after that a concentrated inorganic acid i e sulfuric or hydrochloric acid is added to precipitate the ha fraction at ph 2 dia et al 2017 the solution containing the precipitates is then centrifuged or filtered to separate the precipitated ha the separated ha can be re dissolved in a 0 1m naoh solution for further analysis the supernatant after separating the precipitated ha contains the fa and hpi fractions and is then passed through a xad 8 resin column where the fa fraction is adsorbed on the resin more details about xad 8 resin cleaning methods can be found in several previous studies leenheer 1981 ma et al 2001 thurman and malcolm 1981 the portion of the supernatant that passes through the resin column contains the hpi fraction the adsorbed fa fraction can be back eluted by a 0 1m naoh solution the separated organic fractions are analyzed for water quality parameters such as toc cod uv absorbance etc another study separated leachate organics into only hydrophobic and hydrophilic fractions by solid phase extraction spe bolyard and reinhart 2017 in spe a leachate is first filtered through a 0 45 μm filter to remove the suspended particles the solution is then passed through a packed xad 8 resin column to separate the hydrophobics and hydrophilics the adsorbed hydrophobic fraction from the resin column is re dissolved by back eluting with 0 1m naoh solution while the hydrophilic fraction passes through the resin column to be collected bolyard and reinhart 2017 several analytical techniques have been employed for characterizing uvqs in landfill leachates of those size based separation is performed with ultrafiltration or gel filtration chromatography gfc at different molecular weight cutoffs mwco wang et al 2016 zhao et al 2012 2013a elemental analysis is performed by using an elemental analyzer christensen et al 1998 kang et al 2002 spectroscopic properties are measured with a spectrophotometer chai et al 2013 cui et al 2016 all these analyses are associated with different parameters for characterizing the organic fractions of leachate in table 2 the analytical techniques and associated parameters are described in detail for characterizing leachate uvqs 2 4 effects of uvqs because of the complex chemical structure and continuous evolution with time section 2 1 2 2 uvqs are recalcitrant and can strongly absorb uv light the strong uv absorbance by leachate uvqs is attributed to the presence of different aromatic moieties e g phenolic benzoic aniline etc that absorb uv light because of the π π electron transitions in the range of 200 380 nm chin et al 1994 weishaar et al 2003 among the different uvqs ha have the highest specific uv absorbance suva followed by fa and hpi fig 2 baccot et al 2017 gupta et al 2014b zhao et al 2013a although ha and fa possess the highest suva hpi contribute slightly more than half to the total uv absorbance owing to their higher concentration gupta et al 2014b zhao et al 2013a metals e g especially fe associated with humic substances can also contribute to the uv absorbance of leachate martensson et al 1999 qu et al 2008 xi et al 2012 because of this uv absorption by leachate the effectiveness of uv disinfection is diminished due to the decreased uv transmittance uvt for effective disinfection the uvt of a wastewater stream entering an uv disinfection process should be in the range of 60 65 or higher and the uv absorbance uva needs to be less than 0 187 cm 1 uvt 10 uva 100 nwri 2012 as most uvqs will pass through biological treatment processes without being removed huo et al 2009 they can interfere with the downstream uv disinfection process causing ineffective disinfection bolyard 2016 bolyard et al 2018a reinhart and bolyard 2015 zhao et al 2013a this uv quenching by leachate may also affect args removal by uv disinfection during co treatment previous studies have shown significantly positive correlations among ha metals co cu zn args and mobile genetic elements mges because of arg sorption on ha surface wu et al 2017 xu et al 2016 yu et al 2016 the association of args with leachate organics would make leachate treatment challenging as leachate organics can quench uv light and result in ineffective args removal in addition the presence of leachate organics especially humic substances during chlorination disinfection can create issues such as disinfection by products dbps formation nikolaou et al 2004 molecular weight and the degree of aromaticity of aquatic humic substances determine the amount of dbps formed during chlorination reckhow et al 1990 because uvqs are aromatic and contain nitrogen the potential of carbonaceous and nitrogenous dbps formation is high bhatnagar and sillanpää 2017 mitch and sedlak 2004 westgate and park 2010 3 treatment of uvqs 3 1 biological treatment biological treatment of landfill leachate can be conducted in either aerobic or anaerobic reactors and the effectiveness of biological treatments largely depends upon the type and composition of leachate driskill et al 2015 young leachates which are high in volatile fatty acids and biodegradable organics are more suitable for biological treatment compared to mature leachates that are mostly comprised of the recalcitrant portion of the organics kjeldsen et al 2002 renou et al 2008 aerobic biological treatment mainly includes activated sludge and fixed film bioreactors the decrease of uv absorbance and uvqs as toc after aerobic biological treatment can vary from 2 5 to 55 and 26 60 with an average of 22 7 and 44 respectively fig 3 the average decrease of ha fa and hpi concentrations in terms of toc after biological treatments is found to be 50 2 53 9 and 50 1 respectively while the removals of uv absorbance for the respective fractions were 43 5 23 and 19 5 fig 3 biological treatment is less effective in reducing uv absorbance than in reducing toc likely related to the ineffectiveness of biological treatment for recalcitrant organics mainly humic substances this could result in a rise in the suva value driskill et al 2015 zhao et al 2013a for example after biological treatment the suva values of ha fa hpi and raw leachate increased from 2 77 to 4 40 l mg 1 m 1 1 92 3 25 l mg 1 m 1 1 55 2 05 l mg 1 m 1 and 2 51 3 15 l mg 1 m 1 respectively bolyard et al 2018b zhao et al 2013a the increase of suva aromaticity in a sequential batch reactor sbr could be caused by the condensation of simple aromatics into polycondensed aromatic structures jouraiphy et al 2005 and generation of complex soluble microbial products smps with high molecular weights westerhoff and pinney 2000 however polydispersity d mw mn gellerstedt 1992 decreased for the organic fractions after sbr treatment because of the consumption of lower molecular weight organics i e volatile fatty acids amino acids by bacteria and absorption of higher molecular weight organics to activated sludge solids bolyard et al 2018b bu et al 2010a anaerobic biological treatment of leachate has a limited ability to remove organics and uv absorbance for example a two stage anaerobic membrane bioreactor consisted of thermophilic 55 2 c and mesophilic 37 1 c phases removed 39 of ha 37 of fa and 55 of hpi fraction from a landfill leachate while the removal of toc was slightly over 50 and uv absorbance removal was 46 pathak et al 2018 in an anammox process of the total reduction of doc from 288 to 136 mgl 1 33 was contributed by ha and 57 by fa suggesting the susceptibility of fa over ha in this treatment liang et al 2009 because of the ineffectiveness of standalone biological treatments combined biological and physicochemical treatments have been investigated to enhance the removal of uvqs for example incorporation of powdered activated carbon pac with an activated sludge process improved the organics removal for ha from 41 to 59 8 fa from 40 to 44 2 and hpi from 27 to 53 1 zhao et al 2013a membrane separation is an effective post treatment method to lower the uv absorbance of landfill leachates zhao et al 2013a due to the higher average molecular weight of ha and fa nanofiltration nf following biological treatment was able to elevate the uv transmittance of leachate sewage blended streams from 35 to 62 when leachate constituted 5 of the total volumetric flow zhao et al 2012 2013a although biological treatment processes are generally low cost and environmentally compatible their treatment efficiency for uvqs is limited the uv absorbance decrease in a leachate after biological treatment is always lower than the decrease of the uvqs concentration in terms of toc as a result recalcitrant leachate organics can penetrate through biological treatment and pose negative effects on the subsequent disinfection process appropriate incorporation of chemical physical and or physicochemical treatment with biological treatment should offer a feasible solution to control uvqs 3 2 chemical treatment chemical treatment of leachate uvqs can be conducted by chemical oxidation e g fenton ozone percarbonate and or coagulation flocculation on average chemical treatments have demonstrated the uv absorbance decrease of 46 and uvqs removal of 51 in term of toc fig 3 chemical treatments such as fenton s oxidation are very effective and could achieve an average removal of 84 5 uv absorbance and 67 4 uvqs in term of toc from leachate gupta et al 2014a jung et al 2017 moravia et al 2013 wu et al 2011 while treatments such as ozone can achieve a 65 uv absorbance decrease only 5 6 30 of uvqs removal in term of toc was achieved mainly because of its selective reaction with hydrophobic compounds which subsequently transform to hydrophilic smaller molecular weight fraction after ozone treatment fig 4 jung et al 2017 wang et al 2016 wu et al 2004 for example 100 decrease of ha 16 2 decrease of fa and 78 increase of hpi fraction was observed after ozone treatment wang et al 2016 likewise as demonstrated in fig 5 the uv absorbance of the hpi fraction after ozone treatment did not change possibly because of the recalcitrance of the hpi to ozone or interconversion of the hydrophobic fractions to the hydrophilic fraction due to this the contribution of the hpi to the total uv absorbance increased from 41 to 93 after ozone treatment fig 5 also the polydispersity index increased from 2 9 to 15 6 after ozonation of leachate indicating a broader molecular weight distribution of leachate organics with ozonation wang et al 2016 to improve the performance of ozone treatment combination of ozonation with other treatments e g ozone uv ozone h2o2 ozone persulfate has been investigated and exhibited improved uvqs removals for instance from 8 to 23 with ozone uv treatment soubh and mokhtarani 2016 wang et al 2017 a disadvantage of ozone based treatment is the large consumption of electricity during ozone generation chemical oxidation mainly works on the principle of interconversion of leachate uvqs during treatment for example fenton removes most of the hydrophobic ha and fa by converting them into the hpi fraction jung et al 2017 xu et al 2017 zhao et al 2013b the possible pathway of such conversions is via the nonselective reaction of oh radicals with both hydrophobic and hydrophilic compounds fig 4 cataldo and angelini 2012 jung et al 2017 the total toc removal after fenton treatment was reported to be less than the cod and humic substances removal indicating that some of the organics were converted into intermediates after fenton treatment wu et al 2010a 2010b these smaller sized intermediates with fewer carboxylic groups than initial humic substances are more susceptible to oxidation than original molecules and exert less cod after treatment wang et al 2016 a broad range of intermediates during the degradation of ha and fa can be utilized as a carbon source for bacteria as a result of increased biodegradability of leachates by fenton treatment wang et al 2017 to improve the performance different types of fenton processes such as solar photo fenton and iron oxide coated gac assisted fenton fegac h2o2 have been investigated for removing leachate uvqs and were able to achieve the removal of 80 85 humic substances fan et al 2007 silva et al 2013 fenton was also coupled with sbr for leachate treatment and in this system fenton removed high molecular weight aromatic rings and conjugated moieties while the sbr removed low molecular weight fractions carboxylic acids and proteins liu et al 2015 fenton treatment though a strong and effective chemical oxidation process for uvqs removal has issues such as high reagent cost sludge production and foaming during the initial ph adjustment other chemical oxidation processes have also been studied for treating landfill leachate uvqs with varied performances for example sodium percarbonate oxidation of leachate was able to remove 8 43 4 uv absorbance and 15 1 15 6 uvqs as toc iskander et al 2017a microwave assisted persulfate oxidation was ineffective to remove recalcitrant aromatics resulting in the increase of the suva value from 1 5 to the range of 2 3 14 7 l mg 1 m 1 kim and ahn 2017 coagulation flocculation and lime treatment could achieve the removal of some uvqs 21 71 1 of ha 21 37 of fa and 53 of hpi fraction amokrane et al 1997 liao and randtke 1986 wu et al 2011 zheng et al 2009 in addition several unconventional technologies have been investigated for leachate treatment for instance a bioflocculant successfully removed 85 of ha and produced less sludge than conventional chemical coagulant al2 so4 3 zouboulis et al 2004 the combination of a collector 70 mg l 1 n cetyl n n n trimethylammonium bromide a frother 1 ethanol and flotation was able to remove 99 of ha from a simulated landfill leachate zouboulis et al 2003 subcritical water catalytic oxidation zhai et al 2016 catalyzed wet air oxidation wang et al 2014 and photocatalytic degradation wiszniowski et al 2004 also showed promising performance of leachate uvqs treatment with removal of 49 93 of ha and 75 87 of toc in general the potential applications of those treatment methods are limited by the high chemical cost 3 3 physical treatment physical treatments are mostly membrane separation and sorption based techniques such as resin separation in general physical treatments have exhibited removals of 23 97 average 77 uv absorbance and 34 98 average 65 8 uvqs in terms of toc fig 3 membrane separation that works on the size exclusion principle includes reverse osmosis ro forward osmosis fo nanofiltration nf ultrafiltration uf and microfiltration mf amaral et al 2015b huo et al 2009 iskander et al 2017c zhao et al 2013a zolfaghari et al 2017 huo et al 2009 reported that an ro process was able to remove 100 ha 99 7 fa and 98 4 hpi from a biologically treated leachate fo could remove 98 uvqs in terms of toc from landfill leachate during water recovery iskander et al 2017c a removal efficiency of 43 for toc by combined lime precipitation 8 g l 1 lime and mf was reported for humic substances from landfill leachate while nf increased the removal to 86 amaral et al 2015b this removal corresponded to 23 uv absorbance reduction by the mf treatment and 74 reduction of uv absorbance by the nf treatment amaral et al 2015b in a uf based membrane bioreactor a removal of 60 ha 11 fa and 40 hpi was obtained zolfaghari et al 2017 another study on uf demonstrated a removal of 15 19 uv absorbance after filtration of biologically treated leachates with 100 kda 0 7 μm mwco while the removal increased to 54 65 with a mwco of 1 kda 0 007 μm the improved overall removal of uv absorbance from 100 kda to 1 kda uf was largely contributed by the reduction of ha and fa fig 6 when 0 5 kda 0 004 μm mwco was employed further overall uv absorbance removal was mainly contributed by the removal of hpi fig 6 and this demonstrated the susceptibility of ha and fa to membrane separation because of their larger mw than that of the hpi fraction gupta et al 2014b zhao et al 2013a thus the performance of uf largely depends on the mwcos used during treatment although most membrane separation technologies are effective for removing leachate uvqs there are concerns due to membrane fouling along with the concentrated brine handling and disposal amaral et al 2015a tang et al 2007 the presence of uvqs can increase membrane fouling it was reported that a decrease of 18 water flux was observed in a ro unit after an addition of 50 mgl 1 ha in the feed stream sir et al 2012 among emerging physical separation methods magnetic ion anion exchange resin miex has demonstrated a removal of 57 uv absorbance from landfill leachate at a dose of 40 ml l 1 of miex cl for 20 min mixing boyer et al 2011 carbon nanotubes cnts exhibited preferential absorption of ha in the molecular weight range of 0 5 2 kda and fa in the molecular weight range of 1 3 kda ateia et al 2017 gac could achieve good removal of uvqs for example a removal of 89 1 uv absorbance and 65 5 toc from a microbial fuel cell mfc treated leachate effluent using 40 g l 1 gac for 6 h was observed iskander et al 2017b similarly powdered activated carbon pac demonstrated a high uv absorbance removal 92 as gac with a preferential adsorption of hydrophobic fractions ha and fa deng et al 2018 the application of sorption based physical separation is limited by the regeneration of adsorbents in addition the uvqs removed by physical treatment methods are not destroyed but separated 3 4 electrochemical treatment electrochemical treatments mainly consist of electrocoagulation electro oxidation and electron beam radiation and can have an average removal of 72 5 33 5 89 5 uv absorbance and 68 5 57 80 uvqs in terms of toc fig 3 electrocoagulation involves the production of metal cations from a sacrificing anode electrode under an external electric field current or voltage cations are subsequently hydrolyzed and polymerized with increased surface area and aggregate or absorb organics to be removed as a settled or floated sludge fig 7 song et al 2017 direct electro oxidation of leachate uvqs happens on an anode electrode while in indirect electro oxidation anodically created oxidants e g chlorine hypochlorite are responsible for oxidizing leachate uvqs deng and englehardt 2007 electro oxidation and electrocoagulation are most effective in removing larger molecular weight humic substances dia et al 2017 shao et al 2006 for example electrocoagulation removed 100 ha from a landfill leachate and benefited from the electrostatic attraction between positively charged metal hydroxides and negative functional groups hydroxyl and carboxylic groups of humic substances fig 7 dia et al 2017 although the removal of the hpi fraction is less 37 electrocoagulation is effective in removing smaller colloidal particles because of the external electric field that puts the particles in motion and increases the coagulation removal by forming flocs kliaugaite et al 2013 the effectiveness of electrochemical methods largely depends on the intensity of the applied current or voltage for example increasing the current density from 450 to 600 am 2 during electro oxidation of leachate resulted in an increase of uvqs removal from 75 to 95 in 8 h anglada et al 2009 a potential difference between chemical oxidation and electrochemical methods e g electrocoagulation and electro oxidation is that the hpi fraction may increase after chemical oxidation section 3 2 but decreases after electrochemical treatment likely because the ha and fa fractions do not degrade to smaller molecular weight hpi fraction during electrochemical treatments dia et al 2017 several new electrochemical treatments have been reported high voltage pulsed discharge hvpd combined with tio2 zhang et al 2017 and electron beam radiation bae et al 1999 have demonstrated excellent performance in reducing uv absorbance and uvqs electrolytic reduction can help downstream activated carbon treatment of ha as it reduces the surface tension became more hydrophobic and makes them susceptible to adsorption satyawali et al 2007 electrochemical processes have also been applied with uv irradiation to achieve the removal of 65 humic substances from biologically treated landfill leachate after 30 min of treatment xiao et al 2013 bioelectrochemical systems bes which operate on the principal of anaerobic degradation of organics were studied for leachate treatment iskander et al 2016 the studies reported 25 5 49 5 of uv absorbance decrease after bes treatment and the uvqs decrease ranged from 71 to 83 in terms of toc fig 3 iskander et al 2017b zhang et al 2015b higher hrt and higher current density could facilitate uvqs removal in bes fig 8 a iskander et al 2017b and this improvement was related to reduced organic loading rate and increased bioelectrochemical oxidation uv absorbance reduction by bes for the ha fa and hpi fractions was less than the corresponding toc concentration decrease and in turn the suva increased for example the ha fraction showed a suva increase from 0 46 to 4 99 l mg 1 m 1 fig 8b iskander et al 2017b zhao et al 2013a along with uvqs removal bes produced 0 123 kwhm 3 energy during leachate treatment iskander et al 2017b bes treatment of uvqs is still in its infancy and much understanding of the fate and transformation of uvqs during bes treatment is still to be obtained 4 perspectives the fractions of leachate uvqs exhibit different removal efficiencies humic substances ha and fa are easier to remove by physical and chemical methods because they are macromolecules with higher mw however the hpi fraction can contribute more than half of the total uv absorbance in leachate and is relatively difficult to remove little is known about their characteristics or composition those low mw and bio refractory hpi organics may be better removed by chemical treatment e g fenton if the high mw humic substances are removed beforehand because chemical treatment e g fenton ozone can increase the smaller mw hpi fraction due to interconversion of high mw ha and fa chemical treatment could be used as a pretreatment prior to electrochemical treatments such as electrocoagulation and electro oxidation which are effective in removing the hpi fraction chemical treatment could be performed prior to adsorption based treatments e g activated carbon to reduce the organic load on adsorbent materials thereby increasing their lifetime incorporating membrane as a post treatment method for example after chemical or electrochemical treatments could also increase membrane performance and extend the cycle times because of the potential for low fouling due to a lower organic loading nevertheless more investigations on leachate uvqs are needed for characterizing hpi and its behavior in biological and physicochemical treatment processes uv absorbance by recalcitrant leachate organics lingering in wwtp effluents can have disastrous consequences for disinfection a prime example occurred at a wwtp in richmond va which was incapacitated in 2016 by receiving 0 2 0 4 mgd leachate 1 of daily wastewater flow collected by a third party from several landfills zhao et al 2016 a dilution of the leachate of 100 times or more with conventional influent was required to bring the uv transmittance of the final effluent within the acceptable range 65 for uv disinfection as a result the wwtp was penalized with noncompliance of its permit in terms of fecal coliform counts ultimately the richmond wwtp had to terminate leachate flow from all nine landfills to restore operation requiring the landfills to seek out alternative disposal options with little warning thus interference of uv disinfection by landfill leachate is a real and present problem for which awareness is emerging and consequences could be very serious if not addressed properly the uv quenching by leachate uvqs could be more prominent at small wwtps if they receive indirect leachate discharge i e leachate discharged to wwtps for treatment because of insufficient dilution during leachate sewage co treatment hence uv absorbance of leachate should be considered carefully along with nutrient content pretreatment is more desirable for reducing the effects of uvqs in wwtps for example onsite biological treatment may be considered because of relatively low cost compared to chemical physical treatments though limited treatment efficiency would be expected there is no standalone cost effective uvqs removal technology available and thus incorporation of multiple treatments would be necessary to meet the 60 65 uv transmittance requirement in wwtps because complete leachate treatment by chemical and electrochemical processes are limited by cost the incorporation of these with the widely practiced biological treatment to attain enhanced removal of uvqs needs further exploration the source separation of humic substance precursors can significantly improve the biodegradability of leachate in the cells landfills receiving an insignificant amount of lignocellulose for instance enhanced recycling of lignin rich waste yard waste wood or paperboard can help reduce the uvqs concentration in leachates biological treatment could be more effective and implemented for leachate from cells landfills with low uvqs concentrations because of higher biodegradability to facilitate data collection and improve our understanding of uvqs the studies of leachate uvqs should report data on key parameters such as uv absorbance toc concentration and suva for the unfractionated and fractionated samples i e ha fa hpi currently there is no pretreatment standard for indirectly discharged leachate from landfills in the nonhazardous subcategory although us epa is authorized by the clean water act cwa to create regulation standards on pollutants that interfere with or are incompatible with publicly owned treatment works it does not have any pretreatment standards for existing sources pses thus besides imposing pretreatment standards for existing facilities it is important to consider imposing pretreatment standards for new sources psns as newly constructed facilities would be able to incorporate best available treatment technologies to attain imposed pretreatment standards if a pretreatment standard can be incorporated for leachate the nonconventional pollutant toc and non listed pollutant uv absorbance should be considered along with the existing conventional pollutants bod5 tss and ph in the absence of regulations professionals and experts should use their best professional judgment and the impacts of leachate uvqs on uv disinfection in wwtps to come up with a standard for landfills discharging leachate to wwtps the regulation on new parameters may negatively affect the small operating landfills which may not be able to upgrade to attain the pretreatment discharge requirements this will demand subsidy for small operating landfills for technology upgrade 5 conclusions due to the uv quenching properties the leachate uvqs are found to reduce the efficacy of uv disinfection in wwtps thus it is important to understand the detailed effects of uvqs and develop cost effective treatment approaches the following conclusions can be made leachate organics ha fa and hpi can strongly absorb uv light and thus severely interfere with uv disinfection hence co treatment of landfill leachate along with sewage in wwtps can be affected by leachate induced uvqs during uv disinfection among the three organic fractions of landfill leachate the hpi contributes slightly more than half of the overall leachate uv absorbing capacity and the rest is by humic substances ha and fa however humic substances exhibit higher suva than hpi because of their complex polymeric structures the order of suva for the three organic fractions follows the trend of suvaha suvafa suvahpi biological treatment has limited effectiveness for uvqs removal because those compounds are resistant to biodegradation and would require process optimization to be applied successfully while physical separation such as membrane separation can effectively remove uvqs the performance of membrane separation of uvqs is dictated by the pore size of the membrane the smaller the pore size the more removal of uvqs the application of adsorption based treatment is limited by regeneration of the adsorbents once it is spent chemical treatment such as advanced oxidation e g fenton can be effective in reducing uvqs however it may increase the hpi fraction due to the conversion of humic substances ha fa to hpi the biodegradability of leachate may be increased after chemical treatment and thus benefits the subsequent biological treatments chemical treatments often have a high cost and complexity of operation electrocoagulation and electro oxidation can be effective in removing uvqs without increasing the hpi fraction the application of electrocoagulation is limited by the cost of electricity bioelectrochemical systems have shown some promise in leachate uvqs treatment a consensus is required among researchers about mandatory parameters that should be included in leachate studies uv absorbance and uvqs concentrations should be considered as a critical wastewater parameter the key parameters including ha fa and hpi concentrations and their respective uv absorbance need proper reporting in literature uv quenching by leachate organics is an issue that has not received the level of attention that it deserves as it could become a serious problem if not conceived with care landfills are in need of appropriate provisions for alternative treatments if wwtp effluent uv disinfection is problematic potentially requiring onsite treatments prior to discharge in wwtps going into the future it is important to environmental and public health for wwtps to be aware of the uv transmittance issue exerted by leachate organics acknowledgements this work was financially supported by two grants from the environmental research and education foundation development of a strategy for the treatment of landfill leachates 2013 2017 and an integrated leachate treatment system for removing contaminants and recovering resources 2015 2018 
19287,landfill leachate contains extremely diverse mixtures of pollutants and thus requires appropriate treatment before discharge co treatment of landfill leachate with sewage in wastewater treatment plants is a common approach because of low cost and convenience however some recalcitrant organic compounds in leachate can escape biological treatment processes lower the uv transmittance of waste streams due to their uv quenching properties and interfere with the associated disinfection efficacy thus the leachate uv quenching substances uvqs must be removed or reduced to a level that uv disinfection is not strongly affected uvqs consist of three major fractions humic acids fulvic acids and hydrophilics each of which has distinct characteristics and behaviors during treatment the purpose of this review is to provide a synthesis of the state of the science regarding uvqs and possible treatment approaches in general chemical electrochemical and physical treatments are more effective than biological treatments but also costlier integration of multiple treatment methods to target the removal of different fractions of uvqs can aid in optimizing treatment the importance of uvqs effects on wastewater treatment should be better recognized and understood with implemented regulations and improved research and treatment practice graphical abstract image 1 keywords landfill leachate uv absorbance uv quenchers uv disinfection recalcitrant organic carbon 1 introduction generation of solid waste is increasing globally due to both economic and population growth dang et al 2016 a world bank report predicted an increase of global waste generation from 1 3 to 2 2 billion tons by 2025 while the associated management cost was predicted to increase from 205 4 to 375 5 billion by 2025 hoornweg and bhada tata 2012 among the different municipal solid waste msw management approaches landfilling is the most common because of its low cost and relatively low maintenance requirements deng and englehardt 2006 for instance more than 80 and around 53 of the solid waste is disposed of in landfills in china and the u s respectively chai et al 2013 usepa 2016 during the process of stabilization the landfilled solid waste produces liquid waste called leachate via the infiltration of water from precipitation into the landfill and the moisture in the waste damiano et al 2014 ganesh and jambeck 2013 a ton of municipal solid waste can generate 0 05 0 2 tons of leachate in its lifetime during the process of landfilling kurniawan and lo 2009 maryana et al 2014 wang et al 2016 this leachate is a complex wastewater containing a vast array of pollutants which can result in major environmental impact and adverse human health risk if not contained and treated appropriately kjeldsen et al 2002 renou et al 2008 because of the complexity and wide variation of leachate dissolved organic carbon doc there is no single treatment process that works for all leachates comstock et al 2010 renou et al 2008 tatsi et al 2003 in the u s more than 60 of the landfills discharge leachate to wastewater treatment plants wwtps because of its low cost 0 04 per gallon and convenience

biodegradable organics from leachates with recalcitrant organic fractions left behind other methods such as physicochemical gupta et al 2014a jung et al 2017 electrochemical shao et al 2006 xiao et al 2013 and bioelectrochemical treatments iskander et al 2017b zhang et al 2015a are being explored as well leachate doc can vary with time having a concentration of 800 20000 mg l 1 huo et al 2008 2009 kang et al 2002 mohammadzadeh et al 2005 these organics can be converted from low molecular weight aliphatic compounds into high molecular weight aromatic compounds due to condensation and polymerization of byproducts from microbial degradation bolyard and reinhart 2017 the high molecular weight aromatic compounds are generally hydrophobic consisting mainly of humic substances e g humic and fulvic acids the low molecular weight aliphatic compounds are mostly hydrophilic both low and high molecular weight substances in municipal solid waste landfill leachates can strongly absorb uv light those substances are usually refractory in most treatment processes of wwtps and can eventually interfere with the downstream uv disinfection process zhao et al 2013a due to their uv quenching abilities these substances are collectively called ultraviolet quenching substances uvqs uv quenching by leachate organics which is synonymous with to put out the uv light can have an adverse effect on disinfection even if landfill leachate constitutes as low as 0 1 of the total flow into a municipal wwtp bolyard 2016 bolyard et al 2018a reinhart and bolyard 2015 in addition uv disinfection can become ineffective in removing antibiotic resistance genes args as args can be absorbed on humic acids surfaces during uv treatment yu et al 2016 leachate organics can also stimulate the production of carcinogenic disinfection byproducts dbps i e haloacetic acid haloalkanes if organics are present at a concentration over 2 mg l 1 during chlorination disinfection nikolaou et al 2004 therefore it is evident that the addition of complex landfill leachate into municipal wastewater treatment systems poses a serious challenge to wastewater treatment performance it is imperative to develop effective treatment approaches to reduce uvqs to an acceptable level before routing it to wastewater treatment facilities this requires a better understanding of properties and chemical characteristics of uvqs along with their behaviors in different treatment practices the purpose of this review is to provide a detailed introduction of landfill leachate induced uvqs with respect to source formation and characteristics a comprehensive evaluation of the current status of leachate treatment for uvqs removal and in depth discussion of the perspectives of uvqs control for wastewater treatment 2 characteristics of uvqs 2 1 formation the uvqs of leachate contain hydrophilic fraction hpi and hydrophobic humic substances humic acids ha and fulvic acids fa hydrophilic aliphatic carbons are formed through the decomposition of organic solid wastes within a landfill while humic substances are formed through complex biological and chemical reactions by a humification process castagnoli et al 1990 jones and bryan 1998 several reaction pathways on humification involving lignin polyphenols and sugar amines condensation have been proposed jones and bryan 1998 lignin is abundantly present in paper and paperboard wood leaves and other vegetation and acts as a precursor for humic substances in landfills according to a usepa report paper and paperboard 14 3 yard trimmings 7 9 and wood 8 1 accounted for approximately 30 3 of the total landfilled msw in 2014 thereby serving as sources of lignin usepa 2016 the process of humification may also be aided by proteins carbohydrates and fatty acids present in food wastes which made up 21 6 of the disposed msw into landfills in 2014 usepa 2016 because of the wide variety of precursors e g lignin proteins carbohydrates and fatty acids source materials e g paper and paperboard wood vegetation and food waste and environmental conditions humic substances in landfill leachate differ significantly in terms of chemical structures and properties castagnoli et al 1990 ratasuk and nanny 2007 tahiri et al 2016 humic substances are structurally heterogeneous macromolecules yellow to black in color and acidic in nature specifically they are covalently bonded agglomerates of aliphatic i e hydrophilic fraction and aromatic moieties that contain phenolic carboxyl alkoxy and amido groups along with occasional presence of sulphate esters phosphate esters semiquinone and hydroquinone groups castagnoli et al 1990 jones and bryan 1998 the hydrophobicity of humic substances might also be enhanced by the presence of carboxyl rich alicyclic molecules and material derived from linear terpenoids i e terpenoids contain five carbon isoprene units lam et al 2007 humic substances grow in size by incorporating smaller fractions using c o c c van der waals π π ch π and hydrogen bonds dec and bollag 2000 freeman et al 2001 jones and bryan 1998 piccolo 2002 piccolo et al 2000 heterogeneity of humic substances in leachates and difficulty in characterizing them are largely attributed to their progressive change with age nanny and ratasuk 2002 it is believed that in a young leachate fa are formed first and thus their concentration could be higher than that of ha artiola fortuny and fuller 1982 kang et al 2002 nanny and ratasuk 2002 however with humification ha concentration increases with time and eventually decreases as landfills become stable and natural degradation and or dilution takes place artiola fortuny and fuller 1982 nanny and ratasuk 2002 considering the long exposure of the precursors to water oxygen and radiation i e sunlight humic substances are often considered the final products of the bio degradative and oxidative pathways jones and bryan 1998 due to this humic substances are considered as old molecules that are resistant to further biological treatment and susceptible to specific treatments i e advanced oxidation that they have not experienced before jones and bryan 1998 additionally the multiple redox states and reversibility of redox sites in humic substances increase its recalcitrance to microbial oxidation ratasuk and nanny 2007 biodegradable organic matter including volatile fatty acids is formed through the initial decomposition of organic solid waste such as food scraps they are usually aliphatic structures and fractionated as a part of hpi bolyard and reinhart 2017 due to this simple carbon chained structure they are susceptible to microbial degradation and contribute significantly to the readily biodegradable chemical oxygen demand cod and biochemical oxygen demand bod especially in raw fresh leachates however they only contribute a small portion 10 on average of the overall uv absorbance of leachates zhao et al 2013a in addition this biodegradable organic matter can be easily removed in the biological treatment processes in wwtps before entering the downstream uv disinfection system and thus is usually not a significant issue for uv disinfection in wwtps 2 2 composition leachate uvqs measured as toc mainly consist of ha fa and hpi fractions the ratio of which is highly variable and depends on many factors such as waste type operating conditions and landfill age the percentages of ha fa and hpi fractions vary at 2 1 44 7 72 and 24 9 70 1 of doc respectively table 1 gupta et al 2014b nanny and ratasuk 2002 zhang et al 2009 2013 the molecular weight of humic substances ranges from low less than 500 to 2000 g mol 1 for fa to high 50 000 to 100 000 g mol 1 for ha while the typical molecular weight of the hpi fraction is similar to that of fa amaral et al 2015b kang et al 2002 zhang et al 2009 because of the wide distribution and the aggregation properties of humic substances it is difficult to find the real size of a humic structure jones and bryan 1998 according to a previous study hydrophobic humic substances are more polydisperse polydispersity index 1 while hydrophilic fractions are more monodisperse polydispersity index 1 with the presence of homogeneous compounds in hydrophilic fractions and heterogeneous compounds in hydrophobic fractions table 1 seo et al 2007 leachate ha have a higher content of c h and n and a lower content of o than those of fa and hpi fractions kang et al 2002 in turn the o c ratio in fa is higher than that in ha implying that fa have a higher proportion of o alkyl and carboxylic acid functional groups table 1 huo et al 2009 the carboxylic acidities of ha are lower than those of fa and hpi while the phenolic acidities of ha are higher than those of fa christensen et al 1998 due to the presence of a relatively small amount of ionizable carboxylic acid groups along with a substantial amount of aliphatic and aromatic moieties ha can easily agglomerate and precipitate upon charge neutralization at ph 2 while fa are soluble at all ph range jones and bryan 1998 sometimes ha show a high value of o c ratio because of the presence of a higher carbohydrate content christensen et al 1998 for this reason the ratio of o c can often be misleading if used to compare the carboxylic acid content in organic fractions the n content of the organics typically follows a pattern of ha hpi fa and ha and hpi can have doubled n content compared to fa huo et al 2009 the low value of h c 1 suggests predominantly aromatic structures and the order of the h c ratio is ha fa hpi indicating that hydrophilics are more aliphatic than hydrophobics table 1 christensen et al 1998 huo et al 2008 2 3 separation and quantification of uvqs the hydrophilic and hydrophobic fractions of leachate uvqs can be fractionated using different nonionic or ionic cationic and anionic resin adsorption methods these fractionation procedures are time consuming and prone to cross contamination if not carefully handled imai et al 2001 most of the studies on fractionation of uvqs in landfill leachate focused on ha fa and hpi fractions ma et al 2001 a detailed speciation process is illustrated in fig 1 in this process a leachate sample is firstly filtered to remove suspended particles membranes with pore sizes from 0 45 μm to 1 5 μm have been employed for this purpose gupta et al 2014b seo et al 2007 thurman and malcolm 1981 after that a concentrated inorganic acid i e sulfuric or hydrochloric acid is added to precipitate the ha fraction at ph 2 dia et al 2017 the solution containing the precipitates is then centrifuged or filtered to separate the precipitated ha the separated ha can be re dissolved in a 0 1m naoh solution for further analysis the supernatant after separating the precipitated ha contains the fa and hpi fractions and is then passed through a xad 8 resin column where the fa fraction is adsorbed on the resin more details about xad 8 resin cleaning methods can be found in several previous studies leenheer 1981 ma et al 2001 thurman and malcolm 1981 the portion of the supernatant that passes through the resin column contains the hpi fraction the adsorbed fa fraction can be back eluted by a 0 1m naoh solution the separated organic fractions are analyzed for water quality parameters such as toc cod uv absorbance etc another study separated leachate organics into only hydrophobic and hydrophilic fractions by solid phase extraction spe bolyard and reinhart 2017 in spe a leachate is first filtered through a 0 45 μm filter to remove the suspended particles the solution is then passed through a packed xad 8 resin column to separate the hydrophobics and hydrophilics the adsorbed hydrophobic fraction from the resin column is re dissolved by back eluting with 0 1m naoh solution while the hydrophilic fraction passes through the resin column to be collected bolyard and reinhart 2017 several analytical techniques have been employed for characterizing uvqs in landfill leachates of those size based separation is performed with ultrafiltration or gel filtration chromatography gfc at different molecular weight cutoffs mwco wang et al 2016 zhao et al 2012 2013a elemental analysis is performed by using an elemental analyzer christensen et al 1998 kang et al 2002 spectroscopic properties are measured with a spectrophotometer chai et al 2013 cui et al 2016 all these analyses are associated with different parameters for characterizing the organic fractions of leachate in table 2 the analytical techniques and associated parameters are described in detail for characterizing leachate uvqs 2 4 effects of uvqs because of the complex chemical structure and continuous evolution with time section 2 1 2 2 uvqs are recalcitrant and can strongly absorb uv light the strong uv absorbance by leachate uvqs is attributed to the presence of different aromatic moieties e g phenolic benzoic aniline etc that absorb uv light because of the π π electron transitions in the range of 200 380 nm chin et al 1994 weishaar et al 2003 among the different uvqs ha have the highest specific uv absorbance suva followed by fa and hpi fig 2 baccot et al 2017 gupta et al 2014b zhao et al 2013a although ha and fa possess the highest suva hpi contribute slightly more than half to the total uv absorbance owing to their higher concentration gupta et al 2014b zhao et al 2013a metals e g especially fe associated with humic substances can also contribute to the uv absorbance of leachate martensson et al 1999 qu et al 2008 xi et al 2012 because of this uv absorption by leachate the effectiveness of uv disinfection is diminished due to the decreased uv transmittance uvt for effective disinfection the uvt of a wastewater stream entering an uv disinfection process should be in the range of 60 65 or higher and the uv absorbance uva needs to be less than 0 187 cm 1 uvt 10 uva 100 nwri 2012 as most uvqs will pass through biological treatment processes without being removed huo et al 2009 they can interfere with the downstream uv disinfection process causing ineffective disinfection bolyard 2016 bolyard et al 2018a reinhart and bolyard 2015 zhao et al 2013a this uv quenching by leachate may also affect args removal by uv disinfection during co treatment previous studies have shown significantly positive correlations among ha metals co cu zn args and mobile genetic elements mges because of arg sorption on ha surface wu et al 2017 xu et al 2016 yu et al 2016 the association of args with leachate organics would make leachate treatment challenging as leachate organics can quench uv light and result in ineffective args removal in addition the presence of leachate organics especially humic substances during chlorination disinfection can create issues such as disinfection by products dbps formation nikolaou et al 2004 molecular weight and the degree of aromaticity of aquatic humic substances determine the amount of dbps formed during chlorination reckhow et al 1990 because uvqs are aromatic and contain nitrogen the potential of carbonaceous and nitrogenous dbps formation is high bhatnagar and sillanpää 2017 mitch and sedlak 2004 westgate and park 2010 3 treatment of uvqs 3 1 biological treatment biological treatment of landfill leachate can be conducted in either aerobic or anaerobic reactors and the effectiveness of biological treatments largely depends upon the type and composition of leachate driskill et al 2015 young leachates which are high in volatile fatty acids and biodegradable organics are more suitable for biological treatment compared to mature leachates that are mostly comprised of the recalcitrant portion of the organics kjeldsen et al 2002 renou et al 2008 aerobic biological treatment mainly includes activated sludge and fixed film bioreactors the decrease of uv absorbance and uvqs as toc after aerobic biological treatment can vary from 2 5 to 55 and 26 60 with an average of 22 7 and 44 respectively fig 3 the average decrease of ha fa and hpi concentrations in terms of toc after biological treatments is found to be 50 2 53 9 and 50 1 respectively while the removals of uv absorbance for the respective fractions were 43 5 23 and 19 5 fig 3 biological treatment is less effective in reducing uv absorbance than in reducing toc likely related to the ineffectiveness of biological treatment for recalcitrant organics mainly humic substances this could result in a rise in the suva value driskill et al 2015 zhao et al 2013a for example after biological treatment the suva values of ha fa hpi and raw leachate increased from 2 77 to 4 40 l mg 1 m 1 1 92 3 25 l mg 1 m 1 1 55 2 05 l mg 1 m 1 and 2 51 3 15 l mg 1 m 1 respectively bolyard et al 2018b zhao et al 2013a the increase of suva aromaticity in a sequential batch reactor sbr could be caused by the condensation of simple aromatics into polycondensed aromatic structures jouraiphy et al 2005 and generation of complex soluble microbial products smps with high molecular weights westerhoff and pinney 2000 however polydispersity d mw mn gellerstedt 1992 decreased for the organic fractions after sbr treatment because of the consumption of lower molecular weight organics i e volatile fatty acids amino acids by bacteria and absorption of higher molecular weight organics to activated sludge solids bolyard et al 2018b bu et al 2010a anaerobic biological treatment of leachate has a limited ability to remove organics and uv absorbance for example a two stage anaerobic membrane bioreactor consisted of thermophilic 55 2 c and mesophilic 37 1 c phases removed 39 of ha 37 of fa and 55 of hpi fraction from a landfill leachate while the removal of toc was slightly over 50 and uv absorbance removal was 46 pathak et al 2018 in an anammox process of the total reduction of doc from 288 to 136 mgl 1 33 was contributed by ha and 57 by fa suggesting the susceptibility of fa over ha in this treatment liang et al 2009 because of the ineffectiveness of standalone biological treatments combined biological and physicochemical treatments have been investigated to enhance the removal of uvqs for example incorporation of powdered activated carbon pac with an activated sludge process improved the organics removal for ha from 41 to 59 8 fa from 40 to 44 2 and hpi from 27 to 53 1 zhao et al 2013a membrane separation is an effective post treatment method to lower the uv absorbance of landfill leachates zhao et al 2013a due to the higher average molecular weight of ha and fa nanofiltration nf following biological treatment was able to elevate the uv transmittance of leachate sewage blended streams from 35 to 62 when leachate constituted 5 of the total volumetric flow zhao et al 2012 2013a although biological treatment processes are generally low cost and environmentally compatible their treatment efficiency for uvqs is limited the uv absorbance decrease in a leachate after biological treatment is always lower than the decrease of the uvqs concentration in terms of toc as a result recalcitrant leachate organics can penetrate through biological treatment and pose negative effects on the subsequent disinfection process appropriate incorporation of chemical physical and or physicochemical treatment with biological treatment should offer a feasible solution to control uvqs 3 2 chemical treatment chemical treatment of leachate uvqs can be conducted by chemical oxidation e g fenton ozone percarbonate and or coagulation flocculation on average chemical treatments have demonstrated the uv absorbance decrease of 46 and uvqs removal of 51 in term of toc fig 3 chemical treatments such as fenton s oxidation are very effective and could achieve an average removal of 84 5 uv absorbance and 67 4 uvqs in term of toc from leachate gupta et al 2014a jung et al 2017 moravia et al 2013 wu et al 2011 while treatments such as ozone can achieve a 65 uv absorbance decrease only 5 6 30 of uvqs removal in term of toc was achieved mainly because of its selective reaction with hydrophobic compounds which subsequently transform to hydrophilic smaller molecular weight fraction after ozone treatment fig 4 jung et al 2017 wang et al 2016 wu et al 2004 for example 100 decrease of ha 16 2 decrease of fa and 78 increase of hpi fraction was observed after ozone treatment wang et al 2016 likewise as demonstrated in fig 5 the uv absorbance of the hpi fraction after ozone treatment did not change possibly because of the recalcitrance of the hpi to ozone or interconversion of the hydrophobic fractions to the hydrophilic fraction due to this the contribution of the hpi to the total uv absorbance increased from 41 to 93 after ozone treatment fig 5 also the polydispersity index increased from 2 9 to 15 6 after ozonation of leachate indicating a broader molecular weight distribution of leachate organics with ozonation wang et al 2016 to improve the performance of ozone treatment combination of ozonation with other treatments e g ozone uv ozone h2o2 ozone persulfate has been investigated and exhibited improved uvqs removals for instance from 8 to 23 with ozone uv treatment soubh and mokhtarani 2016 wang et al 2017 a disadvantage of ozone based treatment is the large consumption of electricity during ozone generation chemical oxidation mainly works on the principle of interconversion of leachate uvqs during treatment for example fenton removes most of the hydrophobic ha and fa by converting them into the hpi fraction jung et al 2017 xu et al 2017 zhao et al 2013b the possible pathway of such conversions is via the nonselective reaction of oh radicals with both hydrophobic and hydrophilic compounds fig 4 cataldo and angelini 2012 jung et al 2017 the total toc removal after fenton treatment was reported to be less than the cod and humic substances removal indicating that some of the organics were converted into intermediates after fenton treatment wu et al 2010a 2010b these smaller sized intermediates with fewer carboxylic groups than initial humic substances are more susceptible to oxidation than original molecules and exert less cod after treatment wang et al 2016 a broad range of intermediates during the degradation of ha and fa can be utilized as a carbon source for bacteria as a result of increased biodegradability of leachates by fenton treatment wang et al 2017 to improve the performance different types of fenton processes such as solar photo fenton and iron oxide coated gac assisted fenton fegac h2o2 have been investigated for removing leachate uvqs and were able to achieve the removal of 80 85 humic substances fan et al 2007 silva et al 2013 fenton was also coupled with sbr for leachate treatment and in this system fenton removed high molecular weight aromatic rings and conjugated moieties while the sbr removed low molecular weight fractions carboxylic acids and proteins liu et al 2015 fenton treatment though a strong and effective chemical oxidation process for uvqs removal has issues such as high reagent cost sludge production and foaming during the initial ph adjustment other chemical oxidation processes have also been studied for treating landfill leachate uvqs with varied performances for example sodium percarbonate oxidation of leachate was able to remove 8 43 4 uv absorbance and 15 1 15 6 uvqs as toc iskander et al 2017a microwave assisted persulfate oxidation was ineffective to remove recalcitrant aromatics resulting in the increase of the suva value from 1 5 to the range of 2 3 14 7 l mg 1 m 1 kim and ahn 2017 coagulation flocculation and lime treatment could achieve the removal of some uvqs 21 71 1 of ha 21 37 of fa and 53 of hpi fraction amokrane et al 1997 liao and randtke 1986 wu et al 2011 zheng et al 2009 in addition several unconventional technologies have been investigated for leachate treatment for instance a bioflocculant successfully removed 85 of ha and produced less sludge than conventional chemical coagulant al2 so4 3 zouboulis et al 2004 the combination of a collector 70 mg l 1 n cetyl n n n trimethylammonium bromide a frother 1 ethanol and flotation was able to remove 99 of ha from a simulated landfill leachate zouboulis et al 2003 subcritical water catalytic oxidation zhai et al 2016 catalyzed wet air oxidation wang et al 2014 and photocatalytic degradation wiszniowski et al 2004 also showed promising performance of leachate uvqs treatment with removal of 49 93 of ha and 75 87 of toc in general the potential applications of those treatment methods are limited by the high chemical cost 3 3 physical treatment physical treatments are mostly membrane separation and sorption based techniques such as resin separation in general physical treatments have exhibited removals of 23 97 average 77 uv absorbance and 34 98 average 65 8 uvqs in terms of toc fig 3 membrane separation that works on the size exclusion principle includes reverse osmosis ro forward osmosis fo nanofiltration nf ultrafiltration uf and microfiltration mf amaral et al 2015b huo et al 2009 iskander et al 2017c zhao et al 2013a zolfaghari et al 2017 huo et al 2009 reported that an ro process was able to remove 100 ha 99 7 fa and 98 4 hpi from a biologically treated leachate fo could remove 98 uvqs in terms of toc from landfill leachate during water recovery iskander et al 2017c a removal efficiency of 43 for toc by combined lime precipitation 8 g l 1 lime and mf was reported for humic substances from landfill leachate while nf increased the removal to 86 amaral et al 2015b this removal corresponded to 23 uv absorbance reduction by the mf treatment and 74 reduction of uv absorbance by the nf treatment amaral et al 2015b in a uf based membrane bioreactor a removal of 60 ha 11 fa and 40 hpi was obtained zolfaghari et al 2017 another study on uf demonstrated a removal of 15 19 uv absorbance after filtration of biologically treated leachates with 100 kda 0 7 μm mwco while the removal increased to 54 65 with a mwco of 1 kda 0 007 μm the improved overall removal of uv absorbance from 100 kda to 1 kda uf was largely contributed by the reduction of ha and fa fig 6 when 0 5 kda 0 004 μm mwco was employed further overall uv absorbance removal was mainly contributed by the removal of hpi fig 6 and this demonstrated the susceptibility of ha and fa to membrane separation because of their larger mw than that of the hpi fraction gupta et al 2014b zhao et al 2013a thus the performance of uf largely depends on the mwcos used during treatment although most membrane separation technologies are effective for removing leachate uvqs there are concerns due to membrane fouling along with the concentrated brine handling and disposal amaral et al 2015a tang et al 2007 the presence of uvqs can increase membrane fouling it was reported that a decrease of 18 water flux was observed in a ro unit after an addition of 50 mgl 1 ha in the feed stream sir et al 2012 among emerging physical separation methods magnetic ion anion exchange resin miex has demonstrated a removal of 57 uv absorbance from landfill leachate at a dose of 40 ml l 1 of miex cl for 20 min mixing boyer et al 2011 carbon nanotubes cnts exhibited preferential absorption of ha in the molecular weight range of 0 5 2 kda and fa in the molecular weight range of 1 3 kda ateia et al 2017 gac could achieve good removal of uvqs for example a removal of 89 1 uv absorbance and 65 5 toc from a microbial fuel cell mfc treated leachate effluent using 40 g l 1 gac for 6 h was observed iskander et al 2017b similarly powdered activated carbon pac demonstrated a high uv absorbance removal 92 as gac with a preferential adsorption of hydrophobic fractions ha and fa deng et al 2018 the application of sorption based physical separation is limited by the regeneration of adsorbents in addition the uvqs removed by physical treatment methods are not destroyed but separated 3 4 electrochemical treatment electrochemical treatments mainly consist of electrocoagulation electro oxidation and electron beam radiation and can have an average removal of 72 5 33 5 89 5 uv absorbance and 68 5 57 80 uvqs in terms of toc fig 3 electrocoagulation involves the production of metal cations from a sacrificing anode electrode under an external electric field current or voltage cations are subsequently hydrolyzed and polymerized with increased surface area and aggregate or absorb organics to be removed as a settled or floated sludge fig 7 song et al 2017 direct electro oxidation of leachate uvqs happens on an anode electrode while in indirect electro oxidation anodically created oxidants e g chlorine hypochlorite are responsible for oxidizing leachate uvqs deng and englehardt 2007 electro oxidation and electrocoagulation are most effective in removing larger molecular weight humic substances dia et al 2017 shao et al 2006 for example electrocoagulation removed 100 ha from a landfill leachate and benefited from the electrostatic attraction between positively charged metal hydroxides and negative functional groups hydroxyl and carboxylic groups of humic substances fig 7 dia et al 2017 although the removal of the hpi fraction is less 37 electrocoagulation is effective in removing smaller colloidal particles because of the external electric field that puts the particles in motion and increases the coagulation removal by forming flocs kliaugaite et al 2013 the effectiveness of electrochemical methods largely depends on the intensity of the applied current or voltage for example increasing the current density from 450 to 600 am 2 during electro oxidation of leachate resulted in an increase of uvqs removal from 75 to 95 in 8 h anglada et al 2009 a potential difference between chemical oxidation and electrochemical methods e g electrocoagulation and electro oxidation is that the hpi fraction may increase after chemical oxidation section 3 2 but decreases after electrochemical treatment likely because the ha and fa fractions do not degrade to smaller molecular weight hpi fraction during electrochemical treatments dia et al 2017 several new electrochemical treatments have been reported high voltage pulsed discharge hvpd combined with tio2 zhang et al 2017 and electron beam radiation bae et al 1999 have demonstrated excellent performance in reducing uv absorbance and uvqs electrolytic reduction can help downstream activated carbon treatment of ha as it reduces the surface tension became more hydrophobic and makes them susceptible to adsorption satyawali et al 2007 electrochemical processes have also been applied with uv irradiation to achieve the removal of 65 humic substances from biologically treated landfill leachate after 30 min of treatment xiao et al 2013 bioelectrochemical systems bes which operate on the principal of anaerobic degradation of organics were studied for leachate treatment iskander et al 2016 the studies reported 25 5 49 5 of uv absorbance decrease after bes treatment and the uvqs decrease ranged from 71 to 83 in terms of toc fig 3 iskander et al 2017b zhang et al 2015b higher hrt and higher current density could facilitate uvqs removal in bes fig 8 a iskander et al 2017b and this improvement was related to reduced organic loading rate and increased bioelectrochemical oxidation uv absorbance reduction by bes for the ha fa and hpi fractions was less than the corresponding toc concentration decrease and in turn the suva increased for example the ha fraction showed a suva increase from 0 46 to 4 99 l mg 1 m 1 fig 8b iskander et al 2017b zhao et al 2013a along with uvqs removal bes produced 0 123 kwhm 3 energy during leachate treatment iskander et al 2017b bes treatment of uvqs is still in its infancy and much understanding of the fate and transformation of uvqs during bes treatment is still to be obtained 4 perspectives the fractions of leachate uvqs exhibit different removal efficiencies humic substances ha and fa are easier to remove by physical and chemical methods because they are macromolecules with higher mw however the hpi fraction can contribute more than half of the total uv absorbance in leachate and is relatively difficult to remove little is known about their characteristics or composition those low mw and bio refractory hpi organics may be better removed by chemical treatment e g fenton if the high mw humic substances are removed beforehand because chemical treatment e g fenton ozone can increase the smaller mw hpi fraction due to interconversion of high mw ha and fa chemical treatment could be used as a pretreatment prior to electrochemical treatments such as electrocoagulation and electro oxidation which are effective in removing the hpi fraction chemical treatment could be performed prior to adsorption based treatments e g activated carbon to reduce the organic load on adsorbent materials thereby increasing their lifetime incorporating membrane as a post treatment method for example after chemical or electrochemical treatments could also increase membrane performance and extend the cycle times because of the potential for low fouling due to a lower organic loading nevertheless more investigations on leachate uvqs are needed for characterizing hpi and its behavior in biological and physicochemical treatment processes uv absorbance by recalcitrant leachate organics lingering in wwtp effluents can have disastrous consequences for disinfection a prime example occurred at a wwtp in richmond va which was incapacitated in 2016 by receiving 0 2 0 4 mgd leachate 1 of daily wastewater flow collected by a third party from several landfills zhao et al 2016 a dilution of the leachate of 100 times or more with conventional influent was required to bring the uv transmittance of the final effluent within the acceptable range 65 for uv disinfection as a result the wwtp was penalized with noncompliance of its permit in terms of fecal coliform counts ultimately the richmond wwtp had to terminate leachate flow from all nine landfills to restore operation requiring the landfills to seek out alternative disposal options with little warning thus interference of uv disinfection by landfill leachate is a real and present problem for which awareness is emerging and consequences could be very serious if not addressed properly the uv quenching by leachate uvqs could be more prominent at small wwtps if they receive indirect leachate discharge i e leachate discharged to wwtps for treatment because of insufficient dilution during leachate sewage co treatment hence uv absorbance of leachate should be considered carefully along with nutrient content pretreatment is more desirable for reducing the effects of uvqs in wwtps for example onsite biological treatment may be considered because of relatively low cost compared to chemical physical treatments though limited treatment efficiency would be expected there is no standalone cost effective uvqs removal technology available and thus incorporation of multiple treatments would be necessary to meet the 60 65 uv transmittance requirement in wwtps because complete leachate treatment by chemical and electrochemical processes are limited by cost the incorporation of these with the widely practiced biological treatment to attain enhanced removal of uvqs needs further exploration the source separation of humic substance precursors can significantly improve the biodegradability of leachate in the cells landfills receiving an insignificant amount of lignocellulose for instance enhanced recycling of lignin rich waste yard waste wood or paperboard can help reduce the uvqs concentration in leachates biological treatment could be more effective and implemented for leachate from cells landfills with low uvqs concentrations because of higher biodegradability to facilitate data collection and improve our understanding of uvqs the studies of leachate uvqs should report data on key parameters such as uv absorbance toc concentration and suva for the unfractionated and fractionated samples i e ha fa hpi currently there is no pretreatment standard for indirectly discharged leachate from landfills in the nonhazardous subcategory although us epa is authorized by the clean water act cwa to create regulation standards on pollutants that interfere with or are incompatible with publicly owned treatment works it does not have any pretreatment standards for existing sources pses thus besides imposing pretreatment standards for existing facilities it is important to consider imposing pretreatment standards for new sources psns as newly constructed facilities would be able to incorporate best available treatment technologies to attain imposed pretreatment standards if a pretreatment standard can be incorporated for leachate the nonconventional pollutant toc and non listed pollutant uv absorbance should be considered along with the existing conventional pollutants bod5 tss and ph in the absence of regulations professionals and experts should use their best professional judgment and the impacts of leachate uvqs on uv disinfection in wwtps to come up with a standard for landfills discharging leachate to wwtps the regulation on new parameters may negatively affect the small operating landfills which may not be able to upgrade to attain the pretreatment discharge requirements this will demand subsidy for small operating landfills for technology upgrade 5 conclusions due to the uv quenching properties the leachate uvqs are found to reduce the efficacy of uv disinfection in wwtps thus it is important to understand the detailed effects of uvqs and develop cost effective treatment approaches the following conclusions can be made leachate organics ha fa and hpi can strongly absorb uv light and thus severely interfere with uv disinfection hence co treatment of landfill leachate along with sewage in wwtps can be affected by leachate induced uvqs during uv disinfection among the three organic fractions of landfill leachate the hpi contributes slightly more than half of the overall leachate uv absorbing capacity and the rest is by humic substances ha and fa however humic substances exhibit higher suva than hpi because of their complex polymeric structures the order of suva for the three organic fractions follows the trend of suvaha suvafa suvahpi biological treatment has limited effectiveness for uvqs removal because those compounds are resistant to biodegradation and would require process optimization to be applied successfully while physical separation such as membrane separation can effectively remove uvqs the performance of membrane separation of uvqs is dictated by the pore size of the membrane the smaller the pore size the more removal of uvqs the application of adsorption based treatment is limited by regeneration of the adsorbents once it is spent chemical treatment such as advanced oxidation e g fenton can be effective in reducing uvqs however it may increase the hpi fraction due to the conversion of humic substances ha fa to hpi the biodegradability of leachate may be increased after chemical treatment and thus benefits the subsequent biological treatments chemical treatments often have a high cost and complexity of operation electrocoagulation and electro oxidation can be effective in removing uvqs without increasing the hpi fraction the application of electrocoagulation is limited by the cost of electricity bioelectrochemical systems have shown some promise in leachate uvqs treatment a consensus is required among researchers about mandatory parameters that should be included in leachate studies uv absorbance and uvqs concentrations should be considered as a critical wastewater parameter the key parameters including ha fa and hpi concentrations and their respective uv absorbance need proper reporting in literature uv quenching by leachate organics is an issue that has not received the level of attention that it deserves as it could become a serious problem if not conceived with care landfills are in need of appropriate provisions for alternative treatments if wwtp effluent uv disinfection is problematic potentially requiring onsite treatments prior to discharge in wwtps going into the future it is important to environmental and public health for wwtps to be aware of the uv transmittance issue exerted by leachate organics acknowledgements this work was financially supported

19288,occurrence of residual endotoxin activity et in dialysis water and also tap water as its source is a matter of great concern to medical professionals conducting dialysis therapy at healthcare facilities hcfs the present study was performed to determine the occurrence and fate of the et at selected japanese drinking water purification plants and hcfs between 2014 and 2016 chemical coagulation and sedimentation rapid sand filtration and membrane filtration were highly effective to decrease both et dissolved in water free et and et bound to cells particles bound et moderate decreases in bound et and limited decreases in free et were observed by chlorination and ozonation bacterial activated carbon filtration was a major cause of significant increases in endotoxin activity during the course of drinking water purification process levels of residual et in water supplied to hcfs were strongly affected by their source waters and the configurations of water purification processes served microbial regrowth on the premises from water tanks to faucets at hcfs could also contribute to et increases in tap water graphical abstract image 1 keywords dialysis endotoxin healthcare facility water supply water purification 1 introduction endotoxins or lipopolysaccharides lps are among the constituents of the outer cell wall of heterotrophic gram negative bacteria and cyanobacteria sykora et al 1980 endotoxins are known to cause various symptoms in humans typically via intravenous exposure including fever diarrhea and vomiting hypotension shock intravascular coagulation and death can also occur at elevated endotoxin concentrations anderson et al 2002 2003 the lipid component of lps lipid a determines the endotoxin activity and contributes to the pathogenic potential of gram negative bacteria studies on the conformation and activity relationship of lipid a have indicated that its principal structural and conformational diversity in different bacterial species e g type and number of long chain fatty acids were closely associated with the endotoxin activity tanamoto 1989 rietschel et al 1993 endotoxin is also known to be very stable in the environment and hardly inactivated by heat e g dry heat sterilization the pharmaceutical industry has acknowledged endotoxins as potential pyrogens in parenteral drug products gerba and hou 1985 and focused a great of attention to prevent endotoxin contamination in their products e g intravenous drugs and injection solvents the occurrence of endotoxin or endotoxin activity in the water environments and their fates in water treatment processes and finished water have been attracted a great deal of attention from the research community since the 1970s in early studies luzio and friedmann 1973 investigated endotoxins in surface water groundwater tap water and various beverages in the u s and reported endotoxin levels of 1 400 μg ml in these samples haas et al 1983 conducted a long term study at two water treatment and distribution systems in the u s over an 18 month period and endotoxins were observed at levels between 3 and 14 μg l since the late 1980s endotoxin concentrations have mostly been reported in endotoxin activity units per volume e g eu ml rather than in weight units per volume e g ng ml reflecting the fact that endotoxin activity differs between bacterial species anderson et al 2002 pointed out that 1 ng ml was roughly equivalent to 5 10 eu ml by estimation from studies reporting a conversion factor burger et al 1989 compared two wastewater reclamation plants in namibia and south africa for their ability to remove endotoxins from raw wastewater endotoxin activities in the raw wastewater were very high i e up to 2528 and 1350 eu ml respectively endotoxin activity was effectively decreased in the course of the wastewater reclamation process particularly in the early treatment stages including chemical coagulation breakpoint chlorination and sand filtration they also observed significant increases in the levels of endotoxins by up to 50 after activated carbon column treatment rapala et al 2002 investigated endotoxin concentrations in water sources and drinking water purification plants dwpps at the time of 151 cyanobacterial water blooms in finland endotoxin levels in raw water of nine dwpps ranged from 18 to 356 eu ml and those in finished water ranged from 3 to 15 eu ml at their in depth studies during the course of water purification processes at two dwpps the highest reductions of endotoxin concentrations 83 86 were observed in the early stages including chemical coagulation sedimentation and sand filtration they also found that activated carbon filtration either increased or had no effect on endotoxin concentrations and chemical oxidation by ozonation and chlorination had little effect in recent studies endotoxin activity by free endotoxins dissolved in water hereafter described as free et and that by bound endotoxins associated with particles including cell walls of viable non viable gram negative bacteria bound et were separated by centrifugation and differences in their occurrence and fate were discussed ohkouchi et al 2007 reported that the effluent from wastewater treatment plants would be a major source of endotoxin contamination in yodo river basin in japan where the total endotoxin activities ranged from 311 to 2430 eu ml they also observed increases in bound et after activated carbon adsorption process associated with bacterial regrowth and that the ratio of free et to total endotoxin activity total et increased by chlorination and ozonation can et al 2013 determined endotoxin contamination at a dwpp in beijing and its source water from a long water diversion channel between shijiazhuang and beijing china the total endotoxin activities in the source water samples ranged from 21 to 41 eu ml and those in finished water of the dwpp ranged from 4 to 10 eu ml showing a 31 decrease in free et and 71 decrease in bound et by the entire water purification process they pointed out that the granular activated carbon filtration and chlorination induced bound et and free et increases respectively in these days the occurrence of endotoxins in water supplied to healthcare facilities hcfs by public and or their own private water supply systems has been a matter of great concern to medical professionals conducting dialysis therapies this is due to increasing awareness and also an increased need for strict control of microbial and endotoxin contamination in dialysis fluid as well as dialysis water i e solvent of dialysis fluid in the u s european countries and japan it has been reported that microbial contamination of dialysis fluid causes dialysis amyloidosis and malnutrition due to the strong physiological activities of endotoxins masakane et al 2013 and also a nationwide cohort study in japan concluded that higher facility endotoxin levels in dialysis fluid may be related to increased risk of all cause mortality among hemodialysis patients hasegawa et al 2015 moreover recent progress in an on line hemodiafiltration hdf technique requires ultrapure dialysis water and dialysis fluid served directly injecting the dialysis fluid into the patient s blood and removing accumulated metabolic products from blood by a combination of diffusive and convective transport through a semi permeable and high flux membrane tattersall and ward 2013 ase et al 2017 the japanese society for dialysis therapy jsdt has established the microbiological quality standard for dialysis fluid in 2008 along with these trends in dialysis therapy kawanishi et al 2009 recommended endotoxin level in dialysis water by the jsdt standard is much lower than that by the international organization for standardization iso standard revised in 2009 iso 2009 as shown in table 1 dialysis therapy at hcfs requires huge amounts of tap water as its raw water on site ultrapure water production systems mostly introduced in japanese hcfs are capable of producing 2 3 m3 of dialysis water per hour and typically consist of a prefilter an ion exchange filter activated carbon filters reverse osmosis ro modules an ro permeate storage tank a uv disinfection device and uf modules also known as endotoxin removal filters etrf ase et al 2017 appropriate routine operation and maintenance of the on site system including water quality monitoring of the entire process are crucial for safety management of dialysis therapy and has been recommended by the jsdt standard kawanishi et al 2009 actually the level of endotoxin level in dialysis water has been getting better at hcfs in japan jsdt 2017 however these efforts were solely made by medical professionals at their workplaces and they are not able to control endotoxin before their on site ultrapure water production systems i e tap water and its source from the viewpoint of water safety plan methodology to control chemical microbial risks at all steps in water supply from catchment to consumer or dialysis patients in this case tap water at hcfs water purification process at dwpps and source water should be also included in the critical control points for ensuring the safety of the dialysis water in the present study the occurrence and fate of both free et and bound et at selected japanese dwpps and hcfs were investigated to identify the key critical control points for the management of endotoxin in water for medical activities 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection seven dwpps across japan were selected for collection of water samples considering their source water water purification process treatment capacity and location table 2 four dwpps dwpp a1 b2 c and d take their source water from the downstream areas of rivers flowing into watersheds that include commercial industrial and residential areas dwpp b1 takes its source water from a water reservoir where water quality is seriously affected by the sporadic occurrence of algal blooms dwpp a2 withdraws groundwater from a nearby deep aquifer at 200 250 m below the ground surface and minimally affected by external contamination on the other hand dwpp e withdraws groundwater from a shallow aquifer at 10 15 m below the ground surface and is affected by penetration of nearby river water where trace levels of residual pharmaceuticals and their metabolites have been detected simazaki et al 2015 dwpp b1 c and d employ single or dual ozonation followed by biological activated carbon filtration for removal of trihalomethane precursors and trace chemicals of concern including taste and odor substances table 2 dwpp a1 and b2 employ conventional chemical coagulation sedimentation and rapid sand filtration powdered activated carbon is injected at both water intake points on an almost daily basis to remove taste and odor substances from the raw water the other two dwpps withdrawing groundwater employ chemical coagulation followed by direct rapid sand filtration dwpp e or chlorine disinfection only dwpp a2 all seven dwpps use a liquid chlorine agent i e sodium hypochlorite solution for final disinfection as well as intermittent oxidation with regard to chemical coagulation all seven dwpps use polyaluminum chloride pac solution nominal maximum treatment capacities of these dwpps are in the range of 35 000 to 1 700 000 m3 day the sum of treatment capacities of the seven dwpps accounts for approximately 12 of the gross national water treatment capacity in japan i e 15 154 mm3 year japan water works association 2016 three hcfs were selected from several national core hospitals taking into account water supply areas of the seven dwpps capacity of water tanks and presence absence of private groundwater supply systems table 3 hcf p receives water solely from its municipal water utilities i e dwpp a1 and a2 hcf q and hcf r utilize water from both municipal water services and private groundwater supply systems table 3 hcf q employs an on site groundwater purification process including rapid sand filtration microfiltration and chlorination meanwhile hcf r employs complex purification processes including water softening ozonation ultraviolet irradiation biological granular activated carbon filtration microfiltration and chlorination due to severe deterioration of groundwater quality e g elevated levels of disinfection byproduct precursors ammonia nitrogen and color the percentages of water quantity provided by municipal water utilities to the total water quantities were 100 10 and 40 for hcf p hcf q and hcf r respectively water samples were collected at these dwpps and hcfs in spring summer and autumn seasons between 2014 and 2016 taking into account possible increases in heterotrophic bacteria and also cyanobacteria as well as endotoxin activity in the source water process water and finished water in accordance with the rise of water temperature one liter amber glass bottles were pre washed with ultrapure water and autoclaved at 121 c for 20 min and then filled with each sample without air bubbles residual chlorine and ozone in water samples was immediately quenched with sodium hypochlorite in the bottles sample bottles were stored and transported in chilled containers and then used for analysis of the endotoxin activity and heterotrophic plate counts within 24 h of arrival at the authors laboratory 2 2 analytical methods 2 2 1 endotoxin activity the endotoxin activities in the water samples were determined by kinetic turbidimetric assay which is a commonly used variant of the limulus amebocyte lysate lal test for quantifying endotoxins from gram negative bacteria and cyanobacteria who 2016 briefly the lysate of amebocytes obtained from the horseshoe crab limulus polyphemus contains factors and enzymes that will form a gel in the presence of trace endotoxins as a consequence the turbidity in water samples will increase in a dose and time dependent manner the kinetic turbidimetric assay quantifies the endotoxin activity based on the gel formation time to reach a designated turbidity or a designated visible light absorption in water samples by spectrophotometry jorgensen et al 1973 reported that the lal test could determine both free endotoxin dissolved in water and bound endotoxin associated with the cell walls of viable non viable gram negative bacteria thus prior to analysis of the endotoxin activity portions of water samples were centrifuged at 14 000 rpm for 10 min using a cooled centrifuge model 3700 kubota corporation with reference to ohkouchi et al 2007 and the supernatants were then used for determination of endotoxin activity derived from the free endotoxin on the other hand water samples without centrifugation were used for determination of the endotoxin activity from total endotoxin i e the sum of free and bound endotoxin the bound endotoxin bound et was calculated by subtracting free endotoxin free et from total endotoxin total et all analytical instruments for the kinetic turbidimetric assay toxinometer mini control and analysis software toximaster mini and lal reagent lal mini for dialysis were purchased from wako pure chemical industries procedures for sample preparation and analytical conditions were determined in accordance with the manufacturer s instructions briefly the centrifuged non centrifuged samples were diluted 100 to 10 000 fold within the appropriate analytical range 0 001 0 25 eu ml using ultrapure water merck millipore sterile microtubes and micropipette tips guaranteed to be free of endotoxins and pyrogens aliquots of 300 μl of the diluted samples were gently poured into microtubes with lal reagent to avoid making air bubbles stirred slightly to dissolve the reagent and then set in the analytical instrument for continuous monitoring of gel formation i e increase of absorbance at 660 nm at 37 c the control and analysis software automatically calculated the endotoxin activity based on a standard curve for the lal reagent provided by the manufacturer dependent on its production lot 2 2 2 heterotrophic plate counts the number of heterotrophic bacteria in the water samples has been used as an indicator of viable bacteria that would act as contaminating endotoxin source in the water recommended total viable microbial counts level in dialysis water by the jsdt standard is less than 100 cfu ml table 1 and analytical method for total viable microbial counts kawanishi et al 2009 is nearly identical to that for heterotrophic plate counts japan water works association 2011 water samples were diluted with sterile phosphate buffer solution plated to three petri dishes per sample using r2a medium difco r2a agar bd and then cultivated for 7 days at 20 c plates showing 30 300 colonies per plate were chosen and counted 2 3 statistical tests the statistical significance of free et and bound et decrease ratios by each water purification process over the dwpps was tested by welch s t test or unequal variances t test using r version 3 4 3 r core team 2017 the significance level was set to 5 3 results 3

samples are presented in the supplementary information table s1 total et of the samples in river water and reservoir water taken at dwpp a1 b1 b2 c and d were within the range of 56 9 236 7 eu ml fig 1 a c d e and f seasonal variations in total et were significant at these five dwpps average total et of the source water samples at dwpp a1 b1 b2 c and d were 113 6 80 9 168 1 70 4 164 0 92 8 100 8

the other hand total et of the samples in groundwater collected at dwpp a2 and e was reduced 0 02 0 36 eu ml and more stable than in river and reservoir water samples fig 1 b and g the average ratio of free et to total et for groundwater samples was 0 44 0 74 and comparable to surface water samples endotoxin activities in the river and reservoir source water were significantly decreased during the course of conventional water purification processes i e chemical coagulation followed by sedimentation and rapid sand filtration fig 1 a c d e and f total et after sedimentation at the five dwpps was within the range of 3 22 89 1 eu ml and then significantly decreased by subsequent rapid sand filtration down to 1 34 30 5 eu ml at dwpp a1 b2 and d a slight increase in total et up to 0 2 eu ml was observed at dwpp e after chemical coagulation followed by direct rapid sand filtration ozonation also contributed to decreases of endotoxin activities at dwpp b1 c and d fig 1 c e and f total et of water samples after mid post ozonation was 4 43 14 3 eu ml on the other hand biological carbon filtration significantly increased endotoxin activity at all of the dwpps employing this process fig 1 c e and f total et after the biological activated carbon filtration process was within the range of 11 8 48 6 eu ml the average ratio of free et to total et after primary rapid sand filtration mid post ozonation and biological activated carbon filtration were 0 53 0 77 0 57 0 77 and 0 62 0 84 respectively endotoxin activities in the finished water samples varied according to their source waters and water purification processes total et in the finished water at dwpp a1 and b2 employing conventional water purification processes for river source water contained 4 06 1 69 and 3 40 2 28 eu ml

water at dwpp e withdrawing groundwater and treated by chemical coagulation direct rapid sand filtration and chlorine disinfection was 0 15 0 06 eu ml total et at dwpp a2 was comparable to that at dwpp a1 4 90 1 32 eu ml after mixing half and half with dwpp a1 finished water 3 2 endotoxin activity at healthcare facilities endotoxin activities in the water samples collected at the three hcfs are shown in fig 2 individual data on the endotoxin activity in water samples are presented in the supplementary information table s2 endotoxin activities in the municipal water supplied to each healthcare facility were mostly stable during the course of water distribution networks total et in the water tanks at hcf p and r fig 2 a and c both of which exclusively store municipal water were 4 62 1 15 and 21 9 5 41 eu ml respectively and comparable to the total et in the finished water at dwpp a2 and c 4 90 1 32 and 16 1 6 33 eu ml respectively endotoxin activities in the private groundwater supply systems implemented at hcf q and r showed different consequences according to their raw water qualities and also configuration of water purification processes table 2 total et in the raw groundwater samples at hcf q was 0 50 0 09 eu ml and that in the finished water samples slightly decreased to 0 21 0 03 eu ml after on site rapid sand filtration microfiltration and chlorination total et in the water tank jumped to 1 34 1 01 eu ml after blending with municipal water from dwpp b1 and b2 fig 2 b on the other hand total et in the raw groundwater samples at hcf r was 3 23 2 33 eu ml and that in the finished water samples increased markedly up to 19 5 11 4 eu ml comparable to the level in municipal water supplied by dwpp d 21 9 5 41 eu ml after blending with municipal water and storage in the water tank for few days total et increased again up to 32 4 12 6 eu ml fig 2 c total et in the tap water samples increased slightly in the water service pipes on the premises of hcf p 6 09 2 19 eu ml fig 2 a together with an increase in heterotrophic plate counts as described in the following section total et at hcf q and r decreased slightly from the water tank 0 96 0 91 and 29 5 11 0 eu ml respectively fig 2 b and c 3 3 heterotrophic plate counts at water purification plants and healthcare facilities heterotrophic plate counts hpc in the water samples collected at the seven dwpps and the three hcfs are shown in fig 3 individual data on hpc in water samples are presented in the supplementary information table s3 and s4 hpc in river water and reservoir water taken at dwpp a1 b1 b2 c and d were within the range of 2 9 1 1 105 8 7 4 0 105 cfu ml fig 3 a c d e and f those in groundwater samples at dwpp a2 and e were far lower than the surface water samples 1 2 0 6 103 and 4 9 2 7 101 cfu ml respectively fig 3 b and g hpc in the surface water samples were significantly removed and or inactivated during the course of water purification hpc after conventional water purification process including chemical coagulation sedimentation and rapid sand filtration were much smaller than the source water samples by 1 5 orders of magnitude chemical oxidation processes i e chlorination and ozonation were both effective for inactivation of hpc on the other hand increases in hpc were observed after biological activated carbon filtration at dwpp c and d hpc in the finished water were in the range of 3 3 1 9 10 1 and 2 0 1 1 101 cfu ml respectively fig 3 e and f hpc in groundwater samples obtained on the premises of hcf q and r were 9 3 4 6 101 and 2 6 1 2 103 cfu ml respectively variations of hpc level were observed in the water tanks of each hcf hcf p q and r contained 1 0 0 5 101 5 8 2 1 101 and 4 2 1 6 102 cfu ml respectively increases in hpc in the water service pipes were observed at all hcfs hpc in tap water collected from faucets at hcf p q and r were 8 7 4 4 101 7 5 3 9 102 and 5 1 1 9 102 cfu ml respectively fig 3 h and i and j 4 discussion 4 1 occurrence and fate of the endotoxin activity in source water previous studies have indicated that the origins of endotoxins in the water environment were a a variety of gram negative bacteria and or cyanobacteria contained in artificial natural wastewater discharges including effluent from wastewater treatment plants e g ohkouchi et al 2007 can et al 2013 and b cyanobacteria in water reservoirs and lakes in watersheds e g rapala et al 2002 in the present study the source water samples obtained from the four dwpps dwpp a1 b2 c and d were mostly affected by effluents from several wastewater treatment plants located upstream of their source rivers the effluent from wastewater treatment plants as well as the occurrence of cyanobacteria would have significant impacts on the elevated endotoxin activities in these surface water samples ohkouchi et al 2007 investigated endotoxin activities in the effluent from a wastewater treatment plant 10 800 eu ml and pointed out that the level of endotoxin activity in river water would markedly increase downstream of the effluents from wastewater treatment plants the sample from dwpp b1 was also affected by the sporadic occurrence of algal blooms the highest total et 236 7 eu ml was observed at dwpp b1 and was probably due to the sporadic occurrence of cyanobacteria e g microcystis spp and anabaena spp in reservoir b average ratios of free et to total et for river and reservoir water samples were within the range of 0 49 0 67 and were comparable to a previous study in china approximately 0 54 0 67 can et al 2013 fluctuations of total et observed in these surface water samples fig 1 were probably due to various external conditions including seasonal variations in river water flow discharge rates of effluent from wastewater treatment plants and occurrence of cyanobacteria in the reservoir on the other hand total et levels in groundwater samples were much lower than those in the surface water samples probably due to the absence of wastewater contamination in the groundwater interestingly raw water of dwpp e withdrawn from the shallow aquifer affected by penetration of nearby river water had much lower total et 0 03 0 01 eu ml than that of dwpp a2 withdrawn from the deep aquifer 0 27 0 08 eu ml this was in accordance with the occurrence of hpc in the samples hpc in the raw water of dwpp e was 1 8 2 7 101 cfu ml and was much lower than that of dwpp a2 4 2 6 6 102 cfu ml the nearby river water contains the effluent of several upstream wastewater treatment plants and thus total et and hpc were significantly higher than other river water samples 476 7 168 5 eu ml and 1 3 0 9 106 cfu ml respectively most of heterotrophic bacteria as well as endotoxins could be removed during the course of penetration via the riverbed total et in the groundwater samples withdrawn at healthcare facilities were slightly higher at hcf q 0 50 0 09 eu ml or much higher at hcf r 3 23 2 33 eu ml than at dwpp a2 and e hpc levels in hcf r samples were also notably higher 1 5 1 2 103 cfu ml than that in other groundwater samples reflecting the severe deterioration of groundwater quality around hcf r 4 2 occurrence and fate of the endotoxin activity in the water purification process mixed effects on the decrease in the endotoxin activity were observed in the course of the water purification process at the seven dwpps fig 4 summarizes the decrease ratios of free et and bound et for each purification process or a series of purification processes compared with those in water samples just prior to each process negative values indicate that the water purification process caused an increase in the endotoxin activity 4 2 1 chemical coagulation and sedimentation average decrease ratios of free et and bound et by chemical coagulation using polyaluminum followed by gravity sedimentation were 86 5 8 5 and 60 8 37 5 respectively fig 4 a there results were better than or comparable to can s study at a single dwpp in beijing in which up to 52 of free et and up to 72 of bound et were removed by the combination of coagulation and sedimentation processes can et al 2013 free et was mostly decreased by this process and its decrease ratios were stable rietschel et al 1993 reported that the primary structure of lipid a derived from various bacteria elucidated by previous studies contains a hydroxyl group and other hydrophilic groups free endotoxins and polyaluminum chloride can be held together by an ionic bond and sedimented on the other hand variation of bound et decrease ratios was observed in this study bound et after coagulation sedimentation would be from gram negative bacteria and cyanobacteria not aggregated into coagulation flocs and or not settled in sedimentation tanks thus the variation would probably be due to different conditions for floc formation i e coagulant dose raw water quality e g ph water temperature and turbidity and also the strength of subsequent mixing this was also supported by the wide variety of hpc decrease ratios by this process calculated by dividing hpc after coagulation sedimentation by hpc in river water within the range of 5 8 4 3 10 5 to 1 0 1 6 100 as a consequence ratios of free et to total et were significantly decreased by chemical coagulation and sedimentation fig 1 a c d e and f 4 2 2 rapid sand filtration in contrast to chemical coagulation and sedimentation physical removal of bound et by rapid sand filtration rsf was much more effective than that of free et 69 0 19 4 and 9 8 23 8 respectively fig 4 a during this process bound et associated with particles including dead alive gram negative bacteria and cyanobacteria cells would be efficiently sieved by the sand filter on the other hand most of the free et dissolved in water would pass through the sand filter because its molecular size is estimated approximately 10 20 kda petsch and anspach 2000 and it would be hardly removed it is notable that ozonation prior to rapid sand filtration conducted at dwpp b1 and c could cause statistically significant increases in free et in the filtrate fig 4 a p 0 004 anderson et al 2008 observed an increase of total endotoxin in filtrates of their bench scale dual anthracite sand filtration enriched with nutrients and stimulated biofilm formation ozonation is also well known to increase microbial growth potential by decomposing persistent organic compounds into assimilable organic carbons and thus biofilm formation in sand filtration similar to that in biological activated carbon filtration would be likely to occur however backwashing of the rapid sand filter using finished i e chlorinated water typically conducted every 48 72 h in japanese dwpps should strongly affect biofilm formation in the sand filtration layer and the increase of endotoxin activity there 4 2 3 chemical oxidation chlorination and ozonation most recent studies at dwpps and wastewater treatment plants wwtps showed that decreases of endotoxin activity by chemical oxidation processes i e chlorination and ozonation were limited at a single dwpp in finland rapala et al 2002 reported decrease ratios of total et by chlorination and ozonation of 8 6 and 8 3 respectively can et al 2013 reported that total et in finished water increased slightly after final chlorine disinfection with significant release of free et and a decrease in bound et and concluded that chlorination induced free et release huang et al 2011 observed that chlorination could not effectively decrease endotoxin activity of secondary effluent of a wwtp and that chlorination of pure cultured e coli and a gram negative bacteria isolated from secondary sewage effluent resulted in a significant increase under 10 mg l initial chlorine dose for 30 min they also reported that both free et and bound et significantly increased after chlorination of pure cultured e coli under conditions of high initial dose 50 mg l 30 min in the present study decreases in endotoxin activity by these chemical oxidation processes were moderate and more effective against bound et than free et fig 4 b average decrease ratios of free et and bound et by primary chlorination at dwpp b1 and b2 were 14 0 30 5 and 27 9 18 5 and those by post chlorination i e final chlorine disinfection in most cases at all dwpps were 1 6 21 2 and 9 1 53 8 respectively this tendency was more significant for ozonation average decrease ratios of free et and bound et by mid ozonation at dwpp b1 and c were 17 7 23 2 and 63 9 10 7 and that by post ozonation at dwpp b1 c and d were 11 1 13 6 and 46 4 29 7 respectively moreover better efficiencies of endotoxin activity decrease at the early mid stage of chemical oxidation i e primary chlorination and mid ozonation were observed in accordance with higher injection ratios of chlorine and ozone conduced at each dwpp on the sampling dates table 4 according to these findings in the previous and present studies chemical oxidation processes would affect both decreases and increases in endotoxin activity via the following reactions 1 bound et increase by cell lysis 2 transformation of bound et to free et resulting in bound et decrease and free et increase and 3 free et decrease by decomposing primary structure of lipid a in the above reactions the reaction rate of lipid a decomposition might not be significant in the actual water purification processes this was supported by the fact that ratios of free et to total et significantly increased in ozonated water samples and finished water samples fig 1 anderson et al 2003 conducted laboratory scale inactivation experiments using a commercially available endotoxin derived from e coli o55 b5 i e free endotoxin by free chlorine monochloramine and potassium permanganate and reported inactivation rates of 1 4 1 0 and 0 7 eu ml h respectively judging from hydraulic retention times for post chlorination or final chlorine disinfection at the target dwpps approximately 3 6 h on average the contribution of free et decomposition by chlorination would be small more studies on the fate of endotoxin activity by chemical oxidation are necessary because the rates of these three reactions have not been elucidated in particular increase and decrease rates by ozonation 4 2 4 biological activated carbon filtration significant increases in endotoxin activity were observed at all dwpps employing the biological activated carbon bac filtration process i e dwpp b2 c and d and were mostly in agreement with previous studies burger et al 1989 rapala et al 2002 ohkouchi et al 2007 can et al 2013 in the present study the increase ratios of free et and bound et after bac filtration were 100 7 79 1 and 89 7 126 2 respectively heterotrophic plate counts were multiplied remarkably after this process except for dwpp b1 fig 2 so the increase in endotoxin activity was probably due to the release of alive dead gram negative bacteria inhabiting the activated carbon filter into the filtrate it is notable that both free et and bound et were increased at all dwpps in japan in this study and in that reported by ohkouchi et al 2007 on the other hand the change in free et was not significant at the dwpp in beijing can et al 2013 this difference in fate of free et by biological activated carbon filtration was probably due to the inclusion of ozonation just prior to bac filtration at japanese dwpps due to residual ozone in the influent of the bac filter some gram negative bacteria inside the activated carbon would be oxidized lysed and contribute to the increases in both bound et and free et as discussed in the previous section in addition post rapid sand filtration rsf solely implemented at dwpp d was quite effective to decrease free et and bound et again after bac filtration fig 4 c compares the decrease ratios of free et and bound et by ozonation plus bac dwpp b1 c and d and by ozonation bac plus post rsf dwpp d improvement in the decrease ratio of endotoxin activity was statistically significant for free et p 0 0004 but not statistically significant for bound et p 0 351 it should be noted that free et was efficiently decreased by post rsf without any additional chemical coagulant further investigation of the free et decrease here would be of interest in terms of mitigation of the elevated endotoxin activity by bac filtration 4 3 occurrence and fate of the endotoxin activity at the healthcare facilities 4 3 1 on site groundwater purification process at hcfs the on site groundwater purification process employed at hcf q consisting of rsf microfiltration and chlorination decreased most bound et and some free et in groundwater average bound et in raw water and on site treated water were 0 14 0 04 and 0 03 0 01eu ml and average free et in raw water and on site treated water were 0 32 0 08 and 0 19 0 03eu ml respectively rsf was implemented for removal of residual manganese and iron in groundwater and chemical coagulant was not applied here so removal of free bound et might be limited post microfiltration could be more significant for physical removal of most bound et some part of free et might also be removed by microfiltration despite its nominal pore size 0 05 10 μm larger than free et on the other hand another on site groundwater purification process employed at hcf r consisting of rapid sand filtration ozonation ultraviolet irradiation biological activated carbon filtration microfiltration and chlorination drastically increased both free et and bound et average bound et in raw water and on site treated water were 2 14 2 33 and 4 14 3 95eu ml and average free et in raw water and on site treated water were 1 09 0 58 and 15 3 8 27eu ml respectively it should be noted that hpc in raw groundwater of hcf r was much higher than those of other facilities by 1 3 orders of magnitude hcf r 2 0 102 2 6 103 cfu ml hcf q 1 1 9 3 101 cfu ml dwpp e 1 7 100 4 9 101 cfu ml thus possible high concentration of gram negative bacteria in source water along with chemical oxidation and biological activated carbon filtration processes could cause elevated level of endotoxin activity in finished water further investigations on this kind of on site groundwater purification system are necessary to identify key water purification processes and their operation maintenance conditions for mitigating endotoxin activity in water for healthcare facilities 4 3 2 water tanks and faucets at hcfs hpc increased during the course of transit from the water tank to faucets at all of the hcfs fig 2 but interestingly endotoxin activity did not always increase in the same manner increases in bound et and decreases in ratio of free et to total et were concurrently observed at hcf p and q it is possible that microbial regrowth in water service pipes would cause the increase in endotoxin activity on the other hand both free et and bound et decreased and ratio of free et to total et increased at hcf r possible explanations for this difference in fate of endotoxin and heterotrophic bacteria are much longer hydraulic retention time a few days and higher residual free chlorine level approximately 2 0 mg l in the water tank at hcf r as disaster countermeasures against huge earthquakes and catastrophic floods mostly accompanied by water outages this would possibly facilitate the degradation of both free and bound et during the course of transit from water tank to faucets considering the rates of both bound et and free et decomposition by chlorination as discussed before and could also cause a difference in microbial community in the water service pipes so the occurrence of gram negative bacteria might not be significant it will be of interest to conduct in depth studies on the differences in microbial communities contributing to the occurrence and fate of endotoxin activity in water supply systems including water source purification process e g biological activated carbon filtration water distribution network and faucets another issue is that hpc is not able to cover majority of the viable bacteria in water samples and limited information has been still available on the occurrence and fate of viable bacteria contributing to the endotoxin activity development of more appropriate indicators and methodologies that cover the majority of gram negative bacteria releasing endotoxin into water e g fluorescence staining and flow cytometry would be helpful in the future studies 4 4 implications of residual endotoxin activity in water for dialysis therapy the occurrence and fate of endotoxin activity in water supplied to healthcare facilities as the raw water for dialysis therapy have been attracting a great deal of attention from medical practitioners and medical engineers to ensure microbial quality in the dialysis water by on site ultrapure water production systems elevated endotoxin activity in the raw water typically along with elevated microbial contamination is a matter of great concern in the management of on site ultrapure water production by increasing the burden to ro and uf membrane modules and possibly deteriorating microbial water quality in dialysis water for the preparation of dialysis fluid kawanishi et al 2009 in this regard it is desirable for healthcare facilities conducting dialysis therapy to obtain water with as low as possible endotoxin activity as elucidated in this study the occurrence and fate of endotoxin activity in water are strongly dependent on the water sources and configuration of the water purification processes in both municipal and private water supply systems bacterial regrowth in water tanks and water service pipes on the premises would also contribute to the increase in endotoxin activity along with heterotrophic bacteria little information regarding these issues is available for medical professionals in hcfs moreover the needs for high quality water for medical practices i e lowering the endotoxin activity and viable microbes in water for dialysis therapy are poorly acknowledged by professionals in water supply engineering including researchers academics and managers engineers of water utilities collaborations between these professionals would be worthwhile for mitigating endotoxin activity e g sharing microbial water quality monitoring data occurrence of hazardous events in water sources e g cyanobacterial blooms in water reservoirs and strengthening water purification processes to further decrease the remaining endotoxin activity in water for dialysis therapy 5 conclusions the present study elucidated the occurrence and fate of endotoxin activity from source water of dwpps to tap water of hcfs in japan including various conventional advanced water purification processes endotoxin activities in river water and reservoir water were much higher than those in groundwater physical removal processes by chemical coagulation and sedimentation rapid sand filtration and membrane filtration were highly effective to decrease both free et and bound et moderate decreases in bound et and limited decreases in free et were observed by chemical oxidation processes i e chlorination and ozonation bacterial activated carbon filtration was a major cause of significant increase in endotoxin activity in the course of drinking water purification process however post rapid sand filtration mitigated the endotoxin activity again levels of residual endotoxin activity in water supplied to hcfs were strongly affected by their source waters and the configurations of water purification processes served microbial regrowth on the premises from water tanks to faucets could also contribute to increases in endotoxin activity at hcfs

19288,occurrence of residual endotoxin activity et in dialysis water and also tap water as its source is a matter of great concern to medical professionals conducting dialysis therapy at healthcare facilities hcfs the present study was performed to determine the occurrence and fate of the et at selected japanese drinking water purification plants and hcfs between 2014 and 2016 chemical coagulation and sedimentation rapid sand filtration and membrane filtration were highly effective to decrease both et dissolved in water free et and et bound to cells particles bound et moderate decreases in bound et and limited decreases in free et were observed by chlorination and ozonation bacterial activated carbon filtration was a major cause of significant increases in endotoxin activity during the course of drinking water purification process levels of residual et in water supplied to hcfs were strongly affected by their source waters and the configurations of water purification processes served microbial regrowth on the premises from water tanks to faucets at hcfs could also contribute to et increases in tap water graphical abstract image 1 keywords dialysis endotoxin healthcare facility water supply water purification 1 introduction endotoxins or lipopolysaccharides lps are among the constituents of the outer cell wall of heterotrophic gram negative bacteria and cyanobacteria sykora et al 1980 endotoxins are known to cause various symptoms in humans typically via intravenous exposure including fever diarrhea and vomiting hypotension shock intravascular coagulation and death can also occur at elevated endotoxin concentrations anderson et al 2002 2003 the lipid component of lps lipid a determines the endotoxin activity and contributes to the pathogenic potential of gram negative bacteria studies on the conformation and activity relationship of lipid a have indicated that its principal structural and conformational diversity in different bacterial species e g type and number of long chain fatty acids were closely associated with the endotoxin activity tanamoto 1989 rietschel et al 1993 endotoxin is also known to be very stable in the environment and hardly inactivated by heat e g dry heat sterilization the pharmaceutical industry has acknowledged endotoxins as potential pyrogens in parenteral drug products gerba and hou 1985 and focused a great of attention to prevent endotoxin contamination in their products e g intravenous drugs and injection solvents the occurrence of endotoxin or endotoxin activity in the water environments and their fates in water treatment processes and finished water have been attracted a great deal of attention from the research community since the 1970s in early studies luzio and friedmann 1973 investigated endotoxins in surface water groundwater tap water and various beverages in the u s and reported endotoxin levels of 1 400 μg ml in these samples haas et al 1983 conducted a long term study at two water treatment and distribution systems in the u s over an 18 month period and endotoxins were observed at levels between 3 and 14 μg l since the late 1980s endotoxin concentrations have mostly been reported in endotoxin activity units per volume e g eu ml rather than in weight units per volume e g ng ml reflecting the fact that endotoxin activity differs between bacterial species anderson et al 2002 pointed out that 1 ng ml was roughly equivalent to 5 10 eu ml by estimation from studies reporting a conversion factor burger et al 1989 compared two wastewater reclamation plants in namibia and south africa for their ability to remove endotoxins from raw wastewater endotoxin activities in the raw wastewater were very high i e up to 2528 and 1350 eu ml respectively endotoxin activity was effectively decreased in the course of the wastewater reclamation process particularly in the early treatment stages including chemical coagulation breakpoint chlorination and sand filtration they also observed significant increases in the levels of endotoxins by up to 50 after activated carbon column treatment rapala et al 2002 investigated endotoxin concentrations in water sources and drinking water purification plants dwpps at the time of 151 cyanobacterial water blooms in finland endotoxin levels in raw water of nine dwpps ranged from 18 to 356 eu ml and those in finished water ranged from 3 to 15 eu ml at their in depth studies during the course of water purification processes at two dwpps the highest reductions of endotoxin concentrations 83 86 were observed in the early stages including chemical coagulation sedimentation and sand filtration they also found that activated carbon filtration either increased or had no effect on endotoxin concentrations and chemical oxidation by ozonation and chlorination had little effect in recent studies endotoxin activity by free endotoxins dissolved in water hereafter described as free et and that by bound endotoxins associated with particles including cell walls of viable non viable gram negative bacteria bound et were separated by centrifugation and differences in their occurrence and fate were discussed ohkouchi et al 2007 reported that the effluent from wastewater treatment plants would be a major source of endotoxin contamination in yodo river basin in japan where the total endotoxin activities ranged from 311 to 2430 eu ml they also observed increases in bound et after activated carbon adsorption process associated with bacterial regrowth and that the ratio of free et to total endotoxin activity total et increased by chlorination and ozonation can et al 2013 determined endotoxin contamination at a dwpp in beijing and its source water from a long water diversion channel between shijiazhuang and beijing china the total endotoxin activities in the source water samples ranged from 21 to 41 eu ml and those in finished water of the dwpp ranged from 4 to 10 eu ml showing a 31 decrease in free et and 71 decrease in bound et by the entire water purification process they pointed out that the granular activated carbon filtration and chlorination induced bound et and free et increases respectively in these days the occurrence of endotoxins in water supplied to healthcare facilities hcfs by public and or their own private water supply systems has been a matter of great concern to medical professionals conducting dialysis therapies this is due to increasing awareness and also an increased need for strict control of microbial and endotoxin contamination in dialysis fluid as well as dialysis water i e solvent of dialysis fluid in the u s european countries and japan it has been reported that microbial contamination of dialysis fluid causes dialysis amyloidosis and malnutrition due to the strong physiological activities of endotoxins masakane et al 2013 and also a nationwide cohort study in japan concluded that higher facility endotoxin levels in dialysis fluid may be related to increased risk of all cause mortality among hemodialysis patients hasegawa et al 2015 moreover recent progress in an on line hemodiafiltration hdf technique requires ultrapure dialysis water and dialysis fluid served directly injecting the dialysis fluid into the patient s blood and removing accumulated metabolic products from blood by a combination of diffusive and convective transport through a semi permeable and high flux membrane tattersall and ward 2013 ase et al 2017 the japanese society for dialysis therapy jsdt has established the microbiological quality standard for dialysis fluid in 2008 along with these trends in dialysis therapy kawanishi et al 2009 recommended endotoxin level in dialysis water by the jsdt standard is much lower than that by the international organization for standardization iso standard revised in 2009 iso 2009 as shown in table 1 dialysis therapy at hcfs requires huge amounts of tap water as its raw water on site ultrapure water production systems mostly introduced in japanese hcfs are capable of producing 2 3 m3 of dialysis water per hour and typically consist of a prefilter an ion exchange filter activated carbon filters reverse osmosis ro modules an ro permeate storage tank a uv disinfection device and uf modules also known as endotoxin removal filters etrf ase et al 2017 appropriate routine operation and maintenance of the on site system including water quality monitoring of the entire process are crucial for safety management of dialysis therapy and has been recommended by the jsdt standard kawanishi et al 2009 actually the level of endotoxin level in dialysis water has been getting better at hcfs in japan jsdt 2017 however these efforts were solely made by medical professionals at their workplaces and they are not able to control endotoxin before their on site ultrapure water production systems i e tap water and its source from the viewpoint of water safety plan methodology to control chemical microbial risks at all steps in water supply from catchment to consumer or dialysis patients in this case tap water at hcfs water purification process at dwpps and source water should be also included in the critical control points for ensuring the safety of the dialysis water in the present study the occurrence and fate of both free et and bound et at selected japanese dwpps and hcfs were investigated to identify the key critical control points for the management of endotoxin in water for medical activities 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection seven dwpps across japan were selected for collection of water samples considering their source water water purification process treatment capacity and location table 2 four dwpps dwpp a1 b2 c and d take their source water from the downstream areas of rivers flowing into watersheds that include commercial industrial and residential areas dwpp b1 takes its source water from a water reservoir where water quality is seriously affected by the sporadic occurrence of algal blooms dwpp a2 withdraws groundwater from a nearby deep aquifer at 200 250 m below the ground surface and minimally affected by external contamination on the other hand dwpp e withdraws groundwater from a shallow aquifer at 10 15 m below the ground surface and is affected by penetration of nearby river water where trace levels of residual pharmaceuticals and their metabolites have been detected simazaki et al 2015 dwpp b1 c and d employ single or dual ozonation followed by biological activated carbon filtration for removal of trihalomethane precursors and trace chemicals of concern including taste and odor substances table 2 dwpp a1 and b2 employ conventional chemical coagulation sedimentation and rapid sand filtration powdered activated carbon is injected at both water intake points on an almost daily basis to remove taste and odor substances from the raw water the other two dwpps withdrawing groundwater employ chemical coagulation followed by direct rapid sand filtration dwpp e or chlorine disinfection only dwpp a2 all seven dwpps use a liquid chlorine agent i e sodium hypochlorite solution for final disinfection as well as intermittent oxidation with regard to chemical coagulation all seven dwpps use polyaluminum chloride pac solution nominal maximum treatment capacities of these dwpps are in the range of 35 000 to 1 700 000 m3 day the sum of treatment capacities of the seven dwpps accounts for approximately 12 of the gross national water treatment capacity in japan i e 15 154 mm3 year japan water works association 2016 three hcfs were selected from several national core hospitals taking into account water supply areas of the seven dwpps capacity of water tanks and presence absence of private groundwater supply systems table 3 hcf p receives water solely from its municipal water utilities i e dwpp a1 and a2 hcf q and hcf r utilize water from both municipal water services and private groundwater supply systems table 3 hcf q employs an on site groundwater purification process including rapid sand filtration microfiltration and chlorination meanwhile hcf r employs complex purification processes including water softening ozonation ultraviolet irradiation biological granular activated carbon filtration microfiltration and chlorination due to severe deterioration of groundwater quality e g elevated levels of disinfection byproduct precursors ammonia nitrogen and color the percentages of water quantity provided by municipal water utilities to the total water quantities were 100 10 and 40 for hcf p hcf q and hcf r respectively water samples were collected at these dwpps and hcfs in spring summer and autumn seasons between 2014 and 2016 taking into account possible increases in heterotrophic bacteria and also cyanobacteria as well as endotoxin activity in the source water process water and finished water in accordance with the rise of water temperature one liter amber glass bottles were pre washed with ultrapure water and autoclaved at 121 c for 20 min and then filled with each sample without air bubbles residual chlorine and ozone in water samples was immediately quenched with sodium hypochlorite in the bottles sample bottles were stored and transported in chilled containers and then used for analysis of the endotoxin activity and heterotrophic plate counts within 24 h of arrival at the authors laboratory 2 2 analytical methods 2 2 1 endotoxin activity the endotoxin activities in the water samples were determined by kinetic turbidimetric assay which is a commonly used variant of the limulus amebocyte lysate lal test for quantifying endotoxins from gram negative bacteria and cyanobacteria who 2016 briefly the lysate of amebocytes obtained from the horseshoe crab limulus polyphemus contains factors and enzymes that will form a gel in the presence of trace endotoxins as a consequence the turbidity in water samples will increase in a dose and time dependent manner the kinetic turbidimetric assay quantifies the endotoxin activity based on the gel formation time to reach a designated turbidity or a designated visible light absorption in water samples by spectrophotometry jorgensen et al 1973 reported that the lal test could determine both free endotoxin dissolved in water and bound endotoxin associated with the cell walls of viable non viable gram negative bacteria thus prior to analysis of the endotoxin activity portions of water samples were centrifuged at 14 000 rpm for 10 min using a cooled centrifuge model 3700 kubota corporation with reference to ohkouchi et al 2007 and the supernatants were then used for determination of endotoxin activity derived from the free endotoxin on the other hand water samples without centrifugation were used for determination of the endotoxin activity from total endotoxin i e the sum of free and bound endotoxin the bound endotoxin bound et was calculated by subtracting free endotoxin free et from total endotoxin total et all analytical instruments for the kinetic turbidimetric assay toxinometer mini control and analysis software toximaster mini and lal reagent lal mini for dialysis were purchased from wako pure chemical industries procedures for sample preparation and analytical conditions were determined in accordance with the manufacturer s instructions briefly the centrifuged non centrifuged samples were diluted 100 to 10 000 fold within the appropriate analytical range 0 001 0 25 eu ml using ultrapure water merck millipore sterile microtubes and micropipette tips guaranteed to be free of endotoxins and pyrogens aliquots of 300 μl of the diluted samples were gently poured into microtubes with lal reagent to avoid making air bubbles stirred slightly to dissolve the reagent and then set in the analytical instrument for continuous monitoring of gel formation i e increase of absorbance at 660 nm at 37 c the control and analysis software automatically calculated the endotoxin activity based on a standard curve for the lal reagent provided by the manufacturer dependent on its production lot 2 2 2 heterotrophic plate counts the number of heterotrophic bacteria in the water samples has been used as an indicator of viable bacteria that would act as contaminating endotoxin source in the water recommended total viable microbial counts level in dialysis water by the jsdt standard is less than 100 cfu ml table 1 and analytical method for total viable microbial counts kawanishi et al 2009 is nearly identical to that for heterotrophic plate counts japan water works association 2011 water samples were diluted with sterile phosphate buffer solution plated to three petri dishes per sample using r2a medium difco r2a agar bd and then cultivated for 7 days at 20 c plates showing 30 300 colonies per plate were chosen and counted 2 3 statistical tests the statistical significance of free et and bound et decrease ratios by each water purification process over the dwpps was tested by welch s t test or unequal variances t test using r version 3 4 3 r core team 2017 the significance level was set to 5 3 results 3 1 endotoxin activity in drinking water purification plants endotoxin activities in the water samples collected at the seven dwpps are shown in fig 1 individual data on the endotoxin activity in water samples are presented in the supplementary information table s1 total et of the samples in river water and reservoir water taken at dwpp a1 b1 b2 c and d were within the range of 56 9 236 7 eu ml fig 1 a c d e and f seasonal variations in total et were significant at these five dwpps average total et of the source water samples at dwpp a1 b1 b2 c and d were 113 6 80 9 168 1 70 4 164 0 92 8 100 8 39 8 and 115 6 71 6 eu ml respectively of these approximately half of the endotoxin activity was free et the average ratio of free et to total et was 0 49 0 67 for river and reservoir water samples on the other hand total et of the samples in groundwater collected at dwpp a2 and e was reduced 0 02 0 36 eu ml and more stable than in river and reservoir water samples fig 1 b and g the average ratio of free et to total et for groundwater samples was 0 44 0 74 and comparable to surface water samples endotoxin activities in the river and reservoir source water were significantly decreased during the course of conventional water purification processes i e chemical coagulation followed by sedimentation and rapid sand filtration fig 1 a c d e and f total et after sedimentation at the five dwpps was within the range of 3 22 89 1 eu ml and then significantly decreased by subsequent rapid sand filtration down to 1 34 30 5 eu ml at dwpp a1 b2 and d a slight increase in total et up to 0 2 eu ml was observed at dwpp e after chemical coagulation followed by direct rapid sand filtration ozonation also contributed to decreases of endotoxin activities at dwpp b1 c and d fig 1 c e and f total et of water samples after mid post ozonation was 4 43 14 3 eu ml on the other hand biological carbon filtration significantly increased endotoxin activity at all of the dwpps employing this process fig 1 c e and f total et after the biological activated carbon filtration process was within the range of 11 8 48 6 eu ml the average ratio of free et to total et after primary rapid sand filtration mid post ozonation and biological activated carbon filtration were 0 53 0 77 0 57 0 77 and 0 62 0 84 respectively endotoxin activities in the finished water samples varied according to their source waters and water purification processes total et in the finished water at dwpp a1 and b2 employing conventional water purification processes for river source water contained 4 06 1 69 and 3 40 2 28 eu ml respectively total et at dwpp b1 c and d employing advanced water purification process for river reservoir source water were 24 6 9 72 16 1 6 33 and 8 55 9 52 eu ml respectively total et in finished water at dwpp e withdrawing groundwater and treated by chemical coagulation direct rapid sand filtration and chlorine disinfection was 0 15 0 06 eu ml total et at dwpp a2 was comparable to that at dwpp a1 4 90 1 32 eu ml after mixing half and half with dwpp a1 finished water 3 2 endotoxin activity at healthcare facilities endotoxin activities in the water samples collected at the three hcfs are shown in fig 2 individual data on the endotoxin activity in water samples are presented in the supplementary information table s2 endotoxin activities in the municipal water supplied to each healthcare facility were mostly stable during the course of water distribution networks total et in the water tanks at hcf p and r fig 2 a and c both of which exclusively store municipal water were 4 62 1 15 and 21 9 5 41 eu ml respectively and comparable to the total et in the finished water at dwpp a2 and c 4 90 1 32 and 16 1 6 33 eu ml respectively endotoxin activities in the private groundwater supply systems implemented at hcf q and r showed different consequences according to their raw water qualities and also configuration of water purification processes table 2 total et in the raw groundwater samples at hcf q was 0 50 0 09 eu ml and that in the finished water samples slightly decreased to 0 21 0 03 eu ml after on site rapid sand filtration microfiltration and chlorination total et in the water tank jumped to 1 34 1 01 eu ml after blending with municipal water from dwpp b1 and b2 fig 2 b on the other hand total et in the raw groundwater samples at hcf r was 3 23 2 33 eu ml and that in the finished water samples increased markedly up to 19 5 11 4 eu ml comparable to the level in municipal water supplied by dwpp d 21 9 5 41 eu ml after blending with municipal water and storage in the water tank for few days total et increased again up to 32 4 12 6 eu ml fig 2 c total et in the tap water samples increased slightly in the water service pipes on the premises of hcf p 6 09 2 19 eu ml fig 2 a together with an increase in heterotrophic plate counts as described in the following section total et at hcf q and r decreased slightly from the water tank 0 96 0 91 and 29 5 11 0 eu ml respectively fig 2 b and c 3 3 heterotrophic plate counts at water purification plants and healthcare facilities heterotrophic plate counts hpc in the water samples collected at the seven dwpps and the three hcfs are shown in fig 3 individual data on hpc in water samples are presented in the supplementary information table s3 and s4 hpc in river water and reservoir water taken at dwpp a1 b1 b2 c and d were within the range of 2 9 1 1 105 8 7 4 0 105 cfu ml fig 3 a c d e and f those in groundwater samples at dwpp a2 and e were far lower than the surface water samples 1 2 0 6 103 and 4 9 2 7 101 cfu ml respectively fig 3 b and g hpc in the surface water samples were significantly removed and or inactivated during the course of water purification hpc after conventional water purification process including chemical coagulation sedimentation and rapid sand filtration were much smaller than the source water samples by 1 5 orders of magnitude chemical oxidation processes i e chlorination and ozonation were both effective for inactivation of hpc on the other hand increases in hpc were observed after biological activated carbon filtration at dwpp c and d hpc in the finished water were in the range of 3 3 1 9 10 1 and 2 0 1 1 101 cfu ml respectively fig 3 e and f hpc in groundwater samples obtained on the premises of hcf q and r were 9 3 4 6 101 and 2 6 1 2 103 cfu ml respectively variations of hpc level were observed in the water tanks of each hcf hcf p q and r contained 1 0 0 5 101 5 8 2 1 101 and 4 2 1 6 102 cfu ml respectively increases in hpc in the water service pipes were observed at all hcfs hpc in tap water collected from faucets at hcf p q and r were 8 7 4 4 101 7 5 3 9 102 and 5 1 1 9 102 cfu ml respectively fig 3 h and i and j 4 discussion 4 1 occurrence and fate of the endotoxin activity in source water previous studies have indicated that the origins of endotoxins in the water environment were a a variety of gram negative bacteria and or cyanobacteria contained in artificial natural wastewater discharges including effluent from wastewater treatment plants e g ohkouchi et al 2007 can et al 2013 and b cyanobacteria in water reservoirs and lakes in watersheds e g rapala et al 2002 in the present study the source water samples obtained from the four dwpps dwpp a1 b2 c and d were mostly affected by effluents from several wastewater treatment plants located upstream of their source rivers the effluent from wastewater treatment plants as well as the occurrence of cyanobacteria would have significant impacts on the elevated endotoxin activities in these surface water samples ohkouchi et al 2007 investigated endotoxin activities in the effluent from a wastewater treatment plant 10 800 eu ml and pointed out that the level of endotoxin activity in river water would markedly increase downstream of the effluents from wastewater treatment plants the sample from dwpp b1 was also affected by the sporadic occurrence of algal blooms the highest total et 236 7 eu ml was observed at dwpp b1 and was probably due to the sporadic occurrence of cyanobacteria e g microcystis spp and anabaena spp in reservoir b average ratios of free et to total et for river and reservoir water samples were within the range of 0 49 0 67 and were comparable to a previous study in china approximately 0 54 0 67 can et al 2013 fluctuations of total et observed in these surface water samples fig 1 were probably due to various external conditions including seasonal variations in river water flow discharge rates of effluent from wastewater treatment plants and occurrence of cyanobacteria in the reservoir on the other hand total et levels in groundwater samples were much lower than those in the surface water samples probably due to the absence of wastewater contamination in the groundwater interestingly raw water of dwpp e withdrawn from the shallow aquifer affected by penetration of nearby river water had much lower total et 0 03 0 01 eu ml than that of dwpp a2 withdrawn from the deep aquifer 0 27 0 08 eu ml this was in accordance with the occurrence of hpc in the samples hpc in the raw water of dwpp e was 1 8 2 7 101 cfu ml and was much lower than that of dwpp a2 4 2 6 6 102 cfu ml the nearby river water contains the effluent of several upstream wastewater treatment plants and thus total et and hpc were significantly higher than other river water samples 476 7 168 5 eu ml and 1 3 0 9 106 cfu ml respectively most of heterotrophic bacteria as well as endotoxins could be removed during the course of penetration via the riverbed total et in the groundwater samples withdrawn at healthcare facilities were slightly higher at hcf q 0 50 0 09 eu ml or much higher at hcf r 3 23 2 33 eu ml than at dwpp a2 and e hpc levels in hcf r samples were also notably higher 1 5 1 2 103 cfu ml than that in other groundwater samples reflecting the severe deterioration of groundwater quality around hcf r 4 2 occurrence and fate of the endotoxin activity in the water purification process mixed effects on the decrease in the endotoxin activity were observed in the course of the water purification process at the seven dwpps fig 4 summarizes the decrease ratios of free et and bound et for each purification process or a series of purification processes compared with those in water samples just prior to each process negative values indicate that the water purification process caused an increase in the endotoxin activity 4 2 1 chemical coagulation and sedimentation average decrease ratios of free et and bound et by chemical coagulation using polyaluminum followed by gravity sedimentation were 86 5 8 5 and 60 8 37 5 respectively fig 4 a there results were better than or comparable to can s study at a single dwpp in beijing in which up to 52 of free et and up to 72 of bound et were removed by the combination of coagulation and sedimentation processes can et al 2013 free et was mostly decreased by this process and its decrease ratios were stable rietschel et al 1993 reported that the primary structure of lipid a derived from various bacteria elucidated by previous studies contains a hydroxyl group and other hydrophilic groups free endotoxins and polyaluminum chloride can be held together by an ionic bond and sedimented on the other hand variation of bound et decrease ratios was observed in this study bound et after coagulation sedimentation would be from gram negative bacteria and cyanobacteria not aggregated into coagulation flocs and or not settled in sedimentation tanks thus the variation would probably be due to different conditions for floc formation i e coagulant dose raw water quality e g ph water temperature and turbidity and also the strength of subsequent mixing this was also supported by the wide variety of hpc decrease ratios by this process calculated by dividing hpc after coagulation sedimentation by hpc in river water within the range of 5 8 4 3 10 5 to 1 0 1 6 100 as a consequence ratios of free et to total et were significantly decreased by chemical coagulation and sedimentation fig 1 a c d e and f 4 2 2 rapid sand filtration in contrast to chemical coagulation and sedimentation physical removal of bound et by rapid sand filtration rsf was much more effective than that of free et 69 0 19 4 and 9 8 23 8 respectively fig 4 a during this process bound et associated with particles including dead alive gram negative bacteria and cyanobacteria cells would be efficiently sieved by the sand filter on the other hand most of the free et dissolved in water would pass through the sand filter because its molecular size is estimated approximately 10 20 kda petsch and anspach 2000 and it would be hardly removed it is notable that ozonation prior to rapid sand filtration conducted at dwpp b1 and c could cause statistically significant increases in free et in the filtrate fig 4 a p 0 004 anderson et al 2008 observed an increase of total endotoxin in filtrates of their bench scale dual anthracite sand filtration enriched with nutrients and stimulated biofilm formation ozonation is also well known to increase microbial growth potential by decomposing persistent organic compounds into assimilable organic carbons and thus biofilm formation in sand filtration similar to that in biological activated carbon filtration would be likely to occur however backwashing of the rapid sand filter using finished i e chlorinated water typically conducted every 48 72 h in japanese dwpps should strongly affect biofilm formation in the sand filtration layer and the increase of endotoxin activity there 4 2 3 chemical oxidation chlorination and ozonation most recent studies at dwpps and wastewater treatment plants wwtps showed that decreases of endotoxin activity by chemical oxidation processes i e chlorination and ozonation were limited at a single dwpp in finland rapala et al 2002 reported decrease ratios of total et by chlorination and ozonation of 8 6 and 8 3 respectively can et al 2013 reported that total et in finished water increased slightly after final chlorine disinfection with significant release of free et and a decrease in bound et and concluded that chlorination induced free et release huang et al 2011 observed that chlorination could not effectively decrease endotoxin activity of secondary effluent of a wwtp and that chlorination of pure cultured e coli and a gram negative bacteria isolated from secondary sewage effluent resulted in a significant increase under 10 mg l initial chlorine dose for 30 min they also reported that both free et and bound et significantly increased after chlorination of pure cultured e coli under conditions of high initial dose 50 mg l 30 min in the present study decreases in endotoxin activity by these chemical oxidation processes were moderate and more effective against bound et than free et fig 4 b average decrease ratios of free et and bound et by primary chlorination at dwpp b1 and b2 were 14 0 30 5 and 27 9 18 5 and those by post chlorination i e final chlorine disinfection in most cases at all dwpps were 1 6 21 2 and 9 1 53 8 respectively this tendency was more significant for ozonation average decrease ratios of free et and bound et by mid ozonation at dwpp b1 and c were 17 7 23 2 and 63 9 10 7 and that by post ozonation at dwpp b1 c and d were 11 1 13 6 and 46 4 29 7 respectively moreover better efficiencies of endotoxin activity decrease at the early mid stage of chemical oxidation i e primary chlorination and mid ozonation were observed in accordance with higher injection ratios of chlorine and ozone conduced at each dwpp on the sampling dates table 4 according to these findings in the previous and present studies chemical oxidation processes would affect both decreases and increases in endotoxin activity via the following reactions 1 bound et increase by cell lysis 2 transformation of bound et to free et resulting in bound et decrease and free et increase and 3 free et decrease by decomposing primary structure of lipid a in the above reactions the reaction rate of lipid a decomposition might not be significant in the actual water purification processes this was supported by the fact that ratios of free et to total et significantly increased in ozonated water samples and finished water samples fig 1 anderson et al 2003 conducted laboratory scale inactivation experiments using a commercially available endotoxin derived from e coli o55 b5 i e free endotoxin by free chlorine monochloramine and potassium permanganate and reported inactivation rates of 1 4 1 0 and 0 7 eu ml h respectively judging from hydraulic retention times for post chlorination or final chlorine disinfection at the target dwpps approximately 3 6 h on average the contribution of free et decomposition by chlorination would be small more studies on the fate of endotoxin activity by chemical oxidation are necessary because the rates of these three reactions have not been elucidated in particular increase and decrease rates by ozonation 4 2 4 biological activated carbon filtration significant increases in endotoxin activity were observed at all dwpps employing the biological activated carbon bac filtration process i e dwpp b2 c and d and were mostly in agreement with previous studies burger et al 1989 rapala et al 2002 ohkouchi et al 2007 can et al 2013 in the present study the increase ratios of free et and bound et after bac filtration were 100 7 79 1 and 89 7 126 2 respectively heterotrophic plate counts were multiplied remarkably after this process except for dwpp b1 fig 2 so the increase in endotoxin activity was probably due to the release of alive dead gram negative bacteria inhabiting the activated carbon filter into the filtrate it is notable that both free et and bound et were increased at all dwpps in japan in this study and in that reported by ohkouchi et al 2007 on the other hand the change in free et was not significant at the dwpp in beijing can et al 2013 this difference in fate of free et by biological activated carbon filtration was probably due to the inclusion of ozonation just prior to bac filtration at japanese dwpps due to residual ozone in the influent of the bac filter some gram negative bacteria inside the activated carbon would be oxidized lysed and contribute to the increases in both bound et and free et as discussed in the previous section in addition post rapid sand filtration rsf solely implemented at dwpp d was quite effective to decrease free et and bound et again after bac filtration fig 4 c compares the decrease ratios of free et and bound et by ozonation plus bac dwpp b1 c and d and by ozonation bac plus post rsf dwpp d improvement in the decrease ratio of endotoxin activity was statistically significant for free et p 0 0004 but not statistically significant for bound et p 0 351 it should be noted that free et was efficiently decreased by post rsf without any additional chemical coagulant further investigation of the free et decrease here would be of interest in terms of mitigation of the elevated endotoxin activity by bac filtration 4 3 occurrence and fate of the endotoxin activity at the healthcare facilities 4 3 1 on site groundwater purification process at hcfs the on site groundwater purification process employed at hcf q consisting of rsf microfiltration and chlorination decreased most bound et and some free et in groundwater average bound et in raw water and on site treated water were 0 14 0 04 and 0 03 0 01eu ml and average free et in raw water and on site treated water were 0 32 0 08 and 0 19 0 03eu ml respectively rsf was implemented for removal of residual manganese and iron in groundwater and chemical coagulant was not applied here so removal of free bound et might be limited post microfiltration could be more significant for physical removal of most bound et some part of free et might also be removed by microfiltration despite its nominal pore size 0 05 10 μm larger than free et on the other hand another on site groundwater purification process employed at hcf r consisting of rapid sand filtration ozonation ultraviolet irradiation biological activated carbon filtration microfiltration and chlorination drastically increased both free et and bound et average bound et in raw water and on site treated water were 2 14 2 33 and 4 14 3 95eu ml and average free et in raw water and on site treated water were 1 09 0 58 and 15 3 8 27eu ml respectively it should be noted that hpc in raw groundwater of hcf r was much higher than those of other facilities by 1 3 orders of magnitude hcf r 2 0 102 2 6 103 cfu ml hcf q 1 1 9 3 101 cfu ml dwpp e 1 7 100 4 9 101 cfu ml thus possible high concentration of gram negative bacteria in source water along with chemical oxidation and biological activated carbon filtration processes could cause elevated level of endotoxin activity in finished water further investigations on this kind of on site groundwater purification system are necessary to identify key water purification processes and their operation maintenance conditions for mitigating endotoxin activity in water for healthcare facilities 4 3 2 water tanks and faucets at hcfs hpc increased during the course of transit from the water tank to faucets at all of the hcfs fig 2 but interestingly endotoxin activity did not always increase in the same manner increases in bound et and decreases in ratio of free et to total et were concurrently observed at hcf p and q it is possible that microbial regrowth in water service pipes would cause the increase in endotoxin activity on the other hand both free et and bound et decreased and ratio of free et to total et increased at hcf r possible explanations for this difference in fate of endotoxin and heterotrophic bacteria are much longer hydraulic retention time a few days and higher residual free chlorine level approximately 2 0 mg l in the water tank at hcf r as disaster countermeasures against huge earthquakes and catastrophic floods mostly accompanied by water outages this would possibly facilitate the degradation of both free and bound et during the course of transit from water tank to faucets considering the rates of both bound et and free et decomposition by chlorination as discussed before and could also cause a difference in microbial community in the water service pipes so the occurrence of gram negative bacteria might not be significant it will be of interest to conduct in depth studies on the differences in microbial communities contributing to the occurrence and fate of endotoxin activity in water supply systems including water source purification process e g biological activated carbon filtration water distribution network and faucets another issue is that hpc is not able to cover majority of the viable bacteria in water samples and limited information has been still available on the occurrence and fate of viable bacteria contributing to the endotoxin activity development of more appropriate indicators and methodologies that cover the majority of gram negative bacteria releasing endotoxin into water e g fluorescence staining and flow cytometry would be helpful in the future studies 4 4 implications of residual endotoxin activity in water for dialysis therapy the occurrence and fate of endotoxin activity in water supplied to healthcare facilities as the raw water for dialysis therapy have been attracting a great deal of attention from medical practitioners and medical engineers to ensure microbial quality in the dialysis water by on site ultrapure water production systems elevated endotoxin activity in the raw water typically along with elevated microbial contamination is a matter of great concern in the management of on site ultrapure water production by increasing the burden to ro and uf membrane modules and possibly deteriorating microbial water quality in dialysis water for the preparation of dialysis fluid kawanishi et al 2009 in this regard it is desirable for healthcare facilities conducting dialysis therapy to obtain water with as low as possible endotoxin activity as elucidated in this study the occurrence and fate of endotoxin activity in water are strongly dependent on the water sources and configuration of the water purification processes in both municipal and private water supply systems bacterial regrowth in water tanks and water service pipes on the premises would also contribute to the increase in endotoxin activity along with heterotrophic bacteria little information regarding these issues is available for medical professionals in hcfs moreover the needs for high quality water for medical practices i e lowering the endotoxin activity and viable microbes in water for dialysis therapy are poorly acknowledged by professionals in water supply engineering including researchers academics and managers engineers of water utilities collaborations between these professionals would be worthwhile for mitigating endotoxin activity e g sharing microbial water quality monitoring data occurrence of hazardous events in water sources e g cyanobacterial blooms in water reservoirs and strengthening water purification processes to further decrease the remaining endotoxin activity in water for dialysis therapy 5 conclusions the present study elucidated the occurrence and fate of endotoxin activity from source water of dwpps to tap water of hcfs in japan including various conventional advanced water purification processes endotoxin activities in river water and reservoir water were much higher than those in groundwater physical removal processes by chemical coagulation and sedimentation rapid sand filtration and membrane filtration were highly effective to decrease both free et and bound et moderate decreases in bound et and limited decreases in free et were observed by chemical oxidation processes i e chlorination and ozonation bacterial activated carbon filtration was a major cause of significant increase in endotoxin activity in the course of drinking water purification process however post rapid sand filtration mitigated the endotoxin activity again levels of residual endotoxin activity in water supplied to hcfs were strongly affected by their source waters and the configurations of water purification processes served microbial regrowth on the premises from water tanks to faucets could also contribute to increases in endotoxin activity at hcfs

surfaces the nom coating layer prevented salt induced coagulation of ag2s nps and the effects of bsa and srha on ag2s nps stabilizing were more obvious than that of srfa and alginate flow cytometry analysis results suggested that bsa and srha were more effective on alleviating the ag2s nps induced cell escherichia coli membrane damage than srfa and alginate after interpreting the electrophoretic

consumption or washing of relevant products under anaerobic conditions ag nps were transformed into ag2s nps kaegi et al 2013 kim et al 2010 lowry et al 2012 ag2s nps containing products such as

wang et al 2017 compared with other nps such as ag nps and carbon based nanomaterials the toxicity effect of ag2s nps mainly lies in cell np interaction reinsch et al 2012 hence studying the influence

hydrodynamic diameter increased to 1 5 times of the initial hydrodynamic diameter chowdhury et al 2015 li et al 2017b attachment efficiency value known as the inverse stability ratio 1 w was used to quantify the aggregation behavior of ag2s nps under various conditions it was defined as normalizing the measured k by aggregation rate constant k fast obtained under the diffusion limited conditions where the aggregation rate was independent of the electrolyte concentrations since the concentration of ag2s nps in aggregation experiments was identical the attachment efficiency value could be calculated by the initial slope of the aggregation profile at a specific electrolyte concentration i e dd h t dt normalized under diffusion limited aggregation conditions i e dd h t dt fast sheng et al 2016 7 α 1 w k k fast 1 n 0 d d h t d t t 0 1 n 0 fast d d h t d t t 0 fast to calculate the attachment efficiency values in the presence of nom the k fast value was obtained from the average values of k fast in the diffusion limited regime of relevant salt solutions 2 4 studying the ag2s nps aggregation kinetics with dlvo theory the aggregation kinetics of nom coated ag2s nps in electrolyte solutions is consistent with the dlvo theory the theoretical attachment efficiency value of aggregating ag2s nps could be predicted by eq 8 chen and elimelech 2009 8 α 1 w 0 β h exp v a h k b t 2 a h 2 d h 0 β h exp v t h k b t 2 a h 2 d h where h was the separation distance between the two surfaces of approaching particles m a was the particle radius measured by dls k b was the boltzmann constant and t was the absolute temperature 298 13 k the van der waals attraction v a h was calculated according to the expression proposed by gregory 1981 that accounts for the electromagnetic retardation effect the total interaction energy between the two particles v t h was the sum of the electrical double layer interaction energy v edl h and the van der waals attraction energy v a h v edl h was calculated by the linear superposition approximation gregory 1975 the dimensionless function β h was calculated based on previous reported method honig et al 1971 more detailed calculation procedures were provided in text s2 2 5 toxicity assay the cell membrane damage caused by ag2s nps and the nom coated ag2s nps to pure culture e coli was determined with flow cytometry based on previously described methods liu et al 2018 wang et al 2018 in the experiment 1 ml of e coli was inoculated into reactors containing ag2s nps 100 mg l or nom coated ag2s nps the concentrations of ag2s nps and nom were 100 mg l and 38 5 mgc l respectively ag2s nps are suspended in 5 mm cacl2 and incubated for 36 h at 30 c then the solution samples were filtered through a nylon screen of 25 μm pore size and detected by a flow cytometer becton dickinson co ca samples were diluted to make sure that the concentration of the microbe was below 3 105 cells ml and then double stained with propidium iodide and sybr green i 10 μl ml and incubated in the dark for 10 min at 30 c green and red fluorescence signals were collected in fl1 520 nm and fl3 channel 615 nm each group contains 3 replicates 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the prepared ag2s nps the synthesized ag2s nps are spherical and monodispersed fig s1a their average size is 11 8 2 4 nm according to the size distribution histogram fig s1e edx spectra of ag2s nps cluster fig s1d suggested that the nanoparticles are composed of sulfur and silver and the hr tem image fig s1b showed clear lattice planes with d spacing of about 0 26 nm which could be indexed as 121 facet of monoclinic ag2s saed result fig s1c showed that the particle crystalline structure is monoclinic ag2s the intensities and positions of xrd peaks fig s1f of the nanoparticles matched well with the standard ag2s phases jcpds no 14 0072 and further confirmed that the nanoparticles are the monoclinic acanthite ag2s the electrophoretic mobility of ag2s nps varied from 1 59 10 8 m2v 1s 1 to 3 62 10 8 m2v 1s 1 as the solution ph increased from 2 to 10 suggesting that the particles are negatively charged under these ph conditions the hydrodynamic size of prepared ag2s nps is 47 2 2 7 nm fig s2a with a polydispersity index of 0 33 0 06 indicating their excellent monodispersion no aggregation of ag2s nps was observed in deionized water fig s2 3 2 salt induced aggregation the aggregation kinetics of ag2s nps in the existence of coexisting ions were initially investigated fig 1 a b and c show the variation of ag2s nps hydrodynamic diameter as a function of electrolyte concentration the aggregation behaviors of ag2s nps exhibited dlvo type interactions in three electrolytes nacl mgcl2 and cacl2 the aggregation rates increased with the elevation of electrolyte concentrations and then became independent when the electrolyte concentration surpassed certain threshold critical coagulation concentration ccc for instance the aggregation of ag2s nps was accelerated when increasing the concentration of nacl at low regime 0 350 mm when the nacl concentration surpassed 350 mm the increase of ag2s nps hydrodynamic diameter became slow similar phenomena were observed in mgcl2 and cacl2 solutions fig 1b and c while the electrolyte concentration thresholds were much lower compared with that in nacl solution 4 mm for mgcl2 and 2 5 mm for cacl2 this indicates that compared with monovalent cation na the effects of divalent cations ca2 and mg2 on ag2s nps aggregation were intense after normalizing the initial slope of the particle aggregation profile the ag2s nps attachment efficiency was calculated fig 1d the attachment efficiency showed biphasic profile at low concentration regime the attachment efficiency values were lower than 1 and this regime was defined as reaction limited aggregation rla regime as the attachment efficiency value was around 1 the regime was defined as diffusion limited aggregation dla regime broide and cohen 1990 the minimum electrolyte concentration for the occurrence of dla was defined as critical coagulation concentration ccc lagaly and ziesmer 2003 romanello and fidalgo de cortalezzi 2013 for the ag2s nps in nacl solution the ccc value was 275 mm when the nacl concentration is below 275 mm the particles were in rla regime and the attachment efficiency increased with the increase of nacl concentration the na would interact with negatively charged ag2s nps and lead to the drop of particle electrostatic energy barrier thus increase the particle attachment efficiency when the nacl concentration surpassed the ccc value the particle energy barrier would be eliminated and the particle attachment efficiency became steady attachment efficiency value 1 further increasing nacl concentration would not influence the particle attachment efficiency and lead to the aggregation compared with that in nacl solution the ag2s nps ccc values in mgcl2 and cacl2 solutions were much lower 2 5 mm for cacl2 and 4 0 mm for mgcl2 respectively this result agrees with the electrophoretic mobility measurements fig 1e the charge of ag2s nps in mgcl2 and cacl2 solution was appreciably less negative than that in nacl solution divalent cation is more effective on screening the surface negative charge than that of monovalent cation at the same molarity in addition the lower ccc value of ag2s nps in cacl2 solution than that in mgcl2 solution is possibly due to the higher hydration shell thickness of mg2 3 63 å than ca2 3 13 å li et al 2017b which can attenuate the affinity of cations with the nps xia et al 2017 compared with the reported ccc values of ag nps e g 40 mm for nacl and 2 mm for cacl2 crittenden et al 2012 li et al 2010 the determined ccc values of ag2s nps are higher this suggests that the ag2s nps are against self aggregation compared with ag nps in aquatic environments meanwhile the ccc values of ag2s nps are higher than the equivalent ionic strengths of surface water and groundwater chapman and organization 1996 but lower than that of seawater hem 1985 this indicates that the ag2s nps are easier to aggregate and deposit in estuaries than that in surface water and ground water fig 1f shows the comparison of attachment efficiency values obtained from experimental data and the model fitting results as a function of nacl concentration ph 7 0 the correlation index r2 between the determined attachment efficiency values and the theoretical dlvo prediction is 0 993 one critical assumption of dlvo theory is that the charge is homogeneously distributed on the particle surface the agreement between experimental data and the model fitting result r2 0 993 suggests that the charge is uniformly distributed on the ag2s nps surface the determined hamaker constant for ag2s nps in aqueous solution was 0 92 10 20 j in comparison studies reported that the hamaker constants of ag nps tio2 nps ceo2 nps and c60 are 2 9 0 8 10 20 j 26 10 20 j 5 57 10 20 j and 0 85 10 20 j respectively butt et al 2005 chen and elimelech 2009 huynh and chen 2011 karimian and babaluo 2007 the hamaker constant of ag2s nps was the lowest compared with that of the metal oxide nanoparticles and similar with that of c60 this indicates that the van der waals forces among ag2s nps were weaker than that of ag nps tio2 nps and ceo2 nps and the aggregation property of ag2s nps is poor 3 3 influence of nom on the salt induced aggregation humic substances are the background substances existing in natural waters microbes would release extracellular polymeric substance into natural water and these organics contain large amount of polysaccharide and protein wu et al 2014 natural macromolecular organics would interact with the engineered nanoparticles through chemical and physical processes and affect their environment behavior the effects of srfa srha alginate and bsa on the variation of ag2s nps attachment efficiency and epms were examined fig 2 as discussed in above section the ccc value of ag2s nps was 275 mm in nacl solution after 1mgc l of srfa alginate srha and bsa was added into the solution the ccc values increased to 350 mm 400 mm 800 mm and 1200 mm respectively fig 2a for the particles in cacl2 solution the ccc values increased from 2 5 mm to 3 mm 7 5 mm and 21 mm respectively after srfa srha and bsa were added fig 2b the presence of humic substances and biomacromolecules alleviated the aggregation of ag2s nps among these bsa exhibited the strongest stabilization effect the highest ccc values in nacl and cacl2 solution following by srha alginate and srfa in nacl solution the attachment efficiency of ag2s nps in the dla regime was significantly lower than 1 with the presence of bsa and srha fig 2a this suggests that bsa and srha strongly stabilized the ag2s nps and suppressed their aggregation previous study also reported that humic acid would decrease the attachment efficiency of fullerene nanoparticle in mgcl2 solution chen and elimelech 2007 the steric repulsion caused by the adsorbed bsa and srha molecular may enhance the stability of ag2s nps and inhibit their aggregation in comparison the ag2s nps attachment efficiency surpassed 1 with the presence of alginate in cacl2 solution cacl2 concentration 3 mm chemically alginate can react with ca2 with the formation of gel pellet pillay and fassihi 1999 the micro gel pellets would coat on ag2s nps and further aggregate fig s3 thus lead to the keep increasing of ag2s nps attachment efficiency in both solutions negligible differences of electrophoretic mobilities of ag2s nps are observed in the presence of srfa and alginate fig 2c and d in comparison bsa decreased the absolute electrophoretic mobility value of ag2s nps fig 2d this means that the electrostatic repulsive forces between ag2s nps decreased and the decreasing of electrostatic repulsive forces is in favor for the aggregation of nanoparticles these results suggest that bsa has dual function on ag2s nps 1 bsa would decrease the electrostatic repulsive forces between ag2s nps and be in favor for their aggregation 2 bsa would coat on the ag2s nps surface which enhance the stability of nanoparticles above results fig 2a and b showed that bsa would lead to the aggregation of ag2s nps in salt solutions hence the steric repulsive force caused by the adsorbed bsa molecular rather than the electrostatic repulsive force caused by bsa was the dominant force for the stabilization of ag2s nps this result could also explain that srha was more effective on ag2s nps stabilization than that of srfa as the average molecular weight of srha is larger than that of srfa the number average molecular weights of srha and srfa were 1605 and 1262 da respectively the weight average molecular weights of srha and srfa were 5692 and 2155 da respectively guéguen and cuss 2011 previous studies also claimed that the globular architecture of bsa could induce larger steric repulsive forces than linear structural macro molecules such as humic substances and alginate saleh et al 2010 3 4 toxicity assay according to above results the srha and bsa would coat on the surfaces of ag2s nps and thus prevent their salt induced aggregation in comparison the effects of srfa and alginate on preventing salt induced aggregation of ag2s nps were unobvious the physical size and aggregation behavior of nanoparticle would influence its toxicity huynh et al 2014 the escherichia coli cultured in ag2s nps solutions containing srfa srha alginate and bsa was double stained with propidium iodide and sybr green i and the integrity of microbe cell was investigated by flow cytometry fig 3 sybr greeni could penetrate microbe cell membrane and combine with dna molecular thus emitting green fluorescence in comparison propidium iodide only enters damaged cell and combines with the dna molecular emitting red fluorescence in flow cytometry analysis the microbes emitting green fluorescence represent intact cells and the microbes emitting red fluorescence represent damaged cells these two types of cells present in the different zone of the flow cytometry plot by calculating the ratio of damaged cells among the total microbe cells the degree of membrane integrity could be determined for the microbes cultured in the cacl2 solution without ag2s nps control group the membrane damage ratio was 0 this suggests that in the membrane integrity assay the cell structure of most microbes was intact however for the microbes cultured with 100 mg l of ag2s nps the membrane damage ratio was 16 3 2 7 the ag2s nps 100 mg l greatly affected the membrane integrity of e coli compared with that in ag2s nps 100 mg l group the membrane integrity ratios of e coli in srfa srha alginate and bsa groups largely decreased for the e coli in srfa and srha groups their membrane integrity ratios were 11 2 1 4 and 5 1 0 8 respectively this suggests that compared with srfa srha was more effective on attenuating the cell damage of e coli caused by ag2s nps in above sections we found that compared with srfa srha would coat onto the ag2s nps surface and thus prevent their salt induced aggregation the srha coating may also alleviate the interaction between ag2s nps and e coli and thus decrease their membrane damage ratio for the e coli in alginate and bsa groups their membrane integrity ratios were 6 8 0 4 and 0 9 0 3 respectively compared with those in ag2s nps solution without bio macromolecules the membrane damage of e coli cell in both groups was alleviated by 58 and 94 respectively bsa was more effective on alleviating the cell damage caused by ag2s nps compared with that of alginate 3 5 mechanism analysis the particles coated with nom can be recognized as soft particles compared with the bare particles and the physical properties of the coating layer such as thickness softness surface potential and charge density could be interpreted by ohshima s soft particle theory ohshima 1995 on the other hand the physical behavior aggregation dispersion collision etc of ag2s nps is correlated with the properties of the nom coating layer zhang et al 2013 and these physical behaviors would influence the interaction of ag2s nps with living systems tenzer et al 2013 by analyzing the relationship between the physical properties of the coating layer and the toxicity of relevant coated ag2s nps the effects of natural organic matter on antimicrobial activity of ag2s nps could be interpreted the epm data of ag2s nps was interpreted with the ohshima s soft particle theory to obtain the physical properties of the nom coating layers fig 4 the thicknesses of adsorbed nom layers were 2 3 nm srfa 2 5 nm srha 2 4 nm alginate and 7 7 nm bsa respectively the softness of bsa layer is the highest 3 23 nm these data indicate that compared with srfa srha and alginate coating the bsa coating is soft and thick the size of particle coated with bsa is also the largest compared with other particles in comparison the srfa coating is the thinnest and not as soft as other nom coatings fig 5 after being released into the environment the nps may undergo dissolution ros generation and cell np interaction process the dissolution and ros generation processes would lead to the formation of toxic ions and species which would inhibit the activity and metabolism of organisms and result in toxicity effects in comparison the cell np interaction process would lead to cell membrane damage ag2s nps are highly insoluble ksp 6 10 51 the membrane damage of e coli caused by ag2s nps mainly lies in the direct physical contact when ag2s nps interact with organic matter such as srha srfa alginate and bsa the organics could coat on the particle surface and expand their physical size fig 5 meanwhile the organic coating layer is soft and not as hard as that of naked nps when the nps coated with nom interact with cells the organic coating layer would act as a cushion to reduce the contact force between nps and cell membrane nel et al 2009 tenzer et al 2013 thus alleviating the cell membrane damage by analyzing the toxicity assay results and the parameters of ag2s nps the level of e coli membrane damage is negatively correlated with the coating layer thickness correlation coefficient 0 869 p 0 055 and softness correlation coefficient 0 798 p 0 105 fig s4 these results indicate that the organic matter would coat on the surface of nps and attenuate their toxicity caused by physical contact meanwhile both the nom layer and the microbe cell were negatively charged under neutral ph condition the electrostatic repulsive force between nom layer and microbe cell would also decrease their physical contact zhu et al 2012 considering that the toxicity effects of many nanomaterials such as graphene carbon nanotube etc mainly lie in the direct physical contact with cell liu et al 2013 zhao et al 2017 ohshima s soft particle theory may be useful for understanding the effects and reaction mechanism of nom on the toxicity of nanomaterials considering that nom ubiquitously exists in the environment their interactions with engineered nanomaterials such as coating bridging and binding may be responsible for eliminating the environmental risk of exposed nanomaterials 4 conclusions this study explored the effects of humic substances and biomacromolecules on the aggregation and toxicity of ag2s nanoparticles in aqueous solution the following conclusions were obtained 1 the aggregation behavior of ag2s nps was highly dependent on the solution properties such as types and concentrations of the electrolyte the critical coagulation concentrations of ag2s nps in nacl cacl2 and mgcl2 solution were 275 mm 2 5 mm and 4 0 mm respectively divalent cations ca2 and mg2 were more effective on accelerating ag2s nps aggregation than that of monovalent cation 2 ag2s nps aggregation kinetics was in accordance with dlvo theory in the absence of nom the determined hamaker constant of ag2s nps was 0 92 10 20 j after ag nps were sulfurized the mobility of ag nps would be enhanced due to the low hamaker constant of ag2s nps 3 the effects of bsa and srha on ag2s nps stabilizing were more obvious than that of alginate and srfa compared with electrostatic repulsive force steric repulsive force was the dominant force for increasing the stability of ag2s nps 4 the nom coating layer may cushion the physical force between ag2s nps and e coli and thus alleviate their cell membrane damage ohshima s soft particle theory could be used to examine the properties of the nom coating layer thickness and softness of the nom coating layer were negatively correlated with the membrane damage of e coli induced by ag2s nps

19289,natural organic matter nom ubiquitously exists in natural waters and would adsorb onto the particle surface previous studies showed that nom would alleviate the toxicity of nanomaterials while the mechanism is seldom quantitatively interpreted herein the effects of humic substances suwannee river fulvic acid srfa and suwannee river humic acid srha and biomacromolecules alginate and bovine serum albumin bsa on the aggregation and antimicrobial effects of silver sulfide nanoparticles ag2s nps were investigated the aggregation kinetics of ag2s nps in electrolyte solutions were in agreement with the results based on derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory the dynamic light scattering dls results showed that the srfa srha alginate and bsa molecules coated on the ag2s nps surfaces the nom coating layer prevented salt induced coagulation of ag2s nps and the effects of bsa and srha on ag2s nps stabilizing were more obvious than that of srfa and alginate flow cytometry analysis results suggested that bsa and srha were more effective on alleviating the ag2s nps induced cell escherichia coli membrane damage than srfa and alginate after interpreting the electrophoretic mobility epm data of the nom coated ag2s nps by ohshima s soft particle theory it was found that the thickness of the nom coating layers followed the orders of bsa srha alginate srfa the e coli cell membrane damage level was negatively correlated with the thickness and softness of the coating layer nom coating may physically alleviate the contact between nps and e coli cells and thus attenuate the extent of cell membrane damage caused by the np cell interaction this work provides a new perspective for quantitatively interpreting the influence of nom on the environmental behaviors and risks

nanomaterials is a complex process which largely depends on the physical and chemical properties of the investigated nom jiang et al 2015 philippe and schaumann 2014 there have been limited studies quantitatively investigating the function of nom on the environmental behavior of nps by investigating the aggregation behavior of suspended particles the particle electrophoretic mobility epm value

concentration of electrolyte using a nonlinear least square optimization algorithm the ohshima s soft particle theory could be a useful tool for understanding the structural and conformational information of the nom coating layer ag nps including agcl and metallic ag nps were added into consumer products as deodorizers and disinfectants these ag nps would be released into waters after the consumption or washing of relevant products under anaerobic conditions ag nps were transformed into ag2s nps kaegi et al 2013 kim et al 2010 lowry et al 2012 ag2s nps containing products such as optical filters photodetectors solar cells magnetic field sensors etc were also largely used mir et al 2015 yang et al 2017 ag2s nps are stable and their solubility in water ksp 5 92 10 51 is negligible levard et al 2012 thus ag2s nps were frequently detected in natural waters khaksar et al 2015 li et al 2016 and raised increasing concerns due to the associated toxic impacts li et al 2017a wang et al 2017 compared with other nps such as ag nps and carbon based nanomaterials the toxicity effect of ag2s nps mainly lies in cell np interaction reinsch et al 2012 hence studying the influence of nom on the aggregation and toxicity of ag2s nps could be a concise way for understanding the relation between the properties of nom and the environmental behavior of nps the objectives of this study are i to investigate the stability of ag2s nps in electrolyte solution and determine the key parameters for modeling the environmental fate of ag2s nps in aquatic system ii to evaluate the effects of typical nom suwannee river fulvic acid srfa suwannee river humic acid srha alginate and bovine serum albumin bsa on stabilizing the ag2s nps in electrolyte solution iii to examine the

injected into a clean dls glass cuvette malvern instruments worcestershire u k and electrolyte stock solutions were subsequently added end concentration of nacl ranged from 125 mm to 600 mm end concentration of cacl2 and mgcl2 ranged from 1 mm to 10 mm the final volume of the mixture was maintained at 1 5 ml and the concentration of ag2s nps was 2 6 mg l the prepared ag2s nps are spherical and the average diameter is 11 8 nm figure s1 the content of ag2s nps is 4 2 1011 particles ml in the suspension during the aggregation experiments for the test solutions containing nom similar operation procedures were conducted except that the nom stock solution was injected into the cuvette prior to the addition of electrolyte the samples were immediately vortexed less than 2 s and then added into the light scattering unit all the aggregation experiments were replicated with three times the electrophoretic mobility of ag2s nps in different solutions containing srha srfa alginate and bsa respectively was measured by zetasizer nano zs90 malvern uk samples were prepared in the same procedures as described in the aggregation experiments 2 3 determination of aggregation kinetics the initial aggregation rate constant k of ag2s nps was proportional to the early increase rate of d h xu et al 2016 6 k 1 n 0 d d h t d t t 0 where n 0 was the primary ag2s nps concentration and d h t

values of k fast in the diffusion limited regime of relevant salt solutions 2 4 studying the ag2s nps aggregation kinetics with dlvo theory the aggregation kinetics of nom coated ag2s nps in electrolyte solutions is consistent with the dlvo theory the theoretical attachment efficiency value of aggregating ag2s nps could be predicted by eq 8 chen and elimelech 2009 8 α 1 w 0 β h exp v a h k b t 2 a h 2 d h 0 β h exp v t h k b t 2 a h 2 d h where h was the separation distance between the two surfaces of approaching particles m a was the particle radius measured by dls k b was the boltzmann constant and t was the absolute temperature 298 13 k the van der waals attraction v a h was calculated according to the expression proposed by gregory 1981 that accounts for the electromagnetic retardation effect the total interaction energy between the two particles v t h was the sum of the electrical double layer interaction energy v edl h and the van der waals attraction energy v a h v edl h was calculated by the linear superposition approximation gregory 1975 the dimensionless function β h was calculated based on previous reported method honig et al 1971 more detailed calculation procedures were provided in text s2 2 5 toxicity assay the cell membrane damage caused by ag2s nps and the nom coated ag2s nps to pure culture e coli was determined with flow cytometry based on previously described methods liu et al 2018 wang et al 2018 in the experiment 1 ml of e coli was inoculated into reactors containing ag2s nps 100 mg l or nom coated ag2s nps the concentrations of ag2s nps and nom were 100 mg l and 38 5 mgc l respectively ag2s nps are suspended in 5 mm cacl2 and incubated for 36 h at 30 c then the solution samples were filtered through a nylon screen of 25 μm pore size and detected by a flow cytometer becton dickinson co ca samples were diluted to make sure that the concentration of the microbe was below 3 105 cells ml and then double stained with propidium iodide and sybr green i 10 μl ml and incubated in the dark for 10 min at 30 c green and red fluorescence signals were collected in fl1 520 nm and fl3 channel 615 nm each group contains 3 replicates 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the prepared ag2s nps the synthesized ag2s nps are spherical and monodispersed fig s1a their average size is 11 8 2 4 nm according to the size distribution histogram fig s1e edx spectra of ag2s nps cluster fig s1d suggested that the nanoparticles are composed of sulfur and silver and the hr tem image fig s1b showed clear lattice planes with d spacing of about 0 26 nm which could be indexed as 121 facet of monoclinic ag2s saed result fig s1c showed that the particle crystalline structure is monoclinic ag2s the intensities and positions of xrd peaks fig s1f of the nanoparticles matched well with the standard ag2s phases jcpds no 14 0072 and further confirmed that the nanoparticles are the monoclinic acanthite ag2s the electrophoretic mobility of ag2s nps varied from 1 59 10 8 m2v 1s 1 to 3 62 10 8 m2v 1s 1 as the solution ph increased from 2 to 10 suggesting that the particles are negatively charged under these ph conditions the hydrodynamic size of prepared ag2s nps is 47 2 2 7 nm fig s2a with a polydispersity index of 0 33 0 06 indicating their excellent monodispersion no aggregation of ag2s nps was observed in deionized water fig s2 3 2 salt induced aggregation the aggregation kinetics of ag2s nps in the existence of coexisting ions were initially investigated fig 1 a b and c show the variation of ag2s nps hydrodynamic diameter as a function of electrolyte concentration the aggregation behaviors of ag2s nps exhibited dlvo type interactions in three electrolytes nacl mgcl2 and cacl2 the aggregation rates increased with the elevation of electrolyte concentrations and then became independent when the electrolyte concentration surpassed certain threshold critical coagulation concentration ccc for instance the aggregation of ag2s nps was accelerated when increasing the concentration of nacl at low regime 0 350 mm when the nacl concentration surpassed 350 mm the increase of ag2s nps hydrodynamic diameter became slow similar phenomena were observed in mgcl2 and cacl2 solutions fig 1b and c while the electrolyte concentration thresholds were much lower compared with that in nacl solution 4 mm for mgcl2 and 2 5 mm for cacl2 this indicates that compared with monovalent cation na the effects of divalent cations ca2 and mg2 on ag2s nps aggregation were intense after normalizing the initial slope of the particle aggregation profile the ag2s nps attachment efficiency was calculated fig 1d the attachment efficiency showed biphasic profile at low concentration regime the attachment efficiency values were lower than 1 and this regime was defined as reaction limited aggregation rla regime as the attachment efficiency value was around 1 the regime was defined as diffusion limited aggregation dla regime broide and cohen 1990 the minimum electrolyte concentration for the occurrence of dla was defined as critical coagulation concentration ccc lagaly and ziesmer 2003 romanello and fidalgo de cortalezzi 2013 for the ag2s nps in nacl solution the ccc value was 275 mm when the nacl concentration is below 275 mm the particles were in rla regime and the attachment efficiency increased with the increase of nacl concentration the na would interact with negatively charged ag2s nps and lead to the drop of particle electrostatic energy barrier thus increase the particle attachment efficiency when the nacl concentration surpassed the ccc value the particle energy barrier would be eliminated and the particle attachment efficiency became steady attachment efficiency value 1 further increasing nacl concentration would not influence the particle attachment efficiency and lead to the aggregation compared with that in nacl solution the ag2s nps ccc values in mgcl2 and cacl2 solutions were much lower 2 5 mm for cacl2 and 4 0 mm for mgcl2 respectively this result agrees with the electrophoretic mobility measurements fig 1e the charge of ag2s nps in mgcl2 and cacl2 solution was appreciably less negative than that in nacl solution divalent cation is more effective on screening the surface negative charge than that of monovalent cation at the same molarity in addition the lower ccc value of ag2s nps in cacl2 solution than that in mgcl2 solution is possibly due to the higher hydration shell thickness of mg2 3 63 å than ca2 3 13 å li et al 2017b which can attenuate the affinity of cations with the nps xia et al 2017 compared with the reported ccc values of ag nps e g 40 mm for nacl and 2 mm for cacl2 crittenden et al 2012 li et al 2010 the determined ccc values of ag2s nps are higher this suggests that the ag2s nps are against self aggregation compared with ag nps in aquatic environments meanwhile the ccc values of ag2s nps are higher than the equivalent ionic strengths of surface water and groundwater chapman and organization 1996 but lower than that of seawater hem 1985 this indicates that the ag2s nps are easier to aggregate and deposit in estuaries than that in surface water and ground water fig 1f shows the comparison of attachment efficiency values obtained from experimental data and the model fitting results as a function of nacl concentration ph 7 0 the correlation index r2 between the determined attachment efficiency values and the theoretical dlvo prediction is 0 993 one critical assumption of dlvo theory is that the charge is homogeneously distributed on the particle surface the agreement between experimental data and the model fitting result r2 0 993 suggests that the charge is uniformly distributed on the ag2s nps surface the determined hamaker constant for ag2s nps in aqueous solution was 0 92 10 20 j in comparison studies reported that the hamaker constants of ag nps tio2 nps ceo2 nps and c60 are 2 9 0 8 10 20 j 26 10 20 j 5 57 10 20 j and 0 85 10 20 j respectively butt et al 2005 chen and elimelech 2009 huynh and chen 2011 karimian and babaluo 2007 the hamaker constant of ag2s nps was the lowest compared with that of the metal oxide nanoparticles and similar with that of c60 this indicates that the van der waals forces among ag2s nps were weaker than that of ag nps tio2 nps and ceo2 nps and the aggregation property of ag2s nps is poor 3 3 influence of nom on the salt induced aggregation humic substances are the background substances existing in natural waters microbes would release extracellular polymeric substance into natural water and these organics contain large amount of polysaccharide and protein wu et al 2014 natural macromolecular organics would interact with the engineered nanoparticles through chemical and physical processes and affect their environment behavior the effects of srfa srha alginate and bsa on the variation of ag2s nps attachment efficiency and epms were examined fig 2 as discussed in above section the ccc value of ag2s nps was 275 mm in nacl solution after 1mgc l of srfa alginate srha and bsa was added into the solution the ccc values increased to 350 mm 400 mm 800 mm and 1200 mm respectively fig 2a for the particles in cacl2 solution the ccc values increased from 2 5 mm to 3 mm 7 5 mm and 21 mm respectively after srfa srha and bsa were added fig 2b the presence of humic substances and biomacromolecules alleviated the aggregation of ag2s nps among these bsa exhibited the strongest stabilization effect the highest ccc values in nacl and cacl2 solution following by srha alginate and srfa in nacl solution the attachment efficiency of ag2s nps in the dla regime was significantly lower than 1 with the presence of bsa and srha fig 2a this suggests that bsa and srha strongly stabilized the ag2s nps and suppressed their aggregation previous study also reported that humic acid would decrease the attachment efficiency of fullerene nanoparticle in mgcl2 solution chen and elimelech 2007 the steric repulsion caused by the adsorbed bsa and srha molecular may enhance the stability of ag2s nps and inhibit their aggregation in comparison the ag2s nps attachment efficiency surpassed 1 with the presence of alginate in cacl2 solution cacl2 concentration 3 mm chemically alginate can react with ca2 with the formation of gel pellet pillay and fassihi 1999 the micro gel pellets would coat on ag2s nps and further aggregate fig s3 thus lead to the keep increasing of ag2s nps attachment efficiency in both solutions negligible differences of electrophoretic mobilities of ag2s nps are observed in the presence of srfa and alginate fig 2c and d in comparison bsa decreased the absolute electrophoretic mobility value of ag2s nps fig 2d this means that the electrostatic repulsive forces between ag2s nps decreased and the decreasing of electrostatic repulsive forces is in favor for the aggregation of nanoparticles these results suggest that bsa has dual function on ag2s nps 1 bsa would decrease the electrostatic repulsive forces between ag2s nps and be in favor for their aggregation 2 bsa would coat on the ag2s nps surface which enhance the stability of nanoparticles above results fig 2a and b showed that bsa would lead to the aggregation of ag2s nps in salt solutions hence the steric repulsive force caused by the adsorbed bsa molecular rather than the electrostatic repulsive force caused by bsa was the dominant force for the stabilization of ag2s nps this result could also explain that srha was more effective on ag2s nps stabilization than that of srfa as the average molecular weight of srha is larger than that of srfa the number average molecular weights of srha and srfa were 1605 and 1262 da respectively the weight average molecular weights of srha and srfa were 5692 and 2155 da respectively guéguen and cuss 2011 previous studies also claimed that the globular architecture of bsa could induce larger steric repulsive forces than linear structural macro molecules such as humic substances and alginate saleh et al 2010 3 4 toxicity assay according to above results the srha and bsa would coat on the surfaces of ag2s nps and thus prevent their salt induced aggregation in comparison the effects of srfa and alginate on preventing salt induced aggregation of ag2s nps were unobvious the physical size and aggregation behavior of nanoparticle would influence its toxicity huynh et al 2014 the escherichia coli cultured in ag2s nps solutions containing srfa srha alginate and bsa was double stained with propidium iodide and sybr green i and the integrity of microbe cell was investigated by flow cytometry fig 3 sybr greeni could penetrate microbe cell membrane and combine with dna molecular thus emitting green fluorescence in comparison propidium iodide only enters damaged cell and combines with the dna molecular emitting red fluorescence in flow cytometry analysis the microbes emitting green fluorescence represent intact cells and the microbes emitting red fluorescence represent damaged cells these two types of cells present in the different zone of the flow cytometry plot by calculating the ratio of damaged cells among the total microbe cells the degree of membrane integrity could be determined for the microbes cultured in the cacl2 solution without ag2s nps control group the membrane damage ratio was 0 this suggests that in the membrane integrity assay the cell structure of most microbes was intact however for the microbes cultured with 100 mg l of ag2s nps the membrane damage ratio was 16 3 2 7 the ag2s nps 100 mg l greatly affected the membrane integrity of e coli compared with that in ag2s nps 100 mg l group the membrane integrity ratios of e coli in srfa srha alginate and bsa groups largely decreased for the e coli in srfa and srha groups their membrane integrity ratios were 11 2 1 4 and 5 1 0 8 respectively this suggests that compared with srfa srha was more effective on attenuating the cell damage of e coli caused by ag2s nps in above sections we found that compared with srfa srha would coat onto the ag2s nps surface and thus prevent their salt induced aggregation the srha coating may also alleviate the interaction between ag2s nps and e coli and thus decrease their membrane damage ratio for the e coli in alginate and bsa groups their membrane integrity ratios were 6 8 0 4 and 0 9 0 3 respectively compared with those in ag2s nps solution without bio macromolecules the membrane damage of e coli cell in both groups was alleviated by 58 and 94 respectively bsa was more effective on alleviating the cell damage caused by ag2s nps compared with that of alginate 3 5 mechanism analysis the particles coated with nom can be recognized as soft particles compared with the bare particles and the physical properties of the coating layer such as thickness softness surface potential and charge density could be interpreted by ohshima s soft particle theory ohshima 1995 on the other hand the physical behavior aggregation dispersion collision etc of ag2s nps is correlated with the properties of the nom coating layer zhang et al 2013 and these physical behaviors would influence the interaction of ag2s nps with living systems tenzer et al 2013 by analyzing the relationship between the physical properties of the coating layer and the toxicity of relevant coated ag2s nps the effects of natural organic matter on antimicrobial activity of ag2s nps could be interpreted the epm data of ag2s nps was interpreted with the ohshima s soft particle theory to obtain the physical properties of the nom coating layers fig 4 the thicknesses of adsorbed nom layers were 2 3 nm srfa 2 5 nm srha 2 4 nm alginate and 7 7 nm bsa respectively the softness of bsa layer is the highest 3 23 nm these data indicate that compared with srfa srha and alginate coating the bsa coating is soft and thick the size of particle coated with bsa is also the largest compared with other particles in comparison the srfa coating is the thinnest and not as soft as other nom coatings fig 5 after being released into the environment the nps may undergo dissolution ros generation and cell np interaction process the dissolution and ros generation processes would lead to the formation of toxic ions and species which would inhibit the activity and metabolism of organisms and result in toxicity effects in comparison the cell np interaction process would lead to cell membrane damage ag2s nps are highly insoluble ksp 6 10 51 the membrane damage of e coli caused by ag2s nps mainly lies in the direct physical contact when ag2s nps interact with organic matter such as srha srfa alginate and bsa the organics could coat on the particle surface and expand their physical size fig 5 meanwhile the organic coating layer is soft and not as hard as that of naked nps when the nps coated with nom interact with cells the organic coating layer would act as a cushion to reduce the contact force between nps and cell membrane nel et al 2009 tenzer et al 2013 thus alleviating the cell membrane damage by analyzing the toxicity assay results and the parameters of ag2s nps the level of e coli membrane damage is negatively correlated with the coating layer thickness correlation coefficient 0 869 p 0 055 and softness correlation coefficient 0 798 p 0 105 fig s4 these results indicate that the organic matter would coat on the surface of nps and attenuate their toxicity caused by physical contact meanwhile both the nom layer and the microbe cell were negatively charged under neutral ph condition the electrostatic repulsive force between nom layer and microbe cell would also decrease their physical contact zhu et al 2012 considering that the toxicity effects of many nanomaterials such as graphene carbon nanotube etc mainly lie in the direct physical contact with cell liu et al 2013 zhao et al 2017 ohshima s soft particle theory may be useful for understanding the effects and reaction mechanism of nom on the toxicity of nanomaterials considering that nom ubiquitously exists in the environment their interactions with engineered nanomaterials such as coating bridging and binding may be responsible for eliminating the environmental risk of exposed nanomaterials 4 conclusions this study explored the effects of humic substances and biomacromolecules on the aggregation and toxicity of ag2s nanoparticles in aqueous solution the following conclusions were obtained 1 the aggregation behavior of ag2s nps was highly dependent on the solution properties such as types and concentrations of the electrolyte the critical coagulation concentrations of ag2s nps in nacl cacl2 and mgcl2 solution were 275 mm 2 5 mm and 4 0 mm respectively divalent cations ca2 and mg2 were more effective on accelerating ag2s nps aggregation than that of monovalent cation 2 ag2s nps aggregation kinetics was in accordance with dlvo theory in the absence of nom the determined hamaker constant of ag2s nps was 0 92 10 20 j after ag nps were sulfurized the mobility of ag nps would be enhanced due to the low hamaker constant of ag2s nps 3 the effects of bsa and srha on ag2s nps stabilizing were more obvious than that of alginate and srfa compared with electrostatic repulsive force steric repulsive force was the dominant force for increasing the stability of ag2s nps 4 the nom coating layer may cushion the physical force between ag2s nps and e coli and thus alleviate their cell membrane damage ohshima s soft particle theory could be used to examine the properties of the nom coating layer thickness and softness of the nom coating layer were negatively correlated with the membrane damage of e coli induced by ag2s nps
