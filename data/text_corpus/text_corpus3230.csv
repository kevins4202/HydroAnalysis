16150,information regarding water clarity at large spatiotemporal scales is critical for understanding comprehensive changes in the water quality and status of ecosystems previous studies have suggested that satellite observation is an effective means of obtaining such information however a reliable model for accurately mapping the water clarity of global lakes reservoirs is still lacking due to the high optical complexity of lake waters in this study by using gated recurrent units gru layers instead of full connected layers from artificial neural networks anns to capture the efficient sequence information of in situ datasets we propose a novel and transferrable hybrid deep learning based recurrent model dgrn to map the water clarity of global lakes with landsat 8 operational land imager oli images we trained and further validated the model using 1260 pairs of in situ measured water clarity and surface reflectance of landsat 8 oli images with google earth engine the model was subsequently utilized to construct the global pattern of temporal and spatial changes in water clarity lake area 10 km2 from 2014 to 2020 the results show that the model can estimate water clarity with good performance r2 0 84 mae 0 55 rmse 0 83 mape 45 13 the multi year average of water clarity for global lakes 16 475 lakes ranged from 0 0004 to 9 51 m with an average value of 1 88 1 24 m compared to the lake area elevation discharge residence time and the ratio of area to depth water depth was the most important factor that determined the global spatial distribution pattern of water clarity water clarity of 15 840 global lakes between 2014 and 2020 remained stable p 0 05 while there was a significant increase in 243 lakes p 0 05 and a decrease in 392 lakes p 0 05 however water clarity in 2020 covid 19 period showed a significant increase in most global lakes especially in china and canada suggesting that the worldwide lockdown strategy due to covid 19 might have improved water quality espically water clarity dueto the apparent reduction of anthropogenic activities graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords water clarity secchi disk depth deep learning landsat global lakes 1 introduction lakes reservoirs are essential components of the terrestrial aquatic system which occupy 3 7 of the earth s nonglaciated land area verpoorter et al 2014 as well as providing freshwater resources that support agricultural and industrial activities and regulating the regional climate change pekel et al 2016 visser et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 in recent years an increasing number of lakes are threatened by cyanobacterial blooms and extreme events due to the pronounced global warming leading to the grave threat on public health and aquatic ecosystem as a result of severe water quality crisis and degraded ecosystem services hou et al 2022 huisman et al 2018 woolway et al 2021 water clarity or water transparency expressed by the secchi disk depth sdd reflects the underwater light field and primary productivity of the aquatic system fee et al 1996 feng et al 2019 li et al 2020 providing synthetic information on lake quality and ecosystem status wang et al 2020 generally sdd is determined by a series of ecological and biogeochemical parameters in lakes such as chlorophyll a aquatic vegetation total suspended matter chromophoric dissolved organic matter particulate carbon and trophic status brezonik et al 2019 pham et al 2020 making it susceptible to external disturbance therefore sdd is a used as the most important indicators for assessing the status and the response of lakes to climate change and anthropogenic activities zhang et al 2021b 2014 lake sdd is sensitive to climate change and anthropogenic activities pekel et al 2016 wu et al 2009 zhang et al 2021c in light of the response of climate conditions to sdd lower concentrations of co2 were found to result in an increasing trend of sdd in small canadian shield lakes fee et al 1996 zhang et al 2014 revealed a significant positive correlation between air temperature and sdd in lake qiandaohu from 1987 to 2012 in the following studies zhang et al 2021c also indicated that warming and wetting conditions improve lake sdd by promoting the growth of vegetation melting of glaciers or expanding the lake area in inner mongolia in addition water clarity is also affected by anthropogenic activities such as chemical fertilizer use and wastewater discharge feng et al 2019 zhang et al 2021b feng et al 2019 quantitatively estimated and concluded that anthropogenic activities accounted for 50 of the large lake sdd in the yangtze plain furthermore the combined effects of air temperature rainfall cropland and industrial sewage accounted for 63 of the variation in sdd in the xin anjiang reservoir li et al 2020 recently the coronavirus pandemic covid 19 has constrained anthropogenic activities globally callejas et al 2021 tian et al 2020 yang et al 2021 which may result in an improvement of water clarity in lagoons callejas et al 2021 extensive studies on lake clarity have been conducted most of which however only focused on the spatiotemporal patterns of sdd in individual lakes or at the regional scale the trend and evolution of lake water clarity at the global scale remain unclear owing to the lack of high quality data and effective algorithms with high temporal and spatial coverage remote sensing has been widely used to derive sdd changes in inland waters using various inversion approaches the inversion approaches of sdd based on remote sensing images can be classified into the following three groups empirical models song et al 2022 zhang et al 2021c semi analytical models lee et al 2002 or analytical models preisendorfer 1986 empirical models rely on simple regressions between observation sdd and multiple bands of surface reflectance from satellites yentsch 1984 however it is subject to accuracy and requires plentiful mathch up in situ measurements lee et al 2016 song et al 2022 classic analytical modesls followed radiative treansfer theory preisendorfer 1986 however this theory could not explain the reaction mechanism of the human eye to the secchi disk which would be replaced by semi analytical algorithms lee et al 2015 semi analytical models for sdd such as the quasi analytical algorithm qaa are based on the solutions of radiative transfer equations le et al 2009 lee et al 2002 loisel and stramski 2000 which can achieve higher accuracy in many cases jiang et al 2019 lee et al 2016 zhan et al 2021 unfortunately it is difficult to apply the semi analytical to larger scales as the relationship between sdd and model parameters is not universal rodrigues et al 2017 recent studies have indicated that single or multi spectral empirical models can be applied to estimate sdd from lake scale li et al 2020 shi et al 2018 to regional olmanson et al 2008 ren et al 2018 national scales liu et al 2020 song et al 2020 zhang et al 2021c and global scale song et al 2022 however inadequate samples for capturing complex optical properties and simplified mechanistic descriptions of lake water inhibits the applications of such models on a large scale therefore an accurate efficient and transferrable algorithm for mapping global sdd is a prerequisite for analyzing trends and patterns of lake clarity change with the development of deep learning methods and in situ datasets instead of simple regression methods data driven approaches including artificial neural networks anns and recurrent neural networks rnns have become popular for estimating lake properties wen et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 zhu et al 2020a anns have a high potential for modeling non linear and complex natural systems huang et al 2015 panda et al 2010 reflecting variations in lake properties for example huang et al 2015 predicted the phytoplankton biomass of lake poyang using a single layer ann antonopoulos et al 2016 predicted daily evaporation using multiple ann structures in lake vegoritis pan et al 2016 embedded anns instead of process based models modflow to a genetic algorithm and achieved higher accuracy in predicting the surface and groundwater of the lake system rnns such as long short term memory networks lstms and gated recurrent units networks grus perform better at training and predicting sequence data because they can capture information from sequences zhang et al 2021a wen et al 2019 predicted water level variation in lake dongtinghu based on lstms zhang et al 2021a compared anns lstms and grus in predicting daily runoff in the muskegon and pearl rivers and demonstrated that rnns i e lstms and grus perform better than anns deep learning algorithms are powerful tools of depicting the changes of sdd at global scale however anns ignore the information of the sequence leading to the large uncertainty of temporal reconstruction in contrast rnns are better options for sequence information processing while are at risk of vanishing exploding gradients alom et al 2019 pascanu et al 2012 therefore to estimate water clarity precisely this study integrates anns and rnns in a robust way to map sdd at the global scale which not only includes the information of in situ measurements sequence but also overcomes the limitation of vanishing exploding gradients it is critical to develop a rigorously validated and efficient algorithm for mapping global sdd for an improved understanding of the spatiotemporal patterns of global lakes clarity under disturbance we thus hypothesized that 1 a deep learning based and globally adopted algorithm for mapping sdd would help diagnosing diverse trends and patterns of lake water clarity and 2 the global lake clarity changes were mainly influenced by lake specific characteristics and anthropogenic activities the innovation of this study is to acquire an accurate global dataset of sdd via a novel hybrid deep learning based model based on landsat 8 surface reflectance images and in situ measurements across time and space specific objectives are to 1 propose and develop a deep learning based inversion model at a global scale from 16 475 lakes area 10 km2 using in situ measured sdd data 2 apply to estimate the spatiotemporal pattern of global lakes sdd from 2014 to 2020 3 explore the attribution of lake specific characteristics to sdd and the spatial variability of global lakes sdd during the covid 19 pandemic in global lakes 2 data 2 1 in situ measured data we collected 1293 pairs of surface reflectance and in situ observed sdd fig s1 80 n 1034 of the samples were used for training and 20 n 259 for testing the in situ measured data were collected from field campaigns in 399 lakes across china america and europe specific information of those lakes are summarized in table s1 the 16 day repeated coverage period of the landsat 8 satellite inhibits collecting sufficient in situ measurements within a short interval nevertheless sampling within a seven day interval is a reasonable way of ensuring high performance as suggested in zhang et al 2021c it also provided sufficient match ups that were currently adopted for water clarity modeling at a large scale hou et al 2022 liu et al 2020 hence for both accuracy and efficiency the in situ measured surface reflectance acquired landsat surface reflectance images within a seven day interval to eliminate the uncertainty of sunlight in situ observed sdd was collected between 9 00 and 16 00 beijing time china a 30 cm diameter circular white and black disk on the shady side of the boat helcom 2017 zhang et al 2021c recorded the depth when the disk disappeared from view fee et al 1996 the depth was then taken as the measured value of sdd 2 2 image pre processing fig s2 shows a flowchart of the images pre processing to estimate sdd the high resolution 30 m remote sensing dataset landsat 8 collection 1 operational land imager oli was corrected via the landsat ecosystem disturbance adaptive processing system ledaps and landsat surface reflectance code lasrc schmidt et al 2013 the conversion algorithms of the landsat 8 oli to surface reflectance images require a group of inputs including the outputs of a 6s model run a den total column ozone surface pressure from the national centers for environmental prediction ncep modeled temperature and water vapor kalnay et al 1996 the current study used usgs landsat 8 surface reflectance tier 1 image of all countries retrieved from the google earth engine platform gee gorelick et al 2017 improved by landsat 8 oli tirs sensors to acquire the high quality cloud and shadow free images cfmask provided by gee gorelick et al 2017 was used to check and remove the bad pixels e g cloud shadow and snow covered and screen yearly images by the median filter from 2014 to 2020 six bands b1 coastal aerosol b2 blue b3 green b4 red b5 near infrared b7 shortwave infrared 2 collected in each image were adopted into the proposed model for training by multiplying with 10 000 lake polygons and lake specific characteristics of global lakes were derived from hydrolakes http www hydrosheds org messagser et al 2016 lake specific characteristics included lake area average lake depth average discharge and average residence time of lake water inside the hydrolakes dataset the lake area was fused from multiple data sources i e canvec swbd modis nhd ecrins glwd grand the average depth is defined as the ratio between total lake volume and area the long term 1971 2000 lake average discharge was obtained and downscaled from the globally integrated water model watergap residence time was calculated as the ratio between lake volume and discharge elevation was derived from the earthenv dem90 digital elevation model at 90 m pixel resolution it should be noted that the hydrolakes datasets ensure that the delineated lakes and reservoirs are not rivers and wetlands messager et al 2016 the 30 m high resolution global water occurrence frequency map was derived from the jrc global surface water mapping layers pekel et al 2016 this study retains the original values from landsat 8 surface reflectance images during the ice free season august to october between 2014 and 2020 and assumes an occurrence frequency of 25 in identifying permanent water bodies these images were then clipped by the boundaries of global lakes provided by the lake polygons to distinguish the lake surface from rivers and ponds and finally generate a high resolution annual lake surface reflectance image series 3 methodology 3 1 deep gated recurrent network dgrn architectures traditional anns are feasible for solving non linear problems whereas rnns are effective in predicting long term sequences with embedded grus algorithms alom et al 2019 goodfellow et al 2016 based on the advantages of anns and grus this study aimed to construct a hybrid deep gated recurrent network dgrn model for estimating sdd sequences in global lakes the dgrn model constructed in this study could extract eigenvalues and reserve information by combining full connected layers from anns and grus layers from rnns the basic unit of the dgrn is constructed by two repeated blocks framed by a box with a blue dashed line in fig 1 a each of which stacks 2 gru layers 1 full connected layer and 3 batch normalization bn layers a root mean square prop rmsprop optimization algorithm was used to minimize the loss function which was set to mse with a learning rate of 0 005 the dgrn training followed the earlystopping strategy the detailed algorithms and architectures are described in the following sections 3 1 1 full connected and batch normalization layers full connected layers improve the feature abstraction and combination of the dgrn to extract adequate information of a data sequence each full connected layer was stacked onto two gru layers fig 1 the neurons in the full connected layers were given by the linear regression formula in eq 1 with the input of the previous layer goodfellow et al 2016 1 y f a w x b where fa is the activation function which is set to the rectified linear unit relu in this study w and b denote the weights and bias respectively which were updated in each iteration the bn layer normalizes each feature channel of layers by scaling the data to zero mean and unit variance across mini batches biniz and el ayachi 2021 ioffe and szegedy 2015 the bn layer cannot transform information however it accelerates the training by reducing the internal covariate shift as the model has saturating nonlinearities and a lower learning rate ioffe and szegedy 2015 the bn layers are placed between other layers fig 1a gru and gru layers or gru and full connected layers to improve computational efficiency and achieve better accuracy in this study 3 1 2 gated recurrent unit gru layer the theory of a gated recurrent unit gru was proposed by cho et al 2014 and the gru layer was developed by chung et al 2014 which is similar to the long short term memory unit guan et al 2011 zhou et al 2016 the gru layer is cheaper than the lstm layer in computation because it only has two gating units and can reduce the risks of vanishing exploding gradient ensuring the stability of modeling and capture the information from previous time steps for better model convergence pascanu et al 2012 rehmer and kroll 2020 therefore gru layers are always stacked on top of the dgrn to reserve more information and accelerate the computation the architecture of the gru layer is illustrated in fig 1b the output ht of the gru layer is calculated as 2 h t 1 z t h t 1 z t h t where ht is the linear interpolation between the ht 1 output of gru at time t 1 and candidate activation h t zt denotes an update gate calculated as 3 z t f z w z x t u z h t 1 where the update gate zt is a function of wz xt uz and ht 1 wz and uz represent the weights updated in every iteration xt is the value of a sequence at time t in this study function fz and fr always use a sigmoid function to calculate and fc always use a tanh function he et al 2018 the calculation of candidate activation h t denotes similar to the traditional recurrent unit bahdanau et al 2014 chung et al 2014 4 h t f c w c x t u c r t h t 1 where the candidate activation h t is a function of wc xt uc rt and ht 1 wc and uc are the weights for h t rt is a set of reset gates which is calculated as 5 r t f r w r h t 1 u r x t where the reset gate rt is a tanh function of wr ht 1 ur and xt 3 2 other methods for intercomparison to evaluate the performance of dgrn this study intercompared multiple linear regression lr random forest rf support vector machine svm gaussian process egression gpr anns multilayer perceptron neural network mlpnn and deep residual network resnet to estimate sdd the training and validation processes of the above models were implemented using the scikit learn and keras packages in python https keras io api lr is an empirical model that has been widely applied in modeling sdd across scales liu et al 2020 song et al 2020 zhang et al 2021c a basic lr with the commonly adopted input bands b1 5 and b7 was used in this study as a baseline to assess the accuracy of the dgrn machine learning based models rf svm and gpr have been utilized in both classification and regression problems heckmeier and breitsamter 2020 kisi and cimen 2009 mutanga et al 2012 this study also established an rf model with a mean absolute error mae criterion and 1000 iterations an svm model with a radial basis function rbf kernel and a gpr model with a kernel composed of constantvalue whitekernel rbf dotproduct and rationalquadratic the other deep learning based models in this study included anns mlpnns and resnet which are widely adopted in geoscience chen et al 2020 zhu et al 2019 2020b to improve the model performance the current study ensured optimal machine and deep learning based models by adjusting hyperparameters e g activation function depths learning rate loss function epochs batch size etc to estimate the sdd the specifications of the linear regression machine learning and deep learning models used in this study are listed in table 1 3 3 statistical analysis and accuracy assessment statistical analysis includes the calculation of the statistical indicators e g average maximum and minimum values and trend analysis e g change rate and significance levels the trend analysis of sdd was performed using the mann kendall mk trend test by combining sen s slope şen 2012 and significance levels kendall 1948 mann 1945 which are commonly adopted in diagnosing trends in hydrometeorological records alashan 2020 this study defined significant changes by determining the confidence interval of the p value as 95 the determination coefficient r2 mae root mean square error rmse and mean absolute percentage error mape were used in this study to assess the performance of all sdd models the equations used to calculate these indices were as follows 6 r 2 n i 1 n y i x i i 1 n y i i 1 n x i n i 1 n y i 2 i 1 n y i 2 n i 1 n x i 2 i 1 n x i 2 7 m a e 1 n i 1 n x i y i 8 r m s e 1 n i 1 n x i y i 2 1 n i 1 n x i 9 m a p e 100 n i 1 n x i y i x i where xi and yi are the predicted and observed values at the time i respectively and n denotes the length of the time series for variables x and y in the calculation 4 results 4 1 optical properties of in situ sdd datasets the remote sensing reflectance rrs was calculated by dividing the satellite surface reflectance by π which largely varied in space zhang et al 2021c the spectra of rrs represent the optical absorption and reflectance features of global lakes le et al 2009 the global averages of the remote sensing reflectance of the satellite derived data are 0 0105 0 0122 0 0167 0 0122 0 0141 and 0 006 for b1 b2 b3 b4 b5 and b7 respectively fig 2 a plots the spectral range in the green band which shows that the order of average rrs is as follows b3 green b5 near infrared b4 red b2 blue b1 ultra blue b7 short infrared 2 the magnitude and shape of rrs are similar to the typical spectral characteristics of turbid water lake taihu le et al 2009 rivers in southeast asia wang et al 2013 the rrs value in b2 is relatively low due to the high absorption of water constituents whereas rrs in b3 is higher owing to the weak absorption of suspended sediment and chlorophyll a le et al 2009 wang et al 2013 calculated from all the sampled lakes in situ measured sdd ranged from 0 06 to 13 0 m with an average of 1 84 m which indicates a relatively broad range fig 2b shows the probability density distribution of the in situ sdd which decreases as sdd increases it is noted that more than 40 of the in situ measured sdd are within the range of 0 to 1 m while more than 30 of the in situ measured sdd are within the range of 1 to 2 m 4 2 evaluations of model performance dgrn achieved excellent results as indicated by statistical measures i e r2 mae rmse and mape with testing sets fig 3 around 70 of the in situ measured sdd were used for training the dgrn and a significant linear correlation with the in situ predicted sdd is also found the accuracies were 0 97 for r2 0 2 0 34 and 21 16 for mape fig 3 for the in situ measured sdd 30 were used to validate the dgrn the accuracy achieves 0 84 for r2 0 55 0 83 and 45 13 for mape fig 3 the scattering points are all around a 1 1 baseline without any offsets in the training and testing sets indicating that dgrn could accurately capture the variations of in situ sdd data seven regression and machine and deep learning based methods i e lr rf svm gpr mlpnn ann and resnet were implemented and compared with dgrn in this study figs 3 5 s3 the results indicate that dgrn outperformed mlpnn gpr and other algorithms tested summarized from the evaluation metrics r2 achieves 0 84 for dgrn and ann which are relatively higher than the other algorithms mae is the lowest for dgrn which is about 0 55 rmse achieves the lowest rmse 0 83 for dgrn and ann mape achieves 45 13 for dgrn which is relatively lower among the 8 algorithms the taylor diagram fig 5 provides an integrated evaluation of model performance in which dgrn demonstrates the optimal accuracy the closest to 0 indicating that dgrn could improve the performance of sdd by stacking gru and a full connected layer and memorizing additional temporal features gpr and ann performed similarly to dgrn while lr performed the worst in this problem suggesting that adding more full connected layers and adopting more complex architectures could improve the model accuracy 4 3 spatial distribution pattern of global lakes sdd the global lake average of sdd in 16 475 lakes area 10 km2 was mapped with landsat 8 images based on dgrn during 2014 and 2020 fig 6 the results show that the lake sdd ranges from 0 m to 9 51 m with a mean value of 1 88 1 24 m it is obvious that sdd increases as the latitude increases from 40 to 60 fig 6b suggesting a significant latitudinal zonality which is similar to the global pattern of lake temperature maberly et al 2020 and lake specific depth fig s8 considering the response of water clarity to climate change pilla et al 2018 pointed out that an increase in lake temperature may cause a subsequent increase in dissolved organic matter which eventually decreases the water clarity in many lakes in high latitude lakes 70 n sdd is in the 0 01 6 70 m range with a mean value of 1 49 1 19 m in mid high latitude lakes 45 n 70 n lake average sdd is 2 17 1 09 m and ranges from 0 01 to 8 33 m in mid latitude lakes 25 n 45 n sdd reflects lower water clarity with a mean value of 1 53 1 43 m and in the range of 0 002 m and 9 51 m in low latitude lakes 0 25 n the sdd of lakes ranges from 0 0004 to 6 01 m with an average of 0 99 0 86 m in the southern hemisphere lakes are mainly distributed between 60 s and 0 lakes in the range of 60 s and 40 s exhibit higher sdd with an average of 3 22 1 90 m a maximum of 8 96 m and a minimum of 0 006 m between 40 s and 0 the lake average of sdd is relatively low with an average of 0 94 0 97 m and a range of 0 009 m and 6 69 m in summary the dgrn derived lake average of sdd in 75 of lakes ranged from 0 to 3 m and sdd in about 15 of lakes are within the range of 3 4 m fig 6d the spatial distribution of the global lakes sdd for each year from 2014 to 2020 is depicted in fig 7 the average value of the global lakes sdd for each year is 1 89 1 41 m 2014 1 92 1 41 m 2015 1 93 1 39 m 2016 1 84 1 39 m 2017 1 64 1 35 m 2018 1 86 1 42 m 2019 and 1 91 1 42 m 2020 the sdd in high latitude lakes indicates higher water clarity and standard deviation s d fig s3 specifically spatial distributions of global lakes sdd in north america and northwestern europe show that sdd in 2018 was relatively lower than that in other years fig 7 it is worth noting that the lake average sdd in 2018 was significantly lower than other studied years for the lakes with insignificant trends fig 8 b especially in northern canda fig 7 and it started to rise up from 2019 the dgrn model also successfully predicted the spatial variations of sdd for individual lakes for example sdd in lake qinghai lake chiquita lake chaohu and lake taihu were selected for validation figs s4 5 the results of which are consistent with previous studies liu et al 2021 mccullough et al 2013 pilati et al 2016 in addition the spatial distribution of s d fig s6 depicts those regions with relatively higher s d value such as in north america northeast europe and the qinghai tibet plateau show a similar spatial pattern of global lakes sdd fig 6a suggesting that lakes with higher water clarity are likely to be influenced by external factors the magnitude of the variations in lake sdd can be further revealed via the coefficient of variation cv which is shown in fig s7 lakes with large cv i e 0 3 are mostly located in the southern hemisphere and low latitude regions such as the central us and southern asia which may be related to the intense anthropogenic disturbance to those regions wang et al 2021 4 4 trend analysis of global lakes sdd the temporal trend of global lakes sdd shows weak declining water clarity slope 0 013 m y from 2014 to 2020 through the mk trend test figs 8 9 among these lakes 15 840 indicate insignificant stable or variable sdd trends slope 0 013 m y 392 indicate declining sdd trends slope 0 205 m y and 243 lakes indicate increasing sdd trends slope 0 182 m y the trend test of the global lakes sdd shows that lakes with positive change rates are mainly distributed in the regions with high clarity such as north america europe eastern russian and qinghai tibet plateau fig 8 however lakes with negative change rates of sdd were also widely distributed in these regions fig 8 for example the difference of the number between lakes with increasing trend and decreasing trend ndif between 75 and 76 w is the largest ndif 142 over all the other regions where most of the lakes in the mid high latitude 40 n 80 n are dominated by decreasing change rates fig 10 b c these findings imply that global lakes are mostly experiencing decreasing water clarity in general especially those with high water clarity fig 9 shows the temporal changes in global lakes sdd between 2014 and 2020 global lakes were classified into four groups all significantly increased significantly decreased and insignificant two periods of sdd changes are clearly detected in fig 9 between 2014 and 2018 global lakes sdd decrease gradually fig 9a the sdd of lakes with an insignificant trend reflects the similar pattern fig 9d while the sdd of lakes with significant trends showed stable changes fig 9b c in addition sdd in lakes with an insignificant trend fig 9d showed a continuous increase between 2018 and 2020 fig 9d furthermore five groups of lakes were categorized with different sdd values as shown in fig 9 sdd 2 m 2 4 m 4 6 m 6 8 m and 8 m the changes in the number of global lakes can be divided into several periods between 2014 and 2018 the number of lakes with an sdd 2 m rapidly increased followed by a continuous decrease between 2018 and 2020 the number of lakes with an sdd of 2 4 m showed a negative change with an sdd of less than 2 m the number of lakes with an sdd of 6 8 m or more than 8 m shows an increasing trend between 2014 and 2020 with slopes of 3 536 and 1 643 respectively the number of lakes with an sdd of 4 6 m slope 8 306 decreased until 2015 followed by an unceasing increase between 2015 and 2017 then suddenly increased in 2018 and recovered between 2019 and 2020 the number of low and middle clarity sdd 4 m lakes is changing dramatically while that of high clarity 4 m is increasing gradually 5 discussion 5 1 cons and pros of the dgrn model and future improvement dgrn is a deep learning based model which was developed based on the relationship between in situ sdd and six bands of landsat 8 surface reflectance images different from anns and mlpnns the former two full connected layers of blocks in the dgrn model could separate the model input for each batch into more features equal to the width then the outputs for each block can be derived from the sequence information by passing the gru layers thus the dgrn model could fully capture the sequence information for each batch of training sets by stacking a gru layer and a full connected layer bridging a more efficient and robust way connecting surface reflectance and water clarity and overcoming the limitations of traditional anns and mlpnns in contrast to the deep learning based model spectra based empirical models are commonly applied to construct the relationship between bands of satellite images and sdd according to previous studies and the performance of these models allan et al 2011 allee and johnson 1999 cozar et al 2005 dona et al 2014 doron et al 2011 duan et al 2009 guan et al 2011 harma et al 2001 mancino et al 2009 mccullough et al 2013 olmanson et al 2011 zhang et al 2021c were inter compared in this study table 2 in summary the model was constructed based on the blue green red and nir bands of landsat images such as the single band models allan et al 2011 allee and johnson 1999 dona et al 2014 mccullough et al 2013 zhang et al 2021c exponential models dona et al 2014 zhang et al 2021c and band ratio models doron et al 2011 duan et al 2009 guan et al 2011 harma et al 2001 mancino et al 2009 olmanson et al 2011 the above mentioned models exhibited excellent performance in the study areas thus we compared the above spectra based empirical models with dgrn using in situ datasets in this study the results demonstrated that dgrn has higher accuracy in terms of r2 while the accuracy of the band ratio model based on multiple bands is far better than that of other empirical models table 2 additionally an obvious advantage is that the model can be easily implemented into other earth resources and ocean color satellites e g sentinel 2 gao fen series etc specifically the next generation of landsat series dataset landsat 9 to derive spatial temporal sdd patterns in global lakes the current limitations of the dgrn model are mainly constrained by image processing and in situ measured data first it is difficult to acquire high quality cloud ice and snow free surface reflectance images the large variability in total ice duration causes uncertainty in estimating the duration of the snow ice free period in high latitude and high altitude lake ecosystems due to continued global warming cai et al 2019 pilla and williamson 2022 woolway et al 2020 for example the ice cover duration of lakes in north america often ranges from 0 to 300 days pilla and williamson 2022 while in the qinghai tibet plateau it is approximately 157 78 days cai et al 2019 because of the drastic changes in the ice cover duration some studies screened high quality remote sensing images from june to october as the ice free season in china zhang et al 2021c to avoid the high reflectance from snow and ice and ensure adequate images this study selected the snow ice free season august to october during 2014 and 2020 as a stopgap measure to estimate the annual lake average of sdd nevertheless an accurate evaluation of the total ice duration for each lake should be considered to acquire more precise images in the future secondly it is challenging for remote sensing to classify shallow and deep waters removing the contribution of bottom reflectance spectra doron et al 2011 zhang et al 2021c the bottom reflectance of deep and clear waters contributes significantly to the surface reflectance spectra of remote sensing and underestimates the actual sdd the in situ samples collected in this study were measured in the lakes where the optical depth was lower than the maximum water depth to avoid the influence of the bottom reflectance however the reflectance from the lake bottom inevitably causes uncertainty and errors in some optically deep lakes zhang et al 2021c 5 2 the attribution of lake specific characteristics to the global distribution pattern of sdd in this study six lake specific characteristics that is area discharge depth residence time elevation and the ratio of area and depth area depth were derived from the hydrolakes datasets https www hydrosheds org page hydrolakes to diagnose their impacts on the lake average of sdd fig 10a m as shown in fig 10 the lake specific characteristics were ln transformed for example sdd tends to be stable with lake area fig 10b and it increases gradually in lakes with increasing lake depth fig 10f however lake sdd first increased with elevation discharge and residence time and then started to decrease fig 10d j h these results are consistent with previous studies suggesting that sdd increases with elevation or depth and tends to be stable with the increased area liu et al 2020 loria et al 2020 olmanson et al 2014 the contrasting trends in the changes in sdd are driven by the comprehensive influence of climate change and anthropogenic activities that support the turbidity of each lake the lake specific area depth is mainly distributed between 200 and 100 000 km and higher lake specific area depth is attributed to the higher lake specific area or lower depth demonstrating that these lakes are more susceptible to anthropogenic activities and climate change sdd increases as the area depth increases from 0 to 200 km and then sdd starts to decrease when area depth increases from 200 to 20 000 km suggesting that area depth around 200 km is a threshold for maintaining lake clarity feature importance fi algorithms provided by random forest were employed to estimate the contribution to the sdd of lake specific characteristics fig 10m demonstrates that the order of the characteristic contributions as follows depth fi 0 31 elevation fi 0 20 residence time fi 0 15 discharge fi 0 13 area depth fi 0 11 and area fi 0 10 according to a previous study comprising global 573 lakes qin et al 2020 the concentration of nutrients decreases with lake depth which causes eutrophication and algal blooms occurring mostly in shallow lakes leading to an improvement in water clarity on the other hand lake specific depth determines the effects of wind on water clarity reardon et al 2014 wind induced sediment resuspension affects water clarity in shallow lakes by stimulating the wave momentum and reflecting on the resuspension of bed particles in the water column however it is difficult to occur in deep waters because of the steady mixing regimes dai et al 2018 kraemer et al 2020 reardon et al 2014 woolway and merchant 2019 therefore it is inevitable that lake specific depth is the most influential factor in sdd and its latitudinal zonality 5 3 water clarity change during covid 19 in 2019 the coronavirus pandemic covid 19 outbroke worldwide mizumoto et al 2020 zhu et al 2019 causing many unprecedented sufferings yang et al 2021 people around the world had to adopt various restriction measures such as lockdown orders to reduce the risks of infection tian et al 2020 therefore the intensity of anthropogenic activities has slowed down nearly all over the world yang et al 2021 resulting in the improvement of water clarity found in recent studies in lagoons rivers lakes callejas et al 2021 liu et al 2022 yunus et al 2020 during the lockdown period social and industrial activities i e industrial discharges and public interactions were restrained for several weeks yunus et al 2020 then air quality was significantly increased yang et al 2021 which might subsequently reduce atmospheric deposition industrial sewage discharges and railway transport passenger volume resulting in a declination in total suspended solids concentration and sediment resuspension in aquatic ecosystems callejas et al 2021 liu et al 2022 xu et al 2021 and in turn increased water clarity in terms of sdd li et al 2020 shi et al 2018 it is interesting to see that this hypothesis is supported by the results of the current study the global distribution of normalized difference of sdd nd fig 11 which is defined as n d l a k e 100 s d d 2020 l a k e s d d n l a k e s d d m e a n l a k e n represents the sdd in 2019 or the average during 2014 and 2019 suggesting that sdd in 2020 is relatively higher than that during 2014 and 2020 as shown by the contrast between fig 11a and b the dramatic improvement of nd in 2020 with an average of 11 37 fig 11a or 6 41 fig 11b emphasizes that the water clarity increased during the lockdown period due to covid 19 from a global perspective the changes in global lake nd indicate a latitude zonality due to different restrictions and intervention measures in different regions kraemer et al 2020 shadmi et al 2020 and suggest a positive and dramatic change in sdd as latitude increases for instance nd in southern china which has been experiencing long term anthropogenic activities yu et al 2021 has positively been changed under rigorous restriction measures and the reduction of pollutant discharges kraemer et al 2020 liu et al 2022 especially in hubei province fig 11c d the changes in lake nd in brazil and australia fig 11a b showed insignificant tendencies during covid 19 under the generous measures shadmi et al 2020 to trace the flow of sdd changes and anomalies in global lakes during covid 19 fig 12 uses sankey diagrams to depict how sdd and its anomalies varied between 2019 and 2020 on a global scale changes in sdd and their anomalies were divided into five groups 2 m 2 4 m 4 6 m 6 8 m 8 m and 0 m 0 0 5 m 0 5 1 m 1 2 m and 2 m fig 12a shows that sdd in 11 855 lakes 72 0 did not change to the different groups whereas sdd increased in 2446 lakes 14 8 and decreased in 2174 lakes 13 2 between 2019 and 2020 according to fig 12b sdd anomalies in a large number of lakes 6249 37 9 remained stable with 5707 lakes 34 7 showing positive trends while 4519 lakes 27 4 showed negative trends figs 11 12 demonstrate that increased water clarity was found in most global lakes during covid 19 which could be the result of reduced anthropogenic activities after rigorous restrictive measures and lockdowns shadmi et al 2020 during the long term decreasing trends of water clarity figs 8 9 the reduction of anthropogenic activities would help lakes recover the water clarity in general and save the environment of the aquatic ecosystem except for natural high clarity lakes 6 conclusion this study proposed a novel deep learning based model to estimate the secchi disk depth sdd of global lakes using landsat 8 oli surface reflectance images in the ice free season from 2014 to 2020 we found that 1 the deep gated recurrent network dgrn model trained with 70 of the in situ sdd data and surface reflectance of images exhibited superior performance r2 0 84 mae 0 55 rmse 0 83 mape 45 13 by intercomparing the results with other 7 regression or machine deep learning models 2 the dgrn model was capable of estimating sdd in global lakes area 10 km2 and identified the spatial distribution of the lake average sdd the average dgrn predicted sdd is 1 88 1 24 m with an obvious latitude zonality the sdd and standard deviation of the lakes in canada europe and the qinghai tibet plateau were higher than those in the other regions showing that these lakes were likely to be influenced by external factors 3 the dgrn model retrieved the temporal trends of sdd in 16 475 lakes from 2014 to 2020 an insignificant negative trend slope 0 013 m y of sdd was observed in all the lakes the lake average of the 243 lakes sdd significantly increased at a rate of 0 182 m y p 0 05 while the sdd of the 392 lakes showed a significant decrease at a rate of 0 205 m y p 0 05 among these lakes the overall decreasing trend can be further described by the increasing number of lakes with a low sdd i e less than 2 m and a decreasing number of lakes with an sdd of 2 4 m 4 the spatial difference of global lakes sdd was successfully estimated by the dgrn model which suggested an increasing trend of sdd during the covid 19 pandemic sdd was also found to be closely related to lake specific characteristics especially lake specific depth considering further model improvement the acquisition of high quality images in various snow ice free seasons with the removal of the lake bottom reflectance was limited by the understanding of the optical process in global lakes indicating that the proposed dgrn would require higher quality images to estimate sdd accurately declaration of competing interest all authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

16150,information regarding water clarity at large spatiotemporal scales is critical for understanding comprehensive changes in the water quality and status of ecosystems previous studies have suggested that satellite observation is an effective means of obtaining such information however a reliable model for accurately mapping the water clarity of global lakes reservoirs is still lacking due to the high optical complexity of lake waters in this study by using gated recurrent units gru layers instead of full connected layers from artificial neural networks anns to capture the efficient sequence information of in situ datasets we propose a novel and transferrable hybrid deep learning based recurrent model dgrn to map the water clarity of global lakes with landsat 8 operational land imager oli images we trained and further validated the model using 1260 pairs of in situ measured water clarity and surface reflectance of landsat 8 oli images with google earth engine the model was subsequently utilized to construct the global pattern of temporal and spatial changes in water clarity lake area 10 km2 from 2014 to 2020 the results show that the model can estimate water clarity with good performance r2 0 84 mae 0 55 rmse 0 83 mape 45 13 the multi year average of water clarity for global lakes 16 475 lakes ranged from 0 0004 to 9 51 m with an average value of 1 88 1 24 m compared to the lake area elevation discharge residence time and the ratio of area to depth water depth was the most important factor that determined the global spatial distribution pattern of water clarity water clarity of 15 840 global lakes between 2014 and 2020 remained stable p 0 05 while there was a significant increase in 243 lakes p 0 05 and a decrease in 392 lakes p 0 05 however water clarity in 2020 covid 19 period showed a significant increase in most global lakes especially in china and canada suggesting that the worldwide lockdown strategy due to covid 19 might have improved water quality espically water clarity dueto the apparent reduction of anthropogenic activities graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords water clarity secchi disk depth deep learning landsat global lakes 1 introduction lakes reservoirs are essential components of the terrestrial aquatic system which occupy 3 7 of the earth s nonglaciated land area verpoorter et al 2014 as well as providing freshwater resources that support agricultural and industrial activities and regulating the regional climate change pekel et al 2016 visser et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 in recent years an increasing number of lakes are threatened by cyanobacterial blooms and extreme events due to the pronounced global warming leading to the grave threat on public health and aquatic ecosystem as a result of severe water quality crisis and degraded ecosystem services hou et al 2022 huisman et al 2018 woolway et al 2021 water clarity or water transparency expressed by the secchi disk depth sdd reflects the underwater light field and primary productivity of the aquatic system fee et al 1996 feng et al 2019 li et al 2020 providing synthetic information on lake quality and ecosystem status wang et al 2020 generally sdd is determined by a series of ecological and biogeochemical parameters in lakes such as chlorophyll a aquatic vegetation total suspended matter chromophoric dissolved organic matter particulate carbon and trophic status brezonik et al 2019 pham et al 2020 making it susceptible to external disturbance therefore sdd is a used as the most important indicators for assessing the status and the response of lakes to climate change and anthropogenic activities zhang et al 2021b 2014 lake sdd is sensitive to climate change and anthropogenic activities pekel et al 2016 wu et al 2009 zhang et al 2021c in light of the response of climate conditions to sdd lower concentrations of co2 were found to result in an increasing trend of sdd in small canadian shield lakes fee et al 1996 zhang et al 2014 revealed a significant positive correlation between air temperature and sdd in lake qiandaohu from 1987 to 2012 in the following studies zhang et al 2021c also indicated that warming and wetting conditions improve lake sdd by promoting the growth of vegetation melting of glaciers or expanding the lake area in inner mongolia in addition water clarity is also affected by anthropogenic activities such as chemical fertilizer use and wastewater discharge feng et al 2019 zhang et al 2021b feng et al 2019 quantitatively estimated and concluded that anthropogenic activities accounted for 50 of the large lake sdd in the yangtze plain furthermore the combined effects of air temperature rainfall cropland and industrial sewage accounted for 63 of the variation in sdd in the xin anjiang reservoir li et al 2020 recently the coronavirus pandemic covid 19 has constrained anthropogenic activities globally callejas et al 2021 tian et al 2020 yang et al 2021 which may result in an improvement of water clarity in lagoons callejas et al 2021 extensive studies on lake clarity have been conducted most of which however only focused on the spatiotemporal patterns of sdd in individual lakes or at the regional scale the trend and evolution of lake water clarity at the global scale remain unclear owing to the lack of high quality data and effective algorithms with high temporal and spatial coverage remote sensing has been widely used to derive sdd changes in inland waters using various inversion approaches the inversion approaches of sdd based on remote sensing images can be classified into the following three groups empirical models song et al 2022 zhang et al 2021c semi analytical models lee et al 2002 or analytical models preisendorfer 1986 empirical models rely on simple regressions between observation sdd and multiple bands of surface reflectance from satellites yentsch 1984 however it is subject to accuracy and requires plentiful mathch up in situ measurements lee et al 2016 song et al 2022 classic analytical modesls followed radiative treansfer theory preisendorfer 1986 however this theory could not explain the reaction mechanism of the human eye to the secchi disk which would be replaced by semi analytical algorithms lee et al 2015 semi analytical models for sdd such as the quasi analytical algorithm qaa are based on the solutions of radiative transfer equations le et al 2009 lee et al 2002 loisel and stramski 2000 which can achieve higher accuracy in many cases jiang et al 2019 lee et al 2016 zhan et al 2021 unfortunately it is difficult to apply the semi analytical to larger scales as the relationship between sdd and model parameters is not universal rodrigues et al 2017 recent studies have indicated that single or multi spectral empirical models can be applied to estimate sdd from lake scale li et al 2020 shi et al 2018 to regional olmanson et al 2008 ren et al 2018 national scales liu et al 2020 song et al 2020 zhang et al 2021c and global scale song et al 2022 however inadequate samples for capturing complex optical properties and simplified mechanistic descriptions of lake water inhibits the applications of such models on a large scale therefore an accurate efficient and transferrable algorithm for mapping global sdd is a prerequisite for analyzing trends and patterns of lake clarity change with the development of deep learning methods and in situ datasets instead of simple regression methods data driven approaches including artificial neural networks anns and recurrent neural networks rnns have become popular for estimating lake properties wen et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 zhu et al 2020a anns have a high potential for modeling non linear and complex natural systems huang et al 2015 panda et al 2010 reflecting variations in lake properties for example huang et al 2015 predicted the phytoplankton biomass of lake poyang using a single layer ann antonopoulos et al 2016 predicted daily evaporation using multiple ann structures in lake vegoritis pan et al 2016 embedded anns instead of process based models modflow to a genetic algorithm and achieved higher accuracy in predicting the surface and groundwater of the lake system rnns such as long short term memory networks lstms and gated recurrent units networks grus perform better at training and predicting sequence data because they can capture information from sequences zhang et al 2021a wen et al 2019 predicted water level variation in lake dongtinghu based on lstms zhang et al 2021a compared anns lstms and grus in predicting daily runoff in the muskegon and pearl rivers and demonstrated that rnns i e lstms and grus perform better than anns deep learning algorithms are powerful tools of depicting the changes of sdd at global scale however anns ignore the information of the sequence leading to the large uncertainty of temporal reconstruction in contrast rnns are better options for sequence information processing while are at risk of vanishing exploding gradients alom et al 2019 pascanu et al 2012 therefore to estimate water clarity precisely this study integrates anns and rnns in a robust way to map sdd at the global scale which not only includes the information of in situ measurements sequence but also overcomes the limitation of vanishing exploding gradients it is critical to develop a rigorously validated and efficient algorithm for mapping global sdd for an improved understanding of the spatiotemporal patterns of global lakes clarity under disturbance we thus hypothesized that 1 a deep learning based and globally adopted algorithm for mapping sdd would help diagnosing diverse trends and patterns of lake water clarity and 2 the global lake clarity changes were mainly influenced by lake specific characteristics and anthropogenic activities the innovation of this study is to acquire an accurate global dataset of sdd via a novel hybrid deep learning based model based on landsat 8 surface reflectance images and in situ measurements across time and space specific objectives are to 1 propose and develop a deep learning based inversion model at a global scale from 16 475 lakes area 10 km2 using in situ measured sdd data 2 apply to estimate the spatiotemporal pattern of global lakes sdd from 2014 to 2020 3 explore the attribution of lake specific characteristics to sdd and the spatial variability of global lakes sdd during the covid 19 pandemic in global lakes 2 data 2 1 in situ measured data we collected 1293 pairs of surface reflectance and in situ observed sdd fig s1 80 n 1034 of the samples were used for training and 20 n 259 for testing the in situ measured data were collected from field campaigns in 399 lakes across china america and europe specific information of those lakes are summarized in table s1 the 16 day repeated coverage period of the landsat 8 satellite inhibits collecting sufficient in situ measurements within a short interval nevertheless sampling within a seven day interval is a reasonable way of ensuring high performance as suggested in zhang et al 2021c it also provided sufficient match ups that were currently adopted for water clarity modeling at a large scale hou et al 2022 liu et al 2020 hence for both accuracy and efficiency the in situ measured surface reflectance acquired landsat surface reflectance images within a seven day interval to eliminate the uncertainty of sunlight in situ observed sdd was collected between 9 00 and 16 00 beijing time china a 30 cm diameter circular white and black disk on the shady side of the boat helcom 2017 zhang et al 2021c recorded the depth when the disk disappeared from view fee et al 1996 the depth was then taken as the measured value of sdd 2 2 image pre processing fig s2 shows a flowchart of the images pre processing to estimate sdd the high resolution 30 m remote sensing dataset landsat 8 collection 1 operational land imager oli was corrected via the landsat ecosystem disturbance adaptive processing system ledaps and landsat surface reflectance code lasrc schmidt et al 2013 the conversion algorithms of the landsat 8 oli to surface reflectance

water vapor kalnay et al 1996 the current study used usgs landsat 8 surface reflectance tier 1 image of all countries retrieved from the google earth engine platform gee gorelick et al 2017 improved

adopted into the proposed model for training by multiplying with 10 000 lake polygons and lake specific characteristics of global lakes were derived from hydrolakes http www hydrosheds org messagser et al 2016 lake specific characteristics included lake area average lake depth average discharge and average residence time of lake water inside the hydrolakes dataset the lake area was fused from multiple data sources i e canvec swbd modis nhd ecrins glwd grand the average depth is defined as the ratio between total lake volume and area the long term 1971 2000 lake average discharge was obtained and downscaled from the globally integrated water model watergap residence time was calculated as the ratio between lake volume and discharge elevation was derived from the earthenv dem90 digital elevation model at 90 m pixel resolution it should be noted that the hydrolakes datasets ensure that the delineated lakes and reservoirs are not rivers and wetlands messager et al 2016 the 30 m high resolution global water occurrence frequency map was derived from the jrc global surface water mapping layers pekel et al 2016 this study retains the original values from landsat 8 surface reflectance images during the ice free season august to october between 2014 and 2020 and assumes an occurrence frequency of 25 in identifying permanent water bodies these images were then clipped by the boundaries of global lakes provided by the lake polygons to distinguish the lake surface from rivers and ponds and finally generate a high resolution annual lake surface reflectance image series 3 methodology 3 1 deep gated recurrent network dgrn architectures traditional anns are feasible for solving non linear problems whereas rnns are effective in predicting long term sequences with embedded grus algorithms alom et al 2019 goodfellow et al 2016 based on the advantages of anns and grus this study aimed to construct a hybrid deep gated recurrent network dgrn model for estimating sdd sequences in global lakes the dgrn model constructed in this study could extract eigenvalues and reserve information by combining full connected layers from anns and grus layers from rnns the basic unit of the dgrn is constructed by two repeated blocks framed by a box with a blue dashed line in fig 1 a each of which stacks 2 gru layers 1 full connected layer and 3 batch normalization bn layers a root mean square prop rmsprop optimization algorithm was used to minimize the loss function which was set to mse with a learning rate of 0 005 the dgrn training followed the earlystopping strategy the detailed algorithms and architectures are described in the following sections 3 1 1 full connected and batch normalization layers full connected layers improve the feature abstraction and combination of the dgrn to extract adequate information of a data sequence each full connected layer was stacked onto two gru layers fig 1 the neurons in the full connected layers were given by the linear regression formula in eq 1 with the input of the previous layer goodfellow et al 2016 1 y f a w x b where fa is the activation function which is set to the rectified linear unit relu in this study w and b denote the weights and bias respectively which were updated in each iteration the bn layer normalizes each feature channel of layers by scaling the data to zero mean and unit variance across mini batches biniz and el ayachi 2021 ioffe and szegedy 2015 the bn layer cannot transform information however it accelerates the training by reducing the internal covariate shift as the model has saturating nonlinearities and a lower learning rate ioffe and szegedy 2015 the bn layers are placed between other layers fig 1a gru and gru layers or gru and full connected layers to improve computational efficiency and achieve better accuracy in this study 3 1 2 gated recurrent unit gru layer the theory of a gated recurrent unit gru was proposed by cho et al 2014 and the gru layer was developed by chung et al 2014 which is similar to the long short term memory unit guan et al 2011 zhou et al 2016 the gru layer is cheaper than the lstm layer in computation because it only has two gating units and can reduce the risks of vanishing exploding gradient ensuring the stability of modeling and capture the information from previous time steps for better model convergence pascanu et al 2012 rehmer and kroll 2020 therefore gru layers are always stacked on top of the dgrn to reserve more information and accelerate the computation the architecture of the gru layer is illustrated in fig 1b the output ht of the gru layer is calculated as 2 h t 1 z t h t 1 z t h t where ht is the linear interpolation between the ht 1 output of gru at time t 1 and candidate activation h t zt denotes an update gate calculated as 3 z t f z w z x t u z h t 1 where the update gate zt is a function of wz xt uz and ht 1 wz and uz represent the weights updated in every iteration xt is the value of a sequence at time t in this study function fz and fr always use a sigmoid function to calculate and fc always use a tanh function he et al 2018 the calculation of candidate activation h t denotes similar to the traditional recurrent unit bahdanau et al 2014 chung et al 2014 4 h t f c w c x t u c r t h t 1 where the candidate activation h t is a function of wc xt uc rt and ht 1 wc and uc are the weights for h t rt is a set of reset gates which is calculated as 5 r t f r w r h t 1 u r x t where the reset gate rt is a tanh function of wr ht 1 ur and xt 3 2 other methods for intercomparison to evaluate the performance of dgrn this study intercompared multiple linear regression lr random forest rf support vector machine svm gaussian process egression gpr anns multilayer perceptron neural network mlpnn and deep residual network resnet to estimate sdd the training and validation processes of the above models were implemented using the scikit learn and keras packages in python https keras io api lr is an empirical model that has been widely applied in modeling sdd across scales liu et al 2020 song et al 2020 zhang et al 2021c a basic lr with the commonly adopted input bands b1 5 and b7 was used in this study as a baseline to assess the accuracy of the dgrn machine learning based models rf svm and gpr have been utilized in both classification and regression problems heckmeier and breitsamter 2020 kisi and cimen 2009 mutanga et al 2012 this study also established an rf model with a mean absolute error mae criterion and 1000 iterations an svm model with a radial basis function rbf kernel and a gpr model with a kernel composed of constantvalue whitekernel rbf dotproduct and rationalquadratic the other deep learning based models in this study included anns mlpnns and resnet which are widely adopted in geoscience chen et al 2020 zhu et al 2019 2020b to improve the model performance the current study ensured optimal machine and deep learning based models by adjusting hyperparameters e g activation function depths learning rate loss function epochs batch size etc to estimate the sdd the specifications of the linear regression machine learning and deep learning models used in this study are listed in table 1 3 3 statistical analysis and accuracy assessment statistical analysis includes the calculation of the statistical indicators e g average maximum and minimum values and trend analysis e g change rate and significance levels the trend analysis of sdd was performed using the mann kendall mk trend test by combining sen s slope şen 2012 and significance levels kendall 1948 mann 1945 which are commonly adopted in diagnosing trends in hydrometeorological records alashan 2020 this study defined significant changes by determining the confidence interval of the p value as 95 the determination coefficient r2 mae root mean square error rmse and mean absolute percentage error mape were used in this study to assess the performance of all sdd models the equations used to calculate these indices were as follows 6 r 2 n i 1 n y i x i i 1 n y i i 1 n x i n i 1 n y i 2 i 1 n y i 2 n i 1 n x i 2 i 1 n x i 2 7 m a e 1 n i 1 n x i y i 8 r

for variables x and y in the calculation 4 results 4 1 optical properties of in situ sdd datasets the remote sensing reflectance rrs was calculated by dividing the satellite surface reflectance by π which largely varied in space zhang et al 2021c the spectra of rrs represent the optical absorption and reflectance features of global lakes le et al 2009 the global averages of the remote sensing reflectance of the satellite derived data are 0 0105 0 0122 0 0167 0 0122 0 0141 and 0 006 for b1 b2 b3 b4 b5 and b7 respectively fig 2 a plots the spectral range in the green band which shows that the order of average rrs is as follows b3 green b5 near infrared b4 red b2 blue b1 ultra blue b7 short infrared 2 the magnitude and shape of rrs are similar to the typical spectral characteristics of turbid water lake taihu le et al 2009 rivers in southeast asia wang et al 2013 the rrs value in b2 is relatively low due to the high absorption of water constituents whereas rrs in b3 is higher owing to the weak absorption of suspended sediment and chlorophyll a le et al 2009 wang et al 2013 calculated from all the sampled lakes in situ measured sdd ranged from 0 06 to 13 0 m with an average of 1 84 m which indicates a relatively broad range fig 2b shows the probability density distribution of the in situ sdd which decreases as sdd increases it is noted that more than 40 of the in situ measured sdd are within the range of 0 to 1 m while more than 30 of the in situ measured sdd are within the range of 1 to 2 m 4 2 evaluations of model performance dgrn achieved excellent results as indicated by statistical measures i e r2 mae rmse and mape with testing sets fig 3 around 70 of the in situ measured sdd were used for training the dgrn and a significant linear correlation with the in situ predicted sdd is also found the accuracies were 0 97 for r2 0 2 0 34 and 21 16 for mape fig 3 for the in situ measured sdd 30 were used to validate the dgrn the accuracy achieves 0 84 for r2 0 55 0 83 and 45 13 for mape fig 3 the scattering points are all around a 1 1 baseline without any offsets in the training and testing sets indicating that dgrn could accurately capture the variations of in situ sdd data seven regression and machine and deep learning based methods i e lr rf svm gpr mlpnn ann and resnet were implemented and compared with dgrn in this study figs 3 5 s3 the results indicate that dgrn outperformed mlpnn gpr and other algorithms tested summarized from the evaluation metrics r2 achieves 0 84 for dgrn and ann which are relatively higher than the other algorithms mae is the lowest for dgrn which is about 0 55 rmse achieves the lowest rmse 0 83 for dgrn and ann mape achieves 45 13 for dgrn which is relatively lower among the 8 algorithms the taylor diagram fig 5 provides an integrated evaluation of model performance in which dgrn demonstrates the optimal accuracy the closest to 0 indicating that dgrn could improve the performance of sdd by stacking gru and a full connected layer and memorizing additional temporal features gpr and ann performed similarly to dgrn while lr performed the worst in this problem suggesting that adding more full connected layers and adopting more complex architectures could improve the model accuracy 4 3 spatial distribution pattern of global lakes sdd the global lake average of sdd in 16 475 lakes area 10 km2 was mapped with landsat 8 images based on dgrn during 2014 and 2020 fig 6 the results show that the lake sdd ranges from 0 m to 9 51 m with a mean value of 1 88 1 24 m it is obvious that sdd increases as the latitude increases from 40 to 60 fig 6b suggesting a significant latitudinal zonality which is similar to the global pattern of lake temperature maberly et al 2020 and lake specific depth fig s8 considering the response of water clarity to climate change pilla et al 2018 pointed out that an increase in lake temperature may cause a subsequent increase in dissolved organic matter which eventually decreases the water clarity in many lakes in high latitude lakes 70 n sdd is in the 0 01 6 70 m range with a mean value of 1 49 1 19 m in mid high latitude lakes 45 n 70 n lake average sdd is 2 17 1 09 m and ranges from 0 01 to 8 33 m in mid latitude lakes 25 n 45 n sdd reflects lower water clarity with a mean value of 1 53 1 43 m and in the range of 0 002 m and 9 51 m in low latitude lakes 0 25 n the sdd of lakes ranges from 0 0004 to 6 01 m with an average of 0 99 0 86 m in the southern hemisphere lakes are mainly distributed between 60 s and 0 lakes in the range of 60 s and 40 s exhibit higher sdd with an average of 3 22 1 90 m a maximum of 8 96 m and a minimum of 0 006 m between 40 s and 0 the lake average of sdd is relatively low with an average of 0 94 0 97 m and a range of 0 009 m and 6 69 m in summary the dgrn derived lake average of sdd in 75 of lakes ranged from 0 to 3 m and sdd in about 15 of lakes are within the range of 3 4 m fig 6d the spatial distribution of the global lakes sdd for each year from 2014 to 2020 is depicted in fig 7 the average value of the global lakes sdd for each year is 1 89 1 41 m 2014 1 92 1 41 m 2015 1 93 1 39 m 2016 1 84 1 39 m 2017 1 64 1 35 m 2018 1 86 1 42 m 2019 and 1 91 1 42 m 2020 the sdd in high latitude lakes indicates higher water clarity and standard deviation s d fig s3 specifically spatial distributions of global lakes sdd in north america and northwestern europe show that sdd in 2018 was relatively lower than that in other years fig 7 it is worth noting that the lake average sdd in 2018 was significantly lower than other studied years for the lakes with insignificant trends fig 8 b especially in northern canda fig 7 and it started to rise up from 2019 the dgrn model also successfully predicted the spatial variations of sdd for individual lakes for example sdd in lake qinghai lake chiquita lake chaohu and lake taihu were selected for validation figs s4 5 the results of which are consistent with previous studies liu et al 2021 mccullough et al 2013 pilati et al 2016 in addition the spatial distribution of s d fig s6 depicts those regions with relatively higher s d value such as in north america northeast europe and the qinghai tibet plateau show a similar spatial pattern of global lakes sdd fig 6a suggesting that lakes with higher water clarity are likely to be influenced by external factors the magnitude of the variations in lake sdd can be further revealed via the coefficient of variation cv which is shown in fig s7 lakes with large cv i e 0 3 are mostly located in the southern hemisphere and low latitude regions such as the central us and southern asia which may be related to the intense anthropogenic disturbance to those regions wang et al 2021 4 4 trend analysis of global lakes sdd the temporal trend of global lakes sdd shows weak declining water clarity slope 0 013 m y from 2014 to 2020 through the mk trend test figs 8 9 among these lakes 15 840 indicate insignificant stable or variable sdd trends slope 0 013 m y 392 indicate declining sdd trends slope 0 205 m y and 243 lakes indicate increasing sdd trends slope 0 182 m y the trend test of the global lakes sdd shows that lakes with positive change rates are mainly distributed in the regions with high clarity such as north america europe eastern russian and qinghai tibet plateau fig 8 however lakes with negative change rates of sdd were also widely distributed in these regions fig 8 for example the difference of the number between lakes with increasing trend and decreasing trend ndif between 75 and 76 w is the largest ndif 142 over all the other regions where most of the lakes in the mid high latitude 40 n 80 n are dominated by decreasing change rates fig 10 b c these findings imply that global lakes are mostly experiencing decreasing water clarity in general especially those with high water clarity fig 9 shows the temporal changes in global lakes sdd between 2014 and 2020 global lakes were classified into four groups all significantly increased significantly decreased and insignificant two periods of sdd changes are clearly detected in fig 9 between 2014 and 2018 global lakes sdd decrease gradually fig 9a the sdd of lakes with an insignificant trend reflects the similar pattern fig 9d while the sdd of lakes with significant trends showed stable changes fig 9b c in addition sdd in lakes with an insignificant trend fig 9d showed a continuous increase between 2018 and 2020 fig 9d furthermore five groups of lakes were categorized with different sdd values as shown in fig 9 sdd 2 m 2 4 m 4 6 m 6 8 m and 8 m the changes in the number of global lakes can be divided into several periods between 2014 and 2018 the number of lakes with an sdd 2 m rapidly increased followed by a continuous decrease between 2018 and 2020 the number of lakes with an sdd of 2 4 m showed a negative change with an sdd of less than 2 m the number of lakes with an sdd of 6 8 m or more than 8 m shows an increasing trend between 2014 and 2020 with slopes of 3 536 and 1 643 respectively the number of lakes with an sdd of 4 6 m slope 8 306 decreased until 2015 followed by an unceasing increase between 2015 and 2017 then suddenly increased in 2018 and recovered between 2019 and 2020 the number of low and middle clarity sdd 4 m lakes is changing dramatically while that of high clarity 4 m is increasing gradually 5 discussion 5 1 cons and pros of the dgrn model and future improvement dgrn is a deep learning based model which was developed based on the relationship between in situ sdd and six bands of landsat 8 surface reflectance images different from anns and mlpnns the former two full connected layers of blocks in the dgrn model could separate the model input for each batch into more features equal to the width then the outputs for each block can be derived from the sequence information by passing the gru layers thus the dgrn model could fully capture the sequence information for each batch of training sets by stacking a gru layer and a full connected layer bridging a more efficient and robust way connecting surface reflectance and water clarity and overcoming the limitations of traditional anns and mlpnns in contrast to the deep learning based model spectra based empirical models are commonly applied to construct the relationship between bands of satellite images and sdd according to previous studies and the performance of these models allan et al 2011 allee and johnson 1999 cozar et al 2005 dona et al 2014 doron et al 2011 duan et al 2009 guan et al 2011 harma et al 2001 mancino et al 2009 mccullough et al 2013 olmanson et al 2011 zhang et al 2021c were inter compared in this study table 2 in summary the model was constructed based on the blue green red and nir bands of landsat images such as the single band models allan et al 2011 allee and johnson 1999 dona et al 2014 mccullough et al 2013 zhang et al 2021c exponential models dona et al 2014 zhang et al 2021c and band ratio models doron et al 2011 duan et al 2009 guan et al 2011 harma et al 2001 mancino et al 2009 olmanson et al 2011 the above mentioned models exhibited excellent performance in the study areas thus we compared the above spectra based empirical models with dgrn using in situ datasets in this study the results demonstrated that dgrn has higher accuracy in terms of r2 while the accuracy of the band ratio model based on multiple bands is far better than that of other empirical models table 2 additionally an obvious advantage is that the model can be easily implemented into other earth resources and ocean color satellites e g sentinel 2 gao fen series etc specifically the next generation of landsat series dataset landsat 9 to derive spatial temporal sdd patterns in global lakes the current limitations of the dgrn model are mainly constrained by image processing and in situ measured data first it is difficult to acquire high quality cloud ice and snow free surface reflectance images the large variability in total ice duration causes uncertainty in estimating the duration of the snow ice free period in high latitude and high altitude lake ecosystems due to continued global warming cai et al 2019 pilla and williamson 2022 woolway et al 2020 for example the ice cover duration of lakes in north america often ranges from 0 to 300 days pilla and williamson 2022 while in the qinghai tibet plateau it is approximately 157 78 days cai et al 2019 because of the drastic changes in the ice cover duration some studies screened high quality remote sensing images from june to october as the ice free season in china zhang et al 2021c to avoid the high reflectance from snow and ice and ensure adequate images this study selected the snow ice free season august to october during 2014 and 2020 as a stopgap measure to estimate the annual lake average of sdd nevertheless an accurate evaluation of the total ice duration for each lake should be considered to acquire more precise images in the future secondly it is challenging for remote sensing to classify shallow and deep waters removing the contribution of bottom reflectance spectra doron et al 2011 zhang et al 2021c the bottom reflectance of deep and clear waters contributes significantly to the surface reflectance spectra of remote sensing and underestimates the actual sdd the in situ samples collected in this study were measured in the lakes where the optical depth was lower than the maximum water depth to avoid the influence of the bottom reflectance however the reflectance from the lake bottom inevitably causes uncertainty and errors in some optically deep lakes zhang et al 2021c 5 2 the attribution of lake specific characteristics to the global distribution pattern of sdd in this study six lake specific characteristics that is area discharge depth residence time elevation and the ratio of area and depth area depth were derived from the hydrolakes datasets https www hydrosheds org page hydrolakes to diagnose their impacts on the lake average of sdd fig 10a m as shown in fig 10 the lake specific characteristics were ln transformed for example sdd tends to be stable with lake area fig 10b and it increases gradually in lakes with increasing lake depth fig 10f however lake sdd first increased with elevation discharge and residence time and then started to decrease fig 10d j h these results are consistent with previous studies suggesting that sdd increases with elevation or depth and tends to be stable with the increased area liu et al 2020 loria et al 2020 olmanson et al 2014 the contrasting trends in the changes in sdd are driven by the comprehensive influence of climate change and anthropogenic activities that support the turbidity of each lake the lake specific area depth is mainly distributed between 200 and 100 000 km and higher lake specific area depth is attributed to the higher lake specific area or lower depth demonstrating that these lakes are more susceptible to anthropogenic activities and climate change sdd increases as the area depth increases from 0 to 200 km and then sdd starts to decrease when area depth increases from 200 to 20 000 km suggesting that area depth around 200 km is a threshold for maintaining lake clarity feature importance fi algorithms provided by random forest were employed to estimate the contribution to the sdd of lake specific characteristics fig 10m demonstrates that the order of the characteristic contributions as follows depth fi 0 31 elevation fi 0 20 residence time fi 0 15 discharge fi 0 13 area depth fi 0 11 and area fi 0 10 according to a previous study comprising global 573 lakes qin et al 2020 the concentration of nutrients decreases with lake depth which causes eutrophication and algal blooms occurring mostly in shallow lakes leading to an improvement in water clarity on the other hand lake specific depth determines the effects of wind on water clarity reardon et al 2014 wind induced sediment resuspension affects water clarity in shallow lakes by stimulating the wave momentum and reflecting on the resuspension of bed particles in the water column however it is difficult to occur in deep waters because of the steady mixing regimes dai et al 2018 kraemer et al 2020 reardon et al 2014 woolway and merchant 2019 therefore it is inevitable that lake specific depth is the most influential factor in sdd and its latitudinal zonality 5 3 water clarity change during covid 19 in 2019 the coronavirus pandemic covid 19 outbroke worldwide mizumoto et al 2020 zhu et al 2019 causing many unprecedented sufferings yang et al 2021 people around the world had to adopt various restriction measures such as lockdown orders to reduce the risks of infection tian et al 2020 therefore the intensity of anthropogenic activities has slowed down nearly all over the world yang et al 2021 resulting in the improvement of water clarity found in recent studies in lagoons rivers lakes callejas et al 2021 liu et al 2022 yunus et al 2020 during the lockdown period social and industrial activities i e industrial discharges and public interactions were restrained for several weeks yunus et al 2020 then air quality was significantly increased yang et al 2021 which might subsequently reduce atmospheric deposition industrial sewage discharges and railway transport passenger volume resulting in a declination in total suspended solids concentration and sediment resuspension in aquatic ecosystems callejas et al 2021 liu et al 2022 xu et al 2021 and in turn increased water clarity in terms of sdd li et al 2020 shi et al 2018 it is interesting to see that this hypothesis is supported by the results of the current study the global distribution of normalized difference of sdd nd fig 11 which is defined as n d l a k e 100 s d d 2020 l a k e s d d n l a k e s d d m e a n l a k e n represents the sdd in 2019 or the average during 2014 and 2019 suggesting that sdd in 2020 is relatively higher than that during 2014 and 2020 as shown by the contrast between fig 11a and b the dramatic improvement of nd in 2020 with an average of 11 37 fig 11a or 6 41 fig 11b emphasizes that the water clarity increased during the lockdown period due to covid 19 from a global perspective the changes in global lake nd indicate a latitude zonality due to different restrictions and intervention measures in different regions kraemer et al 2020 shadmi et al 2020 and suggest a positive and dramatic change in sdd as latitude increases for instance nd in southern china which has been experiencing long term anthropogenic activities yu et al 2021 has positively been changed under rigorous restriction measures and the reduction of pollutant discharges kraemer et al 2020 liu et al 2022 especially in hubei province fig 11c d the changes in lake nd in brazil and australia fig 11a b showed insignificant tendencies during covid 19 under the generous measures shadmi et al 2020 to trace the flow of sdd changes and anomalies in global lakes during covid 19 fig 12 uses sankey diagrams to depict how sdd and its anomalies varied between 2019 and 2020 on a global scale changes in sdd and their anomalies were divided into five groups 2 m 2 4 m 4 6 m 6 8 m 8 m and 0 m 0 0 5 m 0 5 1 m 1 2 m and 2 m fig 12a shows that sdd in 11 855 lakes 72 0 did not change to the different groups whereas sdd increased in 2446 lakes 14 8 and decreased in 2174 lakes 13 2 between 2019 and 2020 according to fig 12b sdd anomalies in a large number of lakes 6249 37 9 remained stable with 5707 lakes 34 7 showing positive trends while 4519 lakes 27 4 showed negative trends figs 11 12 demonstrate that increased water clarity was found in most global lakes during covid 19 which could be the result of reduced anthropogenic activities after rigorous restrictive measures and lockdowns shadmi et al 2020 during the long term decreasing trends of water clarity figs 8 9 the reduction of anthropogenic activities would help lakes recover the water clarity in general and save the environment of the aquatic ecosystem except for natural high clarity lakes 6 conclusion this study proposed a novel deep learning based model to estimate the secchi disk depth sdd of global lakes using landsat 8 oli surface reflectance images in the ice free season from 2014 to 2020 we found that 1 the deep gated recurrent network dgrn model trained with 70 of the in situ sdd data and surface reflectance of images exhibited superior performance r2 0 84 mae 0 55 rmse 0 83 mape 45 13 by intercomparing the results with other 7 regression or machine deep learning models 2 the dgrn model was capable of estimating sdd in global lakes area 10 km2 and identified the spatial distribution of the lake average sdd the average dgrn predicted sdd is 1 88 1 24 m with an obvious latitude zonality the sdd and standard deviation of the lakes in canada europe and the qinghai tibet plateau were higher than those in the other regions showing that these lakes were likely to be influenced by external factors 3 the dgrn model retrieved the temporal trends of sdd in 16 475 lakes from 2014 to 2020 an insignificant negative trend slope 0 013 m y of sdd was observed in all the lakes the lake average of the 243 lakes sdd significantly increased at a rate of 0 182 m y p 0 05 while the sdd of the 392 lakes showed a significant decrease at a rate of 0 205 m y p 0 05 among these lakes the overall decreasing trend can be further described by the increasing number of lakes with a low sdd i e less than 2 m and a decreasing number of lakes with an sdd of 2 4 m 4 the spatial difference of global lakes sdd was successfully estimated by the dgrn model which suggested an increasing trend of sdd during the covid 19 pandemic sdd was also found to be closely related to lake specific characteristics especially lake specific depth considering further model improvement the acquisition of high quality images in various snow ice free seasons with the removal of the lake bottom reflectance was limited by the understanding of the optical process in global lakes indicating that the proposed dgrn would require higher quality images to estimate sdd accurately declaration of competing interest all authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

16151,bioaugmentation is an attractive method to improve methane production mp in the anaerobic digestion ad process in this study to tackle the ammonia inhibition problem a long term operating over 6 months acclimatized consortia and a well constructed consortia were selected as the bioaugmentation consortia for sequencing batch ad reactors fed with dairy manure and pig manure under mesophilic condition similar responses in terms of the reactor performance and microorganisms structure to the different consortia were observed with both manure kinds indicating that the effectiveness of bioaugmentation was mainly decided by the composition of the added consortia not the feedstock 39 49 increment in mp was obtained in the reactors bioaugmented with well constructed consortia which was higher than the acclimatized consortia about 25 increment in mp both acetogenesis and methanogenesis advantageous steps were stimulated with well constructed consortia bioaugmentation according to key functional enzyme analysis the increment of glycine hydroxymethyltransferase and phosphoglycerate mutase might be the critical point in the bioaugmented ad system based on the higher functional contribution rate of the well constructed consortia bioaugmentation reactors methanosarcina could have expressed more comprehensive functions or performed stronger activities in different functions than methanosaeta graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords bioaugmentation acclimatized consortia well constructed consortia metagenomics functional enzyme 1 introduction the amount of livestock manure is increasing rapidly in a few concentrated areas in china currently with the development of large scale and intensive livestock production approximately 38 million tons of livestock manure are produced annually gao et al 2018 however efficient waste management to handle this large amount of manure and prevent environmental pollution still needs exploring anaerobic digestion ad is an environment friendly method capable of organic content wastes treatment with renewable energy e g biogas hydrogen recovery de clercq et al 2016 deng et al 2017 which could be adopted for livestock manures treatment however the ad process of manures which is a kind of nitrogen rich organic waste could always face ammonia inhibition problems angelidaki 1994 nakakubo et al 2008 ammonia inhibition levels reported for ad process of manure ranged between 2 6 and 8 0 g l angelidaki and ahring 1993 jiang et al 2019 krylova et al 1997 ammonia toxicity especially the free ammonia nh3 toxicity could cause over 30 of methane production mp loss and even lead to a collapse in anaerobic digesters chen et al 2008 fotidis et al 2013 in previous study the most widely accepted mechanism explaining ammonia toxicity is that high ammonia levels could lead to the change in intracellular ph increment in maintenance energy requirement depletion of intracellular potassium and inhibition of specific enzyme reactions wittmann et al 1996 various strategies have been examined to control or recover from the adverse effects of ammonia inhibition in anaerobic systems such as lowering the reactor temperature decreasing ph values or diluting with distilled water angelidaki 1994 nielsen and angelidaki 2008 yenigun and demirel 2013 however these physical chemical methods are cost intensive time consuming and may affect the ad process negatively by decreasing microbial activity and biomass concentration bioaugmentation which involves addition of specific strains or consortia into a system to enhance a desired activity has recently been studied and gained considerable attention in recovering mp under high ammonia levels in previous studies ad reactors bioaugmented with pure strains have been proved to be an effective method fotidis et al 2014 yang et al 2019 nevertheless using pure strains as bioaugmentation consortia is cost intensive with specific technical difficulties require sterile conditions special growth media etc de roy et al 2014 compared with pure strains complex bioaugmentation consortia from bioaugmented reactors could be more robust and may be well adapted to high ammonia levels in the ad process yet for ad systems fed with practical organic waste wastewater like livestock manure the bioaugmentation performance of complex consortia remains unclear ad is a four step process consisting of hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis angelidaki et al 2011 acidogenesis in which organic matter is converted into volatile fatty acid vfa is a fundamental step during the ad process of complex organics liu et al 2012 acetogenesis is the vital step that produces acetate a crucial intermediate product and the main driver of the overall methane production li et al 2019 in our previous studies vfa composition formed during the acidogenesis and acetogenesis steps played a crucial role in the bioaugmentation effect and microbial community under high ammonia levels yang et al 2018 2019 although the vfa accumulation in bioaugmentation processes for organic substrates has been reported in previous studies ferraro et al 2020 xu et al 2022 the dynamic analysis on the generation and consumption of vfa and their correlations with the bioaugmentation effect have never been investigated in continuously operating bioaugmented ad systems so far thus to understand the interaction of bioaugmentation and vfa composition it is imperative to investigate the vfa profile during practical manure degradation the development of 16s rrna over the past decade greatly facilitated in depth applications of bioinformatics tools in the studies of microbial communities in ad systems fotidis et al 2017 yang et al 2019 in previous ad reactors bioaugmented with pure strains changes in metabolic pathways were relatively clear due to the known bioaugmented consortia yang et al 2019 2020 however with complex bioaugmentation consortia and practical livestock manure the detection of functional information such as functional genera functional enzymes and biological pathway shifts in bioaugmentation systems are more complex and virtually unknown although the possible limiting step in the metabolic pathway under ammonia inhibition may be revealed with metagenomic analysis there is still a big gap on how to identify potential functional microorganisms how to effectively understand the underlying biological features of microbial communities and how to use this information to maximize mp in bioaugmented ad system based on the above consideration the objectives of this research were 1 to investigate the bioaugmentation effects of complex consortia on acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis of practical livestock manure 2 to identify potential functional microorganisms and reveal the underlying biological features of microbial communities and biochemical pathways via metagenomic analysis 2 materials and methods 2 1

shown in table s1 supporting information the organic matter concentration delivered to the reactors during the bioaugmentation was less than 2 of the olr and its effects on mp or vfas were considered

according to our previous publication yang et al 2017 2 4 high throughput 16s rrna gene sequencing and analysis samples from the bioaugmentation consortia and the dm and pm reactors at the steady state in period iii were retrieved to elucidate possible changes in the relative abundance of the bacterial and archaeal populations detailed information on dna extraction primers purified amplicons and others are shown in the supporting information supporting information relative abundance was defined as the number of sequences affiliated with a taxon divided by the total number of sequences per sample phylum class order and genus making up less than 2 of the total composition in all samples were summed and indicated as others 2 5 metagenomics analysis to estimate the underlying biological features of the microbial communities based on functional information samples from the reactors with pm as substrate at the steady state in period iii were sampled for metagenomics analysis dna was

statistical significance the gas volume reported in this study was calibrated to standard temperature 273 k and pressure 1 atm the steady state period was defined as the relative variation in mp and vfa production less than 10 the gas and liquid samples were taken every three days for analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 reactors performance the reactors were operated for 124 days achieving steady states in both periods i and iii period i was used as a baseline for determining possible enhancements with different bioaugmentation consortia the mps in all the reactors during each period are illustrated in fig 1 the mps in the reactors fed with pm were higher than with dm which may be due to the higher lignocellulose content in the dm low biodegradability table 1 bio methane potential assay bmp assay details in supporting information indicated that the maximum mp of the dm and pm were 349 15 ml g vsadded and 421 15 ml g vsadded respectively fig s3 supporting information in period i all the reactors remained at a steady state the mps were around 140 ml g vsadded in the dm reactors which was about 40 of the bmp in the pm reactors the mps were around 215 ml g vsadded which was about 50 of the bmp throughout period ii different bioaugmentation consortia were added to the bioaugmentation reactors in period iii the mp in the bioaugmentation reactors increased until reaching new steady states the mps of dm1 137 6 ml g vsadded and pm1 220 12 ml g vsadded without bioaugmentation at the steady state in period iii were not significantly different from those in period i p 0 05 in the steady state of period iii days 91 124 the mp in dm2 173 5 ml g vsadded was approximately 26 higher than that in period i the mp in dm3 was 191 7 ml g vsadded which was 39 higher than that in dm1 despite the high increase in mp the mp only reached about 56 of dm s bmp similarly pm2 showed a better mp with 25 higher mp than pm1 surprisingly the mp in pm3 increased by 49 compared with the mp in period i which was about 76 of the pm s bmp suggesting that pm3 was resilient to ammonia inhibition the lower mp in the dm reactors and the comparatively lower mitigation effect should not solely be ascribed to ammonia inhibition but also the high proportion of lignocellulose which is less biodegradable due to its inherent recalcitrant structure veluchamy et al 2017 nevertheless bioaugmentation with different consortia exhibited different effects on reactor performance bioaugmentation with well constructed consortia dm3 and pm3 was better than acclimatized consortia dm2 and pm2 the influence of bioaugmentation on acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis steps will be discussed in sections 3 3 for methanogenesis step and 3 4 for acidogenesis and acetogenesis steps overall the above result clearly showed that complex digestate could be successfully used as bioaugmentation consortia to mitigate the ammonia inhibition problem in ad systems compared with dilution temperature lowering nielsen and angelidaki 2008 or pure strains addition yang et al 2019 suitable bioaugmentation consortia selection and addition can be considered an economically viable choice to mitigate ammonia toxicity during the ad process 3 2 volatile fatty acid concentration and ph as shown in fig 2 the total vfa tvfa concentrations in the pm reactors in period i 2800 3000 mg l were significantly higher p 0 05 than those in the dm reactors 1800 2200 mg l this phenomenon may be due to the higher carbon but lower lignocellulose concentration better hydrolysis and acidogenesis behavior of pm than dm table 1 at the steady state in period iii days 91 124 consistent with the lower mp the tvfa concentration in dm1 was significantly higher p 0 05 than those in dm2 and dm3 especially the tvfa accumulation in the dm3 reactor after bioaugmentation remained stable and was only about 1000 mg l a significant tvfa concentration difference p 0 05 was also found in the pm reactors compared with pm1 around 3000 mg l the tvfa concentration decreased to about 2000 mg l in pm2 and about 1500 mg l in pm3 in period i the ph was about 7 3 in the dm reactors and about 7 5 in the pm reactors and in period iii the ph stabilized around 7 1 7 4 in all the reactors the ph levels in all the reactors remained within the suitable range for the ad process throughout the experiment liu et al 2008 indicating that bioaugmentation did not exert any significant effect on ph the results of this study suggest that bioaugmentation with well constructed consortia could better enhance vfa degradation and lead to higher mps compared to bioaugmentation with long term acclimated consortia 3 3 exploration on methanogenesis specific methanogenic activity sma test based on the previous discussion to explore the effect of bioaugmentation with the different consortia on methanogenesis in the reactors a series of sma tests with h2 co2 or acetate as a substrate was carried out at the steady state of period iii shown in fig 3 generally the pm reactors had higher mp than the dm reactors in all the reactors the activity of hydrogenotrophic methanogens was higher 8 70 than that of aceticlastic methanogens consistent with our previous studies yang et al 2018 2019 the smas of both acetate and h2 co2 in the bioaugmented reactors dm2 dm3 pm2 and pm3 were higher than those in the non augmented reactors dm1 and pm1 indicating that bioaugmentation with complex bioaugmented seeds is a promising approach to enhance the activities of methanogens in the dm reactors dm2 and dm3 both showed higher sma of acetate and h2 co2 than dm1 compared with dm2 dm3 had a higher impact on methanogenesis by strengthening both the aceticlastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenic pathways similarly in the pm reactors the higher mp in pm3 than both pm1 and pm2 indicates the methanogenesis step was enhanced considerably after adding s c 3 4 exploration on acidogenesis and acetogenesis vfa profile test results presented in previous sections 3 1 and 3 2 in this study suggest bioaugmentation with different complex cultures had varying influences on the mp and tvfa concentration to explore the different bioaugmentation effects on acidogenesis and acetogenesis the vfa profiles in period iii were described after a steady state was achieved the methane production rate mpr and vfa profiles are presented in fig 4 the vfa concentration and composition at 72 h were similar to those at 0 h and the stable performance indicates the repeatability of the vfa generation and degradation profiles also the cumulative methane yields of all the reactors in the vfa profile test fig s4 were similar to the mp in period iii fig 1 proving the reliability of this test in dm1 propionate accumulated as the dominant vfa during dm digestion and the maximum mpr appeared at 24 h the maximum mpr in dm2 also appeared at 24 h but with a noticeable reduction about 30 decrement in tvfa unlike dm1 acetate accumulated as the dominant vfa in dm2 accompanied by lower propionate concentration suggesting that bioaugmentation with acclimatized consortia s a could mainly strengthen the acetogenesis step the maximum mpr in dm3 also appeared at 24 h with a rapid depletion in acetate at 12 h the dominant vfa in dm3 was still propionate but propionate concentration was significantly lower about 50 lower than that in dm1 indicating that bioaugmentation with s c could strengthen both the acetogenesis and aceticlastic methanogenesis steps meanwhile acetogenesis in dm3 was weaker than dm2 with a higher propionate accumulation in pm1 propionate accumulated as the dominant vfa and the maximum mpr appeared at 24 h in pm2 the dominant vfas were acetate and propionate further indicating that bioaugmentation with acclimatized consortia could mainly strengthen the acetogenesis step in pm3 the maximum mpr appeared at 12 h earlier than pm1 24 h indicating that the well constructed consortia addition could strengthen methanogenesis propionate accumulated as the dominant vfa during the whole test in pm3 which was about 50 lower than that in pm1 demonstrating that bioaugmentation with well constructed consortia s c could strengthen both the acetogenesis and aceticlastic methanogenesis steps while similar to the dm reactors acetogenesis in pm3 was weaker than pm2 higher propionate accumulation altogether the vfa profile test showed similar performances in the dm and pm reactors bioaugmentation with acclimatized consortia could strengthen acetogenesis advantageous and methanogenesis steps the accumulation of acetate in reactors bioaugmented with acclimatized consortia still indicated some deficiency in methanogenesis in order to further improve the performance decreasing olr cheng et al 2016 adding carrier or mineral filler chen et al 2014 jadhav et al 2021 xu et al 2019a could be considered as useful approaches to increase methanogenesis bioaugmentation with well constructed consortia could also strengthen acetogenesis and methanogenesis advantageous steps resulting in higher mps based on the above discussion a preliminary notion could be considered that the effect of bioaugmentation on the ad process was mainly decided by the bioaugmentation consortia not the feedstock bioaugmentation with well constructed consortia showed better performances than bioaugmentation with acclimatized consortia leading to the higher profits of renewable energy while the domestication of well constructed consortia needs a higher cost than that of acclimatized consortia due to acclimation of pure strains adding chemicals and so on for developing the scale up process of bioaugmentation a comprehensive evaluation on economic including the cost of consortia domestication profit of renewable energy is needed in the future researches 3 5 microbial community the archaeal and bacterial communities in the pm reactors are depicted in fig 5 the phylogenetic classification of archaea showed that methanosarcinales and methanobacterials were dominant the relative abundance of methanosaeta increased to 6 9 in pm2 which was 4 fold higher than that in pm1 according to table 2 methanosaeta was dominant in s b 20 indicating an efficient bioaugmentation effect in pm2 the increased relative abundance of methanosaeta shows that bioaugmentation consortia with complex microbial communities could enhance the resilience of microbial communities towards environmental changes additionally based on the vfa profile test chapter 3 3 s b addition could strengthen the acetogenesis step which is the crucial step to produce acetate compared with pm1 a suitable environment for the aceticlastic methanogen methanosaeta s growth was created with the accumulation of acetate direct substrate of aceticlastic methanogen fig 4 a under a low vfa condition ruan et al 2019 meanwhile the accumulation of acetate indicated that aceticlastic methanogenic activity needed to be further strengthened in pm3 the relative abundance of methanobrevibacter was 5 7 about 2 3 fold higher than that in pm1 methanobrevibacter which was dominant in s c had a positive effect on mp increment in a previous study yang et al 2019 additionally compared with pm2 the sma of acetate in pm3 was higher with a lower relative abundance of methanosaeta indicating that the facultative aceticlastic methanogen methanosarcina might have performed aceticlastic methanogenesis as shown in fig 5 b1 the dominant phyla belonged to firmicutes bacteroidetes and actinobacteria which were also found in high efficient ad reactors han et al 2016 yang et al 2018 the most abundant class was clostridia the relative abundance of which increased after bioaugmentation fig 5 b2 certain clostridia related species were found to perform a similar function as syntrophic acetate oxidizing bacteria saob which could cleavage acetate into co2 and h2 teixeira et al 2010 in pm2 the relative abundance of hydrogenotrophic methanogens was slightly decreased with an increment in the hydrogenotrophic methanogenic pathway sma fig 3 indicating that methanosarcina might have performed hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis in pm2 in pm3 the relative abundance of actinobacteria was 76 higher than that in pm1 increasing to 9 5 actinobacteria was the dominant class in s c 10 table 2 and the increased relative abundance of actinobacteria indicates that s c addition was an efficient bioaugmentation approach actinobacteria could degrade organic matters into small molecules such as acetate co2 etc ghai et al 2011 peleg et al 2008 therefore combining the results with the vfa profile test fig 4 the increased relative abundance of actinobacteria further proved that bioaugmentation with s c could enhance the acidogenesis step the microbial communities of the dm reactors at a steady state in period iii were also collected and analyzed the richness and diversity of the microbial communities of all samples were similar table s2 indicating that the abundance of microbial community was similar after bioaugmentation the coverage values were all above 99 95 the phylogenetic classification of archaea and bacteria in the dm reactors is illustrated in fig 5 c d similar to the distribution in the pm reactors methanosarcinales and methanobacterials were dominant in all dm reactors even though the compositions of the dominant order were different methanosarcina was the main genus in methanosarcinales while in dm2 methanosarcina and methanosaeta were the main genera after bioaugmentation with s a the relative abundance of methanosaeta increased 13 fold in dm2 compared with dm1 only 2 in dm3 the relative abundance of methanobrevibacter was 15 2 about 1 5 fold higher than that in dm1 the dominant bacteria class was clostridia belongs to firmicutes 62 compared with dm1 the relative abundances of hydrogenotrophic methanogens decreased in dm2 while the relative abundance of clostridia and the activity of the hydrogenotrophic methanogenic pathway increased sma fig 3 therefore it could be preliminarily inferred that methanosarcina might have mainly expressed the function of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis in dm2 in dm3 the relative abundance of actinobacteria increased significantly to 6 5 which was twice that in dm1 contributing to the enhancement of the acidogenesis step according to the microbial community analysis in the pm and dm reactors it was clear that bioaugmentation with both acclimatized consortia and well constructed consortia could efficiently enhance ad reactors performance due to similar changes in the pm and dm reactors it could be deduced that the function and response of the microorganism to similar bioaugmentation consortia were consistent despite feeding with different substrates 3 6 metagenomic analysis functional profiling and biochemical pathway a further metagenomic analysis was conducted in the pm reactors to reveal the effect of bioaugmentation on functional profiling and biochemical pathway the numbers of quality control filtered metagenomic reads are summarized in table s3 the functional genes were annotated using the kegg database fig 6 the distribution of kegg pathway levels was similar in all pm reactors the dominant kegg pathway level was metabolism including amino acid metabolism da and carbohydrate metabolism dc which were important pathway levels during the ad process of organics zhang et al 2017 2019 the abundance of different kegg pathway levels increased after bioaugmentation indicating a positive effect on the activities of pathways through bioaugmentation after bioaugmentation over 15 and over 30 increment on the abundances of metabolism from da to dl were observed in pm2 and pm3 respectively also about 20 and over 30 increment was found on the typical levels of genetic information processing from fa to fd in pm2 and pm3 respectively meanwhile the abundance of the kegg pathway levels in pm3 was generally higher than those in pm2 indicating a stronger stimulative effect of well constructed consortia addition than acclimatized consortia addition the key functional enzymes associated with the two methanogenic pathways based on the kegg database were analyzed in fig 7 generally after bioaugmentation higher abundances of functional enzymes were exhibited in the reactors pm2 and pm3 functional genes encoding enzymes were also enhanced by bioaugmentation consortia addition fig 7 a compared to pm1 functional enzymes and genes associated with the acetate decarboxylation pathway were 5 25 greater in pm2 and 15 70 greater in pm3 including acetate kinase ec 2 7 2 1 phosphate acetyltransferase ec 2 3 1 8 acetate coa ligase ec 6 2 1 1 acetyl coa c acetyltransferase ec 2 3 1 9 phosphopyruvate hydratase ec 4 2 1 11 phosphoglycerate mutase ec 5 4 2 11 ec 5 4 2 12 phosphoserine transaminase ec 2 6 1 52 and glycine hydroxymethyltransferase ec 2 1 2 1 also functional enzymes and genes associated with the co2 reduction pathway were about 50 higher in pm2 and over 2 fold higher in pm3 including formylmethanofuran dehydrogenase ec 1 2 99 5 and formylmethanofuran tetrahydromethanopterin n formyltransferase ec 2 3 1 101 additionally 5 10 methylenetetrahydromethanopterin reductase ec 1 5 98 2 tetrahydromethanopterin s methyltransferase ec 2 1 1 86 and coenzyme b sulfoethylthiotransferase ec 2 8 4 1 which were involved in the last conversion processes shared by the two methanogenic pathways were also detected abundantly in the bioaugmented reactors wu et al 2017 these results suggest that well constructed consortia addition could show a better performance on both aceticlastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenic pathways than adding acclimatized consortia on the view of enzyme reactions after bioaugmentation the abundance of enzymes was increased especially related enzymes in hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis coinciding with the sma analysis fig 3 in bioaugmented ad reactors pm2 and pm3 about 20 and 45 increment in the abundance of ec 2 3 1 8 and ec 2 3 1 9 was obtained in acetate decarboxylation pathway respectively in co2 reduction pathway 50 increment in the abundance of ec 1 2 99 5 and ec 2 3 1 101 was observed in pm2 along with a doubled increment in pm3 in methanogenesis pathway about 50 and over 120 increase of ec 1 5 98 2 ec 2 1 1 86 and ec 2 8 4 1 was achieved in pm2 and pm3 respectively also in previous study one of the widely accepted mechanisms explaining ammonia toxicity is that high ammonia levels could inhibit specific enzyme reactions wittmann et al 1996 the high abundance of enzyme could enhance the specific enzyme reactions during methanogenesis step leading to higher mp under high ammonia concentration in order to further increase mp the balanced enhancement on two methanogenic pathways was of great important as indicated in our previous study yang et al 2019 considering the more severe ammonia inhibition effect on aceticlastic methanogenesis and this pathway tend to show relatively weak increment even after bioaugmentation as found in the present and previous study yang et al 2019 strengthening acetate decarboxylation pathway was further studied in this research as shown in fig 7 c ammonia toxicity resulted in the inhibition on the aceticlastic related enzyme reactions while bioaugmentation could alleviate ammonia toxicity by increasing the specific enzyme reactions resulting in the enhancement on mp the increment of almost all of the enzymes in pm3 were higher than that in pm2 corresponding to the 16 higher mp in pm3 than in pm2 but the increment of glycine hydroxymethyltransferase ec 2 1 2 1 and phosphoglycerate mutase ec 5 4 2 11 ec 5 4 2 12 was not significant as the other enzymes the aceticlastic methanogenic pathway which considered to be more sensitive to ammonia toxicity jiang et al 2019 yan et al 2019 might be benefit from the further enhancement on conversions of i from glycerate 2p to glycerate 3p and ii from l serine to 5 10 methylene thmpt thus it was suggested in this study that to further boost aceticlastic methanogenesis increasing glycine hydroxymethyltransferase ec 2 1 2 1 and phosphoglycerate mutase ec 5 4 2 11 ec 5 4 2 12 might be the critical points the relative abundance of functional cog categories could show a clear classification on functional profiling xu et al 2019b yin et al 2018 as shown in fig s6 the cog distribution was similar in all pm reactors which had a high relative abundance in metabolism and information storage and processing approximately 35 of the total reads were assigned to amino acid transport and metabolism e metabolism carbohydrate transport and metabolism g metabolism translation ribosomal structure and biogenesis j information storage and processing replication recombination and repair l information storage and processing and cell wall membrane envelope biogenesis m cellular processes and signaling these functional categories correlate with the ad process significantly yin et al 2018 based on the main functional cog categories the contributions of different microbial communities based on the order level top 4 are depicted in fig 8 the contribution rates of clostridiales to all major functions were more than 50 thus the higher the relative abundance of clostridiales in the reactors the higher the contribution rate this result indicates that clostridiales played a crucial role in the main functions during the ad process in addition although the methanogens were the key microorganism in the methanogenesis step the contribution rates of methanosarcinales to various functions were not high 5 the reason could be that the whole ad process is a complex system formed by the synergistic coupling of multiple metabolic pathways li et al 2019 and only a fraction of the main functions was contributed by the methanogenic pathway it is noteworthy that compared to pm1 the relative abundance of methanosarcinales increased after bioaugmentation fig 5 while the contribution rate of methanosarcinales to the main functions decreased in pm2 and increased in pm3 combined with the microbial community analysis the relative abundance of methanosaeta belongs to methanosarcinales in pm2 was significantly higher than that in pm1 while the relative abundance of methanosarcina was lower on the contrary in pm3 a significant increment in the relative abundance of methanosarcina was observed this result preliminarily indicates that the facultative methanogen methanosarcina could express more comprehensive functions or perform stronger activities in different functions than methanosaeta during the ad process 4 conclusions and future prospects during practical manures ad process bioaugmentation with well constructed consortia and acclimatized consortia could benefit to enriching methanobrevibacter and methanosaeta respectively bioaugmentation with well constructed consortia 39 49 increment in methane production could be considered a better approach to alleviate ammonia inhibition than acclimatized consortia about 25 increment in methane production acetogenesis and methanogenesis steps were both strengthened by bioaugmentation acetogenesis step was preferred to be stimulated with acclimatized consortia and methanogenesis step was preferred to be stimulated with well constructed consortia similar responses in terms of methane production tvfa and microorganisms to adding well constructed consortia were attained despite feeding with different substrates according to key functional enzyme analysis the ability to break through the bottleneck to increase glycine hydroxymethyltransferase and phosphoglycerate mutase might be the critical point in the bioaugmented ad system on the point of functional contribution rate methanosarcina could express more comprehensive functions or perform stronger activities in different functions than methanosaeta during the ad process overall bioaugmentation with well constructed consortia performs the potential for industrial applications and provides an approach for the development of high efficient renewable energy future developments on scale up should focus on the economic cost and environmental sustainability aspects the cost of consortia domestication the dosage and frequency of consortia addition the control of operational parameters including mixing speed temperature ph etc should be considered in the future researches advanced sustainability assessment tools such as life cycle assessment exergy based methods can be used in the analysis of bioaugmented ad system from thermodynamic economic and environmental perspectives simultaneously providing a comprehensive evaluation on the efficiency productivity and sustainability of the bioaugmented ad system declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments

16151,bioaugmentation is an attractive method to improve methane production mp in the anaerobic digestion ad process in this study to tackle the ammonia inhibition problem a long term operating over 6 months acclimatized consortia and a well constructed consortia were selected as the bioaugmentation consortia for sequencing batch ad reactors fed with dairy manure and pig manure under mesophilic condition similar responses in terms of the reactor performance and microorganisms structure to the different consortia were observed with both manure kinds indicating that the effectiveness of bioaugmentation was mainly decided by the composition of the added consortia not the feedstock 39 49 increment in mp was obtained in the reactors bioaugmented with well constructed consortia which was higher than the acclimatized consortia about 25 increment in mp both acetogenesis and methanogenesis advantageous steps were stimulated with well constructed consortia bioaugmentation according to key functional enzyme analysis the increment of glycine hydroxymethyltransferase and phosphoglycerate mutase might be the critical point in the bioaugmented ad system based on the higher functional contribution rate of the well constructed consortia bioaugmentation reactors methanosarcina could have expressed more comprehensive functions or performed stronger activities in different functions

livestock manure is increasing rapidly in a few concentrated areas in china currently with the development of large scale and intensive livestock production approximately 38 million tons of livestock manure are produced annually gao et al 2018 however efficient waste management to handle this large amount of manure and prevent environmental pollution still needs exploring anaerobic digestion ad is an environment friendly method capable of organic content wastes treatment with renewable energy e g biogas hydrogen recovery de clercq et al 2016 deng et al 2017 which could be adopted for livestock manures treatment however the ad process of manures which is a kind of nitrogen rich organic waste could always face ammonia inhibition problems angelidaki 1994 nakakubo et al 2008 ammonia inhibition levels reported for ad process of manure ranged between 2 6 and 8 0 g l angelidaki and ahring 1993 jiang et al 2019 krylova et al 1997 ammonia toxicity especially the free ammonia nh3 toxicity could cause over 30 of methane production mp loss and even lead to a collapse in anaerobic digesters chen et al 2008 fotidis et al 2013 in previous study the most widely accepted mechanism explaining ammonia toxicity is that high ammonia levels could lead to the change in intracellular ph increment in maintenance energy requirement depletion of intracellular potassium and inhibition of specific enzyme reactions wittmann et al 1996 various strategies have been examined to control or recover from the adverse effects of ammonia inhibition in anaerobic systems such as lowering the reactor temperature decreasing ph values or diluting with distilled water angelidaki 1994 nielsen and angelidaki 2008 yenigun and demirel 2013 however these physical chemical methods are cost intensive time consuming and may affect the ad process negatively by decreasing microbial activity and biomass concentration bioaugmentation which involves addition of specific strains or consortia into a system to enhance a desired activity has recently been studied and gained considerable attention in recovering mp under high ammonia levels in previous studies ad reactors bioaugmented with pure strains have been proved to be an effective method fotidis et al 2014 yang et al 2019 nevertheless using pure strains as bioaugmentation consortia is cost intensive with specific technical difficulties require sterile conditions special growth media etc de roy et al 2014 compared with pure strains complex bioaugmentation consortia from bioaugmented reactors could be more robust and may be well adapted to high ammonia levels in the ad process yet for ad systems fed with practical organic waste wastewater like livestock manure the bioaugmentation performance of complex consortia remains unclear ad is a four step process consisting of hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis angelidaki et al 2011 acidogenesis in which organic matter is converted into volatile fatty acid vfa is a fundamental step during the ad process of complex organics liu et al 2012 acetogenesis is the vital step that produces acetate a crucial intermediate product and the main driver of the overall methane production li et al 2019 in our previous studies vfa composition formed during the acidogenesis and acetogenesis steps played a crucial role in the bioaugmentation effect and microbial community under high ammonia levels yang et al 2018 2019 although the vfa accumulation in bioaugmentation processes for organic substrates has been reported in previous studies ferraro et al 2020 xu et al 2022 the dynamic analysis on the generation and consumption of vfa and their correlations with the bioaugmentation effect have never been investigated in continuously operating bioaugmented ad systems so far thus to understand the interaction of bioaugmentation and vfa composition it is imperative to investigate the vfa profile during practical manure degradation the development of 16s rrna over the past decade greatly facilitated in depth applications of bioinformatics tools in the studies of microbial communities in ad systems fotidis et al 2017 yang et al 2019 in previous ad reactors bioaugmented with pure strains changes in metabolic pathways were relatively clear due to the known bioaugmented consortia yang et al 2019 2020 however with complex bioaugmentation consortia and practical livestock manure the detection of functional information such as functional genera functional enzymes and biological pathway shifts in bioaugmentation systems are more complex and virtually unknown although the possible limiting step in the metabolic pathway under ammonia inhibition may be revealed with metagenomic analysis there is still a big gap on how to identify potential functional microorganisms how to effectively understand the underlying biological features of microbial communities and how to use this information to maximize mp in bioaugmented ad system based on the above consideration the objectives of this research were 1 to investigate the bioaugmentation effects of complex consortia on acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis of practical livestock manure 2 to

fig s1 the total ammonium nitrogen concentration tan was 1 7 g nh4 n l in the dm reactors and 2 0 g nh4 n l in the pm reactors at the beginning and then tan was increased to about 4 g nh4 n l in dm and pm reactors as the relative variation in methane production was less than 10 period i was started during the start up period ph around 7 0 data not shown in period i days 1 36 the ammonia level was controlled at 4 g nh4 n l by adding proper gram of nh4cl into the reactors the ph was uncontrolled and was about 7 3 in the dm reactors and about 7 5 in the pm reactors in period ii days 37 46 bioaugmentation was performed in two distinct steps days 37 and 46 the added volumes in day 37 and day 46 were 30 ml about 60 mg cell dry weight cdw and 15 ml about 30 mg cdw respectively details are shown in table s1 supporting information the organic matter concentration delivered to the reactors during the bioaugmentation was less than 2 of the olr and its effects on mp or vfas were considered statistically negligible during period ii and iii days 37 124 the reactors were operated continuously with the feedstocks and the tans were kept identical to those in period i 2 2 2 exploration of bioaugmentation on acidogenesis and acetogenesis vfa profile test after period iii to observe the effects of bioaugmentation on acidogenesis and acetogenesis under high ammonia levels triplicate vfa

according to our previous publication yang et al 2017 2 4 high throughput 16s rrna gene sequencing and analysis samples from the bioaugmentation consortia and the dm and pm reactors at the steady state in period iii were retrieved to elucidate possible changes in the relative abundance of the bacterial and archaeal populations detailed information on dna extraction primers purified amplicons and others are shown in the supporting information supporting information relative abundance was defined as the number of sequences affiliated with a taxon divided by the total number of sequences per sample phylum class order and genus making up less than 2 of the total composition in all samples were summed and indicated as others 2 5 metagenomics analysis to estimate the underlying biological features of the microbial communities based on functional information samples from the reactors with pm as substrate at the steady state in period iii were sampled for metagenomics analysis dna was

illumina com scaffolds with a length over 500 bp were extracted and broken into contigs without gaps contigs were used for further gene prediction and annotation details are shown in supporting

annotations are summarized in supporting information 2 6 data analysis kruskal wallis h test and mann whitney u test were used to test the significance of the results and p 0 05 was considered statistical significance the gas volume reported in this study was calibrated to standard temperature 273 k and pressure 1 atm the steady state period was defined as the relative variation in mp and vfa production less than 10 the gas and liquid samples were taken every three days for analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 reactors performance the reactors were operated for 124 days achieving steady states in both periods i and iii period i was used as a baseline for determining possible enhancements with different bioaugmentation consortia the mps in all the reactors during each period are illustrated in fig 1 the mps in the reactors fed with pm were higher than with dm which may be due to the higher lignocellulose content in the dm low biodegradability table 1 bio methane potential assay bmp assay details in supporting information indicated that the maximum mp of the dm and pm were 349 15 ml g vsadded and 421 15 ml g vsadded respectively fig s3 supporting information in period i all the reactors remained at a steady state the mps were around 140 ml g vsadded in the dm reactors which was about 40 of the bmp in the pm reactors the mps were around 215 ml g vsadded which was about 50 of the bmp throughout period ii different bioaugmentation consortia were added to the bioaugmentation reactors in period iii the mp in the bioaugmentation reactors increased until reaching new steady states the mps of dm1 137 6 ml g vsadded and pm1 220 12 ml g vsadded without bioaugmentation at the steady state in period iii were not significantly different from those in period i p 0 05 in the steady state of period iii days 91 124 the mp in dm2 173 5 ml g vsadded was approximately 26 higher than that in period i the mp in dm3 was 191 7 ml g vsadded which was 39 higher than that in dm1 despite the high increase in mp the mp only reached about 56 of dm s bmp similarly pm2 showed a better mp with 25 higher mp than pm1 surprisingly the mp in pm3 increased by 49 compared with the mp in period i which was about 76 of the pm s bmp suggesting that pm3 was resilient to ammonia inhibition the lower mp in the dm reactors and the comparatively lower mitigation effect should not solely be ascribed to ammonia inhibition but also the high proportion of lignocellulose which is less biodegradable due to its inherent recalcitrant structure veluchamy et al 2017 nevertheless bioaugmentation with different consortia exhibited different effects on reactor performance bioaugmentation with well constructed consortia dm3 and pm3 was better than acclimatized consortia dm2 and pm2 the influence of bioaugmentation on acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis steps will be discussed in sections 3 3 for methanogenesis step and 3 4 for acidogenesis and acetogenesis steps overall the above result clearly showed that complex digestate could be successfully used as bioaugmentation consortia to mitigate the ammonia inhibition problem in ad systems compared with dilution temperature lowering nielsen and angelidaki 2008 or pure strains addition yang et al 2019 suitable bioaugmentation consortia selection and addition can be considered an economically viable choice to mitigate ammonia toxicity during the ad process 3 2 volatile fatty acid concentration and ph as shown in fig 2 the total vfa tvfa concentrations in the pm reactors in period i 2800 3000 mg l were significantly higher p 0 05 than those in the dm reactors 1800 2200 mg l this phenomenon may be due to the higher carbon but lower lignocellulose concentration better hydrolysis and acidogenesis behavior of pm than dm table 1 at the steady state in period iii days 91 124 consistent with the lower mp the tvfa concentration in dm1 was significantly higher p 0 05 than those in dm2 and dm3 especially the tvfa accumulation in the dm3 reactor after bioaugmentation remained stable and was only about 1000 mg l a significant tvfa concentration difference p 0 05 was also found in the pm reactors compared with pm1 around 3000 mg l the tvfa concentration decreased to about 2000 mg l in pm2 and about 1500 mg l in pm3 in period i the ph was about 7 3 in the dm reactors and about 7 5 in the pm reactors and in period iii the ph stabilized around 7 1 7 4 in all the reactors the ph levels in all the reactors remained within the suitable range for the ad process throughout the experiment liu et al 2008 indicating that bioaugmentation did not exert any significant effect on ph the results of this study suggest that bioaugmentation with well constructed consortia could better enhance vfa degradation and lead to higher mps compared to bioaugmentation with long term acclimated consortia 3 3 exploration on methanogenesis specific methanogenic activity sma test based on the previous discussion to explore the effect of bioaugmentation with the different consortia on methanogenesis in the reactors a series of sma tests with h2 co2 or acetate as a substrate was carried out at the steady state of period iii shown in fig 3 generally the pm reactors had higher mp than the dm reactors in all the reactors the activity of hydrogenotrophic methanogens was higher 8 70 than that of aceticlastic methanogens consistent with our previous studies yang et al 2018 2019 the smas of both acetate and h2 co2 in the bioaugmented reactors dm2 dm3 pm2 and pm3 were higher than those in the non augmented reactors dm1 and pm1 indicating that bioaugmentation with complex bioaugmented seeds is a promising approach to enhance the activities of methanogens in the dm reactors dm2 and dm3 both showed higher sma of acetate and h2 co2 than dm1 compared with dm2 dm3 had a higher impact on methanogenesis by strengthening both the aceticlastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenic pathways similarly in the pm reactors the higher mp in pm3 than both pm1 and pm2 indicates the methanogenesis step was enhanced considerably after adding s c 3 4 exploration on acidogenesis and acetogenesis vfa profile test results presented in previous sections 3 1 and 3 2 in this study suggest bioaugmentation with different complex cultures had varying influences on the mp and tvfa concentration to explore the different bioaugmentation effects on acidogenesis and acetogenesis the vfa profiles in period iii were described after a steady state was achieved the methane production rate mpr and vfa profiles are presented in fig 4 the vfa concentration and composition at 72 h were similar to those at 0 h and the stable performance indicates the repeatability of the vfa generation and degradation profiles also the cumulative methane yields of all the reactors in the vfa profile test fig s4 were similar to the mp in period iii fig 1 proving the reliability of this test in dm1 propionate accumulated as the dominant vfa during dm digestion and the maximum mpr appeared at 24 h the maximum mpr in dm2 also appeared at 24 h but with a noticeable reduction about 30 decrement in tvfa unlike dm1 acetate accumulated as the dominant vfa in dm2 accompanied by lower propionate concentration suggesting that bioaugmentation with acclimatized consortia s a could mainly strengthen the acetogenesis step the maximum mpr in dm3 also appeared at 24 h with a rapid depletion in acetate at 12 h the dominant vfa in dm3 was still propionate but propionate concentration was significantly lower about 50 lower than that in dm1 indicating that bioaugmentation with s c could strengthen both the acetogenesis and aceticlastic methanogenesis steps meanwhile acetogenesis in dm3 was weaker than dm2 with a higher propionate accumulation in pm1 propionate accumulated as the dominant vfa and the maximum mpr appeared at 24 h in pm2 the dominant vfas were acetate and propionate further indicating that bioaugmentation with acclimatized consortia could mainly strengthen the acetogenesis step in pm3 the maximum mpr appeared at 12 h earlier than pm1 24 h indicating that the well constructed consortia addition could strengthen methanogenesis propionate accumulated as the dominant vfa during the whole test in pm3 which was about 50 lower than that in pm1 demonstrating that bioaugmentation with well constructed consortia s c could strengthen both the acetogenesis and aceticlastic methanogenesis steps while similar to the dm reactors acetogenesis in pm3 was weaker than pm2 higher propionate accumulation altogether the vfa profile test showed similar performances in the dm and pm reactors bioaugmentation with acclimatized consortia could strengthen acetogenesis advantageous and methanogenesis steps the accumulation of acetate in reactors bioaugmented with acclimatized consortia still indicated some deficiency in methanogenesis in order to further improve the performance decreasing olr cheng et al 2016 adding carrier or mineral filler chen et al 2014 jadhav et al 2021 xu et al 2019a could be considered as useful approaches to increase methanogenesis bioaugmentation with well constructed consortia could also strengthen acetogenesis and methanogenesis advantageous steps resulting in higher mps based on the above discussion a preliminary notion could be considered that the effect of bioaugmentation on the ad process was mainly decided by the bioaugmentation consortia not the feedstock bioaugmentation with well constructed consortia showed better performances than bioaugmentation with acclimatized consortia leading to the higher profits of renewable energy while the domestication of well constructed consortia needs a higher cost than that of acclimatized consortia due to acclimation of pure strains adding chemicals and so on for developing the scale up process of bioaugmentation a comprehensive evaluation on economic including the cost of consortia domestication profit of renewable energy is needed in the future researches 3 5 microbial community the archaeal and bacterial communities in the pm reactors are depicted in fig 5 the phylogenetic classification of archaea showed that methanosarcinales and methanobacterials were dominant the relative abundance of methanosaeta increased to 6 9 in pm2 which was 4 fold higher than that in pm1 according to table 2 methanosaeta was dominant in s b 20 indicating an efficient bioaugmentation effect in pm2 the increased relative abundance of methanosaeta shows that bioaugmentation consortia with complex microbial communities could enhance the resilience of microbial communities towards environmental changes additionally based on the vfa profile test chapter 3 3 s b addition could strengthen the acetogenesis step which is the crucial step to produce acetate compared with pm1 a suitable environment for the aceticlastic methanogen methanosaeta s growth was created with the accumulation of acetate direct substrate of aceticlastic methanogen fig 4 a under a low vfa condition ruan et al 2019 meanwhile the accumulation of acetate indicated that aceticlastic methanogenic activity needed to be further strengthened in pm3 the relative abundance of methanobrevibacter was 5 7 about 2 3 fold higher than that in pm1 methanobrevibacter which was dominant in s c had a positive effect on mp increment in a previous study yang et al 2019 additionally compared with pm2 the sma of acetate in pm3 was higher with a lower relative abundance of methanosaeta indicating that the facultative aceticlastic methanogen methanosarcina might have performed aceticlastic methanogenesis as shown in fig 5 b1 the dominant phyla belonged to firmicutes bacteroidetes and actinobacteria which were also found in high efficient ad reactors han et al 2016 yang et al 2018 the most abundant class was clostridia the relative abundance of which increased after bioaugmentation fig 5 b2 certain clostridia related species were found to perform a similar function as syntrophic acetate oxidizing bacteria saob which could cleavage acetate into co2 and h2 teixeira et al 2010 in pm2 the relative abundance of hydrogenotrophic methanogens was slightly decreased with an increment in the hydrogenotrophic methanogenic pathway sma fig 3 indicating that methanosarcina might have performed hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis in pm2 in pm3 the relative abundance of actinobacteria was 76 higher than that in pm1 increasing to 9 5 actinobacteria was the dominant class in s c 10 table 2 and the increased relative abundance of actinobacteria indicates that s c addition was an efficient bioaugmentation approach actinobacteria could degrade organic matters into small molecules such as acetate co2 etc ghai et al 2011 peleg et al 2008 therefore combining the results with the vfa profile test fig 4 the increased relative abundance of actinobacteria further proved that bioaugmentation with s c could enhance the acidogenesis step the microbial communities of the dm reactors at a steady state in period iii were also collected and analyzed the richness and diversity of the microbial communities of all samples were similar table s2 indicating that the abundance of microbial community was similar after bioaugmentation the coverage values were all above 99 95 the phylogenetic classification of archaea and bacteria in the dm reactors is illustrated in fig 5 c d similar to the distribution in the pm reactors methanosarcinales and methanobacterials were dominant in all dm reactors even though the compositions of the dominant order were different methanosarcina was the main genus in methanosarcinales while in dm2 methanosarcina and methanosaeta were the main genera after bioaugmentation with s a the relative abundance of methanosaeta increased 13 fold in dm2 compared with dm1 only 2 in dm3 the relative abundance of methanobrevibacter was 15 2 about 1 5 fold higher than that in dm1 the dominant bacteria class was clostridia belongs to firmicutes 62 compared with dm1 the relative abundances of hydrogenotrophic methanogens decreased in dm2 while the relative abundance of clostridia and the activity of the hydrogenotrophic methanogenic pathway increased sma fig 3 therefore it could be preliminarily inferred that methanosarcina might have mainly expressed the function of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis in dm2 in dm3 the relative abundance of actinobacteria increased significantly to 6 5 which was twice that in dm1 contributing to the enhancement of the acidogenesis step according to the microbial community analysis in the pm and dm reactors it was clear that bioaugmentation with both acclimatized consortia and well constructed consortia could efficiently enhance ad reactors performance due to similar changes in the pm and dm reactors it could be deduced that the function and response of the microorganism to similar bioaugmentation consortia were consistent despite feeding with different substrates 3 6 metagenomic analysis functional profiling and biochemical pathway a further metagenomic analysis was conducted in the pm reactors to reveal the effect of bioaugmentation on functional profiling and biochemical pathway the numbers of quality control filtered metagenomic reads are summarized in table s3 the functional genes were annotated using the kegg database fig 6 the distribution of kegg pathway levels was similar in all pm reactors the dominant kegg pathway level was metabolism including amino acid metabolism da and carbohydrate metabolism dc which were important pathway levels during the ad process of organics zhang et al 2017 2019 the abundance of different kegg pathway levels increased after bioaugmentation indicating a positive effect on the activities of pathways through bioaugmentation after bioaugmentation over 15 and over 30 increment on the abundances of metabolism from da to dl were observed in pm2 and pm3 respectively also about 20 and over 30 increment was found on the typical levels of genetic information processing from fa to fd in pm2 and pm3 respectively meanwhile the abundance of the kegg pathway levels in pm3 was generally higher than those in pm2 indicating a stronger stimulative effect of well constructed consortia addition than acclimatized consortia addition the key functional enzymes associated with the two methanogenic pathways based on the kegg database were analyzed in fig 7 generally after bioaugmentation higher abundances of functional enzymes were exhibited in the reactors pm2 and pm3 functional genes encoding enzymes were also enhanced by bioaugmentation consortia addition fig 7 a compared to pm1 functional enzymes and genes associated with the acetate decarboxylation pathway were 5 25 greater in pm2 and 15 70 greater in pm3 including acetate kinase ec 2 7 2 1 phosphate acetyltransferase ec 2 3 1 8 acetate coa ligase ec 6 2 1 1 acetyl coa c acetyltransferase ec 2 3 1 9 phosphopyruvate hydratase ec 4 2 1 11 phosphoglycerate mutase ec 5 4 2 11 ec 5 4 2 12 phosphoserine transaminase ec 2 6 1 52 and glycine hydroxymethyltransferase ec 2 1 2 1 also functional enzymes and genes associated with the co2 reduction pathway were about 50 higher in pm2 and over 2 fold higher in pm3 including formylmethanofuran dehydrogenase ec 1 2 99 5 and formylmethanofuran tetrahydromethanopterin n formyltransferase ec 2 3 1 101 additionally 5 10 methylenetetrahydromethanopterin reductase ec 1 5 98 2 tetrahydromethanopterin s methyltransferase ec 2 1 1 86 and coenzyme b sulfoethylthiotransferase ec 2 8 4 1 which were involved in the last conversion processes shared by the two methanogenic pathways were also detected abundantly in the bioaugmented reactors wu et al 2017 these results suggest that well constructed consortia addition could show a better performance on both aceticlastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenic pathways than adding acclimatized consortia on the view of enzyme reactions after bioaugmentation the abundance of enzymes was increased especially related enzymes in hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis coinciding with the sma analysis fig 3 in bioaugmented ad reactors pm2 and pm3 about 20 and 45 increment in the abundance of ec 2 3 1 8 and ec 2 3 1 9 was obtained in acetate decarboxylation pathway respectively in co2 reduction pathway 50 increment in the abundance of ec 1 2 99 5 and ec 2 3 1 101 was observed in pm2 along with a doubled increment in pm3 in methanogenesis pathway about 50 and over 120 increase of ec 1 5 98 2 ec 2 1 1 86 and ec 2 8 4 1 was achieved in pm2 and pm3 respectively also in previous study one of the widely accepted mechanisms explaining ammonia toxicity is that high ammonia levels could inhibit specific enzyme reactions wittmann et al 1996 the high abundance of enzyme could enhance the specific enzyme reactions during methanogenesis step leading to higher mp under high ammonia concentration in order to further increase mp the balanced enhancement on two methanogenic pathways was of great important as indicated in our previous study yang et al 2019 considering the more severe ammonia inhibition effect on aceticlastic methanogenesis and this pathway tend to show relatively weak increment even after bioaugmentation as found in the present and previous study yang et al 2019 strengthening acetate decarboxylation pathway was further studied in this research as shown in fig 7 c ammonia toxicity resulted in the inhibition on the aceticlastic related enzyme reactions while bioaugmentation could alleviate ammonia toxicity by increasing the specific enzyme reactions resulting in the enhancement on mp the increment of almost all of the enzymes in pm3 were higher than that in pm2 corresponding to the 16 higher mp in pm3 than in pm2 but the increment of glycine hydroxymethyltransferase ec 2 1 2 1 and phosphoglycerate mutase ec 5 4 2 11 ec 5 4 2 12 was not significant as the other enzymes the aceticlastic methanogenic pathway which considered to be more sensitive to ammonia toxicity jiang et al 2019 yan et al 2019 might be benefit from the further enhancement on conversions of i from glycerate 2p to glycerate 3p and ii from l serine to 5 10 methylene thmpt thus it was suggested in this study that to further boost aceticlastic methanogenesis increasing glycine hydroxymethyltransferase ec 2 1 2 1 and phosphoglycerate mutase ec 5 4 2 11 ec 5 4 2 12 might be the critical points the relative abundance of functional cog categories could show a clear classification on functional profiling xu et al 2019b yin et al 2018 as shown in fig s6 the cog distribution was similar in all pm reactors which had a high relative abundance in metabolism and information storage and processing approximately 35 of the total reads were assigned to amino acid transport and metabolism e metabolism carbohydrate transport and metabolism g metabolism translation ribosomal structure and biogenesis j information storage and processing replication recombination and repair l information storage and processing and cell wall membrane envelope biogenesis m cellular processes and signaling these functional categories correlate with the ad process significantly yin et al 2018 based on the main functional cog categories the contributions of different microbial communities based on the order level top 4 are depicted in fig 8 the contribution rates of clostridiales to all major functions were more than 50 thus the higher the relative abundance of clostridiales in the reactors the higher the contribution rate this result indicates that clostridiales played a crucial role in the main functions during the ad process in addition although the methanogens were the key microorganism in the methanogenesis step the contribution rates of methanosarcinales to various functions were not high 5 the reason could be that the whole ad process is a complex system formed by the synergistic coupling of multiple metabolic pathways li et al 2019 and only a fraction of the main functions was contributed by the methanogenic pathway it is noteworthy that compared to pm1 the relative abundance of methanosarcinales increased after bioaugmentation fig 5 while the contribution rate of methanosarcinales to the main functions decreased in pm2 and increased in pm3 combined with the microbial community analysis the relative abundance of methanosaeta belongs to methanosarcinales in pm2 was significantly higher than that in pm1 while the relative abundance of methanosarcina was lower on the contrary in pm3 a significant increment in the relative abundance of methanosarcina was observed this result preliminarily indicates that the facultative methanogen methanosarcina could express more comprehensive functions or perform stronger activities in different functions than methanosaeta during the ad process 4 conclusions and future prospects during practical manures ad process bioaugmentation with well constructed consortia and acclimatized consortia could benefit to enriching methanobrevibacter and methanosaeta respectively bioaugmentation with well constructed consortia 39 49 increment in methane production could be considered a better approach to alleviate ammonia inhibition than acclimatized consortia about 25 increment in methane production acetogenesis and methanogenesis steps were both strengthened by bioaugmentation acetogenesis step was preferred to be stimulated with acclimatized consortia and methanogenesis step was preferred to be stimulated with well constructed consortia similar responses in terms of methane production tvfa and microorganisms to adding well constructed consortia were attained despite feeding with different substrates according to key functional enzyme analysis the ability to break through the bottleneck to increase glycine hydroxymethyltransferase and phosphoglycerate mutase might be the critical point in the bioaugmented ad system on the point of functional contribution rate methanosarcina could express more comprehensive functions or perform stronger activities in different functions than methanosaeta during the ad process overall bioaugmentation with well constructed consortia performs the potential for industrial applications and provides an approach for the development of high efficient renewable energy future developments on scale up should focus on the economic cost and environmental sustainability aspects the cost of consortia domestication the dosage and frequency of consortia addition the control of operational parameters including mixing speed temperature ph etc should be considered in the future researches advanced sustainability assessment tools such as life cycle assessment exergy based methods can be used in the analysis of bioaugmented ad system from thermodynamic economic and environmental perspectives simultaneously providing a comprehensive evaluation on the efficiency productivity and sustainability of the bioaugmented ad system declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments

filter adsorbers in three drinking water treatment plants in the great lakes region column tests using azide treated sterilized and untreated gac in parallel were used to isolate the two effects it was identified that substantial mib and geosmin biodegradation in the gac was occurring in one location and that gac in some cases had significant adsorption capacity after as much as 9 years of operation four alternative biological parameters adenosine triphosphate esterase activity phosphatase activity and 14c glucose respiration rate were measured to quantify the biological activity of the gac and 14c glucose respiration rate was identified to be a potential indicator for gac biodegradative capacity in terms of mib geosmin and dissolved organic carbon several potential mib and geosmin biodegradation products were also identified using non targeted screening analysis by using the new tools identified in this study we can begin to better understand where adsorption vs biodegradation may predominate under real world conditions e g different temperatures influent concentrations and empty bed contact time leading ultimately to more cost effective use of gac graphical abstract image

very good removal i e percent concentration decrease of mib and geosmin long after the gac would be assumed to be exhausted e g 6 years of service life furthermore the results suggested that the performance of gac at certain locations deteriorated over the first 2 3 service years but then remained relatively unchanged afterwards huang et al 2019 one potential explanation is bioregeneration the previously adsorbed mib and geosmin were desorbed and subsequently degraded by bacteria that grow on the carbon surface thus partially regenerating the in service gac to extend its lifetime an alternative hypothesis is that a combination of adsorption and biodegradation is occurring in gac termed gac biofiltration whereby the biodegradative capacity of the gac does not become exhausted ho et al 2007 this is despite the plant conditions in the survey huang et al 2019 being arguably unfavorable for biodegradation i e low organics cold temperatures lack of ozone prior to the gac it would be helpful to be able to determine the degree to which adsorption or biodegradation were contributing to the removal of geosmin and mib so that plant operations could be adjusted accordingly if biodegradation were shown to dominate removal gac replacement could be deferred with considerable cost savings previous methods to distinguish adsorption from biodegradation across gac are arguably rudimentary persson et al 2007 compared geosmin and mib removal across biologically active carbon bac and biologically active crushed clay assumed to have no adsorption potential for the target compounds with the difference attributable to adsorption however different surface characteristics might have resulted in varying biomass and microbial community in the two media thus resulting in different levels of biodegradation and therefore potentially incorrect conclusions shimabuku et al 2019 evaluated the adsorption and biodegradation of mib in gac by autoclaving the gac to inhibit biological activity however it is not known if autoclaving can inhibit biological activity without affecting the adsorption characteristics of the gac which could impact the validity of the results yuan et al 2022 to address these concerns a recent study conducted by the authors yuan 2021 tested different tools to differentiate adsorption from biodegradation of geosmin and mib across gac and reached the conclusion that continuously applying 300 mg l of sodium azide could effectively supress biological activity in gac without affecting the adsorption of geosmin and mib under conditions similar to those used in the present study we used this approach to investigate the mib and geosmin removal mechanisms across the gac harvested from three drinking water treatment plants in the great lakes region at all three locations the previous survey huang et al 2019 has observed that the gac that had been left in service beyond the expected lifetime of three years in this region could still achieve significant removals of geosmin and mib i e 60 geosmin removal after 6 years of operation the objectives of this study were 1 to understand whether the long term success of gac in the great lakes region was due to adsorption or biodegradation to report on the relative contribution of adsorption vs biodegradation on the in service gacs tested and to observe any correlations with service time 2 to examine potential correlations between biodegradative capacity i e the ability of gac to biodegrade a target compound such as mib or geosmin of the gac and some commonly cited measures of biological activity including adenosine triphosphate atp enzyme activity and 14c glucose respiration rate 3 to examine the effect of i water temperature ii influent concentration iii empty bed contact time ebct on the relative contributions of adsorption vs biodegradation across the harvested gac 4 to investigate the potential metabolic pathway of mib and geosmin in bac 2 material and methods 2 1 gac samples gac was harvested from six gac filter adsorbers in three drinking water treatment plants in ontario canada plant a uses coagulation and flocculation as gac pretreatment processes plant b uses coagulation and ultrafiltration and plant c uses ultrafiltration and ultraviolet uv disinfection the gac influent in the three plants covered a range of background total organic carbon toc from 2 4 to 6 0 mg l core samples across the whole depth of the gac contactors were collected during backwash using either a filter judge usabluebook plant a and b or after the gac contactors were drained using a homemade core sampler plant c the properties of the gac samples are listed in the table 1 the collected gac sample size distribution is shown in table s2 in the supplementary information si 2 2 parallel minicolumn tests to distinguish between adsorption and biodegradation in gac four glass minicolumns 2 54 cm internal diameter and 30 cm length were prepared in parallel all the columns were packed with 10 cm of gac positioned between two 10 cm layers of glass beads 1 mm in diameter to ensure plug flow hydraulics the minicolumn test protocol was adapted from gillogly et al 1999 and recently validated for its accuracy of simulating full scale gac filter performance huang et al 2019 nie et al 2020 yuan et al 2021 the gac came from core samples harvested from the full scale contactors feed water was prepared using water obtained from the plants immediately upstream of the gac spiked with variable concentrations ranging from 30 to 500 ng l of mib and geosmin the characteristics of the feed waters are listed in the si table s1 duplicate columns were fed with the feed water to evaluate the overall removal via both adsorption and biodegradation while the other two columns were fed with the feed water spiked with 300 mg l of sodium azide to suppress bacterial activity tests to confirm the effectiveness of azide without affecting adsorption can be found in yuan 2021 the biological activity of the gac samples were measured after each test to verify the sterility of the system fig s12 all the tests were run at the same ebct as that of the full scale water treatment plants shown in table 1 for 300 bed volumes to ensure reaching a pseudo steady state headspace free samples of influent and effluent were periodically collected to determine the contaminant removal fraction in the column which has been demonstrated to be similar to the expected removal rate at full scale when using this protocol huang et al 2019 a detailed description of the minicolumn test approach is shown in text s1 in the si 2 3 biological activity characterization methods biological activity of the gac samples was quantified immediately after the parallel column tests using adenosine triphosphate atp enzyme activity and 14c glucose respiration rate measurements atp was selected to determine the active biomass density for enzyme activity esterase and phosphatase were measured to quantify the metabolic activity of the biomass the 14c glucose respiration rate was tested to determine the organic substrate degradation potential of the biomass atp analyses for total cells on gac were performed using a luminultra deposit surface analysis kit fredericton new brunswick canada according to the manufacturer s instructions briefly 1 g of gac was lysed using a proprietary solution biomass extract was mixed with luciferase enzyme and analyzed for relative light units rlu using a luminometer the rlu of the sample was converted to an atp concentration using a calibration solution provided by the manufacturer enzyme activity esterase and phosphatase was measured using a method previously described in keon et al 2021 specifically sonication applied power 400 w was applied for 10 min to treat 50 ml of 50 mm tris buffer ph 8 0 mixed with 2 5 ml of bugbuster protein extraction reagent combined with 5 g of gac and the extract was then filtered using a 0 45 μ m pvdf syringe filter the esterase activity was determined by adding 1 6 ml of gac extract to 0 4 ml of 200 μm 4 methylumbelliferone acetate 4 mub acetate sigma aldrich mississauga on while the phosphate activity was measured using 0 4 ml of 200 μm 4 mub phosphate substrate the fluorescence of the sample at 0 min and 5 min was measured using an excitation and emission wavelength of 370 nm and 445 nm respectively the 14c glucose respiration method was modified from servais et al 1991 this approach measures the production of 14co2 resulting from the respiration of 14c glucose by the active biomass in gac samples the method was described in detail in yuan 2021 in brief 1 ml of the 14c glucose solution and 2 g of the gac sample were first mixed in a sealed vial then incubated in the dark for 3 h after incubation the microbial metabolism was stopped by injecting 0 5 ml of h2so4 the vial was purged for 10 min using nitrogen gas to extract the produced 14co2 which was subsequently trapped in 1 ml of naoh solution whose radioactivity was determined by a liquid scintillation counter beckman ls6500 2 4 batch tests batch tests were conducted to identify the potential biotransformation products of mib and geosmin in a gac contactor plant c gac and plant c gac influent water were used in the test since plant c gac was identified as that with the highest biodegradative capacity for mib and geosmin based on the results of the parallel column tests see section 3 1 test samples were prepared in triplicate by dosing approximately 60 mg l of plant c gac into 250 ml amber bottles which were filled headspace free with the water spiked with mib and geosmin mib and geosmin were added together to the water to an approximately initial concentration of 400 ng l for each compound using a milli q standard solution made from dry mib and geosmin chemical reagents purity 95 for both standards sigma aldrich on control samples were also prepared in triplicate by dosing the same amount of the gac and water without geosmin and mib into amber bottles all the bottles were tightly sealed with teflon lined caps and incubated in the dark at 37 c and blended on a rotary shaker at 100 rpm for 21 days 2 5 analytical methods the water samples of the parallel column tests were analyzed for dissolved organic carbon doc mib and geosmin concentrations doc was determined using a persulfate wet oxidation method as described in standard method 5310d apha awwa wef 2012 with an o i corporation 1010 toc analyzer college station texas usa mib and geosmin in water samples were pre concentrated using a solid phase micro extraction syringe fiber sigma aldrich canada and analyzed on a varian 3800 gas chromatograph coupled with a varian 4200 mass spectrometer the analysis was based on standard method 6040d apha awwa wef 2012 kaloudis et al 2016 d3 geosmin was used as an internal standard the method has a detection limit of 2 4 ng l for mib and 1 8 ng l for geosmin to identify the potential biotransformation products of mib and geosmin the 250 ml sample of the batch test was filtered using a 0 22 μm syringe filter and pre concentrated using 6 ml waters oasis hydrophilic lipophilic balance hlb solid phase extraction spe cartridges and eluted with 2 ml methanol which was analyzed by an ultimate 3000 high performance liquid chromatography system equipped with a hypersil gold c18 column 50 mm x 2 1 mm 1 9um thermo scientific on canada for chromatographic separation and a q exactive equipped with a hesi ii probe thermo scientific on canada data

resolution of 17 500 agc target of 3 10 5 and maximum injection time of 50 ms the known mib and geosmin biotransformation products were searched for and tentatively identified by chemical formula and accurate mass confidence level 4 proposed by schymanski et al 2014 using xcalibur qual brower thermo scientific on canada to identify potential unknown mib and geosmin biotransformation products non targeted screening was also conducted using compound discover 2 1 thermo scientific on canada by comparing the chromatograms of the test samples with geosmin and mib and control samples samples without geosmin and mib details are provided in the text s2 of the si 2 6 statistical analyses the null hypothesis being tested in this study is that the mib geosmin or doc removal is similar in the two types of gac e g sterilized vs unsterilized 4 c vs 20 c the comparison was made using a student s two sample t test at 95 confidence level the mean removal values of the minicolumn tests using two types of gac were compared with each other with the difference considered significant for t values greater than the critical two tail value since the sample size was not large 30 the normality of sample means was checked using q q quantile quantile plots 3 results and discussion 3 1 adsorption versus biodegradation in gac fig 1 summarizes the removal efficiency of mib geosmin and doc in the six gac samples harvested from three water treatment plants before and after sterilization we hypothesized that the difference in removal between the sterilized and unsterilized samples was due to biodegradation of mib geosmin and doc i e the difference between the blue and orange bars in fig 1 there was no significant difference p value 0 05 shown in table s4 between the performance of unsterilized gac and sterilized gac for plant a indicating that adsorption was the dominant mechanism for mib geosmin and doc removal with negligible biodegradation in contrast to plant a the mib and geosmin removals in unsterilized and sterilized plant b and plant c gac were found to be significantly different p value 0 05 shown in table s4 fig 1 a b showing that biodegradation of these compounds might play a role at these two locations the mib biodegradation rate i e the amount of contaminants that can be biodegraded within a unit of time in plant b gac was one order of magnitude lower than that in plant c gac table s5 possibly due to a lower number of mib degrading organisms and or lower biological activity in plant b gac conversely for geosmin the biodegradation rates were comparable between plant b and plant c table s5 these results suggest that gac biodegradative capacity could be very compound and site specific the presence of biodegradation in plant b and plant c gac is also supported by the doc concentration that exhibited significantly p values 0 0011 and 2 0 10 7 more decrease in the unsterilized than the sterilized gac fig 1 c namkung and rittmann 1987 suggested that mib and geosmin can be utilized as secondary substrates and co metabolized by microorganisms in the presence of primary substrates such as doc altogether these data suggest that effective mib and geosmin biofiltration might be occurring in the great lake region although its conditions of cold water temperature low organic loading and lack of ozone treatment prior to the gac were previously considered to be inhospitable for mib and geosmin biodegradation ho et al 2007 one potential reason for higher gac biodegradative capacity at these two locations is that both plants apply ultrafiltration prior to gac in this case the gac contactors are operating as postfilter adsorbers which require less frequent backwash and have extended filter run time the longer filter run time in the absence of backwash in plant b and plant c may allow more microbial acclimation or colonization on gac thus leading to higher biodegradative capacity additionally the higher toc concentrations of plant b and c influent water 5 5 6 mg l might provide more nutrients for microbial growth in contrast the lower natural organic matter nom loading 2 4 mg l of toc concentration and 0 026 cm 1 of uv254 in plant a might enable a longer adsorptive lifetime for plant a gac it is interesting to note that plant b gac was still able to adsorb over 80 of geosmin even after 9 years of operation this observation dispels the common belief that the gac in this region may be exhausted in terms of adsorptive capacity after 2 to 3 years of operation gillogly et al 1999 it was also unexpected to see that the mib and geosmin adsorption capacity of the plant a gac only deteriorated over the first three years but was relatively stable thereafter fig 1 a b for example the mib removal decreased from approximately 60 to 35 when gac age increased from one year to three years however its removal remained at around 35 in the gacs that are older than 3 years a possible explanation is the bioregeneration of the in service gac given the periodic occurrence of mib and geosmin in the source water the previously adsorbed mib and geosmin as well as the low molecular weight competitive nom might desorb from the carbon into the liquid phase due to a concentration gradient between the carbon and bulk liquid in the absence of algal blooms fig s9 newcombe et al 2002 aktaş and çeçen 2007 the desorbed substances might be further degraded by the microbial biofilm that was established on the gac surface after a long period of biological acclimation 3 years which enabled the previously occupied adsorption sites to regain adsorption capacity a similar trend was observed for doc removal in plant a gac fig 1 c which further indicates the presence of bioregeneration lu et al 2021 also observed that doc removal in gac gradually declined in the first 200 days of operation but reached a relatively constant value afterwards it can be argued that the similar removals of mib geosmin and doc in the parallel columns sterilized vs unsterilized showed a lack of biodegradation in plant a gac however the bioregeneration process might be extremely slow and requires a concentration gradient between the carbon and liquid phases for desorption aktaş and çeçen 2007 thus the instantaneous effect of bioregeneration could not be seen in the parallel column tests which had a very short retention time i e 10 min and a reversed concentration gradient however the proposed hypothesis cannot be validated based on the experimental data of this study more research is needed to explore this more fully 3 2 relationship between biological parameters and biodegradative capacity four biological parameters of the gac atp concentration esterase activity phosphatase activity and 14c glucose respiration rate were measured fig 2 to identify whether they might be reliable indicators of gac biodegradative capacity interestingly although it was found that plant a gac had negligible biodegradative capacity for mib and geosmin fig 1 the biological parameter measurements showed that there were some levels of biological activity in plant a gac a potential reason for this is the lack of mib degrading and geosmin degrading bacteria on plant a gac the 18 year old plant c gac which exhibited the highest mib and geosmin biodegradative capacity table s5 also had the highest atp concentration phosphatase activity and 14c glucose respiration rate pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to further examine if there were any relationships between the biological parameters and gac biodegradative capacity table 2 there was a significant correlation p value 0 05 between atp concentration phosphatase activity and 14c glucose respiration rate and the biodegradation rates of mib and geomsin in the gac samples tested however while the phosphatase activity in plant c gac at 0 005 μm g min was higher than that measured in the other gacs ranging from 0 0001 μm g min to 0 0004 μm g min fig 2 c it was at least two orders of magnitude lower than typical values observed in the bac that is installed after ozone where biological activity is greatly increased at 0 1 μm g min mckie et al 2020 this suggests that phosphatase activity might not be a sensitive tool to monitor the mib and geosmin biodegradative capacity of gac for doc biodegradation only 14c glucose respiration rate seemed to show a correlation table 2 this observation is different from those reported in previous studies mckie et al 2020 keon et al 2021 in which esterase activity was significantly correlated with doc removal in biofilters a potential reason for this discrepancy is that these studies mckie et al 2020 keon et al 2021 correlated esterase activity with overall doc removal efficiency which might include both doc adsorption and biodegradation instead of only biodegradation rate in summary the 14c glucose respiration rate appeared to be the best indicator for the gac biodegradative capacity of mib geosmin and doc 3 3 effect of temperature temperature is expected to exert different and sometimes opposing effects on the adsorption and biodegradation of mib and geosmin in gac contactors thus impacting the relative importance of the two mechanisms yuan et al 2020 typically higher temperatures result in a lower equilibrium adsorption capacity but a higher adsorption rate thomas 1961 zhdanov 1991 on the other hand higher temperatures tend to increase the rates of contaminant biodegradation due to enhanced microbial growth kovárová kovar and egli 1998 the utilities in this study experience a wide range of water temperatures from 0 5 to 20 c thus it is interesting to investigate the effect of temperature on the adsorption and biodegradation of mib and geosmin in gac at these locations for plant a and plant b the removal of mib and geosmin in unsterilized gac increased by approximately 15 25 and 20 35 respectively when the water temperature increased from 4 to 20 c blue bars in figs 3 a c and 4 a c a similar trend was observed for sterilized gac mib and geosmin removal increased by 13 31 with the increased temperature orange bars in figs 3 a c and 4 a c this observation agrees with previous findings by yuan et al 2020 mib and geosmin removal in a gac fixed bed adsorber increased by 20 30 as water temperature increased from 4 to 20 c because the difference in removal between the unsterilized and sterilized gac blue bars vs orange bars was typically less than 10 and it is assumed that adsorption played a dominant role in the removal of mib and geosmin in gac at the two locations thus based on the results it can be reasonable to conclude that higher water temperature could increase mib and geosmin adsorption in preloaded gac under conditions similar to plant a and plant b in contrast however for plant c gac an increase in temperature resulted in an insignificant effect on the adsorption of mib p value 0 52 and geosmin p value 0 059 orange bars in figs 3 d and 4 d the reason for this phenomenon is not fully understood it is possible that the effect of temperature on adsorption may become less significant as gac gets older i e when gac is heavily fouled with biofilm and nom such a hypothesis could also be supported by fig 4 a and b orange bars with increased temperature the geosmin adsorption increase in plant a 6 year old gac 15 was less than that in plant a 1 year old gac 35 as shown in figs 3 d and 4 d blue bars higher temperatures resulted in a slight increase in removal efficiency of mib p value 0 0012 but not geosmin p value 0 32 in unsterilized gac one potential reason for this is that biodegradation was the dominant removal mechanism for mib but not for geosmin in plant c gac higher temperature might increase the biodegradation rate of mib thus increasing its removal efficiency in unsterilized gac interestingly the higher doc removal mainly due to biodegradation in plant c gac was also observed at higher temperature fig s10 this observation is different from keon et al 2021 who found that temperature did not impact doc removal in biofilters between 10 and 23 c a potential reason for this discrepancy is that their investigated temperature range 10 23 c was higher than the temperatures tested in this study 4 20 c thus some bacteria may still be as active at 10 c as they were at 23 c however in our study bacterial activity might be greatly reduced at a lower temperature 4 c thus leading to a lower doc removal at 4 c 3 4 effect of influent concentration adsorption theory suggests that when a micropollutant is present at concentrations that are several orders of magnitude lower than those of a competing adsorbate e g geosmin and mib in the presence of nom the fraction of adsorption of the micropollutants across the gac is independent of its concentration gillogly et al 1999 graham et al 2000 nie et al 2020 the equivalent theory however has never been considered for the case of a biologically active bed of gac where both adsorption and biodegradation may be occurring in fig 5 the percentage removal of mib by adsorption alone the orange bars or by both adsorption and biodegradation the blue bars is similar for influent concentrations of 30 100 and 500 ng l p values 0 82 shown in table s4 in contrast for geosmin while the amount of adsorption remains approximately the same p values 0 67 shown in table s4 at different concentrations the orange bars the overall removal the blue bars increases by about 20 for the highest geosmin loading of 500 ng l 3 5 effect of empty bed contact time the ebct is a key parameter for gac filter design and operation and can potentially affect both the adsorption and biodegradation of geosmin and mib faruqi et al 2018 however the ebct might affect adsorption and biodegradation to different extents fig 6 shows that the adsorption of mib and geosmin in gac the orange bars increased by approximately 40 and 25 respectively as the ebct increased from 5 to 25 min however the overall removal of mib and geosmin by both adsorption and biodegradation the blue bars was not significantly affected by ebct p values 0 05 shown in table s4 the results show that biodegradation would contribute more to overall removal at lower ebct 5 min when there was less adsorption indicating that biodegradation was less affected by ebct than adsorption based on this observation it could be concluded that the robustness of a gac filter might be improved with the presence of active biofilm which enables the maintenance of a consistently acceptable overall mib and geosmin removal even at short ebcts 5 min drikas et al 2009 reported a similar observation a bac filter achieved over 99 of mib and geosmin removal efficiency even with an ebct of 5 min to analyze the kinetics of adsorption and biodegradation in gac zero first and second order kinetic models eqs 1 3 were applied to fit the experimental data of the parallel column tests at three ebcts 1 zero order kinetics c k e b c t c 0 2 first order kinetics l n c k e b c t l n c 0 3 second order kinetics 1 c k e b c t 1 c 0 where c is the effluent concentration of mib or geosmin ng l c 0 is the influent concentration of mib or geosmin ng l e b c t is empty bed contact time min and k is the reaction rate constant for mib and geosmin removal in sterilized gac all three types of models fit the data very well with adjusted r2 values which incorporates sample size over 0 85 table 3 however only the first order kinetic model showed an acceptable fit adjusted r2 0 7 for mib and geosmin removal in unsterilized gac possibly due to the inclusion of biodegradation ho et al 2007 also reported that pseudo first order kinetics could be used to model the biodegradation of mib and geosmin in biological sand filters huang et al 2021 proposed a service time model to predict the removal of mib and geosmin in a gac filter at different ebcts and gac service time which has a similar model form to the first order kinetic model based on this observation it is reasonable to conclude that the first order kinetic model might be a suitable tool to model both the adsorption and biodegradation of mib and geosmin in a gac filter as expected since both adsorption and biodegradation can occur in unsterilized gac the rate constants of mib and geosmin removal in unsterilized gac were higher than those in sterilized gac it is also interesting to observe that the rate constant for geosmin removal in sterilized gac was higher than mib removal in sterilized gac this implies that geosmin is easier to be adsorbed than mib which supports previous findings by graham et al 2000 the rate constant for geosmin removal in unsterilized gac was four times of that in sterilized gac in contrast the rate constant for mib removal in unsterilized gac was similar to that in sterilized gac this indicates that the presence of biodegradation in gac had a greater impact on the geosmin removal rate than the mib removal rate 3 6 potential biotransformation products identifying biotransformation products could provide insight into the metabolic degradation pathway and biodegradation mechanism in bac filters targeted and non targeted screening was used to search for known and unknown metabolites in the samples of the batch tests respectively the m z values for two known mib biotransformation products hydroxy 2 methylisoborneol and keto 2 methylisoborneol eaton and sandusky 2009 and two known geosmin biotransformation products ketogeosmin and hydrogeosmin eaton and sandusky 2010 were searched for but were not detected table s3 the studies that observed these transformation products conducted biotransformation experiments using pure bacteria strains while our study used the more complex ecology of bac which might have led to different metabolic pathways in the non targeted screening two potential mib biotransformation products were detected mib 153 c10h18o putatively identified as isoborneol and mib 197 c12h20o2 putatively identified as bornyl acetate table 4 table s3 it was proposed that mib could first undergo demethylation to form isoborneol c10h18o which was then transformed to bornyl acetate c12h20o2 with the addition of acetic acid however this is just a proposed biotransformation pathway since an accurate chemical structure of c10h18o and c12h20o2 could not be confirmed due to insufficient structural ms2 data as the signal intensity of the parent ions were too low for data dependent acquisition of ms2 data for geosmin only one potential metabolite was identified geosmin 201 c15h20 putatively identified as calacorene the intermediate products of geosmin biotransformation were not detected possibly because the geosmin biotransformation rate was very fast leading to the quick disappearance of intermediate products or the intermediate products may not have been released from the bacterial cells to the liquid phase although the exact chemical structure of identified biotransformation products could not be confirmed with strong evidence the result is quite promising since it is the first time that potential mib and geosmin biotransformation products have been tentatively identified in bac 4 conclusions the biodegradative capacity of mib and geosmin of in service gac harvested from three drinking water treatment plants in the great lakes region was evaluated using parallel column tests distinguishing between biodegradation and adsorption in the gac allowed the identification of a significant gac adsorption capacity for geosmin and mib even after more than 9 years of operation which dispels the common belief that the gac in this region may be exhausted in terms of adsorptive capacity after 2 to 3 years of operation it was also found that effective mib and geosmin gac biofiltration could be occurring at one site whose condition low organics cold temperatures lack of ozone prior to the gac was previously considered to be inhospitable for mib and geosmin biodegradation the 14c glucose respiration rate was identified to be a potential indicator for gac biodegradative capacity in terms of mib geosmin and doc the efficient mib and geosmin removal in gac filters was also observed under marginal conditions including low temperatures and low ebct suggesting that the presence of biofilm may increase the robustness of a gac filter the first order kinetic model was found to be a suitable tool to model both the adsorption and biodegradation of mib and geosmin in a gac filter several potential mib and geosmin biodegradation products in bac were identified using non targeted screening analysis of the high resolution mass spectrometer data which could provide insight into the metabolic processes in a bac filter the importance of this research is that it demonstrates the application of new tools to be able to differentiate the relative contributions of adsorption vs biodegradation across gac future research using these tools will help to define more cost effective operating protocols for gac that relies on both adsorption and biodegradation to meet treatment

16152,this study investigated the relative contributions of adsorption vs biodegradation towards 2 methylisoborneol mib and geosmin removal in the granular activated carbon gac harvested from six filter adsorbers in three drinking water treatment plants in the great lakes region column tests using azide treated sterilized and untreated gac in parallel were used to isolate the two effects it was identified that substantial mib and geosmin biodegradation in the gac was occurring in one location and that gac in some cases had significant adsorption capacity after as much as 9 years of operation four alternative biological parameters adenosine triphosphate esterase activity phosphatase activity and 14c glucose respiration rate were measured to quantify the biological activity of the gac and 14c glucose respiration rate was identified to be a potential indicator for gac biodegradative capacity in terms of mib geosmin and dissolved organic carbon several potential mib and geosmin biodegradation products were also identified using non targeted screening analysis by using the new tools identified in this study we can begin to better understand where adsorption vs biodegradation may predominate under real world conditions e g different temperatures influent concentrations and empty bed contact time leading ultimately to more cost effective use of gac graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords 2 methylisoborneol geosmin granular activated carbon adsorption biodegradation 1 introduction in the great lakes region utilities commonly install granular activated carbon gac in rapid filters gac filter adsorbers to remove micropollutants primarily for geosmin and 2 methylisoborneol mib from periodic algal blooms however the gac has a finite adsorption capacity and needs to be replaced before it is exhausted huang et al 2019 recently reported that gac filter adsorbers at a number of drinking water treatment plants in the great lakes region continued to provide a very good removal i e percent concentration decrease of mib and geosmin long after the gac would be assumed to be exhausted e g 6 years of service life furthermore the results suggested that the

different levels of biodegradation and therefore potentially incorrect conclusions shimabuku et al 2019 evaluated the adsorption and biodegradation of mib in gac by autoclaving the gac to inhibit biological activity however it is not known if autoclaving can inhibit biological activity without affecting the adsorption characteristics of the gac which could impact the validity of the results yuan et al 2022 to address these concerns a recent study conducted by the authors yuan 2021 tested different tools to differentiate adsorption from biodegradation of geosmin and mib across gac and reached the conclusion that continuously applying 300 mg l of sodium azide could effectively supress biological activity in gac without affecting the adsorption of geosmin and mib under conditions similar to those used in the present study we used this approach to investigate the mib and geosmin removal mechanisms across the gac harvested from three drinking water treatment plants in the great lakes region at all three locations the previous survey huang et al 2019 has observed that the gac that had been left in service beyond the expected lifetime of three years in this region could still achieve significant removals of geosmin and mib i e 60 geosmin removal after 6 years of operation the objectives of this study were 1 to understand whether the long term success of gac in the great lakes region was due to adsorption or biodegradation to report on the relative contribution of adsorption vs biodegradation on the in service gacs tested and to observe any correlations with service time 2 to examine potential correlations between biodegradative capacity i e the ability of gac to biodegrade a target compound such as mib or geosmin of the gac and some commonly cited measures of biological activity including adenosine triphosphate atp enzyme activity and 14c glucose respiration rate 3 to examine the effect of i water temperature ii influent concentration iii empty bed contact time ebct on the relative contributions of adsorption vs biodegradation across the harvested gac 4 to investigate the potential metabolic pathway of mib and geosmin in bac 2 material and methods 2 1 gac samples gac was harvested from six gac filter adsorbers in three drinking water treatment plants in ontario canada plant a uses coagulation and flocculation as gac pretreatment processes plant b uses coagulation and ultrafiltration and plant c uses ultrafiltration and ultraviolet uv disinfection the gac influent in the three plants covered a range of background total organic carbon toc from 2 4 to 6 0 mg l core samples across the whole depth of the gac contactors were collected during backwash using either a filter judge usabluebook plant a and b or after the gac contactors were drained using a homemade core sampler plant c the properties of the gac samples are listed in the table 1 the collected gac sample size distribution is shown in table s2 in the supplementary information si 2 2 parallel minicolumn tests to distinguish between adsorption and biodegradation in gac four glass minicolumns 2 54 cm internal diameter and 30 cm length were prepared in parallel all the columns were packed with 10 cm of gac positioned between two 10 cm layers of glass beads 1 mm in diameter to ensure plug flow hydraulics the minicolumn test protocol was adapted from gillogly et al 1999 and recently validated for its accuracy of simulating full scale gac filter performance huang et al 2019 nie et al 2020 yuan et al 2021 the gac came from core samples harvested from the full scale contactors feed water was prepared using water obtained from the plants immediately upstream of the gac spiked with variable concentrations ranging from 30 to 500 ng l of mib and geosmin the characteristics of the feed waters are listed in the si table s1 duplicate columns were fed with the feed water to evaluate the overall removal via both adsorption and biodegradation while the other two columns were fed with the feed water spiked with 300 mg l of sodium azide to suppress bacterial activity tests to confirm the effectiveness of azide without affecting adsorption can be found in yuan 2021 the biological activity of the gac samples were measured after each test to verify the sterility of the system fig s12 all the tests were run at the same ebct as that of the full scale water treatment plants shown in table 1 for 300 bed volumes to ensure reaching a pseudo steady state headspace free samples of influent and effluent were periodically collected to determine the contaminant removal fraction in the column which has been demonstrated to be similar to the expected removal rate at full scale when using this protocol huang et al 2019 a detailed description of the minicolumn test approach is shown in text s1 in the si 2 3 biological activity characterization methods biological activity of the gac samples was quantified immediately after the parallel column tests using adenosine triphosphate atp enzyme activity and 14c glucose respiration rate measurements atp was selected to determine the active biomass density for enzyme activity esterase and phosphatase were measured to quantify the metabolic activity of the biomass the 14c glucose respiration rate was tested to determine the organic substrate degradation potential of the biomass atp analyses for total cells on gac were performed using a luminultra deposit surface analysis kit fredericton new brunswick canada according to the manufacturer s instructions briefly 1 g of gac was lysed using a proprietary solution biomass extract was mixed with luciferase enzyme and analyzed for relative light units rlu using a luminometer the rlu of the sample was converted to an atp concentration using a calibration solution provided by the manufacturer enzyme activity esterase and phosphatase was measured using a method previously described in keon et al 2021 specifically sonication applied power 400 w was applied for 10 min to treat 50 ml of 50 mm tris buffer ph 8 0 mixed with 2 5 ml of bugbuster protein extraction reagent combined with 5 g of gac and the extract was then filtered using a 0 45 μ m pvdf syringe filter the esterase activity was determined by adding 1 6 ml of gac extract to 0 4 ml of 200 μm 4 methylumbelliferone acetate 4 mub acetate sigma aldrich mississauga on while the phosphate activity was measured using 0 4 ml of 200 μm 4 mub phosphate substrate the fluorescence of the sample at 0 min and 5 min was measured using an excitation and emission wavelength of 370 nm and 445 nm respectively the 14c glucose respiration method was modified from servais et al 1991 this approach measures the production of 14co2 resulting from the respiration of 14c glucose by the active biomass in gac samples the method was described in detail in yuan 2021 in brief 1 ml of the 14c glucose solution and 2 g of the gac sample were first mixed in a sealed vial then incubated in the dark for 3 h after incubation the microbial metabolism was stopped by injecting 0 5 ml of h2so4 the vial was purged for 10 min using nitrogen gas to extract the produced 14co2 which was subsequently trapped in 1 ml of naoh solution whose radioactivity was determined by a liquid scintillation counter beckman ls6500 2 4 batch tests batch tests were conducted to identify the potential biotransformation products of mib and geosmin in a gac contactor plant c gac and plant c gac influent water were used in the test since plant c gac was identified as that with the highest biodegradative capacity for mib and geosmin based on the results of the parallel column tests see section 3 1 test samples were prepared in triplicate by dosing approximately 60 mg l of plant c gac into 250 ml amber bottles which were filled headspace free with the water spiked with mib and geosmin mib and geosmin were added together to the water to an approximately initial concentration of 400 ng l for each compound using a milli q standard solution made from dry mib and geosmin chemical reagents purity 95 for both standards sigma aldrich on control samples were also prepared in triplicate by dosing the same amount of the gac and water without geosmin and mib into amber bottles all the bottles were tightly sealed with teflon lined caps and incubated in the dark at 37 c and blended on a rotary shaker at 100 rpm for 21 days 2 5 analytical methods the water samples of the parallel column tests were analyzed for dissolved organic carbon doc mib and geosmin concentrations doc was determined using a persulfate wet oxidation method as described in standard method 5310d apha awwa wef 2012 with an o i corporation 1010 toc analyzer college station texas usa mib and geosmin in water samples were pre concentrated using a solid phase micro extraction syringe fiber sigma aldrich canada and analyzed on a varian 3800 gas chromatograph coupled with a varian 4200 mass spectrometer the analysis was based on standard method 6040d apha awwa wef 2012 kaloudis et al 2016 d3 geosmin was used as an internal standard the method has a detection limit of 2 4 ng l for mib and 1 8 ng l for geosmin to identify the potential biotransformation products of mib and geosmin the 250 ml sample of the batch test was filtered using a 0 22 μm syringe filter and pre concentrated using 6 ml waters oasis hydrophilic lipophilic balance hlb solid phase extraction spe cartridges and eluted with 2 ml methanol which was analyzed by an ultimate 3000 high performance liquid chromatography system equipped with a hypersil gold c18 column 50 mm x 2 1 mm 1 9um thermo scientific on canada for chromatographic separation and a q exactive equipped with a hesi ii probe thermo scientific on canada data

resolution of 17 500 agc target of 3 10 5 and maximum injection time of 50 ms the known mib and geosmin biotransformation products were searched for and tentatively identified by chemical formula and accurate mass confidence level 4 proposed by schymanski et al 2014 using xcalibur qual brower thermo scientific on canada to identify potential unknown mib and geosmin biotransformation products non targeted screening was also conducted using compound discover 2 1 thermo scientific on canada by comparing the chromatograms of the test samples with geosmin and mib and control samples samples without geosmin and mib details are provided in the text s2 of the si 2 6 statistical analyses the null hypothesis being tested in this study is that the mib geosmin or doc removal is similar in the two types of gac e g sterilized vs unsterilized 4 c vs 20 c the comparison was made using a student s two sample t test at 95 confidence level the mean removal values of the minicolumn tests using two types of gac were compared with each other with the difference considered significant for t values greater than the critical two tail value since the sample size was not large 30 the normality of sample means was checked using q q quantile quantile plots 3 results and discussion 3 1 adsorption versus biodegradation in gac fig 1 summarizes the removal efficiency of mib geosmin and doc in the six gac samples harvested from three water treatment plants before and after sterilization we hypothesized that the difference in removal between the sterilized and unsterilized samples was due to biodegradation of mib geosmin and doc i e the difference between the blue and orange bars in fig 1 there was no significant difference p value 0 05 shown in table s4 between the performance of unsterilized gac and sterilized gac for plant a indicating that adsorption was the dominant mechanism for mib geosmin and doc removal with negligible biodegradation in contrast to plant a the mib and geosmin removals in unsterilized and sterilized plant b and plant c gac were found to be significantly different p value 0 05 shown in table s4 fig 1 a b showing that biodegradation of these compounds might play a role at these two locations the mib biodegradation rate i e the amount of contaminants that can be biodegraded within a unit of time in plant b gac was one order of magnitude lower than that in plant c gac table s5 possibly due to a lower number of mib degrading organisms and or lower biological activity in plant b gac conversely for geosmin the biodegradation rates were comparable between plant b and plant c table s5 these results suggest that gac biodegradative capacity could be very compound and site specific the presence of biodegradation in plant b and plant c gac is also supported by the doc concentration that exhibited significantly p values 0 0011 and 2 0 10 7 more decrease in the unsterilized than the sterilized gac fig 1 c namkung and rittmann 1987 suggested that mib and geosmin can be utilized as secondary substrates and co metabolized by microorganisms in the presence of primary substrates such as doc altogether these data suggest that effective mib and geosmin biofiltration might be occurring in the great lake region although its conditions of cold water temperature low organic loading and lack of ozone treatment prior to the gac were previously considered to be inhospitable for mib and geosmin biodegradation ho et al 2007 one potential reason for higher gac biodegradative capacity at these two locations is that both plants apply ultrafiltration prior to gac in this case the gac contactors are operating as postfilter adsorbers which require less frequent backwash and have extended filter run time the longer filter run time in the absence of backwash in plant b and plant c may allow more microbial acclimation or colonization on gac thus leading to higher biodegradative capacity additionally the higher toc concentrations of plant b and c influent water 5 5 6 mg l might provide more nutrients for microbial growth in contrast the lower natural organic matter nom loading 2 4 mg l of toc concentration and 0 026 cm 1 of uv254 in plant a might enable a longer adsorptive lifetime for plant a gac it is interesting to note that plant b gac was still able to adsorb over 80 of geosmin even after 9 years of operation this observation dispels the common belief that the gac in this region may be exhausted in terms of adsorptive capacity after 2 to 3 years of operation gillogly et al 1999 it was also unexpected to see that the mib and geosmin adsorption capacity of the plant a gac only deteriorated over the first three years but was relatively stable thereafter fig 1 a b for example the mib removal decreased from approximately 60 to 35 when gac age increased from one year to three years however its removal remained at around 35 in the gacs that are older than 3 years a possible explanation is the bioregeneration of the in service gac given the periodic occurrence of mib and geosmin in the source water the previously adsorbed mib and geosmin as well as the low molecular weight competitive nom might desorb from the carbon into the liquid phase due to a concentration gradient between the carbon and bulk liquid in the absence of algal blooms fig s9 newcombe et al 2002 aktaş and çeçen 2007 the desorbed substances might be further degraded by the microbial biofilm that was established on the gac surface after a long period of biological acclimation 3 years which enabled the previously occupied adsorption sites to regain adsorption capacity a similar trend was observed for doc removal in plant a gac fig 1 c which further indicates the presence of bioregeneration lu et al 2021 also observed that doc removal in gac gradually declined in the first 200 days of operation but reached a relatively constant value afterwards it can be argued that the similar removals of mib geosmin and doc in the parallel columns sterilized vs unsterilized showed a lack of biodegradation in plant a gac however the bioregeneration process might be extremely slow and requires a concentration gradient between the carbon and liquid phases for desorption aktaş and çeçen 2007 thus the instantaneous effect of bioregeneration could not be seen in the parallel column tests which had a very short retention time i e 10 min and a reversed concentration gradient however the proposed hypothesis cannot be validated based on the experimental data of this study more research is needed to explore this more fully 3 2 relationship between biological parameters and biodegradative capacity four biological parameters of the gac atp concentration esterase activity phosphatase activity and 14c glucose respiration rate were measured fig 2 to identify whether they might be reliable indicators of gac biodegradative capacity interestingly although it was found that plant a gac had negligible biodegradative capacity for mib and geosmin fig 1 the biological parameter measurements showed that there were some levels of biological activity in plant a gac a potential reason for this is the lack of mib degrading and geosmin degrading bacteria on plant a gac the 18 year old plant c gac which exhibited the highest mib and geosmin biodegradative capacity table s5 also had the highest atp concentration phosphatase activity and 14c glucose respiration rate pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to further examine if there were any relationships between the biological parameters and gac biodegradative capacity table 2 there was a significant correlation p value 0 05 between atp concentration phosphatase activity and 14c glucose respiration rate and the biodegradation rates of mib and geomsin in the gac samples tested however while the phosphatase activity in plant c gac at 0 005 μm g min was higher than that measured in the other gacs ranging from 0 0001 μm g min to 0 0004 μm g min fig 2 c it was at least two orders of magnitude lower than typical values observed in the bac that is installed after ozone where biological activity is greatly increased at 0 1 μm g min mckie et al 2020 this suggests that phosphatase activity might not be a sensitive tool to monitor the mib and geosmin biodegradative capacity of gac for doc biodegradation only 14c glucose respiration rate seemed to show a correlation table 2 this observation is different from those reported in previous studies mckie et al 2020 keon et al 2021 in which esterase activity was significantly correlated with doc removal in biofilters a potential reason for this discrepancy is that these studies mckie et al 2020 keon et al 2021 correlated esterase activity with overall doc removal efficiency which might include both doc adsorption and biodegradation instead of only biodegradation rate in summary the 14c glucose respiration rate appeared to be the best indicator for the gac biodegradative capacity of mib geosmin and doc 3 3 effect of temperature temperature is expected to exert different and sometimes opposing effects on the adsorption and biodegradation of mib and geosmin in gac contactors thus impacting the relative importance of the two mechanisms yuan et al 2020 typically higher temperatures result in a lower equilibrium adsorption capacity but a higher adsorption rate thomas 1961 zhdanov 1991 on the other hand higher temperatures tend to increase the rates of contaminant biodegradation due to enhanced microbial growth kovárová kovar and egli 1998 the utilities in this study experience a wide range of water temperatures from 0 5 to 20 c thus it is interesting to investigate the effect of temperature on the adsorption and biodegradation of mib and geosmin in gac at these locations for plant a and plant b the removal of mib and geosmin in unsterilized gac increased by approximately 15 25 and 20 35 respectively when the water temperature increased from 4 to 20 c blue bars in figs 3 a c and 4 a c a similar trend was observed for sterilized gac mib and geosmin removal increased by 13 31 with the increased temperature orange bars in figs 3 a c and 4 a c this observation agrees with previous findings by yuan et al 2020 mib and geosmin removal in a gac fixed bed adsorber increased by 20 30 as water temperature increased from 4 to 20 c because the difference in removal between the unsterilized and sterilized gac blue bars vs orange bars was typically less than 10 and it is assumed that adsorption played a dominant role in the removal of mib and geosmin in gac at the two locations thus based on the results it can be reasonable to conclude that higher water temperature could increase mib and geosmin adsorption in preloaded gac under conditions similar to plant a and plant b in contrast however for plant c gac an increase in temperature resulted in an insignificant effect on the adsorption of mib p value 0 52 and geosmin p value 0 059 orange bars in figs 3 d and 4 d the reason for this phenomenon is not fully understood it is possible that the effect of temperature on adsorption may become less significant as gac gets older i e when gac is heavily fouled with biofilm and nom such a hypothesis could also be supported by fig 4 a and b orange bars with increased temperature the geosmin adsorption increase in plant a 6 year old gac 15 was less than that in plant a 1 year old gac 35 as shown in figs 3 d and 4 d blue bars higher temperatures resulted in a slight increase in removal efficiency of mib p value 0 0012 but not geosmin p value 0 32 in unsterilized gac one potential reason for this is that biodegradation was the dominant removal mechanism for mib but not for geosmin in plant c gac higher temperature might increase the biodegradation rate of mib thus increasing its removal efficiency in unsterilized gac interestingly the higher doc removal mainly due to biodegradation in plant c gac was also observed at higher temperature fig s10 this observation is different from keon et al 2021 who found that temperature did not impact doc removal in biofilters between 10 and 23 c a potential reason for this discrepancy is that their investigated temperature range 10 23 c was higher than the temperatures tested in this study 4 20 c thus some bacteria may still be as active at 10 c as they were at 23 c however in our study bacterial activity might be greatly reduced at a lower temperature 4 c thus leading to a lower doc removal at 4 c 3 4 effect of influent concentration adsorption theory suggests that when a micropollutant is present at concentrations that are several orders of magnitude lower than those of a competing adsorbate e g geosmin and mib in the presence of nom the fraction of adsorption of the micropollutants across the gac is independent of its concentration gillogly et al 1999 graham et al 2000 nie et al 2020 the equivalent theory however has never been considered for the case of a biologically active bed of gac where both adsorption and biodegradation may be occurring in fig 5 the percentage removal of mib by adsorption alone the orange bars or by both adsorption and biodegradation the blue bars is similar for influent concentrations of 30 100 and 500 ng l p values 0 82 shown in table s4 in contrast for geosmin while the amount of adsorption remains approximately the same p values 0 67 shown in table s4 at different concentrations the orange bars the overall removal the blue bars increases by about 20 for the highest geosmin loading of 500 ng l 3 5 effect of empty bed contact time the ebct is a key parameter for gac filter design and operation and can potentially affect both the adsorption and biodegradation of geosmin and mib faruqi et al 2018 however the ebct might affect adsorption and biodegradation to different extents fig 6 shows that the adsorption of mib and geosmin in gac the orange bars increased by approximately 40 and 25 respectively as the ebct increased from 5 to 25 min however the overall removal of mib and geosmin by both adsorption and biodegradation the blue bars was not significantly affected by ebct p values 0 05 shown in table s4 the results show that biodegradation would contribute more to overall removal at lower ebct 5 min when there was less adsorption indicating that biodegradation was less affected by ebct than adsorption based on this observation it could be concluded that the robustness of a gac filter might be improved with the presence of active biofilm which enables the maintenance of a consistently acceptable overall mib and geosmin removal even at short ebcts 5 min drikas et al 2009 reported a similar observation a bac filter achieved over 99 of mib and geosmin removal efficiency even with an ebct of 5 min to analyze the kinetics of adsorption and biodegradation in gac zero first and second order kinetic models eqs 1 3 were applied to fit the experimental data of the parallel column tests at three ebcts 1 zero order kinetics c k e b c t c 0 2 first order kinetics l n c k e b c t l n c 0 3 second order kinetics 1 c k e b c t 1 c 0 where c is the effluent concentration of mib or geosmin ng l c 0 is the influent concentration of mib or geosmin ng l e b c t is empty bed contact time min and k is the reaction rate constant for mib and geosmin removal in sterilized gac all three types of models fit the data very well with adjusted r2 values which incorporates sample size over 0 85 table 3 however only the first order kinetic model showed an acceptable fit adjusted r2 0 7 for mib and geosmin removal in unsterilized gac possibly due to the inclusion of biodegradation ho et al 2007 also reported that pseudo first order kinetics could be used to model the biodegradation of mib and geosmin in biological sand filters huang et al 2021 proposed a service time model to predict the removal of mib and geosmin in a gac filter at different ebcts and gac service time which has a similar model form to the first order kinetic model based on this observation it is reasonable to conclude that the first order kinetic model might be a suitable tool to model both the adsorption and biodegradation of mib and geosmin in a gac filter as expected since both adsorption and biodegradation can occur in unsterilized gac the rate constants of mib and geosmin removal in unsterilized gac were higher than those in sterilized gac it is also interesting to observe that the rate constant for geosmin removal in sterilized gac was higher than mib removal in sterilized gac this implies that geosmin is easier to be adsorbed than mib which supports previous findings by graham et al 2000 the rate constant for geosmin removal in unsterilized gac was four times of that in sterilized gac in contrast the rate constant for mib removal in unsterilized gac was similar to that in sterilized gac this indicates that the presence of biodegradation in gac had a greater impact on the geosmin removal rate than the mib removal rate 3 6 potential biotransformation products identifying biotransformation products could provide insight into the metabolic degradation pathway and biodegradation mechanism in bac filters targeted and non targeted screening was used to search for known and unknown metabolites in the samples of the batch tests respectively the m z values for two known mib biotransformation products hydroxy 2 methylisoborneol and keto 2 methylisoborneol eaton and sandusky 2009 and two known geosmin biotransformation products ketogeosmin and hydrogeosmin eaton and sandusky 2010 were searched for but were not detected table s3 the studies that observed these transformation products conducted biotransformation experiments using pure bacteria strains while our study used the more complex ecology of bac which might have led to different metabolic pathways in the non targeted screening two potential mib biotransformation products were detected mib 153 c10h18o putatively identified as isoborneol and mib 197 c12h20o2 putatively identified as bornyl acetate table 4 table s3 it was proposed that mib could first undergo demethylation to form isoborneol c10h18o which was then transformed to bornyl acetate c12h20o2 with the addition of acetic acid however this is just a proposed biotransformation pathway since an accurate chemical structure of c10h18o and c12h20o2 could not be confirmed due to insufficient structural ms2 data as the signal intensity of the parent ions were too low for data dependent acquisition of ms2 data for geosmin only one potential metabolite was identified geosmin 201 c15h20 putatively identified as calacorene the intermediate products of geosmin biotransformation were not detected possibly because the geosmin biotransformation rate was very fast leading to the quick disappearance of intermediate products or the intermediate products may not have been released from the bacterial cells to the liquid phase although the exact chemical structure of identified biotransformation products could not be confirmed with strong evidence the result is quite promising since it is the first time that potential mib and geosmin biotransformation products have been tentatively identified in bac 4 conclusions the biodegradative capacity of mib and geosmin of in service gac harvested from three drinking water treatment plants in the great lakes region was evaluated using parallel column tests distinguishing between biodegradation and adsorption in the gac allowed the identification of a significant gac adsorption capacity for geosmin and mib even after more than 9 years of operation which dispels the common belief that the gac in this region may be exhausted in terms of adsorptive capacity after 2 to 3 years of operation it was also found that effective mib and geosmin gac biofiltration could be occurring at one site whose condition low organics cold temperatures lack of ozone prior to the gac was previously considered to be inhospitable for mib and geosmin biodegradation the 14c glucose respiration rate was identified to be a potential indicator for gac biodegradative capacity in terms of mib geosmin and doc the efficient mib and geosmin removal in gac filters was also observed under marginal conditions including low temperatures and low ebct suggesting that the presence of biofilm may increase the robustness of a gac filter the first order kinetic model was found to be a suitable tool to model both the adsorption and biodegradation of mib and geosmin in a gac filter several potential mib and geosmin biodegradation products in bac were identified using non targeted screening analysis of the high resolution mass spectrometer data which could provide insight into the metabolic processes in a bac filter the importance of this research is that it demonstrates the application of new tools to be able to differentiate the relative contributions of adsorption vs biodegradation across gac future research using these tools will help to define more cost effective operating protocols for gac that relies on both adsorption and biodegradation to meet treatment

16153,membrane distillation md is an acknowledged promising technology for desalinating hypersaline brine and as such can be a suitable candidate to further concentrate the seawater discharged from reverse osmosis process mineral scaling represents a major constraint against the application of md for further desalination of concentrated seawater especially when considering caso4 gypsum and nacl up until now it has been difficult to rely solely on membrane modification to mitigate caso4 scaling permeate side aeration can lessen caso4 scaling but does not permit to increase the water flux herein we proposed the synergy of feed side aeration and super slippery interface to perform concentrated seawater desalination via direct contact membrane distillation the results of this study show that this synergistic effect could significantly increase the water flux which was approximately 1 5 times higher in comparison to the membrane without aeration moreover the synergistic effect effectively alleviates the complex scaling of concentrated seawater achieving 90 wt water recovery rate based on the observed results we elucidated the mechanisms governing the enhanced water flux and scaling mitigation driven by the synergistic effect in addition we studied the optimal working condition for this system unveiling that low intensity large bubbles are more suitable as they lead to a better equilibrium between the economics and functionality of the process graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords aeration super slippery mineral scaling concentrated seawater membrane distillation 1 introduction seawater desalination offers an abundant and steady supply of fresh water where needed and is especially used in coastal countries with great access to salt water elimelech and phillip 2011 zhang et al 2021 politano et al 2017 amy et al 2017 reverse osmosis ro has been identified as the most energy efficient technology for seawater desalination considering that it accounts for more than 60 of the market share however the water recovery rate of ro is generally less than 50 in actual application in fact a large amount of concentrated seawater is actually discharged throughout the ro process which not only leads to a waste of resources but may also have a negative impact on the marine environment elimelech and phillip 2011 zhong et al 2021 zhu et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 on the other hand membrane distillation md is an acknowledged promising technology for desalinating hypersaline brine deshmukh et al 2018 boo et al 2018 huang et al 2017 xue et al 2021 and as such can be a suitable candidate to further concentrate the concentrated seawater in the md process the temperature difference between the hot feed stream and cold permeate stream results in a vapor pressure gradient which drives the water vapor across a microporous hydrophobic membrane until it condenses in the cool permeate stream lawson and lloyd 1997 woo et al 2018 bogler and bar zeev 2018 wang et al 2016 in addition md exhibits unique advantages when applied to the hypersaline brine that cannot be further processed by ro especially when compared with other mainstream desalination technologies such as multi effect distillation med and multi stage flash msf md is a modular technology and as such tolerates the dynamic nature of this market and requires overall lower capital costs compared to med and msf deshmukh et al 2018 despite the desirable features of md in regards to hypersaline brine treatment further desalination is still challenging membrane scaling that renders flux reduction and or membrane wetting constrains significantly against the efficient recovery of water from hypersaline brine christie et al 2019 horseman et al 2020 karanikola et al 2018 rezaei et al 2018 heterogeneous nucleation at the membrane feed interface is the major mechanism that drives the formation of mineral scaling during the heterogeneous nucleation process pre nucleation clusters can aggregate and adhere to the md membrane surface serving as growth sites to accelerate the precipitation of additional pre nucleation clusters rao et al 2020 yin et al 2021 rice et al 2020 horseman et al 2019 therefore the prevention of scaling can be achieved by increasing the pre nucleation clusters energy barrier on the membrane surface and or increasing the exchange rate between the bulk solution and the interface liquid including pre nucleation clusters and crystals nacl and caso4 gypsum are the two main responsible for the mineral scaling processes occurring during the desalination of concentrated seawater fortunately nacl scaling can be efficiently addressed using a super slippery super hydrophobic interface that increases the energy barrier for nacl nucleation on the membrane surface xiao et al 2019 zhu et al 2020 jiang et al 2020 zhu et al 2018 nevertheless caso4 scaling is still an important challenge which is difficult to tackle through the simple use of a super slippery interface su et al 2019 furthermore caso4 scaling leads to a great crystallization pressure onto the pore walls which is induced by crystal growth in the membrane pores and results in membrane wetting due to their expansion horseman et al 2020 yin et al 2021 recently some authors have reported that gas purging permeate side aeration can effectively alleviate caso4 scaling extending the membrane life and leading to an increase in water recovery rate horseman et al 2019 however increasing the water flux per unit time is beyond the function of the permeate side aeration and is actually detrimental for the possible role of aeration in reducing temperature polarization and concentration polarization in order to simultaneously increase the water flux and mitigate membrane scaling during md process we proposed the synergy of feed side aeration and super slippery interface for concentrated seawater desalination the results show that the synergistic effect could increase the water flux significantly approximately 1 5 times compared to the membrane without aeration and could additionally decrease the complex scaling of actual concentrated seawater achieving 90 wt water recovery rate we elucidated the mechanisms governing the enhanced water flux and scaling mitigation caused by the synergistic effect in addition we studied the optimal working condition for this system unveiling that low intensity large bubbles are more suitable as they lead to a better equilibrium between the economics and functionality of the process 2 experimental section 2 1 materials the

freshly prepared salt solutions as well as the actual concentrated seawater with complex components the nacl feed solution was prepared by adding nacl in deionized water until reaching an initial concentration of 7 wt the caso4 feed solution was prepared by mixing na2so4 and cacl2 in deionized water with an initial molar concentration of 14 mm for both ca2 and so4 2 ions su et al 2019

horseman et al 2020 rezaei et al 2018 the conductivity of the permeate solution will increase if the md membrane is wetted 3 results and discussion 3 1 surface morphology and wettability of the s pvdf membrane in this work the low surface free energy and high viscosity adhering sio2 nanoparticles of the pdms was exploited to reduce the membrane surface free energy and increase the surface roughness which are two mandatory conditions to obtain a super slippery super hydrophobic interface liu et al 2017 feng and jiang 2006 zheng et al 2010 yao et al 2011 ji et al 2021 the different morphologies of the pristine commercial pvdf membrane c pvdf and modified pvdf membrane with super slippery interface s pvdf were compared using sem and 3d laser confocal microscope sem images fig 1b and 1e show that the surface morphology of the s pvdf membrane was coarser than c pvdf membrane three dimensional laser confocal images fig 1c and 1f show that the relief of the s pvdf membrane from 12 to 20 μm was significantly larger than that of the c pvdf membrane from 4 to 2 μm due to the high roughness the s pvdf membrane surface exhibited super slippery properties boo et al 2016 zhong et al 2019 the water contact angle wca and water sliding angle wsa of the s pvdf membrane corresponded to 161 and 4 respectively fig 1d in contrast the wca of the c pvdf membrane was only 131 fig 1g in particular the sliding performance wsa 90 was significantly worse compared to s pvdf 3 2 membrane module design and synergistic effect on the nacl scaling fig 2 a shows the results of the nacl scaling experiment the initial water flux of the c pvdf membrane without aeration blue square was 14 4 l m 2 h 1 while said value declines over time because of membrane scaling upon carrying out this experiment evident scaling was observed on the sem image of the c pvdf membrane surface fig 2d the concentration factor defined as the ratio of the final feed concentration to the initial feed concentration was 1 64 fig 2b water recovery rate was 47 wt the initial water flux of the s pvdf membrane fig 2a dark yellow triangle 15 3 l m 2 h 1 was very similar to that of the c pvdf membrane although sio2 particles may block some of the membrane pores the super slippery interface can effectively reduce the temperature polarization and concentration polarization because of slip boundary effect su et al 2019 glen et al 2010 managing to compensate for the water flux loss in addition the water flux trend of the s pvdf membrane decreased slowly compared to the c pvdf membrane because of the relatively low degree of scaling on the membrane surface which is further confirmed by sem analysis and eds mapping fig 2e this result proved that the super slippery interface alone is able to mitigate the extent of nacl scaling comparing the c pvdf membrane with and without aeration the initial water flux for c pvdf a fig 2a red circle 23 1 l m 2 h 1 was substantially higher in respect of c pvdf 14 4 l m 2 h 1 demonstrating a relationship between the feed side aeration and the increase of water flux it is important to notice that the water flux of the c pvdf a decreased faster in the later period due to the higher concentration factor of 2 4 fig 2b as a result the water recovery rate of the c pvdf a was 80 wt therefore the c pvdf a is actually linked to a greater risk of scaling due to higher salinity compared with the c pvdf membrane however the sem image shows that the c pvdf a membrane surface was relatively clean upon completion of the nacl scaling experiment fig 2f evidencing that the aeration alone efficiently mitigates nacl scaling when the super slippery interface and feed side aeration were used at the same time s pvdf a the initial water flux was 21 9 l m 2 h 1 fig 2a black star and the concentration factor was 2 6 fig 2b water recovery rate was 85 wt in addition the sem image and eds mapping show that the s pvdf a membrane surface was clean upon completion of the nacl scaling experiment fig 2g evidencing that the synergistic effect efficiently mitigates nacl scaling in summary super slippery interface feed side aeration and synergistic effect all had great effect on alleviating nacl scaling despite the significant effect of aeration against nacl scaling the possibility to damage the membrane structure is an alarming drawback thus in order to exclude the impact of the nacl scaling on the mechanical properties of the c pvdf membrane the s pvdf membranes with and without aeration were selected for comparison fortunately the results of the tensile performance test fig 2c show that the stress strain curves of the s pvdf membrane with and without aeration were similar which proved that the aeration was responsible for negligible damage to the membrane structure 3 3 synergistic effect on the caso4 scaling fig 3 a shows the results of the caso4 scaling experiment following a similar trend to the nacl scaling experiment the initial water flux of c pvdf a 22 1 l m 2 h 1 and s pvdf a 21 9 l m 2 h 1 were significantly higher than those of c pvdf 16 9 l m 2 h 1 and s pvdf 16 0 l m 2 h 1 respectively this further supports the evidence that feed side aeration could significantly increase the water flux while the super slippery interface modification did not reduce the permeability of the membrane the effect of the super slippery interface and feed side aeration on caso4 scaling resistance can be analyzed from the trend of water flux and distillate conductivity as well as from the sem image of the membrane after the experiment as shown in fig 3a the water flux drop was observed for the c pvdf membrane with the lowest concentration factor 1 7 fig 3b a large amount of caso4 crystals deposited on the c pvdf membrane surface blocking the steam passage as it is observed from the surface sem micrograph of the membrane after experiment fig 3c and fig s5 at the same time the conductivity of the c pvdf membrane gradually increased as the water flux decreased because caso4 scaling could lead to a great crystallization pressure onto the pore walls due to the crystal growth in the membrane pores membrane wetting may occur following the expansion of these latter horseman et al 2019 horseman et al 2020 this conclusion is supported by the cross sectional eds layered micrograph and stress strain curve of the c pvdf membrane upon completion of the caso4 scaling experiment the cross sectional eds layered micrograph fig s6 and illustration in fig 3c shows that sulfur oxygen and calcium were distributed inside the membrane pores indicating that caso4 scaling occurs within the membrane pores compared with the pristine c pvdf membrane the stress strain curve of the scaled c pvdf actually confirmed the damage of caso4 scaling against the membrane matrix since the break point stress and the break point strain of the scaled membrane were obviously reduced fig s7 christie et al 2019 compared with the c pvdf membrane the water flux and conductivity trend of s pvdf was relatively stable within 24 h fig 3a demonstrating the effective capacity of this latter to mitigate caso4 scaling as a result the concentration factor of the s pvdf membrane was 2 1 with 52 wt of high quality water being recovered fig 3b however after the experiment needle like caso4 scaling can still be observed from the surface sem micrograph and corresponding eds mapping fig 3d because only few caso4 crystals were deposited on the s pvdf surface within 24 h the effect on the water flux was not significant a longer experimental time revealed the effect of caso4 scaling on water flux fig s8 in contrast the c pvdf membrane with aeration had better caso4 scaling resistance than the s pvdf the sem micrograph of c pvdf a at the end of the experiment does not show the typical needle like caso4 crystals deposited on the membrane surface fig 3e it should be emphasized that the concentration factor of the c pvdf a was 2 4 which is larger compared to the s pvdf membrane fig 3b hence the caso4 scaling resistance of the feed side aeration was better in respect to the super slippery interface however the calcium signal was still detected by eds implying the presence of caso4 pre nucleation clusters fig 3e when feed side aeration was combined with super slippery interface s pvdf a outstanding results were achieved in terms of caso4 scaling resistance as shown in fig 3f despite the concentration factor of the s pvdf a being the highest 2 5 fig 3b the calcium signal detected by eds was weak this demonstrated that the synergy of feed side aeration and super slippery interface leads to an effective mitigation of the caso4 scaling 3 4 synergistic effect on the concentrated seawater desalination the nacl and caso4 scaling experiments have shown that both the feed side aeration and super slippery interface could be effective in mitigating this phenomenon to a certain extent although the main scaling salts of the concentrated seawater are nacl and caso4 the composition of actual concentrated seawater is more complex thereby we further examined the anti scaling performance of the feed side aeration and super slippery interface on the desalination of concentrated seawater fig 4 a shows that the water flux of the s pvdf membrane decreases over time implying the presence of mineral scaling that blocked the steam channel the sem micrograph confirmed that a large number of mineral scaling was deposited on the s pvdf membrane surface fig 4d with the main component detected by eds being caso4 fig s9 therefore we chose calcium and fluorine the membrane matrix component is polyvinylidene fluoride atoms as representatives of mineral scaling and membrane matrix respectively after the experiment the atom percentage of calcium on the s pvdf membrane surface was 15 4 at at is atom percentage while the proportion of fluorine was 0 at fig 4d demonstrating that the membrane surface was completely covered by mineral scaling this result indicates that the super slippery interface alone is not sufficient to perform further desalination of concentrated seawater as shown in fig 4a the c pvdf a 22 7 l m 2 h 1 exhibited a higher initial flux than the s pvdf membrane 16 4 l m 2 h 1 which once more proves that the feed side aeration contributes in increasing the water flux as a result the concentration factor of c pvdf a with 2 3 was significantly higher than that of s pvdf with 1 6 fig 4b however the sem micrograph of the c pvdf a at the experiment completion revealed that a large amount of mineral scaling was deposited on the membrane surface fig 4e in the same fashion the proportion of fluorine on the c pvdf a surface was 0 at implying complete surface coverage by mineral scaling this means that the feed side aeration alone cannot be applied to carry out the further desalination of concentrated seawater in contrast the membrane surface of the s pvdf a at the end of the experiment was the cleanest fig 4f and fig s10 even bearing the highest concentration factor fig 4b 2 7 the proportion of calcium on the membrane surface was only 2 9 at fig 4f indicating that a lower amount of scale deposit was present correspondingly the proportion of fluorine on the membrane surface with 23 7 at was similar to that of the pristine s pvdf membrane with 29 1 at fig 4f and fig s11 this further proved that the degree of mineral scaling on the s pvdf a surface was relatively low according to these results the synergy of feed side aeration and super slippery interface could effectively mitigate the mineral scaling caused by the further desalination of concentrated seawater finally we tested the limiting recovery rate that can be achieved with s pvdf a fig 4c specifically the limiting water recovery rate was defined as the increase in the volume of the permeate solution per unit increase in the conductivity of the permeate solution the result shows that the s pvdf a recovered 90 wt of high quality water from hypersaline seawater bringing the concentrated seawater to a supersaturated state illustration in fig 4c 3 5 mechanism of water flux enhancement and scale mitigation according to the above experimental results we analyzed the mechanism of water flux enhancement and scaling mitigation derived from the synergy of feed side aeration and super slippery interface as shown in fig 5 a the stream on both sides of the membrane can be regarded as advection in a typical md process without aeration in such scenario temperature polarization and concentration polarization exist at the membrane feed interface due to heat loss and evaporation leading to water flux reduction deshmukh et al 2018 in contrast feed side aeration is able to reduce temperature polarization and concentration polarization the air pressed into the feed solution by the pump gathers to form large bubbles and then moves toward the membrane this process causes a reverse vortex in the flow field near the gas liquid interface surin et al 1983 moreover the burst of bubbles further increases the turbulence of the stream consequently the movement and bursting of bubbles increases the exchange between the interface liquid and the bulk solution and the temperature polarization and concentration polarization are significantly weakened leading in turn to enhanced water flux in fact the super slippery interface can also reduce the temperature polarization and concentration polarization due to the slip boundary effect however according to the experimental results the contribution of the super slippery interface to the water flux increase is much lower compared to the feed side aeration fig 5b explains the mechanism of the scale mitigation by synergistic effect feed side aeration can reduce concentration polarization by increasing the exchange between the interface liquid and the bulk solution which is also responsible for a reduction of interface nucleation in addition the vortexes caused by bubbles and bubbles bursting provide a strong shearing force on the membrane surface that washes away the pre nucleation clusters and crystals as a result feed side aeration can effectively alleviate mineral scaling scaling mitigation by a super slippery interface may be explained by evoking the increased energy barrier for heterogeneous nucleation the energy barrier of heterogeneous nucleation δ g h e t relates to the wetting characteristics of the membrane surface 2 δ g h e t f θ n w δ g h o m 1 4 1 c o s θ n w 2 2 c o s θ n w δ g h o m where δ g h o m is the homogeneous nucleation f θ n w is a wetting function θ n w is the contact angle of a nucleus on the membrane surface in water herein the nucleus is assumed to have aspherical cap geometry wu and nancollas 1996 eq 2 suggests that the homogeneous nucleation on an interface with higher θ n w is more difficult due to higher energy barrier horseman et al 2020 thereby the super slippery interface with wca of 161 and wsa of 4 bears better mineral scaling resistance in respect to the general hydrophobic interface with wca of 131 and wsa higher than 90 in addition because of the shorter hydraulic residence time and lower interaction force between the pre nucleation clusters crystals and the super slippery surface the former is more easily carried away by the feed stream especially by the vortex caused by feed side aeration 3 6 optimal working condition finally we provided the optimal working condition for this system by investigating the relationship between aeration intensity and water flux fig 6 shows that the water flux was positively correlated with the aeration intensity within the range where bubbles did not pass through the membrane pores less than 0 05 m3 h in this study while they became negatively correlated when the bubbles could pass through the membrane pores thereby there is a critical condition maximum water flux for aeration intensity that allows the bubbles to pass through the membrane pores when the aeration intensity exceeds the critical condition a large number of bubbles generated by aeration cross the membrane which not only reduced the vortex intensity but also increased the heat loss of the system thus leading to a decrease in water flux in order to prove this conclusion a verification experiment was performed using a nanofibers membrane method s1 in si with air permeability higher 6 5 mm s than that of the c pvdf membrane 1 5 mm s under the experimental aeration flow of 0 04 m3 h feed side aeration significantly decreased the water flux of the nanofibrous membrane fig s12 demonstrating that our conclusion is indeed correct large bubbles are more suitable for this system as they are actually beneficial due to the better economics and functionality of the process functionally the movement and burst of large bubbles can generate vortexes and sufficient shear forces to enhanced water flux and mitigate mineral scaling economically the production of large bubbles is easy especially compared with micro or nano bubbles for example this study used a cheap aeration stone as gas dispersion medium to prepare large bubbles the details about the bubble size distribution can be found in fig s13 in the si the large bubbles generated by the low aeration intensity keep the system in the optimal working condition thus the additional energy consumption and process cost required for feed side aeration were relatively low moreover the increased water flux and extended membrane life induced by feed side aeration could completely offset the energy consumption of aeration itself 4 conclusions we have successfully demonstrated that the feed side aeration combined with super slippery interface in md can significantly increase water flux and mitigate complex scaling of concentrated seawater at the same time among the main components of concentrated seawater scaling nacl scaling could be mitigated by feed side aeration or super slippery interface alone while caso4 gypsum scaling could be effectively mitigated by synergistic effect this synergistic effect could lead to a recover of 90 wt of high quality water from concentrated seawater in a short period in addition the large bubbles generated by the low aeration intensity keep dcmd system in the optimal working condition by this means the feed side aeration combined with super slippery interface is a system with low economic costs and powerful functions which is of great significance to the hypersaline brine desalination resource recycling and reducing

16153,membrane distillation md is an acknowledged promising technology for desalinating hypersaline brine and as such can be a suitable candidate to further concentrate the seawater discharged from reverse osmosis process mineral scaling represents a major constraint against the application of md for further desalination of concentrated seawater especially when considering caso4 gypsum and nacl up until now it has been difficult to rely solely on membrane modification to mitigate caso4 scaling permeate side aeration can lessen caso4 scaling but does not permit to increase the water flux herein we proposed the synergy of feed side aeration and super slippery interface to perform concentrated seawater desalination via direct contact membrane distillation the results of this study show that this synergistic effect could significantly increase the water flux which was approximately 1 5 times higher in comparison to the membrane without aeration moreover the synergistic effect effectively alleviates the complex scaling of concentrated seawater achieving 90 wt water recovery rate based on the observed results we elucidated the mechanisms governing the enhanced water flux and scaling mitigation driven by the synergistic effect in addition we studied the optimal working condition for this system unveiling that low intensity large bubbles are more suitable as they lead to a

distillation 1 introduction seawater desalination offers an abundant and steady supply of fresh water where needed and is especially used in coastal countries with great access to salt water elimelech and phillip 2011 zhang et al 2021 politano et al 2017 amy et al 2017 reverse osmosis ro has been identified as the most energy efficient technology for seawater desalination considering that it accounts for more than 60 of the market share however the water recovery rate of ro is generally less than 50 in actual application in fact a large amount of concentrated seawater is actually discharged throughout the ro process which not only leads to a waste of resources but may also have a negative impact on the marine environment elimelech and phillip 2011 zhong et al 2021 zhu et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 on the other hand membrane distillation md is an acknowledged promising technology for desalinating hypersaline brine deshmukh et al 2018 boo et al 2018 huang et al 2017 xue et al 2021 and as such can be a suitable candidate to further concentrate the concentrated seawater in the md process the temperature difference between the hot feed stream and cold permeate stream results in a vapor pressure gradient which drives the water vapor across a microporous hydrophobic membrane until it condenses in the cool permeate stream lawson and lloyd 1997 woo et al 2018 bogler and bar zeev 2018 wang et al 2016 in addition md exhibits unique advantages when applied to the hypersaline brine that cannot be further processed by ro especially when compared with other mainstream desalination technologies such as multi effect distillation med and multi stage flash msf md is a modular technology and as such tolerates the dynamic nature of this market and requires overall lower capital costs compared to med and msf deshmukh et al 2018 despite the desirable features of md in regards to hypersaline brine treatment further desalination is still challenging membrane scaling that renders flux reduction and or membrane wetting constrains significantly against the efficient recovery of water from hypersaline brine christie et al 2019 horseman et al 2020 karanikola et al 2018 rezaei et al 2018 heterogeneous nucleation at the membrane feed interface is the major mechanism that drives the formation of mineral scaling during the heterogeneous nucleation process pre nucleation clusters can aggregate and adhere to the md membrane surface serving as growth sites to accelerate the precipitation of additional pre nucleation clusters rao et al 2020 yin et al 2021 rice et al 2020 horseman et al 2019 therefore the prevention of scaling can be achieved by increasing the pre nucleation clusters energy barrier on the membrane surface and or increasing the exchange rate between the

significantly larger than that of the c pvdf membrane from 4 to 2 μm due to the high roughness the s pvdf membrane surface exhibited super slippery properties boo et al 2016 zhong et al 2019 the water contact angle wca and water sliding angle wsa of the s pvdf membrane corresponded to 161 and 4 respectively fig 1d in contrast the wca of the c pvdf membrane was only 131 fig 1g in particular the sliding performance wsa 90 was significantly worse compared to s pvdf 3 2 membrane module design and synergistic effect on the nacl scaling fig 2 a shows the results of the nacl scaling experiment the initial water flux of the c pvdf membrane without aeration blue square was 14 4 l m 2 h 1 while said value declines over time because of membrane scaling upon carrying out this experiment evident scaling was observed on the sem image of the c pvdf membrane surface fig 2d the concentration factor defined as the ratio of the final feed concentration to the initial feed concentration was 1 64 fig 2b water recovery rate was 47 wt the initial water flux of the s pvdf membrane fig 2a dark yellow triangle 15 3 l m 2 h 1 was very similar to that of the c pvdf membrane although sio2 particles may block some of the membrane pores the super slippery interface can effectively reduce the temperature polarization and concentration polarization because of slip boundary effect su et al 2019 glen et al 2010 managing to compensate for the water flux loss in addition the water flux trend of the s pvdf membrane decreased slowly compared to the c pvdf membrane because of the relatively low degree of scaling on the membrane surface which is further confirmed by sem analysis and eds mapping fig 2e this result proved that the super slippery interface alone is able to mitigate the extent of nacl scaling comparing the c pvdf membrane with and without aeration the initial water flux for c pvdf a fig 2a red circle 23 1 l m 2 h 1 was substantially higher in respect of c pvdf 14 4 l m 2 h 1 demonstrating a relationship between the feed side aeration and the increase of water flux it is important to notice that the water flux of the c pvdf a decreased faster in the later period due to the higher concentration factor of 2 4 fig 2b as a result the water recovery rate of the c pvdf a was 80 wt therefore the c pvdf a is actually linked to a greater risk of scaling due to higher salinity compared with the c pvdf membrane however the sem image shows that the c pvdf a membrane surface was relatively clean upon completion of the nacl scaling experiment fig 2f evidencing that the aeration alone efficiently mitigates nacl scaling when the super slippery interface and feed side aeration were used at the same time s pvdf a the initial water flux was 21 9 l m 2 h 1 fig 2a black star and the concentration factor was 2 6 fig 2b water recovery rate was 85 wt in addition the sem image and eds mapping show that the s pvdf a membrane surface was clean upon completion of the nacl scaling experiment fig 2g evidencing that the synergistic effect efficiently mitigates nacl scaling in summary super slippery interface feed side aeration and synergistic effect all had great effect on alleviating nacl scaling despite the significant effect of aeration against nacl scaling the possibility to damage the membrane structure is an alarming drawback thus in order to exclude the impact of the nacl scaling on the mechanical properties of the c pvdf membrane the s pvdf membranes with and without aeration were selected for comparison fortunately the results of the tensile performance test fig 2c show that the stress strain curves of the s pvdf membrane with and without aeration were similar which proved that the aeration was responsible for negligible damage to the membrane structure 3 3 synergistic effect on the caso4 scaling fig 3 a shows the results of the caso4 scaling experiment following a similar trend to the nacl scaling experiment the initial water flux of c pvdf a 22 1 l m 2 h 1 and s pvdf a 21 9 l m 2 h 1 were significantly higher than those of c pvdf 16 9 l m 2 h 1 and s pvdf 16 0 l m 2 h 1 respectively this further supports the evidence that feed side aeration could significantly increase the water flux while the super slippery interface modification did not reduce the permeability of the membrane the effect of the super slippery interface and feed side aeration on caso4 scaling resistance can be analyzed from the trend of water flux and distillate conductivity as well as from the sem image of the membrane after the experiment as shown in fig 3a the water flux drop was observed for the c pvdf membrane with the lowest concentration factor 1 7 fig 3b a large amount of caso4 crystals deposited on the c pvdf membrane surface blocking the steam passage as it is observed from the surface sem micrograph of the membrane after experiment fig 3c and fig s5 at the same time the conductivity of the c pvdf membrane gradually increased as the water flux decreased because caso4 scaling could lead to a great crystallization pressure onto the pore walls due to the crystal growth in the membrane pores membrane wetting may occur following the expansion of these latter horseman et al 2019 horseman et al 2020 this conclusion is supported by the cross sectional eds layered micrograph and stress strain curve of the c pvdf membrane upon completion of the caso4 scaling experiment the cross sectional eds layered micrograph fig s6 and illustration in fig 3c shows that sulfur oxygen and calcium were distributed inside the membrane pores indicating that caso4 scaling occurs within the membrane pores compared with the pristine c pvdf membrane the stress strain curve of the scaled c pvdf actually confirmed the damage of caso4 scaling against the membrane matrix since the break point stress and the break point strain of the scaled membrane were obviously reduced fig s7 christie et al 2019 compared with the c pvdf membrane the water flux and conductivity trend of s pvdf was relatively stable within 24 h fig 3a demonstrating the effective capacity of this latter to mitigate caso4 scaling as a result the concentration factor of the s pvdf membrane was 2 1 with 52 wt of high quality water being recovered fig 3b however after the experiment needle like caso4 scaling can still be observed from the surface sem micrograph and corresponding eds mapping fig 3d because only few caso4 crystals were deposited on the s pvdf surface within 24 h the effect on the water flux was not significant a longer experimental time revealed the effect of caso4 scaling on water flux fig s8 in contrast the c pvdf membrane with aeration had better caso4 scaling resistance than the s pvdf the sem micrograph of c pvdf a at the end of the experiment does not show the typical needle like caso4 crystals deposited on the membrane surface fig 3e it should be emphasized that the concentration factor of the c pvdf a was 2 4 which is larger compared to the s pvdf membrane fig 3b hence the caso4 scaling resistance of the feed side aeration was better in respect to the super slippery interface however the calcium signal was still detected by eds implying the presence of caso4 pre nucleation clusters fig 3e when feed side aeration was combined with super slippery interface s pvdf a outstanding results were achieved in terms of caso4 scaling resistance as shown in fig 3f despite the concentration factor of the s pvdf a being the highest 2 5 fig 3b the calcium signal detected by eds was weak this demonstrated that the synergy of feed side aeration and super slippery interface leads to an effective mitigation of the caso4 scaling 3 4 synergistic effect on the concentrated seawater desalination the nacl and caso4 scaling experiments have shown that both the feed side aeration and super slippery interface could be effective in mitigating this phenomenon to a certain extent although the main scaling salts of the concentrated seawater are nacl and caso4 the composition of actual concentrated seawater is more complex thereby we further examined the anti scaling performance of the feed side aeration and super slippery interface on the desalination of concentrated seawater fig 4 a shows that the water flux of the s pvdf membrane decreases over time implying the presence of mineral scaling that blocked the steam channel the sem micrograph confirmed that a large number of mineral scaling was deposited on the s pvdf membrane surface fig 4d with the main component detected by eds being caso4 fig s9 therefore we chose calcium and fluorine the membrane matrix component is polyvinylidene fluoride atoms as representatives of mineral scaling and membrane matrix respectively after the experiment the atom percentage of calcium on the s pvdf membrane surface was 15 4 at at is atom percentage while the proportion of fluorine was 0 at fig 4d demonstrating that the membrane surface was completely covered by mineral scaling this result indicates that the super slippery interface alone is not sufficient to perform further desalination of concentrated seawater as shown in fig 4a the c pvdf a 22 7 l m 2 h 1 exhibited a higher initial flux than the s pvdf membrane 16 4 l m 2 h 1 which once more proves that the feed side aeration contributes in increasing the water flux as a result the concentration factor of c pvdf a with 2 3 was significantly higher than that of s pvdf with 1 6 fig 4b however the sem micrograph of the c pvdf a at the experiment completion revealed that a large amount of mineral scaling was deposited on the membrane surface fig 4e in the same fashion the proportion of fluorine on the c pvdf a surface was 0 at implying complete surface coverage by mineral scaling this means that the feed side aeration alone cannot be applied to carry out the further desalination of concentrated seawater in contrast the membrane surface of the s pvdf a at the end of the experiment was the cleanest fig 4f and fig s10 even bearing the highest concentration factor fig 4b 2 7 the proportion of calcium on the membrane surface was only 2 9 at fig 4f indicating that a lower amount of scale deposit was present correspondingly the proportion of fluorine on the membrane surface with 23 7 at was similar to that of the pristine s pvdf membrane with 29 1 at fig 4f and fig s11 this further proved that the degree of mineral scaling on the s pvdf a surface was relatively low according to these results the synergy of feed side aeration and super slippery interface could effectively mitigate the mineral scaling caused by the further desalination of concentrated seawater finally we tested the limiting recovery rate that can be achieved with s pvdf a fig 4c specifically the limiting water recovery rate was defined as the increase in the volume of the permeate solution per unit increase in the conductivity of the permeate solution the result shows that the s pvdf a recovered 90 wt of high quality water from hypersaline seawater bringing the concentrated seawater to a supersaturated state illustration in fig 4c 3 5 mechanism of water flux enhancement and scale mitigation according to the above experimental results we analyzed the mechanism of water flux enhancement and scaling mitigation derived from the synergy of feed side aeration and super slippery interface as shown in fig 5 a the stream on both sides of the membrane can be regarded as advection in a typical md process without aeration in such scenario temperature polarization and concentration polarization exist at the membrane feed interface due to heat loss and evaporation leading to water flux reduction deshmukh et al 2018 in contrast feed side aeration is able to reduce temperature polarization and concentration polarization the air pressed into the feed solution by the pump gathers to form large bubbles and then moves toward the membrane this process causes a reverse vortex in the flow field near the gas liquid interface surin et al 1983 moreover the burst of bubbles further increases the turbulence of the stream consequently the movement and bursting of bubbles increases the exchange between the interface liquid and the bulk solution and the temperature polarization and concentration polarization are significantly weakened leading in turn to enhanced water flux in fact the super slippery interface can also reduce the temperature polarization and concentration polarization due to the slip boundary effect however according to the experimental results the contribution of the super slippery interface to the water flux increase is much lower compared to the feed side aeration fig 5b explains the mechanism of the scale mitigation by synergistic effect feed side aeration can reduce concentration polarization by increasing the exchange between the interface liquid and the bulk solution which is also responsible for a reduction of interface nucleation in addition the vortexes caused by bubbles and bubbles bursting provide a strong shearing force on the membrane surface that washes away the pre nucleation clusters and crystals as a result feed side aeration can effectively alleviate mineral scaling scaling mitigation by a super slippery interface may be explained by evoking the increased energy barrier for heterogeneous nucleation the energy barrier of heterogeneous nucleation δ g h e t relates to the wetting characteristics of the membrane surface 2 δ g h e t f θ n w δ g h o m 1 4 1 c o s θ n w 2 2 c o s θ n w δ g h o m where δ g h o m is the homogeneous nucleation f θ n w is a wetting function θ n w is the contact angle of a nucleus on the membrane surface in water herein the nucleus is assumed to have aspherical cap geometry wu and nancollas 1996 eq 2 suggests that the homogeneous nucleation on an interface with higher θ n w is more difficult due to higher energy barrier horseman et al 2020 thereby the super slippery interface with wca of 161 and wsa of 4 bears better mineral scaling resistance in respect to the general hydrophobic interface with wca of 131 and wsa higher than 90 in addition because of the shorter hydraulic residence time and lower interaction force between the pre nucleation clusters crystals and the super slippery surface the former is more easily carried away by the feed stream especially by the vortex caused by feed side aeration 3 6 optimal working condition finally we provided the optimal working condition for this system by investigating the relationship between aeration intensity and water flux fig 6 shows that the water flux was positively correlated with the aeration intensity within the range where bubbles did not pass through the membrane pores less than 0 05 m3 h in this study while they became negatively correlated when the bubbles could pass through the membrane pores thereby there is a critical condition maximum water flux for aeration intensity that allows the bubbles to pass through the membrane pores when the aeration intensity exceeds the critical condition a large number of bubbles generated by aeration cross the membrane which not only reduced the vortex intensity but also increased the heat loss of the system thus leading to a decrease in water flux in order to prove this conclusion a verification experiment was performed using a nanofibers membrane method s1 in si with air permeability higher 6 5 mm s than that of the c pvdf membrane 1 5 mm s under the experimental aeration flow of 0 04 m3 h feed side aeration significantly decreased the water flux of the nanofibrous membrane fig s12 demonstrating that our conclusion is indeed correct large bubbles are more suitable for this system as they are actually beneficial due to the better economics and functionality of the process functionally the movement and burst of large bubbles can generate vortexes and sufficient shear forces to enhanced water flux and mitigate mineral scaling economically the production of large bubbles is easy especially compared with micro or nano bubbles for example this study used a cheap aeration stone as gas dispersion medium to prepare large bubbles the details about the bubble size distribution can be found in fig s13 in the si the large bubbles generated by the low aeration intensity keep the system in the optimal working condition thus the additional energy consumption and process cost required for feed side aeration were relatively low moreover the increased water flux and extended membrane life induced by feed side aeration could completely offset the energy consumption of aeration itself 4 conclusions we have successfully demonstrated that the feed side aeration combined with super slippery interface in md can significantly increase water flux and mitigate complex scaling of concentrated seawater at the same time among the main components of concentrated seawater scaling nacl scaling could be mitigated by feed side aeration or super slippery interface alone while caso4 gypsum scaling could be effectively mitigated by synergistic effect this synergistic effect could lead to a recover of 90 wt of high quality water from concentrated seawater in a short period in addition the large bubbles generated by the low aeration intensity keep dcmd system in the optimal working condition by this means the feed side aeration combined with super slippery interface is a system with low economic costs and powerful functions which is of great significance to the hypersaline brine desalination resource recycling and reducing

16154,in this study a plant wide model describing the fate of c n and p compounds upgraded to account for on site off site greenhouse gas ghg emissions was implemented within the international water association iwa benchmarking simulation model no 2 bsm2 framework the proposed approach includes the main biological n2o production pathways and mechanistically describes co2 biogenic non biogenic emissions in the activated sludge reactors as well as the biogas production co2 ch4 from the anaerobic digester indirect ghg emissions for power generation chemical usage effluent disposal and sludge storage and reuse are also included using static factors for co2 ch4 and n2o global and individual mass balances were quantified to investigate the fluxes of the different components novel strategies such as the combination of different cascade controllers in the biological reactors and struvite precipitation in the sludge line were proposed in order to obtain high plant performance as well as nutrient recovery and mitigation of the ghg emissions in a plant wide context the implemented control strategies led to an overall more sustainable and efficient plant performance in terms of better effluent quality reduced operational cost and lower ghg emissions the lowest n2o and overall ghg emissions were achieved when ammonium and soluble nitrous oxide in the aerobic reactors were controlled

years the scarcity of natural resources and the concern about climate change have shifted the water sector paradigm therefore wastewater treatment plants wwtps are becoming water resource recovery facilities wrrfs this fact has promoted both the chemical and environmental engineering community and the water industry to widen the scope of these utilities to better understand and to design these new facilities plant wide modelling tools have become essential jeppsson et al 2013 wastewater treatment modelling researchers have integrated the main unit operations of a wrrf primary clarifier biological reactor secondary settler thickeners anaerobic digester dewatering unit etc to account for all the interactions amongst processes barat et al 2013 gernaey et al 2014 grau et al 2007 hauduc et al 2019 solon et al 2017 vaneeckhaute et al 2018 in view of simulating wrrf under different scenarios and of designing novel control strategies for a better performance plant wide wrrf modelling comprises chemical and physico chemical models to assess the new challenges of the wastewater treatment particularly precipitation models of common chemical compounds in wastewater hauduc et al 2015 kazadi mbamba et al 2016 2015b aqueous phase chemistry models flores alsina et al 2015 solon et al 2015 and mass transfer models amaral et al 2019 lizarralde et al 2015 have been proposed and calibrated to study different subprocesses of a wwrf in addition to the traditional activated sludge models asm based on biological processes batstone et al 2002 henze et al 2015 recently solon and co workers solon et al 2017 proposed a novel plant wide model capable of predicting the fate of phosphorus p in both water and sludge lines as well as the interactions with sulphur s and iron fe thanks to the implementation of comprehensive physico chemical process models this work combined a modified activated sludge model no 2d asm2d model with a speciation model routine to predict ph at each time step flores alsina et al 2015 this model evaluated and compared several energy and nutrient recovery strategies but without accounting for ghg emissions indeed ghg emissions should be included when evaluating the overall sustainability of control operational strategies for water resource recovery to add another important criterion in the multivariable space of performance assessment otherwise a good a priori control structure providing excellent effluent quality and lower costs could obtain this at the expense of high ghg emissions that are not being considered previous modelling studies have already included ghg emissions as a potential performance criterion when evaluating the sustainability of wwtps amongst the ghgs n2o emissions which have a 300 fold stronger global warming effect than carbon dioxide co2 ipcc 2013 have recently received a lot of attention several extensions based on asm models have been proposed in the literature to better describe n2o emissions during biological nitrogen removal domingo félez et al 2017 mannina et al 2016 massara et al 2018 ni and yuan 2015 pocquet et al 2016 however although some parameters of the models are ph dependent the evolution of ph in the different reactors is not predicted since the effect on ph of the processes taking place are not considered specifically the growth rate of nitrifiers depends on ph and consequently the n2o emissions produced by nitrifiers cannot be described accurately for several operational conditions su et al 2019 in addition co2 emissions are typically not accounted for since the evolution of inorganic carbon ic is not modelled however nitrifiers growth depends on ic availability guisasola et al 2007 torà et al 2010 wett and rauch 2003 zhang et al 2018 and its limitation could be significant in some scenarios one of the most used plant wide model that takes into account the ghg emissions is the bsm2g flores alsina et al 2011 several works in the literature have applied this model to study the effect on ghg emissions when implementing different control operational strategies barbu et al 2017 flores alsina et al 2014 2011 santín et al 2018 2017 sweetapple et al 2015 however bsm2g cannot describe the transformations and fate of p in the plant and moreover not all the known n2o production pathways are included in this model indeed n2o could be produced during the denitrifying phosphorus removal process liu et al 2015 hence a new model extension is needed to enable the evaluation of all the potential ghg emission sources when integrating the potential resource recovery mechanisms in wrrfs the current limitations of the previous approaches create the need to define a new extended benchmarking scenario bsm2 psfe ghg including biological cod n p removal ghg emissions and chemical and physico chemical models to evaluate resource recovery in wrrfs the main objective of the present work is to develop and evaluate this bsm2 psfe ghg plant wide benchmarking scenario by integrating i the biological model asm2d n2o proposed by massara et al 2018 accounting for both enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr and the most recently reported n2o production pathways ii potential sources of ghg emissions through the wrrf updated from flores alsina et al 2011 iii plant wide modelling of detailed p chemical processes solon et al 2017 and iv development of novel control strategies based on nitrite and nitrous oxide sensors to mitigate n2o emissions once the development of the bsm2 psfe ghg sub models and their interfaces is detailed simulations will help to understand how novel nutrient recovery control strategies can affect ghg emissions in a plant wide context in this sense this work aims at i studying the effect on ghg emissions when implementing nutrient recovery control strategies and ii designing and implementing novel control operational strategies to optimise plant performance while reducing the ghg emissions 2 material and methods 2 1 bsm2 psfe ghg description 2 1 1 biological models the asm2d psfe n2o model defined in this work merges the bsm2 psfe approach of solon et al 2017 and the asm2d n2o model of massara et al 2018 that has been successfully applied to describe n2o emissions in full scale wwtps solís et al 2022 hence asm2d psfe n2o describes simultaneous biological c n and p removal as well as the chemical and biological processes related to s and fe and n2o production and emission therefore asm2d psfe n2o presents five new state variables compared to the bsm2 psfe model i e sno2 sno sn2o snh2oh and xnob the n2o biological pathways adapted from massara et al 2018 are 1 nh2oh oxidation pathway nn pathway n2o is produced from the reduction of no by the enzyme nor of aob coupled with the oxidation of nh2oh to no2 pocquet et al 2016 2 aob nitrifier denitrification pathway nd pathway n2o is produced from no2 reduction to no and subsequently to n2o by aob these two processes are lumped in one single reaction as in pocquet et al 2016 3 heterotrophic denitrification pathway den pathway n2o is produced as an intermediate of the denitrification processes either by oho or pao hiatt and grady 2008 the three biological n2o production pathways were included in the asm2d psfe n2o model to account for all the known biological n2o production pathways and to fairly assess the contribution of each pathway under dynamic conditions and under the different control operational strategies implemented the stoichiometric matrix and the continuity verification of the modified asm2d psfe n2o model were calculated as in hauduc et al 2010 and are provided in the supplementary information section the anaerobic digestion model adm implemented is an extension of the adm1 model batstone et al 2002 reproducing the biological and chemical interactions between p s and fe as reported in previous works flores alsina et al 2016 solon et al 2017 the kinetic parameters of both models can be obtained from the software implementation or from the original sub models flores alsina et al 2016 massara et al 2018 solon et al 2017 2 1 2 physico chemical models pcms bsm2 psfe ghg embraces three different pcms as proposed in the bsm2 psfe approach solon et al 2017 the ph and ion speciation pairing model aqueous phase chemistry model the multiple mineral precipitation mmp model and the gas liquid mass transfer model 2 1 2 1 ph and ion speciation pairing a general aqueous phase chemistry model is used in both asm and adm describing the ph variation and ion pairing at each time step flores alsina et al 2015 solon et al 2015 the aqueous phase chemistry model corrects for ionic strength via the davies approach for chemical activity solon et al 2017 the acid base parameters and the activity coefficients are temperature dependent and all calculations are performed under non ideal conditions the acid base equilibria are described as a set of implicit algebraic equations and solved at each integration step of the ordinary differential equation solver the species concentrations take part in the biological and physico chemical processes a more detailed description of the aqueous phase chemistry model can be found in flores alsina et al 2015 and solon et al 2015 the integration of the ph and ion speciation allows to account for weak acid base conditions within the n2o production processes since the growth rates of nitrifiers xaob and xnob are functions of their substrates i e free ammonia fa nh3 and free nitrous acid fna hno2 respectively 2 1 2 2 multiple mineral precipitation mmp the precipitation equations are integrated as temperature dependent reversible processes with the saturation index si as the chemical driving force stumm and morgan 1996 the si was calculated by comparing the multiplication of the chemical activities of the dissolved ions of each mineral with its solubility product for a given aqueous phase three conditions can occur kazadi mbamba et al 2015a i si 0 the aqueous phase is undersaturated and the mineral is dissolved ii si 0 the aqueous phase is at equilibrium or iii si 0 the aqueous phase is oversaturated and chemical precipitation may occur the precipitation rate depends on the kinetic rate coefficient the species concentration the mineral solid phase and the order of the reaction kazadi mbamba et al 2015a 2015b solon et al 2017 the mmp model includes the most likely minerals to precipitate during wastewater treatment calcite caco3 hydroxyapatite ca5 po4 3 oh amorphous calcium phosphate ca3 po4 2 struvite mgnh4po4 6h20 k struvite mgkpo4 6h20 newberyite mghpo4 3h20 magnesite mgco3 and iron sulphide fes the simplified approach of hauduc et al 2015 is implemented to describe the precipitation of hydrous ferric oxides hfos the phosphate adsorption and phosphate co precipitation to better estimate the phosphorus chemical precipitation 2 1 2 3 gas liquid transfer the gas liquid transfer processes are described for the gas components co2 o2 no n2o n2 and h2s the gas liquid transfer is based on fick s first law eq 1 which states that the transfer rate ρ i is proportional to the global mass transfer coefficient k l a i and the driving force is the difference between the saturation concentration and the concentration of the gas in the liquid phase the saturation concentration is calculated through henry s law which states that there is a proportionality kh i between the saturation concentration of the gas dissolved in the liquid and the partial pressure of the gas pi 1 ρ i k l a i k h i p i c i the mass transfer coefficient for each gas i co2 o2 no n2o n2 and h2s is calculated from eq 2 as the square root of the ratio of the diffusivities of the gaseous component in the liquid di to that of oxygen do2 and proportional to the mass transfer coefficient of the reference compound oxygen lizarralde et al 2015 2 k l a i k l a o 2 d i d o 2 1 2 the gas liquid transfer processes in adm are included for the following gas components h2o co2 h2 ch4 and h2s and are implemented as described by batstone et al 2002 2 2 model integration the different sub models asm2d psfe n2o adm and pcms in bsm2 psfe ghg were integrated using model interfaces the asm adm and adm asm interfaces are based on the continuity based interfacing method nopens et al 2009 to ensure elemental mass and charge conservation the interfaces consider instantaneous processes i e processas ad and state variable conversions i e convas ad the asm adm interface processas ad involves 1 the removal of cod demanding

involved processes and conversion can be found in flores alsina et al 2016 finally the pcms integration into asm and adm models was made following the procedures detailed in the original works flores alsina et al 2015 solon et al 2017 2015 2 3 plant layout and ancillary processes bsm2 psfe ghg was implemented in the same plant layout as the bsm2 psfe solon et al 2017 the wrrf consists of a primary clarifier prim an activated sludge section as a secondary clarifier sec a sludge thickener thk an anaerobic digester ad a dewatering unit dew and finally a storage tank st fig 1 additional models were considered to simulate the ancillary processes prim sec thk dew and st the prim 900 m3 was modelled according to otterpohl and freund 1992 with different settling velocities for biodegradable and non biodegradable compounds wentzel et al 2006 the as had an a2 o configuration consisting of 7 tanks in series tanks 1 and 2 were anaerobic anaer1 and anaer2 with a total volume of 2000 m3 tanks 3 and 4

modelled according to the double exponential settling velocity function of takács et al 1991 in a ten layer one dimensional settler the thk and dew units were modelled as ideal units with no biological activity and a constant percentage of tss in the concentrated sludge flows the ad had a working volume of 3400 m3 and a headspace volume of 300 m3 the st was modelled as a non reactive ideally mixed tank of 160 m3 additional information about the plant design and default operational conditions can be found in gernaey et al 2014 and solon et al 2017 the influent was generated following the principles proposed by gernaey et al 2011 finally the sensors and actuators were modelled with response time delay and white noise to avoid creating unrealistic control applications rieger et al 2003 2 4 estimation of ghg emissions different ghg compounds co2 ch4 and n2o type of emissions biogenic and non biogenic and sources of emissions direct or indirect were accounted for in bsm2 psfe ghg estimates not explicitly calculated by the sub models were estimated following the comprehensive methodology suggested by flores alsina et al 2014 2011 the different sources of ghg emissions considered throughout the wrrf are direct secondary treatment ghg emissions co2 generated from biomass respiration co2 generated from bod5 oxidation co2 credit from nitrification and n2o generated during biological n removal co2 emissions are explicitly accounted for by asm2d psfe n2o and pcms i e ph and ion speciation pairing and gas liquid transfer models by including ic instead of alkalinity as a state variable flores alsina et al 2015 n2o generated via the nn and nd pathways of aob and den pathway of heterotrophic organisms massara et al 2018 sludge processing ghg emissions ghg emissions during sludge processing are generated in the anaerobic digester co2 and ch4 emissions are explicitly calculated by the modified adm1 model flores alsina et al 2016 solon et al 2017 fugitive emissions from ad and co generation units are included as a total of 2 7 of the produced biogas that was slipped and un combusted magnus arnell 2016 the remaining biogas is combusted in the gas engine turbine and all the ch4 is converted to co2 generating electricity and heat the co2 produced in the ad and the co2 produced in the combustion are released into the atmosphere finally dissolved ch4 and h2 in the digester effluent is assumed to be fully stripped in the following process units and emitted to the atmosphere these emissions are accounted for in the ad important to maintain mass balances potential n2o emissions due to denitrification downstream of the ad unit oshita et al 2014 were not considered since the dew unit was modelled as a non reactive unit moreover it should be noted that neither no3 nor no2 were present in the ad net power related ghg emissions net power is the difference between energy consumption and production energy production is the electricity produced by the ad turbine and it is calculated using a factor for the energy content of ch4 50 014 mj kg ch4 1 and assuming an efficiency of 43 for electricity generation flores alsina et al 2011 energy consumption involves pumping mixing aeration and heating and is calculated using the operational cost index oci see section 2 5 a value of 0 359 kg co2 kwh 1 is selected for the co2 emission from net power production european production mix iea 2011 embedded ghg emissions from chemicals use the possible addition of chemicals in the wrrf produces embedded indirect ghg emissions the specific chemicals considered are i methanol dosage as external carbon source with a static factor of 1 54 kg co2 kg methanol 1 flores alsina et al 2011 ii fecl3 for p precipitation 0 16 kg co2 kg fecl3 1 iii naoh to raise the ph 1 24 kg co2 kg naoh 1 and iv mg oh 2 to favour the struvite precipitation 1 17 kg co2 kg mg oh 2 1 gustavsson and tumlin 2013 ghg emissions from effluent disposal n2o is produced in the receiving effluent due to the partial conversion of the remaining tn an emission factor of 5 g per kg tn discharged to recipient is obtained from the n2o emissions corresponding to disposal in lakes and rivers arnell 2016 sludge storage disposal and reuse direct emissions from sludge storage are estimated by assuming uncovered storage for 12 months as 8 68 kg ch4 per ton of vs and 1 1 of tn in sludge emitted as n2o arnell 2016 after the sludge storage it is transported for disposal and reuse causing indirect emissions of co2 ch4 and n2o the co2 emissions associated with the transport of biosolids are quantified by multiplying the truck movements by the distance of reuse co2 emissions from mineralization are calculated based on the sludge mass multiplied by the carbon concentration and the conversion factor from c to co2 n2o emissions are calculated based on a static factor of 0 01 kg n n2o per kg of tn in total three different sludge disposal alternatives are included agriculture 38 sludge disposal 150 km from the wrrf compost 45 sludge 20 km and forestry 17 sludge 144 km arnell 2016 bridle et al 2008 flores alsina et al 2011 finally all ghg emissions are converted into units of co2 equivalents co2e by the global warming potentials gwp the gwp for a 100 year time horizon for n2o and ch4 are 298 kg co2e per kg n2o and 34 kg co2e per kg ch4 respectively ipcc 2013 additional details on the implementation of ghg emissions can be found in section 6 2 5 evaluation criteria three performance indices were used to assess the plant performance for the different control operational strategies besides the classical evaluation criteria based on the effluent quality index eqi and the oci gernaey et al 2014 nopens et al 2010 total ghg emissions in co2e were added as an additional criterion as first proposed by flores alsina et al 2014 this value enables the understanding of the synergies and trade offs that different nutrient recovery control strategies can have on overall ghg emissions on the other hand eqi kg pollution units d 1 represents the overall pollution leaving the plant and is calculated with eq 3 as a weighted sum of effluent

gernaey et al 2014 and solon et al 2017 finally other legal criteria such as the percentage of time the plant is in violation tiv i e when effluent concentrations are above discharge limits for selected nutrients in the effluent were also used to evaluate the plant performance 2 6 control strategies table 1 summarises the individual controllers and control strategies combining different controllers that were applied in this work figures s1 s5 supplementary information section show the schematics of the control loops implemented in each control strategy the default scenario a0 is the open loop configuration gernaey et al 2014 thus the air flow rate supplied to the aerobic reactors value of the mass transfer coefficient kla and the purge flow rate were kept constant the performance of each implemented control strategy is evaluated by comparison with a0 by means of the evaluation criteria indices the control strategies a1 to a3 are based on the improvement of the water quality reduction of eqi and tiv for n and p species by optimizing the aeration strategy the sludge age in winter or by including nutrient recovery finally the control strategies a4 and a5 are mainly focused on reducing the ghg emissions while maintaining good effluent quality and low operating costs all dynamic simulations 609 days are preceded by a steady state simulation 300 days but only data generated during the last 364 days of dynamic simulations are used to evaluate the implemented control strategies the sensors characteristics applied in the implemented control strategies are summarized in section s2 3 results 3 1 steady state simulations fig 1 shows the total ghg emissions combined with the fractionation of ghg emissions on plant and off plant and the overall and individual mass balances for c n and p as well as the ph under steady state conditions for the a0 scenario amongst the total ghg emissions 65 consisted of co2 of which 63 of the total co2 emissions was biogenic co2 emitted in the biotreatment 29 of n2o 21 of the total n2o emitted was produced in the biotreatment section through n removal and 6 of ch4 the low ch4 emissions were due to all the produced ch4 in the ad was burnt in the gas engine unit and therefore transformed to co2 and energy most of the ghg emissions were direct emissions 80 i e produced in the wrrf the predicted indirect ghg emissions were mainly produced due to sludge disposal and reuse since the co2 emissions produced due to electricity production were mitigated from the electricity generated in the cogeneration unit of ch4 and no imbedded ghg emissions from chemicals use were produced regarding the fate of c the inlet c ends up in three different forms i 51 3 is emitted as co2 32 8 in the as section as biogenic co2 due to the organic matter oxidation and biomass respiration and 18 5 as combustion and leakages of biogas in the ad this represents 38 7 of the inlet c to the digester ii 23 1 is dissolved in the effluent mainly in the form of sic 80 and si 13 4 and iii 25 5 is disposed of in the sludge as particulate organics and biomass in the case of n the inlet n ends up in three different phases i 49 is discharged in the effluent mainly as sno3 31 4 and dissolved sn2 56 5 ii 21 4 ends up in the gas phase of the biological reactors mainly as n2 but with 1 0 of the inlet n as nn2o which is within the ranges reported by massara et al 2017 and ahn et al 2010 who obtained values of 0 3 3 of n2o emission in 12 different wwtps and iii the remaining 29 6 of the inlet n is disposed in the sludge mainly as biomass and entrapped in particulate organics one important outcome of this a0 operation is its feasibility to accomplish n removal despite its lack of active control since the values of tkn 2 8 g n m 3 and tn 11 0 g n m 3 in the effluent for a0 are below the bsm discharge limits tknlimit 4 g n m 3 tnlimit 18 g n m 3 the analysis of this scenario also shows the important effects of some recycled streams such as the overflows of the thickener and the dewatering unit which increase the n influent load to the plant by 21 5 regarding the p results only 22 3 of the influent p leaves the plant through the water line mainly as soluble orthophosphate spo4 43 6 and xpp 39 7 that overflows in the secondary settler the obtained effluent tp concentration is 2 37 g p m 3 above the bsm discharge limit of tplimit 2 0 g p m 3 the remaining 77 7 of inlet p remain in the waste sludge pointing out the possibility of recovering p from the anaerobic digestate moreover the recycles of the thickener overflows and the reject water 7 7 and 229 9 kg p d 1 respectively increase the influent p load by 95 3 2 dynamic simulations the dynamic simulation results of the default a0 scenario and the runs with implemented control strategies a1 a5 are summarized in table 2 in the case of a0 22 5 of the total ghg emissions come from n2o during biological n removal which represents a n2o emission factor n2o ef of 2 10 this emission factor could be reduced by analysing which biological pathways are producing most of the n2o and then designing adequate mitigation strategies table 2 also shows that the effluent obtained is acceptable in terms of effluent average concentrations during the evaluated period however the percentages of tiv for ammonium and p are high 35 3 and 40 5 respectively and thus there is a niche for a performance improvement using control strategies in the following sections the results for each implemented control strategy table 1 are presented and discussed the ghg emissions and the overall and individual mass balances q c n and p and ph for the main streams of the wrrf for each control strategy are reported in sections s3 and s4 supplementary information section 3 2 1 control strategy a1 ammonium cascade waste controller the a1 control strategy involves three controllers the first two control loops include two controllers following a cascade configuration currently known as aeration based ammonium controller abac in this configuration the do controller of the secondary feedback control loop is in charge of maintaining the do concentration in aer2 by manipulating the aeration flow kla value while the primary feedback control loop manipulates the do set point in aer2 using the ammonium concentration in aer2 as the controlled variable the ammonium set point in aer2 reactor is fixed at 2 g n m 3 an additional control loop acts on the purge flow qw to maintain the desired xtss concentration in aer3 the xtss set point depends on the temperature table 1 the xtss concentration is increased from 3 000 to 4 000 g tss m 3 during winter conditions i e t 15 c to establish a longer sludge retention time srt and to maintain the nitrification capacity solon et al 2017 vanrolleghem et al 2010 table 2 shows that there is a reduction in n2o emissions due to the increase of the do setpoint which decreases the nitrite concentration compared to a0 and leads to a reduction of n2o emissions through the nd pathway fig 2 a shows that there are two different trends in n2o emission rates depending on the season on the one hand the aeration demand is low during summer day 254 to 357 and day 549 to 609 the do ranges between 1 and 2 g o2 m 3 and nitrite is accumulating in the reactors fig 2g this causes n2o emissions via the nd pathway of aobs to increase fig 2d on the other hand during winter conditions aeration increases and nitrite levels decrease which deactivates the nd pathway however the production of n2o by the nn and den pathways increases because the cascade nh4 control has difficulty in maintaining the desired nh4 concentration during winter see figs 2d and 2g considering the applied constraints in the do set point to avoid unrealistic control applications minimum of 0 g o2 m 3 and maximum of 6 g o2 m 3 the ghg emissions from the biotreatment co2 biogenic plus n2o from n removal and the total ghg emissions decreased 4 0 and 3 6 respectively due to the decrease in n2o emissions the variation of the waste flow rates during summer and winter led to an improvement in the ad performance since more methane was produced eproduction increased which however led to an increase in ad emissions due to increased combustion of biogas eqi improved in a1 due to lower effluent n concentrations tkn decreased from 5 8 to 3 6 g n m 3 a0 vs a1 and the tiv of ammonium decreased from 35 3 to 0 2 the average p concentration remained the same and the total p concentration in the effluent decreased by only 0 1 g p m 3 compared to a0 the oci increased compared to a0 mainly due to increased aeration costs during the winter period i e when the temperature is below 15 c between days 357 and 549 of the simulation since a higher do set point is required to maintain the desired ammonium concentration fig 2g 3 2 2 control strategy a2 fe chemical precipitation of po4 3 control strategy a2 aims at reducing the effluent p concentration via its chemical precipitation with fe by adsorption and co precipitation of phosphate species onto hfos a2 includes a1 and a pi controller that regulates the fecl3 addition in aer3 reactor to maintain the p concentration in aer3 reactor at the desired set point of 1 g p m 3 table 1 the average spo4 concentration in scenario a0 already was 1 g p m 3 but high p peaks were observed in the effluent the objective of a2 is mitigating these p peaks avoiding the high tiv 40 5 observed regarding ghg emissions total emissions in a2 increased slightly due to i more biogenic co2 was emitted pao activity decreased because there was less phosphate in the anaerobic reactor resulting in a higher fraction of cod removed by heterotrophic biomass this biomass produces more inorganic carbon than pao when removing cod ii higher production of biogas and therefore higher emissions from the ad the iron species enhance primary clarification and more cod is redirected to the ad system and iii indirect co2 emitted by the use of fecl3 the observed n2o emissions were the same as in control strategy a1 because the n fluxes were not affected by the addition of iron see table 2 a2 led to a lower concentration of p in the effluent and consequently the tiv of total p decreased from 40 5 with a0 to 20 0 with a2 and the eqi was reduced by about 23 table 2 the phosphate controller was able to reduce the spo4 peaks in the aer3 reactor with the addition of fe compared to control strategy a0 table 2 however the controller was not able to maintain the spo4 at the desired set point the average fecl3 flow rate throughout the evaluation period was 88 kg fe d which led to a considerable increase of the operational cost mainly due to the iron dosage 2400 ton fe 1 solon et al 2017 3 2 3 control strategy a3 struvite recovery control strategy a3 complements a1 by including p and n recovery as struvite in the digester supernatant the layout of the wrrf was modified by including a recovery unit rec based on struvite precipitation see figure s3 in supplementary information section the rec unit includes a crystallizer to support struvite precipitation a storage tank for magnesium hydroxide mg oh 2 and a dewatering unit kazadi mbamba et al 2016 solon et al 2017 a pi controller was added to control the effluent p from the recovery unit at a set point of 50 g p m 3 by manipulating the mg oh 2 flow rate qmg oh 2 ghg emissions from the whole wrrf decreased table 2 n2o emissions decreased slightly because the influent n load to the as unit decreased due to struvite crystallization in the reject water stream and thus p and n recovery as struvite also had a potential benefit on ghg emissions due to more diluted streams the struvite recovered was 442 kg d 1 which resulted in 99 8 kg p d 1 48 5 of the total p influent load and 45 0 kg n d 1 recovered 4 2 of the total n influent load respectively the reject water p load was reduced from 232 3 kg p d 1 a1 to 11 2 kg p d 1 a3 which resulted in a 95 reduction in the influent p load to the biological reactors table 2 shows that the average effluent p concentrations in a3 were lower than those in strategies a0 to a2 the wrrf was able to discharge p below the legal limits most of the time tiv of 0 3 and eqi decreased by a significant 31 with respect to a1 table 2 also shows that oci decreased 18 compared to a1 i e struvite recovery is techno economically feasible considering only the operational costs associated with the addition of mg and struvite revenues in a current market scenario more struvite could be recovered by lowering the phosphate set point of the controller since there was still a surplus of 11 2 kg d 1 of inorganic p available to be precipitated as struvite fig 3 a however this would imply a higher cost of mg oh 2 and with the selected setpoint it was enough to meet p discharge limits struvite can be precipitated in a wide range of ph between 7 and 11 with an optimum ph range between 8 0 and 9 5 the addition of mg oh 2 was enough to increase ph from 7 1 to 8 3 fig 3b favouring struvite precipitation without requiring an additional aeration unit for co2 stripping nor the addition of more alkalinity such as naoh kazadi mbamba et al 2016 solon et al 2017 further studies are required to assess the capital costs associated with struvite recovery and additional transport costs these costs were not considered in the evaluation criteria 3 2 4 control strategy a4 ammonium nitrite cascade controllers and struvite recovery control strategy a4 aims at reducing ghg emissions with a particular emphasis on n2o emissions derived from biological n removal a4 extends a3 with a cascade pi nitrite controller in aer2 reactor nitrite concentration was maintained at the desired set point by manipulating the set point of the do controller in conjunction with the ammonium cascade pi controller both controllers calculated an adequate do set point and the maximum value was chosen see table 1 for the characteristics of the controllers the set point signal of both controllers was smoothened using a first order exponential filter with a time constant of 15 min to avoid numerical instabilities during solver integration a4 led to the minimum ghg emissions with respect to the previously implemented strategies a0 to a3 the n2o emissions were reduced by 7 5 compared to a3 the implementation of the nitrite pi cascade controller reduced the n2o emissions during the summer conditions compared to a1 figs 2a and 2b since one of the substrates of the nd pathway i e nitrite was minimized figs 2d and 2e the n2o emissions during winter conditions remained the same as in a1 because the ammonium pi cascade was preferentially fixing the do set point the nitrification capacity should be increased in order to further reduce the n2o emissions during winter by for example increasing the do levels or the mlss concentration with the trade off of further increasing the operational costs a4 slightly increased the effluent n concentration in comparison to a3 2 8 increase in total n compared to a3 due to more ammonium being nitrified in a4 compared to a3 effluent tkn decreased by 5 and the increase of effluent nitrate concentration in this sense the implementation of ammonium and nitrite cascade controllers also slightly increased oci by 1 8 compared to a3 since the applied do set point was always the maximum of the ammonium and nitrite controllers and the aeration costs incremented by 2 3 compared to a3 the same amount of struvite was obtained as in a3 because the fluxes of p in the sludge line remained unaffected fig 2h shows that during summer conditions i e t above 15 c the do set point is mostly defined by the nitrite controller nh4 is below the set point of 2 g n m 3 and no2 concentration is around the set point of 0 5 g n m 3 the nh4 controller is only activated during the daily peaks when the influent n load is high in summer the do set point is defined by the nh4 controller only 23 of the time on the other hand during winter conditions the do set point is defined most of the time 62 by the nh4 controller to ensure complete nitrification 3 2 5 control strategy a5 ammonium nitrous oxide cascade controllers and struvite recovery a5 is a modification of a4 that also aimed at reducing n2o emissions new sensors have appeared in the market that enable the monitoring of soluble n2o concentration in the reactors with high accuracy and thus allow designing novel mitigation strategies for this reason a5 included a cascade pi controller based on the measurement and control of n2o concentration in aer2 in a similar way to a4 n2o and nh4 controllers calculated so2 set points for the do controller and the chosen value was the maximum table 1 the ghg emissions obtained were the lowest amongst all the control strategies implemented table 2 with 13 reduction in n2o emissions compared to a1 and 1 reduction compared to a4 fig 4 shows the concentration of soluble n2o in aer2 predicted in a4 and a5 n2o concentration in a5 was much more constant due to the n2o pi cascade controller which actively imposed the do set point when the n2o concentration in aer2 was too high only in the transition period from summer to winter t around 15 c the cascade pi controllers of a4 achieved lower n2o concentrations and lower n2o emissions than in a5 this was due to the n2o pi of a5 being deactivated and the do setpoint was being fixed by the nh4 controller on the other hand during summer and winter i e t above 16 c and t below 14 c the cascade controllers of a5 achieved lower n2o soluble concentration in aer2 fig 4 and lower global n2o emissions fig 2b and c these results also point to a simpler alternative strategy that could lead to reduction in n2o and ghg emissions reducing the nh4 set point in strategy a1 or implementing a properly selected temperature dependent nh4 set point similar to the tss controller would probably provide some further improvements although the automated set point selection of the closed loop control would be lost in this case the effluent concentrations and the tiv obtained for a5 were the same as for a4 therefore a high effluent quality was obtained however the oci was 1 3 higher than a4 since slightly more oxygen was required to maintain the n2o set point the do set point was set by the n2o cascade pi in a5 58 of the time whereas the do set point was fixed by the nitrite controller in a4 56 of the time 3 2 6 comparison of the evaluation criteria for the control strategies implemented fig 5 compares eqi oci biogenic n2o emissions and total ghg emissions for each control strategy implemented the data are normalised considering 100 for the values obtained with the reference operation a0 all control strategies led to a more sustainable overall plant performance since all of them obtained a better effluent quality i e lower eqi and lower ghg emissions compared to the default scenario regarding operational costs the ammonium cascade controller a1 increased the oci by 4 compared to a0 due to the more intense aeration demands the chemical p precipitation strategy a2 increased the oci by 36 compared to a0 due to the high cost of fecl3 dosage on the other hand struvite precipitation in the reject water control strategy a3 was the most successful strategy in terms of eqi and oci leading to a reduction in eqi of 40 compared to a0 and 31 compared to a1 and a reduction in oci of 11 and 14 compared to a0 and a1 respectively these improvements were due to 1 the potential benefits of struvite sales and 2 the reduction in influent load of p and n which led to lower aeration demand control strategies a4 and a5 obtained higher reduction in n2o emission from n removal compared to a0 control strategies a4 and a5 merged the ammonium cascade controller of a1 with another nitrite or soluble n2o cascade controller and the struvite precipitation of a3 both control strategies led to higher operational costs than a3 1 8 and 2 8 respectively due to the increased aeration demand imposed by the cascade controllers a5 seems to have a better performance since it led to a reduction of the emitted n2o in the biotreatment of 27 but at the expense of higher costs i e 1 3 higher in a5 compared to a4 there is therefore a compromise between operational costs and ghg emissions since operational costs increased slightly in both strategies compared to a3 where the main difference between the objectives of a3 compared to a4 and a5 was the reduction of ghg emissions and moreover a4 and a5 achieved the same eqi finally fig 5 shows that the largest reduction in total ghg emissions was 9 compared to a0 despite the fact that the main aim of the novel control strategies is n2o reduction other sources of ghg emissions were not reduced such as indirect emissions electricity chemical usage sludge storage and reuse which represented about 20 of the total ghg emissions and other direct ghg sources that were not controllable such as biogenic co2 and methane combustion which together represented around 50 of the total ghg emissions see table s1 of supplementary information section 4 comparison with other works and limitations of the proposed methodology the proposed bsm2 psfe ghg plant wide model and the implemented control strategies results represent an improvement to the current bsm modelling framework bsm2 psfe solon et al 2017 by adding the ghg production and emission during nutrient removal and recovery operational control strategies in this sense the bsm2 psfe ghg provides a new tool that shows in a plant wide context the trade offs that different novel control strategies had on the sustainability of the wrrf on the other hand the bsm2 psfe ghg updates previous works addressed to characterize ghg emissions with a particular emphasis on n2o emissions which were designed for different plant wide models flores alsina et al 2014 2011 sweetapple et al 2014 by i adding the ghg emissions to the most recent bsm modelling framework capable of simulating nutrient recovery strategies solon et al 2017 ii adding all the known biological n2o pathways reported in the asm2d n2o model massara et al 2018 iii improving the calculation of co2 emissions by including the general aqueous phase model flores alsina et al 2015 solon et al 2017 and iv updating the sources of direct and indirect ghg emissions flores alsina et al 2011 arnell 2016 the results reported for each control strategy were unified into three main groups eqi oci and ghg as proposed by flores alsina et al 2014 this enabled a fairer evaluation of the different strategies since none of the criteria depended on the others other works have proposed to unify the multicriteria into a single cost function by transforming effluent quality into monetary units by defining tariffs or taxes when the concentrations in the effluent are above a certain limit guerrero et al 2012 stare et al 2007 or applying a defined weighted average of the different evaluation criteria machado et al 2020 the benefits of the latter approach are that control strategies are compared with a single index in this work a unified cost function could be defined if ghg emissions were also translated into monetary units by imposing tariffs due to high emissions special attention should be paid to defining the different weights of the cost function since an optimisation of the cost function could lead to high ghg emissions or to poor effluent quality with low operational costs p recovery as struvite strategies a3 onwards showed an improvement in the operational costs due to the potential revenues from struvite however these results should be taken with caution as the assumed price of struvite 200 ton 1 as in solon et al 2017 is very uncertain in addition struvite recovery improved effluent quality due to reduced p and n loading in the sludge line recycles and that also decreases operational costs in fact the oci would also improve by 17 6 compared to a1 assuming no benefit from struvite sales finally p recovery as struvite also showed a reduction in ghg emissions from the as unit mainly due to the decrease in the n influent load other important assumptions were made in the crystallizer unit model such as ideal solids separation and simplified precipitate dissolution solon et al 2017 in addition potential pipe clogging in the rec unit due to struvite precipitation was not considered and is known to be a major issue during p recovery as struvite these limitations in the crystallizer model should be addressed in future work to obtain a better estimation of struvite recovery one limitation of bsm2 psfe ghg is that capital expenditure was not included in the evaluation criteria and the comparison between control strategies was only subject to operational costs adding the capital costs of equipment sensors civil electrical and piping will provide a more complete assessment machado et al 2020 ostace et al 2013 solon et al 2017 for example integrating p recovery as struvite recovery implies a modification of the plant layout or adding a rec unit and all related equipment that would result in a higher capital investment when retrofitting or upgrading the wrrf on the other hand p precipitation by fe addition control strategy a2 showed higher operational costs than a3 but this strategy only implies adding an extra dosing tank to the existing plant layout the proposed control strategies showed the logical steps that a wrrf manager should take to improve effluent quality a1 to a3 and afterwards to reduce ghg emissions a4 and a5 however each of the control strategies could be optimized i the location of the fe addition in a2 can be optimised to reduce operational costs as already reported kazadi mbamba et al 2019 ii each of the set point values can be optimized as in guerrero et al 2011 in order to decrease the eqi and oci and to minimise ghg emissions for instance the reduction of the nh4 set point value from 2 0 to 1 0 g n m 3 in a1 table 1 led to a 45 reduction in n2o emissions while the oci increased by 4 and the eqi by 14 iii n2o emissions in the as unit could be reduced by adding do nh4 no2 or n2o sensors and controllers in each aerobic reactor to better control the wrrf as in santín et al 2017 who also aimed at reducing ghg emissions during wastewater treatment by using the bsm2g modelling framework flores alsina et al 2011 this strategy enabled a more robust do control and therefore a more robust control of n2o emissions however the addition of multiple controllers in each aerobic reactor results in a more complex control structure for the biological reactors and would increase the capital and maintenance costs of the associated sensors instruments and controllers 5 conclusions in this paper a novel plant wide model that integrates the latest advances in energy and nutrient recovery modelling for an accurate description of n2o and ebpr related processes is proposed five control strategies are evaluated in view of optimising plant performance minimizing ghg emissions and implementing nutrient recovery the main findings of the work are direct and indirect ghg emissions for co2 n2o and ch4 were quantified in the whole wrrf overall and individual mass balances quantify the distribution of c n and p in the whole wrrf all five control strategies led to an overall more efficient and sustainable plant performance p recovery as struvite led to decreased p and n concentrations in the biological reactors which reduced the n2o emissions in the biotreatment by 17 compared to the open loop configuration the lowest n2o and overall ghg emissions were achieved when ammonium and soluble nitrous oxide in the aerobic reactors were controlled achieving a reduction of 24 and 27 for n2o respectively and 9 for total ghg compared to the open loop configuration software

16154,in this study a plant wide model describing the fate of c n and p compounds upgraded to account for on site off site greenhouse gas ghg emissions was implemented within the international water association iwa benchmarking simulation model no 2 bsm2 framework the proposed approach includes the main biological n2o production pathways and mechanistically describes co2 biogenic non biogenic emissions in the activated sludge reactors as well as the biogas production co2 ch4 from the anaerobic digester indirect ghg emissions for power generation chemical usage effluent disposal and sludge storage and reuse are also included using static factors for co2 ch4 and n2o global and individual mass balances were quantified to investigate the fluxes of the different components novel strategies such as the combination of different cascade controllers in the biological reactors and struvite precipitation in the sludge line were proposed in order to obtain high plant performance as well as nutrient recovery and mitigation of the ghg emissions in a plant wide context the implemented control strategies led to an overall more sustainable and efficient plant performance in terms of better effluent quality reduced operational cost and lower ghg emissions the lowest n2o and overall ghg emissions were achieved when ammonium and soluble nitrous oxide in the aerobic reactors were controlled

years the scarcity of natural resources and the concern about climate change have shifted the water sector paradigm therefore wastewater treatment plants wwtps are becoming water resource recovery facilities wrrfs this fact has promoted both the chemical and environmental engineering community and the water industry to widen the scope of these utilities to better understand and to design these new facilities plant wide modelling tools have become essential jeppsson et al 2013 wastewater treatment modelling researchers have integrated the main unit operations of a wrrf primary clarifier biological reactor secondary settler thickeners anaerobic digester dewatering unit etc to account for all the interactions amongst processes barat et al 2013 gernaey et al 2014 grau et al 2007 hauduc et al 2019 solon et al 2017 vaneeckhaute et al 2018 in view of simulating wrrf under different scenarios and of designing novel control strategies for a better performance plant wide wrrf modelling comprises chemical and physico chemical models to assess the new challenges of the wastewater treatment particularly precipitation models of common chemical compounds in wastewater hauduc et al 2015 kazadi mbamba et al 2016 2015b aqueous phase chemistry models flores alsina et al 2015 solon et al 2015 and mass transfer models amaral et al 2019 lizarralde et al 2015 have been proposed and calibrated to study different subprocesses of a wwrf in addition to the traditional activated sludge models asm based on biological processes batstone et al 2002 henze et al 2015 recently solon and co workers solon et al 2017 proposed a novel plant wide model capable of predicting the fate of phosphorus p in both water and sludge lines as well as the interactions with sulphur s and iron fe thanks to the implementation of comprehensive physico chemical process models this work combined a modified activated sludge model no 2d asm2d model with a speciation model routine to predict ph at each time step flores alsina et al 2015 this model evaluated and compared several energy and nutrient recovery strategies but without accounting for ghg emissions indeed ghg emissions should be included when evaluating the overall sustainability of control operational strategies for water resource recovery to add another important criterion in the multivariable space of performance assessment otherwise a good a priori control structure providing excellent effluent quality and lower costs could obtain this at the expense of high ghg emissions that are not being considered previous modelling studies have already included ghg emissions as a potential performance criterion when evaluating the sustainability of wwtps amongst the ghgs n2o emissions which have a 300 fold stronger global warming effect than carbon dioxide co2 ipcc 2013 have recently received a lot of attention several extensions based on asm models have been proposed in the literature to better describe n2o emissions during biological nitrogen removal domingo félez et al 2017 mannina et al 2016 massara et al 2018 ni and yuan 2015 pocquet et al 2016 however although some parameters of the models are ph dependent the evolution of ph in the different reactors is not predicted since the effect on ph of the processes taking place are not considered specifically the growth rate of nitrifiers depends on ph and consequently the n2o emissions produced by nitrifiers cannot be described accurately for several operational conditions su et al 2019 in addition co2 emissions are typically not accounted for since the evolution of inorganic carbon ic is not modelled however nitrifiers growth depends on ic availability guisasola et al 2007 torà et al 2010 wett and rauch 2003 zhang et al 2018 and its limitation could be significant in some scenarios one of the most used plant wide model that takes into account the ghg emissions is the bsm2g flores alsina et al 2011 several works in the literature have applied this model to study the effect on ghg emissions when implementing different control operational strategies barbu et al 2017 flores alsina et al 2014 2011 santín et al 2018 2017 sweetapple et al 2015 however bsm2g cannot describe the transformations and fate of p in the plant and moreover not all the known n2o production pathways are included in this model indeed n2o could be produced during the denitrifying phosphorus removal process liu et al 2015 hence a new model extension is needed to enable the evaluation of all the potential ghg emission sources when integrating the potential resource recovery mechanisms in wrrfs the current limitations of the previous approaches create the need to define a new extended benchmarking scenario bsm2 psfe ghg including biological cod n p removal ghg emissions and chemical and physico chemical models to evaluate resource recovery in wrrfs the main objective of the present work is to develop and evaluate this bsm2 psfe ghg plant wide benchmarking scenario by integrating i the biological model asm2d n2o proposed by massara et al 2018 accounting for both enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr and the most recently reported n2o production pathways ii potential sources of ghg emissions through the wrrf updated from flores alsina et al 2011 iii plant wide modelling of detailed p chemical processes solon et al 2017 and iv development of novel control strategies based on nitrite and nitrous oxide sensors to mitigate n2o emissions once the development of the bsm2 psfe ghg sub models and their interfaces is detailed simulations will help to understand how novel nutrient recovery control strategies can affect ghg emissions in a plant wide context in this sense this work aims at i studying the effect on ghg emissions when implementing nutrient recovery control strategies and ii designing and implementing novel control operational strategies to optimise plant performance while reducing the ghg emissions 2 material and methods 2 1 bsm2 psfe ghg description 2 1 1 biological models the asm2d psfe n2o model defined in this work merges the bsm2 psfe approach of solon et al 2017 and the asm2d n2o model of massara et al 2018 that has been successfully applied to describe n2o emissions in full scale wwtps solís et al 2022 hence asm2d psfe n2o describes simultaneous biological c n and p removal as well as the chemical and biological processes related to s and fe and n2o production and emission therefore asm2d psfe n2o presents five new state variables compared to the bsm2 psfe model i e sno2 sno sn2o snh2oh and xnob the n2o biological pathways adapted from massara et al 2018 are 1 nh2oh oxidation pathway nn pathway n2o is produced from the reduction of no by the enzyme nor of aob coupled with the oxidation of nh2oh to no2 pocquet et al 2016 2 aob nitrifier denitrification pathway nd pathway n2o is produced from no2 reduction to no and subsequently to n2o by aob these two processes are lumped in one single reaction as in pocquet et al 2016 3 heterotrophic denitrification pathway den pathway n2o is produced as an intermediate of the denitrification processes either by oho or pao hiatt and grady 2008 the three biological n2o production pathways were included in the asm2d psfe n2o model to account for all the known biological n2o production pathways and to fairly assess the contribution of each pathway under dynamic conditions and under the different control operational strategies implemented the stoichiometric matrix and the continuity verification of the modified asm2d psfe n2o model were calculated as in hauduc et al 2010 and are provided in the supplementary information section the anaerobic digestion model adm implemented is an extension of the adm1 model batstone et al 2002 reproducing the biological and chemical interactions between p s and fe as reported in previous works flores alsina et al 2016 solon et al 2017 the kinetic parameters of both models can be obtained from the software implementation or from the original sub models flores alsina et al 2016 massara et al 2018 solon et al 2017 2 1 2 physico chemical models pcms bsm2 psfe ghg embraces three different pcms as proposed in the bsm2 psfe approach solon et al 2017 the ph and ion speciation pairing model aqueous phase chemistry model the multiple mineral precipitation mmp model and the gas liquid mass transfer model 2 1 2 1 ph and ion speciation pairing a general aqueous phase chemistry model is used in both asm and adm describing the ph variation and ion pairing at each time step flores alsina et al 2015 solon et al 2015 the aqueous phase chemistry model corrects for ionic strength via the davies approach for chemical activity solon et al 2017 the acid base parameters and the activity coefficients are temperature dependent and all calculations are performed under non ideal conditions the acid base equilibria are described as a set of implicit algebraic equations and solved at each integration step of the ordinary differential equation solver the species concentrations take part in the biological and physico chemical processes a more detailed description of the aqueous phase chemistry model can be found in flores alsina et al 2015 and solon et al 2015 the integration of the ph and ion speciation allows to account for weak acid base conditions within the n2o production processes since the growth rates of nitrifiers xaob and xnob are functions of their substrates i e free ammonia fa nh3 and free nitrous acid fna hno2 respectively 2 1 2 2 multiple mineral precipitation mmp the precipitation equations are integrated as temperature dependent reversible processes with the saturation index si as the chemical driving force stumm and morgan 1996 the si was calculated by comparing the multiplication of the chemical activities of the dissolved ions of each mineral with its solubility product for a given aqueous phase three conditions can occur kazadi mbamba et al 2015a i si 0 the aqueous phase is undersaturated and the mineral is dissolved ii si 0 the aqueous phase is at equilibrium or iii si 0 the aqueous phase is oversaturated and chemical precipitation may occur the precipitation rate depends on the kinetic rate coefficient the species concentration the mineral solid phase and the order of the reaction kazadi mbamba et al 2015a 2015b solon et al 2017 the mmp model includes the most likely minerals to precipitate during wastewater treatment calcite caco3 hydroxyapatite ca5 po4 3 oh amorphous calcium phosphate ca3 po4 2 struvite mgnh4po4 6h20 k struvite mgkpo4 6h20 newberyite mghpo4 3h20 magnesite mgco3 and iron sulphide fes the simplified approach of hauduc et al 2015 is implemented to describe the precipitation of hydrous ferric oxides hfos the phosphate adsorption and phosphate co precipitation to better estimate the phosphorus chemical precipitation 2 1 2 3 gas liquid transfer the gas liquid transfer processes are described for the gas components co2 o2 no n2o n2 and h2s the gas liquid transfer is based on fick s first law eq 1 which states that the transfer rate ρ i is proportional to the global mass transfer coefficient k l a i and the driving force is the difference between the saturation concentration and the concentration of the gas in the liquid phase the saturation concentration is calculated through henry s law which states that there is a proportionality kh i between the saturation concentration of the gas dissolved in the liquid and the partial pressure of the gas pi 1 ρ i k l a i k h i p i c i the mass transfer coefficient for each gas i co2 o2 no n2o n2 and h2s is calculated from eq 2 as the square root of the ratio of the diffusivities of the gaseous component in the liquid di to that of oxygen do2 and proportional to the mass transfer coefficient of the reference compound oxygen lizarralde et al 2015 2 k l a i k l a o 2 d i d o 2 1 2 the gas liquid transfer processes in adm are included for the following gas components h2o co2 h2 ch4 and h2s and are implemented as described by batstone et al 2002 2 2 model integration the different sub models asm2d psfe n2o adm and pcms in bsm2 psfe ghg were integrated using model interfaces the asm adm and adm asm interfaces are based on the continuity based interfacing method nopens et al 2009 to ensure elemental mass and charge conservation the interfaces consider instantaneous processes i e processas ad and state variable conversions i e convas ad the asm adm interface processas ad involves 1 the removal of cod demanding compounds nh2oh o2 no3 no2 no and n2o with the associated growth of biomass and 2 the decay of biomass oho pao aob and nob to produce proteins xpr lipids xli carbohydrates xch and inert particulate organics xi the convas ad involve 1 the conversion of soluble fermentable organics sf to amino acids saa sugars ssu and fatty acids sfa 2 the conversion of biodegradable particulate organics xs to xpr xli and xch and 3 the direct mapping of acetate sa to sac and inert soluble and particulate organics si and xi solon et al 2017 regarding the adm asm interface a comprehensive description of the involved processes and conversion can be found in flores alsina et al 2016 finally the pcms integration into asm and adm models was made following the procedures detailed in the original works flores alsina et al 2015 solon et al 2017 2015 2 3 plant layout and ancillary processes bsm2 psfe ghg was implemented in the same plant layout as the bsm2 psfe solon et al 2017 the wrrf consists of a primary clarifier prim an activated sludge section as a secondary clarifier sec a sludge thickener thk an anaerobic digester ad a dewatering unit dew and finally a storage tank st fig 1 additional models were considered to simulate the ancillary processes prim sec thk dew and st the prim 900 m3 was modelled according to otterpohl and freund 1992 with different settling velocities for biodegradable and non biodegradable compounds wentzel et al 2006 the as had an a2 o configuration consisting of 7 tanks in series tanks 1 and 2 were anaerobic anaer1 and anaer2 with a total volume of 2000 m3 tanks 3 and 4 were anoxic anox1 and anox2 with a total volume of 3000 m3 while tanks 5 6 and 7 were aerobic aer1 aer2 and aer3 with a total volume of 9000 m3 the sec surface of 1500 m2 and height of 4 m was modelled according to the double exponential settling velocity function of takács et al 1991 in a ten layer one dimensional settler the thk and dew units were modelled as ideal units with no biological activity and a constant percentage of tss in the concentrated sludge flows the ad had a working volume of 3400 m3 and a headspace volume of 300 m3 the st was modelled as a non reactive ideally mixed tank of 160 m3 additional information about the plant design and default operational conditions can be found in gernaey et al 2014 and solon et al 2017 the influent was generated following the principles proposed by gernaey et al 2011 finally the sensors and actuators were modelled with response time delay and white noise to avoid creating unrealistic control applications rieger et al 2003 2 4 estimation of ghg emissions different ghg compounds co2 ch4 and n2o type of emissions biogenic and non biogenic and sources of emissions direct or indirect were accounted for in bsm2 psfe ghg estimates not explicitly calculated by the sub models were estimated following the comprehensive methodology suggested by flores alsina et al 2014 2011 the different sources of ghg emissions considered throughout the wrrf are direct secondary treatment ghg emissions co2 generated from biomass respiration co2 generated from bod5 oxidation co2 credit from nitrification and n2o generated during biological n removal co2 emissions are explicitly accounted for by asm2d psfe n2o and pcms i e ph and ion speciation pairing and gas liquid transfer models by including ic instead of alkalinity as a state variable flores alsina et al 2015 n2o generated via the nn and nd pathways of aob and den pathway of heterotrophic organisms massara et al 2018 sludge processing ghg emissions ghg emissions during sludge processing are generated in the anaerobic digester co2 and ch4 emissions are explicitly calculated by the modified adm1 model flores alsina et al 2016 solon et al 2017 fugitive emissions from ad and co generation units are included as a total of 2 7 of the produced biogas that was slipped and un combusted magnus arnell 2016 the remaining biogas is combusted in the gas engine turbine and all the ch4 is converted to co2 generating electricity and heat the co2 produced in the ad and the co2 produced in the combustion are released into the atmosphere finally dissolved ch4 and h2 in the digester effluent is assumed to be fully stripped in the following process units and emitted to the atmosphere these emissions are accounted for in the ad important to maintain mass balances potential n2o emissions due to denitrification downstream of the ad unit oshita et al 2014 were not considered since the dew unit was modelled as a non reactive unit moreover it should be noted that neither no3 nor no2 were present in the ad net power related ghg emissions net power is the difference between energy consumption and production energy production is the electricity produced by the ad turbine and it is calculated using a factor for the energy content of ch4 50 014 mj kg ch4 1 and assuming an efficiency of 43 for electricity generation flores alsina et al 2011 energy consumption involves pumping mixing aeration and heating and is calculated using the operational cost index oci see section 2 5 a value of 0 359 kg co2 kwh 1 is selected for the co2 emission from net power production european production mix iea 2011 embedded ghg emissions from chemicals use the possible addition of chemicals in the wrrf produces embedded indirect ghg emissions the specific chemicals considered are i methanol dosage as external carbon source with a static factor of 1 54 kg co2 kg methanol 1 flores alsina et al 2011 ii fecl3 for p precipitation 0 16 kg co2 kg fecl3 1 iii naoh to raise the ph 1 24 kg co2 kg naoh 1 and iv mg oh 2 to favour the struvite precipitation 1 17 kg co2 kg mg oh 2 1 gustavsson and tumlin 2013 ghg emissions from effluent disposal n2o is produced in the receiving effluent due to the partial conversion of the remaining tn an emission factor of 5 g per kg tn discharged to recipient is obtained from the n2o emissions corresponding to disposal in lakes and rivers arnell 2016 sludge storage disposal and reuse direct emissions from sludge storage are estimated by assuming uncovered storage for 12 months as 8 68 kg ch4 per ton of vs and 1 1 of tn in sludge emitted as n2o arnell 2016 after the sludge storage it is transported for disposal and reuse causing indirect emissions of co2 ch4 and n2o the co2 emissions associated with the transport of biosolids are quantified by multiplying the truck movements by the distance of reuse co2 emissions from mineralization are calculated based on the sludge mass multiplied by the carbon concentration and the conversion factor from c to co2 n2o emissions are calculated based on a static factor of 0 01 kg n n2o per kg of tn in total three different sludge disposal alternatives are included agriculture 38 sludge disposal 150 km from the wrrf compost 45 sludge 20 km and forestry 17 sludge 144 km arnell 2016 bridle et al 2008 flores alsina et al 2011 finally all ghg emissions are converted into units of co2 equivalents co2e by the global warming potentials gwp the gwp for a 100 year time horizon for n2o and ch4 are 298 kg co2e per kg n2o and 34 kg co2e per kg ch4 respectively ipcc 2013 additional details on the implementation of ghg emissions can be found in section 6 2 5 evaluation criteria three performance indices were used to assess the plant performance for the different control operational strategies besides the classical evaluation criteria based on the effluent quality index eqi and the oci gernaey et al 2014 nopens et al 2010 total ghg emissions in co2e were added as an additional criterion as first proposed by flores alsina et al 2014 this value enables the understanding of the synergies and trade offs that different nutrient recovery control strategies can have on overall ghg emissions on the other hand eqi kg pollution units d 1 represents the overall pollution leaving the plant and is calculated with eq 3 as a weighted sum of effluent tss cod bod tkn nox oxidized forms of nitrogen including no3 no2 no n2o and nh2oh and organic and inorganic p porg and pinorg respectively solon et al 2017 3 eqi 1 t obs 1000 t start t stop β tss tss

gernaey et al 2014 and solon et al 2017 finally other legal criteria such as the percentage of time the plant is in violation tiv i e when effluent concentrations are above discharge limits for selected nutrients in the effluent were also used to evaluate the plant performance 2 6 control strategies table 1 summarises the individual controllers and control strategies combining different controllers that were applied in this work figures s1 s5 supplementary information section show the schematics of the control loops implemented in each control strategy the default scenario a0 is the open loop configuration gernaey et al 2014 thus the air flow rate supplied to the aerobic reactors value of the mass transfer coefficient kla and the purge flow rate were kept constant the performance of each implemented control strategy is evaluated by comparison with a0 by means of the evaluation criteria indices the control strategies a1 to a3 are based on the improvement of the water quality reduction of eqi and tiv for n and p species by optimizing the aeration strategy the sludge age in winter or by including nutrient recovery finally the control strategies a4 and a5 are mainly focused on reducing the ghg emissions while maintaining good effluent quality and low operating costs all dynamic simulations 609 days are preceded by a steady state simulation 300 days but only data generated during the last 364 days of dynamic simulations are used to evaluate the implemented control strategies the sensors characteristics applied in the implemented control strategies are summarized in section s2 3 results 3 1 steady state simulations fig 1 shows the total ghg emissions combined with the fractionation of ghg emissions on plant and off plant and the overall and individual mass balances for c n and p as well as the ph under steady state conditions for the a0 scenario amongst the total ghg emissions 65 consisted of co2 of which 63 of the total co2 emissions was biogenic co2 emitted in the biotreatment 29 of n2o 21 of the total n2o emitted was produced in the biotreatment section through n removal and 6 of ch4 the low ch4 emissions were due to all the produced ch4 in the ad was burnt in the gas engine unit and therefore transformed to co2 and energy most of the ghg emissions were direct emissions 80 i e produced in the wrrf the predicted indirect ghg emissions were mainly produced due to sludge disposal and reuse since the co2 emissions produced due to electricity production were mitigated from the electricity generated in the cogeneration unit of ch4 and no imbedded ghg emissions from chemicals use were produced regarding the fate of c the inlet c ends up in three different forms i 51 3 is emitted as co2 32 8 in the as section as biogenic co2 due to the organic matter oxidation and biomass respiration and 18 5 as combustion and leakages of biogas in the ad this represents 38 7 of the inlet c to the digester ii 23 1 is dissolved in the effluent mainly in the form of sic 80 and si 13 4 and iii 25 5 is disposed of in the sludge as particulate organics and biomass in the case of n the inlet n ends up in three different phases i 49 is discharged in the effluent mainly as sno3 31 4 and dissolved sn2 56 5 ii 21 4 ends up in the gas phase of the biological reactors mainly as n2 but with 1 0 of the inlet n as nn2o which is within the ranges reported by massara et al 2017 and ahn et al 2010 who obtained values of 0 3 3 of n2o emission in 12 different wwtps and iii the remaining 29 6 of the inlet n is disposed in the sludge mainly as biomass and entrapped in particulate organics one important outcome of this a0 operation is its feasibility to accomplish n removal despite its lack of active control since the values of tkn 2 8 g n m 3 and tn 11 0 g n m 3 in the effluent for a0 are below the bsm discharge limits tknlimit 4 g n m 3 tnlimit 18 g n m 3 the analysis of this scenario also shows the important effects of some recycled streams such as the overflows of the thickener and the dewatering unit which increase the n influent load to the plant by 21 5 regarding the p results only 22 3 of the influent p leaves the plant through the water line mainly as soluble orthophosphate spo4 43 6 and xpp 39 7 that overflows in the secondary settler the obtained effluent tp concentration is 2 37 g p m 3 above the bsm discharge limit of tplimit 2 0 g p m 3 the remaining 77 7 of inlet p remain in the waste sludge pointing out the possibility of recovering p from the anaerobic digestate moreover the recycles of the thickener overflows and the reject water 7 7 and 229 9 kg p d 1 respectively increase the influent p load by 95 3 2 dynamic simulations the dynamic simulation results of the default a0 scenario and the runs with implemented control strategies a1 a5 are summarized in table 2 in the case of a0 22 5 of the total ghg emissions come from n2o during biological n removal which represents a n2o emission factor n2o ef of 2 10 this emission factor could be reduced by analysing which biological pathways are producing most of the n2o and then designing adequate mitigation strategies table 2 also shows that the effluent obtained is acceptable in terms of effluent average concentrations during the evaluated period however the percentages of tiv for ammonium and p are high 35 3 and 40 5 respectively and thus there is a niche for a performance improvement using control strategies in the following sections the results for each implemented control strategy table 1 are presented and discussed the ghg emissions and the overall and individual mass balances q c n and p and ph for the main streams of the wrrf for each control strategy are reported in sections s3 and s4 supplementary information section 3 2 1 control strategy a1 ammonium cascade waste controller the a1 control strategy involves three controllers the first two control loops include two controllers following a cascade configuration currently known as aeration based ammonium controller abac in this configuration the do controller of the secondary feedback control loop is in charge of maintaining the do concentration in aer2 by manipulating the aeration flow kla value while the primary feedback control loop manipulates the do set point in aer2 using the ammonium concentration in aer2 as the controlled variable the ammonium set point in aer2 reactor is fixed at 2 g n m 3 an additional control loop acts on the purge flow qw to maintain the desired xtss concentration in aer3 the xtss set point depends on the temperature table 1 the xtss concentration is increased from 3 000 to 4 000 g tss m 3 during winter conditions i e t 15 c to establish a longer sludge retention time srt and to maintain the nitrification capacity solon et al 2017 vanrolleghem et al 2010 table 2 shows that there is a reduction in n2o emissions due to the increase of the do setpoint which decreases the nitrite concentration compared to a0 and leads to a reduction of n2o emissions through the nd pathway fig 2 a shows that there are two different trends in n2o emission rates depending on the season on the one hand the aeration demand is low during summer day 254 to 357 and day 549 to 609 the do ranges between 1 and 2 g o2 m 3 and nitrite is accumulating in the reactors fig 2g this causes n2o emissions via the nd pathway of aobs to increase fig 2d on the other hand during winter conditions aeration increases and nitrite levels decrease which deactivates the nd pathway however the production of n2o by the nn and den pathways increases because the cascade nh4 control has difficulty in maintaining the desired nh4 concentration during winter see figs 2d and 2g considering the applied constraints in the do set point to avoid unrealistic control applications minimum of 0 g o2 m 3 and maximum of 6 g o2 m 3 the ghg emissions from the biotreatment co2 biogenic plus n2o from n removal and the total ghg emissions decreased 4 0 and 3 6 respectively due to the decrease in n2o emissions the variation of the waste flow rates during summer and winter led to an improvement in the ad performance since more methane was produced eproduction increased which however led to an increase in ad emissions due to increased combustion of biogas eqi improved in a1 due to lower effluent n concentrations tkn decreased from 5 8 to 3 6 g n m 3 a0 vs a1 and the tiv of ammonium decreased from 35 3 to 0 2 the average p concentration remained the same and the total p concentration in the effluent decreased by only 0 1 g p m 3 compared to a0 the oci increased compared to a0 mainly due to increased aeration costs during the winter period i e when the temperature is below 15 c between days 357 and 549 of the simulation since a higher do set point is required to maintain the desired ammonium concentration fig 2g 3 2 2 control strategy a2 fe chemical precipitation of po4 3 control strategy a2 aims at reducing the effluent p concentration via its chemical precipitation with fe by adsorption and co precipitation of phosphate species onto hfos a2 includes a1 and a pi controller that regulates the fecl3 addition in aer3 reactor to maintain the p concentration in aer3 reactor at the desired set point of 1 g p m 3 table 1 the average spo4 concentration in scenario a0 already was 1 g p m 3 but high p peaks were observed in the effluent the objective of a2 is mitigating these p peaks avoiding the high tiv 40 5 observed regarding ghg emissions total emissions in a2 increased slightly due to i more biogenic co2 was emitted pao activity decreased because there was less phosphate in the anaerobic reactor resulting in a higher fraction of cod removed by heterotrophic biomass this biomass produces more inorganic carbon than pao when removing cod ii higher production of biogas and therefore higher emissions from the ad the iron species enhance primary clarification and more cod is redirected to the ad system and iii indirect co2 emitted by the use of fecl3 the observed n2o emissions were the same as in control strategy a1 because the n fluxes were not affected by the addition of iron see table 2 a2 led to a lower concentration of p in the effluent and consequently the tiv of total p decreased from 40 5 with a0 to 20 0 with a2 and the eqi was reduced by about 23 table 2 the phosphate controller was able to reduce the spo4 peaks in the aer3 reactor with the addition of fe compared to control strategy a0 table 2 however the controller was not able to maintain the spo4 at the desired set point the average fecl3 flow rate throughout the evaluation period was 88 kg fe d which led to a considerable increase of the operational cost mainly due to the iron dosage 2400 ton fe 1 solon et al 2017 3 2 3 control strategy a3 struvite recovery control strategy a3 complements a1 by including p and n recovery as struvite in the digester supernatant the layout of the wrrf was modified by including a recovery unit rec based on struvite precipitation see figure s3 in supplementary information section the rec unit includes a crystallizer to support struvite precipitation a storage tank for magnesium hydroxide mg oh 2 and a dewatering unit kazadi mbamba et al 2016 solon et al 2017 a pi controller was added to control the effluent p from the recovery unit at a set point of 50 g p m 3 by manipulating the mg oh 2 flow rate qmg oh 2 ghg emissions from the whole wrrf decreased table 2 n2o emissions decreased slightly because the influent n load to the as unit decreased due to struvite crystallization in the reject water stream and thus p and n recovery as struvite also had a potential benefit on ghg emissions due to more diluted streams the struvite recovered was 442 kg d 1 which resulted in 99 8 kg p d 1 48 5 of the total p influent load and 45 0 kg n d 1 recovered 4 2 of the total n influent load respectively the reject water p load was reduced from 232 3 kg p d 1 a1 to 11 2 kg p d 1 a3 which resulted in a 95 reduction in the influent p load to the biological reactors table 2 shows that the average effluent p concentrations in a3 were lower than those in strategies a0 to a2 the wrrf was able to discharge p below the legal limits most of the time tiv of 0 3 and eqi decreased by a significant 31 with respect to a1 table 2 also shows that oci decreased 18 compared to a1 i e struvite recovery is techno economically feasible considering only the operational costs associated with the addition of mg and struvite revenues in a current market scenario more struvite could be recovered by lowering the phosphate set point of the controller since there was still a surplus of 11 2 kg d 1 of inorganic p available to be precipitated as struvite fig 3 a however this would imply a higher cost of mg oh 2 and with the selected setpoint it was enough to meet p discharge limits struvite can be precipitated in a wide range of ph between 7 and 11 with an optimum ph range between 8 0 and 9 5 the addition of mg oh 2 was enough to increase ph from 7 1 to 8 3 fig 3b favouring struvite precipitation without requiring an additional aeration unit for co2 stripping nor the addition of more alkalinity such as naoh kazadi mbamba et al 2016 solon et al 2017 further studies are required to assess the capital costs associated with struvite recovery and additional transport costs these costs were not considered in the evaluation criteria 3 2 4 control strategy a4 ammonium nitrite cascade controllers and struvite recovery control strategy a4 aims at reducing ghg emissions with a particular emphasis on n2o emissions derived from biological n removal a4 extends a3 with a cascade pi nitrite controller in aer2 reactor nitrite concentration was maintained at the desired set point by manipulating the set point of the do controller in conjunction with the ammonium cascade pi controller both controllers calculated an adequate do set point and the maximum value was chosen see table 1 for the characteristics of the controllers the set point signal of both controllers was smoothened using a first order exponential filter with a time constant of 15 min to avoid numerical instabilities during solver integration a4 led to the minimum ghg emissions with respect to the previously implemented strategies a0 to a3 the n2o emissions were reduced by 7 5 compared to a3 the implementation of the nitrite pi cascade controller reduced the n2o emissions during the summer conditions compared to a1 figs 2a and 2b since one of the substrates of the nd pathway i e nitrite was minimized figs 2d and 2e the n2o emissions during winter conditions remained the same as in a1 because the ammonium pi cascade was preferentially fixing the do set point the nitrification capacity should be increased in order to further reduce the n2o emissions during winter by for example increasing the do levels or the mlss concentration with the trade off of further increasing the operational costs a4 slightly increased the effluent n concentration in comparison to a3 2 8 increase in total n compared to a3 due to more ammonium being nitrified in a4 compared to a3 effluent tkn decreased by 5 and the increase of effluent nitrate concentration in this sense the implementation of ammonium and nitrite cascade controllers also slightly increased oci by 1 8 compared to a3 since the applied do set point was always the maximum of the ammonium and nitrite controllers and the aeration costs incremented by 2 3 compared to a3 the same amount of struvite was obtained as in a3 because the fluxes of p in the sludge line remained unaffected fig 2h shows that during summer conditions i e t above 15 c the do set point is mostly defined by the nitrite controller nh4 is below the set point of 2 g n m 3 and no2 concentration is around the set point of 0 5 g n m 3 the nh4 controller is only activated during the daily peaks when the influent n load is high in summer the do set point is defined by the nh4 controller only 23 of the time on the other hand during winter conditions the do set point is defined most of the time 62 by the nh4 controller to ensure complete nitrification 3 2 5 control strategy a5 ammonium nitrous oxide cascade controllers and struvite recovery a5 is a modification of a4 that also aimed at reducing n2o emissions new sensors have appeared in the market that enable the monitoring of soluble n2o concentration in the reactors with high accuracy and thus allow designing novel mitigation strategies for this reason a5 included a cascade pi controller based on the measurement and control of n2o concentration in aer2 in a similar way to a4 n2o and nh4 controllers calculated so2 set points for the do controller and the chosen value was the maximum table 1 the ghg emissions obtained were the lowest amongst all the control strategies implemented table 2 with 13 reduction in n2o emissions compared to a1 and 1 reduction compared to a4 fig 4 shows the concentration of soluble n2o in aer2 predicted in a4 and a5 n2o concentration in a5 was much more constant due to the n2o pi cascade controller which actively imposed the do set point when the n2o concentration in aer2 was too high only in the transition period from summer to winter t around 15 c the cascade pi controllers of a4 achieved lower n2o concentrations and lower n2o emissions than in a5 this was due to the n2o pi of a5 being deactivated and the do setpoint was being fixed by the nh4 controller on the other hand during summer and winter i e t above 16 c and t below 14 c the cascade controllers of a5 achieved lower n2o soluble concentration in aer2 fig 4 and lower global n2o emissions fig 2b and c these results also point to a simpler alternative strategy that could lead to reduction in n2o and ghg emissions reducing the nh4 set point in strategy a1 or implementing a properly selected temperature dependent nh4 set point similar to the tss controller would probably provide some further improvements although the automated set point selection of the closed loop control would be lost in this case the effluent concentrations and the tiv obtained for a5 were the same as for a4 therefore a high effluent quality was obtained however the oci was 1 3 higher than a4 since slightly more oxygen was required to maintain the n2o set point the do set point was set by the n2o cascade pi in a5 58 of the time whereas the do set point was fixed by the nitrite controller in a4 56 of the time 3 2 6 comparison of the evaluation criteria for the control strategies implemented fig 5 compares eqi oci biogenic n2o emissions and total ghg emissions for each control strategy implemented the data are normalised considering 100 for the values obtained with the reference operation a0 all control strategies led to a more sustainable overall plant performance since all of them obtained a better effluent quality i e lower eqi and lower ghg emissions compared to the default scenario regarding operational costs the ammonium cascade controller a1 increased the oci by 4 compared to a0 due to the more intense aeration demands the chemical p precipitation strategy a2 increased the oci by 36 compared to a0 due to the high cost of fecl3 dosage on the other hand struvite precipitation in the reject water control strategy a3 was the most successful strategy in terms of eqi and oci leading to a reduction in eqi of 40 compared to a0 and 31 compared to a1 and a reduction in oci of 11 and 14 compared to a0 and a1 respectively these improvements were due to 1 the potential benefits of struvite sales and 2 the reduction in influent load of p and n which led to lower aeration demand control strategies a4 and a5 obtained higher reduction in n2o emission from n removal compared to a0 control strategies a4 and a5 merged the ammonium cascade controller of a1 with another nitrite or soluble n2o cascade controller and the struvite precipitation of a3 both control strategies led to higher operational costs than a3 1 8 and 2 8 respectively due to the increased aeration demand imposed by the cascade controllers a5 seems to have a better performance since it led to a reduction of the emitted n2o in the biotreatment of 27 but at the expense of higher costs i e 1 3 higher in a5 compared to a4 there is therefore a compromise between operational costs and ghg emissions since operational costs increased slightly in both strategies compared to a3 where the main difference between the objectives of a3 compared to a4 and a5 was the reduction of ghg emissions and moreover a4 and a5 achieved the same eqi finally fig 5 shows that the largest reduction in total ghg emissions was 9 compared to a0 despite the fact that the main aim of the novel control strategies is n2o reduction other sources of ghg emissions were not reduced such as indirect emissions electricity chemical usage sludge storage and reuse which represented about 20 of the total ghg emissions and other direct ghg sources that were not controllable such as biogenic co2 and methane combustion which together represented around 50 of the total ghg emissions see table s1 of supplementary information section 4 comparison with other works and limitations of the proposed methodology the proposed bsm2 psfe ghg plant wide model and the implemented control strategies results represent an improvement to the current bsm modelling framework bsm2 psfe solon et al 2017 by adding the ghg production and emission during nutrient removal and recovery operational control strategies in this sense the bsm2 psfe ghg provides a new tool that shows in a plant wide context the trade offs that different novel control strategies had on the sustainability of the wrrf on the other hand the bsm2 psfe ghg updates previous works addressed to characterize ghg emissions with a particular emphasis on n2o emissions which were designed for different plant wide models flores alsina et al 2014 2011 sweetapple et al 2014 by i adding the ghg emissions to the most recent bsm modelling framework capable of simulating nutrient recovery strategies solon et al 2017 ii adding all the known biological n2o pathways reported in the asm2d n2o model massara et al 2018 iii improving the calculation of co2 emissions by including the general aqueous phase model flores alsina et al 2015 solon et al 2017 and iv updating the sources of direct and indirect ghg emissions flores alsina et al 2011 arnell 2016 the results reported for each control strategy were unified into three main groups eqi oci and ghg as proposed by flores alsina et al 2014 this enabled a fairer evaluation of the different strategies since none of the criteria depended on the others other works have proposed to unify the multicriteria into a single cost function by transforming effluent quality into monetary units by defining tariffs or taxes when the concentrations in the effluent are above a certain limit guerrero et al 2012 stare et al 2007 or applying a defined weighted average of the different evaluation criteria machado et al 2020 the benefits of the latter approach are that control strategies are compared with a single index in this work a unified cost function could be defined if ghg emissions were also translated into monetary units by imposing tariffs due to high emissions special attention should be paid to defining the different weights of the cost function since an optimisation of the cost function could lead to high ghg emissions or to poor effluent quality with low operational costs p recovery as struvite strategies a3 onwards showed an improvement in the operational costs due to the potential revenues from struvite however these results should be taken with caution as the assumed price of struvite 200 ton 1 as in solon et al 2017 is very uncertain in addition struvite recovery improved effluent quality due to reduced p and n loading in the sludge line recycles and that also decreases operational costs in fact the oci would also improve by 17 6 compared to a1 assuming no benefit from struvite sales finally p recovery as struvite also showed a reduction in ghg emissions from the as unit mainly due to the decrease in the n influent load other important assumptions were made in the crystallizer unit model such as ideal solids separation and simplified precipitate dissolution solon et al 2017 in addition potential pipe clogging in the rec unit due to struvite precipitation was not considered and is known to be a major issue during p recovery as struvite these limitations in the crystallizer model should be addressed in future work to obtain a better estimation of struvite recovery one limitation of bsm2 psfe ghg is that capital expenditure was not included in the evaluation criteria and the comparison between control strategies was only subject to operational costs adding the capital costs of equipment sensors civil electrical and piping will provide a more complete assessment machado et al 2020 ostace et al 2013 solon et al 2017 for example integrating p recovery as struvite recovery implies a modification of the plant layout or adding a rec unit and all related equipment that would result in a higher capital investment when retrofitting or upgrading the wrrf on the other hand p precipitation by fe addition control strategy a2 showed higher operational costs than a3 but this strategy only implies adding an extra dosing tank to the existing plant layout the proposed control strategies showed the logical steps that a wrrf manager should take to improve effluent quality a1 to a3 and afterwards to reduce ghg emissions a4 and a5 however each of the control strategies could be optimized i the location of the fe addition in a2 can be optimised to reduce operational costs as already reported kazadi mbamba et al 2019 ii each of the set point values can be optimized as in guerrero et al 2011 in order to decrease the eqi and oci and to minimise ghg emissions for instance the reduction of the nh4 set point value from 2 0 to 1 0 g n m 3 in a1 table 1 led to a 45 reduction in n2o emissions while the oci increased by 4 and the eqi by 14 iii n2o emissions in the as unit could be reduced by adding do nh4 no2 or n2o sensors and controllers in each aerobic reactor to better control the wrrf as in santín et al 2017 who also aimed at reducing ghg emissions during wastewater treatment by using the bsm2g modelling framework flores alsina et al 2011 this strategy enabled a more robust do control and therefore a more robust control of n2o emissions however the addition of multiple controllers in each aerobic reactor results in a more complex control structure for the biological reactors and would increase the capital and maintenance costs of the associated sensors instruments and controllers 5 conclusions in this paper a novel plant wide model that integrates the latest advances in energy and nutrient recovery modelling for an accurate description of n2o and ebpr related processes is proposed five control strategies are evaluated in view of optimising plant performance minimizing ghg emissions and implementing nutrient recovery the main findings of the work are direct and indirect ghg emissions for co2 n2o and ch4 were quantified in the whole wrrf overall and individual mass balances quantify the distribution of c n and p in the whole wrrf all five control strategies led to an overall more efficient and sustainable plant performance p recovery as struvite led to decreased p and n concentrations in the biological reactors which reduced the n2o emissions in the biotreatment by 17 compared to the open loop configuration the lowest n2o and overall ghg emissions were achieved when ammonium and soluble nitrous oxide in the aerobic reactors were controlled achieving a reduction of 24 and 27 for n2o respectively and 9 for total ghg compared to the open loop configuration software
