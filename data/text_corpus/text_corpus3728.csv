18640,we have prepared core shell structured hollow fe pd c nanomaterials derived from fe metal organic frameworks which were synthesized via cheap fast and simple mechanochemical technique the obtained fe pd c can steadily and continuously release fe2 from the galvanic corrosion of fe0 anode to trigger h2o2 decomposition into hydroxyl radicals and cause fast 10 min and efficient mineralization rate 95 degradation of phenol the presence of low level of pd nps in fe pd c mass ratio of the raw material fe pd 100 1 facilitated fast fe3 fe2 redox cycle and thus improved the catalytic performance and ph endurance of the fe pd c after recycled four times fe pd c remained high catalytic performance and released low level of iron ions 2 5 mg l 1 which reduced the production of iron sludge after usage in contrast to zero valent iron zvi and commercial physically mixed fe c materials the core shell structure of fe pd c ensured efficient electron transferring from fe0 to carbon cathode and targets and prevented the precipitation of iron ions on fe0 surface avoiding the deactivation of fe0 and termination of fe c internal micro electrolysis ime and extending their service life the reactive species quenching experiments and esr characterization proved the synergistic effect of electrons and hydroxyl free radicals on degradation of phenol the carbon centered dmpo radical detected in reaction solution can be regarded as a proof for the strengthened oxidation ability of the combined ime and fenton reaction graphical abstract image 1 keywords mechanochemical technique fe c internal micro electrolysis fenton reaction phenol degradation 1 introduction zero valent iron activated carbon fe c internal micro electrolysis ime developed as a wastewater treatment technology during the 1970s has been widely used in the treatment of various industrial wastewaters including dyes pharmacy surfactants landfill leachate and toxic metals ju et al 2011 sirés et al 2012 wu et al 2013 zhou et al 2013 zhu et al 2014 2018 zhang et al 2015 2016 wang et al 2016 yang et al 2017 when mixing with granular activated carbon in solution numerous microscopic galvanic cells are formed between the particles of iron anode and carbon cathode the electrons and fe2 are supplied from the galvanic corrosion of fe0 anode and the carbon cathode can accelerate the reduction by accepting electrons and transferring the electrons to proton oxygen or the pollutants organic pollutants can be reduced by electrons free hydrogen h or oxidized by in situ generated h2o2 or ho zhu et al 2014 however the degradation efficiency of organic contaminants by the fe c ime still leaves much to be desired due to the weak oxidation ability of this technology recently in order to improve the wastewater treatment efficiency much attention has been paid to the combination of fe c ime with fenton reaction to mineralize organic pollutants in wastewater the generation of fe2 will trigger subsequent fenton reaction zhang and his coworkers zhang et al 2012 found that the addition of hydrogen peroxide at the end of ime would improve cod removal efficiency therefore fe c particles can be a good alternative as iron source for fenton electro fenton reaction due to its inexpensive price high catalytic activity long life span and easy practical utilization zhang et al 2012 the traditional fe c material is composed of scrap and activated carbon and the ime is usually carried out under acid conditions ph 2 3 to obtain high removal efficiency zhou et al 2013 the increase in ph results in the precipitation of both ferrous ion and ferric ion which blocks the electron transfer between fe0 and activated carbon since the two components are just physically mixed this accounted for the deactivation of the cast iron surface and the termination of ime cheng et al 2017 to solve this problem fe0 particles should combine with the carbon materials to form nanocomposites the full and firm contact of fe0 and carbon may ensure efficient electron transferring from fe0 anode to carbon cathode and subsequent to organic pollutants there are two common strategies for the preparation of composites of carbon materials and metal nanoparticles nps one is to decorate pre obtained carbon materials such as activated carbon carbon nanotubes with metal salts or oxides and then reduce them by chemical methods ju et al 2011 tong et al 2014 the other is the direct pyrolysis of the as prepared mixture under an inert atmosphere where high temperature can induce the carbonization of organic polymers and metal salts or oxides will be converted into metal nps by synchronous carbon thermic reduction ghimbeu et al 2015 yao et al 2016 zeng et al 2017 2018 the latter method is simpler and more useful for industrial scale application as it requires no additional carbon source and involves only a single calcination step qiang et al 2015 metal organic frameworks mofs built out of metal ions and organic ligands represent a class of scalable hybrid porous materials mofs can be converted to porous metal nps carbon heterostructures via simple hydrolysis or pyrolysis recent studies show that fe0 carbon composites derived from fe mofs display a core shell structure and the core shell fe0 c or fe3c c nps embed in the microporous carbon matrix li et al 2015 qiang et al 2015 an et al 2016 if this fe c composite is employed as fe c ime material it can be expected that the erosion of fe0 by oxygen during storage is decreased and precipitation of iron ions on fe0 surface is avoided due to the protection of carbon coat however to the best of our knowledge the mof derived fe c composites have not been used as fe c ime materials to degrade organic pollutants by far mofs are usually synthesized by solvothermal method which is at the laboratory scale and involved in hard reaction conditions mechanochemical method a simple environmental and low cost technology has been widely used in synthesis of advanced materials covered almost all aspects of material science wu et al 2012 during grinding the solids accept mechanical energy from balls and get rupture so the particle sizes of raw materials decrease and specific surface and surface energy increase the grinding process also causes the generation of defects in solids accelerates the migration of defects in the bulk increases the number of contacts between particles and renews the contacts avvakumov et al 2001 therefore the mechanical effects caused by collision can initiate significant structural changes and even chemical reactions in materials mechanochemical approach is a promising alternative for the large scale production of mofs through this technique high yields can be obtained in short reaction times working under mild conditions room temperature ambient pressure using small solvent amounts or even without solvent friščić et al 2010 klimakow et al 2010 pilloni et al 2015 santos et al 2015 užarević et al 2016 in the present study fe mof was synthesized via the simple and green mechanochemical approach and then carbonized in the n2 atmosphere to obtain core shell fe c nanocomposites with suitable fe c ratio trace amount of pd nps was introduced into the fe c composites by adding na2pdcl4 into the mof precursors before grinding the core shell structure and pd nps in fe pd c composites improved the

volume of tmaoh after grinding for 1 h fe mofs brown in color were obtained in a comparison study fe mofs were also synthesized via the traditional solvothermal method in dmf solvent at 100 c for 24 h sem images and xrd patterns showed that fe mofs prepared with the two methods possessed similar morphologies and bragg peaks fig s1 indicating the successful synthesis of fe mofs with the simple and fast mechanochemical method the as synthesized fe pd mofs were carbonized at 800 c in n2 atmosphere tem images show that one or two fe pd nps were enwrapped in the hollow carbon coat fig 1 a and b take fe pd 100 1 c as an example the particle size of fe pd nps core and fe pd c was ranged in 8 20 nm and 10 60 nm respectively the carbon coat was about 3 3 6 nm in thickness the hollow fe pd c particles were embedded within larger carbon shell which could greatly improve the stability of metal cores fig 1c in xrd patterns of fe c and fe pd c fig 1d well resolved peaks at 2θ 44 6 and 65 0 can be indexed to the 110 and 200 planes of α fe with a cubic body centered structure jcpds 06 0696 as a common impurity in fe c composites prepared with pyrolysis method considerable amount of fe3c with diffraction peaks at 35 6 37 6 42 8 43 6 45 9 49 1 50 9 and 78 3 qiang et al 2015 was also detected in these materials both α fe and fe3c phases have shown fenton like catalytic ability for organic pollutants removal wang et al 2015 xia et al 2017 the presence of fe3c also can promote the ime due to the potential difference between fe0 anode and fe3c cathode a small peak at 2θ 26 1 pdf no 00 035 0772 was assigned to the 002 plane of graphite this result indicated that the fe c and fe pd c were composed of graphitized carbon fe0 and fe3c in fe pd c the amount of pd nps was too low to observe the characteristic diffraction peaks of pd np in xrd pattern the surface compositions of fe mofs and fe pd mofs with different fe pd ratio and their carbonized samples were studied with xps analysis the o 1s xps lines showed that the o containing functional groups of the nanocomposites decreased greatly after carbonization figs s2a and s2b in the high resolution pd3d xps spectra of the fe pd mofs the pd 3d5 2 peaks centered at 338 4 ev which can be assigned to the pd2 state after carbonization the binding energy of the pd 3d5 2 peaks of all the fe pd c samples shifted to 336 2 ev proving the formation of pd nps fig 2 a and figs s2c and s2d in the fe 2p3 2 xps spectra of fe mofs and fe pd mofs the large and broad peak centered at 712ev represented the fe3 state of iron atoms after carbonization the main peak of fe 2p3 2 line on the surface of fe c moved to 711 6ev which indicated the presence of fe2 species formed due to the oxidation of fe0 surface upon exposure to laboratory air matsuyama et al 2012 for all the fe pd c samples a small peak of α fe at 707 5ev can be observed fig 2b and figs s2e and s2f suggesting that the presence of pd nps can enhance the stability of fe0 and prevent fe0 from oxidation by air in the raman spectra of fe c and fe pd c composites fig 2c a d band at 1339 cm 1 and a g band at 1580 cm 1 can be clearly seen attributing to the disordered amorphous carbon and in plane vibrations of crystalline graphite respectively the high intensity ratio of the d to g band was about 1 1 in the two materials suggesting that the carbon component in fe c and fe pd c composites possessed similar graphitization degree the contents of carbon and iron in nanocomposites were calculated from their tga curves the weight change of the two materials was associated with the oxidation of carbon and fe0 which led to weight loss and weight gain respectively the total weight loss was 18 5 and 20 8 wt for fe c and fe pd c during the oxidation process fig 2d thereby the weight content of fe0 in fe c and fe pd c composites was approximately 57 2 and 56 wt respectively assuming that all fe has transferred to fe2o3 and all c has been burnt out under air atmosphere in the vsm magnetization curves fig s3 of the two materials a hysteresis was observed and the coercivity was 81 07 and 88 30 oe respectively reflecting the ferromagnetic characteristic of these nanoparticles the saturation magnetization of fe c and fe pd c was 155 and 138 emu g respectively which guaranteed that these nanocomposites can be collected from aqueous solution under an external magnetic field after usage the pore structure and specific surface area of the samples were investigated by measuring the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms the brunauere emmette teller bet specific surface area of the obtained fe c and fe pd c composite was 123 2 and 113 5 m2 g 1 respectively in the pore size distribution plots obtained from the nitrogen adsorption data there was one peak located at 1 95 and 1 70 nm for fe c and fe pd c respectively suggesting that the two materials were composed of micropores 3 2 catalytic activity of fe pd c composites in fe c ime fenton reaction the catalytic activity of the fe pd c composites was evaluated based on the fenton degradation of phenol which is often used as model contaminants in wastewater treatment research due to their toxicity and frequent occurrence in environment the preliminary study showed that phenol was eliminated within 10 min as the ratio of fe pd in the catalyst was 100 1 100 2 100 4 and 100 5 when the ratio of fe pd was 100 0 5 total removal of phenol was achieved within 1 h therefore fe pd 100 1 c with low pd content and high catalytic efficiency was selected as the optimal catalyst the phzpc of fe pd c was about ph 5 75 fig s4a the pka of phenol is about 9 98 at ph 3 7 6 phenol exists in neutral undeprotonated form the highest adsorption of phenol on fe pd c obtained as both of them were in the neutral forms about ph 5 and 6 due to the hydrophobic interaction and π π stacking the elimination rate of phenol was about 10 25 in the designed ph range via adsorption fig s4b 3 2 1 effect of solution ph on phenol removal in fe c ime fenton reaction we examined the behavior of fe pd c catalysts in fenton reaction at initial ph 3 7 6 in the presence of h2o2 the degradation efficiency of 0 5 mm of phenol reached 100 at initial ph 3 and 4 within 10 min 99 and 95 within 1 h at initial ph 5 and 6 and 10 at initial ph 7 6 respectively fig 3 a the corresponding apparent rate constant assessed by the pseudo first order kinetics for phenol elimination was 1 433 1 426 0 202 and 0 060 min 1 at initial ph 3 4 5 and 6 respectively the obtained mineralization efficiency of phenols at initial ph 3 6 ranged in 63 6 92 8 fig 3b after reaction the initial solution ph increased to 4 3 6 5 7 5 8 4 and 8 8 respectively which was caused by the ime interaction of the fe pd c catalysts the utilization of h2o2 η in fenton reaction could be evaluated by the ratio of the stoichiometric h2o2 consumption h2o2 s for the pollutant mineralization with the actual h2o2 consumption h2o2 a the h2o2 utilization efficiencies by fe pd c catalysts were 64 9 64 3 62 3 and 44 5 at initial ph 3 4 5 and 6 respectively we measured the production of fe2 at various initial solution phs the concentration of fe2 in 1 h was 32 2 54 0 51 and 0 49 mg l 1 in reaction solution at initial ph 3 4 5 and 6 respectively fig 3c to assess the role of dissolved fe2 ions in solution on phenol degradation different concentration of feso4 0 01 0 1 0 2 0 4 and 0 5 mm was added in deionized water as homogeneous fenton catalyst at initial ph 3 5 to remove phenol with the initial concentration of fe2 0 2 mm phenol could be eliminated totally at initial ph 3 5 fig s5 when the initial concentration of fe2 was 0 1 5 6 mg l 1 and 0 01 mm 0 56 mg l 1 the degradation efficiency in 1 h was 100 81 21 and 10 3 0 at initial ph 3 4 and 5 respectively at initial ph 4 and 5 precipitation of fe oh 3 existed in all these reaction solutions leading to decreased equilibrium solution ph ph 3 5 even when the initial concentration of fe2 was as low as 0 01 mm according to these results we concluded that the dissolved fe2 also contributed to phenol degradation at low initial solution phs however phenol degradation mainly happened on fe pd c surface at ph 5 and 6 comparison study was conducted with fe c zvi and a commercial fe c material as catalysts for fenton degradation of phenols as shown in fig 3d f all the three catalytic systems showed similar oxidative degradation profile of phenol to the fe pd c h2o2 system at initial ph 3 at initial ph 4 elimination of phenol was fast and efficient catalyzed by zvi but retarded significantly and finished within 6 h with a 2 h of lag period catalyzed by fe c and completely stopped in the commercial fe c h2o2 system at initial ph 5 phenol was not degraded in these oxidation systems at initial ph 3 and 4 the fe2 was higher c fe 2 ph3 38 2 mg l 1 and c fe 2 ph4 9 42 mg l 1 leached from zvi and much lower dissolved from fe c c fe 2 ph3 1 36 mg l 1 and c fe 2 ph4 0 75 mg l 1 and the commercial fe c c fe 2 ph3 1 38 mg l 1 and c fe 2 ph4 0 23 mg l 1 compared to fe pd c fig 3c at initial ph 5 and 6 fe2 ions leached from zvi and the commercial fe c were undetectable but low level of fe2 about 0 1 mg l 1 dissolved from fe c was still measured which resulted from the efficient galvanic corrosion of fe0 anode we also made a comparison on the catalytic performance of fe pd c for phenol degradation with other materials reported in literature the results table 1 showed that the degradation and mineralization efficiency of phenol catalyzed by fe pd c in a wider ph range were higher than those obtained with iron oxides and fe clays based catalysts wang et al 2013 yang et al 2013 djeffal et al 2014 tian et al 2017 gao et al 2018 fe pd c exhibited similar catalytic performance and higher stability at low solution ph compared to dendritic fe0 xia et al 2017 3 2 2 effect of h2o2 catalyst dosage and phenol concentration on phenol removal initial h2o2 concentration and catalyst dosage affected significantly on phenols degradation with the fixed phenol concentration 0 5 mm at initial ph 4 phenol disappearance and mineralization level was 63 31 6 and 89 48 4 respectively with 3 and 5 mm of h2o2 when the initial h2o2 concentration was up to 10 40 mm phenol degraded completely within 10 min with the mineralization level ranging in 90 95 figs s6a and s6b as h2o2 concentration was fixed at 10 mm 80 of phenol and 50 of toc was degraded with 0 25 g l of fe pd c at initial ph 4 when the dosage increased to 0 5 0 75 and 1 0 g l phenol could be degraded within 10 min and the corresponding mineralization was 90 92 and 95 respectively figs s6c and s6d the effect of phenol concentration on phenol disappearance and mineralization was examined with the fixed h2o2 concentration 10 mm and fe pd c dosage 0 5 g l at initial ph 4 the oxidation and mineralization of phenol were negatively influenced by the increased phenol concentration the removal efficiency of phenol was 100 with phenol concentration 0 5 mm and reduced to 90 and 70 with the concentration increased to 1 0 and 1 5 mm respectively fig s6e the mineralization rate of phenols was about 100 90 70 and 40 when the phenol concentration was 0 1 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 mm respectively fig s6f these results suggested that certain h2o2 phenol ratio was necessary for complete elimination of phenol from water samples via fenton oxidation anyway according to the above mentioned results the optimal parameters for efficient phenol removal were 0 5 g l catalyst and 10 mm h2o2 as the concentration of phenol was 0 5 mm at initial ph 4 0 3 3 reusability and stability of the fe pd c catalysts the reusability of the catalysts was checked by recovering the catalysts from reaction mixture and reusing them in the next run the catalysts could be recovered easily under an external magnetic field due to their high saturation magnetization phenol could be eliminated completely within 60 min after reused for five times fig 4 a and the apparent rate constant decreased from 1 426 to 0 139 min 1 in a comparison study the reusability of fe c and the commercial fe c material was also studied at initial ph 3 after recycled four times oxidative degradation of phenol catalyzed by fe c decreased to 75 fig 4b as to the commercial fe c total degradation of phenol was observed within 60 min in the first and second run however the degradation efficiency decreased to 70 40 and 35 within 120 min in the third fourth and fifth run respectively fig 4c we determined the concentration of fe2 and pd ions dissolved in reaction solution as a result low and constant concentration 2 5 mg l 1 of fe2 and absence of pd ions were detected in different runs these results suggested that the core shell structure extended service life of fe pd c and reduced iron sludge for application in most countries discharge limits for total iron are in the range of 0 5 2 mg l 1 georgi et al 2016 the low concentration of fe2 in reaction solution could avoid the production of iron sludge after usage therefore water samples after treatment could be discharged directly into the environment the raw materials of pd precursor used for preparation of fe pd c is far less than the fe precursor mass ratio of the raw material fe pd 100 1 the introduction of pd nps will not enhance the cost of fe pd c greatly furthermore the synthesis of fe pd c by use of ball milling combined carbonization technique does not require high purity chemicals and economical technical grade raw materials can be applied which increases the possibility for industrial production the perfect stability and long service life of fe pd c can improve the wastewater treatment efficiency and reduce the cost of water treatment 3 4 reaction mechanisms in the fe c ime fenton reaction the ime reactions can be illustrated as follows in eqs 1 5 the generated fe2 will catalyze the decomposition of spiked h2o2 to produce hydroxyl free radicals to degrade phenols eqs 6 and 7 in fenton reaction the reduction of fe iii to fe ii by h2o2 or hydroperoxyl radicals superoxide radicals is the rate limiting step eqs 8 and 9 in our previous study we found that pd nps can transfer electrons to fe3o4 nps after fe3o4 nps were oxidized by h2o2 leading to fast regeneration of fe ii niu et al 2018 in this study the xps analysis had shown that the presence of pd nps can slow down the oxidation of highly reactive fe0 in fe pd c during storage which suggested the possible electron transferring from pd nps to fe0 therefore we propose that the trace pd nps help to maintain the reduction ability of fe0 and or facilitate reduction of fe iii to fe ii on catalyst surface and in solution eqs 10 and 11 which contributed to good ph endurance of the fe pd c h2o2 system than the fe c zvi and commercial fe c h2o2 systems the possible reaction mechanisms in fe c ime fenton reaction were described in fig 5 1 anode iron fe s 2e fe2 aq 2 cathode carbon 2h aq 2e 2 h h2 g in aerobic solution at initial ph 4 the following interactions happen on the carbon cathode 3 o2 4h 4e 2h2o 4 o2 2h2o 4e 4oh 5 o2 2h 2e 2h2o2 6 fe ii h2o2 h fe iii oh h2o 7 fe2 aq h2o2 h fe3 aq oh h2o 8 fe3 h2o2 fe2 ho2 h 9 fe3 ho2 fe2 o2 h 10 fe iii e pd nps fe ii 11 fe3 aq e pd nps fe2 aq the role of these reactive species electrons and reactive oxygen species ros oh and ho2 o2 on the degradation of phenol was evaluated by adding different quenchers in reaction solution the results were shown in fig 6 a with the addition of 20 mm of oh quencher t butyl alcohol the degradation efficiency of phenol decreased to 32 within 60 min we used the superoxide dismutase sod as quencher of ho2 o2 radicals and phenol degradation was not affected with the addition of sod in reaction solution arsenate as v was applied as scavengers of electrons generated in ime reaction on the other hand removal of arsenic by zvi was reported mainly based on adsorption and co precipitation by iron hydroxides generated from the corrosion of fe0 guo et al 2016 therefore the effect of as v could reflect the co effect of electrons and surface reaction as a result with 100 mg l 1 of as v phenol degradation efficiency decreased to 18 these findings suggested that oh and electron took a role in phenol degradation and the reaction mainly happened on fe pd c surface the radicals generated in the fe pd c h2o2 system were detected with the electron spin resonance spin trap technique with dmpo without h2o2 there was generally no signal in the fe pd c water suspension and the dmpo oh adduct was identified with the addition of h2o2 fig 6b besides the other main component consisting of six lines was due to the trapping of a carbon centered radical dmpo c by dmpo there was also a small contribution from dmpo h radicals which may arise from the trapping of a hydrogen atom by dmpo or by the reaction of the hydrated electron with the spin trap followed by protonation chignell et al 1994 the dmpo c radicals were observed in the esr spectra of fe c zvi and commercial fe c h2o2 systems as well fig 6c e suggesting that the dmpo c radical was related with the decomposition of dmpo in our previous studies the carbon centered dmpo radical in fenton like reaction suspension with fe3o4 based materials as catalysts was never observed niu et al 2018 thereby the dmpo c radical might imply the strengthened oxidation ability of the microelectrolysis fenton system due to the synergistic effect of electrons hydrogen and ros in reaction suspension fig 6 shows that the intensity of dmpo oh adduct generally did not attenuate in the fe pd c h2o2 system while the esr spectra of dmpo oh nearly disappeared in the fe c zvi and commercial fe c h2o2 systems after reaction for 300 min we detected the disappearance of h2o2 without phenol in these systems and the amount of h2o2 dropped slowly with reaction time and reached zero within 3 h fig 6f the continuous production of oh in the fe pd c h2o2 system when h2o2 had exhausted perfectly proved the function of pd nps to facilitate the transferring of fe3 to fe2 although the amount of pd nps was tiny in the fe pd c catalyst in the presence of phenol drastic increase of dmpo oh adducts in intensity and fast consumption of h2o2 was observed fig 6b and f indicating that organic pollutants could speed up the initiation of ime fenton reaction then the signals of dmpo oh adduct attenuated rapidly with time suggesting the key role of oh radical on phenol degradation the intensities of dmpo h and dmpo c radicals increased as well due to the oxidation of phenol which implied that fenton reaction improved the efficiency of ime 4 conclusions in summary low cost core shell structured hollow fe pd c nanomaterials were synthesized via the fast and simple mechanochemical technique and subsequent carbonization the fe pd c nanomaterials could continuously and lastingly act as iron source for fenton oxidation of phenol due to the internal microelectrolysis between fe0 and carbon components although the concentration of fe2 was below ppm at ph 5 and ph 6 in the fe pd c h2o2 system the reaction still could proceed efficiently and rapidly compared to the commercial fe c material the fe pd c nanomaterials exhibited excellent catalytic performance good stability and extended service life it can be expected that persistent organic pollutants such as halogenated phenols and perfluorinated compounds can be efficiently mineralized by this ime fenton system this study

18640,we have prepared core shell structured hollow fe pd c nanomaterials derived from fe metal organic frameworks which were synthesized via cheap fast and simple mechanochemical technique the obtained fe pd c can steadily and continuously release fe2 from the galvanic corrosion of fe0 anode to trigger h2o2 decomposition into hydroxyl radicals and cause fast 10 min and efficient mineralization rate 95 degradation of phenol the presence of low level of pd nps in fe pd c mass ratio of the raw material fe pd 100 1 facilitated fast fe3 fe2 redox cycle and thus improved the catalytic performance and ph endurance of the fe pd c after recycled four times fe pd c remained high catalytic performance and released low level of iron ions 2 5 mg l 1 which reduced the production of iron sludge after usage in contrast to zero valent iron zvi and commercial physically mixed fe c materials the core shell structure of fe pd c ensured efficient electron transferring from fe0 to carbon cathode and targets and prevented the precipitation of iron ions on fe0 surface avoiding the deactivation of fe0 and termination of fe c internal micro electrolysis ime and extending their service life the reactive species quenching experiments and esr characterization proved the synergistic effect of electrons and hydroxyl free radicals on degradation of phenol the carbon centered dmpo radical detected in reaction solution can be regarded as a proof for the strengthened oxidation ability of the combined ime and fenton reaction graphical abstract image 1 keywords mechanochemical technique fe c internal micro electrolysis fenton reaction phenol degradation 1 introduction zero valent iron activated carbon fe c internal micro electrolysis ime developed as a wastewater treatment technology during the 1970s has been widely used in the treatment of various industrial wastewaters including dyes pharmacy surfactants landfill leachate and toxic metals ju et al 2011 sirés et al 2012 wu et al 2013 zhou et al 2013 zhu et al 2014 2018 zhang et al 2015 2016 wang et al 2016 yang et al 2017 when mixing with granular activated carbon in solution numerous microscopic galvanic cells are formed between the particles of iron anode and carbon cathode the electrons and fe2 are supplied from the galvanic corrosion of fe0 anode and the carbon cathode can accelerate the reduction by accepting electrons and transferring the electrons to proton oxygen or the pollutants organic pollutants can be reduced by electrons free hydrogen h or oxidized by in situ generated h2o2 or ho zhu et al 2014 however the degradation efficiency of organic contaminants by the fe c ime still leaves much to be desired due to the weak oxidation ability of this technology recently in order to improve the wastewater treatment efficiency much attention has been paid to the combination of fe c ime with fenton reaction to mineralize organic pollutants in wastewater the generation of fe2 will trigger subsequent fenton reaction zhang and his coworkers zhang et al 2012 found that the addition of hydrogen peroxide at the end of ime would improve cod removal efficiency therefore fe c particles can be a good alternative as iron source for fenton electro fenton reaction due to its inexpensive price high catalytic activity long life span and easy practical utilization zhang et al 2012 the traditional fe c material is composed of scrap and activated carbon and the ime is usually carried out under acid conditions ph 2 3 to obtain high removal efficiency zhou et al 2013 the increase in ph results in the precipitation of both ferrous ion and ferric ion which blocks the electron transfer between fe0 and activated carbon since the two components are just physically mixed this accounted for the deactivation of the cast iron surface and the termination of ime cheng et al 2017 to solve this problem fe0 particles should combine with the carbon materials to form nanocomposites the full and firm contact of fe0 and carbon may ensure efficient electron transferring from fe0 anode to carbon cathode and subsequent to organic pollutants there are two common strategies for the preparation of composites of carbon materials and metal nanoparticles nps one is to decorate pre obtained carbon materials such as activated carbon carbon nanotubes with metal salts or oxides and then reduce them by chemical methods ju et al 2011 tong et al 2014 the other is the direct pyrolysis of the as prepared mixture under an inert atmosphere where high temperature can induce the carbonization of organic polymers and metal salts or oxides will be converted into metal nps by synchronous carbon thermic reduction ghimbeu et al 2015 yao et al 2016 zeng et al 2017 2018 the latter method is simpler and more useful for industrial scale application as it requires no additional carbon source and involves only a single calcination step qiang et al 2015 metal organic frameworks mofs built out of metal ions and organic ligands represent a class of scalable hybrid porous materials mofs can be converted to porous metal nps carbon heterostructures via simple hydrolysis or pyrolysis recent studies show that fe0 carbon composites derived from fe mofs display a core shell structure and the core shell fe0 c or fe3c c nps embed in the microporous carbon matrix li et al 2015 qiang et al 2015 an et al 2016 if this fe c composite is employed as fe c ime material it can be expected that the erosion of fe0 by oxygen during storage is decreased and precipitation of iron ions on fe0 surface is avoided due to the protection of carbon coat however to the best of our knowledge the mof derived fe c composites have not been used as fe c ime materials to degrade organic pollutants by far mofs are usually synthesized by solvothermal method which is at the laboratory scale and involved in hard reaction conditions mechanochemical method a simple environmental and low cost technology has been widely used in synthesis of advanced materials covered almost all aspects of material science wu et al 2012 during grinding the solids accept mechanical energy from balls and get rupture so the particle sizes of raw materials decrease and specific surface and surface energy increase the grinding process also causes the generation of defects in solids accelerates the migration of defects in the bulk increases the number of contacts between particles and renews the contacts avvakumov et al 2001 therefore the mechanical effects caused by collision can initiate significant structural changes and even chemical reactions in materials mechanochemical approach is a promising alternative for the large scale production of mofs through this technique high yields can be obtained in short reaction times working under mild conditions room temperature ambient pressure using small solvent amounts or even without solvent friščić et al 2010 klimakow et al 2010 pilloni et al 2015 santos et al 2015 užarević et al 2016 in the present study fe mof was synthesized via the simple and green mechanochemical approach and then carbonized in the n2 atmosphere to obtain core shell fe c nanocomposites with suitable fe c ratio trace amount of pd nps was introduced into the fe c composites by adding na2pdcl4 into the mof precursors before grinding the core shell structure and pd nps in fe pd c composites improved the ph endurance of ime fenton reaction extended service life of fe pd c and reduced iron sludge for application 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents and materials titanium sulphate 1 10 phenanthroline

volume of tmaoh after grinding for 1 h fe mofs brown in color were obtained in a comparison study fe mofs were also synthesized via the traditional solvothermal method in dmf solvent at 100 c for 24 h sem images and xrd patterns showed that fe mofs prepared with the two methods possessed similar morphologies and bragg peaks fig s1 indicating the successful synthesis of fe mofs with the simple and fast mechanochemical method the as synthesized fe pd mofs were carbonized at 800 c in n2 atmosphere tem images show that one or two fe pd nps were enwrapped in the hollow carbon coat fig 1 a and b take fe pd 100 1 c as an example the particle size of fe pd nps core and fe pd c was ranged in 8 20 nm and 10 60 nm respectively the carbon coat was about 3 3 6 nm in thickness the hollow fe pd c particles were embedded within larger carbon shell which could greatly improve the stability of metal cores fig 1c in xrd patterns of fe c and fe pd c fig 1d well resolved peaks at 2θ 44 6 and 65 0 can be indexed to the 110 and 200 planes of α fe with a cubic body centered structure jcpds 06 0696 as a common impurity in fe c composites prepared with pyrolysis method considerable amount of fe3c with diffraction peaks at 35 6 37 6 42 8 43 6 45 9 49 1 50 9 and 78 3 qiang et al 2015 was also detected in these materials both α fe and fe3c phases have shown fenton like catalytic ability for organic pollutants removal wang et al 2015 xia et al 2017 the presence of fe3c also can promote the ime due to the potential difference between fe0 anode and fe3c cathode a small peak at 2θ 26 1 pdf no 00 035 0772 was assigned to the 002 plane of graphite this result indicated that the fe c and fe pd c were composed of graphitized carbon fe0 and fe3c in fe pd c the amount of pd nps was too low to observe the characteristic diffraction peaks of pd np in xrd pattern the surface compositions of fe mofs and fe pd mofs with different fe pd ratio and their carbonized samples were studied with xps analysis the o 1s xps lines showed that the o containing functional groups of the nanocomposites decreased greatly after carbonization figs s2a and s2b in the high resolution pd3d xps spectra of the fe pd mofs the pd 3d5 2 peaks centered at 338 4 ev which can be assigned to the pd2 state after carbonization the binding energy of the pd 3d5 2 peaks of all the fe pd c samples shifted to 336 2 ev proving the formation of pd nps fig 2 a and figs s2c and s2d in the fe 2p3 2 xps spectra of fe mofs and fe pd mofs the large and broad peak centered at 712ev represented the fe3 state of iron atoms after carbonization the main peak of fe 2p3 2 line on the surface of fe c moved to 711 6ev which indicated the presence of fe2 species formed due to the oxidation of fe0 surface upon exposure to laboratory air matsuyama et al 2012 for all the fe pd c samples a small peak of α fe at 707 5ev can be observed fig 2b and figs s2e and s2f suggesting that the presence of pd nps can enhance the stability of fe0 and prevent fe0 from oxidation by air in the raman spectra of fe c and fe pd c composites fig 2c a d band at 1339 cm 1 and a g band at 1580 cm 1 can be clearly seen attributing to the disordered amorphous carbon and in plane vibrations of crystalline graphite respectively the high intensity ratio of the d to g band was about 1 1 in the two materials suggesting that the carbon component in fe c and fe pd c composites possessed similar graphitization degree the contents of carbon and iron in nanocomposites were calculated from their tga curves the weight change of the two materials was associated with the oxidation of carbon and fe0 which led to weight loss and weight gain respectively the total weight loss was 18 5 and 20 8 wt for fe c and fe pd c during the oxidation process fig 2d thereby the weight content of fe0 in fe c and fe pd c composites was approximately 57 2 and 56 wt respectively assuming that all fe has transferred to fe2o3 and all c has been burnt out under air atmosphere in the vsm magnetization curves fig s3 of the two materials a hysteresis was observed and the coercivity was 81 07 and 88 30 oe respectively reflecting the ferromagnetic characteristic of these nanoparticles the saturation magnetization of fe c and fe pd c was 155 and 138 emu g respectively which guaranteed that these nanocomposites can be collected from aqueous solution under an external magnetic field after usage the pore structure and specific surface area of the samples were investigated by measuring the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms the brunauere emmette teller bet specific surface area of the obtained fe c and fe pd c composite was 123 2 and 113 5 m2 g 1 respectively in the pore size distribution plots obtained from the nitrogen adsorption data there was one peak located at 1 95 and 1 70 nm for fe c and fe pd c respectively suggesting that the two materials were composed of micropores 3 2 catalytic activity of fe pd c composites in fe c ime fenton reaction the catalytic activity of the fe pd c composites was evaluated based on the fenton degradation of phenol which is often used as model contaminants in wastewater treatment research due to their toxicity and frequent occurrence in environment the preliminary study showed that phenol was eliminated within 10 min as the ratio of fe pd in the catalyst was 100 1 100 2 100 4 and 100 5 when the ratio of fe pd was 100 0 5 total removal of phenol was achieved within 1 h therefore fe pd 100 1 c with low pd content and high catalytic efficiency was selected as the optimal catalyst the phzpc of fe pd c was about ph 5 75 fig s4a the pka of phenol is about 9 98 at ph 3 7 6 phenol exists in neutral undeprotonated form the highest adsorption of phenol on fe pd c obtained as both of them were in the neutral forms about ph 5 and 6 due to the hydrophobic interaction and π π stacking the elimination rate of phenol was about 10 25 in the designed ph range via adsorption fig s4b 3 2 1 effect of solution ph on phenol removal in fe c ime fenton reaction we examined the behavior of fe pd c catalysts in fenton reaction at initial ph 3 7 6 in the presence of h2o2 the degradation efficiency of 0 5 mm of phenol reached 100 at initial ph 3 and 4 within 10 min 99 and 95 within 1 h at initial ph 5 and 6 and 10 at initial ph 7 6 respectively fig 3 a the corresponding apparent rate constant assessed by the pseudo first order kinetics for phenol elimination was 1 433 1 426 0 202 and 0 060 min 1 at initial ph 3 4 5 and 6 respectively the obtained mineralization efficiency of phenols at initial ph 3 6 ranged in 63 6 92 8 fig 3b after reaction the initial solution ph increased to 4 3 6 5 7 5 8 4 and 8 8 respectively which was caused by the ime interaction of the fe pd c catalysts the utilization of h2o2 η in fenton reaction could be evaluated by the ratio of the stoichiometric h2o2 consumption h2o2 s for the pollutant mineralization with the actual h2o2 consumption h2o2 a the h2o2 utilization efficiencies by fe pd c catalysts were 64 9 64 3 62 3 and 44 5 at initial ph 3 4 5 and 6 respectively we measured the production of fe2 at various initial solution phs the concentration of fe2 in 1 h was 32 2 54 0 51 and 0 49 mg l 1 in reaction solution at initial ph 3 4 5 and 6 respectively fig 3c to assess the role of dissolved fe2 ions in solution on phenol degradation different concentration of feso4 0 01 0 1 0 2 0 4 and 0 5 mm was added in deionized water as homogeneous fenton catalyst at initial ph 3 5 to remove phenol with the initial concentration of fe2 0 2 mm phenol could be eliminated totally at initial ph 3 5 fig s5 when the initial concentration of fe2 was 0 1 5 6 mg l 1 and 0 01 mm 0 56 mg l 1 the degradation efficiency in 1 h was 100 81 21 and 10 3 0 at initial ph 3 4 and 5 respectively at initial ph 4 and 5 precipitation of fe oh 3 existed in all these reaction solutions leading to decreased equilibrium solution ph ph 3 5 even when the initial concentration of fe2 was as low as 0 01 mm according to these results we concluded that the dissolved fe2 also contributed to phenol degradation at low initial solution phs however phenol degradation mainly happened on fe pd c surface at ph 5 and 6 comparison study was conducted with fe c zvi and a commercial fe c material as catalysts for fenton degradation of phenols as shown in fig 3d f all the three catalytic systems showed similar oxidative degradation profile of phenol to the fe pd c h2o2 system at initial ph 3 at initial ph 4 elimination of phenol was fast and efficient catalyzed by zvi but retarded significantly and finished within 6 h with a 2 h of lag period catalyzed by fe c and completely stopped in the commercial fe c h2o2 system at initial ph 5 phenol was not degraded in these oxidation systems at initial ph 3 and 4 the fe2 was higher c fe 2 ph3 38 2 mg l 1 and c fe 2 ph4 9 42 mg l 1 leached from zvi and much lower dissolved from fe c c fe 2 ph3 1 36 mg l 1 and c fe 2 ph4 0 75 mg l 1 and the commercial fe c c fe 2 ph3 1 38 mg l 1 and c fe 2 ph4 0 23 mg l 1 compared to fe pd c fig 3c at initial ph 5 and 6 fe2 ions leached from zvi and the commercial fe c were undetectable but low level of fe2 about 0 1 mg l 1 dissolved from fe c was still measured which resulted from the efficient galvanic corrosion of fe0 anode we also made a comparison on the catalytic performance of fe pd c for phenol degradation with other materials reported in literature the results table 1 showed that the degradation and mineralization efficiency of phenol catalyzed by fe pd c in a wider ph range were higher than those obtained with iron oxides and fe clays based catalysts wang et al 2013 yang et al 2013 djeffal et al 2014 tian et al 2017 gao et al 2018 fe pd c exhibited similar catalytic performance and higher stability at low solution ph compared to dendritic fe0 xia et al 2017 3 2 2 effect of h2o2 catalyst dosage and phenol concentration on phenol removal initial h2o2 concentration and catalyst dosage affected significantly on phenols degradation with the fixed phenol concentration 0 5 mm at initial ph 4 phenol disappearance and mineralization level was 63 31 6 and 89 48 4 respectively with 3 and 5 mm of h2o2 when the initial h2o2 concentration was up to 10 40 mm phenol degraded completely within 10 min with the mineralization level ranging in 90 95 figs s6a and s6b as h2o2 concentration was fixed at 10 mm 80 of phenol and 50 of toc was degraded with 0 25 g l of fe pd c at initial ph 4 when the dosage increased to 0 5 0 75 and 1 0 g l phenol could be degraded within 10 min and the corresponding mineralization was 90 92 and 95 respectively figs s6c and s6d the effect of phenol concentration on phenol disappearance and mineralization was examined with the fixed h2o2 concentration 10 mm and fe pd c dosage 0 5 g l at initial ph 4 the oxidation and mineralization of phenol were negatively influenced by the increased phenol concentration the removal efficiency of phenol was 100 with phenol concentration 0 5 mm and reduced to 90 and 70 with the concentration increased to 1 0 and 1 5 mm respectively fig s6e the mineralization rate of phenols was about 100 90 70 and 40 when the phenol concentration was 0 1 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 mm respectively fig s6f these results suggested that certain h2o2 phenol ratio was necessary for complete elimination of phenol from water samples via fenton oxidation anyway according to the above mentioned results the optimal parameters for efficient phenol removal were 0 5 g l catalyst and 10 mm h2o2 as the concentration of phenol was 0 5 mm at initial ph 4 0 3 3 reusability and stability of the fe pd c catalysts the reusability of the catalysts was checked by recovering the catalysts from reaction mixture and reusing them in the next run the catalysts could be recovered easily under an external magnetic field due to their high saturation magnetization phenol could be eliminated completely within 60 min after reused for five times fig 4 a and the apparent rate constant decreased from 1 426 to 0 139 min 1 in a comparison study the reusability of fe c and the commercial fe c material was also studied at initial ph 3 after recycled four times oxidative degradation of phenol catalyzed by fe c decreased to 75 fig 4b as to the commercial fe c total degradation of phenol was observed within 60 min in the first and second run however the degradation efficiency decreased to 70 40 and 35 within 120 min in the third fourth and fifth run respectively fig 4c we determined the concentration of fe2 and pd ions dissolved in reaction solution as a result low and constant concentration 2 5 mg l 1 of fe2 and absence of pd ions were detected in different runs these results suggested that the core shell structure extended service life of fe pd c and reduced iron sludge for application in most countries discharge limits for total iron are in the range of 0 5 2 mg l 1 georgi et al 2016 the low concentration of fe2 in reaction solution could avoid the production of iron sludge after usage therefore water samples after treatment could be discharged directly into the environment the raw materials of pd precursor used for preparation of fe pd c is far less than the fe precursor mass ratio of the raw material fe pd 100 1 the introduction of pd nps will not enhance the cost of fe pd c greatly furthermore the synthesis of fe pd c by use of ball milling combined carbonization technique does not require high purity chemicals and economical technical grade raw materials can be applied which increases the possibility for industrial production the perfect stability and long service life of fe pd c can improve the wastewater treatment efficiency and reduce the cost of water treatment 3 4 reaction mechanisms in the fe c ime fenton reaction the ime reactions can be illustrated as follows in eqs 1 5 the generated fe2 will catalyze the decomposition of spiked h2o2 to produce hydroxyl free radicals to degrade phenols eqs 6 and 7 in fenton reaction the reduction of fe iii to fe ii by h2o2 or hydroperoxyl radicals superoxide radicals is the rate limiting step eqs 8 and 9 in our previous study we found that pd nps can transfer electrons to fe3o4 nps after fe3o4 nps were oxidized by h2o2 leading to fast regeneration of fe ii niu et al 2018 in this study the xps analysis had shown that the presence of pd nps can slow down the oxidation of highly reactive fe0 in fe pd c during storage which suggested the possible electron transferring from pd nps to fe0 therefore we propose that the trace pd nps help to maintain the reduction ability of fe0 and or facilitate reduction of fe iii to fe ii on catalyst surface and in solution eqs 10 and 11 which contributed to good ph endurance of the fe pd c h2o2 system than the fe c zvi and commercial fe c h2o2 systems the possible reaction mechanisms in fe c ime fenton reaction were described in fig 5 1 anode iron fe s 2e fe2 aq 2 cathode carbon 2h aq 2e 2 h h2 g in aerobic solution at initial ph 4 the following interactions happen on the carbon cathode 3 o2 4h 4e 2h2o 4 o2 2h2o 4e 4oh 5 o2 2h 2e 2h2o2 6 fe ii h2o2 h fe iii oh h2o 7 fe2 aq h2o2 h fe3 aq oh h2o 8 fe3 h2o2 fe2 ho2 h 9 fe3 ho2 fe2 o2 h 10 fe iii e pd nps fe ii 11 fe3 aq e pd nps fe2 aq the role of these reactive species electrons and reactive oxygen species ros oh and ho2 o2 on the degradation of phenol was evaluated by adding different quenchers in reaction solution the results were shown in fig 6 a with the addition of 20 mm of oh quencher t butyl alcohol the degradation efficiency of phenol decreased to 32 within 60 min we used the superoxide dismutase sod as quencher of ho2 o2 radicals and phenol degradation was not affected with the addition of sod in reaction solution arsenate as v was applied as scavengers of electrons generated in ime reaction on the other hand removal of arsenic by zvi was reported mainly based on adsorption and co precipitation by iron hydroxides generated from the corrosion of fe0 guo et al 2016 therefore the effect of as v could reflect the co effect of electrons and surface reaction as a result with 100 mg l 1 of as v phenol degradation efficiency decreased to 18 these findings suggested that oh and electron took a role in phenol degradation and the reaction mainly happened on fe pd c surface the radicals generated in the fe pd c h2o2 system were detected with the electron spin resonance spin trap technique with dmpo without h2o2 there was generally no signal in the fe pd c water suspension and the dmpo oh adduct was identified with the addition of h2o2 fig 6b besides the other main component consisting of six lines was due to the trapping of a carbon centered radical dmpo c by dmpo there was also a small contribution from dmpo h radicals which may arise from the trapping of a hydrogen atom by dmpo or by the reaction of the hydrated electron with the spin trap followed by protonation chignell et al 1994 the dmpo c radicals were observed in the esr spectra of fe c zvi and commercial fe c h2o2 systems as well fig 6c e suggesting that the dmpo c radical was related with the decomposition of dmpo in our previous studies the carbon centered dmpo radical in fenton like reaction suspension with fe3o4 based materials as catalysts was never observed niu et al 2018 thereby the dmpo c radical might imply the strengthened oxidation ability of the microelectrolysis fenton system due to the synergistic effect of electrons hydrogen and ros in reaction suspension fig 6 shows that the intensity of dmpo oh adduct generally did not attenuate in the fe pd c h2o2 system while the esr spectra of dmpo oh nearly disappeared in the fe c zvi and commercial fe c h2o2 systems after reaction for 300 min we detected the disappearance of h2o2 without phenol in these systems and the amount of h2o2 dropped slowly with reaction time and reached zero within 3 h fig 6f the continuous production of oh in the fe pd c h2o2 system when h2o2 had exhausted perfectly proved the function of pd nps to facilitate the transferring of fe3 to fe2 although the amount of pd nps was tiny in the fe pd c catalyst in the presence of phenol drastic increase of dmpo oh adducts in intensity and fast consumption of h2o2 was observed fig 6b and f indicating that organic pollutants could speed up the initiation of ime fenton reaction then the signals of dmpo oh adduct attenuated rapidly with time suggesting the key role of oh radical on phenol degradation the intensities of dmpo h and dmpo c radicals increased as well due to the oxidation of phenol which implied that fenton reaction improved the efficiency of ime 4 conclusions in summary low cost core shell structured hollow fe pd c nanomaterials were synthesized via the fast and simple mechanochemical technique and subsequent carbonization the fe pd c nanomaterials could continuously and lastingly act as iron source for fenton oxidation of phenol due to the internal microelectrolysis between fe0 and carbon components although the concentration of fe2 was below ppm at ph 5 and ph 6 in the fe pd c h2o2 system the reaction still could proceed efficiently and rapidly compared to the commercial fe c material the fe pd c nanomaterials exhibited excellent catalytic performance good stability and extended service life it can be expected that persistent organic pollutants such as halogenated phenols and perfluorinated compounds can be efficiently mineralized by this ime fenton system this study

18641,both huge volume and high moisture content of municipal sludge have brought great troubles and attracted extensive concerns in the world in this paper the mechanical press filtration mpf dewatering was performed under ultrahigh pressure in order to improve the dewatering performance of municipal sludge low field nuclear magnetic resonance nmr technique was used to study the effect of mpf parameters on dewatering performance based on the pore characteristics of municipal sludge a capillary bundle model was developed to explore the mesoscopic mechanisms of mpf dewatering the results indicate that moisture content of sludge cake decreases gradually with the increase of compressed pressure and dewatering time as well as the decrease of sludge weight and the moisture content of municipal sludge can be reduced to as low as 30 with mpf dewatering according to the peak and envelope area of relaxation time curve in nmr it can be found that the size of pores decreases and the percentage of small pores increases during the dewatering process therefore the capillary water cannot be removed by mpf method because the capillary pressure in very small pores increases evidently furthermore the compaction degree of the outmost layer is generally higher than that of the middle layer and the difference of moisture content between the middle and outmost layers of cake is 25 28 4

and methods 2 1 experimental apparatus and material municipal sludge consists of various solid particles such as sediment fiber animal and plant residues flocculated floc organic matter metal elements pathogens and eggs etc it is a kind of porous medium with good viscoelasticity and compressibility christensen et al 2015 rao et al 2017 sludge samples were originated from hangzhou qi ge wastewater treatment plant in china which has a capacity of wastewater treatment of 1 2 million tons per day with anaerobic anoxic oxic process these sludge samples were pre dewatered by belt or filter presses through pretreatment with 2 3 kg cationic polyacrylamide cpam per ton of dry sludge and the m c of pre dewatered sludge is approximately 80 the samples were stored at 4 c temperature to avoid transformation of sludge property the ultrahigh pressure uhp dewatering apparatus and low field nmr analyzer are shown in fig 1 the uhp dewatering apparatus is consisted of hydraulic system lifting jack steel chamber filter chamber moving piston upper cover plate filter cloth reinforced cloth pressure controller and filtrate measuring cylinder the diameter of filter chamber is 100 mm and the applied pressure ranges from 0 to 12 mpa which can be controlled by a pressure controller the low field nmr analyzer mesomr23 060h i of suzhou niumag analytical instrument corporation ltd is mainly composed of permanent magnet sample tube radio frequency system data acquisition and analysis system the main parameters of nmr analyzer are listed as follows magnetic field strength 0 5 0 05 t instrument main frequency 21 3 mhz probe coil diameter 60 mm effective sample detection range ø60mm h60mm the experiment process consists of three stages mpf dewatering dispose of sludge cake and nmr measurement at mpf dewatering stage the pre dewatered sludge was put into the steel chamber of uhp apparatus on which the upper cover plate was fixed the moving piston was promoted upward by hydraulic system and lifting jack the sludge sample was compressed under pressure and sludge cake was formed when the dewatering stage finished the filtrate discharged from sludge flowed out through the small hole in moving piston which was collected as well as measured in the filtrate measuring cylinder at cake dispose stage sludge cake was cut into halves symmetrically for two series of experiments one was used to measure the m c of cake by oven dry method and the other one was made into small round pieces for nmr experiments at last the small round pieces were scanned and measured by nmr analyzer the relaxation time t 2 distribution curves for each small round pieces were drawn and processed in software 2 2 method and parameters setting single factor method was used in this paper to study the effect of different mpf parameters and conditions including compressed pressure p c dewatering time t d weight of sludge w s and pressurization mode etc on the dewatering performance in order to provide guidelines for actual production the treatment rate t r was studied as well it is defined by 1 t r w s t d the dewatering performance of two series of treatment rate variable t r and constant t r were studied for the variable t r different weight of sludge was dewatered by the same t d for instance 100g 150g 200g 250g and 300g sludge were dewatered with the same t d of 90 min then the t r varies from 1 11 g min to 3 33 g min while the constant t r was considered as the w s was proportional to t d 100g 150g 200g 250g and 300g sludge were dewatered with t d of 30 min 45 min 60 min 75 min and 90 min respectively at this time t r is constant with a value of 3 33 g min to investigate the performance of different pressurization modes on the dewatering process of sludge press directly pd mode and press step by step ps mode were designed for pd mode 10 mpa pressure was directly imposed on the sludge cake and maintained for 60 min whereas ps mode began at 2 mpa and then increased the pressure successively to 4 mpa 6 mpa 8 mpa and 10 mpa where each pressure mode was maintained for 12 min during the dewatering process the filtrate was collected in a measuring cylinder and the filtration data was recorded every 2 min the dewatering process continued until no more than two drops of filtrate were collected within 15 min 1 h if necessary then the transient filtration data could be obtained feng et al 2014 parameters of different number of test no were shown in table 1 low field nmr as a rapid non invasive method was used to determine the pore size distribution jin et al 2013 milia et al 1998 the distribution of pore size in sludge cake was mainly measured by testing the t 2 of water in sludge pores with nmr technology the nmr measurements of longitudinal and transverse t 2 and its multidimensional correlations provide useful information about molecular dynamics the t 2 value of pore water in sludge is closely related to its pore construction the relationship is defined by 2 1 t 2 ρ 2 r where t 2 is the relaxation time ρ is the transverse relaxation rate which is related to the chemical property of sludge r is the radius of pore higher value of t 2 represents a larger pore size wang et al 2018 tian et al 2014a b yao et al 2014 therefore the size of interstitial pore can be reflected by t 2 distribution and the content of interstitial water is shown by the area of peaks in t 2 distribution carr purcell meiboom gill cpmg and spin echo single point imaging se spi were performed to detect the t 2 distribution curves and its value of different layer the main operation parameters of nmr measurement were shown in table 2 with experiment of nmr 1 sludge cakes compressed under different dewatering conditions were measured with experiment of nmr 2 the moisture distribution in different cake layer was obtained according to the t 2 value of different layer the small round piece originated from the dewatered sludge cake was put into a test tube it was divided non destructively into different layers with the thickness of 0 8 mm nmr signal distribution in different cake layer was obtained and produced and the average t 2 value and weight of water in different layer were obtained accordingly in this study oven dry and nmr methods were used to measure m c and compared with each other oven dry method is commonly used for m c measurement of sludge which is defined by 3 m c 2 w 1 w 2 w 1 100 where m c2 is the moisture content of sludge cake by oven dry method w 1 is the weight of wet sludge cake and w 2 is the weight of dry sludge cake after drying at 105 c for 24 h calibration curve was constructed by the linear fitting of the known m c of several standard samples and its amplitude before nmr measurement the weight of water and the moisture content m c1 of sludge sample were calculated as substituting the amplitude of sludge sample whose weight was known into the calibration curve the error between these two methods is defined by 4 e m c 1 m c 2 m c 1 100 where e is the relative error between these two methods m c1 is the moisture content by nmr measurement fig 2 a shows that there is a good correlation between weight of water and amplitude fig 2 b represents the difference of m c measured by two methods it can be found that the average error between the oven dry and nmr method is about 0 1 therefore nmr method can be recognized as a reliable and convenient method for m c measurement because of its high reliability and quick measurement of 120s 180s for each test sample 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of mpf parameters the transient filtration during the dewatering process was carried out under different applied pressures fig 3 a presents the weight of filtrate at different time it can be seen clearly that large amount of filtrate discharge within the first 2 min and the filtrate weight drops to 4 6g in the following 2 min and it subsequently reduces slowly it is also found from fig 3 b that the collected filtrate is concentrated in the first half an hour and it approaches to 0 after 60 min under various applied pressures therefore the dewatering time up to 120 min was used for the following investigations it should be noted that the filtration rate slows significantly and the sludge cake may require days to filter to completion thus the sludge cake has approximately achieved to equilibrium after 120 min dewatering the pre dewatered sludge samples of 100g were compressed by different p c for 60 min and t 2 distribution curves for sludge cakes were shown in fig 4 a the p c of 10 mpa was applied to 100g pre dewatered sludge for 10 min 30 min 60 min and 120 min respectively the t 2 distribution curves were shown in fig 4 b and m c of cakes were measured and shown in fig 2 b as shown in fig 4 t 2 distribution curve is composed of two continuous peaks one little peak around 0 01 ms 1 ms one large peak between 1 ms and 100 ms because the type and appearance of peak is related to the pore size of sample it can be deduced that there are two types of pores in the sludge cake a small one and a large one according to the peak area of the curve the ratio of large and small pores can be determined the result for the case under p c 2 mpa and t d 60 min black curve in fig 4 a shows that the area of the first peak is 10 98 of whole area and the second peak is 89 02 which indicates that the percent of small and large pores in the sludge cake is 10 98 and 89 02 respectively while the percent of small and large pores in sludge cake under p c 10 mpa and t d 60 min red curve in fig 4 a is 14 77 and 85 23 respectively with the increase of p c and t d it can be found from fig 4 that the percent of small pores increases and that for large pores decreases furthermore with the increase of p c and t d both peak location and area of t 2 distribution curve decrease it indicates that the sludge cake is highly compressed and m c of cake is reducing from the mesoscopic perspective the mobility of water molecular in sludge is weakening due to the narrowed discharge channel and increased resistance of discharge also the reduction of large peak area in t 2 distribution curve is much smaller than that of small one which indicates that the discharge and reduction of moisture in large pore has a priority thus the moisture in large pore is discharged first as large pore is turned into small one it can be clearly seen in fig 4 a that t 2 distribution curves are very close to each other when the pressure increases to 8 mpa and 10 mpa separately it can be deduced that the influence of pressure on m c and internal structure of cake is marginal when it increases to a certain extent as shown in fig 4 b the dewatering time takes significant effect on t 2 distribution curves therefore prolonging dewatering time is more beneficial to dewatering performance than increasing pressure over a certain value fig 5 a and b represent t 2 distribution curves under variable and constant t r respectively when t r increases from 1 11 g min to 3 33 g min m c of cake decreases from 63 93 to 31 02 and the thickness of cake decreases from 19 28 mm to 3 02 mm under constant t r t r 3 33 g min m c of cake decreases from 63 93 to 49 04 as the weight of sludge reduces from 300g to 100g therefore it is an effective method to lower m c by reducing weight of sludge under constant t r this method is defined as thin cake press filtration tcpf dewatering method and has important practical application value for high dry dewatering of sludge dewatering performances of two pressurization modes were also investigated the m c of dewatered sludge cake under pd mode and ps mode are 37 44 and 37 6 respectively as shown in fig 6 t 2 distribution curves are almost coincident it can be found that the effect of pressurization modes on the dewatering performance is not evident therefore ps mode is preferred due to the advantages of energy saving and low treatment cost 3 2 moisture distribution the moisture distribution in different layer of cake was examined by nmr two typical sludge cakes with thicknesses of 8 26 mm and 15 5 mm were presented figs 7 and 8 represent the moisture content and average avg t 2 in different layer for the two sludge cakes the results show that the weight of water in the middle layer is largest while it is smallest in the outermost layer the weight of water in the middle layer of 8 26 mm cake is 0 32g and the weight of water in outermost layer is 0 24g which is 25 lower than that of middle layer for 15 5 mm cake the weight of water in the middle layer is up to 0 331g while the weight of water in the outermost layer is 0 237g which is 28 4 lower than that of middle layer this means that with the increasing of cake thickness the difference of weight of water between the middle layer and the outermost layer increases it should be pointed out that the moisture content components of the lower half of the sludge cake is slightly higher than that of upper half due to the gravity effect and vertical structure of uhp apparatus the sludge compaction degree can be measured by its average value of t 2 fig 7 b and 8 b indicate that the compaction degree of sludge cakes is not uniform along the thickness direction the outer layer is more compact than the inner layer the water flow path and compaction degree model of sludge cake was proposed and shown in fig 9 to illustrate the nonuniform moisture distribution in different layers of cake there are two major reasons contributing to this nonuniform moisture distribution the first one is the water flow path from the middle to border is more tortuous according to hagen poiseuille equation the volumetric flow rate through a capillary with radius of r can be written as 5 q π r 4 8 μ δ p l t where l t is the actual length of flow path which is generally larger that the straight length l it can be deduced form eq 5 that the flow rate reduces with the increment of actual length thus the flow resistance for the water at middle layer is larger and the flow rate is smaller than that of top and bottom water it can be concluded that extra strategy should be applied to reduce the moisture content in the middle of sludge cake the other reason for the nonuniform moisture distribution in different sludge layers is that sludge compaction degree the smaller average value of t 2 is the higher sludge compaction degree is the outer layer is more compact than the middle layer the water in middle layer is hindered by the compact outer layer and difficult to discharge while the water in outer layer is easily discharged 3 3 pore structure the distribution of particle and pore size is supposed to be one of the key factors in sludge dewaterability neyens and baeyens 2003 ye et al 2012 xu 2015 the changes of pore size and construction are significant during the process of dewatering wang et al 2017 it has been reported that the resistance of the filter medium measured by nmr was higher than theoretical expectations la heji et al 1996a b in this paper nmr technology was used to measure pore size and its change during the process of dewatering table 3 shows the pore size distribution under different p c and t d and fig 10 shows the pore size distribution with different w s and t r the results show that the radius of most pores is less than 4 μm when p c exceeds 2 mpa and the percent of pores with size less than 0 4 μm are 33 34 and 51 93 under pressure of 2 mpa and 10 mpa respectively with the increase of p c both pore size and percent of large pores decrease the similar phenomenon can be found for increased t d the proportion of pore size between 0 and 0 1 μm are 6 82 and 23 61 with dewatering time of 10 min and 120 min respectively fig 10 shows that the porosity increases with the increase of w s the change trend of porosity is in accordance with that of m c the pore size and porosity of sludge have important influence on the driving and resistance forces of water discharge and m c of cake therefore it is of great significance to study the effect of sludge pore size distribution on the performance of dewatering as p c increases the porosity and percentage of large pores in sludge decrease evidently during the first period of dewatering free water inside the porous sludge is removed from the macro pores and capillaries the dewatering rate falls down with the reduction of pore space it can be explained that the permeability of porous sludge decreases with the decrease of porosity according to kozeny carman equation xu and yu 2008 then the retreating of meniscuses between liquid and gas phases may occur in next stage of dewatering as shown in fig 11 a the porous sludge can be represented by a bundle of capillaries with a radius distribution xu et al 2013 2016 2017 according to young laplace equation the capillary pressure in liquid bridges between adjoining particles shown in fig 11 b can be expressed as kowalski 2003 6 p c γ 1 r 1 1 r 2 where γ is the liquid surface tension r 1 and r 2 denote principal radius of curvature the capillary pressure can be negative inside the liquid bridge as r 2 r 1 therefore the capillary pressure will add resistance for liquid flow through pores in sludge the effective capillary pressure at capillary with radius of r can be estimated by 7 p c 2 γ cos θ r where θ is the wetting angle of the liquid on the surface of capillary if the gravitational pressure is neglected the total pressure drop can be expressed as 8 δ p p m p c where p m and p c are the applied mechanical injection pressure and capillary pressure respectively the dewatering content can be evaluated by darcy s law 9 q k μ a δ p l where k is the permeability of porous sludge μ is fluid viscosity a and l are the cross section area of porous sample and straight length along the macroscopic pressure gradient direction respectively since the capillary pressure is negative for small capillaries the liquid pressure should be larger than the absolute value of capillary pressure in order to remove the liquid content from porous sludge in order to estimate the capillary pressure the surface tension γ 0 07275 n m and contact angle θ 0 are used for water at 20 c o according to the pore size distribution the capillary pressures for capillary radii of 0 01455 μm 0 1 μm and 1 0 μm are 10 mpa 1 45 mpa and 0 145 mpa respectively therefore the capillary water in small capillaries pores cannot be removed by mpf method it should be noted that the internal bound water and some adsorbed water cannot be removed by mpf method either 4 conclusion the effects of mpf parameters including p c t d w s t r and pressurization mode on the dewatering performance and pore structures of sludge cake were studied the moisture distribution in different layer of sludge cake was measured and a physical model of water flow path and compaction degree as well as capillary bundle model were proposed to explain the limitation of dewatering effect by mpf based on t 2 distribution curve of low field nmr technology the pore size distribution and porosity of sludge cake during dewatering process were presented in this paper results show that with increase of p c and t d as well as decrease of w s the envelope area of t 2 spectrum decreases and m c can be reduced to as low as 30 under certain mpf parameters in the process of dewatering moisture in large pore is discharged first and pore size as well as percent of large pores reduce the proposed capillary bundle model indicates that the capillary water in small capillaries pores cannot be discharged by mpf method as the capillary pressure is comparable with that of applied pressure also the difference of moisture content between different layers along compression direction increases accompany with the increment of sludge cake s thickness it is confirmed that m c is not only related to the mpf parameters but also the internal filtrate discharge channels and compaction degree the present work may shed light on the meso mechanism of mpf dewatering of municipal sludge and provide

varies from 1 11 g min to 3 33 g min while the constant t r was considered as the w s was proportional to t d 100g 150g 200g 250g and 300g sludge were dewatered with t d of 30 min 45 min 60 min 75 min and 90 min respectively at this time t r is constant with a value of 3 33 g min to investigate the performance of different pressurization modes on the dewatering process of sludge press directly pd mode and press step by step ps mode were designed for pd mode 10 mpa pressure was directly imposed on the sludge cake and maintained for 60 min whereas ps mode began at 2 mpa and then increased the pressure successively to 4 mpa 6 mpa 8 mpa and 10 mpa where each pressure mode was maintained for 12 min during the dewatering process the filtrate was collected in a measuring cylinder and the filtration data was recorded every 2 min the dewatering process continued until no more than two drops of filtrate were collected within 15 min 1 h if necessary then the transient filtration data could be obtained feng et al 2014 parameters of different number of test no were shown in table 1 low field nmr as a rapid non invasive method was used to determine the pore size distribution jin et al 2013 milia et al 1998 the distribution of pore size in sludge cake was mainly measured by testing the t 2 of water in sludge pores with nmr technology the nmr measurements of longitudinal and transverse t 2 and its multidimensional correlations provide useful information about molecular dynamics the t 2 value of pore water in sludge is closely related to its pore construction the relationship is defined by 2 1 t 2 ρ 2 r where t 2 is the relaxation time ρ is the transverse relaxation rate which is related to the chemical property of sludge r is the radius of pore higher value of t 2 represents a larger pore size wang et al 2018 tian et al 2014a b yao et al 2014 therefore the size of interstitial pore can be reflected by t 2 distribution and the content of interstitial water is shown by the area of peaks in t 2 distribution carr purcell meiboom gill cpmg and spin echo single point imaging se spi were performed to detect the t 2 distribution curves and its value of different layer the main operation parameters of nmr measurement were shown in table 2 with experiment of nmr 1 sludge cakes compressed under different dewatering conditions were measured with experiment of nmr 2 the moisture distribution in different cake layer was obtained according to the t 2 value of different layer the small round piece originated from the dewatered sludge cake was put into a test tube it was divided non destructively into different layers with the thickness of 0 8 mm nmr signal distribution in different cake layer was obtained and produced and the average t 2 value and weight of water in different layer were obtained accordingly in this study oven dry and nmr methods were used to measure m c and compared with each other oven dry method is commonly used for m c measurement of sludge which is defined by 3 m c 2 w 1 w 2 w 1 100 where m c2 is the moisture content of sludge cake by oven dry method w 1 is the weight of wet sludge cake and w 2 is the weight of dry sludge cake after drying at 105 c for 24 h calibration curve was constructed by the linear fitting of the known m c of several standard samples and its amplitude before nmr measurement the weight of water and the moisture content m c1 of sludge sample were calculated as substituting the amplitude of sludge sample whose weight was known into the calibration curve the error between these two methods is defined by 4 e m c 1 m c 2 m c 1 100 where e is the relative error between these two methods m c1 is the moisture content by nmr measurement fig 2 a shows that there is a good correlation between weight of water and amplitude fig 2 b represents the difference of m c measured by two methods it can be found that the average error between the oven dry and nmr method is about 0 1 therefore nmr method can be recognized as a reliable and convenient method for m c measurement because of its high reliability and quick measurement of 120s 180s for each test sample 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of mpf parameters the transient filtration during the dewatering process was carried out under different applied pressures fig 3 a presents the weight of filtrate at different time it can be seen clearly that large amount of filtrate discharge within the first 2 min and the filtrate weight drops to 4 6g in the following 2 min and it subsequently reduces slowly it is also found from fig 3 b that the collected filtrate is concentrated in the first half an hour and it approaches to 0 after 60 min under various applied pressures therefore the dewatering time up to 120 min was used for the following investigations it should be noted that the filtration rate slows significantly and the sludge cake may require days to filter to completion thus the sludge cake has approximately achieved to equilibrium after 120 min dewatering the pre dewatered sludge samples of 100g were compressed by different p c for 60 min and t 2 distribution curves for sludge cakes were shown in fig 4 a the p c of 10 mpa was applied to 100g pre dewatered sludge for 10 min 30 min 60 min and 120 min respectively the t 2 distribution curves were shown in fig 4 b and m c of cakes were measured and shown in fig 2 b as shown in fig 4 t 2 distribution curve is composed of two continuous peaks one little peak around 0 01 ms 1 ms one large peak between 1 ms and 100 ms because the type and appearance of peak is related to the pore size of sample it can be deduced that there are two types of pores in the sludge cake a small one and a large one according to the peak area of the curve the ratio of large and small pores can be determined the result for the case under p c 2 mpa and t d 60 min black curve in fig 4 a shows that the area of the first peak is 10 98 of whole area and the second peak is 89 02 which indicates that the percent of small and large pores in the sludge cake is 10 98 and 89 02 respectively while the percent of small and large pores in sludge cake under p c 10 mpa and t d 60 min red curve in fig 4 a is 14 77 and 85 23 respectively with the increase of p c and t d it can be found from fig 4 that the percent of small pores increases and that for large pores decreases furthermore with the increase of p c and t d both peak location and area of t 2 distribution curve decrease it indicates that the sludge cake is highly compressed and m c of cake is reducing from the mesoscopic perspective the mobility of water molecular in sludge is weakening due to the narrowed discharge channel and increased resistance of discharge also the reduction of large peak area in t 2 distribution curve is much smaller than that of small one which indicates that the discharge and reduction of moisture in large pore has a priority thus the moisture in large pore is discharged first as large pore is turned into small one it can be clearly seen in fig 4 a that t 2 distribution curves are very close to each other when the pressure increases to 8 mpa and 10 mpa separately it can be deduced that the influence of pressure on m c and internal structure of cake is marginal when it increases to a certain extent as shown in fig 4 b the dewatering time takes significant effect on t 2 distribution curves therefore prolonging dewatering time is more beneficial to dewatering performance than increasing pressure over a certain value fig 5 a and b represent t 2 distribution curves under variable and constant t r respectively when t r increases from 1 11 g min to 3 33 g min m c of cake decreases from 63 93 to 31 02 and the thickness of cake decreases from 19 28 mm to 3 02 mm under constant t r t r 3 33 g min m c of cake decreases from 63 93 to 49 04 as the weight of sludge reduces from 300g to 100g therefore it is an effective method to lower m c by reducing weight of sludge under constant t r this method is defined as thin cake press filtration tcpf dewatering method and has important practical application value for high dry dewatering of sludge dewatering performances of two pressurization modes were also investigated the m c of dewatered sludge cake under pd mode and ps mode are 37 44 and 37 6 respectively as shown in fig 6 t 2 distribution curves are almost coincident it can be found that the effect of pressurization modes on the dewatering performance is not evident therefore ps mode is preferred due to the advantages of energy saving and low treatment cost 3 2 moisture distribution the moisture distribution in different layer of cake was examined by nmr two typical sludge cakes with thicknesses of 8 26 mm and 15 5 mm were presented figs 7 and 8 represent the moisture content and average avg t 2 in different layer for the two sludge cakes the results show that the weight of water in the middle layer is largest while it is smallest in the outermost layer the weight of water in the middle layer of 8 26 mm cake is 0 32g and the weight of water in outermost layer is 0 24g which is 25 lower than that of middle layer for 15 5 mm cake the weight of water in the middle layer is up to 0 331g while the weight of water in the outermost layer is 0 237g which is 28 4 lower than that of middle layer this means that with the increasing of cake thickness the difference of weight of water between the middle layer and the outermost layer increases it should be pointed out that the moisture content components of the lower half of the sludge cake is slightly higher than that of upper half due to the gravity effect and vertical structure of uhp apparatus the sludge compaction degree can be measured by its average value of t 2 fig 7 b and 8 b indicate that the compaction degree of sludge cakes is not uniform along the thickness direction the outer layer is more compact than the inner layer the water flow path and compaction degree model of sludge cake was proposed and shown in fig 9 to illustrate the nonuniform moisture distribution in different layers of cake there are two major reasons contributing to this nonuniform moisture distribution the first one is the water flow path from the middle to border is more tortuous according to hagen poiseuille equation the volumetric flow rate through a capillary with radius of r can be written as 5 q π r 4 8 μ δ p l t where l t is the actual length of flow path which is generally larger that the straight length l it can be deduced form eq 5 that the flow rate reduces with the increment of actual length thus the flow resistance for the water at middle layer is larger and the flow rate is smaller than that of top and bottom water it can be concluded that extra strategy should be applied to reduce the moisture content in the middle of sludge cake the other reason for the nonuniform moisture distribution in different sludge layers is that sludge compaction degree the smaller average value of t 2 is the higher sludge compaction degree is the outer layer is more compact than the middle layer the water in middle layer is hindered by the compact outer layer and difficult to discharge while the water in outer layer is easily discharged 3 3 pore structure the distribution of particle and pore size is supposed to be one of the key factors in sludge dewaterability neyens and baeyens 2003 ye et al 2012 xu 2015 the changes of pore size and construction are significant during the process of dewatering wang et al 2017 it has been reported that the resistance of the filter medium measured by nmr was higher than theoretical expectations la heji et al 1996a b in this paper nmr technology was used to measure pore size and its change during the process of dewatering table 3 shows the pore size distribution under different p c and t d and fig 10 shows the pore size distribution with different w s and t r the results show that the radius of most pores is less than 4 μm when p c exceeds 2 mpa and the percent of pores with size less than 0 4 μm are 33 34 and 51 93 under pressure of 2 mpa and 10 mpa respectively with the increase of p c both pore size and percent of large pores decrease the similar phenomenon can be found for increased t d the proportion of pore size between 0 and 0 1 μm are 6 82 and 23 61 with dewatering time of 10 min and 120 min respectively fig 10 shows that the porosity increases with the increase of w s the change trend of porosity is in accordance with that of m c the pore size and porosity of sludge have important influence on the driving and resistance forces of water discharge and m c of cake therefore it is of great significance to study the effect of sludge pore size distribution on the performance of dewatering as p c increases the porosity and percentage of large pores in sludge decrease evidently during the first period of dewatering free water inside the porous sludge is removed from the macro pores and capillaries the dewatering rate falls down with the reduction of pore space it can be explained that the permeability of porous sludge decreases with the decrease of porosity according to kozeny carman equation xu and yu 2008 then the retreating of meniscuses between liquid and gas phases may occur in next stage of dewatering as shown in fig 11 a the porous sludge can be represented by a bundle of capillaries with a radius distribution xu et al 2013 2016 2017 according to young laplace equation the capillary pressure in liquid bridges between adjoining particles shown in fig 11 b can be expressed as kowalski 2003 6 p c γ 1 r 1 1 r 2 where γ is the liquid surface tension r 1 and r 2 denote principal radius of curvature the capillary pressure can be negative inside the liquid bridge as r 2 r 1 therefore the capillary pressure will add resistance for liquid flow through pores in sludge the effective capillary pressure at capillary with radius of r can be estimated by 7 p c 2 γ cos θ r where θ is the wetting angle of the liquid on the surface of capillary if the gravitational pressure is neglected the total pressure drop can be expressed as 8 δ p p m p c where p m and p c are the applied mechanical injection pressure and capillary pressure respectively the dewatering content can be evaluated by darcy s law 9 q k μ a δ p l where k is the permeability of porous sludge μ is fluid viscosity a and l are the cross section area of porous sample and straight length along the macroscopic pressure gradient direction respectively since the capillary pressure is negative for small capillaries the liquid pressure should be larger than the absolute value of capillary pressure in order to remove the liquid content from porous sludge in order to estimate the capillary pressure the surface tension γ 0 07275 n m and contact angle θ 0 are used for water at 20 c o according to the pore size distribution the capillary pressures for capillary radii of 0 01455 μm 0 1 μm and 1 0 μm are 10 mpa 1 45 mpa and 0 145 mpa respectively therefore the capillary water in small capillaries pores cannot be removed by mpf method it should be noted that the internal bound water and some adsorbed water cannot be removed by mpf method either 4 conclusion the effects of mpf parameters including p c t d w s t r and pressurization mode on the dewatering performance and pore structures of sludge cake were studied the moisture distribution in different layer of sludge cake was measured and a physical model of water flow path and compaction degree as well as capillary bundle model were proposed to explain the limitation of dewatering effect by mpf based on t 2 distribution curve of low field nmr technology the pore size distribution and porosity of sludge cake during dewatering process were presented in this paper results show that with increase of p c and t d as well as decrease of w s the envelope area of t 2 spectrum decreases and m c can be reduced to as low as 30 under certain mpf parameters in the process of dewatering moisture in large pore is discharged first and pore size as well as percent of large pores reduce the proposed capillary bundle model indicates that the capillary water in small capillaries pores cannot be discharged by mpf method as the capillary pressure is comparable with that of applied pressure also the difference of moisture content between different layers along compression direction increases accompany with the increment of sludge cake s thickness it is confirmed that m c is not only related to the mpf parameters but also the internal filtrate discharge channels and compaction degree the present work may shed light on the meso mechanism of mpf dewatering of municipal sludge and provide

18642,the present work aimed to assess the sorption capacity of the common white bean phaseolus vulgaris l to remove zn ii from rainwater rendering it suitable for use in buildings and the efficiency of the process was evaluated for two initial zn ii concentrations representing high 100 μg l 1 and very high 500 μg l 1 levels of zn ii in rainwater the effects of the amount of beans 1 5 and 10 beans per 50 ml as well as the initial ph values of the zinc solution acid 4 neutral 5 6 and basic 7 for atmospheric waters were also assessed the removal of zn from water was affected by the change in ph values when 5 and 10 beans were used after 4 h and 2 h of contact time respectively the accumulated zn ii on the beans was released back into the solution and this release occurred first for the highest tested ph value the sorption rate of zn ii from the solution increased with the increasing amount of beans but for 5 and 10 beans this only took place up to 4 h and 2 h respectively furthermore the removal percentages of zn ii increased with the increase of the initial concentrations of the metal in water kinetic studies revealed that a pseudo first order model provided the best fitting for the experimentally obtained values fourier transform infrared spectroscopy coupled with attenuated total reflectance ftir atr analyses of the bean shells and cores indicated that contact with a zn ii solution did not cause notable alterations to the chemical structures of these bean components scanning electron microscopy sem and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx analyses suggested that the process of sorption occurred at the surface of the beans shells the results obtained in this study also suggest that the matrix of rainwater samples did not interfere with the removal of metal and that the process of the removal of zn ii by the white beans can be applied to real samples on the whole results indicate that for the removal of zn ii from rainwater 1 bean up to 6 h or 5 and 10 beans up to 2 h can be used per 50 ml for the removal of up to 60 of zn ii present in water thus constituting a viable solution for the effective reduction of this metal in rainwater graphical abstract image 1 keywords sorption zinc white bean biosorbent rainwater 1 introduction climate change urban development and higher water consumption rates are commonly acknowledged factors presently putting stress on existing fresh water resources thus the scarcity of fresh water all over the world hoekstra et al 2012 highlights the need to find alternative water resources and the possibility of reusing rainwater as a way to overcome this issue has been suggested in the past angrill et al 2017 in fact various studies have evidenced the potential of harvesting rainwater for domestic purposes simmons et al 2001 busset et al 2011 moreover the rooftops represent an important percentage of impermeable area in urban zones offering a significant possibility for rainwater collection which may be reused in buildings however although rainwater may be considered in the first instance as distilled water several types of chemical contaminants have been found in harvested rainwater such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and pesticides basheer et al 2003 as well as heavy metals santos et al 2008 thus for reusing rainwater in buildings the removal of such contaminants should be performed in order to safeguard human health the european union eu does not have specific legislation or guidelines for the reuse of rainwater in buildings but the legislation for drinking water council directive 98 83 ec can be used as a reference point certainly ensuring the safety of such treated waters from the potentially toxic elements zinc has been recurrently found as a major metal present in rainwater chon et al 2015 omrani et al 2017 furthermore various studies in different parts of the world have showed that rainwater frequently exhibits high levels of zinc e g santos et al 2008 chon et al 2015 omrani et al 2017 some of those much higher than the levels recommended for drinking water namely in portugal according to the portuguese legislation water for human consumption must have a zn ii concentration lower than 5 0 μg l 1 portuguese decree law n º 236 98 however the eu legislation for drinking water council directive 98 83 ec does not specify the recommended maximum level for zinc allowing this parameter to be legislated by each member state as zinc may have toxic effects on human health including fever and gastrointestinal distress world health organization 1996 its presence in rainwater becomes a matter of concern when its intended use is in buildings highlighting that rainwater must undergo treatment for metal removal before its use the removal of contaminants from rainwater requires a methodology that makes use of materials able to retain the contaminants to the best of our knowledge few materials have been tested for the retention of contaminants from rainwater peat cho et al 2014 tecomella leaves brahman et al 2016 fe3o4 mof 235 fe oso3h moradi et al 2016 zeolite na nano fe gan et al 2012 and activated carbon kus et

sorption of aromatic pollutants however only activated carbon was tested for the removal of zinc from rainwater and showed not to be efficient kus et al 2013b biosorption is a biotechnological innovation with the potential for the removal of contaminants from water due to the ability of biomaterials to accumulate contaminants via metabolically independent mediated or physicochemical pathways fomina and gadd 2014 furthermore biomaterials can be non hazardous and readily available from cheap sources various biosorbents have been studied for the removal of contaminants from water such as bacteria including both gram positive and gram negative bacteria as well as cyanobacteria fungi e g mushrooms yeast algae e g micro algae and macro algae industrial wastes e g fermentation and food wastes activated and anaerobic sludges agricultural wastes e g fruit vegetable wastes rice straw wheat bran soybean hulls natural residues e g plant residues sawdust tree barks weeds and other materials e g chitosan cellulose park et al 2010 furthermore some biomaterials such as fungi bacteria and algae were already tested for the removal of zinc from residual coastal and esturine waters e g aftab et al 2013 mameri et al 1999 saiano et al 2005 suzuki et al 2005 however as rainwater is considered a clean water the biomaterial chosen for the removal of contaminants should not introduce additional organic and or inorganic compounds other than those already present the aim of this study was to assess the sorption efficiency of the common white bean phaseolus vulgaris l to remove zn ii from rainwater under realistic conditions and concentrations this biomaterial was chosen because it is cheap and can be easily separated from water after treatment allowing its use as a homemade method for rainwater treatment and subsequent reuse of this type of water in buildings namely for domestic purposes in this study the following effects were evaluated the initial ph of water containing zinc acid neutral and basic ph values for rainwater the sorbent amount three masses the initial concentrations of metal in water two concentrations representing very high and high levels of zinc in rainwater and the contact time between sorbent and water containing zinc some experiments were also performed on real rainwater samples the variation of zinc concentration in the water was evaluated using atomic absorption spectroscopy aas and kinetic sorption studies were carried out chemical structural and morphological features of the white beans tested along the process of sorption were also evaluated using fourier transform infrared ftir atr spectroscopy scanning electron microscopy sem and electron dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx 2 material and methods 2 1 biosorbent preparation the white beans used were phaseolus vulgaris l and were acquired from a large commercial retailer the need to wash the beans prior to their use due to the possibility of releasing organic matter into the water was assessed analyzing the water after different contact periods with the beans 1 h 2 h and 4 h by uv vis washed beans were rinsed with ultrapure water three times and then dried in an oven at 30 c during 2 h 4 h or 24 h in the other hand the unwashed white beans were not subjected to any treatment following their removal from the original packaging then 2 6 g of sorbent equivalent to 5 beans were added to 50 ml of ultrapure water at 100 ml erlenmeyer flasks and inserted in an incubator at 22 c with agitation at 150 rpm and in the absence of light the uv vis results see supplementary material sm fig sm 1 showed that up to 4 h of contact of the beans with the water the washed white beans dried at 30 c during 4 h and 24 h were the most suitable for the purpose of this work for this reason throughout the posterior experiments concerning the removal of zinc from water white beans that had washed and dried at 30 c during 24 h were used 2 2 sorption experiments batch sorption studies were performed in an incubator at 22 c with agitation at 150 rpm and in the absence of light using a known mass of zn ii in 50 ml of ultrapure water in 100 ml erlenmeyer flasks the zn ii solutions used had final concentrations of 0 1 mg l 1 or 0 5 mg l 1 and were freshly prepared on a daily basis from a stock solution of zn no3 2 6h2o 1000 mg l 1 in 1 of nitric acid 65 suprapure such concentrations were selected to represent a high level 100 μg l 1 and a very high level 500 μg l 1 of zinc found in rainwater the masses of biosorbent used to perform the experiments were 0 5 g 1 bean 2 6 g 5 beans and 5 3 g 10 beans corresponding to a bean mass to volume ratio m v of 10 g l 1 52 g l 1 and 106 g l 1 respectively since the ph value of water directly affects metal solubility and the dissociation degree of functional groups located on the surface of biosorbent the effect of ph on the removal of zn ii from water by the white beans was evaluated for three initial ph values 4 0 acid ph value for atmospheric waters 5 6 neutral ph for atmospheric waters and 7 0 basic ph value for atmospheric waters seinfeld and pandis 1998 the ph of solutions was adjusted with nitric acid and sodium hydrogencarbonate solutions experiments started when a known mass of white beans was added to a solution of known concentration of zn ii at a defined ph and inserted in the incubator the experiments were stopped at specific times of 0 5 h 1 h 1 5 h 2 h 4 h 6 h and 24 h for such aliquots of 20 ml of solution were collected for each period of interaction time and then 20 μl of nitric acid 65 were added suprapure to obtain ph 2 for posterior analysis of the zn ii concentration by atomic absorption spectroscopy the initial concentration of zn ii solution at 0 h was also determined for each of the periods of interaction time an independent flask was used and at least three replicates were made the normalized average concentrations of zn ii ct c0 obtained for different ph values masses of biosorbent and initial zn ii concentrations were compared using one sided student s t test at 5 significance level the controls were performed with ultrapure water and beans in a similar way to the remaining experiments to evaluate the chemical morphological and structural features of white beans along the sorption process bean samples of each sampling time were saved and dried at 30 c for posterior analysis using ftir atr sem edx and xrd for sem analyses images of the bean shells and bean cores before and after 1 4 and 6 h were acquired resorting to experiments using a zinc aqueous solution of 10 mg l 1 in order to amplify the sorption behavior of zinc on the beans as no changes were observed with the lower concentration of 500 μg l 1 sorption experiments were also performed with five real rainwater samples nevertheless due to the volume of samples available the experiments were only performed once for each sample moreover the experiments were performed at rainwater s natural ph ph 5 1 for sample 1 ph 5 8 for sample 2 ph 6 4 for sample 3 ph 6 1 for sample 4 and ph 5 5 for sample 5 for the bean mass of 2 6 g 5 beans only and were stopped at 0 5 h 1 h 2 h 4 h and 6 h the rainwater samples were spiked with 100 μg l 1 samples 1 2 3 4 and 5 and or 500 μg l 1 samples 1 2 and 4 of zn ii according to the volume of the sample available for analysis the concentration of zn ii in the rainwater samples before and after the period of interaction time with the white beans was also measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy regarding the rainwater samples they were collected in the city of estarreja portugal in may 2016 between 4th and 10th of may the sample collection was carried out at 70 cm above ground through glass funnels with a 30 cm diameter into 5 l glass bottles these containers were left out open to collect the bulk deposition both wet and dry depositions during approximately 24 h santos et al 2014 after collection the samples were transported to the laboratory and were immediately filtered through mixed cellulose esters filters millipore of 0 45 μm pore size and were refrigerated at 4 c until analysis prior to use all glass material was immersed in a solution of naoh 0 1 m for 30 min then rinsed with distilled water followed by further immersion in a solution of hno3 4 m for 24 h and then rinsed first with distilled water and finally with ultrapure water 2 3 analytical methods uv vis spectra in the range of 200 500 nm were recorded on a shimadzu dusseldorf germany model uv 210 pc spectrophotometer using quartz cells of 1 cm path lengths ultrapure water was used as reference in order to obtain the baseline atomic absorption spectroscopy analysis was carried out using a perkinelmer aanalyst 100 atomic absorption spectrometer air acetylene flame operated at the 213 9 nm zn analytical line using a zinc hallow cathode lamp ftir atr analyses were performed on a perkinelmer usa spectrum bx ftir instrument the samples were analyzed within the 4000 550 cm 1 range at a 4 cm 1 resolution and sixty four scans were averaged for the background spectrum air was used sem analyses were carried out using a scanning electron microscope hitachi su 70 operating at an accelerating voltage of 15 kv edx examinations were performed using an edx bruker xrd data were collected using a pan analytical empyrean x ray diffractometer equipped with cu ka monochromatic radiation source at 45 kv 40 ma 2 4 evaluation of sorption and kinetic models the amount of zn ii sorbed by white beans at a given time t q t mg g 1 was inferred using the mass balance between the initial concentration of zn ii in solutions c 0 mg l 1 and the concentration remaining after the time of contact t c t mg l 1 with the biosorbent as follows 1 q t c 0 c t v m where v l is the volume of the solution and m g is the mass of dried white beans for most cases with the zn ii removal c t seems to decrease while q t values increase until equilibrium values q e are achieved the results were also compared using the removal percentage for each contact time t r t 2 r t c 0 c t c 0 100 experimental data were fitted to pseudo first order eq 3 and pseudo second order eq 4 kinetic models through the following equations tran et al 2017 3 q t q e 1 e k 1 t 4 q t q e 2 k 2 t 1 q e k 2 t where k 1 h 1 and k 2 g mg 1 h 1 are the pseudo first order and the pseudo second order rate constants respectively furthermore q e mg g and q t mg g are the amount of solute sorbed per gram of sorbent at equilibrium and at any t h respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of the initial concentration of zn ii the initial ph and the amount of beans on the sorption process fig 1 shows the variation of the normalized concentration c t c 0 of zn ii in water with time t h after contact with 1 5 and 10 beans for the initial zn ii concentrations of 100 μg l 1 and 500 μg l 1 and for the initial ph values of 4 0 5 6 and 7 0 as shown in fig 1 when using 1 and 5 beans per solution and for both initial concentrations the normalized concentration of zn ii tends to decrease with time suggesting an uptake of this metal by the beans however when 5 beans were used for the initial concentration of 100 μg l 1 at a ph value of 7 0 and with a contact time of 6 h a clear increase of zn ii concentration in the solution p 0 001 was observed which was also slightly observed for the initial zn ii concentration of 500 μg l 1 p 0 04 this suggests that the zn ii previously sorbed by the beans was released back into the solution nevertheless at 24 h the concentration of zn ii in the solution decreased again suggesting that the sorption process restarted for the experiments of 1 and 5 beans and up to an hour and a half a slower sorption capacity for water at ph 4 0 than at ph 7 0 p 0 05 was observed suggesting that at the initial times the ph of the water affects the sorption capacity when 10 beans were used and for the initial concentrations of 100 μg l 1 and of 500 μg l 1 the normalized concentration of zn ii decreased with time up to 2 h however the concentration of zn ii in solution increased after 2 h for all ph values and for both initial concentrations and was more pronounced for the initial concentration of 100 μg l 1 while for the concentration of 500 μg l 1 the increase was less pronounced tending to stabilize moreover at ph 7 0 the normalized concentration of zn ii at 2 h was statistically lower than at 4 h p 0 05 for both the initial tested concentrations 100 μg l 1 and 500 μg l 1 the increase of zn ii concentration in the solution indicated that part of the zn ii sorbed by beans was then released back into the solution and this effect seems to have increased with the increasing ph values table 1 presents the removal of zn ii rt the residual concentration of zn ii czn ii mg l 1 and the calculated amount of zn ii sorbed per gram of bean qt mg g 1 for different contact times under the tested conditions two initial concentrations 100 μg l 1 and 500 μg l 1 three initial ph values 4 0 5 6 and 7 0 three amounts of beans 1 5 and 10 beans which complements fig 1 thus as can be surmised from table 1 and fig 1 results suggest that an increase of the amount of beans increases the speed of the removal of zn ii from the solution this can be observed for the contact time of 2 h considering that up to this time there is no release of zn ii into the solution and depending on the ph used 1 bean removed between about 31 and 40 for an initial concentration of 100 μg l 1 and 26 and 35 for an initial concentration of 500 μg l 1 using 5 beans between about 62 and 68 for an initial concentration of 100 μg l 1 and 71 and 73 for an initial concentration of 500 μg l 1 using 10 beans between about 65 and 83 for an initial concentration of 100 μg l 1 and 79 and 89 for an initial concentration of 500 μg l 1 on the other hand the increase of the amount of beans accelerated the release of the zn ii from the beans back into the solution highlighted in the case of 5 beans with a contact time of 6 h and in the case of 10 beans with contact times of 2 h and 4 h for the initial concentrations of 100 μg l 1 and 500 μg l 1 respectively thus overall these results suggest that for 2 h of contact time higher removal percentages were attained using larger amounts of beans on the other hand using a smaller number of beans more contact time was needed for the removal of a higher quantity of zn ii high percentages of zn ii removal were attained for 1 and 5 beans with no or a small release of zn ii from the beans into the solution respectively therefore for 1 bean higher percentages of zn ii removal were obtained for a contact time of 24 h and were higher than 83 and 92 for the initial concentrations of 100 μg l 1 and 500 μg l 1 respectively for 5 beans higher percentages of zn ii removal were also obtained for a contact time of 24 h and were higher than 71 and 86 for the initial concentrations of 100 μg l 1 and 500 μg l 1 respectively these results are in line with other findings which have showed the uptake of zinc by phaseolus vulgaris when irrigated with metal polluted waters e g tom et al 2014 or during phytoremediation of metal contaminated soil e g poniedziałek et al 2010 corroborating the tendency of this specie to retain zinc 3 2 kinetic modelling of results the amount of zn ii sorbed by 1 and 5 white beans at a time t q t mg g 1 versus the time and the fittings of the experimental data to pseudo first and pseudo second order kinetic models are presented in fig 2 since for 10 beans the fitting of the experimental data to the kinetic models was not as satisfactory as that observed for 1 and 5 beans these are presented in the sm fig sm 2 in addition the fitting parameters obtained for the three quantities of white beans used are also summarized in the sm table sm 1 results from the kinetic data obtained for 1 and 5 beans showed to be satisfactory considering the values of r square r2 which ranged between 0 853 and 0 998 for the pseudo first order model and between 0 826 and 0 995 for the pseudo second order model however as the values of the residual sum of squares rss were between 0 036 and 4 712 for the pseudo first order model and between 0 075 and 19 296 for the pseudo second order model the results indicate that the pseudo first order model presents a better adjustment to the experimental data moreover the results also showed to be kinetically adequate for the removal of zn ii from water either using 1 bean or 5 beans as well as for both initial concentrations tested 3 3 characterization of the bean in the sorption process fig 3 shows the sem images of the bean shells and bean cores before and after 1 4 and 6 h in a zinc aqueous solution of 10 mg l 1 as shown in fig 3 the bean shells and bean cores presented different morphological traits and levels of organization before contact with the zn ii solution the bean shells showed a continuous structure with an irregular porosity and high interconnectivity while the cores showed an irregular structure with protuberances although after 6 h of contact with the aqueous solution of zinc morphological alterations on the bean shells were not observed some alterations were noticeable on the bean cores the sem images of the bean cores after 6 h of contact with the aqueous solution of zinc highlight the swelling of protuberances on the core possibly due to the occurrence of the absorption of water table 2 shows the results of the edx analyses of the bean shells and cores and results evidenced that both present a very high content of oxygen and contained minor amounts of aluminum iron magnesium potassium and silicon and also minor quantities of calcium for the shells and phosphorus and sulphur for the cores the level of potassium in the core was one order of magnitude higher than in the shells while the levels of aluminium iron and silicon found in the shells were one order of magnitude higher than those found in the cores table 2 in addition xrd analyses of the bean shells and cores see sm fig sm 4 evidenced a broad band from 15 to 35 2θ diffraction angles suggesting the presence of amorphous silica which favors the retention of metals rocha et al 2013 and that may have been involved in the sorption of zinc from the solution fig 4 shows the edx spectra of bean shells after 1 h 4 h and 6 h in a zinc solution the presence of a zn peak in the bean shells after contact with the zinc solution is evident contrary to the results pertaining to either the bean shells before contact with the solution or in the bean cores see sm fig sm 5 thus results indicate that the zn ii in the solution may have been adsorbed in the bean shells which suggests the occurrence of an adsorption process in addition in order to evaluate possible structural changes during the sorption process the ftir atr spectra of bean cores and bean shells were obtained before and after 1 bean was placed in contact during 1 h 2 h 4 h and 6 h with the zn ii solution of 500 μg l 1 see sm fig sm 6 ftir atr spectra show the presence of some similar bands for the cores and shells of the beans during the sorption stuart 2004 and show that no chemical structural changes were observed either on the cores or on the shells of the beans when subject to up to 6 h of contact with the zn ii solution 3 4 evaluation of organic matter release by beans fig 5 shows the uv vis spectra of organic matter released by 1 5 or 10 beans into ultrapure water after 2 h 4 h and 6 h the uv vis spectra after 1 h and 24 h are presented in sm fig sm 3 as shown in fig 6 increasing the contact time of beans with the water results in the appearance of one absorption band located between 250 and 380 nm moreover the band intensity increases with the increasing number mass of beans used thus considering that the removal of zn ii from rainwater by white beans will not result in the introduction of more organic compounds than those already found in the water absorbance values lower than 0 05 a u results suggest that for each 50 ml 1 bean m v of 10 g l 1 up to 6 h or 5 beans m v of 52 g l 1 and 10 beans m v of 106 g l 1 up to 2 h can be used thus it is possible that the release of organic matter from the beans into the water may have acted as a vector for the release of zn ii from the beans back into the solution after 4 h and 2 h of contact time when 5 and 10 beans were used respectively 3 5 removal of zn ii from rainwater samples in order to evaluate the behavior of the zn ii removal process in real rainwater experiments were performed with five different rainwater samples at their natural ph ph 5 1 ph 5 8 ph 6 4 ph 6 1 and ph 5 5 corresponding to samples 1 5 respectively the variations of the normalized concentration of zn ii with the time for the two initial concentrations 100 μg l 1 and 500 μg l 1 and for the sorbent amount of 5 beans are shown in fig 6 the ph values of the samples are near to the neutral ph value for rainwater 5 6 and the ph value of sample 3 6 4 tends towards the basic ph of rainwater seinfeld and pandis 1998 results of the removal of zn ii from the rainwater samples were compared with the results obtained for the removal of zn ii from ultrapure water at a ph value of 5 6 and for the sorbent amount of 5 beans fig 1 overall for both initial concentrations results indicate the same trend up to 4 h that is the concentration of zn ii in solution decreased with time however after 4 h and up to 6 h of contact for both initial concentrations results showed a decrease of concentration of zn ii in the solution except for samples 3 4 and 5 at the initial concentration of 100 μg l 1 where the concentration increased this increase evidenced the release of zn ii from the beans back into the solution which was also slightly noted for the same initial concentration 100 μg l 1 in ultrapure water at ph values of 4 0 and 5 6 and clearly at ph 7 0 fig 1 these findings highlight that after 6 h of contact time between the beans and the sample the release of zn ii from the beans back into the solution is affected by the initial concentration of zn ii however taking into account that 5 beans for the removal of zn ii from rainwater were used and that no more than 2 h of contact time should be used fig 5 the percentages of the removal of zn ii obtained for the initial concentration of 100 μg l 1 were between 58 and 85 while for the experiments in ultrapure water for the ph value of 5 6 fig 1 the percentages of the removal of zn ii were on average about 66 regarding the percentages of the removal of zn ii from rainwater samples for the initial concentration of 500 μg l 1 they were between 65 and 69 after 2 h of contact time while in ultrapure water at the ph value of 5 6 fig 1 they were on average about 72 thus the removal percentages obtained with ultrapure water are in the range and near to values obtained with rainwater samples for the initial concentration of 100 μg l 1 and 500 μg l 1 respectively it should be noted however that the rainwater samples contained other metals and ions data not shown and the results suggest that they did not affect the zinc adsorption by the beans furthermore the concentrations obtained after 2 h were lower than 42 μg l 1 and 175 μg l 1 for the initial concentration of 100 μg l 1 and 500 μg l 1 respectively although the concentrations of zn ii obtained after the removal were higher than the levels recommended for drinking water 5 μg l 1 decree law n º 236 98 they correspond to the removal of more than 58 hence the levels of zn ii obtained in rainwater after the herein described removal process indicate that the treated water is more suitable for use in buildings namely for domestic purposes e g bathing washing clothes and dishes brushing teeth watering the garden washing pets therefore this process works well under real conditions and may constitute a viable alternative towards a more efficient use of water resources 4 conclusions the removal of zn ii from rainwater by the biosorbent white bean phaseolus vulgaris l at environmentally relevant concentrations and conditions was evaluated and results led to the following conclusions a white beans were able to reduce the low zn ii levels 100 and 500 μg l 1 present in water and the removal percentages of zn ii increased with the increase of the initial concentration of the metal in water b the sorption rate of zn ii from the solution increased with increasing sorbent mass 1 5 or 10 beans but for 5 and 10 beans this occurred only up to 4 h and 2 h respectively c the removal of zn ii from water was not affected by its initial ph value only when 1 bean per 50 ml of water was used when 5 and 10 beans per 50 ml of water were used the initial ph of the water affected the removal of zn ii after 4 h and 2 h of contact time with the release of zinc from the beans back into the solution occurring first for the water samples with the basic ph for atmospheric waters d the kinetics of the zn ii white bean system suggested that generally the pseudo first order reaction model was the best prediction for experimental data e sem and ftir atr studies did not present any clear alterations on the morphology and on the chemical structures of the bean shells during the sorption process but sem showed morphologic changes in the cores possibly due to the absorption of water edx analyses revealed that zn ii is retained on the bean shells suggesting that the removal of zn ii from the water is the result of an adsorption process f the release of the organic matter of beans into the water was evaluated by uv vis and the results highlighted that for 1 bean in 50 ml of water the amount of organic matter released by the bean was acceptable up to 6 h of contact time while for 5 and 10 beans the release of organic matter was satisfactory only up to 2 h which in the last cases may have contributed to the release of zn ii from the beans back into the solution observed after 4 h and 2 h respectively g on the whole the results suggest that for the removal of zn ii from rainwater 1 bean per 50 ml of water up to 6 h can be used with an average zn ii removal rate of 63 using 5 and 10 beans per 50 ml of water up to 2 h of contact time the average removal rates of 60 and 65 are obtained respectively the removal of zn ii from rainwater samples by the white beans showed that the matrix of the sample did not interfere with the removal of metal which means that the process can be used in real samples further research is required in order to ascertain and render the process described in this work more sustainable as such it is necessary to investigate whether it is possible to obtain the same results using only the bean shells in the sorption process avoiding waste of the bean cores which may be used for food on the other hand using the entire bean the possibility of removing zinc from rainwater and its posterior use in composting should be explored research should also move towards studying the suitability of beans to remove other potentially toxic elements from rainwater moreover in the future it will be important to disclose how the organic structures of beans contribute to the adsorption of zinc acknowledgments thanks are

18642,the present work aimed to assess the sorption capacity of the common white bean phaseolus vulgaris l to remove zn ii from rainwater rendering it suitable for use in buildings and the efficiency of the process was evaluated for two initial zn ii concentrations representing high 100 μg l 1 and very high 500 μg l 1 levels of zn ii in rainwater the effects of the amount of beans 1 5 and 10 beans per 50 ml as well as the initial ph values of the zinc solution acid 4 neutral 5 6 and basic 7 for atmospheric waters were also assessed the removal of zn from water was affected by the change in ph values when 5 and 10 beans were used after 4 h and 2 h of contact time respectively the accumulated zn ii on the beans was released back into the solution and this release occurred first for the highest tested ph value the sorption rate of zn ii from the solution increased with the increasing amount of beans but for 5 and 10 beans this only took place up to 4 h and 2 h respectively furthermore the removal percentages of zn ii increased with the increase of the initial concentrations of the metal in water kinetic studies revealed that a pseudo first order model provided the best fitting for the experimentally obtained values fourier transform infrared spectroscopy coupled with attenuated total reflectance ftir atr analyses of the bean shells and cores indicated that contact with a zn ii solution did not cause notable alterations to the chemical structures of these bean components scanning electron microscopy sem and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx analyses suggested that the process of sorption occurred at the surface of the beans shells the results obtained in this study also suggest that the matrix of rainwater samples did not interfere with the removal of metal and that the process of the removal of zn ii by the white beans can be applied to real samples on the whole results indicate that for the removal of zn ii from rainwater 1 bean up to 6 h or 5 and 10 beans up to 2 h can be used per 50 ml for the removal of up to 60 of zn ii present in water thus constituting a viable solution for the effective reduction of this metal in rainwater graphical abstract image 1 keywords sorption zinc white bean biosorbent rainwater 1 introduction climate change urban development and higher water consumption rates are commonly acknowledged factors presently putting stress on existing fresh water resources thus the scarcity of fresh water all over the world hoekstra et al 2012 highlights the need to find alternative water resources and the possibility of reusing rainwater as a way to overcome this issue has been suggested in the past angrill et al 2017 in fact various studies have evidenced the potential of harvesting rainwater for domestic purposes simmons et al 2001 busset et al 2011 moreover the rooftops represent an important percentage of impermeable area in urban zones offering a significant possibility for rainwater collection which may be reused in buildings however although rainwater may be considered in the first instance as distilled water several types of chemical contaminants have been found in harvested rainwater such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and pesticides basheer et al 2003 as well as heavy metals santos et al 2008 thus for reusing rainwater in buildings the removal of such contaminants should be performed in order to safeguard human health the european union eu does not have specific legislation or guidelines for the reuse of rainwater in buildings but the legislation for drinking water council directive 98 83 ec can be used as a reference point certainly ensuring the safety of such treated waters from the potentially toxic elements zinc has been recurrently found as a major metal present in rainwater chon et al 2015 omrani et al 2017 furthermore various studies in different parts of the world have showed that rainwater frequently exhibits high levels of zinc e g santos et al 2008 chon et al 2015 omrani et al 2017 some of those much higher than the levels recommended for drinking water namely in portugal according to the portuguese legislation water for human consumption must have a zn ii concentration lower than 5 0 μg l 1 portuguese decree law n º 236 98 however the eu legislation for drinking water council directive 98 83 ec does not specify the recommended maximum level for zinc allowing this parameter to be legislated by each member state as zinc may have toxic effects on human health including fever and gastrointestinal distress world health organization 1996 its presence in rainwater becomes a matter of concern when its intended use is in buildings highlighting that rainwater must undergo treatment for metal removal before its use the removal of contaminants from rainwater requires a methodology that makes use of materials able to retain the contaminants to the best of our knowledge few materials have been tested for the retention of contaminants from rainwater peat cho et al 2014 tecomella leaves brahman et al 2016 fe3o4 mof 235 fe oso3h moradi et al 2016 zeolite na nano fe gan et al 2012 and activated carbon kus et

sorption of aromatic pollutants however only activated carbon was tested for the removal of zinc from rainwater and showed not to be efficient kus et al 2013b biosorption is a biotechnological innovation with the potential for the removal of contaminants from water due to the ability of biomaterials to accumulate contaminants via metabolically independent mediated or physicochemical pathways fomina and gadd 2014 furthermore biomaterials can be non hazardous and readily available from cheap sources various biosorbents have been studied for the removal of contaminants from water such as bacteria including both gram positive and gram negative bacteria as well as cyanobacteria fungi e g mushrooms yeast algae e g micro algae and macro algae industrial wastes e g fermentation and food wastes activated and anaerobic sludges agricultural wastes e g fruit vegetable wastes rice straw wheat bran soybean hulls natural residues e g plant residues sawdust tree barks weeds and other materials e g chitosan cellulose park et al 2010 furthermore some biomaterials such as fungi bacteria and algae were already tested for the removal of zinc from residual coastal and esturine waters e g aftab et al 2013 mameri et al 1999 saiano et al 2005 suzuki et al 2005 however as rainwater is considered a clean water the biomaterial chosen for the removal of contaminants should not introduce additional organic and or inorganic compounds other than those already present the aim of this study was to assess the sorption efficiency of the common white bean phaseolus vulgaris l to remove zn ii from rainwater under realistic conditions and concentrations this biomaterial was chosen because it is cheap and can be easily separated from water after treatment allowing its use as a homemade method for rainwater treatment and subsequent reuse of this type of water in buildings namely for domestic purposes in this study the following effects were evaluated the initial ph of water containing zinc acid neutral and basic ph values for rainwater the sorbent amount three masses the initial concentrations of metal in water two concentrations representing very high and high levels of zinc in rainwater and the contact time between sorbent and water containing zinc some experiments were also performed on real rainwater samples the variation of zinc concentration in the water was evaluated using atomic absorption spectroscopy aas and kinetic sorption studies were carried out chemical structural and morphological features of the white beans tested along the process of sorption were also evaluated using fourier transform infrared ftir atr spectroscopy scanning electron microscopy sem and electron dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx 2 material and methods 2 1 biosorbent preparation the white beans used were phaseolus vulgaris l and were acquired from a large commercial retailer the need to wash the beans prior to their use due to the possibility of releasing organic matter into the water was assessed analyzing the water after different contact periods with the beans 1 h 2 h and 4 h by uv vis washed beans were rinsed with ultrapure water three times and then dried in an oven at 30 c during 2 h 4 h or 24 h in the other hand the unwashed white beans were not subjected to any treatment following their removal from the original packaging then 2 6 g of sorbent equivalent to 5 beans were added to 50 ml of ultrapure water at 100 ml erlenmeyer flasks and inserted in an incubator at 22 c with agitation at 150 rpm and in the absence of light the uv vis results see supplementary material sm fig sm 1 showed that up to 4 h of contact of the beans with the water the washed white beans dried at 30 c during 4 h and 24 h were the most suitable for the purpose of this work for this reason throughout the posterior experiments concerning the removal of zinc from water white beans that had washed and dried at 30 c during 24 h were used 2 2 sorption experiments batch sorption studies were performed in an incubator at 22 c with agitation at 150 rpm and in the absence of light using a known mass of zn ii in 50 ml of ultrapure water in 100 ml erlenmeyer flasks the zn ii solutions used had final concentrations of 0 1 mg l 1 or 0 5 mg l 1 and were freshly prepared on a daily basis from a stock solution of zn no3 2 6h2o 1000 mg l 1 in 1 of nitric acid 65 suprapure such concentrations were selected to represent a high level 100 μg l 1 and a very high level 500 μg l 1 of zinc found in rainwater the masses of biosorbent used to perform the experiments were 0 5 g 1 bean 2 6 g 5 beans and 5 3 g 10 beans corresponding to a bean mass to volume ratio m v of 10 g l 1 52 g l 1 and 106 g l 1 respectively since the ph value of water directly affects metal solubility and the dissociation degree of functional groups located on the surface of biosorbent the effect of ph on the removal of zn ii from water by the white beans was evaluated for three initial ph values 4 0 acid ph value for atmospheric waters 5 6 neutral ph for atmospheric waters and 7 0 basic ph value for atmospheric waters seinfeld and pandis 1998 the ph of solutions was adjusted with nitric acid and sodium hydrogencarbonate solutions experiments started when a known mass of white beans was added to a solution of known concentration of zn ii at a defined ph and inserted in the incubator the experiments were stopped at specific times of 0 5 h 1 h 1 5 h 2 h 4 h 6 h and 24 h for such aliquots of 20 ml of solution were collected for each period of interaction time and then 20 μl of nitric acid 65 were added suprapure to obtain ph 2 for posterior analysis of the zn ii concentration by atomic absorption spectroscopy the initial concentration of zn ii solution at 0 h was also determined for each of the periods of interaction time an independent flask was used and at least three replicates were made the normalized average concentrations of zn ii ct c0 obtained for different ph values masses of biosorbent and initial zn ii concentrations were compared using one sided student s t test at 5 significance level the controls were performed with ultrapure water and beans in a similar way to the remaining experiments to evaluate the chemical morphological and structural features of white beans along the sorption process bean samples of each sampling time were saved and dried at 30 c for posterior analysis using ftir atr sem edx and xrd for sem analyses images of the bean shells and bean cores before and after 1 4 and 6 h were acquired resorting to experiments using a zinc aqueous solution of 10 mg l 1 in order to amplify the sorption behavior of zinc on the beans as no changes were observed with the lower concentration of 500 μg l 1 sorption experiments were also performed with five real rainwater samples nevertheless due to the volume of samples available the experiments were only performed once for each sample moreover the experiments were performed at rainwater s natural ph ph 5 1 for sample 1 ph 5 8 for sample 2 ph 6 4 for sample 3 ph 6 1 for sample 4 and ph 5 5 for sample 5 for the bean mass of 2 6 g 5 beans only and were stopped at 0 5 h 1 h 2 h 4 h and 6 h the rainwater samples were spiked with 100 μg l 1 samples 1 2 3 4 and 5 and or 500 μg l 1 samples 1 2 and 4 of zn ii according to the volume of the sample available for analysis the concentration of zn ii in the rainwater samples before and after the period of interaction time with the white beans was also measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy regarding the rainwater samples they were collected in the city of estarreja portugal in may 2016 between 4th and 10th of may the sample collection was carried out at 70 cm above ground through glass funnels with a 30 cm diameter into 5 l glass bottles these containers were left out open to collect the bulk deposition both wet and dry depositions during approximately 24 h santos et al 2014 after collection the samples were transported to the laboratory and were immediately filtered through mixed cellulose esters filters millipore of 0 45 μm pore size and were refrigerated at 4 c until analysis prior to use all glass material was immersed in a solution of naoh 0 1 m for 30 min then rinsed with distilled water followed by further immersion in a solution of hno3 4 m for 24 h and then rinsed first with distilled water and finally with ultrapure water 2 3 analytical methods uv vis spectra in the range of 200 500 nm were recorded on a shimadzu dusseldorf germany model uv 210 pc spectrophotometer using quartz cells of 1 cm path lengths ultrapure water was used as reference in order to obtain the baseline atomic absorption spectroscopy analysis was carried out using a perkinelmer aanalyst 100 atomic absorption spectrometer air acetylene flame operated at the 213 9 nm zn analytical line using a zinc hallow cathode lamp ftir atr analyses were performed on a perkinelmer usa spectrum bx ftir instrument the samples were analyzed within the 4000 550 cm 1 range at a 4 cm 1 resolution and sixty four scans were averaged for the background spectrum air was used sem analyses were carried out

empyrean x ray diffractometer equipped with cu ka monochromatic radiation source at 45 kv 40 ma 2 4 evaluation of sorption and kinetic models the amount of zn ii sorbed by white beans at a given time t q t mg g 1 was inferred using the mass balance between the initial concentration of zn ii in solutions c 0 mg l 1 and the concentration remaining after the time of contact t c t mg l 1 with the biosorbent as follows 1 q t c 0 c t v m where v l is the volume of the solution and m g is the mass of dried white beans for most cases with the zn ii removal c t seems to decrease while q t values increase until equilibrium values q e are achieved the results were also compared using the removal percentage for each contact time t r t 2 r t c 0 c t c 0 100 experimental data were fitted to pseudo

pseudo first order and the pseudo second order rate constants respectively furthermore q e mg g and q t mg g are the amount of solute sorbed per gram of sorbent at equilibrium and at any t h respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of the initial concentration of zn ii the initial ph and the amount of beans on the sorption process fig 1 shows the variation of the normalized concentration c t c 0 of zn ii in water with time t h after contact with 1 5 and 10 beans for the initial zn ii concentrations of 100 μg l 1 and 500 μg l 1 and for the initial ph values of 4 0 5 6 and 7 0 as shown in fig 1 when using 1 and 5 beans per solution and for both initial concentrations the normalized concentration of zn ii tends to decrease with time suggesting an uptake of this metal by the beans however when 5 beans were used for the initial concentration of 100 μg l 1 at a ph value of 7 0 and with a contact time of 6 h a clear increase of zn ii concentration in the solution p 0 001 was observed which was also slightly observed for the initial zn ii concentration of 500 μg l 1 p 0 04 this suggests that the zn ii previously sorbed by the beans was released back into the solution nevertheless at 24 h the concentration of zn ii in the solution decreased again suggesting that the sorption process restarted for the experiments of 1 and 5 beans and up to an hour and a half a slower sorption capacity for water at ph 4 0 than at ph 7 0 p 0 05 was observed suggesting that at the initial times the ph of the water affects the sorption capacity when 10 beans were used and for the initial concentrations of 100 μg l 1 and of 500 μg l 1 the normalized concentration of zn ii decreased with time up to 2 h however the concentration of zn ii in solution increased after 2 h for all ph values and for both initial concentrations and was more pronounced for the initial concentration of 100 μg l 1 while for the concentration of 500 μg l 1 the increase was less pronounced tending to stabilize moreover at ph 7 0 the normalized concentration of zn ii at 2 h was statistically lower than at 4 h p 0 05 for both the initial tested concentrations 100 μg l 1 and 500 μg l 1 the increase of zn ii concentration in the solution indicated that part of the zn ii sorbed by beans was then released back into the solution and this effect seems to have increased with the increasing ph values table 1 presents the removal of zn ii rt the residual concentration of zn ii czn ii mg l 1 and the calculated amount of zn ii sorbed per gram of bean qt mg g 1 for different contact times under the tested conditions two initial concentrations 100 μg l 1 and 500 μg l 1 three initial ph values 4 0 5 6 and 7 0 three amounts of beans 1 5 and 10 beans which complements fig 1 thus as can be surmised from table 1 and fig 1 results suggest that an increase of the amount of beans increases the speed of the removal of zn ii from the solution this can be observed for the contact time of 2 h considering that up to this time there is no release of zn ii into the solution and depending on the ph used 1 bean removed between about 31 and 40 for an initial concentration of 100 μg l 1 and 26 and 35 for an initial concentration of 500 μg l 1 using 5 beans between about 62 and 68 for an initial concentration of 100 μg l 1 and 71 and 73 for an initial concentration of 500 μg l 1 using 10 beans between about 65 and 83 for an initial concentration of 100 μg l 1 and 79 and 89 for an initial concentration of 500 μg l 1 on the other hand the increase of the amount of beans accelerated the release of the zn ii from the beans back into the solution highlighted in the case of 5 beans with a contact time of 6 h and in the case of 10 beans with contact times of 2 h and 4 h for the initial concentrations of 100 μg l 1 and 500 μg l 1 respectively thus overall these results suggest that for 2 h of contact time higher removal percentages were attained using larger amounts of beans on the other hand using a smaller number of beans more contact time was needed for the removal of a higher quantity of zn ii high percentages of zn ii removal were attained for 1 and 5 beans with no or a small release of zn ii from the beans into the solution respectively therefore for 1 bean higher percentages of zn ii removal were obtained for a contact time of 24 h and were higher than 83 and 92 for the initial concentrations of 100 μg l 1 and 500 μg l 1 respectively for 5 beans higher percentages of zn ii removal were also obtained for a contact time of 24 h and were higher than 71 and 86 for the initial concentrations of 100 μg l 1 and 500 μg l 1 respectively these results are in line with other findings which have showed the uptake of zinc by phaseolus vulgaris when irrigated with metal polluted waters e g tom et al 2014 or during phytoremediation of metal contaminated soil e g poniedziałek et al 2010 corroborating the tendency of this specie to retain zinc 3 2 kinetic modelling of results the amount of zn ii sorbed by 1 and 5 white beans at a time t q t mg g 1 versus the time and the fittings of the experimental data to pseudo first and pseudo second order kinetic models are presented in fig 2 since for 10 beans the fitting of the experimental data to the kinetic models was not as satisfactory as that observed for 1 and 5 beans these are presented in the sm fig sm 2 in addition the fitting parameters obtained for the three quantities of white beans used are also summarized in the sm table sm 1 results from the kinetic data obtained for 1 and 5 beans showed to be satisfactory considering the values of r square r2 which ranged between 0 853 and 0 998 for the pseudo first order model and between 0 826 and 0 995 for the pseudo second order model however as the values of the residual sum of squares rss were between 0 036 and 4 712 for the pseudo first order model and between 0 075 and 19 296 for the pseudo second order model the results indicate that the pseudo first order model presents a better adjustment to the experimental data moreover the results also showed to be kinetically adequate for the removal of zn ii from water either using 1 bean or 5 beans as well as for both initial concentrations tested 3 3 characterization of the bean in the sorption process fig 3 shows the sem images of the bean shells and bean cores before and after 1 4 and 6 h in a zinc aqueous solution of 10 mg l 1 as shown in fig 3 the bean shells and bean cores presented different morphological traits and levels of organization before contact with the zn ii solution the bean shells showed a continuous structure with an irregular porosity and high interconnectivity while the cores showed an irregular structure with protuberances although after 6 h of contact with the aqueous solution of zinc morphological alterations on the bean shells were not observed some alterations were noticeable on the bean cores the sem images of the bean cores after 6 h of contact with the aqueous solution of zinc highlight the swelling of protuberances on the core possibly due to the occurrence of the absorption of water table 2 shows the results of the edx analyses of the bean shells and cores and results evidenced that both present a very high content of oxygen and contained minor amounts of aluminum iron magnesium potassium and silicon and also minor quantities of calcium for the shells and phosphorus and sulphur for the cores the level of potassium in the core was one order of magnitude higher than in the shells while the levels of aluminium iron and silicon found in the shells were one order of magnitude higher than those found in the cores table 2 in addition xrd analyses of the bean shells and cores see sm fig sm 4 evidenced a broad band from 15 to 35 2θ diffraction angles suggesting the presence of amorphous silica which favors the retention of metals rocha et al 2013 and that may have been involved in the sorption of zinc from the solution fig 4 shows the edx spectra of bean shells after 1 h 4 h and 6 h in a zinc solution the presence of a zn peak in the bean shells after contact with the zinc solution is evident contrary to the results pertaining to either the bean shells before contact with the solution or in the bean cores see sm fig sm 5 thus results indicate that the zn ii in the solution may have been adsorbed in the bean shells which suggests the occurrence of an adsorption process in addition in order to evaluate possible structural changes during the sorption process the ftir atr spectra of bean cores and bean shells were obtained before and after 1 bean was placed in contact during 1 h 2 h 4 h and 6 h with the zn ii solution of 500 μg l 1 see sm fig sm 6 ftir atr spectra show the presence of some similar bands for the cores and shells of the beans during the sorption stuart 2004 and show that no chemical structural changes were observed either on the cores or on the shells of the beans when subject to up to 6 h of contact with the zn ii solution 3 4 evaluation of organic matter release by beans fig 5 shows the uv vis spectra of organic matter released by 1 5 or 10 beans into ultrapure water after 2 h 4 h and 6 h the uv vis spectra after 1 h and 24 h are presented in sm fig sm 3 as shown in fig 6 increasing the contact time of beans with the water results in the appearance of one absorption band located between 250 and 380 nm moreover the band intensity increases with the increasing number mass of beans used thus considering that the removal of zn ii from rainwater by white beans will not result in the introduction of more organic compounds than those already found in the water absorbance values lower than 0 05 a u results suggest that for each 50 ml 1 bean m v of 10 g l 1 up to 6 h or 5 beans m v of 52 g l 1 and 10 beans m v of 106 g l 1 up to 2 h can be used thus it is possible that the release of organic matter from the beans into the water may have acted as a vector for the release of zn ii from the beans back into the solution after 4 h and 2 h of contact time when 5 and 10 beans were used respectively 3 5 removal of zn ii from rainwater samples in order to evaluate the behavior of the zn ii removal process in real rainwater experiments were performed with five different rainwater samples at their natural ph ph 5 1 ph 5 8 ph 6 4 ph 6 1 and ph 5 5 corresponding to samples 1 5 respectively the variations of the normalized concentration of zn ii with the time for the two initial concentrations 100 μg l 1 and 500 μg l 1 and for the sorbent amount of 5 beans are shown in fig 6 the ph values of the samples are near to the neutral ph value for rainwater 5 6 and the ph value of sample 3 6 4 tends towards the basic ph of rainwater seinfeld and pandis 1998 results of the removal of zn ii from the rainwater samples were compared with the results obtained for the removal of zn ii from ultrapure water at a ph value of 5 6 and for the sorbent amount of 5 beans fig 1 overall for both initial concentrations results indicate the same trend up to 4 h that is the concentration of zn ii in solution decreased with time however after 4 h and up to 6 h of contact for both initial concentrations results showed a decrease of concentration of zn ii in the solution except for samples 3 4 and 5 at the initial concentration of 100 μg l 1 where the concentration increased this increase evidenced the release of zn ii from the beans back into the solution which was also slightly noted for the same initial concentration 100 μg l 1 in ultrapure water at ph values of 4 0 and 5 6 and clearly at ph 7 0 fig 1 these findings highlight that after 6 h of contact time between the beans and the sample the release of zn ii from the beans back into the solution is affected by the initial concentration of zn ii however taking into account that 5 beans for the removal of zn ii from rainwater were used and that no more than 2 h of contact time should be used fig 5 the percentages of the removal of zn ii obtained for the initial concentration of 100 μg l 1 were between 58 and 85 while for the experiments in ultrapure water for the ph value of 5 6 fig 1 the percentages of the removal of zn ii were on average about 66 regarding the percentages of the removal of zn ii from rainwater samples for the initial concentration of 500 μg l 1 they were between 65 and 69 after 2 h of contact time while in ultrapure water at the ph value of 5 6 fig 1 they were on average about 72 thus the removal percentages obtained with ultrapure water are in the range and near to values obtained with rainwater samples for the initial concentration of 100 μg l 1 and 500 μg l 1 respectively it should be noted however that the rainwater samples contained other metals and ions data not shown and the results suggest that they did not affect the zinc adsorption by the beans furthermore the concentrations obtained after 2 h were lower than 42 μg l 1 and 175 μg l 1 for the initial concentration of 100 μg l 1 and 500 μg l 1 respectively although the concentrations of zn ii obtained after the removal were higher than the levels recommended for drinking water 5 μg l 1 decree law n º 236 98 they correspond to the removal of more than 58 hence the levels of zn ii obtained in rainwater after the herein described removal process indicate that the treated water is more suitable for use in buildings namely for domestic purposes e g bathing washing clothes and dishes brushing teeth watering the garden washing pets therefore this process works well under real conditions and may constitute a viable alternative towards a more efficient use of water resources 4 conclusions the removal of zn ii from rainwater by the biosorbent white bean phaseolus vulgaris l at environmentally relevant concentrations and conditions was evaluated and results led to the following conclusions a white beans were able to reduce the low zn ii levels 100 and 500 μg l 1 present in water and the removal percentages of zn ii increased with the increase of the initial concentration of the metal in water b the sorption rate of zn ii from the solution increased with increasing sorbent mass 1 5 or 10 beans but for 5 and 10 beans this occurred only up to 4 h and 2 h respectively c the removal of zn ii from water was not affected by its initial ph value only when 1 bean per 50 ml of water was used when 5 and 10 beans per 50 ml of water were used the initial ph of the water affected the removal of zn ii after 4 h and 2 h of contact time with the release of zinc from the beans back into the solution occurring first for the water samples with the basic ph for atmospheric waters d the kinetics of the zn ii white bean system suggested that generally the pseudo first order reaction model was the best prediction for experimental data e sem and ftir atr studies did not present any clear alterations on the morphology and on the chemical structures of the bean shells during the sorption process but sem showed morphologic changes in the cores possibly due to the absorption of water edx analyses revealed that zn ii is retained on the bean shells suggesting that the removal of zn ii from the water is the result of an adsorption process f the release of the organic matter of beans into the water was evaluated by uv vis and the results highlighted that for 1 bean in 50 ml of water the amount of organic matter released by the bean was acceptable up to 6 h of contact time while for 5 and 10 beans the release of organic matter was satisfactory only up to 2 h which in the last cases may have contributed to the release of zn ii from the beans back into the solution observed after 4 h and 2 h respectively g on the whole the results suggest that for the removal of zn ii from rainwater 1 bean per 50 ml of water up to 6 h can be used with an average zn ii removal rate of 63 using 5 and 10 beans per 50 ml of water up to 2 h of contact time the average removal rates of 60 and 65 are obtained respectively the removal of zn ii from rainwater samples by the white beans showed that the matrix of the sample did not interfere with the removal of metal which means that the process can be used in real samples further research is required in order to ascertain and render the process described in this work more sustainable as such it is necessary to investigate whether it is possible to obtain the same results using only the bean shells in the sorption process avoiding waste of the bean cores which may be used for food on the other hand using the entire bean the possibility of removing zinc from rainwater and its posterior use in composting should be explored research should also move towards studying the suitability of beans to remove other potentially toxic elements from rainwater moreover in the future it will be important to disclose how the organic structures of beans contribute to the adsorption of zinc acknowledgments thanks are

18643,2 methylisoborneol 2 mib is one of the most common taste and odor t o compounds in waterbodies and causes complaints from drinking water consumers this is a case study of two water treatment plants taking the raw water from lake tai the third largest lake in china the relationships between the 2 mib concentration and algae density light change and nutrients of the raw water for the most recent four years were comprehensively investigated the yearly variation pattern of the 2 mib concentration in the raw water is closely related to the algae cell density both values reached peaks in july or august with concentrations as high as 500 ng l and 1000 104 count l respectively for the diurnal 2 mib variation the concentrations increase from 5 to 6 am reach a peak value at 12 p m and then gradually decrease and achieve the lowest value at night these results further confirm that 2 mib is highly related to algae cell activity e g photosynthesis in addition 2 mib exists both inside and outside algae cells i e intracellular and extracellular or bound and dissolved 2 mib respectively and the percentage of the extracellular dissolved portion was as high as 60 during the study period conventional water treatment processes usually referrings to coagulation sedimentation and sand filtration csf in wtps have extremely unstable 2 mib removal efficiencies from 20 to 95 which is mainly related to the existing forms of 2 mib the intracellular bound portion can be effectively removed by csf especially sand filtration while advanced water treatment processes are required to remove the dissolved 2 mib an ozone activated carbon process is recommended and the 2 mib removal rate can reach 100 this research has great theoretical and engineering value for treating water containing t o compounds graphical abstract image 1 keywords 2 methylisoborneol 2 mib taste and odor t o causing compounds extracellular dissolved 2 mib intracellular bound 2 mib drinking water treatment plants 1 introduction the taste and odor t o problem in drinking water is a major global concern t o causing compounds frequently appear in waterbodies and result in strong odors at extremely low concentrations some common microbes and even algae in pipelines may produce t o causing compounds which greatly decrease the quality of potable water zhou et al 2017 2 methylisoborneol 2 mib has been identified as a representative t o causing compound in drinking water sources 2 mib causes earthy and musty odors in water leading to complaints from consumers and the use of alternative drinking water supplies such as bottled water mcguire 1995 watson et al 2000 the presence of 2 mib is closely related to the algae activity in waterbodies 2 mib is mainly produced by the metabolism and biodegradation of cyanobacteria which usually bloom in the presence of nutrients at warmer temperatures srinivasan and sorial 2011 watson et al 2008 many species of cyanobacteria are confirmed as 2 mib producers such as pseudanabaena sp oscillatoria sp and planktothrix sp su et al 2015 2 mib exists both inside and outside algae cells and is generally categorized as intracellular and extracellular i e bound and dissolved portions previous studies reported that the performance of water treatment processes could be influenced by the intracellular to extracellular ratio of t o compounds the removal rate of extracellular geosmin and 2 mib by conventional water treatment and disinfection treatment processes was found to be less than 20 jung et al 2004b persson et al 2007 srinivasan and sorial 2011 zamyadi et al 2015 while their removal within the intact cells as intracellular compounds was highly effective cell damage during water treatment processes and the release of intracellular t o compounds add to the difficulty of t o compounds effective removal by water treatment processes peterson et al 1995 schmidt et al 2009 zamyadi et al 2015 2 mib odors can be directly detected by the human nose at very low concentrations 6 3 15 0 ng l 1 watson 2004 young et al 1996 finding effective water treatment processes that can remove 2 mib to below the odor threshold concentration otc has become a significant issue for water authorities studies have shown that 2 mib cannot be easily removed by conventional water treatments usually refers to coagulation sedimentation and sand filtration csf or typical chemical oxidation including permanganate or chlorine bruchet and duguet 2004 kim et al 1997 watson 2004 hence advanced water treatment processes such as ozonation activated carbon adsorption membrane filtration or combined processes are required for effective removal ozonation is a very effective process to remove odorants from source water and has been employed for the removal of 2 mib due to its strong oxidation potential generally more natural organic matter nom exists in water than 2 mib nom reacts more quickly with ozone than the 2 mib does in water so the ozone is often quickly consumed thus a high ozone dosage is needed for effective 2 mib removal our recent study li et al 2018 explored the kinetics and mechanism of pseudanabaena cells inactivation 2 mib release and degradation under exposure of ozone chlorine and permanganate ozone is capable to inactivate the cell and degrade 2 mib the released 2 mib was found to be substantially oxidized when the initial o3 concentration is above 1 mg l by our previous study a previous study chen et al 2013 reported that the 2 mib concentration in treated water could be reduced below 10 ng l by a combination of an ozonation biological activated carbon process o3 gac and increased ozone dosage numerous studies have investigated using activated carbon adsorption using either granular activated carbon gac or powdered activated carbon pac for water treatment to remove seasonal t o cook et al 2001 ho and newcombe 2005 jung et al 2004a pirbazari et al 1993 and 10 15 mg l pac chen et al 2013 results in a good 2 mib removal rate 42 40 82 54 currently pac is the water treatment technology most commonly used to remove seasonal t o compounds in waterbodies and the pac dosage can be adjusted based on the influent odorant concentration srinivasan and sorial 2011 gac is usually used in filtration beds in water treatment plants wtps ridal et al 2001 investigated the long term performance of gac filter beds in a wtp in canada and determined that the 2 mib concentration in the treated water was below the otc during the 2 month study however the t o removal rate dramatically decreased due to nom in waterbodies competing for gac adsorption sites the adsorption effectiveness of activated carbon can be affected by the adsorbent properties such as the pore size distribution and surface characteristics previous studies newcombe et al 2002a 2002b pirbazari et al 1993 have reported that a 3 10 mg l nom concentration can lower the 2 mib adsorption capacity of activated carbon previous studies about 2 mib removal were mainly conducted on a laboratory scale cook et al 2001 jung et al 2004b mizuno et al 2011 zoschke et al 2012 and the 2 mib removal for practical application in full scale wtps has not been studied extensively zamyadi et al 2015 reported that the performance of the studied treatment processes for total 2 mib gsm removal is ranked filtration clarification pac and gac adsorption and or biological degradation pac conventional filtration coagulation clarification chlorination for extracellular 2 mib gsm removal however the ozonation process which is a common and important advanced process in wtps was not included in their study for t o removal guo et al 2016 found that musty odors could be removed efficiently through a combination of ozonation and the bac process while septic odors required further treatment with sand filtration and chlorination in a full scale water treatment plant whereas the dissolved bound 2 mib was totally ignored and the sand filtration process for 2 mib removal was not studied in their work in our study the correlation of the 2 mib concentration in the raw water with the algae and cyanobacteria nutrients and light levels was systematically studied and the 2 mib removal by different treatment units in full scale wtps was analyzed systematic research on the 2 mib variation pattern in water source and removal properties under different wtp treatment units was firstly reported in this study the major objectives of this study were 1 to understand the relationship between the 2 mib concentration and algae cell activity 2 to explore the effects of the csf and o3 gac processes on the removal of dissolved bound 2 mib 3 and to offer practical suggestions on a suitable water treatment process for 2 mib removal 2 materials and methods some data were measured by the authors while other data were directly collected from the wtps therefore some detailed information e g the brand of the facility or material is not supplied 2 1 measurement of 2 mib the total 2 mib concentration was measured by gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms after using solid phase microextraction spme to extract samples based on reports by lin et al 2002 2003 although the actual brand of the facility was not always the same between different wtps and sampling times to measure the extracellular 2 mib concentration samples were first filtered through a 0 45 μm ptfe membrane filter to remove algae cells and other suspended materials and then the filtrates were collected for measurement the difference between the total and extracellular 2 mib concentrations was used as the intracellular 2 mib concentration li et al 2018 2 2 data measurement lugol s iodine solution 2 final con was added to the water samples allowing them to be preserved and counted on a later date the cell density was measured by direct cell counting parsons 1980 using a sedgwick rafter counting chamber and microscope with a magnification of 40 the phytoplankton species composition was identified according to hu et al 1980 more than 60 algae species were observed in the water samples the diatom was the typical algae species during the spring and winter seasons while cyanobacteria became dominant during the summer and autumn seasons the most typical species observed were microcystis anabaena cyclotella and pseudanabaena 2 mib producing cyanobacteria such as oscillatoria and planktothrix were also frequently observed during the summer season the total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp were determined using a combined persulfate digestion ebina et al 1983 followed by spectrophotometric analysis the light illuminance was measured by an illuminance meter smart sensor china 2 3 study area and sampling the area selected for this study was lake tai which is a typical shallow lake situated at the south of the yangtze river delta in eastern china paerl et al 2011 wilhelm et al 2011 lake tai is the third largest freshwater lake in china with an area of 2445 km2 its average depth is 1 9 m and the annual average temperature is approximately 17 1 c in recent years widespread and frequent algal blooms on lake tai due to rapid industrialization and urbanization in the area have seriously degraded the water quality significant increases in nutrient loading accelerate eutrophication which is characterized by toxic and odor producing cyanobacterial blooms during the summer months chen et al 2003 2009 water sampling and measurements were performed several times a month evenly between 2013 and 2017 samples were taken from the raw water and effluents from every full scale treatment process within 2 major wtps a and b which are both located in jiangsu province of china and take their source water directly from lake tai with the water intake depth of 3 4 m detailed information about the water treatment processes of these 2 wtps is shown in table 1 the sampling points for wtps a and b are as follows 1 raw water 2 pre ozonation 3 sedimentation 4 sand filtration 5 post ozonation 6 gac and 7 finished water the specific retention time of each treatment unit was considered during the sampling so that the samples would be taken from as similar batches of water as possible all sampling taps were fully rinsed before sampling the samples were placed on ice to maintain a low temperature environment and transported to the laboratories for immediate analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 2 mib sources and influencing factors 3 1 1 relationship between 2 mib occurrence and algae activity 2 mib is highly related with the metabolism of cyanobacteria pseudoanabaena a common cyanobacterial genus can produce 2 mib and partly release it from cells into water especially after the cell s death izaguirre and taylor 1998 li et al 2019 in this study variations in the algae density and 2 mib concentration in the lake tai source water were continuously monitored from 2013 to 2017 the results in fig 1 show that the maximum 2 mib concentration in the wtp a raw water was approximately 150 550 ng l which occurred during the summer months it can be easily seen from the figure that when the algae density reached a peak value the 2 mib concentration also showed a correspondingly high level the peak values of the 2 mib concentration and algae density in the raw water occurred at the same times thus it can be concluded that the presence of 2 mib is significantly related to algae growth in the raw water however the algae density during the peak time in 2016 was higher than that observed in 2015 while the 2 mib concentration during the peak time in 2016 was much lower than that observed in 2015 these results may be that the algae species composition changed during the 2 years our study also found that the algae density of the 2 mib producer pseudanabaena decreased in 2016 in the raw water of wtp a according to the detected data of our research the average pseudanabaena algae density from july to september in the wtp a raw water was 3 104 13 104 and 5 104 cells l respectively from 2014 to 2016 2 mib producing algae may make up a smaller proportion of the algae species in 2016 than that in 2015 explaining the higher algae density and lower 2 mib concentration during the peak time in 2016 our findings were in accordance with a previous study in which the odorous compound oc concentrations are highly dependent on the oc producing cell density oh et al 2017 su et al 2015 reported that high 2 mib concentrations were found only in water with a high cell density of planktothrix which has been identified as a 2 mib producer therefore better control of the 2 mib at drinking water plants can be achieved by preventing the growth of 2 mib producing cyanobacteria however the study also showed that a high cell density of planktothrix did not necessarily result in a high 2 mib concentration because 2 mib production is not simply associated with the 2 mib producing cyanobacteria density and is also affected by other factors such as the light intensity and water temperature 3 1 2 effect of nutrients on the 2 mib concentration nutrients such as nitrogen n and phosphorus p have a significant influence on algae growth different types of algae cells have different elemental compositions ho et al 2003 hodgkiss and lu 2004 additionally the n and p demands of different algae species are not the same when the growth of some algae is inhibited due to a shortage of a specific nutrient other algae species that require less of the nutrient can rapidly grow and become dominant in waterbodies as shown in fig 2 the 2 mib concentration in the wtp b raw water increased remarkably in 2016 in the same period the tp concentration and algae density increased while the tn concentration decreased generally an optimal nitrogen to phosphorus stoichiometry for algae growth exists n p atomic ratio 16 klausmeier et al 2004 redfield 1958 in our study the results show that the average nitrogen to phosphorus atomic stoichiometry was approximately 30 1 in the wtp b raw water thus the low p concentration may be the factor limiting the algae growth in the raw water explaining the algae density increased with an increase in the tp concentration in the waterbody according to fig 2a and c the tp concentration increased significantly in 2016 and the 2 mib concentration also increased at the same times moreover our study detected that the algae density of pseudanabaena which is a confirmed 2 mib producer increased significantly in 2016 in the raw water of wtp b therefore the 2 mib concentrations tend to increase in a high phosphorus waterbody ryota hino et al ryota et al 2017 also reported that 2 mib tended to increase when tp concentration exceeded 0 02 mg l and the control of nutrients concentrations in the waterbody was one of the important strategies for solving t o problems of drinking water which was in accordance with our conclusion as shown in fig 3 when the 2 mib concentration exceeded 150 ng l the n p ratios were all below 29 1 the 2 mib concentration was generally low when the n p ratios were high in the waterbody smith 1983 collected data from 17 lakes worldwide and concluded that when tn tp 29 1 by mass cyanobacteria tend to dominate in contrast when tn tp 29 1 by mass cyanobacteria are less dominant the results of their studies were consistent with those of our findings since 2 mib is mainly produced by the metabolism and biodegradation of some cyanobacteria srinivasan and sorial 2011 3 1 3 effect of light on the 2 mib concentration the light intensity is one of the major factors that affects the growth of 2 mib producing cyanobacteria the effect of variations in the light on the 2 mib concentration in the raw water was investigated in this study fig 4 shows the diurnal variation of the 2 mib concentration in the raw water from lake tai the 2 mib concentration during the day was obviously much higher than that at night by a factor of approximately 2 5 this phenomenon may be because the metabolic activity of 2 mib producing cyanobacteria increases and more 2 mib is produced during the day than at night some cyanobacteria may float to the surface during the day and move down to the bottom at night resulting in higher 2 mib concentration was detected in the water surface during the day it also might be one of the reasons to cause the 2 mib concentration change given that the diurnal temperature differences in the waterbody are not large the main cause of the 2 mib concentration variation may be the differences in light throughout the day the diurnal illuminance variation is also shown in fig 4 and it shows a great correlation with the changes of the total 2 mib concentration hence the 2 mib concentration appears to be correlated with the light and metabolic activity of 2 mib producing cyanobacteria 3 2 2 mib removal by different treatment units 3 2 1 relationship between the percentage of dissolved 2 mib and the total concentration of 2 mib 2 mib exists in both dissolved and bound forms fig 5 shows the dissolved and bound 2 mib concentrations in the raw water from lake tai in a period of 2012 the proportions of the two forms of 2 mib greatly varied with the location and time the percentage of dissolved 2 mib was approximately 40 90 and the average value was approximately 60 fig 6 indicates that a significant negative correlation exists between the percentage of dissolved 2 mib and the total 2 mib concentration i e the bound portion percentage is higher when the total 2 mib concentration is higher the relationship can be approximately described r2 0 7024 as an inverse exponential relationship hydraulic or wind factors causing 2 mib producing cyanobacteriafrom the bottom of the lake they are normally benthic to float may be the reason why the 2 mib concentration increased and more bound or intracellular 2 mib was measured in the raw water due to the flotation of benthic cyanobacteria cells 3 2 2 2 mib removal efficiency of different water treatment units fig 7 illustrates the variation in the 2 mib removal rate from the raw water under a series of water treatment units in wtp a and wtp b including pre ozonation csf and o3 gac as shown the water samples were collected after pre ozonation sedimentation sand filtration post ozonation and gac pre ozonation is not effective for 2 mib removal which may be related to the low ozone dosage approximately 0 5 1 0 mg l in the wtp our previous study li et al 2018 indicated that no obvious variation in either the total or extracellular 2 mib concentration was observed under the 0 2 mg l o3 dosage because many coexisting organic compounds rapidly depleted the ozone also our previous study li et al 2018 reported that cells were damaged and intracellular organic compounds were released with a higher o3 dosage for the effective treatment of odor producing algae contained water a minimum o3 dosage is required in the ozonation process although intracellular 2 mib could be removed by the sedimentation process together with the removal of cyanobacteria cells the 2 mib removal rate did not significantly increase and even decreased after sedimentation in some cases this outcome may be due to its release from algae sediment as shown in fig 8 the bound 2 mib concentration increased slightly after sedimentation which was in agreement with our assumption zamyadi et al 2012 reported that the sludge bed in the sedimentation tanks was the sink of algal cells and organic compounds the release of intracellular odorants could cause the increase in the musty odor intensity a previous study guo et al 2016 found that the intensities of both the septic and musty odors increased remarkably after the sedimentation process in a full scale water treatment plant this outcome was consistent with our findings subsequently the 2 mib removal efficiency noticeably increased after the sand filtration process as shown in fig 8 nearly no bound 2 mib was detected after the sand filtration indicating that the algae cells were well removed the bound 2 mib was effectively removed along with the removal of algae cells while cell lysis and 2 mib release before backwash also posed an enormous potential risk thus the backwash frequency needs to be well controlled to prevent algae cell accumulation and cell lysis especially during the bloom season fig 9 shows the relationship between the removal rate of 2 mib by csf and the total 2 mib concentration in the raw water sometimes with 10 20 mg l pac before csf as shown the 2 mib removal rate increased with the 2 mib concentration in the raw water i e the 2 mib removal rate by csf was positively correlated with the 2 mib concentration in the raw water in addition to a possibly higher pac dose at higher 2 mib concentrations the previous section section 3 2 1 indicates that a high 2 mib concentration in the raw water corresponds to a high proportion of bound 2 mib as indicated in fig 8 the csf process is effective for the removal of the bound 2 mib therefore the csf process can reasonably effectively remove 2 mib in higher concentrations to achieve a high dissolved 2 mib removal efficiency other pretreatment processes or advanced treatment processes should be used as shown in fig 7 the 2 mib was nearly completely removed after the o3 gac process for conventional water treatment wtps pac and enhanced coagulation filtration are recommended for 2 mib removal the former can effectively adsorb dissolved 2 mib while the latter plays an important role in removing bound 2 mib however csf is extremely unstable for 2 mib removal due to the variations in the 2 mib form present in the raw water as shown in fig 10 while the o3 gac process for 2 mib removal is stable and the removal rate nearly reaches 100 zhang et al 2011 found that the average nom removal rate by gac adsorption is below 20 but gac has a relatively high removal effect for small molecular nom which may be due to the micropore adsorption of activated carbon or the strong hydrophobicity of small molecules generally the t o substances in water are hydrophobic small molecules thus explaining effective adsorption of the 2 mib by gac 4 conclusions the 2 mib concentration in lake tai source water is closely related to the activity of 2 mib producing algae thus the t o problems caused by 2 mib can be better controlled by preventing the growth of 2 mib producing algae the 2 mib concentration appears to be correlated with changes in the nutrients and light in the waterbody high 2 mib concentrations tend to occur at a low n p ratios environment for the diurnal 2 mib variation in waterbodies the concentrations increase from 5 to 6 am reach a peak value at 12 p m and then gradually decrease and achieve the lowest value at night 2 mib exists in both dissolved and bound forms the proportions of the two forms of 2 mib greatly vary with the location and time resulting in extremely unstable 2 mib removal by csf the release of algae sediment results in the decrease of the 2 mib removal rate after sedimentation in some cases the removal of the bound portion of the 2 mib mainly occurs in the sand filtration process and the 2 mib removal efficiency noticeably increased thereafter the total 2 mib removal rate by o3 gac can reach 98 100 for t o problems caused by algae pac and enhanced csf processes are recommended if no advanced processes are available the former can adsorb dissolved 2 mib and the latter can remove bound 2 mib in wtps that apply an ozone activated carbon process the 2 mib and other odorants in treated water can be removed to levels below the otc for a long time additional work is needed to optimize these technologies and achieve larger removal rates with less impact on the effectiveness of the water

18643,2 methylisoborneol 2 mib is one of the most common taste and odor t o compounds in waterbodies and causes complaints from drinking water consumers this is a case study of two water treatment plants taking the raw water from lake tai the third largest lake in china the relationships between the 2 mib concentration and algae density light change and nutrients of the raw water for the most recent four years were comprehensively investigated the yearly variation pattern of the 2 mib concentration in the raw water is closely related to the algae cell density both values reached peaks in july or august with concentrations as high as 500 ng l and 1000 104 count l respectively for the diurnal 2 mib variation the concentrations increase from 5 to 6 am reach a peak value at 12 p m and then gradually decrease and achieve the lowest value at night these results further confirm that 2 mib is highly related to algae cell activity e g photosynthesis in addition 2 mib exists both inside and outside algae cells i e intracellular and extracellular or bound and dissolved 2 mib respectively and the percentage of the extracellular dissolved portion was as high as 60 during the study period conventional water treatment processes usually referrings to coagulation sedimentation and sand filtration csf in wtps have extremely unstable 2 mib removal efficiencies from 20 to 95 which is mainly related to the existing forms of 2 mib the intracellular bound portion can be effectively removed by csf especially sand filtration while advanced water treatment processes are required to remove the dissolved 2 mib an ozone activated carbon process is recommended and the 2 mib removal rate can reach 100 this research has great theoretical and engineering value for treating water containing t o compounds graphical abstract image 1 keywords 2 methylisoborneol 2 mib taste and odor t o causing compounds extracellular dissolved 2 mib intracellular bound 2 mib drinking water treatment plants 1 introduction the taste and odor t o problem in drinking water is a major global concern t o causing compounds frequently appear in waterbodies and result in strong odors at extremely low concentrations some common microbes and even algae in pipelines may produce t o causing compounds which greatly decrease the quality of potable water zhou et al 2017 2 methylisoborneol 2 mib has been identified as a representative t o causing compound in drinking water sources 2 mib causes earthy and musty odors in water leading to complaints from consumers and the use of alternative drinking water supplies such as bottled water mcguire 1995 watson et al 2000 the presence of 2 mib is closely related to the algae activity in waterbodies 2 mib is mainly produced by the metabolism and biodegradation of cyanobacteria which usually bloom in the presence of nutrients at warmer temperatures srinivasan and sorial 2011 watson et al 2008 many species of cyanobacteria are confirmed as 2 mib producers such as pseudanabaena sp oscillatoria sp and planktothrix sp su et al 2015 2 mib exists both inside and outside algae cells and is generally categorized as intracellular and extracellular i e bound and dissolved portions previous studies reported that the performance of water treatment processes could be influenced by the intracellular to extracellular ratio of t o compounds the removal rate of extracellular geosmin and 2 mib by conventional water treatment and disinfection treatment processes was found to be less than 20 jung et al 2004b persson et al 2007 srinivasan and sorial 2011 zamyadi et al 2015 while their removal within the intact cells as intracellular compounds was highly effective cell damage during water treatment processes and the release of intracellular t o compounds add to the difficulty of t o compounds effective removal by water treatment processes peterson et al 1995 schmidt et al 2009 zamyadi et al 2015 2 mib odors can be directly detected by the human nose at very low concentrations 6 3 15 0 ng l 1 watson 2004 young et al 1996 finding effective water treatment processes that can remove 2 mib to below the odor threshold concentration otc has become a significant issue for water authorities studies have shown that 2 mib cannot be easily removed by conventional water treatments usually refers to coagulation sedimentation and sand filtration csf or typical chemical oxidation including permanganate or chlorine bruchet and duguet 2004 kim et al 1997 watson 2004 hence advanced water treatment processes such as ozonation activated carbon adsorption membrane filtration or combined processes are required for effective removal ozonation is a very effective process to remove odorants from source water and has been employed for the removal of 2 mib due to its strong oxidation potential generally more natural organic matter nom exists in water than 2 mib nom reacts more quickly with ozone than the 2 mib does in water so the ozone is often quickly consumed thus a high ozone dosage is needed for effective 2 mib removal our recent study li et al 2018 explored the kinetics and mechanism of pseudanabaena cells inactivation 2 mib release and degradation under exposure of ozone chlorine and permanganate ozone is capable to inactivate the cell and degrade 2 mib the released 2 mib was found to be substantially oxidized when the initial o3 concentration is above 1 mg l by our previous study a previous study chen et al 2013 reported that the 2 mib concentration in treated water could be reduced below 10 ng l by a combination of an ozonation biological activated carbon process o3 gac and increased ozone dosage numerous studies have investigated using activated carbon adsorption using either granular activated carbon gac or powdered activated carbon pac for water treatment to remove seasonal t o cook et al 2001 ho and newcombe 2005 jung et al 2004a pirbazari et al 1993 and 10 15 mg l pac chen et al 2013 results in a good 2 mib removal rate 42 40 82 54 currently pac is the water treatment technology most commonly used to remove seasonal t o compounds in waterbodies and the pac dosage can be adjusted based on the influent odorant concentration srinivasan and sorial 2011 gac is usually used in filtration beds in water treatment plants wtps ridal et al 2001 investigated the long term performance of gac filter beds in a wtp in canada and determined that the 2 mib concentration in the treated water was below the otc during the 2 month study however the t o removal rate dramatically decreased due to nom in waterbodies competing for gac adsorption sites the adsorption effectiveness of activated carbon can be affected by the adsorbent properties such as the pore size distribution and surface characteristics previous studies newcombe et al 2002a 2002b pirbazari et al 1993 have reported that a 3 10 mg l nom concentration can lower the 2 mib adsorption capacity of activated carbon previous studies about 2 mib removal were mainly conducted on a laboratory scale cook et al 2001 jung et al 2004b mizuno et al 2011 zoschke et al 2012 and the 2 mib removal for practical application in full scale wtps has not been studied extensively zamyadi et al 2015 reported that the performance of the studied treatment processes for total 2 mib gsm removal is ranked filtration clarification pac and gac adsorption and or biological degradation pac conventional filtration coagulation clarification chlorination for extracellular 2 mib gsm removal however the ozonation process which is a common and important advanced process in wtps was not included in their study for t o removal guo et al 2016 found that musty odors could be removed efficiently through a combination of ozonation and the bac process while septic odors required further treatment with sand filtration and chlorination in a full scale water treatment plant whereas the dissolved bound 2 mib was totally ignored and the sand filtration process for 2 mib removal was not studied in their work in our study the correlation of the 2 mib concentration in the raw water with the algae and cyanobacteria nutrients and light levels was systematically studied and the 2 mib removal by different treatment units in full scale wtps was analyzed systematic research on the 2 mib variation pattern in water source and removal properties under different wtp treatment units was firstly reported in this study the major objectives of this study were 1 to understand the relationship between the 2 mib concentration and algae cell activity 2 to explore the effects of the csf and o3 gac processes on the removal of dissolved bound 2 mib 3 and to offer practical suggestions on a suitable water treatment process for 2 mib removal 2 materials and methods some data were measured by the authors while other data were directly collected from the wtps therefore some detailed information e g the brand of the facility or material is not supplied 2 1 measurement of 2 mib the total 2 mib concentration was measured by gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms after using solid phase microextraction spme to extract samples based on reports by lin et al 2002 2003 although the actual brand of the facility was not always the same between different wtps and sampling times to measure the extracellular 2 mib concentration samples were first filtered through a 0 45 μm ptfe membrane filter to remove algae cells and other suspended materials and then the filtrates were collected for measurement the difference between the total and extracellular 2 mib concentrations was used as the intracellular 2 mib concentration li et al 2018 2 2 data measurement lugol s iodine solution 2 final con was added to the water samples allowing them to be preserved and counted on a later date the cell density was measured by direct cell counting parsons 1980 using a sedgwick rafter counting chamber and microscope with a magnification of 40 the phytoplankton species composition was identified according to hu et al 1980 more than 60 algae species were observed in the water samples the diatom was the typical algae species during the spring and winter seasons while cyanobacteria became dominant during the summer and autumn seasons the most typical species observed were microcystis anabaena cyclotella and pseudanabaena 2 mib producing cyanobacteria such as oscillatoria and planktothrix were also frequently observed during the summer season the total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp were determined using a combined persulfate digestion ebina et al 1983 followed by spectrophotometric analysis the light illuminance was measured by an illuminance meter smart sensor china 2 3 study area and sampling the area selected for this study was lake tai which is a typical shallow lake situated at the south of the yangtze river delta in eastern china paerl et al 2011 wilhelm et al 2011 lake tai is the third largest freshwater lake in china with an area of 2445 km2 its average depth is 1 9 m and the annual average temperature is approximately 17 1 c in recent years widespread and frequent algal blooms on lake tai due to rapid industrialization and urbanization in the area have seriously degraded the water quality significant increases in nutrient loading accelerate eutrophication which is characterized by toxic and odor producing cyanobacterial blooms during the summer months chen et al 2003 2009 water sampling and measurements were performed several times a month evenly between 2013 and 2017 samples were taken from the raw water and effluents from every full scale treatment process within 2 major wtps a and b which are both located in jiangsu province of china and take their source water directly from lake tai with the water intake depth of 3 4 m detailed information about the water treatment processes of these 2 wtps is shown in table 1 the sampling points for wtps a and b are as follows 1 raw water 2 pre ozonation 3 sedimentation 4 sand filtration 5 post ozonation 6 gac and 7 finished water the specific retention time of each treatment unit was considered during the sampling so that the samples would be taken from as similar batches of water as possible all sampling taps were fully rinsed before sampling the samples were placed on ice to maintain a low temperature environment and transported to the laboratories for immediate analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 2 mib sources and influencing factors 3 1 1 relationship between 2 mib occurrence and algae activity 2 mib is highly related with the metabolism of cyanobacteria pseudoanabaena a common cyanobacterial genus can produce 2 mib and partly release it from cells into water especially after the cell s death izaguirre and taylor 1998 li et al 2019 in this study variations in the algae density and 2 mib concentration in the lake tai source water were continuously monitored from 2013 to 2017 the results in fig 1 show that the maximum 2 mib concentration in the wtp a raw water was approximately 150 550 ng l which occurred during the summer months it can be easily seen from the figure that when the algae density reached a peak value the 2 mib concentration also showed a correspondingly high level the peak values of the 2 mib concentration and algae density in the raw water occurred at the same times thus it can be concluded that the presence of 2 mib is significantly related to algae growth in the raw water however the algae density during the peak time in 2016 was higher than that observed in 2015 while the 2 mib concentration during the peak time in 2016 was much lower than that observed in 2015 these results may be that the algae species composition changed during the 2 years our study also found that the algae density of the 2 mib producer pseudanabaena decreased in 2016 in the raw water of wtp a according to the detected data of our research the average pseudanabaena algae density from july to september in the wtp a raw water was 3 104 13 104 and 5 104 cells l respectively from 2014 to 2016 2 mib producing algae may make up a smaller proportion of the algae species in 2016 than that in 2015 explaining the higher algae density and lower 2 mib concentration during the peak time in 2016 our findings were in accordance with a previous study in which the odorous compound oc concentrations are highly dependent on the oc producing cell density oh et al 2017 su et al 2015 reported that high 2 mib concentrations were found only in water with a high cell density of planktothrix which has been identified as a 2 mib producer therefore better control of the 2 mib at drinking water plants can be achieved by preventing the growth of 2 mib producing cyanobacteria however the study also showed that a high cell density of planktothrix did not necessarily result in a high 2 mib concentration because 2 mib production is not simply associated with the 2 mib producing cyanobacteria density and is also affected by other factors such as the light intensity and water temperature 3 1 2 effect of nutrients on the 2 mib concentration nutrients such as nitrogen n and phosphorus p have a significant influence on algae growth different types of algae cells have different elemental compositions ho et al 2003 hodgkiss and lu 2004 additionally the n and p demands of different algae species are not the same when the growth of some algae is inhibited due to a shortage of a specific nutrient other algae species that require less of the nutrient can rapidly grow and become dominant in waterbodies as shown in fig 2 the 2 mib concentration in the wtp b raw water increased remarkably in 2016 in the same period the tp concentration and algae density increased while the tn concentration decreased generally an optimal nitrogen to phosphorus stoichiometry for algae growth exists n p atomic ratio 16 klausmeier et al 2004 redfield 1958 in our study the results show that the average nitrogen to phosphorus atomic stoichiometry was approximately 30 1 in the wtp b raw water thus the low p concentration may be the factor limiting the algae growth in the raw water explaining the algae density increased with an increase in the tp concentration in the waterbody according to fig 2a and c the tp concentration increased significantly in 2016 and the 2 mib concentration also increased at the same times moreover our study detected that the algae density of pseudanabaena which is a confirmed 2 mib producer increased significantly in 2016 in the raw water of wtp b therefore the 2 mib concentrations tend to increase in a high phosphorus waterbody ryota hino et al ryota et al 2017 also reported that 2 mib tended to increase when tp concentration exceeded 0 02 mg l and the control of nutrients concentrations in the waterbody was one of the important strategies for solving t o problems of drinking water which was in accordance with our conclusion as shown in fig 3 when the 2 mib concentration exceeded 150 ng l the n p ratios were all below 29 1 the 2 mib concentration was generally low when the n p ratios were high in the waterbody smith 1983 collected data from 17 lakes worldwide and concluded that when tn tp 29 1 by mass cyanobacteria tend to dominate in contrast when tn tp 29 1 by mass cyanobacteria are less dominant the results of their studies were consistent with those of our findings since 2 mib is mainly produced by the metabolism and biodegradation of some cyanobacteria srinivasan and sorial 2011 3 1 3 effect of light on the 2 mib concentration the light intensity is one of the major factors that affects the growth of 2 mib producing cyanobacteria the effect of variations in the light on the 2 mib concentration in the raw water was investigated in this study fig 4 shows the diurnal variation of the 2 mib concentration in the raw water from lake tai the 2 mib concentration during the day was obviously much higher than that at night by a factor of approximately 2 5 this phenomenon may be because the metabolic activity of 2 mib producing cyanobacteria increases and more 2 mib is produced during the day than at night some cyanobacteria may float to the surface during the day and move down to the bottom at night resulting in higher 2 mib concentration was detected in the water surface during the day it also might be one of the reasons to cause the 2 mib concentration change given that the diurnal temperature differences in the waterbody are not large the main cause of the 2 mib concentration variation may be the differences in light throughout the day the diurnal illuminance variation is also shown in fig 4 and it shows a great correlation with the changes of the total 2 mib concentration hence the 2 mib concentration appears to be correlated with the light and metabolic activity of 2 mib producing cyanobacteria 3 2 2 mib removal by different treatment units 3 2 1 relationship between the percentage of dissolved 2 mib and the total concentration of 2 mib 2 mib exists in both dissolved and bound forms fig 5 shows the dissolved and bound 2 mib concentrations in the raw water from lake tai in a period of 2012 the proportions of the two forms of 2 mib greatly varied with the location and time the percentage of dissolved 2 mib was approximately 40 90 and the average value was approximately 60 fig 6 indicates that a significant negative correlation exists between the percentage of dissolved 2 mib and the total 2 mib concentration i e the bound portion percentage is higher when the total 2 mib concentration is higher the relationship can be approximately described r2 0 7024 as an inverse exponential relationship hydraulic or wind factors causing 2 mib producing cyanobacteriafrom the bottom of the lake they are normally benthic to float may be the reason why the 2 mib concentration increased and more bound or intracellular 2 mib was measured in the raw water due to the flotation of benthic cyanobacteria cells 3 2 2 2 mib removal efficiency of different water treatment units fig 7 illustrates

18644,the potential risks of brominated flame retardants bfrs like tetrabromobisphenol a tbbpa have attracted much attention however the influence of tbbpa on functional microbes remains poorly understood especially with regards to denitrification which is closely related with the carbon and nitrogen cycles eutrophication and greenhouse gas emission herein we found that 1 0 mg l of tbbpa significantly decreased the total nitrogen removal efficiency by 81 7 but increased the accumulation of no2 n by 81 5 and n2o by 172 fold this was found to be underlie by the significant decrease in both the denitrifying capability of denitrifiers and total bacterial population further investigation revealed that tbbpa inhibited the pathways of glucolysis and pentose phosphate and promoted glyoxylate bypass via regulating genes expressions of key enzymes such as glucose 6 phosphate isomerase pyruvate dehydrogenase isocitrate lyase etc then decreased the generation of nadh serving as electron donor for denitrification and inhibited the denitrifying capability of denitrifiers moreover insufficient nadh stimulated the accumulation of denitrifying intermediates no2 n and n2o which induced the increase of reactive nitrogen species rns whose accumulation decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis of denitrifying bacteria finally the decrease in the denitrifying capability of denitrifier and bacterial population resulted in negative denitrifying performance graphical abstract image 1 keywords flame retardants tbbpa denitrification electron transport nadh 1 introduction tetrabromobisphenol a tbbpa is known as an efficient brominated flame retardants bfrs abundantly used in plastic textile and electrical circuit boards liu et al 2016 in 2013 the global production of tbbpa was estimated to 200 000 metric tons per year accounting for around 60 of total bfrs applications li et al 2015 yin et al 2018 about 20 30 vol of tbbpa produced were used as additive bfrs which could be easily released into the environment during the manufacture utilization and disposal of tbbpa containing products since there is no chemical bonding between the polymers and tbbpa colnot et

2013 yang et al 2012 with the increased risk of exposure the toxicological effects of tbbpa have been widely evaluated colnot et al 2014 halldin et al 2001 due to the similarity of chemical structure between tbbpa and the endocrine hormone tbbpa is generally regarded as a potential rodent carcinogen and endocrine disruptor inducing toxic effects on the thyroid immune and reproductive systems colnot et al 2014 yin et al 2018 another general concern of tbbpa is the elicited oxide stress by producing reactive oxygen species ros or decreasing the activity of anti oxidative enzymes which have been suggested as the principal mechanisms for depressing cell proliferation or encouraging cell apoptosis li et al 2008 szychowski et al 2016 yin et al 2018 furthermore disordering calcium homeostasis and altering signal transduction pathway have also been reported as other underlying mechanisms affecting cell death and development ogunbayo et al 2008 yin et al 2018 to date most previous studies of tbbpa were focused on its effect on morphology and growth using model organisms or cells e g rats knudsen et al 2018 lai et al 2015 zebrafish chen et al 2016 pittinger et al 2018 wheat li et al 2008 embryonic stem cells yin et al 2018 etc under the reported concentration levels canada 2013 wang et al 2015b it is estimated that the market demand for tbbpa would continue to increase liu et al 2016 in addition due to the high lipophilicity and octanol water partitioning coefficient log kow 4 50 6 53 tbbpa is very likely to deposit in sediment soil and sewage sludge malkoske et al 2016 for example the concentration range of tbbpa in surface sediment was n d 518 μg kg 1 dw in china liu et al 2016 the highest concentration reached to 914 μg kg 1 dw was detected in sediments sampling from e waste recycling and electronics manufacturing areas wang et al 2015a in wastewater treatment system tbbpa concentration in sewage sludge was ranged from 0 4 to 732 μg kg 1 dw in china which was comparable to those reported in other countries malkoske et al 2016 song et al 2014 all of these environmental medias such as sediments sewage sludge etc are closely relate to water environment security and especially inhabited by abundant functional microbes which play very important roles in various geographical processes such as nitrogen cycle and carbon cycle however the potential effect of tbbpa on functional microbes has never been reported this is addressed in this study as an ubiquitous process occurring in various natural environment or sewage treatment systems denitrification is responsible for the transformation of fixed nitrogen to gaseous nitrogen n2 which is closely related to eutrophication greenhouse gas n2o emission and carbon and nitrogen cycles ravishankara et al 2009 wan et al 2016 zheng et al 2014b it is well known that denitrification is carried out by a kind of heterotrophic bacteria termed denitrifier which could metabolize organic substrates for the growth of bacteria and denitrifying functions wan et al 2016 2018 therefore denitrification efficiency is closely dependent on the population of denitrifier or biomass and denitrifying capability of bacteria zheng et al 2014a 2014b during the denitrifying process the reduction of nitrogen oxide nox is driven by the electron provision transport and consumption system in denitrifiers electrons are primarily donated as nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nadh which derives from various metabolic pathways of organic substrate such as embden meyerhof parnas emp pathway pentose phosphate pp pathway and tricarboxylic acid tca cycle during glucose metabolism berks et al 1995 chen et al 2013 then the electrons are transduced from nadh to flavin mono nucletide fmn iron sulfur cluster quinone pool and cytochrome cyt c and finally consumed by nitrate reductase nar nitrite reductase nir nitric oxide reductase nor and nitrous oxide reductase nos which catalyze the sequential bioreductions of nitrate no3 n to nitrite no2 n nitric oxide no nitrous oxide n2o and n2 respectively richardson et al 1999 wan et al 2016 therefore any factor affecting carbon metabolism or electron transport and consumption would finally influence the denitrifying capability of denitrifiers however to date the potential risks of tbbpa on denitrifying bacteria especially carbon metabolism electron transport and consumption have not received much attention in this study the effects of tbbpa on denitrifying performance were firstly investigated subsequently the reasons for tbbpa inhibition of denitrification were explored via the assays of bacterial population and denitrifying capability of denitrifiers then the causes of tbbpa decreasing the growth of denitrifying bacteria were investigated by cell proliferation and apoptosis assay and the underlying mechanisms were studied on bacterial stress responses under anoxic condition simultaneously the causes of tbbpa inhibiting denitrifying capability of denitrifiers were investigated according to the electron flows from electron donor generated by carbon metabolism to transport and consumption process moreover the underlying mechanisms of potential effect of tbbpa on carbon metabolism electron transport and consumption were further unravelled by sequencing the expression level of relevant key genes this is the first systematic study exploring the influences of tbbpa on denitrificaiton performance especially on carbon metabolism electron transport and consumption process in denitrifiers 2 materials and methods 2 1 bacterial strain medium and conditions the denitrifying bacteria used in the current study was paracoccus denitrificans which has been used in previous studies as model organism to study denitrification performance electron transfer chain and energy conservation berks et al 1995 hahnke et al 2014 the strains of p denitrificans atcc 19367 was bought from american type culture collection manassas va usa and cultured in luria bertani lb broth as per our previous publication zheng et al 2014a after 24 h of cultivation the mixture was used as the inoculum for the subsequent experiments the denitrifying medium was prepared in distilled water and contained similar constituents as our previous study wan et al 2016 specifically 0 58 g l nh4cl 2 17 g l kno3 5 00 g l c6h12o6

2014 before cultivation the denitrifying medium was adjusted to a ph of 7 40 0 10 with 6 m naoh or hcl sterilized by autoclave at 121 c for 15 min and then cooled to room temperature 2 2 effect of tbbpa on denitrification and bacterial growth in the view of the concentration range of tbbpa in surface sediment and sewage sluge n d 914 μg kg 1 dw the potential effects of six levels 0 control 0 05

volume of 100 ml the test group adding 100 μl ethanol without tbbpa was set as the control during the experiment in this study the p denitrificans cultures were inoculated into the targeted medium at an initial bacterial density of od600 0 040 then after deoxygenating by flushing with argon for 5 min all bottles were sealed and placed in a water bath shaker 150 rpm at 28 1 c the bacterial suspensions were sampled with a syringe at 4 h intervals for 24 h the concentrations of no3 n no2 n n2o and glucose and bacterial population expressed as od600 or mg dw dry weight of the bacteria were determined as per our previous publications wan et al 2016 zheng et al 2014b 2 3 effect of tbbpa on denitrifying function of bacteria in order to explore the effects of tbbpa on the denitrifying capability of the denitrifiers an acute toxicity test was conducted briefly p denitrificans were cultured in the denitrifying medium without tbbpa addition and the same experiment protocols as the control group in section 2 2 were implemented after 13 h cultivation the bacteria were harvested by centrifugation for 5 min at 4000 g rinsed twice with phosphate buffered saline pbs 50 mm ph 7 40 and re suspended with the pbs the same volume 5 ml of bacterial re suspension was inoculated in each serum bottles with a volume of 100 ml containing 45 ml denitrifying medium at the initial od600 0 692

corresponding bottles to ensure the initial tbbpa concentrations were 0 0 50 and 0 75 mg l then the subsequent experimental procedures were the same as that described in section 2 2 the concentrations of no3 n no2 n glucose and bacterial population od600 were measured at 0 5 h intervals for 2 h and the variation of bacterial biomass were also determined 2 4 rna sequencing rna seq an transcriptome

corp armonk ny usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of tbbpa on denitrification performance the denitrifying profiles of p denitrificans at different concentrations 0 0 05 0 10 0 50 0 75 and 1 00 mg l of tbbpa are shown in fig 1 clearly the denitrification performances at the tbbpa concentrations of 0 05 and 0 10 mg l were similar to that of the control fig 1a b 1c and 1d suggesting that lower concentrations 0 10 mg l of tbbpa had negligible influence on denitrification however remarkable inhibition on denitrification was observed when the concentration of tbbpa was 0 50 mg l and above specifically at the end of 24 h the final nitrate concentration fig 1a was only 0 47 mg l in the control but reached 39 09 86 08 and 201 43 mg l following treatment with 0 50 mg l 0 75 mg l and 1 00 mg l of tbbpa respectively similarly as shown in fig 1c the total nitrogen tn represents no3 n no2 n removal efficiency was also significantly decreased from 99 80 control to as much as 18 10 for the highest tbbpa concentration of 1 00 mg l no2 n and n2o are two important intermediates produced during denitrification that are highly toxic wan et al 2016 no2 n is known as a methemoglobin forming agent and carcinogen for human beings ansari et al 2017 and nitrous oxide n2o is a powerful greenhouse gas controlled under the kyoto protocol ravishankara et al 2009 similar to the performance of no3 n and tn fig 1b and d shows that significant accumulation of no2 n and n2o was only observed when the concentration of tbbpa was over 0 5 mg l at the end of 24 h the no2 n conversion ratio figs s1 and si was remarkably increased from 0 04 control to between 53 20 and 81 49 for tbbpa concentrations of between 0 50 and 1 00 mg l of the tn removal whilst n2o emission potential was 0 005 μg n mg tn removal in the absence of tbbpa it was significantly increased to 0 72 0 87 and 1 36 μg n mg tn removal as the tbbpa concentration increased to 0 50 mg l 0 75 mg l and 1 00 mg l respectively according to the previous reports liu et al 2016 pittinger et al 2018 the concentration of tbbpa in sediment and sewage sludge was increasing to as high as 9 75 mg kg dw due to the high lipophilicity and octanol water partitioning coefficient of tbbpa this study indicated that denitrification process has been significantly influenced by tbbpa in some microenvironments even under the current concentration level the inhibitory effect high concentrations of tbbpa 0 50 mg l on denitrification is explored in the following section 3 2 tbbpa affecting the bacterial population of denitrifier 3 2 1 effect of tbbpa on the growth of denitrifying bacteria it is well known that bio denitrification is driven by individual denitrifying bacteria thus the population of bacteria or biomass plays an important role during denitrification process fig 2 illustrates the effect of different concentrations of tbbpa on bacterial growth od600 value of p denitrificans as shown in fig 2a after the adaptation phase 0 8 h negligible difference p 0 05 was observed between the lower concentrations of tbbpa 0 1 mg l tbbpa groups and the control however at the higher concentrations of tbbpa 0 50 mg l the bacterial density od600 was significantly decreased compared with the control further analysis in fig 2b illustrates that the average biomass growth rate rdenitrifier had a negative linear correlation with the concentration of tbbpa at a tbbpa concentration of 0 1 0 mg l the average biomass growth rate and tbbpa concentration had the following relationship rdenitrifier 1 69 1 18 ctbbpa r2 0 9933 rdenitrifier is the average biomass growth rate of denitrifiers during the experiment 0 24 h in this study mg dw h and ctbbpa is the concentration of tbbpa mg l fig 2 thereby affirms that the inhibitory effect of tbbpa on bacterial density or biomass was an important reason affecting the denitrification performance fig 1 previous studies also demonstrated that the biomass of organisms was decreased in the presence of high concentration of tbbpa in tbbpa degradation systems fan et al 2017 peng et al 2013 but the underlying inhibition mechanism by tbbpa on the growth of denitrifying bacteria is still unclear this is addressed in the following 3 2 2 how does tbbpa inhibit the growth of p denitrificans since the bacterial density od600 was closely related the reproduction and mortality of the bacteria zhong et al 2014 the effect of tbbpa on the proliferation and apoptosis of p denitrificans was analyzed using the cck 8 and pi methods respectively as shown in fig 3 a fluorescence intensity of the reproductive indicator in cck 8 was significantly decreased by 19 32 with the increase of tbbpa concentration from 0 to 1 00 mg l suggesting that the proliferation of p denitrificans was significantly inhibited by the presence of tbbpa 0 5 mg l additionally cell apoptosis assay fig 3b showed that a significant increase of cell apoptosis was inducted by tbbpa in a concentration dependent manner as the concentration was over 0 50 mg l therefore it can be concluded that the presence of tbbpa finally inhibited the population growth or biomass of denitrifying bacteria fig 2 by inhibiting the proliferation and accelerating the apoptosis of p denitrificans previous studies indicated that the proliferation and apoptosis of bacteria were closely related to intracellular redox homeostasis especially when the bacteria interacted with exogenous pollutants weidinger et al 2015 generally the intracellular redox homeostasis can be regulated by the variation of reactive oxygen and reactive nitrogen species rons which were even suggested as the critical signaling molecules for cell proliferation and survival ray et al 2012 in this study the exposure to tbbpa resulted in a slight though not statistically significant p 0 05 increase of intracellular ros concentration in p denitrificans fig 4 a presumably due to extremely low molecular oxygen concentration in the anoxic denitrifying system however the reactive nitrogen species rns concentration in p denitrificans significantly increased with the increase of tbbpa concentration fig 4b rns such as nitric oxide no and peroxynitrite onoo has generally been reported as the byproducts during electron transfer chain with the participation of nox n weidinger et al 2015 in the current study nox n load and the intermediates e g no2 n which were both remarkably increased in denitrifiers after exposure to tbbpa figs s1 and s2 provided a greater number of precursors for the formation of rns the accumulation of strong oxidizing agents i e rns attacked bio macromolecules e g nucleic acids proteins and phospholipids damaged the intracellular redox homeostasis weidinger et al 2015 and eventually affected the bacterial proliferation and apoptosis profiles of p denitrificans in this study 3 3 tbbpa influencing denitrifying function of p denitrificans besides the bacterial population fig 2 the denitrifying capability of bacteria also play a vital role in the performance of every denitrification system the variation of no3 n tn glucose and biomass were presented in fig s3 si after an acute exposure to tbbpa then the effects of tbbpa on specific denitrifying activity of p denitrificans were further calculated after excluding the influence of bacterial growth as presented in fig 5 as seen in fig 5a the specific no3 n removal rate of the control group was 89 06 mg n g dw h 1 which was higher than those reported in literature 19 50 mg n g mlss h glass et al 1999 it is because that p denitrificans used in this study is a kind of specialized denitrifying bacteria whose denitrifying capability is higher than that of activated sludge however the specific no3 n removal rate was significantly decreased to 74 25 and 70 25 mg n g dw h 1 as tbbpa concentration increased from 0 50 to 0 75 mg l tbbpa moreover the specific tn removal rate also decreased with the increase of tbbpa concentration fig 5b these results indicate that tbbpa inhibited not only the biomass of p denitrificans but also the denitrifying capability of bacteria armed with the understanding that bio denitrification is driven by electron production transport and consumption in denitrifying bacteria berks et al 1995 chen et al 2013 the reasons for tbbpa inhibiting the denitrifying capability of individual denitrifiers are explored in the following 3 3 1 tbbpa decreased electron donation for denitrifiers during denitrification the reduction of nox no3 n no2 n no etc require electrons which are primarily originated from the oxidation of nadh or succinate berks et al 1995 chen et al 2013 correspondingly the effect of tbbpa on intracellular nadh concentration in p denitrificans was determined because that nadh was the mainly byproduct during the metabolism of glucose which served as the sole carbon substrate in the current study as shown in fig 6 relative to the control the intracellular nadh concentration was similar for the tbbpa concentration of 0 10 mg l p 0 05 but remarkably decreased by 13 60 and 38 69 following exposure to 0 50 mg l and 1 00 mg l tbbpa respectively this indicates that higher concentrations of tbbpa 0 5 mg l exposure elicited fewer nadh generation which induced fewer electrons donation for the reduction of nox in individual denitrifiers and thereby deteriorated the denitrification performance fig 1 in addition it has been reported that the accumulation of denitrifying intermediates no2 n no and n2o was more likely to observed especially under the electron donor limiting conditions due to the electron competition between denitrifying enzymes betlach et al 1981 pan et al 2013 thus the decrease of nadh production caused by tbbpa exposure was also responsible for the accumulation of denitrifying intermediates no2 n and n2o shown in fig 1 since it is well known that nadh is mainly derived from carbon metabolism chen et al 2013 wan et al 2018 the influence of tbbpa on carbon utilization by p denitrificans was then investigated to explore why tbbpa inhibited nadh production 3 3 2 tbbpa regulated carbon metabolism to decrease nadh generation as in previous studies glucose has been commonly used as the mode carbon substrate for denitrification pan et al 2015 zheng et al 2014b in this study the effect of tbbpa on glucose utilization by p denitrificans is presented in fig 7 a while the control and 0 10 mg l tbbpa gave similar glucose utilization profiles the amount of residual glucose concentration significantly increased from 1 45 g l for the control to up to 3 17 g l for 1 00 g l of tbbpa at the initial glucose concentration 4 55 g l suggesting that the glucose consumption decreased by up to 37 80 as the tbbpa concentration increased from 0 mg l control to 1 00 mg l this demonstrates that high concentrations tbbpa 0 5 mg l inhibited denitrifiers carbon utilization then induced the decrease of nadh provision fig 6 for denitrification as shown in fig 7c nadh could be derived from various metabolic pathways such as emp pathway tca cycle in p denitrificans berks et al 1995 chen et al 2013 but the underlying mechanism of how tbbpa affects carbon metabolism to lead to a decrease of nadh production needs further investigation it is well known that the carbon metabolism pathway is largely dependent on the catalysis of relevant enzymes encoded by corresponding genes zheng et al 2014b the differential expression of genes in p denitrificans which were cultured in the absence and presence of 0 75 mg l tbbpa was analyzed via rna sequencing fig 7b and c and s4 present the transcriptional levels of key genes involved in the central carbon metabolism pathways as the first phase of glucose metabolism fig 7c two canonical pathways exist namely glycolysis emp pathway and pp pathway which are both closely concerned with intracellular nadh generation christensen et al 1999 even though the emp pathway has been reported as the ubiquitous metabolism pathway for glucose in various modern bacteria romano et al 1996 we found that the transcriptional level of key enzymes involving not only emp pathway such as glucose 6 phosphate isomerase ec 5 3 1 9 pyruvate dehydrogenase ec 1 2 4 1 or 2 3 1 12 but also pp pathway such as glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase ec 1 1 1 49 or 1 1 1 363 6 phosphogluconolactonase ec 3 1 1 31 and phosphogluconate dehydratase ec 4 2 1 12 were all significantly down regulated in the presence of tbbpa in this study wang et al 2010 apparently the down regulation of genes encoding key enzymes involving glucose metabolism was responsible for the decreased utilization of glucose fig 7a when the denitrifiers were exposed to 0 75 mg l tbbpa as shown in fig 7c these above down regulated genes either controlled the upstream of glucose metabolism e g ec 5 3 1 9 ec 1 1 1 49 or 1 1 1 363 ec 3 1 1 31 or directly regulated the nadh generation e g ec 1 2 4 1 or 2 3 1 12 which was one of the underlying reasons for the decrease of nadh concentration caused by tbbpa the tca cycle is known as the second phase of glucose metabolism which is another important source for nadh production in p denitrificans berks et al 1995 during the reactions of the tca cycle 3 mol of nad nadp are reduced to nadh or nadph by oxidizing 1 mol of acetyl coa mayes et al 2003 moreover it is well known that the tca cycle coupled with an important bypass named the glyoxylate cycle fig 7c and s4 wang et al 2010 during this bypass isocitrate is directly converted into glyoxylate and succinate instead of α ketoglutarate by isocitrate lyase subsequently with the catalysis of malate synthase glyoxylate then combined with acetyl coa to generate malate in the current study compared with the control it is interesting to find that the gene expression of key enzymes involved in glyoxylate bypass such as isocitrate lyase ec 4 1 3 1 and malate synthase ec 2 3 3 9 were remarkably up regulated in p denitrificans with exposure to 0 75 mg l tbbpa however the gene expression s variation of key enzymes involving conventional tca cycle was negligible suggesting that the presence of tbbpa promoted the glyoxylate bypass rather than the conventional tca cycle during glucose metabolism in p denitrificans as shown in fig 7c it is notable that the amount of nadh or nadph generated in the glyoxylate cycle was much less than that in the tca cycle mayes et al 2003 wang et al 2010 therefore serving as an intracellular metabolism disruptor tbbpa may regulate the metabolic flux of glucose via inhibiting emp and pp pathways and stimulating the glyoxylate bypass to decrease the generation of nadh in p denitrificans fig 6 3 3 3 effect of tbbpa on electron transport and consumption of p denitrificans during denitrification as shown in fig 8 a the nadh generated from carbon metabolism is oxidized and electrons are transferred via electron transfer chain mainly consisting of fmn iron sulfur clusters quinone pool and cyt c then consumed by nox reductases nar nir nor and nos berks et al 1995 chen et al 2013 after identifying by rna seq the degs were analyzed with the help of go and ncbi database with relevant results presented in fig 8 and table s1 si as shown in tables s1 and 133 degs involved in electron transport and consumption were identified the amount of up regulated genes 90 genes were observed to be significantly more than the down regulated ones 43 genes in which 11 significantly expressed genes were all up regulated seeing in table s1 and fig 8b specifically genes of pden 1119 and pden 4789 were identified to respectively encode nadh ubiquinone oxidoreductase and nadph dependent fmn reductase both of which played important roles in electrons transduction from nadh to quinone pool chen et al 2013 friedrich et al 2016 morever five significantly up regulated genes were identified to encode cyt c pden 2544 pden 0893 pden 4700 and pden 0021 and cyt b pden 3286 which were all reported as the electron carriers to transfer electrons from quinone pool to reductases of nir nor or nos miyata et al 1969 perin et al 1988 in addition seventeen genes encoding key denitrification enzymes nar nir nor and nos were detected in this study but there was only one up regulated gene pden 4216 encoding nitrous oxide maturation protein nosy was expressed significantly table s1 and fig s5 all of these data indicate that the presence of tbbpa might not inhibit but accelerate the electron transport and consumption processes in p denitrificans obviously the positive responses of electron transport and consumption to tbbpa fig 8 were not perfectly consistent with the actual denitrification performance fig 1 it is well known that the ultimate profiles of electron transport and consumption are largely dependent on the upstream production of electron donor which is generated from carbon substrate metabolism wan et al 2018 however in the current study the production of nadh significantly decreased with the increase of tbbpa via inhibiting the pathways of emp and pp and promoting glyoxylate bypass the decreasing of nadh directly suppressed the activity of key denitrifying enzymes fig s6 thus it can be concluded that the inhibitory effect of tbbpa on nadh production via regulating intracellular carbon metabolism was the critical cause for the negative denitrifying performance of the individual denitrifier even the electron transport and consumption system might be activated by tbbpa 4 conclusion as seen from this study via regulating the gene expression of key enzymes involved in carbon metabolism tbbpa inhibited the metabolism pathways of emp and pp and promoted the glyoxylate bypass which decreased the generation of intracellular nadh that served as the primarily electron donors for denitrification on one hand the decrease of nadh caused by tbbpa directly limited the denitrifying capability of individual denitrifiers on the other hand insufficient electron donor nadh intensified the electron competition between key denitrifying enzymes nar nir nor and nos leading to the accumulation of denitrifying intermediates no2 n no and n2o the accumulation of denitrifying intermediates enhanced intracellular rns generation which further induced the decrease of bacterial population via suppressing proliferation and increasing apoptosis of the denitrifiers therefore both the decrease of the denitrifying capability of denitrifiers and bacterial population finally led to the inhibitory effect of tbbpa on denitrification acting not only as an endocrine disruptor tbbpa also disrupted intracellular carbon metabolism pathway in denitrifiers these influences warrant more attention

18644,the potential risks of brominated flame retardants bfrs like tetrabromobisphenol a tbbpa have attracted much attention however the influence of tbbpa on functional microbes remains poorly understood especially with regards to denitrification which is closely related with the carbon and nitrogen cycles eutrophication and greenhouse gas emission herein we found that 1 0 mg l of tbbpa significantly decreased the total nitrogen removal efficiency by 81 7 but increased the accumulation of no2 n by 81 5 and n2o by 172 fold this was found to be underlie by the significant decrease in both the denitrifying capability of denitrifiers and total bacterial population further investigation revealed that tbbpa inhibited the pathways of glucolysis and pentose phosphate and promoted glyoxylate bypass via regulating genes expressions of key enzymes such as glucose 6 phosphate isomerase pyruvate dehydrogenase isocitrate lyase etc then decreased the generation of nadh serving as electron donor for denitrification and inhibited the denitrifying capability of denitrifiers moreover insufficient nadh stimulated the accumulation of denitrifying intermediates no2 n and n2o which induced the increase of reactive nitrogen species rns whose accumulation decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis of denitrifying bacteria finally the decrease in the denitrifying capability of denitrifier and bacterial population resulted in negative denitrifying performance graphical abstract image 1 keywords flame retardants tbbpa denitrification electron transport nadh 1 introduction

tbbpa was estimated to 200 000 metric tons per year accounting for around 60 of total bfrs applications li et al 2015 yin et al 2018 about 20 30 vol of tbbpa produced were used as additive bfrs which could be easily released into the environment during the manufacture utilization and disposal of tbbpa containing products since there is no chemical bonding between the polymers and tbbpa colnot et al 2014 liu et al 2016 therefore tbbpa has become a worldwide contaminant which has been detected in various environmental matrices gorga et al 2013 liu et al 2016 2017 malkoske et al 2016 ni et al 2013 yang et al 2012 with the increased risk of exposure the toxicological effects of tbbpa have been widely evaluated colnot et al 2014 halldin et al 2001 due to the similarity of chemical structure between tbbpa and the endocrine hormone tbbpa is generally regarded as a potential rodent carcinogen and endocrine disruptor inducing toxic effects on the thyroid immune and reproductive systems colnot et al 2014 yin et al 2018 another general concern of tbbpa is the elicited oxide stress by producing reactive oxygen species ros or decreasing the activity of anti oxidative enzymes which have been suggested as the principal mechanisms for depressing cell proliferation or encouraging cell apoptosis li et al 2008 szychowski et al 2016 yin et al 2018 furthermore disordering calcium homeostasis and altering signal transduction pathway have also been reported as other underlying mechanisms affecting cell death and development ogunbayo et al 2008 yin et al 2018 to date most previous studies of tbbpa were focused on its effect on morphology and growth using model organisms or cells e g rats knudsen et al 2018 lai et al 2015 zebrafish chen et al 2016 pittinger et al 2018 wheat li et al 2008 embryonic stem cells yin et al 2018 etc under the reported concentration levels canada 2013 wang et al 2015b it is estimated that the market demand for tbbpa would continue to increase liu et al 2016 in addition due to the high lipophilicity and octanol water partitioning coefficient log kow 4 50 6 53 tbbpa is very likely to deposit in sediment soil and sewage sludge malkoske et al 2016 for example the concentration range of tbbpa in surface sediment was n d 518 μg kg 1 dw in china liu et al 2016 the highest concentration reached to 914 μg kg 1 dw was detected in sediments sampling from e waste recycling and electronics manufacturing areas wang et al 2015a in wastewater treatment system tbbpa concentration in sewage sludge was ranged from 0 4 to 732 μg kg 1 dw in china which was comparable to those reported in other countries malkoske et al 2016 song et al 2014 all of these environmental medias such as sediments sewage sludge etc are closely relate to water environment security and especially inhabited by abundant functional microbes which play very important roles in various geographical processes such as nitrogen cycle and carbon cycle however the potential effect of tbbpa on functional microbes has never been reported this is addressed in this study as an ubiquitous process occurring in various natural environment or sewage treatment systems denitrification is responsible for the transformation of fixed nitrogen to gaseous nitrogen n2 which is closely related to eutrophication greenhouse gas n2o emission and carbon and nitrogen cycles ravishankara et al 2009 wan et al 2016 zheng et al 2014b it is well known that denitrification is carried out by a kind of heterotrophic bacteria termed denitrifier which could metabolize organic substrates for the growth of bacteria and denitrifying functions wan et al 2016 2018 therefore denitrification efficiency is closely dependent on the population of denitrifier or biomass and denitrifying capability of bacteria zheng et al 2014a 2014b during the denitrifying process the reduction of nitrogen oxide nox is driven by the electron provision transport and consumption system in denitrifiers electrons are primarily donated as nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nadh which derives from various metabolic pathways of organic substrate such as embden meyerhof parnas emp pathway pentose phosphate pp pathway and tricarboxylic acid tca cycle during glucose metabolism berks et al 1995 chen et al 2013 then the electrons are transduced from nadh to flavin mono nucletide fmn iron sulfur cluster quinone pool and cytochrome cyt c and finally consumed by nitrate reductase nar nitrite reductase nir nitric oxide reductase nor and nitrous oxide reductase nos which catalyze the sequential bioreductions of nitrate no3 n to nitrite no2 n nitric oxide no nitrous oxide n2o and n2 respectively richardson et al 1999 wan et al 2016 therefore any factor affecting carbon metabolism or electron transport and consumption would finally influence the denitrifying capability of denitrifiers however to date the potential risks of tbbpa on denitrifying bacteria especially carbon metabolism electron transport and consumption have not received much attention in this study the effects of tbbpa on denitrifying performance were firstly investigated subsequently the reasons for tbbpa inhibition of denitrification were explored via the assays of bacterial population and denitrifying capability of denitrifiers then the causes of tbbpa decreasing the growth of denitrifying bacteria were investigated by cell proliferation and apoptosis assay and the underlying mechanisms were studied on bacterial stress responses under anoxic condition simultaneously the causes of tbbpa inhibiting denitrifying capability of denitrifiers were investigated according to the electron flows from electron donor generated by carbon metabolism to transport and consumption process moreover the underlying mechanisms of potential effect of tbbpa on carbon metabolism electron transport and consumption were further unravelled by sequencing the expression level of relevant key genes this is the first systematic study exploring the influences of tbbpa on denitrificaiton performance especially on carbon metabolism electron transport and consumption process in denitrifiers 2 materials and methods 2 1 bacterial strain medium and conditions the denitrifying bacteria used in the current study was paracoccus denitrificans which has been used in previous studies as model organism to study denitrification performance electron transfer chain and energy conservation berks et al 1995 hahnke et al 2014 the strains of p denitrificans atcc 19367 was bought from american type culture collection manassas va usa and cultured in luria bertani lb broth as per our previous publication zheng et al 2014a after 24 h of cultivation the mixture was used as the inoculum for the subsequent experiments the denitrifying medium was prepared in distilled water and contained similar constituents as our previous study wan et al 2016 specifically 0 58 g l nh4cl 2 17 g l kno3 5 00 g l c6h12o6

2014 before cultivation the denitrifying medium was adjusted to a ph of 7 40 0 10 with 6 m naoh or hcl sterilized by autoclave at 121 c for 15 min and then cooled to room temperature 2 2 effect of

volume of 100 ml the test group adding 100 μl ethanol without tbbpa was set as the control during the experiment in this study the p denitrificans cultures were inoculated into the targeted medium at an initial bacterial density of od600 0 040 then after deoxygenating by flushing with argon for 5 min all bottles were sealed and placed in a water bath shaker 150 rpm at 28 1 c the bacterial suspensions were sampled with a syringe at 4 h intervals for 24 h the concentrations of no3 n no2 n n2o and glucose and bacterial population expressed as od600 or mg dw dry weight of the bacteria were determined as per our previous publications wan et al 2016 zheng et al 2014b 2 3 effect of tbbpa on denitrifying function of bacteria in order to explore the effects of tbbpa on the denitrifying capability of the denitrifiers an acute toxicity test was conducted briefly p denitrificans were cultured in the denitrifying medium without tbbpa addition and the same experiment protocols as the control group in section 2 2 were implemented after 13 h cultivation the bacteria were harvested by centrifugation for 5 min at 4000 g rinsed twice with phosphate buffered saline pbs 50 mm ph 7 40 and re suspended with the pbs the same volume 5 ml of bacterial re suspension was inoculated in each serum bottles with a volume of 100 ml containing 45 ml denitrifying medium at the initial od600 0 692

corresponding bottles to ensure the initial tbbpa concentrations were 0 0 50 and 0 75 mg l then the subsequent experimental procedures were the same as that described in section 2 2 the concentrations of no3 n no2 n glucose and bacterial population od600 were measured at 0 5 h intervals for 2 h and the variation of bacterial biomass were also determined 2 4 rna sequencing rna seq an transcriptome

corp armonk ny usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of tbbpa on denitrification performance the denitrifying profiles of p denitrificans at different concentrations 0 0 05 0 10 0 50 0 75 and 1 00 mg l of tbbpa are shown in fig 1 clearly the denitrification performances at the tbbpa concentrations of 0 05 and 0 10 mg l were similar to that of the control fig 1a b 1c and 1d suggesting that lower concentrations 0 10 mg l of tbbpa had negligible influence on denitrification however remarkable inhibition on denitrification was observed when the concentration of tbbpa was 0 50 mg l and above specifically at the end of 24 h the final nitrate concentration fig 1a was only 0 47 mg l in the control but reached 39 09 86 08 and 201 43 mg l following treatment with 0 50 mg l 0 75 mg l and 1 00 mg l of tbbpa respectively similarly as shown in fig 1c the total nitrogen tn represents no3 n no2 n removal efficiency was also significantly decreased from 99 80 control to as much as 18 10 for the highest tbbpa concentration of 1 00 mg l no2 n and n2o are two important intermediates produced during denitrification that are highly toxic wan et al 2016 no2 n is known as a methemoglobin forming agent and carcinogen for human beings ansari et al 2017 and nitrous oxide n2o is a powerful greenhouse gas controlled under the kyoto protocol ravishankara et al 2009 similar to the performance of no3 n and tn fig 1b and d shows that significant accumulation of no2 n and n2o was only observed when the concentration of tbbpa was over 0 5 mg l at the end of 24 h the no2 n conversion ratio figs s1 and si was remarkably increased from 0 04 control to between 53 20 and 81 49 for tbbpa concentrations of between 0 50 and 1 00 mg l of the tn removal whilst n2o emission potential was 0 005 μg n mg tn removal in the absence of tbbpa it was significantly increased to 0 72 0 87 and 1 36 μg n mg tn removal as the tbbpa concentration increased to 0 50 mg l 0 75 mg l and 1 00 mg l respectively according to the previous reports liu et al 2016 pittinger et al 2018 the concentration of tbbpa in sediment and sewage sludge was increasing to as high as 9 75 mg kg dw due to the high lipophilicity and octanol water partitioning coefficient of tbbpa this study indicated that denitrification process has been significantly influenced by tbbpa in some microenvironments even under the current concentration level the inhibitory effect high concentrations of tbbpa 0 50 mg l on denitrification is explored in the following section 3 2 tbbpa affecting the bacterial population of denitrifier 3 2 1 effect of tbbpa on the growth of denitrifying bacteria it is well known that bio denitrification is driven by individual denitrifying bacteria thus the population of bacteria or biomass plays an important role during denitrification process fig 2 illustrates the effect of different concentrations of tbbpa on bacterial growth od600 value of p denitrificans as shown in fig 2a after the adaptation phase 0 8 h negligible difference p 0 05 was observed between the lower concentrations of tbbpa 0 1 mg l tbbpa groups and the control however at the higher concentrations of tbbpa 0 50 mg l the bacterial density od600 was significantly decreased compared with the control further analysis in fig 2b illustrates that the average biomass growth rate rdenitrifier had a negative linear correlation with the concentration of tbbpa at a tbbpa concentration of 0 1 0 mg l the average biomass growth rate and tbbpa concentration had the following relationship rdenitrifier 1 69 1 18 ctbbpa r2 0 9933 rdenitrifier is the average biomass growth rate of denitrifiers during the experiment 0 24 h in this study mg dw h and ctbbpa is the concentration of tbbpa mg l fig 2 thereby affirms that the inhibitory effect of tbbpa on bacterial density or biomass was an important reason affecting the denitrification performance fig 1 previous studies also demonstrated that the biomass of organisms was decreased in the presence of high concentration of tbbpa in tbbpa degradation systems fan et al 2017 peng et al 2013 but the underlying inhibition mechanism by tbbpa on the growth of denitrifying bacteria is still unclear this is addressed in the following 3 2 2 how does tbbpa inhibit the growth of p denitrificans since the bacterial density od600 was closely related the reproduction and mortality of the bacteria zhong et al 2014 the effect of tbbpa on the proliferation and apoptosis of p denitrificans was analyzed using the cck 8 and pi methods respectively as shown in fig 3 a fluorescence intensity of the reproductive indicator in cck 8 was significantly decreased by 19 32 with the increase of tbbpa concentration from 0 to 1 00 mg l suggesting that the proliferation of p denitrificans was significantly inhibited by the presence of tbbpa 0 5 mg l additionally cell apoptosis assay fig 3b showed that a significant increase of cell apoptosis was inducted by tbbpa in a concentration dependent manner as the concentration was over 0 50 mg l therefore it can be concluded that the presence of tbbpa finally inhibited the population growth or biomass of denitrifying bacteria fig 2 by inhibiting the proliferation and accelerating the apoptosis of p denitrificans previous studies indicated that the proliferation and apoptosis of bacteria were closely related to intracellular redox homeostasis especially when the bacteria interacted with exogenous pollutants weidinger et al 2015 generally the intracellular redox homeostasis can be regulated by the variation of reactive oxygen and reactive nitrogen species rons which were even suggested as the critical signaling molecules for cell proliferation and survival ray et al 2012 in this study the exposure to tbbpa resulted in a slight though not statistically significant p 0 05 increase of intracellular ros concentration in p denitrificans fig 4 a presumably due to extremely low molecular oxygen concentration in the anoxic denitrifying system however the reactive nitrogen species rns concentration in p denitrificans significantly increased with the increase of tbbpa concentration fig 4b rns such as nitric oxide no and peroxynitrite onoo has generally been reported as the byproducts during electron transfer chain with the participation of nox n weidinger et al 2015 in the current study nox n load and the intermediates e g no2 n which were both remarkably increased in denitrifiers after exposure to tbbpa figs s1 and s2 provided a greater number of precursors for the formation of rns the accumulation of strong oxidizing agents i e rns attacked bio macromolecules e g nucleic acids proteins and phospholipids damaged the intracellular redox homeostasis weidinger et al 2015 and eventually affected the bacterial proliferation and apoptosis profiles of p denitrificans in this study 3 3 tbbpa influencing denitrifying function of p denitrificans besides the bacterial population fig 2 the denitrifying capability of bacteria also play a vital role in the performance of every denitrification system the variation of no3 n tn glucose and biomass were presented in fig s3 si after an acute exposure to tbbpa then the effects of tbbpa on specific denitrifying activity of p denitrificans were further calculated after excluding the influence of bacterial growth as presented in fig 5 as seen in fig 5a the specific no3 n removal rate of the control group was 89 06 mg n g dw h 1 which was higher than those reported in literature 19 50 mg n g mlss h glass et al 1999 it is because that p denitrificans used in this study is a kind of specialized denitrifying bacteria whose denitrifying capability is higher than that of activated sludge however the specific no3 n removal rate was significantly decreased to 74 25 and 70 25 mg n g dw h 1 as tbbpa concentration increased from 0 50 to 0 75 mg l tbbpa moreover the specific tn removal rate also decreased with the increase of tbbpa concentration fig 5b these results indicate that tbbpa inhibited not only the biomass of p denitrificans but also the denitrifying capability of bacteria armed with the understanding that bio denitrification is driven by electron production transport and consumption in denitrifying bacteria berks et al 1995 chen et al 2013 the reasons for tbbpa inhibiting the denitrifying capability of individual denitrifiers are explored in the following 3 3 1 tbbpa decreased electron donation for denitrifiers during denitrification the reduction of nox no3 n no2 n no etc require electrons which are primarily originated from the oxidation of nadh or succinate berks et al 1995 chen et al 2013 correspondingly the effect of tbbpa on intracellular nadh concentration in p denitrificans was determined because that nadh was the mainly byproduct during the metabolism of glucose which served as the sole carbon substrate in the current study as shown in fig 6 relative to the control the intracellular nadh concentration was similar for the tbbpa concentration of 0 10 mg l p 0 05 but remarkably decreased by 13 60 and 38 69 following exposure to 0 50 mg l and 1 00 mg l tbbpa respectively this indicates that higher concentrations of tbbpa 0 5 mg l exposure elicited fewer nadh generation which induced fewer electrons donation for the reduction of nox in individual denitrifiers and thereby deteriorated the denitrification performance fig 1 in addition it has been reported that the accumulation of denitrifying intermediates no2 n no and n2o was more likely to observed especially under the electron donor limiting conditions due to the electron competition between denitrifying enzymes betlach et al 1981 pan et al 2013 thus the decrease of nadh production caused by tbbpa exposure was also responsible for the accumulation of denitrifying intermediates no2 n and n2o shown in fig 1 since it is well known that nadh is mainly derived from carbon metabolism chen et al 2013 wan et al 2018 the influence of tbbpa on carbon utilization by p denitrificans was then investigated to explore why tbbpa inhibited nadh production 3 3 2 tbbpa regulated carbon metabolism to decrease nadh generation as in previous studies glucose has been commonly used as the mode carbon substrate for denitrification pan et al 2015 zheng et al 2014b in this study the effect of tbbpa on glucose utilization by p denitrificans is presented in fig 7 a while the control and 0 10 mg l tbbpa gave similar glucose utilization profiles the amount of residual glucose concentration significantly increased from 1 45 g l for the control to up to 3 17 g l for 1 00 g l of tbbpa at the initial glucose concentration 4 55 g l suggesting that the glucose consumption decreased by up to 37 80 as the tbbpa concentration increased from 0 mg l control to 1 00 mg l this demonstrates that high concentrations tbbpa 0 5 mg l inhibited denitrifiers carbon utilization then induced the decrease of nadh provision fig 6 for denitrification as shown in fig 7c nadh could be derived from various metabolic pathways such as emp pathway tca cycle in p denitrificans berks et al 1995 chen et al 2013 but the underlying mechanism of how tbbpa affects carbon metabolism to lead to a decrease of nadh production needs further investigation it is well known that the carbon metabolism pathway is largely dependent on the catalysis of relevant enzymes encoded by corresponding genes zheng et al 2014b the differential expression of genes in p denitrificans which were cultured in the absence and presence of 0 75 mg l tbbpa was analyzed via rna sequencing fig 7b and c and s4 present the transcriptional levels of key genes involved in the central carbon metabolism pathways as the first phase of glucose metabolism fig 7c two canonical pathways exist namely glycolysis emp pathway and pp pathway which are both closely concerned with intracellular nadh generation christensen et al 1999 even though the emp pathway has been reported as the ubiquitous metabolism pathway for glucose in various modern bacteria romano et al 1996 we found that the transcriptional level of key enzymes involving not only emp pathway such as glucose 6 phosphate isomerase ec 5 3 1 9 pyruvate dehydrogenase ec 1 2 4 1 or 2 3 1 12 but also pp pathway such as glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase ec 1 1 1 49 or 1 1 1 363 6 phosphogluconolactonase ec 3 1 1 31 and phosphogluconate dehydratase ec 4 2 1 12 were all significantly down regulated in the presence of tbbpa in this study wang et al 2010 apparently the down regulation of genes encoding key enzymes involving glucose metabolism was responsible for the decreased utilization of glucose fig 7a when the denitrifiers were exposed to 0 75 mg l tbbpa as shown in fig 7c these above down regulated genes either controlled the upstream of glucose metabolism e g ec 5 3 1 9 ec 1 1 1 49 or 1 1 1 363 ec 3 1 1 31 or directly regulated the nadh generation e g ec 1 2 4 1 or 2 3 1 12 which was one of the underlying reasons for the decrease of nadh concentration caused by tbbpa the tca cycle is known as the second phase of glucose metabolism which is another important source for nadh production in p denitrificans berks et al 1995 during the reactions of the tca cycle 3 mol of nad nadp are reduced to nadh or nadph by oxidizing 1 mol of acetyl coa mayes et al 2003 moreover it is well known that the tca cycle coupled with an important bypass named the glyoxylate cycle fig 7c and s4 wang et al 2010 during this bypass isocitrate is directly converted into glyoxylate and succinate instead of α ketoglutarate by isocitrate lyase subsequently with the catalysis of malate synthase glyoxylate then combined with acetyl coa to generate malate in the current study compared with the control it is interesting to find that the gene expression of key enzymes involved in glyoxylate bypass such as isocitrate lyase ec 4 1 3 1 and malate synthase ec 2 3 3 9 were remarkably up regulated in p denitrificans with exposure to 0 75 mg l tbbpa however the gene expression s variation of key enzymes involving conventional tca cycle was negligible suggesting that the presence of tbbpa promoted the glyoxylate bypass rather than the conventional tca cycle during glucose metabolism in p denitrificans as shown in fig 7c it is notable that the amount of nadh or nadph generated in the glyoxylate cycle was much less than that in the tca cycle mayes et al 2003 wang et al 2010 therefore serving as an intracellular metabolism disruptor tbbpa may regulate the metabolic flux of glucose via inhibiting emp and pp pathways and stimulating the glyoxylate bypass to decrease the generation of nadh in p denitrificans fig 6 3 3 3 effect of tbbpa on electron transport and consumption of p denitrificans during denitrification as shown in fig 8 a the nadh generated from carbon metabolism is oxidized and electrons are transferred via electron transfer chain mainly consisting of fmn iron sulfur clusters quinone pool and cyt c then consumed by nox reductases nar nir nor and nos berks et al 1995 chen et al 2013 after identifying by rna seq the degs were analyzed with the help of go and ncbi database with relevant results presented in fig 8 and table s1 si as shown in tables s1 and 133 degs involved in electron transport and consumption were identified the amount of up regulated genes 90 genes were observed to be significantly more than the down regulated ones 43 genes in which 11 significantly expressed genes were all up regulated seeing in table s1 and fig 8b specifically genes of pden 1119 and pden 4789 were identified to respectively encode nadh ubiquinone oxidoreductase and nadph dependent fmn reductase both of which played important roles in electrons transduction from nadh to quinone pool chen et al 2013 friedrich et al 2016 morever five significantly up regulated genes were identified to encode cyt c pden 2544 pden 0893 pden 4700 and pden 0021 and cyt b pden 3286 which were all reported as the electron carriers to transfer electrons from quinone pool to reductases of nir nor or nos miyata et al 1969 perin et al 1988 in addition seventeen genes encoding key denitrification enzymes nar nir nor and nos were detected in this study but there was only one up regulated gene pden 4216 encoding nitrous oxide maturation protein nosy was expressed significantly table s1 and fig s5 all of these data indicate that the presence of tbbpa might not inhibit but accelerate the electron transport and consumption processes in p denitrificans obviously the positive responses of electron transport and consumption to tbbpa fig 8 were not perfectly consistent with the actual denitrification performance fig 1 it is well known that the ultimate profiles of electron transport and consumption are largely dependent on the upstream production of electron donor which is generated from carbon substrate metabolism wan et al 2018 however in the current study the production of nadh significantly decreased with the increase of tbbpa via inhibiting the pathways of emp and pp and promoting glyoxylate bypass the decreasing of nadh directly suppressed the activity of key denitrifying enzymes fig s6 thus it can be concluded that the inhibitory effect of tbbpa on nadh production via regulating intracellular carbon metabolism was the critical cause for the negative denitrifying performance of the individual denitrifier even the electron transport and consumption system might be activated by tbbpa 4 conclusion as seen from this study via regulating the gene expression of key enzymes involved in carbon metabolism tbbpa inhibited the metabolism pathways of emp and pp and promoted the glyoxylate bypass which decreased the generation of intracellular nadh that served as the primarily electron donors for denitrification on one hand the decrease of nadh caused by tbbpa directly limited the denitrifying capability of individual denitrifiers on the other hand insufficient electron donor nadh intensified the electron competition between key denitrifying enzymes nar nir nor and nos leading to the accumulation of denitrifying intermediates no2 n no and n2o the accumulation of denitrifying intermediates enhanced intracellular rns generation which further induced the decrease of bacterial population via suppressing proliferation and increasing apoptosis of the denitrifiers therefore both the decrease of the denitrifying capability of denitrifiers and bacterial population finally led to the inhibitory effect of tbbpa on denitrification acting not only as an endocrine disruptor tbbpa also disrupted intracellular carbon metabolism pathway in denitrifiers these influences warrant more attention
