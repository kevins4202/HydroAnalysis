21585,flow around a pile cap of bridge is three dimensional and complicated when the influence of pile group and bridge pier is ignored the current forces on the pile cap are significantly affected by aspect ratio ar free surface and free end experiments were conducted to investigate the drag force transverse force vertical force and flow field of a square cylinder with ar ranging from 0 033 to 1 and re ranging from 5 4 10 4 to 23 1 10 4 visualization of the flow field shows that two recirculation zones generate below and behind the square cylinder respectively the interaction of spanwise vortices generated from both sides of the square cylinder is attenuated by the free end effect for the case with ar 0330 when r e 15 1 10 4 23 1 10 4 the free surface deforms severely and air is sucked into the free end to form an air cavity then the air cavity expands breaks up into smaller bubbles and escapes away from the free end the changing rules of the force coefficients of the cases with ar smaller than 0 167 are different from that with ar larger than 0 167 keywords experiment square cylinder current force free surface free end visualization 1 introduction in order to meet the navigation requirements of large ships long span bridges with substructures composed of pile group pile cap and piers are ordinarily designed to cross straits gulfs or rivers the substructures may suffer current force wave force or the joint action of them due to harsh environment these forces are the main loads on the substructures and deserve thorough investigations the composite substructure has huge volume and the flow field around is extremely complicated because of the interaction between the piles and the interaction between the pile group pile cap and piers therefore the water forces on the components of the composite substructure i e pile group pile cape and piers are not only large in amplitude but also influenced by the neighboring components essentially flow around the above composite substructure is a flow around blunt bodies due to the various configurations of pile foundation and different cross section shapes of both pile cap and piers it is quite difficult to study the resultant current force on the whole substructure therefore few literatures have investigated this issue many studies have been carried out to investigate current force and flow filed around an isolated component such as a pier or a group of pile without involving pile cap at the initial stage of study it is reasonable to ignore the interaction between neighboring components but only focus on an isolated component the characteristics of the current force and flow field of a square pile cap will be investigated elaborately by experimental method in this study in order to meet the requirements of ship navigation safety and bridge aesthetics pile cap is ordinarily semi submerged at a certain water depth i e at the designed normal water depth in other words the pile cap should not be completely submerged to ensure the navigation safety of ship under the designed high water level condition and it should not be exposed to air completely under the designed low water level condition for the sake of aesthetics ordinarily the cross section size of a pile cap can reach tens of meters or even around 100 m and its thickness ranges from several meters to 10 m the water depth at the bridge site changes from several meters to dozens of meters and the current velocity ranges from 1 3 m s based on the above data the flow around a pile cap has the following characteristics 1 the aspect ratio ar is small ar h d h and d are respectively the immersed depth and the cross section size of a pile cap i e ar 0 0 5 2 the influence of free surface cannot be ignored 3 the influence of free end the bottom of the pile cap cannot be ignored 4 reynolds number r e is extremely large and the wake is highly turbulent the above four characteristics make the flow around a pile cap significantly different from that of a cylinder with larger aspect ratio which has been widely concerned in marine engineering as the studies on pile cap are rare therefore the studies on the circular or square cylinders with large aspect ratios will be reviewed aiming to enlighten the study on the pile cap square or rectangular cylinders are wildly used in real practice in many fields such as in architectural engineering hydraulic engineering bridge engineering and marine engineering etc in these fields the cylinders can be assumed to be infinitely long and the influence of free surface and free end can be ignored the drag force coefficient vortex shedding frequency and characteristics of wake are the most concerned objects when studying flow around these cylinders okajima 1982 and knisely 1990 conducted experiments to investigate the vortex shedding frequency of a rectangular cylinder norberg 1993 studied the force characteristics and wake frequency of a square cylinder by experiment other similar experimental studies can be referred to lyn and rodi 1994 saha et al 2000 luo et al 2003 luo et al 2007 and similar numerical studies can be found in sharma and eswaran 2004 kim et al 2004 sohankar 2006 yoon et al 2010 bruno et al 2010 minguez et al 2011 trias et al 2015 jiang et al 2018 bai and alam 2018 as to the square cylinders with free end several experimental studies and numerical simulations have been conducted to investigate the force characteristics and flow field wang et al 2004 investigated the wake structure of square cylinders with different aspect ratios ar 3 5 7 at re 9300 in a low speed wind tunnel the experiment results show that the wake structure is dependent on aspect ratio when the aspect ratio is reduced to 3 the spanwise vortex shedding is attenuated and the base and tip vortices are dominant in addition the vortex shedding modes for square cylinders with different aspect ratios are also proposed in this study the numerical study by saha 2013 shows that the instantaneous and average flow field are significantly influenced by aspect ratio and the drag coefficient increases with the increasing aspect ratio the study by mcclean and sumner 2014 shows that with the increase of aspect ratio i e from ar 3 to ar 11 the drag coefficient and strouhal number approach to the values of an infinite square cylinder recently si et al 2019 conducted an experiment to study the frequency characteristics of the wake of a square cylinder with ar 5 at re 27000 the results show that the fluctuation of pressure on the free end is dominated by low frequency component which is about 1 10 of the shedding frequency of spanwise vortex and is in phase throughout the cylinder the above numerical and experimental studies demonstrate that the presence of free end decreases the drag coefficient and strouhal number as compared to that of infinite square cylinder and the flow structures are significantly influenced by aspect ratio the influence of free surface on square or rectangular cylinder receives less attention malavasi and guadagnini 2007 investigated the influence of free surface on hydrodynamic force of a horizontally placed rectangular cylinder the study shows that asymmetric conditions confined by free surface and channel boundary significantly affect the lift coefficient of cylinder drag coefficient and vortex shedding frequency are influenced obviously by the relative distance between the bottom surface of channel and the bottom of cylinder qi et al 2014 investigated the blockage effect on the hydrodynamic force of a square cylinder piercing free surface results show that drag coefficient is significantly affected by block ratio however the flow around a surface piercing circular cylinder receives more concerns than square cylinders inoue et al 1993 conducted a towing tank experiment to investigate the effect of free surface on a circular cylinder at fr 0 8 re 2700 and at fr 1 re 29000 note that f r u g d in which u d and g are respectively the free stream velocity the diameter of cylinder and the gravitational acceleration results show that periodic vortex shedding can be observed in deep flow region while it is not obvious near free surface chaplin and teigen 2003 carried out an experimental study on a free surface piercing circular cylinder with constant ratio of reynolds number to froude number re fr 2 79 10 5 results show that the total resistance coefficient reaches a maximum value at fr 1 kawamura et al 2002 investigated the wave wake interaction of a surface piercing circular cylinder using large eddy simulation les based on a smagorinsky sub grid ssg model at re 27000 with three different froude numbers fr 0 2 0 5 0 8 results show that with the decrease of fr the deformation of free surface decreases and the value of drag coefficient approaches to an infinite cylinder yu et al 2008 used les based on a smagorinsky sgs model and a vof method to investigate the flow around an interface piercing cylinder at different reynolds numbers up to r e 1 1 10 5 and different froude nubmers up to fr 3 results show that organized vortex shedding is attenuated near free surface in which low vorticity and low frequency of vortices are identified and the drag coefficient is below 1 2 similar numerical simulations can refer to suh et al 2011 kawamura et al 2002 yu et al 2008 koo et al 2014 xiao et al 2017 the above studies demonstrate that the vortex shedding is suppressed by free surface and drag coefficient of surface piercing circular cylinder is obviously smaller than that of an infinite cylinder at the same range of re the simultaneous presence of free surface and free end will have more complicated influence on the flow around a cylinder not only reynolds number froude number and aspect ratio are the key parameters affecting the flow field but also turbulent intensity profile of incoming flow and characteristic of boundary layer will also have effects on the flow around the cylinder to the best of our knowledge there are extremely less studies on square cylinder than on circular cylinder when taking both free surface and free end into consideration here the literatures on circular cylinder piercing free surface and with free end will be reviewed gonçalves et al 2015 carried out experiments of flow around a circular cylinder piercing free surface and with free end the aspect ratio and reynolds number respectively range from 0 1 to 2 and 1 10 4 to 5 10 4 froude number fr ranges from 0 072 to 0 361 and the ratio of reynolds number to froude number is r e f r 1 38 10 5 the results show that except the smallest aspect ratio ar 0 1 drag coefficient and strouhal number generally increase with aspect ratio interestingly there is an unexpected increase in drag coefficient when the aspect ratio changes from ar 0 2 to ar 0 1 in addition to the measurement of hydrodynamic force piv visualization experiments were carried out for ar 0 3 0 5 1 in the study the visualization results show that there are two main recirculation regions one behind the cylinder and another right below the free end however the visualization of smaller aspect ratios ar 0 1 0 2 are not conducted to investigate why the drag coefficients between these two aspect ratios are so distinct because the distinct difference in drag force is believed to be induced by the difference in flow field based on the work of gonçalves et al 2015 benitz et al 2016 investigated the flow around a circular cylinder with larger aspect ratios ar 1 19 the reynolds number is re 2900 and froude number is equal to 0 65 the main findings include that drag coefficient increases with ar free surface is dominant when ar is less than 3 and karman vortex shedding is suppressed similar experiments conducted by fukuoka et al 2016 discussed in detail the influence of reynolds number aspect ratio and froude number the results show that the root mean square coefficients of streamwise and transverse forces decrease with the increase of reynolds number froude number and aspect ratio and drag coefficient increases with the increase of froude number and aspect ratio these conclusions are in agreement with gonçalves et al 2015 recently yang et al 2019 studied the characteristics of current forces on a circular cylinder under the combined effects of free surface free end and bottom boundary condition the results show that drag coefficient is significantly influenced by ar and the root mean square coefficient of transverse force as well as the karman vortex sheddin frequency change suddenly at the instant when the cylinder touches down the flume bed in general the flow field around the pile cap is influenced by both free surface and free end few studies have concerned with this complicated flow phenomenon the aim of the present work is to study the characteristics of current forces and flow structure of a square pile cap with very low aspect ratios at different reynolds numbers the pile group and bridge pier are ignored here for simplification therefore the pile cap is simplified as a square cylinder piercing free surface and with a free end in this study to represent similar structure components in ocean engineering bridge engineering and hydraulic engineering etc 2 experiment setup in real practice the cross section size of pile cap can reach dozens of meters or even 100 m and the current velocity at bridge site can reach 1 3 m s or could be larger than 10 m s during flood period as a representative a square pile cap with the side length 50 m and the maximum velocity 10 m s at the bridge site during flood season is taken as the prototype a reasonable scale ratio will be employed to scale down the prototype pile cap in our physical experiment block ratio defined as the ratio of the cylinder diameter to the width of channel significantly affects the current forces on structure at present no current force correction method is available for semi submerged square cylinder subjected to different block ratios the critical block ratio of 0 2 is suggested by griffith et al 2011 for circular cylinders in order to minimize the block effect in our experiment a block ratio of 0 15 was chosen experiments were carried out in the water flume in the deep water long span bridge laboratory in southwest jiaotong university in china the water flume is 60 m in length 2 m in width and 2 m in depth the side length of the square pile cap model i e square cylinder can be estimated as d 0 15 2 m 0 3 m therefore the length scale ratio is λ l 0 3 50 1 167 and correspondingly the velocity ratio is λ u λ l 1 167 i e the maximum velocity is u m a x 10 167 0 77 m s in the experiment the minimum velocity was set as 0 18 m s because the even lower velocity and the resulting current force on square cylinder cannot be measured precisely the model of pile cap is made of acrylic and with side length d 0 3 m height h 0 34 m the model is fixed in the middle of testing zone of the flume where is about 30 m away from the water inlet as shown in fig 1 the water depth remains constant as 1 m the velocity ranges from 0 18 to 0 77 m s and the turbulent intensity is less than 6 correspondingly reynolds number changes from 5 4 10 4 t o 23 1 10 4 which are in subcritical region froude number varies from 0 105 to 0 45 which indicates a subcritical flow the ratio of re to fr is equal to 5 1 10 5 the aspect ratio ranges from 0 033 to 1 0 a six degree of freedom load cell ati gamma si 32 2 5 the resolution is 1 160 n and the measuring range is 32 n the sampling frequency was set as 50 hz in the experiment was used to measure the current force an acoustic doppler velocimeter adv the resolution is 0 5 mm s and the measuring range is 0 4 m s the sampling frequency was set as 50 hz in the experiment was used to measure the incoming flow velocity two wave probes were placed 0 01 m respectively upstream and downstream of the model to measure the elevation of water level the advanced piv particle image velocimetry equipment for visualization is not available therefore the red ink was ejected to the flow to visualize the basic flow structures the simple visualization equipment consists of an injector with capacity 300 ml3 and a needle tubing with a soft tube of 2 m long connecting the injector detailed experimental parameters are listed in table 1 in which the side length d remains unchangeable while the aspect ratio ranges from 0 033 to 1 0 and the in coming velocity ranges from 0 18 to 0 77 m s namely altogether 100 cases were conducted in the experiment in order to characterize the velocity distribution along the water depth z direction at the test location velocities at different water depth were measured under the two different incoming velocities u 1 and u 2 which are shown in fig 2 a then the velocities along the water depth were nondimensionalized by their own mean velocity u and are shown in fig 2 b the results show that the velocity distributions along the water depth are relatively uniform at the two different incoming velocities the relative boundary thickness δ h 1 is about 0 25 δ is the boundary thickness and h 1 is the water depth the maximum immersed depth of square cylinder is 0 3 m in the present experiment namely the square cylinder locates at the depth ranges from z 0 7 1 0 m where is relatively far from the boundary layer hence the velocity distribution in this range is uniform therefore the influence of the boundary layer or bottom shear flow is not considered in this study 3 analysis of the experimental results as representatives the time histories of drag force f x t transverse force f y t and vertical force f z t of the case with ar 1 h 0 3 m and r e 9 4 10 4 u 0 313 m s are demonstrated in fig 3 note that the gravity and the buoyancy of the cylinder were zeroed out in still water before recording the experimental data therefore the vertical force f z t measured by the load cell does not contain the gravity and the buoyancy of the cylinder it only reflects the change of vertical force in flowing water relative to that in still water approximately periodic fluctuations with periods of 10 s and 20 s can be observed in f y t and f z t respectively it is believed that the fluctuations in the current forces are induced by the fluctuations of the incoming flow velocity the positive value of f z t indicates that the pressure on the bottom of the square cylinder is smaller than that in still water implying that the actual buoyancy value in flowing water is less than that in still water drag coefficient c d root mean square coefficient of drag force c drms root mean square coefficient of transverse force c lrms and root mean square coefficient of vertical force c zrms are respectively defined as 1 c d 2 f x ρ a u 2 2 c d r m s 2 f x t f x 2 1 2 ρ a u 2 3 c l r m s 2 f y t f y 2 1 2 ρ a u 2 4 c z r m s 2 f z t f z 2 1 2 ρ d 2 u 2 in which f x f y and f y are the mean values of f x t f y t and f z t respectively a is the submerged area of upstream surface of the square cylinder in still water and d is the side length ρ is the density of water u is the incoming velocity 3 1 flow structures flow around a surface mounted finite square cylinder has already been investigated extensively several flow models for the flow around a square cylinder have been presented in the literatures e g wang et al 2004 lim et al 2009 dousset and pothérat 2010 saha 2013 and mcclean and sumner 2014 summarized the basic flow structures around the square cylinder as depicted in fig 4 the flow structures include separation from the leading edge and separation from the leading corners formation of recirculation on the free end two sets of streamwise counter rotating vortex pairs generating within the wake one near the free end the tip vortices and the other near the ground plane the base vortices horseshoes vortex at the prism wall junction karman vortex downwash flow and upwash flow except the flow structures near the ground plane i e base vortex and horseshoe vortex it is believed that flow structures of the free surface piercing square cylinder with free end are similar to that of surface mounted finite square cylinder a simple visualization method was used to confirm the main components of the flow structures in the following paragraphs the flow field around the free end of the case with ar 1 at r e 5 4 10 4 is visualized by red dye and shown in fig 5 the injection nozzle is located on the free end surface and pointing downstream the red dye does not flow downstream it reverses its direction flowing upstream along the free end surface and then flows downward and downstream behind the flow separation point therefore an obvious mean recirculation zone rotating clockwise is formed under the free end the mean recirculation zone extends into the near wake region and a large recirculation is formed behind the square cylinder due to the upwash flow the free shear layer which separates the recirculation zone and free shear flow is obviously observed these flow structures are in agreement with that of mcclean and sumner 2014 although the tip vortex structures are unable to be visualized by the present method it can be deduced that the tip vortex structures should exist in the near wake in order to observe the spanwise vortex shedding structure the needle tubing was installed vertically on the upstream surface of the cylinder with the injector pointing to the leading corner in detail the injector was placed at the half immersed depth of the cylinder as shown in fig 6 the incident flow separates from the sharp corner edge where small vortices can be observed near the corner during the experiment due to the continuous accumulation of vorticity large vortex is formed and sheds from the sharp corner edge intermittently wang et al 2004 showed that when the aspect ratio is reduced to 3 the spanwise vortex shedding is attenuated and the base and tip vortices are dominant different from the alternate shedding of karman vortex the spanwise vortex at each sharp corner edge sheds independently and intermittently and fans out downstream it is believed that the recirculation zone behind the cylinder hinders the interaction between the spanwise vortices of the both sides unlike the surface mounted square cylinders the flow around the free surface piercing square cylinder has special flow structures near the free surface due to the gravity and surface tension free surface deforms significantly when water flows around a surface piercing cylinder the deformation of free surface around the square cylinder with ar 0 167 at r e 23 1 10 4 is shown in fig 7 the yellow solid curve is the intersection line between the free surface and the side surface of the square cylinder the flow is blocked when the incoming flow approaches to the upstream surface then part of the kinetic energy of water is converted to gravitational potential energy namely water run up occurs on the upstream surface the maximum run up occurs at the middle of the upstream surface because of instability of run up water the run up height fluctuates periodically it can be observed in fig 7 a that the free surface in front of the upstream surface is rough and ripples it could be deduced that the strong three dimensional turbulent structure is formed inside the run up water sarpkaya 1996 the incident flow separates at the leading corner and the separated flow outside the leading corner is accelerated which makes the free surface on the side surfaces deform severely namely the lowest location of the yellow solid curve named the run down here as shown in fig 7 a the run down water which has a relatively large velocity is blocked by the slowly flowing water downstream then the hydraulic jump occurs because part of the kinetic energy of the run down water is converted to the gravitational potential energy and simultaneously part of the kinetic energy of run down water is dissipated by turbulence the yellow dashed line distinctly distinguishes the smooth free surface and the rough free surface and kelvin waves can be observed near the yellow dashed line the rough free surface indicates intensive turbulence and vortices beneath the free surface sarpkaya 1996 except the case with ar 0 033 the other cases have similar free surface deformations around the pile cap model which are omitted here for brevity based on the visualization and experimental data of this study a general flow mode is proposed for the free surface piercing square cylinder with free end as shown in fig 8 compared with the flow structures of the surface mounted square cylinder as shown in fig 4 the horseshoe vortex and the base vortex structures are not included because of the absence of the bottom wall boundary however some new characteristics appear due to the effect of the free surface i e the run up in front of the square cylinder the run down behind the leading corners the local hydraulic jumps and the kelvin waves on the free surface at the both sides the flow structures will significantly affect the hydrodynamic forces on the square cylinder which will be discussed elaborately in the following sections note that the flow structures are severely influenced by the aspect ratio therefore the flow structures of the smaller aspect ratio case i e ar 0 033 is chosen as a representative and will be discussed in detail in the following paragraphs it is found that in the cases with ar 0 033 at 15 1 10 4 r e 23 1 10 4 air will be involved under the free end which makes the flow structures completely different from that of the other cases as an example the evolution process of the flow structures around the free end for the square cylinder with ar 0 033 at r e 23 1 10 4 will be analyzed in one period at the beginning air is sucked into the free end as shown in fig 9 a then an air cavity is formed and attached to the free end as shown in fig 9 b the air cavity expands downward and becomes more flatter and larger as shown in fig 9 c then the air breaks up into several smaller air bubbles as shown in fig 9 d at last these small bubbles are discharged from the free end surface as shown in fig 9 e the development of air bubbles under the free end will also influence the deformation of free surface around the square cylinder which will be described in detail in the next section schematic diagrams of the flow around the free end are shown in fig 10 in which the red solid curve represents the boundary between water and air and the dotted line is the still water level t is the period of air development under the free end at the initial stage i e t 0 the air entrances are formed at the bottom of the two side surfaces and a small amount of air is sucked in as shown in fig 10 a the air suction is fundamentally induced by two reasons 1 free surface level is lower than the square cylinder free end 2 lower pressure area caused by the recirculation zone below the free end however the two air entrances locating at the bottoms of the left and right side surfaces do not connect with each other to form an air passage as shown in fig 10 a at this stage the recirculation zone is composed of water and air both rotating clockwise in the second stage i e t t 4 more air is sucked in and an air passage is formed near the leading edge of the free end namely an air cavity is formed as shown in fig 10 b the flow separated from the leading edge of the free end flows around the curved surface of the air cavity and then reattaches to the free end surface in other words the air cavity is entrapped between the separation point and the reattachment point as shown in fig 10 b the flow below the free end is accelerated because the flow section is contracted by both the square cylinder and the air bubble attached on the free end therefore a hydraulic jump generates behind the cylinder when the accelerated flow comes out from the free end surface which slightly increases the free surface level right behind the cylinder as shown in fig 10 b also severe free surface deformation caused by the hydraulic jumps on left and right sides of the cylinder are observed as shown in fig 10 b at the third stage i e t t 2 more air is sucked into the air cavity to make the air cavity expand downward and grow larger i e the size of the air cavity is roughly close to half of the cylinder bottom length as shown in fig 10 c the deformation of free surface around the cylinder i e caused by the hydraulic jumps behind and beside the cylinder and the run up before the cylinder now are the most severe at the fourth stage i e t 3t 4 with continuous accumulation of sucked air the air entrances at the side surfaces close as shown in fig 10 d and an air bubble forms and it is attached to the free end the air bubble breaks up into several small air bubbles with different sizes and then are carried away by vortex shedding which ultimately disappear in the near wake as shown in fig 10 d the process of air discharge is a process of energy dissipation in which the deformation of free surface level decreases air involving not only changes flow field obviously but also influences current forces on the square cylinder significantly which will be explained later 3 2 free surface run up and run down the average run up and run down respectively in front of and at back of the square cylinder are shown in fig 11 note that both the run up and the run down are defined as δ z and are non dimensionalized by the side length of cylinder d positive δ z and negative δ z represent respectively run up and run down of the free surface relative to the still water level in fig 11 a the minimum aspect ratio case i e ar 0 033 indicates the variation rule of δ z is completely different from the cases with larger aspect ratios in detail the run down is small and decreases slightly when 5 4 10 4 r e 13 2 10 4 but the small run up happens when 15 1 10 4 r e 23 1 10 4 according to the analysis in section 3 2 the increase of free surface level behind the square cylinder is due to the hydraulic jump behind the square cylinder for the cases with relatively larger aspect ratios the absolute values δ z of both the run up in front of the cylinder and the run down at the back of the cylinder increase with reynolds number as shown in fig 11 a and b also the run up and run down are influenced by aspect ratio the smaller reynolds number the smaller δ z difference caused by different aspect ratios and vice versa for the cases with ar 0 8 and ar 1 the run down amplitudes are basically the same with each other and are much greater than that of other cases when the aspect ratio is smaller i e the submerged depth is smaller the incoming water is easier to flow underneath the square cylinder in other words less kinetic energy is converted to potential energy that s why under the same reynolds number i e same incoming velocity the run up of smaller ar case is smaller than that of larger ar case it can be expected that the square cylinder with infinite submerged depth should have the largest run up because the incoming water can only flow around the cylinder 3 3 drag forces the relationship between the drag coefficient c d and reynolds number for the different aspect ratio cases is shown in fig 12 c d is mainly affected by aspect ratio and secondly by reynolds number when ar is relatively larger namely 0 6 a r 1 c d is weakly affected by re c d increases slightly with re when 0 133 a r 0 2 for the cases with ar 0 067 ar 0 1 and ar 0 4 c d generally decreases slightly with re for the cases with ar 0 033 c d increases with re when r e 11 3 10 4 and decreases with re when re 11 3 10 4 in general reynolds number has different effects on c d at different aspect ratios further averaged drag coefficients c d of the square cylinder are compared with those of circular cylinder studied by yang et al 2019 gonçalves et al 2015 and fukuoka et al 2016 as shown in fig 13 in which c d is obtained by averaging the drag coefficients of the cases with the same aspect ratio but with different reynolds numbers as can be observed from fig 13 c d of the square cylinder is larger than that of the circular cylinder for the circular cylinder c d increases with ar when ar 0 2 it can be expected that when the aspect ratio continues to increase c d should be close to that of an infinite cylinder in the present work ar 0 167 is the critical value of ar i e c d decreases with ar when 0 033 a r 0 167 but increases with ar when 0 167 a r 1 the main reason why c d decreases when 0 033 a r 0 167 could be accounted for two reasons 1 the pressure difference generated by the run up in front of the cylinder and run down at the back of the cylinder takes a large proportion of the drag force 2 the basic equation defining the drag coefficient is not suitable for very low aspect ratio cylinder and the projected area i e a dh should be displaced by area of free end surface i e a d d zdravkovich et al 1998 similar variation trend was found by gonçalves et al 2015 for the circular cylinder i e c d at ar 0 2 is smaller than that of the case of the neighboring ar the root mean square coefficients of the drag force c drms varying with re are shown in fig 14 a it can be observed that c drms is almost not affected by re when 0 4 a r 1 and it firstly decreases slightly and then increases when 0 033 a r 0 4 the averaged root mean square coefficients of drag force c d r m s varying with aspect ratio are demonstrated in fig 14 b c d r m s decreases with ar this finding is in agreement with the study on the circular cylinder by fukuoka et al 2016 ar 0 25 1 5 in the present work when a r is smaller i e 0 033 a r 0 167 c d r m s is obviously larger than other aspect ratios this is mainly due to the fact that the free surface is dominant and the fluctuation of drag force is mainly caused by the fluctuation of the run up water when a r 0 167 c d r m s is almost constant i e c d r m s 0 13 here c d r m s 0 13 is smaller than c d r m s 0 18 of the infinite square cylinder obtained by luo et al 1994 3 4 transverse force the relationships between c lrms root square coefficient of the transverse force and re of the cases with different aspect ratios are demonstrated in fig 15 a it can be observed that 1 when 0 067 a r 0 2 c lrms is basically not influenced by ar but c lrms decreases slightly when r e 21 3 10 4 and increases sharply when r e 21 3 10 4 2 c lrms of the cases with 0 4 a r 1 generally decreases slightly with re 3 c lrms of the cases with a r 0 033 changes intensively i e decreases sharply from 0 27 to 0 08 then increases to 0 28 with increase of re the larger c lrms of the cases with a r 0 033 as well as its intensive changes is believed to be generated by the nonsynchronous fluctuation of free surface levels on the right and left side surfaces of the square cylinder for the cases with larger a r transverse force is mainly dominated by the spanwise vortex shedding the averaged root mean coefficients of transverse force c l r m s of the cases with different aspect ratios are compared with the results by gonçalves et al 2015 as shown in fig 15 b when 0 033 a r 0 167 c l r m s decreases with ar due to the weakening influence of the nonsynchronous fluctuation of the free surface levels on left and right side surfaces of the square cylinders when 0 167 a r 1 c l r m s increases with ar because the attenuation effect on spanwise vortex shedding by the free end decreases gradually so stronger spanwise vortex shedding happens however even the largest value of c l r m s in this study i e c l r m s 0 2 is still far smaller than that of the infinite square cylinder obtained by luo et al 1994 i e c l r m s 1 21 the study on circular cylinder by gonçalves et al 2015 shows that c l r m s decreases with ar when 0 1 a r 0 2 but it increases with ar when 0 2 a r 0 5 which agrees with variation trend of c l r m s in this study it could be observed that c l r m s of this study continues to increase but c l r m s of gonçalves et al 2015 almost keeps unchanged when a r 0 5 the object in this study is a square cylinder which has fixed separation points and the fixed separation points are not sensitive to the influence of the free end with the increase of ar the intensity of the spanwise vortex continues to increase therefore c l r m s of the square cylinder continues to increase with ar as to the studies by gonçalves et al 2015 the object is a circular cylinder which has no fixed separation point and is easily influenced by the free end with the increase of ar the spanwise vortex tends to be stronger however the free end tends to attenuate the spanwise vortex more intensively the influence of the larger submerged depth counteracts the influence of the free end and finally results in a stable c l r m s for the circular cylinder when ar 0 5 similar results can be found in the study by fukuoka et al 2016 which indicates that the c l r m s almost keeps stable when ar 0 5 3 5 vertical force the average vertical forces f z of the cases with different aspect ratios and reynolds numbers are shown in fig 16 note that the load cell was zeroed out in still water namely the gravity and buoyancy of the square cylinder are not included the value of the vertical force f z only represents the fluctuation of pressure on the free end in flowing condition relative to that in still water condition positive f z means the averaged pressure on the free end in flowing water is smaller than that in still water when ar 0 033 f z shows different variation rule when compared with that of other aspect ratios in detail f z increases with re when 5 4 10 4 r e 13 2 10 4 because the larger re means larger incoming velocity and lower pressure on the free end however f z decreases with re when 15 1 10 4 r e 23 1 10 4 because air cavity air bubble is formed when r e 15 1 10 4 just as discussed in section 3 2 and the buoyancy of air is added to the free end upwardly which makes a reduction of f z in the still water the buoyance is f s ρ g h d 2 while in the flowing water the buoyance is f f f s f z and the ratio of f f to f s is defined as β f f f s indicating the relative changing ratio of buoyance in flowing water to that in still water when ar 0 033 β shows totally different variation trend compared with that of other aspect ratios as shown in fig 17 in which for ar 0 033 β decreases with re when 5 4 10 4 r e 13 2 10 4 and increases with re when 15 1 10 4 r e 23 1 10 4 however β decreases with re for the cases with other aspect ratios essentially the variation of β with re in fig 17 is similar as the variation of f z with re in fig 16 because β is transformed from f z so the reason for the variation rule of β is omitted here for brevity it is worth noting that when 0 4 a r 1 β is obviously larger than that with smaller aspect ratios indicating that with the increases of ar the buoyancy of the square cylinder in flowing water is gradually getting close to that in still water the relationships between c zrms root square coefficient of vertical force and re of the cases with different aspect ratios are demonstrated in fig 18 a generally c zrms decreases with the increasing re the averaged root square coefficients of vertical force c z r m s the average of c zrms of the cases with the same ar but different reynolds numbers are shown in fig 18 b the fluctuation of vertical force is due to the pressure change on the free end which is caused by the vortex shedding on the free end and the fluctuation of the free surface when 0 033 a r 0 167 the effect of free surface becomes relatively weaker with the increase of ar but the intensity of vortex shedding is enhanced and gradually becomes dominant as a result c z r m s increases with ar and reaches a local maximum value when a r 0 167 also because of the increasing intensity of the vortex shedding at the free end when 0 033 a r 0 167 the spanwise vortices shedding is gradually weakened then c d r m s and c l r m s decreases with the ar just as demonstrated figs 14 b and fig 15 b respectively when 0 167 a r 1 the influence of free surface of on c z r m s is getting smaller but c z r m s still slightly increases with the increase of ar it indicates that the vortex shedding from the free end intensifies slightly with increasing ar 4 conclusions physical experiments were carried out to investigate the flow field and current force on pile cap model i e a square cylinder piercing free surface and with free end in this study reynolds number is r e 5 4 10 4 23 1 10 4 and the aspect ratio is ar 0 033 1 visualizations of the flow structures of a representative case were presented and the characteristics of drag force transverse force and vertical force were analyzed and discussed

the square cylinder the run down near the leading corners the local hydraulic jumps at the both sides and the kelvin waves are the new characteristics compared with that of a surface mounted square cylinder b when ar 0 033 air is sucked into the free end surface to form an air cavity breaking up into several smaller air bubbles later and finally discharged from the free end surface the development of the sucked air makes the free surface deform severely c for the cases with relatively larger aspect ratios the absolute values δ z of both the run up in front of the cylinder and the run down behind the cylinder increase with reynolds number d c d is mainly affected by aspect ratio and secondly by reynolds number and ar 0 167 is the critical value of aspect ratio when 0 033 a r 0

decreases with re when 5 4 10 4 r e 13 2 10 4 and increases with re when 15 1 10 4 r e 23 1 10 4 β decreases with re for the cases with other aspect ratios the results of present work are beneficial

21585,flow around a pile cap of bridge is three dimensional and complicated when the influence of pile group and bridge pier is ignored the current forces on the pile cap are significantly affected by aspect ratio ar free surface and free end experiments were conducted to investigate the drag force transverse force vertical force and flow field of a square cylinder with ar ranging from 0 033 to 1 and re ranging from 5 4 10 4 to 23 1 10 4 visualization of the flow field shows that two recirculation zones generate below and behind the square cylinder respectively the interaction of spanwise vortices generated from both sides of the square cylinder is attenuated by the free end effect for the case with ar 0330 when r e 15 1 10 4 23 1 10 4 the free surface deforms severely and air is sucked into the free end to form an air cavity then the air cavity expands breaks up into smaller bubbles and escapes away from the free end the changing rules of the force coefficients of the cases with ar smaller than 0 167 are different from that with ar larger than 0 167 keywords experiment square cylinder current force free surface free end visualization 1 introduction in order to meet the navigation requirements of large ships long span bridges with substructures composed of pile group pile cap and piers are ordinarily designed to cross straits gulfs or rivers the substructures may suffer current force wave force or the joint action of them due to harsh environment these forces are the main loads on the substructures and deserve thorough investigations the composite substructure has huge volume and the flow field around is extremely complicated because of the interaction between the piles and the interaction between the pile group pile cap and piers therefore the water forces on the components of the composite substructure i e pile group pile cape and piers are not only large in amplitude but also influenced by the neighboring components essentially flow around the above composite substructure is a flow around blunt bodies due to the various configurations of pile foundation and different cross section shapes of both pile cap and piers it is quite difficult to study the resultant current force on the whole substructure therefore few literatures have investigated this issue many studies have been carried out to investigate current force and flow filed around an isolated component such as a pier or a group of pile without involving pile cap at the initial stage of study it is reasonable to ignore the interaction between neighboring components but only focus on an isolated component the characteristics of the current force and flow field of a square pile cap will be investigated elaborately by experimental method in this study in order to meet the requirements of ship navigation safety and bridge aesthetics pile cap is ordinarily semi submerged at a certain water depth i e at the designed normal water depth in other words the pile cap should not be completely submerged to ensure the navigation safety of ship under the designed high water level condition and it should not be exposed to air completely under the designed low water level condition for the sake of aesthetics ordinarily the cross section size of a pile cap can reach tens of meters or even around 100 m and its thickness ranges from several meters to 10 m the water depth at the bridge site changes from several meters to dozens of meters and the current velocity ranges from 1 3 m s based on the above data the flow around a pile cap has the following characteristics 1 the aspect ratio ar is small ar h d h and d are respectively the immersed depth and the cross section size of a pile cap i e ar 0 0 5 2 the influence of free surface cannot be ignored 3 the influence of free end the bottom of the pile cap cannot be ignored 4 reynolds number r e is extremely large and the wake is highly turbulent the above four characteristics make the flow around a pile cap significantly different from that of a cylinder with larger aspect ratio which has been widely concerned in marine engineering as the studies on pile cap are rare therefore the studies on the circular or square cylinders with large aspect ratios will be reviewed aiming to enlighten the study on the pile cap square or rectangular cylinders are wildly used in real practice in many fields such as in architectural engineering hydraulic engineering bridge engineering and marine engineering etc in these fields the cylinders can be assumed to be infinitely long and the influence of free surface and free end can be ignored the drag force coefficient vortex shedding frequency and characteristics of wake are the most concerned objects when studying flow around these cylinders okajima 1982 and knisely 1990 conducted experiments to investigate the vortex shedding frequency of a rectangular cylinder norberg 1993 studied the force characteristics and wake frequency of a square cylinder by experiment other similar experimental studies can be referred to lyn and rodi 1994 saha et al 2000 luo et al 2003 luo et al 2007 and similar numerical studies can be found in sharma and eswaran 2004 kim et al 2004 sohankar 2006 yoon et al 2010 bruno et al 2010 minguez et al 2011 trias et al 2015 jiang et al 2018 bai and alam 2018 as to the square cylinders with free end several experimental studies and numerical simulations have been conducted to investigate the force characteristics and flow field wang et al 2004 investigated the wake structure of square cylinders with different aspect ratios ar 3 5 7 at re 9300 in a low speed wind tunnel the experiment results show that the wake structure is dependent on aspect ratio when the aspect ratio is reduced to 3 the spanwise vortex shedding is attenuated and the base and tip vortices are dominant in addition the vortex shedding modes for square cylinders with different aspect ratios are also proposed in this study the numerical study by saha 2013 shows that the instantaneous and average flow field are significantly influenced by aspect ratio and the drag coefficient increases with the increasing aspect ratio the study by mcclean and sumner 2014 shows that with the increase of aspect ratio i e from ar 3 to ar 11 the drag coefficient and strouhal number approach to the values of an infinite square cylinder recently si et al 2019 conducted an experiment to study the frequency characteristics of the wake of a square cylinder with ar 5 at re 27000 the results show that the fluctuation of pressure on the free end is dominated by low frequency component which is about 1 10 of the shedding frequency of spanwise vortex and is in phase throughout the cylinder the above numerical and experimental studies demonstrate that the presence of free end decreases the drag coefficient and strouhal number as compared to that of infinite square cylinder and the flow structures are significantly influenced by aspect ratio the influence of free surface on square or rectangular cylinder receives less attention malavasi and guadagnini 2007 investigated the influence of free surface on hydrodynamic force of a horizontally placed rectangular cylinder the study shows that asymmetric conditions confined by free surface and channel boundary significantly affect the lift coefficient of cylinder drag coefficient and vortex shedding frequency are influenced obviously by the relative distance between the bottom surface of channel and the bottom of cylinder qi et al 2014 investigated the blockage effect on the hydrodynamic force of a square cylinder piercing free surface results show that drag coefficient is significantly affected by block ratio however the flow around a surface piercing circular cylinder receives more concerns than square cylinders inoue et al 1993 conducted a towing tank experiment to investigate the effect of free surface on a circular cylinder at fr 0 8 re 2700 and at fr 1 re 29000 note that f r u g d in which u d and g are respectively the free stream velocity the diameter of cylinder and the gravitational acceleration results show that periodic vortex shedding can be observed in deep flow region while it is not obvious near free surface chaplin and teigen 2003 carried out an experimental study on a free surface piercing circular cylinder with constant ratio of reynolds number to froude number re fr 2 79 10 5 results show that the total resistance coefficient reaches a maximum value at fr 1 kawamura et al 2002 investigated the wave wake interaction of a surface piercing circular cylinder using large eddy simulation les based on a smagorinsky sub grid ssg model at re 27000 with three different froude numbers fr 0 2 0 5 0 8 results show that with the decrease of fr the deformation of free surface decreases and the value of drag coefficient approaches to an infinite cylinder yu et al 2008 used les based on a smagorinsky sgs model and a vof method to investigate the flow around an interface piercing cylinder at different reynolds numbers up to r e 1 1 10 5 and different froude nubmers up to fr 3 results show that organized vortex shedding is attenuated near free surface in which low vorticity and low frequency of vortices are identified and the drag coefficient is below 1 2 similar numerical simulations can refer to suh et al 2011 kawamura et al 2002 yu et al 2008 koo et al 2014 xiao et al 2017 the above studies demonstrate that the vortex shedding is suppressed by free surface and drag coefficient of surface piercing circular cylinder is obviously smaller than that of an infinite cylinder at the same range of re the simultaneous presence of free surface and free end will have more complicated influence on the flow around a cylinder not only reynolds number froude number and aspect ratio are the key parameters affecting the flow field but also turbulent intensity profile of incoming flow and characteristic of boundary layer will also have effects on the flow around the cylinder to the best of our knowledge there are extremely less studies on square cylinder than on circular cylinder when taking both free surface and free end into consideration here the literatures on circular cylinder piercing free surface and with free end will be reviewed gonçalves et al 2015 carried out experiments of flow around a circular cylinder piercing free surface and with free end the aspect ratio and reynolds number respectively range from 0 1 to 2 and 1 10 4 to 5 10 4 froude number fr ranges from 0 072 to 0 361 and the ratio of reynolds number to froude number is r e f r 1 38 10 5 the results show that except the smallest aspect ratio ar 0 1 drag coefficient and strouhal number generally increase with aspect ratio interestingly there is an unexpected increase in drag coefficient when the aspect ratio changes from ar 0 2 to ar 0 1 in addition to the measurement of hydrodynamic force piv visualization experiments were carried out for ar 0 3 0 5 1 in the study the visualization results show that there are two main recirculation regions one behind the cylinder and another right below the free end however the visualization of smaller aspect ratios ar 0 1 0 2 are not conducted to investigate why the drag coefficients between these two aspect ratios are so distinct because the distinct difference in drag force is believed to be induced by the difference in flow field based on the work of gonçalves et al 2015 benitz et al 2016 investigated the flow around a circular cylinder with larger aspect ratios ar 1 19 the reynolds number is re 2900 and froude number is equal to 0 65 the main findings include that drag coefficient increases with ar free surface is dominant when ar is less than 3 and karman vortex shedding is suppressed similar experiments conducted by fukuoka et al 2016 discussed in detail the influence of reynolds number aspect ratio and froude number the results show that the root mean square coefficients of streamwise and transverse forces decrease with the increase of reynolds number froude number and aspect ratio and drag coefficient increases with the increase of froude number and aspect ratio these conclusions are in agreement with gonçalves et al 2015 recently yang et al 2019 studied the characteristics of current forces on a circular cylinder under the combined effects of free surface free end and bottom boundary condition the results show that drag coefficient is significantly influenced by ar and the root mean square coefficient of transverse force as well as the karman vortex sheddin frequency change suddenly at the instant when the cylinder touches down the flume bed in general the flow field around the pile cap is influenced by both free surface and free end few studies have concerned with this complicated flow phenomenon the aim of the present work is to study the characteristics of current forces and flow structure of a square pile cap with very low aspect ratios at different reynolds numbers the pile group and bridge pier are ignored here for simplification therefore the pile cap is simplified as a square cylinder piercing free surface and with a free end in this study to represent similar structure components in ocean engineering bridge engineering and hydraulic engineering etc 2 experiment setup in real practice the cross section size of pile cap can reach dozens of meters or even 100 m and the current velocity at bridge site can reach 1 3 m s or could be larger than 10 m s during flood period as a representative a square pile cap with the side length 50 m and the maximum velocity 10 m s at the bridge site during flood season is taken as the prototype a reasonable scale ratio will be employed to scale down the prototype pile cap in our physical experiment block ratio defined as the ratio of the cylinder diameter to the width of channel significantly affects the current forces on structure at present no current force correction method is available for semi submerged square cylinder subjected to different block ratios the critical block ratio of 0 2 is suggested by griffith et al 2011 for circular cylinders in order to minimize the block effect in our experiment a block ratio of 0 15 was chosen experiments were carried out in the water flume in the deep water long span bridge laboratory in southwest jiaotong university in china the water flume is 60 m in length 2 m in width and 2 m in depth the side length of the square pile cap model i e square cylinder can be estimated as d 0 15 2 m 0 3 m therefore the length scale ratio is λ l 0 3 50 1 167 and correspondingly the velocity ratio is λ u λ l 1 167 i e the maximum velocity is u m a x 10 167 0 77 m s in the experiment the minimum velocity was set as 0 18 m s because the even lower velocity and the resulting current force on square cylinder cannot be measured precisely the model of pile cap is made of acrylic and with side length d 0 3 m height h 0 34 m the model is fixed in the middle of testing zone of the flume where is about 30 m away from the water inlet as shown in fig 1 the water depth remains constant as 1 m the velocity ranges from 0 18 to 0 77 m s and the turbulent intensity is less than 6 correspondingly reynolds number changes from 5 4 10 4 t o 23 1 10 4 which are in subcritical region froude number varies from 0 105 to 0 45 which indicates a subcritical flow the ratio of re to fr is equal to 5 1 10 5 the aspect ratio ranges from 0 033 to 1 0 a six degree of freedom load cell ati gamma si 32 2 5 the resolution is 1 160 n and the measuring range is 32 n the sampling frequency was set as 50 hz in the experiment was used to measure the current force an acoustic doppler velocimeter adv the resolution is 0 5 mm s and the measuring range is 0 4 m s the sampling frequency was set as 50 hz in the experiment was used to measure the incoming flow velocity two wave probes were placed 0 01 m respectively upstream and downstream of the model to measure the elevation of water level the advanced piv particle image velocimetry equipment for visualization is not available therefore the red ink was ejected to the flow to visualize the basic flow structures the simple visualization equipment consists of an injector with capacity 300 ml3 and a needle tubing with a soft tube of 2 m long connecting the injector detailed experimental parameters are listed in table 1 in which the side length d remains unchangeable while the aspect ratio ranges from 0 033 to 1 0 and the in coming velocity ranges from 0 18 to 0 77 m s namely altogether 100 cases were conducted in the experiment in order to characterize the velocity distribution along the water depth z direction at the test location velocities at different water depth were measured under the two different incoming velocities u 1 and u 2 which are shown in fig 2 a then the velocities along the water depth were nondimensionalized by their own mean velocity u and are shown in fig 2 b the results show that the velocity distributions along the water depth are relatively uniform at the two different incoming velocities the relative boundary thickness δ h 1 is about 0 25 δ is the boundary thickness and h 1 is the water depth the maximum immersed depth of square cylinder is 0 3 m in the present experiment namely the square cylinder locates at the depth ranges from z 0 7 1 0 m where is relatively far from the boundary layer hence the velocity distribution in this range is uniform therefore the influence of the boundary layer or bottom shear flow is not considered in this study 3 analysis of the experimental results as representatives the time histories of drag force f x t transverse force f y t and vertical force f z t of the case with ar 1 h 0 3 m and r e 9 4 10 4 u 0 313 m s are demonstrated in fig 3 note that the gravity and the buoyancy of the cylinder were zeroed out in still water before recording the experimental data therefore the vertical force f z t measured by the load cell does not contain the gravity and the buoyancy of the cylinder it only reflects the change of vertical force in flowing water relative to that in still water approximately periodic fluctuations with periods of 10 s and 20 s can be observed in f y t and f z t respectively it is believed that the fluctuations in the current forces are induced by the fluctuations of the incoming flow velocity the positive value of f z t indicates that the pressure on the bottom of the square cylinder is smaller than that in still water implying that the actual buoyancy value in flowing water is less than that in still water drag coefficient c d root mean square coefficient of drag force c drms root mean square coefficient of transverse force c lrms and root mean square coefficient of vertical force c zrms are respectively defined as 1 c d 2 f x ρ a u 2 2 c d r m s 2 f x t f x 2 1 2 ρ a u 2 3 c l r m s 2 f y t f y 2 1 2 ρ a u 2 4 c z r m s 2 f z t f z 2 1 2 ρ d 2 u 2 in which f x f y and f y are the mean values of f x t f y t and f z t respectively a is the submerged area of upstream surface of the square cylinder in still water and d is the side length ρ is the density of water u is the incoming velocity 3 1 flow structures flow around a surface mounted finite square cylinder has already been investigated extensively several flow models for the flow around a square cylinder have been presented in the literatures e g wang et al 2004 lim et al 2009 dousset and pothérat 2010 saha 2013 and mcclean and sumner 2014 summarized the basic flow structures around the square cylinder as depicted in fig 4 the flow structures include separation from the leading edge and separation from the leading corners formation of recirculation on the free end two sets of streamwise counter rotating vortex pairs generating within the wake one near the free end the tip vortices and the other near the ground plane the base vortices horseshoes vortex at the prism wall junction karman vortex downwash flow and upwash flow except the flow structures near the ground plane i e base vortex and horseshoe vortex it is believed that flow structures of the free surface piercing square cylinder with free end are similar to that of surface mounted finite square cylinder a simple visualization method was used to confirm the main components of the flow structures in the following paragraphs the flow field around the free end of the case with ar 1 at r e 5 4 10 4 is visualized by red dye and shown in fig 5 the injection nozzle is located on the free end surface and pointing downstream the red dye does not flow downstream it reverses its direction flowing upstream along the free end surface and then flows downward and downstream behind the flow separation point therefore an obvious mean recirculation zone rotating clockwise is formed under the free end the mean recirculation zone extends into the near wake region and a large recirculation is formed behind the square cylinder due to the upwash flow the free shear layer which separates the recirculation zone and free shear flow is obviously observed these flow structures are in agreement with that of mcclean and sumner 2014 although the tip vortex structures are unable to be visualized by the present method it can be deduced that the tip vortex structures should exist in the near wake in order to observe the spanwise vortex shedding structure the needle tubing was installed vertically on the upstream surface of the cylinder with the injector pointing to the leading corner in detail the injector was placed at the half immersed depth of the cylinder as shown in fig 6 the incident flow separates from the sharp corner edge where small vortices can be observed near the corner during the experiment due to the continuous accumulation of vorticity large vortex is formed and sheds from the sharp corner edge intermittently wang et al 2004 showed that when the aspect ratio is reduced to 3 the spanwise vortex shedding is attenuated and the base and tip vortices are dominant different from the alternate shedding of karman vortex the spanwise vortex at each sharp corner edge sheds independently and intermittently and fans out downstream it is believed that the recirculation zone behind the cylinder hinders the interaction between the spanwise vortices of the both sides unlike the surface mounted square cylinders the flow around the free surface piercing square cylinder has special flow structures near the free surface due to the gravity and surface tension free surface deforms significantly when water flows around a surface piercing cylinder the deformation of free surface around the square cylinder with ar 0 167 at r e 23 1 10 4 is shown in fig 7 the yellow solid curve is the intersection line between the free surface and the side surface of the square cylinder the flow is blocked when the incoming flow approaches to the upstream surface then part of the kinetic energy of water is converted to gravitational potential energy namely water run up occurs on the upstream surface the maximum run up occurs at the middle of the upstream surface because of instability of run up water the run up height fluctuates periodically it can be observed in fig 7 a that the free surface in front of the upstream surface is rough and ripples it could be deduced that the strong three dimensional turbulent structure is formed inside the run up water sarpkaya 1996 the incident flow separates at the leading corner and the separated flow outside the leading corner is accelerated which makes the free surface on the side surfaces deform severely namely the lowest location of the yellow solid curve named the run down here as shown in fig 7 a the run down water which has a relatively large velocity is blocked by the slowly flowing water downstream then the hydraulic jump occurs because part of the kinetic energy of the run down water is converted to the gravitational potential energy and simultaneously part of the kinetic energy of run down water is dissipated by turbulence the yellow dashed line distinctly distinguishes the smooth free surface and the rough free surface and kelvin waves can be observed near the yellow dashed line the rough free surface indicates intensive turbulence and vortices beneath the free surface sarpkaya 1996 except the case with ar 0 033 the other cases have similar free surface deformations around the pile cap model which are omitted here for brevity based on the visualization and experimental data of this study a general flow mode is proposed for the free surface piercing square cylinder with free end as shown in fig 8 compared with the flow structures of the surface mounted square cylinder as shown in fig 4 the horseshoe vortex and the base vortex structures are not included because of the absence of the bottom wall boundary however some new characteristics appear due to the effect of the free surface i e the run up in front of the square cylinder the run down behind the leading corners the local hydraulic jumps and the kelvin waves on the free surface at the both sides the flow structures will significantly affect the hydrodynamic forces on the square cylinder which will be discussed elaborately in the following sections note that the flow structures are severely influenced by the aspect ratio therefore the flow structures of the smaller aspect ratio case i e ar 0 033 is chosen as a representative and will be discussed in detail in the following paragraphs it is found that in the cases with ar 0 033 at 15 1 10 4 r e 23 1 10 4 air will be involved under the free end which makes the flow structures completely different from that of the other cases as an example the evolution process of the flow structures around the free end for the square cylinder with ar 0 033 at r e 23 1 10 4 will be analyzed in one period at the beginning air is sucked into the free end as shown in fig 9 a then an air cavity is formed and attached to the free end as shown in fig 9 b the air cavity expands downward and becomes more flatter and larger as shown in fig 9 c then the air breaks up into several smaller air bubbles as shown in fig 9 d at last these small bubbles are discharged from the free end surface as shown in fig 9 e the development of air bubbles under the free end will also influence the deformation of free surface around the square cylinder which will be described in detail in the next section schematic diagrams of the flow around the free end are shown in fig 10 in which the red solid curve represents the boundary between water and air and the dotted line is the still water level t is the period of air development under the free end at the initial stage i e t 0 the air entrances are formed at the bottom of the two side surfaces and a small amount of air is sucked in as shown in fig 10 a the air suction is fundamentally induced by two reasons 1 free surface level is lower than the square cylinder free end 2 lower pressure area caused by the recirculation zone below the free end however the two air entrances locating at the bottoms of the left and right side surfaces do not connect with each other to form an air passage as shown in fig 10 a at this stage the recirculation zone is composed of water and air both rotating clockwise in the second stage i e t t 4 more air is sucked in and an air passage is formed near the leading edge of the free end namely an air cavity is formed as shown in fig 10 b the flow separated from the leading edge of the free end flows around the curved surface of the air cavity and then reattaches to the free end surface in other words the air cavity is entrapped between the separation point and the reattachment point as shown in fig 10 b the flow below the free end is accelerated because the flow section is contracted by both the square cylinder and the air bubble attached on the free end therefore a hydraulic jump generates behind the cylinder when the accelerated flow comes out from the free end surface which slightly increases the free surface level right behind the cylinder as shown in fig 10 b also severe free surface deformation caused by the hydraulic jumps on left and right sides of the cylinder are observed as shown in fig 10 b at the third stage i e t t 2 more air is sucked into the air cavity to make the air cavity expand downward and grow larger i e the size of the air cavity is roughly close to half of the cylinder bottom length as shown in fig 10 c the deformation of free surface around the cylinder i e caused by the hydraulic jumps behind and beside the cylinder and the run up before the cylinder now are the most severe at the fourth stage i e t 3t 4 with continuous accumulation of sucked air the air entrances at the side surfaces close as shown in fig 10 d and an air bubble forms and it is attached to the free end the air bubble breaks up into several small air bubbles with different sizes and then are carried away by vortex shedding which ultimately disappear in the near wake as shown in fig 10 d the process of air discharge is a process of energy dissipation in which the deformation of free surface level decreases air involving not only changes flow field obviously but also influences current forces on the square cylinder significantly which will be explained later 3 2 free surface run up and run down the average run up and run down respectively in front of and at back of the square cylinder are shown in fig 11 note that both the run up and the run down are defined as δ z and are non dimensionalized by the side length of cylinder d positive δ z and negative δ z represent respectively run up and run down of the free surface relative to the still water level in fig 11 a the minimum aspect ratio case i e ar 0 033 indicates the variation rule of δ z is completely different from the cases with larger aspect ratios in detail the run down is small and decreases slightly when 5 4 10 4 r e 13 2 10 4 but the small run up happens when 15 1 10 4 r e 23 1 10 4 according to the analysis in section 3 2 the increase of free surface level behind the square cylinder is due to the hydraulic jump behind the square cylinder for the cases with relatively larger aspect ratios the absolute values δ z of both the run up in front of the cylinder and the run down at the back of the cylinder increase with reynolds number as shown in fig 11 a and b also the run up and run down are influenced by aspect ratio the smaller reynolds number the smaller δ z difference caused by different aspect ratios and vice versa for the cases with ar 0 8 and ar 1 the run down amplitudes are basically the same with each other and are much greater than that of other cases when the aspect ratio is smaller i e the submerged depth is smaller the incoming water is easier to flow underneath the square cylinder in other words less kinetic energy is converted to potential energy that s why under the same reynolds number i e same incoming velocity the run up of smaller ar case is smaller than that of larger ar case it can be expected that the square cylinder with infinite submerged depth should have the largest run up because the incoming water can only flow around the cylinder 3 3 drag forces the relationship between the drag coefficient c d and reynolds number for the different aspect ratio cases is shown in fig 12 c d is mainly affected by aspect ratio and secondly by reynolds number when ar is relatively larger namely 0 6 a r 1 c d is weakly affected by re c d increases slightly with re when 0 133 a r 0 2 for the cases with ar 0 067 ar 0 1 and ar 0 4 c d generally decreases slightly with re for the cases with ar 0 033 c d increases with re when r e 11 3 10 4 and decreases with re when re 11 3 10 4 in general reynolds number has different effects on c d at different aspect ratios further averaged drag coefficients c d of the square cylinder are compared with those of circular cylinder studied by yang et al 2019 gonçalves et al 2015 and fukuoka et al 2016 as shown in fig 13 in which c d is obtained by averaging the drag coefficients of the cases with the same aspect ratio but with different reynolds numbers as can be observed from fig 13 c d of the square cylinder is larger than that of the circular cylinder for the circular cylinder c d increases with ar when ar 0 2 it can be expected that when the aspect ratio continues to increase c d should be close to that of an infinite cylinder in the present work ar 0 167 is the critical value of ar i e c d decreases with ar when 0 033 a r 0 167 but increases with ar when 0 167 a r 1 the main reason why c d decreases when 0 033 a r 0 167 could be accounted for two reasons 1 the pressure difference generated by the run up in front of the cylinder and run down at the back of the cylinder takes a large proportion of the drag force 2 the basic equation defining the drag coefficient is not suitable for very low aspect ratio cylinder and the projected area i e a dh should be displaced by area of free end surface i e a d d zdravkovich et al 1998 similar variation trend was found by gonçalves et al 2015 for the circular cylinder i e c d at ar 0 2 is smaller than that of the case of the neighboring ar the root mean square coefficients of the drag force c drms varying with re are shown in fig 14 a it can be observed that c drms is almost not affected by re when 0 4 a r 1 and it firstly decreases slightly and then increases when 0 033 a r 0 4 the averaged root mean square coefficients of drag force c d r m s varying with aspect ratio are demonstrated in fig 14 b c d r m s decreases with ar this finding is in agreement with the study on the circular cylinder by fukuoka et al 2016 ar 0 25 1 5 in the present work when a r is smaller i e 0 033 a r 0 167 c d r m s is obviously larger than other aspect ratios this is mainly due to the fact that the free surface is dominant and the fluctuation of drag force is mainly caused by the fluctuation of the run up water when a r 0 167 c d r m s is almost constant i e c d r m s 0 13 here c d r m s 0 13 is smaller than c d r m s 0 18 of the infinite square cylinder obtained by luo et al 1994 3 4 transverse force the relationships between c lrms root square coefficient of the transverse force and re of the cases with different aspect ratios are demonstrated in fig 15 a it can be observed that 1 when 0 067 a r 0 2 c lrms is basically not influenced by ar but c lrms decreases slightly when r e 21 3 10 4 and increases sharply when r e 21 3 10 4 2 c lrms of the cases with 0 4 a r 1 generally decreases slightly with re 3 c lrms of the cases with a r 0 033 changes intensively i e decreases sharply from 0 27 to 0 08 then increases to 0 28 with increase of re the larger c lrms of the cases with a r 0 033 as well as its intensive changes is believed to be generated by the nonsynchronous fluctuation of free surface levels on the right and left side surfaces of the square cylinder for the cases with larger a r transverse force is mainly dominated by the spanwise vortex shedding the averaged root mean coefficients of transverse force c l r m s of the cases with different aspect ratios are compared with the results by gonçalves et al 2015 as shown in fig 15 b when 0 033 a r 0 167 c l r m s decreases with ar due to the weakening influence of the nonsynchronous fluctuation of the free surface levels on left and right side surfaces of the square cylinders when 0 167 a r 1 c l r m s increases with ar because the attenuation effect on spanwise vortex shedding by the free end decreases gradually so stronger spanwise vortex shedding happens however even the largest value of c l r m s in this study i e c l r m s 0 2 is still far smaller than that of the infinite square cylinder obtained by luo et al 1994 i e c l r m s 1 21 the study on circular cylinder by gonçalves et al 2015 shows that c l r m s decreases with ar when 0 1 a r 0 2 but it increases with ar when 0 2 a r 0 5 which agrees with variation trend of c l r m s in this study it could be observed that c l r m s of this study continues to increase but c l r m s of gonçalves et al 2015 almost keeps unchanged when a r 0 5 the object in this study is a square cylinder which has fixed separation points and the fixed separation points are not sensitive to the influence of the free end with the increase of ar the intensity of the spanwise vortex continues to increase therefore c l r m s of the square cylinder continues to increase with ar as to the studies by gonçalves et al 2015 the object is a circular cylinder which has no fixed separation point and is easily influenced by the free end with the increase of ar the spanwise vortex tends to be stronger however the free end tends to attenuate the spanwise vortex more intensively the influence of the larger submerged depth counteracts the influence of the free end and finally results in a stable c l r m s for the circular cylinder when ar 0 5 similar results can be found in the study by fukuoka et al 2016 which indicates that the c l r m s almost keeps stable when ar 0 5 3 5 vertical force the average vertical forces f z of the cases with different aspect ratios and reynolds numbers are shown in fig 16 note that the load cell was zeroed out in still water namely the gravity and buoyancy of the square cylinder are not included the value of the vertical force f z only represents the fluctuation of pressure on the free end in flowing condition relative to that in still water condition positive f z means the averaged pressure on the free end in flowing water is smaller than that in still water when ar 0 033 f z shows different variation rule when compared with that of other aspect ratios in detail f z increases with re when 5 4 10 4 r e 13 2 10 4 because the larger re means larger incoming velocity and lower pressure on the free end however f z decreases with re when 15 1 10 4 r e 23 1 10 4 because air cavity air bubble is formed when r e 15 1 10 4 just as discussed in section 3 2 and the buoyancy of air is added to the free end upwardly which makes a reduction of f z in the still water the buoyance is f s ρ g h d 2 while in the flowing water the buoyance is f f f s f z and the ratio of f f to f s is defined as β f f f s indicating the relative changing ratio of buoyance in flowing water to that in still water when ar 0 033 β shows totally different variation trend compared with that of other aspect ratios as shown in fig 17 in which for ar 0 033 β decreases with re when 5 4 10 4 r e 13 2 10 4 and increases with re when 15 1 10 4 r e 23 1 10 4 however β decreases with re for the cases with other aspect ratios essentially the variation of β with re in fig 17 is similar as the variation of f z with re in fig 16 because β is transformed from f z so the reason for the variation rule of β is omitted here for brevity it is worth noting that when 0 4 a r 1 β is obviously larger than that with smaller aspect ratios indicating that with the increases of ar the buoyancy of the square cylinder in flowing water is gradually getting close to that in still water the relationships between c zrms root square coefficient of vertical force and re of the cases with different aspect ratios are demonstrated in fig 18 a generally c zrms decreases with the increasing re the averaged root square coefficients of vertical force c z r m s the average of c zrms of the cases with the same ar but different reynolds numbers are shown in fig 18 b the fluctuation of vertical force is due to the pressure change on the free end which is caused by the vortex shedding on the free end and the fluctuation of the free surface when 0 033 a r 0 167 the effect of free surface becomes relatively weaker with the increase of ar but the intensity of vortex shedding is enhanced and gradually becomes dominant as a result c z r m s increases with ar and reaches a local maximum value when a r 0 167 also because of the increasing intensity of the vortex shedding at the free end when 0 033 a r 0 167 the spanwise vortices shedding is gradually weakened then c d r m s and c l r m s decreases with the ar just as demonstrated figs 14 b and fig 15 b respectively when 0 167 a r 1 the influence of free surface of on c z r m s is getting smaller but c z r m s still slightly increases with the increase of ar it indicates that the vortex shedding from the free end intensifies slightly with increasing ar 4 conclusions physical experiments were carried out to investigate the flow field and current force on pile cap model i e a square cylinder piercing free surface and with free end in this study reynolds number is r e 5 4 10 4 23 1 10 4 and the aspect ratio is ar 0 033 1 visualizations of the flow structures of a representative case were presented and the characteristics of drag force transverse force and vertical force were analyzed and discussed in detail the main conclusions are summarized as a a flow mode is proposed to depict the characteristics of flow field around a surface piercing square cylinder with free end the run up in front of the square cylinder the run down near the leading corners the local hydraulic jumps at the both sides and the kelvin waves are the new characteristics compared with that of a surface mounted square cylinder b when ar 0 033 air is sucked into the free end surface to form an air cavity breaking up into several smaller air bubbles later and finally discharged from the free end surface the development of the sucked air makes the free surface deform severely c for the cases with relatively larger aspect ratios the absolute values δ z of both the run up in front of the cylinder and the run down behind the cylinder increase with reynolds number d c d is mainly affected by aspect ratio and secondly by reynolds number and ar 0 167 is the critical value of aspect ratio when 0 033 a r 0 167 c d c d r m s and c l r m s decrease with ar but c z r m s increases with ar when 0 167 a r 1 c d c l r m s and c z r m s increases with ar but c d r m s keeps as constant 0 13 e when ar 0 033 β decreases with re when 5 4 10 4 r e 13 2 10 4 and increases with re when 15 1 10 4 r e 23 1 10 4 β decreases with re for the cases with other aspect ratios the results of present work are beneficial

21586,this paper presents numerical investigations of the flow induced vibration of an elastically mounted elliptical cylinder with different aspect ratios the cylinder is constrained to vibrate only in the cross flow direction with the major axis being perpendicular to the uniform flow the reynolds number based on the free stream velocity and the major axis width is fixed as 100 the aspect ratio ar is based on the minor axis width over the major axis width by specifying ar 0 1 0 25 0 5 0 75 and 1 with a fixed mass ratio of 10 the fluid cylinder interactions are simulated using a high order spectral hp element method to characterize the vibration responses oscillation frequencies fluctuating drag and lift coefficients lock in regimes and vorticity contours with the variation of reduced velocities a synchronization regime is found to be directly correlated with ar for the lowest ar 0 1 the elliptical cylinder response is found to be greater as much as twice than the circular cylinder response by also exhibiting an earlier onset of the lock in the lack of the cylinder afterbody has a significant effect on the lower branch response resulting in a beating phenomenon and a rapid reduction in the response with decreasing ar the effect of varying mass ratios is also investigated for low ar cases the vortex shedding modes for all the response branches are found to be 2s with wake variants a parallel vortex shedding mode is noticed in a lower ar case with a large amplitude oscillation whereas the c 2s mode is observed in a higher ar case keywords flow induced vibration fluid structure interaction spectral hp element method elliptical cylinder aspect ratio 1 introduction the flow around a cylindrical structure has attracted great attention owing to several fundamental aspects related to the fluid dynamics of practical importance in various scientific and engineering fields for the flow structure interaction the vortex induced vibration viv is encountered in several applications such as offshore structures chimney stacks transmission cables bridges and renewable energy harvesters bernitsas et al 2008 rostami and armandei 2017 various mechanisms and fundamental physics involved in viv phenomena are well documented in the review of williamson and govardhan 2004 2008 sarpkaya 2004 and bearman 1984 extensive investigations on the circular cylinder viv have been carried out and used as the basis for other cross sectional bodies undergoing fluid structure interactions different numerical and experimental studies by brooks 1960 govardhan and williamson 2000 wang 2010 bearman 2011 ji et al 2011 bao et al 2012 srinil et al 2013 wang et al 2017 srinil et al 2018 wang et al 2019 and zhu et al 2019 have contributed to the understanding of viv of circular cylinders however on breaking of the rotational symmetry the associated flow induced vibration feature is greatly altered one of the generic examples is the rectangular square cross section sen and mittal 2011 studied the free vibration of a square cylinder at a low reynolds number r e and found various fundamental variations in viv characteristics for the identical flow condition a narrow synchronization regime was observed with the maximum transverse amplitude almost half of that reported by singh and mittal 2005 for a circular cylinder zhao et al 2019b performed an experimental study on flow induced vibrations of rectangular cylinders with 2 0 ϵ 5 0 where ϵ 1 a r and a r is the aspect ratio the minor axis width over the major axis width see e g fig 1 a he observed viv and galloping behaviors for which the onset of a lock in and vibration responses were significantly altered by a change in the aspect ratio a similar experimental research work was done by zhao et al 2019a for an elliptical cylinder 0 67 ϵ 1 50 for 860 r e 8050 he reported similar lock in characteristics but the oscillation was dominated by viv without a transverse galloping on further discussing on the effect of asymmetric bodies the pioneering work by brooks 1960 showed that the d section with a flat surface facing upstream exhibited viv and galloping phenomena whereas no vibration was observed for the reversed d shape the author suggested that the latter behavior is due to the absence of afterbody for which the pressure force associated with the shed vortices could not generate lift recently zhao et al 2018 found a contrasting strong amplitude response to that of brooks 1960 and explained that such differences might be due to a difference in the considered mass ratios the effect of afterbody by varying the inclination angle nemes et al 2012 zhao et al 2014 and a role of separation point by varying the corner curvature of a square cylinder kumar et al 2009 shed some light to the radial asymmetry effect however the flow physics describing such a feature is still lacking the present study therefore aims to investigate the wake characteristics amplitude responses and hydrodynamic force coefficients by considering the flow induced vibration of elliptical cylinders in comparison with circular and square rectangular cylinders the flow characteristics behind elliptical cylinders have been relatively less explored the elliptical cylinder covers a wide range of the geometry including a circular and flat plate section when the cylinder becomes elliptical the wake characteristics or patterns are significantly altered some previous works bhattacharya and shahajhan 2016 hasheminejad et al 2017 suggested the elliptical cylinder as a potential source of power extraction paul et al 2016 studied the effects of ar angle of attack and r e on the associated drag lift forces and strouhal number of flow past a stationary elliptical cylinder in a laminar flow regime they classified seven flow regimes related to some functional relationship of fluid force parameters thompson et al 2014 studied a low r e wake of an elliptical cylinder of different ar values and determined the strouhal frequencies being verified by experimental results of radi et al 2013 johnson et al 2004 predicted a low frequency unsteadiness in the wake of an elliptical cylinder such feature was further explained by pulletikurthi et al 2019 who employed a complex demodulation technique to segregate the amplitude signal to four different regimes quasi steady linear growth transition and saturation and concluded that the transitional part of the signal results in the temporal low frequency structures in the wake in contrast to stationary elliptical cylinders research related to viv characteristics of oscillating elliptical cylinders is still lacking subject to several parameters including r e reduced velocity mass and aspect ratios and angle of inclination or attack based on the shape and orientation hasheminejad and jarrahi 2015 studied the elliptical cylinder viv with different inclination angles and found that the lock in phenomenon gradually shifts to a higher r e with increasing ar navrose et al 2014 classified elliptical cylinder viv responses into seven different branches based on the vortex shedding regimes and force response time histories leontini et al 2018 studied the effect of flow angle of attack and reported the sensitivity of the vibration to the system asymmetry even without a sharp corner different types of the vortex shedding regimes including p s and period doubling were observed the most interesting phenomenon was for the inclination angle of 90 such that the major axis is aligned perpendicular to the flow where a wide range of large amplitude oscillations were observed moreover they also explained how the circulation of the shed vortices is related to a critical mass ratio previous studies have focused on viv of elliptical cylinders at a higher ar in the present study the effects of flow separation and afterbody are investigated by varying the ratio of the in line diameter to the cross flow diameter from being a circular cylinder to a nearly flat plate parametric studies are carried out by employing a high order spectral element method to highlight fundamental viv characteristics including vibration responses hydrodynamic force coefficients lock in regimes and wake patterns additional cases are also considered to examine the mass ratio effect on viv responses for a very low ar the paper proceeds by describing the methodology and governing equations in section 2 section 3 presents simulation parameters validation and grid independence test numerical results and discussion on elliptical cylinder viv are presented in section 4 the paper ends with conclusions in section 5 2 numerical methodology to simulate an incompressible viscous fluid flow the navier stokes and continuity equations are employed which can be expressed in the inertial coordinate system x y as 1 u t u u p 1 r e 2 u 2 u 0 where u u v represents the fluid velocity in x y coordinate direction and p is the dynamic pressure r e u d ν is the reynolds number in which u is the free stream velocity ν is the kinematic viscosity and d is the characteristics length which is assumed to be 1 0 for solving the flow over an oscillating body the fluid solver requires a certain treatment for the time dependent and moving boundary condition the difficulty of the moving computational domain is eliminated by employing a boundary fitted coordinate system such a transformation maps a deforming computational domain to a non deforming or stationary one in the current study the mapping with respect to the cylinder motion is described by the following transformation x x y y y t in which y t is used to quantify the cylinder displacement obtained from the structural spring mass model the field variables of velocity and pressure are transformed as u u v v d y t d t p p in the transformed coordinate system x y the moving body effect on the flow field is therefore accounted for by adding an extra forcing term f e 0 d 2 y t d t 2 to the navier stokes equations with the non inertial reference frame transformation li et al 2002 as 3 u t u u p 1 r e 2 u f e 4 u 0 the transverse dynamic response of an elastically mounted elliptical cylinder is modelled by a mass spring damper system as 5 y 4 π ξ y f n y 4 π 2 f n 2 y 2 c l π a r m where y y and y denote the non dimensional transverse acceleration velocity and displacement normalized by d of the elliptical cylinder ξ y is the structural damping ratio and f n is the natural frequency of the elliptical cylinder with u r u f n d being the reduced velocity the mass of the cylinder per unit length m is non dimensionalized as m m m d where m d ρ f π b d 4 is the displaced fluid mass with ρ f being the fluid density c l 2 f l ρ f u 2 d and c d 2 f d ρ f u 2 d are the lift and drag coefficients in which f l and f d are the fluid forces exerted in the transverse and in line directions the instantaneous lift and drag forces acting on the cylinder are computed by integrating the pressure and viscous stresses around the cylinder circumference 6 f t p k ν u t u k d s here k is a unit vector normal to the cylinder surface the coupled fluid structure interaction is solved in the framework of nektar which is based on the spectral hp element method newman and karniadakis 1997 karniadakis and sherwin 2013 cantwell et al 2015 the 2d spatial domain discretization employs the quadrilateral spectral elements associated with the 5th order legendre basis polynomial the velocity correction scheme guermond and shen 2003 is incorporated with the second order explicit time integration rules for the temporal discretization such a high order stiffly stable splitting projection method is an effective decoupling technique which leads to the second order accuracy for the pressure and velocity fields the dynamic response of the transversely oscillating cylinder is solved by the newmark β method the fluid forces are obtained from the flow field whereas the cylinder displacement is obtained from the equation of motion which in turn modifies the flow field and hydrodynamic forces such a fluid structure interaction is accounted for by using a loose coupling strategy for which the flow field and the cylinder motion are iteratively solved at a given time step 3 problem description the current investigation is focused on a systematic illustration of flow dynamics and response characteristics of viv of an elliptical cylinder whose the major axis is aligned perpendicular to the uniform flow stream as shown in fig 1 b five representative values of the aspect ratio a r b d defined by the ratio of the minor axis width b to the major axis width d are considered from 0 1 to 1 0 the considered aspect ratios are the same as those investigated by thompson et al 2014 who studied the wake behind a stationary elliptical cylinder however in this study the elastically mounted elliptical cylinder undergoes the transverse only viv simulations are carried out for a wide range of reduced velocities u r 2 0 11 0 based on the cylinder natural frequency table 1 reports the mass of the cylinder per unit length m for different a r for a fixed mass ratio m of 10 0 the effect of varying m on elliptical cylinder viv is also studied for low ar cases khalak and williamson 1997 stated that for a low m ξ system there is no a considerable effect on viv response a series of experiments of soti et al 2018 further showed insignificant alteration of viv characteristics and maximum responses for different ξ therefore numerical simulations are herein carried out with a negligible effect ξ y 0 for all ar the reynolds number based on the upstream flow velocity and d is fixed as 100 the problem setup is outlined in fig 2 the c type computational domain with an origin fixed at the center of the cylinder where 20d is the radius of upstream boundary whereas the downstream wake length is extended to 80d allowing to capture the wake characteristics prasanth et al 2006 and prasanth and mittal 2008 studied the effect of blockage ratio for similar simulation parameters and concluded that the blockage ratio of being less than or equal to 2 5 eliminates the effect of lateral boundaries on simulation results this supports the computational domain of blockage ratio 2 5 considered therein the dirichlet boundary condition corresponding to the free stream velocity is specified as u v u 0 at the inlet boundary while the no slip boundary condition u v 0 y is prescribed at the cylinder the far flow boundary condition u v u 0 is considered at the lateral boundaries instability may be experienced because of energetic vortices in the outlet region to account for such unsteadiness the high order outflow boundary condition see dong et al 2014 for details is assumed at the outlet 3 1 validation to validate accuracy of the computational approach viv of an elastically mounted circular cylinder is considered fig 3 a presents a comparison of transverse oscillations with those of ahn and kallinderis 2006 and borazjani et al 2008 the flow considered here is at re 150 for the cylinder with m 2 0 and ξ y 0 in fig 3 b the maximum responses in the transverse direction are compared with those of zhao et al 2013 the results verify the suitability of the current numerical approach additionally the hydrodynamic lift and frequency characteristics are also compared with results of zhao et al 2013 as shown in fig 4 a and b respectively showing a good agreement time histories of the lift force and the displacement show a quasi periodic behavior in the initial branch and a periodic behavior in the lower branch in accordance with singh and mittal 2005 see fig 5 all these results confirm accuracy and applicability of the current simulation method to further validate the reliability in viv of elliptical cylinder navrose et al 2014 is taken as a reference navrose et al 2014 investigated the free vibration of elliptical cylinder with 60 r e 140 for a wide range of ars for validation purpose some specific ar with a reduced velocity corresponding to re 100 is chosen we can observe from table 2 that the maximum oscillation amplitudes in different ar 1 ϵ cases are in good agreement with the present simulation results 3 2 convergence test the spectral spatial convergence is observed in the spectral hp element method as the order of the polynomial is increased in the mesh resolution to ensure the independence of numerical results and the computational efficiency the polynomial order p 4 6 is considered for three illustrative cases ar 0 1 and ar 0 5 at u r 4 5 and ar 1 0 at u r 5 0 corresponding to the high amplitude oscillations the non dimensional time step δ t 0 002 is used in the computations the transverse displacements and root mean squared rms values of the fluid forcing components of such three elliptical cylinders are tabulated in tables 3 5 respectively the percentage deviation of the fluid dynamic components with the increase in the polynomial order of the spectral elements are indicated inside the brackets it can be concluded that the simulations for case ii provide the acceptable accuracy for all considered cases by considering case ii in the following the final mesh would consist of 2644 spectral elements with the 5th order legendre basis polynomial as exemplified in fig 6 4 numerical results and discussion 4 1 amplitude responses fig 7 a shows rms values of normalized transverse amplitudes with varying u r for different ar cases correspondingly fig 7 b presents mean values of the top 10 of the normalized peak amplitudes zhao et al 2014 nemes et al 2012 zhao et al 2019a the normalization is made with respect to the major axis width of the cylinder it is observed that the elliptical cylinder viv exhibits different response behaviors as a function of ar for a circular cylinder with ar 1 0 the vibration response shows a typical abrupt increase of the initial branch amplitude attaining a peak amplitude of oscillation of nearly 0 6d and continuing the lower branch this is consistent with that observed by singh and mittal 2005 for the same r e the response behavior for ar 0 75 is found to be similar to that of a circular cylinder because a point of separation is not relatively fixed the corner is wider and more rounded enabling a similar vortex formation between elliptical and circular cylinders navrose et al 2014 obtained similar results in a higher ar case in contrast for the lowest ar 0 1 the response amplitude increases significantly in the range of u r 2 5 5 0 attaining a peak of nearly 1 22d being considerably greater than that for a circular cylinder at u r 5 0 it is also found that the amplitude response has a direct correlation with the decreasing ar the drastic increase in the amplitude response takes place when the afterbody is reduced by lowering ar this is in qualitative agreement with experimental observations by zhao et al 2019b for rectangular cylinders and zhao et al 2019a for elliptical cylinders from fig 7 the u r ranges for initial and lower branches are also found to be a function of ar the cylinders with ar 1 0 and 0 75 exhibit a narrow initial branch range being broadened with decreasing ar nevertheless the maximum response gradually increases as ar is decreased the onset of the initial branch in the lower ar case is noted to be earlier than that in higher ar cases because of the pre synchronization as discussed later on in section 4 3 for the lower branch the onset of this range is characterized by a beating phenomenon at a certain range of u r which may be noticed by the variation in a 10 versus y r m s the vibration response attenuates to a sudden lower value with decreasing ar such behavior is pronounced for ar 0 1 0 5 for which a relatively sharp decreased response in the lower branch is seen in fig 7 a owing to an earlier desynchronization and the associated phase difference shown in section 4 3 this feature provides a strong evidence of the afterbody effect 4 2 hydrodynamic forces variations of mean and rms values of the total hydrodynamic lift and drag force coefficients are illustrated in figs 8 and 9 respectively it is observed that the lift forces are significant at the onset of the lock in region increasing abruptly in the first halves of the synchronization this is followed by a downtrend to a very low value before a jump of the lift force to a value associated with the stationary cylinder for all ar the rms lift coefficient in a higher ar case however shows a large amplification in the lift force oscillation see fig 9 a for example at ar 0 75 the maximum c l reaches a value as high as 1 80 however at ar 0 1 the maximum c l 0 81 interestingly the lift force decomposition shows a trade off between viscous and pressure forces this is evident in the hydrodynamic force coefficients shown in fig 10 a similar trend to c l can be detected in the pressure component as evident from fig 10 a because of the lack of the afterbody preventing the associated pressure force from inducing the lift a reverse trend is displayed by the viscous component in fig 10 b in particular the maximum viscous lift fluctuation is increased with decreasing ar the reason is that a predominant contribution of the tangential viscous force component acts strongly in the lift direction for the flat like cylinder which can also be implicated from the vorticity distribution along the cylinder surface shown in fig 11 in figs 8 b and 9 b a reduction of ar is seen to amplify the drag force acting on the cylinder the total drag coefficient follows the amplitude response trend as the amplified oscillation increases the drag forces it is also evident that the drag force variation is mainly due to the shape profile change related to ar this can be noticed from the pressure distribution comparison at ar 0 1 and 1 0 in fig 12 the flow separation at lower ar creates an intensified wake downstream with a higher pressure difference between the front and rear cylinder surfaces see fig 12 enlarging the pressure drag component in addition at lower ar the pressure on the cylinder wall is mainly projected onto the flow direction resulting in a higher drag force exerting on the cylinder 4 3 time histories and oscillation frequencies figs 13 16 show the representative cases of displacement and lift force time histories of an elliptical cylinder for different ar and corresponding fft spectra the signal time traces and fft plots show remarkable similarities especially in the initial branch for all ar cases a quasi periodic behavior can be observed in the lift force components as presented in figs 13 a 16 a we can also notice that at the onset of initial branch the vortex shedding frequency of the lower ar cylinder has a greater value even at such a low u r with a significant lift and amplification in the vibration response a periodic region in the initial branch is characterized by a large amplitude oscillation and a single dominating frequency component in the vibration response as seen in figs 13 b and 14 b for the lower ar multiple frequency components in both the lift and amplitude responses can also be noticed in a certain range of the lower branch as seen in figs 13 c 14 c and 15 b for the representative cases of different ar this beating phenomenon is associated with a sudden drop in the amplitude response of y r m s such multiple frequency components are however suppressed with a further increase in ar and they are only found in the lift force component for ar 0 75 see fig 16 b however for ar 1 0 such variation is also observed at the transition state between the lower branch and de synchronization regimes the u r range for which a periodic and quasi periodic response is observed for different ar is shown in fig 17 the cylinder dynamic response is further elucidated in fig 17 by plotting the phase portraits between the amplitude response and the lift force component as a function of u r along with y r m s d to illustrate the region where the phase jump occurs the phase difference ϕ between y and c l is estimated from the component of a signal corresponding to the predominant frequency it is observed that ϕ is close to zero for a low u r and 180 for a higher u r although a phase difference for ar 0 75 and 1 0 occurs within the region of the lower branch that for all other ar occurs at the onset of the lower branch this is also one of the main reason for the small lower branch response in the lower ar case because of the multiple frequency components and beating phenomenon variable phase differences could be seen for the cylinder with a lower ar evidenced by time series and fft plots the variation of the frequency characteristics with u r is presented in fig 18 here f l is the lift force vortex shedding frequency f y is the vibration frequency and f s t is the vortex shedding frequency associated with the flow past a stationary cylinder a broad range of the synchronization can be observed where the vortex shedding frequency is almost equal to that of the cylinder vibration frequency however a significant difference can be observed in the lock in regime from that of the classical circular cylinder here the lock in occurs over a wide range of u r as a function of ar with the pre onset for the cylinder with a lower ar in particular the onset of the lock in for ar 0 1 is observed at u r 2 7 while at u r 4 7 for ar 1 0 as viv occurs for the low m it is characterized by a jump in the vortex shedding and oscillation frequencies in two stages firstly a jump occurs with a slight detuning effect termed as a soft lock in it is defined as the synchronization regime where the vortex shedding frequency of the vibrating cylinder is greater than that of the stationary cylinder although it is less than the structural natural frequency this is observed for all ar cases denoting the onset of the initial branch this branch is distinguished by a sudden increase in the amplitude response the wider initial branch may be linked to a higher value of following f l strength for the lower ar as apparent from fig 18 the second stage involves a proximity where the oscillation frequency is close to the natural frequency characterized by the maximum oscillation amplitude and marking the onset of the lower branch an interesting observation can be made when the oscillation and vortex shedding frequencies approaches being close to f s t with a gradual switching of f y and f l from that of the natural frequency to f s t in the lower ar case the cylinder with a higher ar is still synchronized with the natural frequency as noticed in fig 18 this feature emphasizes the significance of the afterbody in the lower branch and justifies how the cylinder with a higher ar has a wider lower branch in contrast to the sudden jump to a small amplitude for a low ar from fig 18 a b and c it is also noticed that at the onset of the lower branch the vortex shedding and vibration frequencies are greater than f s t and f n such that this region is characterized by the beating phenomenon with multiple frequency components as discussed earlier and shown in fig 17 in the desynchronization state however the cylinder vibrates at the vortex shedding frequency associated with the flow past the stationary elliptical cylinder at re 100 with a small offset of f y and f l from f s t this may be caused by the associated transformation in the vortex shedding frequency especially for the cylinder with ar 0 75 and 1 0 however unlike the case at a higher ar a distinct abrupt switching to the desynchronization regime is not observed in a lower ar case 4 4 vortex shedding modes the instantaneous vorticity contours show a 2s vortex shedding mode for all u r as shown in figs 19 21 for the lower ar the complex and interesting flow dynamic characteristics distinguished by different variants of 2s regime are observed in the initial branch with a high oscillation amplitude further a relatively smaller longitudinal spacing between the shed vortices is noticed in the near wake in the lock in region than that in a de synchronization regime because of a high oscillation frequency for ar 0 1 a sharp corner fixes the separation point of the shear layer and vortex formation this is clearly evidenced in figs 11 and 12 where an abrupt peak of the vorticity and pressure is fixed nearly at θ 90 and 270 even at different phase instants in contrast the associated peaks are moved upward and downward at ar 1 0 this results in the concentrated vorticity core developed in a greater compact form from the cylinder case with a lower a r on the onset of the initial branch the vortex shed from the cylinder surface merges in the wake of the cylinder with the same sign vortices as illustrated in figs 19 b and 20 a such phenomenon is due to the higher vortex shedding frequency as observed in the fft plot of the lift force as previously discussed this wake pattern is defined as c n w 2 s in navrose et al 2014 such coalescence creates an enhanced suction causing a significant increase in the lift force and hence the vibration response in the lock in regime corresponding to the high oscillation amplitude the two layered vortex street is observed see fig 19 d because of the wake instability an interaction occurs between such vortices which are finally merged downstream in the wake this interaction results in a formation of a longer wavelength secondary vortex street as specified by a representative case in fig 19 c the onset of such a coalescence of vortices is shifted downstream with the increase in u r in the initial branch as a function of amplitude response the cylinder with a higher ar however does not exhibit the parallel vortex shedding mode instead c 2s variants are observed as presented in fig 21 a such behavior is due to the relatively low amplitude of oscillation in the de synchronization state where the amplitude response is small and negligible the vorticity contour is similar to that of the flow past the stationary elliptical cylinder it is worth noting that the steady state response exhibits c 2s mode for the lower ar whereas the higher ar case shows 2s mode of wake patterns refer to figs 19 a 20 b and 21 b 4 5 effect of mass ratio to demonstrate the effect of m on viv characteristics of elliptical cylinders at a low ar we consider m 6 10 127 32 and 200 for ar 0 1 and m 6 10 50 93 and 200 for ar 0 25 figs 22 and 23 present a comparison of amplitude responses and frequency characteristics for different m it is interesting to note that even at higher m the cylinder with a lower ar still vibrates with a significant amplitude see also discussion in section 4 6 the increase in m is characterized by the limited initial branch along with the post onset of the synchronization regime further no soft lock in phenomenon is observed at the onset of the initial branch as in fig 23 in the lower branch a beating phenomenon is more pronounced for the higher m and a sharp jump in the amplitude response is observed even though the dominant oscillation frequency is still being synchronized with the natural frequency in the de synchronization regime although the cylinder with a high m attenuates to a very lower and steady state response at a higher u r a significant amplitude still persists for the lower m 10 and even at u r 20 for ar 0 1 where y m a x d is found to be 0 25 nevertheless no any major differences are observed in the vortex shedding patterns 4 6 discussion based on the dynamic response of an elastically mounted cylinder in terms of the mass spring system expressed in eq 5 an analytical expression may be derived to determine the oscillation amplitude in the lock in regime the cylinder transverse response may be expressed as 7 y y o s i n 2 π f y t here y o denotes the oscillation amplitude and f y is the oscillation frequency in the resonance condition the associated lift force coefficient may be expressed as 8 c l c l s i n 2 π f y t ϕ where the lift force is assumed to fluctuate at the cylinder oscillation frequency f y c l is the lift coefficient and ϕ denotes the phase difference between the lift and vibration responses by substituting these expressions in eq 5 we obtain an expression which may be used to approximate the response amplitude as 9 y o d c l u r 2 c o s ϕ 2 π 3 a r m 1 f y 2 f n 2 from eq 9 the response amplitude is dependent on several fluid structure parameters with ar 1 this equation is equivalent to that presented in gsell et al 2016 based on the above analytical expression parameters corresponding to the maximum amplitude for different ar are compared with numerical results in table 6 the phase differences in all ar cases are close to zero implying that its effect on the response amplitude is negligible the vibration amplitude is therefore determined by ar f y f n and the lift magnitude for a fixed mass ratio it is clear from eq 9 that the vibration amplitude is inversely proportional to ar hence we notice the increased vibration amplitude for ar 0 1 against that for ar 1 0 both values from the analytical prediction and the numerical simulation show that the vibration amplitude at ar 0 1 is nearly as twice as greater than that at ar 1 0 for a fixed ar 0 1 numerical results are also verified by the analytical expression in the case of varying m the increase in m is associated with the amplification in the lift and the vortex shedding frequency as presented in table 6 all the results are in good agreement with the analytical solution 5 conclusions numerical investigations have been carried out for the flow induced transverse vibration of an elastically mounted elliptical cylinder with a variable aspect ratio the cylinder has the major minor axis perpendicular to aligned with the uniform flow the reynolds number based on the free stream velocity and the major axis width is fixed as 100 the aspect ratio ar is based on the minor axis width over the major axis width by specifying ar 0 1 0 25 0 5 0 75 and 1 and a fixed mass ratio of 10 the fluid cylinder interactions have been simulated using the high order spectral hp element method with the variation of reduced velocities the vibration responses oscillation frequencies fluctuating drag and lift coefficients lock in regimes and vorticity contours have been presented and discussed the effect of varying mass ratios has also been considered for low ar cases numerical results highlight how ar has a significant influence on the peak oscillation amplitude of the elliptical cylinder despite the lack of afterbody the maximum response of the elliptical cylinder occurs in the case of ar 0 1 with a peak amplitude being greater as much as twice than that of the associated circular cylinder the onset of a lock in regime is found to be progressively shifted to a lower reduced velocity with decreasing ar the lower branch response exhibits a beating phenomenon owing to the multiple and competing oscillation frequencies especially in the region where the vortex shedding frequency of the oscillating cylinder is greater than the vortex shedding frequency of the stationary cylinder and than the natural frequency it is also found that the afterbody effect is pronounced mostly in the lower branch where the response behaves differently depending on ar the modified pressure and vorticity distributions in conjunction with the body profile at different ar have a significant influence on hydrodynamic coefficients the lift force decomposition shows the trade off contributions between viscous and pressure forces with the viscous pressure force being dominant for the cylinder with a lower higher ar the 2s vortex shedding mode and its variants have been observed in all ar cases on the onset of the initial branch the vortex shedding c n w 2 s mode occurs where vortices coalesce in the near wake because of a high oscillation frequency amplifying the lift force and hence the vibration response with the increase in the reduced velocity and oscillation amplitude the parallel vortex shedding mode is observed for which vortices merge downstream to form a secondary vortex street for a lower ar whereas c 2s mode is found for a higher ar the variation of m affects the post synchronization and the associated lock in bandwidth the present work may be further extended to account for an in line and rotational degree of freedom the cases with large oscillation amplitudes could be further investigated for the renewable energy application by also considering the effects of mass damping ratio reynolds number and flow direction or angle of attack credit authorship contribution statement kushwaha vijay methodology software validation formal analysis writing original

21586,this paper presents numerical investigations of the flow induced vibration of an elastically mounted elliptical cylinder with different aspect ratios the cylinder is constrained to vibrate only in the cross flow direction with the major axis being perpendicular to the uniform flow the reynolds number based on the free stream velocity and the major axis width is fixed as 100 the aspect ratio ar is based on the minor axis width over the major axis width by specifying ar 0 1 0 25 0 5 0 75 and 1 with a fixed mass ratio of 10 the fluid cylinder interactions are simulated using a high order spectral hp element method to characterize the vibration responses oscillation frequencies fluctuating drag and lift coefficients lock in regimes and vorticity contours with the variation of reduced velocities a synchronization regime is found to be directly correlated with ar for the lowest ar 0 1 the elliptical cylinder response is found to be greater as much as twice than the circular cylinder response by also exhibiting an earlier onset of the lock in the lack of the cylinder afterbody has a significant effect on the lower branch response resulting in a beating phenomenon and a rapid reduction in the response with decreasing ar the effect of varying mass ratios is also investigated for low ar cases the vortex shedding modes for all the response branches are found to be 2s with wake variants a parallel vortex shedding mode is noticed in a lower ar case with a large amplitude oscillation whereas the c 2s mode is observed in a higher ar case keywords flow induced vibration fluid structure interaction spectral hp element method elliptical cylinder aspect ratio 1 introduction the flow around a cylindrical structure has attracted great attention owing to several fundamental aspects related to the fluid dynamics of practical importance in various scientific and engineering fields for the flow structure interaction the vortex induced vibration viv is encountered in several applications such as offshore structures chimney stacks transmission cables bridges and renewable energy harvesters bernitsas et al 2008 rostami and armandei 2017 various mechanisms and fundamental physics involved in viv phenomena are well documented in the review of williamson and govardhan 2004 2008 sarpkaya 2004 and bearman 1984 extensive investigations on the circular cylinder viv have been carried out and used as the basis for other cross sectional bodies undergoing fluid structure interactions different numerical and experimental studies by brooks 1960 govardhan and williamson 2000 wang 2010 bearman 2011 ji et al 2011 bao et al 2012 srinil et al 2013 wang et al 2017 srinil et al 2018 wang et al 2019 and zhu et al 2019 have contributed to the understanding of viv of circular cylinders however on breaking of the rotational symmetry the associated flow induced vibration feature is greatly altered one of the generic examples is the rectangular square cross section sen and mittal 2011 studied the free vibration of a square cylinder at a low reynolds number r e and found various fundamental variations in viv characteristics for the identical flow condition a narrow synchronization regime was observed with the maximum transverse amplitude almost half of that reported by singh and mittal 2005 for a circular cylinder zhao et al 2019b performed an experimental study on flow induced vibrations of rectangular cylinders with 2 0 ϵ 5 0 where ϵ 1 a r and a r is the aspect ratio the minor axis width over the major axis width see e g fig 1 a he observed viv and galloping behaviors for which the onset of a lock in and vibration responses were significantly altered by a change in the aspect ratio a similar experimental research work was done by zhao et al 2019a for an elliptical cylinder 0 67 ϵ 1 50 for 860 r e 8050 he reported similar lock in characteristics but the oscillation was dominated by viv without a transverse galloping on further discussing on the effect of asymmetric bodies the pioneering work by brooks 1960 showed that the d section with a flat surface facing upstream exhibited viv and galloping phenomena whereas no vibration was observed for the reversed d shape the author suggested that the latter behavior is due to the absence of afterbody for which the pressure force associated with the shed vortices could not generate lift recently zhao et al 2018 found a contrasting strong amplitude response to that of brooks 1960 and explained that such differences might be due to a difference in the considered mass ratios the effect of afterbody by varying the inclination angle nemes et al 2012 zhao et al 2014 and a role of separation point by varying the corner curvature of a square cylinder kumar et al 2009 shed some light to the radial asymmetry effect however the flow physics describing such a feature is still lacking the present study therefore aims to investigate the wake characteristics amplitude responses and hydrodynamic force coefficients by considering the flow induced vibration of elliptical cylinders in comparison with circular and square rectangular cylinders the flow characteristics behind elliptical cylinders have been relatively less explored the elliptical cylinder covers a wide range of the geometry including a circular and flat plate section when the cylinder becomes elliptical the wake characteristics or patterns are significantly altered some previous works bhattacharya and shahajhan 2016 hasheminejad et al 2017 suggested the elliptical cylinder as a potential source of power extraction paul et al 2016 studied the effects of ar angle of attack and r e on the associated drag lift forces and strouhal number of flow past a stationary elliptical cylinder in a laminar flow regime they classified seven flow regimes related to some functional relationship of fluid force parameters thompson et al 2014 studied a low r e wake of an elliptical cylinder of different ar values and determined the strouhal frequencies being verified by experimental results of radi et al 2013 johnson et al 2004 predicted a low frequency unsteadiness in the wake of an elliptical cylinder such feature was further explained by pulletikurthi et al 2019 who employed a complex demodulation technique to segregate the amplitude signal to four different regimes quasi steady linear growth transition and saturation and concluded that the transitional part of the signal results in the temporal low frequency structures in the wake in contrast to stationary elliptical cylinders research related to viv characteristics of oscillating elliptical cylinders is still lacking subject to several parameters including r e reduced velocity mass and aspect ratios and angle of inclination or attack based on the shape and orientation hasheminejad and jarrahi 2015 studied the elliptical cylinder viv with different inclination angles and found that the lock in phenomenon gradually shifts to a higher r e with increasing ar navrose et al 2014 classified elliptical cylinder viv responses into seven different branches based on the vortex shedding regimes and force response time histories leontini et al 2018 studied the effect of flow angle of attack and reported the sensitivity of the vibration to the system asymmetry even without a sharp corner different types of the vortex shedding regimes including p s and period doubling were observed the most interesting phenomenon was for the inclination angle of 90 such that the major axis is aligned perpendicular to the flow where a wide range of large amplitude oscillations were observed moreover they also explained how the circulation of the shed vortices is related to a critical mass ratio previous studies have focused on viv of elliptical cylinders at a higher ar in the present study the effects of flow separation and afterbody are investigated by varying the ratio of the in line diameter to the cross flow diameter from being a circular cylinder to a nearly flat plate parametric studies are carried out by employing a high order spectral element method to highlight fundamental viv characteristics including vibration responses hydrodynamic force coefficients lock in regimes and wake patterns additional cases are also considered to examine the mass ratio effect on viv responses for a very low ar the paper proceeds by describing the methodology and governing equations in section 2 section 3 presents simulation parameters validation and grid independence test numerical results and discussion on elliptical cylinder viv are presented in section 4 the paper ends with conclusions in section 5 2 numerical methodology to simulate an incompressible viscous fluid flow the navier stokes and continuity equations are employed which can be expressed in the inertial coordinate system x y as 1 u t u u p 1 r e 2 u 2 u 0 where u u v represents the fluid velocity in x y coordinate direction and p is the dynamic pressure r e u d ν is the reynolds number in which u is the free stream velocity ν is the kinematic viscosity and d is the characteristics length which is assumed to be 1 0 for solving the flow over an oscillating body the fluid solver requires a certain treatment for the time dependent and moving boundary condition the difficulty of the moving computational domain is eliminated by employing a boundary fitted coordinate system such a transformation maps a deforming computational domain to a non deforming or stationary one in the current study the mapping with respect to the cylinder motion is described by the following transformation x x y y y t in which y t is used to quantify the cylinder displacement obtained from the structural spring mass model the field variables of velocity and pressure are transformed as u u v v d y t d t p p in the transformed coordinate system x y the moving body effect on the flow field is therefore accounted for by adding an extra forcing term f e 0 d 2 y t d t 2 to the navier stokes equations with the non inertial reference frame transformation li et al 2002 as 3 u t u u p 1 r e 2 u f e 4 u 0 the transverse dynamic response of an elastically mounted elliptical cylinder is modelled by a mass spring damper system as 5 y 4 π ξ y f n y 4 π 2 f n 2 y 2 c l π a r m where y y and y denote the non dimensional transverse acceleration velocity and displacement normalized by d of the elliptical cylinder ξ y is the structural damping ratio and f n is the natural frequency of the elliptical cylinder with u r u f n d being the reduced velocity the mass of the cylinder per unit length m is non dimensionalized as m m m d where m d ρ f π b d 4 is the displaced fluid mass with ρ f being the fluid density c l 2 f l ρ f u 2 d and c d 2 f d ρ f u 2 d are the lift and drag coefficients in which f l and f d are the fluid forces exerted in the transverse and in line directions the instantaneous lift and drag forces acting on the cylinder are computed by integrating the pressure and viscous stresses around the cylinder circumference 6 f t p k ν u t u k d s here k is a unit vector normal to the cylinder surface the coupled fluid structure interaction is solved in the framework of nektar which is based on the spectral hp element method newman and karniadakis 1997 karniadakis and sherwin 2013 cantwell et al 2015 the 2d spatial domain discretization employs the quadrilateral spectral elements associated with the 5th order legendre basis polynomial the velocity correction scheme guermond and shen 2003 is incorporated with the second order explicit time integration rules for the temporal discretization such a high order stiffly stable splitting projection method is an effective decoupling technique which leads to the second order accuracy for the pressure and velocity fields the dynamic response of the transversely oscillating cylinder is solved by the newmark β method the fluid forces are obtained from the flow field whereas the cylinder displacement is obtained from the equation of motion which in turn modifies the flow field and hydrodynamic forces such a fluid structure interaction is accounted for by using a loose coupling strategy for which the flow field and the cylinder motion are iteratively solved at a given time step 3 problem description the current investigation is focused on a systematic illustration of flow dynamics and response characteristics of viv of an elliptical cylinder whose the major axis is aligned perpendicular to the uniform flow stream as shown in fig 1 b five representative values of the aspect ratio a r b d defined by the ratio of the minor axis width b to the major axis width d are considered from 0 1 to 1 0 the considered aspect ratios are the same as those investigated by thompson et al 2014 who studied the wake behind a stationary elliptical cylinder however in this study the elastically mounted elliptical cylinder undergoes the transverse only viv simulations are carried out for a wide range of reduced velocities u r 2 0 11 0 based on the cylinder natural frequency table 1 reports the mass of the cylinder per unit length m for different a r for a fixed mass ratio m of 10 0 the effect of varying m on elliptical cylinder viv is also studied for low ar cases khalak and williamson 1997 stated that for a low m ξ system there is no a considerable effect on viv response a series of experiments of soti et al 2018 further showed insignificant alteration of viv characteristics and maximum responses for different ξ therefore numerical simulations are herein carried out with a negligible effect ξ y 0 for all ar the reynolds number based on the upstream flow velocity and d is fixed as 100 the problem setup is outlined in fig 2 the c type computational domain with an origin fixed at the center of the cylinder where 20d is the radius of upstream boundary whereas the downstream wake length is extended to 80d allowing to capture the wake characteristics prasanth et al 2006 and prasanth and mittal 2008 studied the effect of blockage ratio for similar simulation parameters and concluded that the blockage ratio of being less than or equal to 2 5 eliminates the effect of lateral boundaries on simulation results this supports the computational domain of blockage ratio 2 5 considered therein the dirichlet boundary condition corresponding to the free stream velocity is specified as u v u 0 at the inlet boundary while the no slip boundary condition u v 0 y is prescribed at the cylinder the far flow boundary condition u v u 0 is considered at the lateral boundaries instability may be experienced because of energetic vortices in the outlet region to account for such unsteadiness the high order outflow boundary condition see dong et al 2014 for details is assumed at the outlet 3 1 validation to validate accuracy of the computational approach viv of an elastically mounted circular cylinder is considered fig 3 a presents a comparison of transverse oscillations with those of ahn and kallinderis 2006 and borazjani et al 2008 the flow considered here is at re 150 for the cylinder with m 2 0 and ξ y 0 in fig 3 b the maximum responses in the transverse direction are compared with those of zhao et al 2013 the results verify the suitability of the current numerical approach additionally the hydrodynamic lift and frequency characteristics are also compared with results of zhao et al 2013 as shown in fig 4 a and b respectively showing a good agreement time histories of the lift force and the displacement show a quasi periodic behavior in the initial branch and a periodic behavior in the lower branch in accordance with singh and mittal 2005 see fig 5 all these results confirm accuracy and applicability of the current simulation method to further validate the reliability in viv of elliptical cylinder navrose et al 2014 is taken as a reference navrose et al 2014 investigated the free vibration of elliptical cylinder with 60 r e 140 for a wide range of ars for validation purpose some specific ar with a reduced velocity corresponding to re 100 is chosen we can observe from table 2 that the maximum oscillation amplitudes in different ar 1 ϵ cases are in good agreement with the present simulation results 3 2 convergence test the spectral spatial convergence is observed in the spectral hp element method as the order of the polynomial is increased in the mesh resolution to ensure the independence of numerical results and the computational efficiency the polynomial order p 4 6 is considered for three illustrative cases ar 0 1 and ar 0 5 at u r 4 5 and ar 1 0 at u r 5 0 corresponding to the high amplitude oscillations the non dimensional time step δ t 0 002 is used in the computations the transverse displacements and root mean squared rms values of the fluid forcing components of such three elliptical cylinders are tabulated in tables 3 5 respectively the percentage deviation of the fluid dynamic components with the increase in the polynomial order of the spectral elements are indicated inside the brackets it can be concluded that the simulations for case ii provide the acceptable accuracy for all considered cases by considering case ii in the following the final mesh would consist of 2644 spectral elements with the 5th order legendre basis polynomial as exemplified in fig 6 4 numerical results and discussion 4 1 amplitude responses fig 7 a shows rms values of normalized transverse amplitudes with varying u r for different ar cases correspondingly fig 7 b presents mean values of the top 10 of the normalized peak amplitudes zhao et al 2014 nemes et al 2012 zhao et al 2019a the normalization is made with respect to the major axis width of the cylinder it is observed that the elliptical cylinder viv exhibits different response behaviors as a function of ar for a circular cylinder with ar 1 0 the vibration response shows a typical abrupt increase of the initial branch amplitude attaining a peak amplitude of oscillation of nearly 0 6d and continuing the lower branch this is consistent with that observed by singh and mittal 2005 for the same r e the response behavior for ar 0 75 is found to be similar to that of a circular cylinder because a point of separation is not relatively fixed the corner is wider and more rounded enabling a similar vortex formation between elliptical and circular cylinders navrose et al 2014 obtained similar results in a higher ar case in contrast for the lowest ar 0 1 the response amplitude increases significantly in the range of u r 2 5 5 0 attaining a peak of nearly 1 22d being considerably greater than that for a circular cylinder at u r 5 0 it is also found that the amplitude response has a direct correlation with the decreasing ar the drastic increase in the amplitude response takes place when the afterbody is reduced by lowering ar this is in qualitative agreement with experimental observations by zhao et al 2019b for rectangular cylinders and zhao et al 2019a for elliptical cylinders from fig 7 the u r ranges for initial and lower branches are also found to be a function of ar the cylinders with ar 1 0 and 0 75 exhibit a narrow initial branch range being broadened with decreasing ar nevertheless the maximum response gradually increases as ar is decreased the onset of the initial branch in the lower ar case is noted to be earlier than that in higher ar cases because of the pre synchronization as discussed later on in section 4 3 for the lower branch the onset of this range is characterized by a beating phenomenon at a certain range of u r which may be noticed by the variation in a 10 versus y r m s the vibration response attenuates to a sudden lower value with decreasing ar such behavior is pronounced for ar 0 1 0 5 for which a relatively sharp decreased response in the lower branch is seen in fig 7 a owing to an earlier desynchronization and the associated phase difference shown in section 4 3 this feature provides a strong evidence of the afterbody effect 4 2 hydrodynamic forces variations of mean and rms values of the total hydrodynamic lift and drag force coefficients are illustrated in figs 8 and 9 respectively it is observed that the lift forces are significant at the onset of the lock in region increasing abruptly in the first halves of the synchronization this is followed by a downtrend to a very low value before a jump of the lift force to a value associated with the stationary cylinder for all ar the rms lift coefficient in a higher ar case however shows a large amplification in the lift force oscillation see fig 9 a for example at ar 0 75 the maximum c l reaches a value as high as 1 80 however at ar 0 1 the maximum c l 0 81 interestingly the lift force decomposition shows a trade off between viscous and pressure forces this is evident in the hydrodynamic force coefficients shown in fig 10 a similar trend to c l can be detected in the pressure component as evident from fig 10 a because of the lack of the afterbody preventing the associated pressure force from inducing the lift a reverse trend is displayed by the viscous component in fig 10 b in particular the maximum viscous lift fluctuation is increased with decreasing ar the reason is that a predominant contribution of the tangential viscous force component acts strongly in the lift direction for the flat like cylinder which can also be implicated from the vorticity distribution along the cylinder surface shown in fig 11 in figs 8 b and 9 b a reduction of ar is seen to amplify the drag force acting on the cylinder the total drag coefficient follows the amplitude response trend as the amplified oscillation increases the drag forces it is also evident that the drag force variation is mainly due to the shape profile change related to ar this can be noticed from the pressure distribution comparison at ar 0 1 and 1 0 in fig 12 the flow separation at lower ar creates an intensified wake downstream with a higher pressure difference between the front and rear cylinder surfaces see fig 12 enlarging the pressure drag component in addition at lower ar the pressure on the cylinder wall is mainly projected onto the flow direction resulting in a higher drag force exerting on the cylinder 4 3 time histories and oscillation frequencies figs 13 16 show the representative cases of displacement and lift force time histories of an elliptical cylinder for different ar and corresponding fft spectra the signal time traces and fft plots show remarkable similarities especially in the initial branch for all ar cases a quasi periodic behavior can be observed in the lift force components as presented in figs 13 a 16 a we can also notice that at the onset of initial branch the vortex shedding frequency of the lower ar cylinder has a greater value even at such a low u r with a significant lift and amplification in the vibration response a periodic region in the initial branch is characterized by a large amplitude oscillation and a single dominating frequency component in the vibration response as seen in figs 13 b and 14 b for the lower ar multiple frequency components in both the lift and amplitude responses can also be noticed in a certain range of the lower branch as seen in figs 13 c 14 c and 15 b for the representative cases of different ar this beating phenomenon is associated with a sudden drop in the amplitude response of y r m s such multiple frequency components are however suppressed with a further increase in ar and they are only found in the lift force component for ar 0 75 see fig 16 b however for ar 1 0 such variation is also observed at the transition state between the lower branch and de synchronization regimes the u r range for which a periodic and quasi periodic response is observed for different ar is shown in fig 17 the cylinder dynamic response is further elucidated in fig 17 by plotting the phase portraits between the amplitude response and the lift force component as a function of u r along with y r m s d to illustrate the region where the phase jump occurs the phase difference ϕ between y and c l is estimated from the component of a signal corresponding to the predominant frequency it is observed that ϕ is close to zero for a low u r and 180 for a higher u r although a phase difference for ar 0 75 and 1 0 occurs within the region of the lower branch that for all other ar occurs at the onset of the lower branch this is also one of the main reason for the small lower branch response in the lower ar case because of the multiple frequency components and beating phenomenon variable phase differences could be seen for the cylinder with a lower ar evidenced by time series and fft plots the variation of the frequency characteristics with u r is presented in fig 18 here f l is the lift force vortex shedding frequency f y is the vibration frequency and f s t is the vortex shedding frequency associated with the flow past a stationary cylinder a broad range of the synchronization can be observed where the vortex shedding frequency is almost equal to that of the cylinder vibration frequency however a significant difference can be observed in the lock in regime from that of the classical circular cylinder here the lock in occurs over a wide range of u r as a function of ar with the pre onset for the cylinder with a lower ar in particular the onset of the lock in for ar 0 1 is observed at u r 2 7 while at u r 4 7 for ar 1 0 as viv occurs for the low m it is characterized by a jump in the vortex shedding and oscillation frequencies in two stages firstly a jump occurs with a slight detuning effect termed as a soft lock in it is defined as the synchronization regime where the vortex shedding frequency of the vibrating cylinder is greater than that of the stationary cylinder although it is less than the structural natural frequency this is observed for all ar cases denoting the onset of the initial branch this branch is distinguished by a sudden increase in the amplitude response the wider initial branch may be linked to a higher value of following f l strength for the lower ar as apparent from fig 18 the second stage involves a proximity where the oscillation frequency is close to the natural frequency characterized by the maximum oscillation amplitude and marking the onset of the lower branch an interesting observation can be made when the oscillation and vortex shedding frequencies approaches being close to f s t with a gradual switching of f y and f l from that of the natural frequency to f s t in the lower ar case the cylinder with a higher ar is still synchronized with the natural frequency as noticed in fig 18 this feature emphasizes the significance of the afterbody in the lower branch and justifies how the cylinder with a higher ar has a wider lower branch in contrast to the sudden jump to a small amplitude for a low ar from fig 18 a b and c it is also noticed that at the onset of the lower branch the vortex shedding and vibration frequencies are greater than f s t and f n such that this region is characterized by the beating phenomenon with multiple frequency components as discussed earlier and shown in fig 17 in the desynchronization state however the cylinder vibrates at the vortex shedding frequency associated with the flow past the stationary elliptical cylinder at re 100 with a small offset of f y and f l from f s t this may be caused by the associated transformation in the vortex shedding frequency especially for the cylinder with ar 0 75 and 1 0 however unlike the case at a higher ar a distinct abrupt switching to the desynchronization regime is not observed in a lower ar case 4 4 vortex shedding modes the instantaneous vorticity contours show a 2s vortex shedding mode for all u r as shown in figs 19 21 for the lower ar the complex and interesting flow dynamic characteristics distinguished by different variants of 2s regime are observed in the initial branch with a high oscillation amplitude further a relatively smaller longitudinal spacing between the shed vortices is noticed in the near wake in the lock in region than that in a de synchronization regime because of a high oscillation frequency for ar 0 1 a sharp corner fixes the separation point of the shear layer and vortex formation this is clearly evidenced in figs 11 and 12 where an abrupt peak of the vorticity and pressure is fixed nearly at θ 90 and 270 even at different phase instants in contrast the associated peaks are moved upward and downward at ar 1 0 this results in the concentrated vorticity core developed in a greater compact form from the cylinder case with a lower a r on the onset of the initial branch the vortex shed from the cylinder surface merges in the wake of the cylinder with the same sign vortices as illustrated in figs 19 b and 20 a such phenomenon is due to the higher vortex shedding frequency as observed in the fft plot of the lift force as previously discussed this wake pattern is defined as c n w 2 s in navrose et al 2014 such coalescence creates an enhanced suction causing a significant increase in the lift force and hence the vibration response in the lock in regime corresponding to the high oscillation amplitude the two layered vortex street is observed see fig 19 d because of the wake instability an interaction occurs between such vortices which are finally merged downstream in the wake this interaction results in a formation of a longer wavelength secondary vortex street as specified by a representative case in fig 19 c the onset of such a coalescence of vortices is shifted downstream with the increase in u r in the initial branch as a function of amplitude response the cylinder with a higher ar however does not exhibit the parallel vortex shedding mode instead c 2s variants are observed as presented in fig 21 a such behavior is due to the relatively low amplitude of oscillation in the de synchronization state where the amplitude response is small and negligible the vorticity contour is similar to that of the flow past the stationary elliptical cylinder it is worth noting that the steady state response exhibits c 2s mode for the lower ar whereas the higher ar case shows 2s mode of wake patterns refer to figs 19 a 20 b and 21 b 4 5 effect of mass ratio to demonstrate the effect of m on viv characteristics of elliptical cylinders at a low ar we consider m 6 10 127 32 and 200 for ar 0 1 and m 6 10 50 93 and 200 for ar 0 25 figs 22 and 23 present a comparison of amplitude responses and frequency characteristics for different m it is interesting to note that even at higher m the cylinder with a lower ar still vibrates with a significant amplitude see also discussion in section 4 6 the increase in m is characterized by the limited initial branch along with the post onset of the synchronization regime further no soft lock in phenomenon is observed at the onset of the initial branch as in fig 23 in the lower branch a beating phenomenon is more pronounced for the higher m and a sharp jump in the amplitude response is observed even though the dominant oscillation frequency is still being synchronized with the natural frequency in the de synchronization regime although the cylinder with a high m attenuates to a very lower and steady state response at a higher u r a significant amplitude still persists for the lower m 10 and even at u r 20 for ar 0 1 where y m a x d is found to be 0 25 nevertheless no any major differences are observed in the vortex shedding patterns 4 6 discussion based on the dynamic response of an elastically mounted cylinder in terms of the mass spring system expressed in eq 5 an analytical expression may be derived to determine the oscillation amplitude in the lock in regime the cylinder transverse response may be expressed as 7 y y o s i n 2 π f y t here y o denotes the oscillation amplitude and f y is the oscillation frequency in the resonance condition the associated lift force coefficient may be expressed as 8 c l c l s i n 2 π f y t ϕ where the lift force is assumed to fluctuate at the cylinder oscillation frequency f y c l is the lift coefficient and ϕ denotes the phase difference between the lift and vibration responses by substituting these expressions in eq 5 we obtain an expression which may be used to approximate the response amplitude as 9 y o d c l u r 2 c o s ϕ 2 π 3 a r m 1 f y 2 f n 2 from eq 9 the response amplitude is dependent on several fluid structure parameters with ar 1 this equation is equivalent to that presented in gsell et al 2016 based on the above analytical expression parameters corresponding to the maximum amplitude for different ar are compared with numerical results in table 6 the phase differences in all ar cases are close to zero implying that its effect on the response amplitude is negligible the vibration amplitude is therefore determined by ar f y f n and the lift magnitude for a fixed mass ratio it is clear from eq 9 that the vibration amplitude is inversely proportional to ar hence we notice the increased vibration amplitude for ar 0 1 against that for ar 1 0 both values from the analytical prediction and the numerical simulation show that the vibration amplitude at ar 0 1 is nearly as twice as greater than that at ar 1 0 for a fixed ar 0 1 numerical results are also verified by the analytical expression in the case of varying m the increase in m is associated with the amplification in the lift and the vortex shedding frequency as presented in table 6 all the results are in good agreement with the analytical solution 5 conclusions numerical investigations have been carried out for the flow induced transverse vibration of an elastically mounted elliptical cylinder with a variable aspect ratio the cylinder has the major minor axis perpendicular to aligned with the uniform flow the reynolds number based on the free stream velocity and the major axis width is fixed as 100 the aspect ratio ar is based on the minor axis width over the major axis width by specifying ar 0 1 0 25 0 5 0 75 and 1 and a fixed mass ratio of 10 the fluid cylinder interactions have been simulated using the high order spectral hp element method with the variation of reduced velocities the vibration responses oscillation frequencies fluctuating drag and lift coefficients lock in regimes and vorticity contours have been presented and discussed the effect of varying mass ratios has also been considered for low ar cases numerical results highlight how ar has a significant influence on the peak oscillation amplitude of the elliptical cylinder despite the lack of afterbody the maximum response of the elliptical cylinder occurs in the case of ar 0 1 with a peak amplitude being greater as much as twice than that of the associated circular cylinder the onset of a lock in regime is found to be progressively shifted to a lower reduced velocity with decreasing ar the lower branch response exhibits a beating phenomenon owing to the multiple and competing oscillation frequencies especially in the region where the vortex shedding frequency of the oscillating cylinder is greater than the vortex shedding frequency of the stationary cylinder and than the natural frequency it is also found that the afterbody effect is pronounced mostly in the lower branch where the response behaves differently depending on ar the modified pressure and vorticity distributions in conjunction with the body profile at different ar have a significant influence on hydrodynamic coefficients the lift force decomposition shows the trade off contributions between viscous and pressure forces with the viscous pressure force being dominant for the cylinder with a lower higher ar the 2s vortex shedding mode and its variants have been observed in all ar cases on the onset of the initial branch the vortex shedding c n w 2 s mode occurs where vortices coalesce in the near wake because of a high oscillation frequency amplifying the lift force and hence the vibration response with the increase in the reduced velocity and oscillation amplitude the parallel vortex shedding mode is observed for which vortices merge downstream to form a secondary vortex street for a lower ar whereas c 2s mode is found for a higher ar the variation of m affects the post synchronization and the associated lock in bandwidth the present work may be further extended to account for an in line and rotational degree of freedom the cases with large oscillation amplitudes could be further investigated for the renewable energy application by also considering the effects of mass damping ratio reynolds number and flow direction or angle of attack credit authorship contribution statement kushwaha vijay methodology software validation formal analysis writing original

21587,in this work the effects of low cycle fatigue loading and stiffener height on crack propagation regularities of stiffened plates are investigated the tests are conducted on 14 cracked stiffened plate specimens using an mts322 fatigue tester videos showing the crack propagation are recorded using two electron microscopes and the data form which are used to plot the a n curves the accumulative mean strain curves are obtained from the displacement data of the loading rod the a n curves show that during the entire low cycle fatigue loading the stiffener constrains the crack propagation causing the crack propagation length of the stiffener to be greater than that of the plate additionally the accumulative mean strain which has a maximum value of about 1 62 is observed in the specimen and is unrecoverable the data presented in this work may be useful for a more accurate calculation of time dependent change of the ultimate strength of specimens under low cycle fatigue loads keywords cracked stiffened plate symmetrical crack low cycle fatigue crack propagation accumulative mean strain 1 introduction to improve transportation efficiency use of large scale ships in ocean transportation has been increasingly observed in recent years due to their large dimensions and use of high strength steel the structure of large scale ships is subjected to high stress and large deformation under extreme sea conditions resulting in low cycle fatigue damage this has been a key issue that needs to be solved during the development of large scale ships the low cycle fatigue strength of the structural components itself is an important aspect of assessing the structural strength and the influence of low cycle fatigue damage on the ultimate strength of the ship structure is also an important aspect that cannot be ignored stiffened plate is an important basic component of a ship structure thus it is important to study the crack propagation and the response of cracked stiffened plate under low cycle fatigue loads various experiments have been carried out to study the crack propagation problem of stiffened plates dexter and pilarski 2002 carried out an experiment on welded stiffened plates under bending loads to study the effects of welding residual stress transverse butt welds and drain holes on the crack propagation rate of stiffener dexter et al 2003 established a theoretical model of stress intensity factor by considering the residual stress distribution of stiffened plates based on linear elastic fracture mechanics they obtained the model that can accurately predict the crack propagation of the box girders with welded stiffeners mahmoud and dexter 2005 carried out an experiment on stiffened plates under tensile fatigue loads to study the crack propagation when large cracks interact with stiffeners their results showed that types of stiffeners have little effect on the crack propagation of stiffened plates llopart et al 2006 studied the fatigue crack propagation and crack steering of stiffened plates containing a type i crack their results indicated that the stringer geometry has a significant effect on crack propagation when the crack is near the stringer and the crack has a greater probability of turning when the crack is far away from the stringer yuen et al 2006 measured the residual stress of the cracked welded stiffened plate using neutron diffraction strain scanning technique they found that the crack propagation rate in the stiffened plate is significantly smaller than that in unstiffened plate they also observed that the introduction of residual compressive stress between the stiffeners during the welding process can further reduce the crack propagation rate sepe et al 2015 carried out fatigue crack propagation experiments on the friction stir welded fsw stiffened plates and employed the linear elastic finite element method and double boundary element method to simulate the crack propagation their simulation model can generate results that agree well with the experimental results the ship structure is a large welded structure thus it is inevitable that welding defects and crack propagation are found in the vicinity of the weld area however the above research only studied cracks that are located between the stiffeners studies on crack propagation near the weld area have rarely been conducted or reported many studies on the low cycle fatigue strength of various materials have also been conducted xia et al 1996 used different preloading procedures of gr 70 steel to distinguish between the ratcheting effect on the material s fatigue life from the mean stress effect their results showed that both the positive mean stress and the ratchet strain have an adverse effect on the fatigue life of the material kang et al 2005 2006 conducted a low cycle fatigue test with a stress controlled mean stress of 25cdv4 11 steel and ss304 steel they found that 25cdv4 11 steel has cyclic softening characteristics and its ratchet strain increases with the increasing number of cycles whereas ss304 steel has cyclic hardening characteristics and its ratchet strain decreases as the number of cycles increases they also discovered that when the low cycle fatigue load is small the material failure is controlled by ratchet strain and low cycle fatigue damage but when the load is large material failure is caused mainly by ratchet strain paul et al 2010 conducted ratchet and low cycle fatigue tests on sa333 steel and observed that sa333 steel has cyclic hardening characteristics throughout its low cycle fatigue life and the ratchet strain increases with the increase of mean stress and stress amplitude deng et al 2016 used theoretical analysis and finite element simulation method to study the relationship between ctod and crack length stress amplitude and mean stress by considering the cumulative plastic strain at the crack tip dong et al 2016 proposed a theoretical model a relationship between crack propagation rate and crack tip opening displacement under low cycle fatigue loads dong et al 2019 carried out crack propagation experiments on ct specimens with a single two tensile overloads and described that overload ratio has a significant retardation effect on crack propagation rate in recent years a number of studies both experiments and simulations have been conducted to study the ultimate strength of cracked plates and stiffened plates paik et al 2005 2008 2009 margaritis and toulios 2012 bayatfar et al 2014 xu et al 2014 wang et al 2015 cui et al 2016 shi et al 2017 xia et al 2018 however these studies failed to consider the change of geometric properties of cracked plates and stiffened plates after crack propagation thus in this paper the experimental study is performed to investigate low cycle fatigue crack propagation on cracked stiffened plates with symmetrical cracks through stiffeners the effects of low cycle fatigue loading and stiffener height on crack propagation and accumulative mean strain of the cracked stiffened plates are determined under the conditions of 1 a constant maximum stress 2 a constant stress amplitude 3 a constant mean stress and 4 a constant low cycle fatigue loading the a n curves for the cracked stiffened plates under low cycle fatigue loads are constructed and their accumulative mean strain during crack propagation are measured the data presented in this work can be used as experimental data for validation of other theoretical methods or simulation models they can also be useful for a more accurate calculation of time dependent change of the ultimate strength of specimens under low cycle fatigue 2 experimental 2 1 test material ah32 steel plates are used as the cracked stiffened plates the uniaxial tensile mechanical properties of the plates are shown in fig 1 a and their uniaxial tensile stress strain curves are shown in fig 1 b t1 and t2 are the same standard tensile specimens the chemical composition and properties of the material are shown in table 1 and table 2 respectively 2 2 test specimen according to the classification of cracked stiffened plates described by margaritis and toulios 2012 and cui et al 2017 and the cracked stiffened plates designed by yuen et al 2006 the approximate shape of the cracked stiffened plate specimen with the crack symmetrically through the stiffener are firstly designed from the low cycle fatigue experiments previously carried out deng et al 2016 dong et al 2016 deng et al 2017 dong et al 2019 it was known that the maximum load divided by the effective cross section area of the specimen reached the yield strength of the material the fatigue life would less than 10000 cycles based on the yield strength of the material described in section 2 1 and the available maximum load of the fatigue test machine described in section 2 3 the detailed dimensions of the specimen and the length of the precrack for the experiment are designed the shape and dimensions of the cracked stiffened plate specimen are shown in fig 2 the specimen total length is l t 560 mm and total width is w t 200 mm the plate and stiffener have a same thickness t 3 mm to reduce stress concentration at the end of the stiffener during low cycle fatigue loading the radius of the transition arc is r 50 mm the effective segment of the specimen is shown as a red rectangle in fig 2 a the length of the effective segment is l e 200 mm and its width is w e 100 mm the crack with a length 2 a 16 mm is prefabricated at the center of the plate using a wire edm machine the location and length of the crack are shown in fig 2 b to fasten the specimen seven circular holes with a radius of r 10 mm are made at the top and bottom of the plate the positions of the holes are shown in fig 2 a the length of the stiffener is l s 300 mm the size of the plate and the length of the prefabricated crack are the same in all specimens the plate containing the prefabricated crack and the stiffener are welded together to form a final cracked stiffened plate specimen the weld is a double sided continuous fillet weld and its size is shown in fig 2 b to study the effect of different low cycle fatigue loadings on the crack propagation of the specimen three sets of low cycle fatigue loadings are 1 low cycle fatigue loading with a constant maximum stress but different stress ratio 2 low cycle fatigue loading with a constant stress amplitude but different average stresses and 3 low cycle fatigue loading with a constant average stress but different stress amplitudes in each set four different levels of low cycle fatigue loading are used the height of the stiffener in the specimen is h s 15 mm the influence of stiffener height on crack propagation is studied using two specimens with different stiffener height h s 10 mm and h s 20 mm a total of 14 specimens are adopted in the experiment 2 3 test apparatus the low cycle fatigue loading is performed using an mts322 electro hydraulic servo fatigue test machine in the ship structure laboratory of wuhan university of technology the available maximum load of the fatigue test machine is 150 kn three types of clamp components are designed to fasten the specimen 1 the upper joint which can be screwed with the fatigue tester loading rod fig 3 a 2 the bottom plate which is fixed with the base of the fatigue test machine using 12 bolts fig 3 c 3 two l type detachable fixtures fig 3 b and d the specimen is fastened to the clamp using 22 bolts 11 at the top and 11 at the bottom the overall assembly of the specimen and the three types of clamp components on the fatigue test machine are shown in fig 4 a after assembly the center of the plate is aligned with the axis of the loading rod on the test machine 2 4 test procedure to facilitate the reading of the crack propagation length on the plate and stiffener a transparent plastic scale is attached to the plate and stiffener videos of the crack propagation are recorded using two high power electron microscopes fig 4 b fig 5 a c e are taken by the electron microscope perpendicular to the plate and fig 5 b d f are taken by the electron microscope perpendicular to the stiffener during the recording the number of cycles corresponding to the crack length is simultaneously recorded a controlling computer which is connected to the fatigue test machine records the displacement of the loading rod the accumulative mean strain of the specimen during crack propagation until fracture is calculated as the displacement change of the loading rod divides by the effective length l e of the specimen after the specimen is assembled and clamped the fatigue test machine which is programmed with a pre designed sinusoidal low cycle fatigue loading is initiated the frequency of the low cycle fatigue loading is 1 hz after the load is stabilized two electron microscopes are initiated to record the crack propagation on the plate and stiffener and the control computer is initiated to record the displacement value of the loading rod the control computer records 100 loading rod displacement values for every sinusoidal fatigue load the temperature in the laboratory is constant during the experiment after the specimen fractured all 22 bolts are loosened and the broken specimen is removed from the test machine after that the sizes of the bolt tightening and the arc transition portions of the broken specimen are measured using a vernier caliper at a precision of 0 02 mm obvious deformations are not observed the displacement value of the loading rod is considered the elongation of the effective section of the specimen the specimen numbers and the level of low cycle fatigue loading are shown in table 3 3 crack propagation results and discussion 3 1 crack propagation process and crack propagation life of cracked stiffened plate crack propagation in the plate of the specimen no 108 is shown in fig 5 a c and e and that in the stiffener is shown in fig 5 b d and f the crack propagation process is similar for other specimens according to the figures during the initial stage of crack propagation the prefabricated crack in the plate could not be opened and expanded due to the constraints by the stiffener and weld however the crack starts to expand in the stiffener when the crack in the stiffener expands to a certain length the crack in the plate starts to open and expand fig 5 shows that the maximum crack opening displacement mcod of the crack in the stiffener remains equal to that in the plate during the entire fatigue life of the specimen according to the crack propagation videos the crack propagation in the stiffener causes the stiffener to break while the crack in the plate begins to rapidly destabilize the propagation and causes the entire specimen to fracture the crack propagation life of the stiffener is the same as that of the plate thus it can be considered as the low cycle fatigue crack propagation life of the specimen an overall view of the fracture is shown in fig 6 a and a close up view of the fracture is shown in fig 6 b because the specimen is torn by a pulling force the edge of the specimen is significantly tightened fig 6 b the specimen number level of low cycle fatigue loading and crack propagation life are shown in table 3 table 3 shows that when the maximum stress is kept constant the crack propagation life increases with the increase of stress ratio and with a constant stress amplitude the crack propagation life of the specimen decreases with increasing mean stress and at a constant mean stress the crack propagation life of the specimen decreases with the increase of stress amplitude table 3 shows that the crack growth life of the specimen increases with increasing stiffener height 3 2 the a n curves of stiffener and plate the crack propagation length of the plate and stiffener are measured from the crack propagation videos when the crack grow on the stiffener and weld firstly read the crack length on the surface of the weld from the transparent plastic scale then multiplied by 2 2 to get the crack propagation length of the stiffener when the crack passes through the weld firstly read the crack length on the stiffener that is not on the weld from the transparent plastic scale then add the weld height to obtain the crack propagation length of the stiffener crack propagation length of the plate is averaged from the left and right sides of the plate that had symmetric crack propagation and the values are used to draw the a n curves the x axis is the number of cycles and the y axis is the crack propagation length of stiffener and plate the a n curves of the stiffeners and the plates of the specimen nos 101 104 nos 105 108 nos 109 112 and nos 113 114 are shown in figs 7 10 respectively figs 7 10 show that the crack propagation lengths of the stiffeners are all greater than those of the plates at all cycles for all specimens it is obvious that the crack on the stiffener grows faster than the crack on the plate this is because that the tensile stress value in the stiffener is always greater than that in the plate at same cross section duo to residual stress in stiffener tensile stress and the plate compressive stress 3 3 effects of low cycle fatigue loading and stiffener height on crack propagation the a n curves of the stiffeners of the specimen nos 101 104 nos 105 108 nos 109 112 and 113 114 are shown in figs 11 a and 12 a 13 a and 14 a respectively and those of the plates of the corresponding specimens are shown in figs 11 b 12 b and 13 b 14 b respectively indicated by the slope of the a n curves shown in fig 11 a and b the crack propagation rate of both the stiffener and the plate initially decreases with increasing stress ratio but increases rapidly thereafter as illustrated in fig 11 b during about the first half of the crack propagation life the crack length of the plate is less than 0 5 mm the stiffener and weld constrain the crack propagation of the plate in the initial stage of crack propagation fig 11 a and b show that the final crack propagation length of the stiffeners and plates are nearly the same that of the stiffeners of specimens nos 101 104 are 7 mm 7 1 mm 7 1 mm 7 3 mm respectively whereas that of the plates are 4 9 mm 5 0 mm 5 1 mm 5 2 mm respectively the slope of a n curves fig 12 a and b further indicate that the crack propagation rate of both the stiffener and the plate increases with the increase of mean stress at the initial stage of crack propagation but later increases more rapidly the a n curves in fig 12 b further show that the crack growth length of the plate is very low at the initial stage of crack propagation the detailed analysis has been described in section 3 1 according to fig 12 a and b the final crack propagation length of the stiffeners of specimens nos 105 108 are 5 5 mm 7 0 mm 7 8 mm 9 0 mm respectively whereas that of the plates are 4 2 mm 5 0 mm 6 2 mm 7 2 mm respectively the final crack propagation length of both the plate and the stiffener is reduced as the mean stress increases based on the slope of a n curves shown in fig 13 a and b at a constant mean stress the crack growth rates of both the stiffener and the plate increases with the increase of stress amplitude during the initial stage of crack propagation but at the later stage of crack propagation the increase is more accentuated according to the a n curves of the plate shown in fig 13 b the crack growth length of the plate is very low initially which is due to the reasons given in section 3 1 based on fig 13 a and b prior to specimen fracture the final crack propagation length of the stiffeners of specimens nos 109 112 are 7 0 mm 7 6 mm 8 8 mm 9 6 mm respectively whereas that of the plates are 5 0 mm 6 3 mm 6 8 mm 7 5 mm respectively the final crack propagation length of the stiffener and the plate is reduced as the stress amplitude increases the slopes of a n curves in fig 14 a and b indicate that the increase rate of crack propagation length of both the stiffener and the plate initially decreases with increasing stiffener height but later more rapidly increases the cross section area of the specimen increases with the increase of stiffener height under the same low cycle fatigue load the stress of the crack cross section decreases with the increase of the stiffener height and the stress intensity factor decreases with the increase of the stiffener height resulting in the crack propagation rate of the stiffener and plate decrease with the increase of stiffener height the a n curves in fig 14 b show that the crack growth length of the plate is very low at the initial stage of crack propagation during about the first half of the crack propagation life the crack propagation length of the plate is less than 0 5 mm although the reduction of stiffener height greatly reduces the crack propagation life of the specimen it does not change the constraint effect of the stiffener and weld on the crack propagation of the plate as illustrated in fig 14 a and b before specimen fracture the final crack propagation length of the stiffeners of specimens no 113 no 102 and no 114 are 5 0 mm 7 1 mm 7 4 mm respectively whereas that of the plates are 4 0 mm 5 0 mm 5 3 mm respectively the final crack propagation length of both the stiffener and the plate increases with the increase of stiffener height according to the crack propagation process explained in section 3 1 crack first propagates on the stiffener only when the stiffener break the plate and the specimen finally break the results of the final crack propagation length are reasonable 4 accumulative mean strain results and discussion 4 1 accumulative mean strain of cracked stiffened plate as described in section 2 4 there are 100 displacement data of the loading rod recorded in one sinusoidal cyclic load all original data are too many to be considered thus only one cycle data from fifty cycles are took to draw the displacement curve of the loading rod the original data on loading rod displacement of the specimen no 101 which are also like those of other specimens are shown in fig 15 here the x axis is the loading time the x axis is also the number of cycles for the loading frequency of 1 hz the y axis is the displacement value of the loading rod the red line blue line green line is the displacement data of the loading rod at maximum stress mean stress and minimum stress respectively considering the specimen no 101 the minimum load is zero fig 15 shows that the specimen remains elongated although after the low cycle fatigue load returns to zero this demonstrates that prefabricated crack is different from crack generated due to low cycle fatigue crack propagation fig 15 indicates that under low cycle fatigue loads the specimen becomes elongated as crack propagation such elongation is not recoverable the elongation of the specimen during the low cycle fatigue crack propagation is calculated by subtracting the loading rod displacement value at corresponding mean stress value in each cycle from that of the first cycle the accumulative mean strain of the specimen during crack propagation is calculated by dividing the elongation of the specimen by the length of the effective section l e 4 2 effects of low cycle fatigue loading and stiffener height on accumulative mean strain the accumulative mean strain curves during the entire low cycle fatigue crack propagation life of the specimen nos 101 104 are shown in fig 16 a to more clearly show the accumulative mean strain value at the initial stage of the crack propagation the curves at accumulative mean strain of less than 0 25 are also prepared as shown in fig 16 b similarly the accumulative mean strain curves during the entire fatigue life of the specimens nos 105 108 nos 109 112 and nos 113 114 are shown in figs 17 a and 18 a and 19 a respectively and their corresponding curves at accumulative mean strain of less than 0 25 are shown in figs 17 b 18 b and 19 b respectively as shown in fig 16 a during the initial stage of crack propagation the accumulative mean strain is small and the growth rate is very low by contrast at a later stage of crack propagation the accumulative mean strain increases rapidly as indicated by the slope of the a n curves shown in fig 16 b the increase rate of accumulative mean strain decreases as the stress ratio increases during the initial stage of crack propagation during crack propagation the effective cross sectional area effective cross sectional area cross sectional area of the entire specimen cross sectional area of the crack continuously reduces while the mcod increases this leads to the increase of accumulative mean strain according to fig 16 a the maximum accumulative mean strain of the specimens nos 101 104 before fracture are 1 60 1 60 1 62 1 64 respectively as depicted in fig 17 a the accumulative mean strain of the specimen is small with extremely low growth rate during the initial stage of crack propagation but thereafter increases more rapidly the slope of the accumulative mean strain curves fig 17 b show that the growth rate of the accumulative mean strain increases with the increase of mean stress at the initial stage of crack propagation the maximum accumulative mean strain of the specimens nos 105 108 before fracture are 1 54 1 62 1 65 1 68 respectively the accumulative mean strain curves in fig 18 a illustrate that at the initial stage of crack propagation the accumulative mean strain of the specimen is low and with very low increase rate at the later stage of crack propagation the accumulative mean strain of the specimen increases rapidly the slope of the accumulative mean strain curves in fig 18 b indicate that the accumulative mean strain growth rate increases with the increase of stress amplitude at the initial stage of crack propagation it is supposed that because the height of weld area in the specimen no 109 is slightly higher than that in the specimen no 110 its accumulative mean strain is lower the maximum accumulative mean strain of the specimens nos 109 112 before fracture are 1 63 1 63 1 64 1 65 respectively fig 19 a shows that the accumulative mean strain of the specimen is small with extremely low growth rate initially but is increases rapidly thereafter the slopes of the a n curves depicted in fig 19 b show that the accumulative mean strain growth rate decreases with the increase of stiffener height at the initial stage of crack propagation prior to specimen fracture the maximum accumulative mean strain of the specimens no 113 and no 114 are 1 48 and 1 67 the average value of the maximum of accumulative mean strain of all specimens is 1 62 5 conclusions in conclusion the effects of low cycle fatigue loading and stiffener height on crack propagation and accumulative mean strain of 14 cracked stiffened plates have been analyzed 1 the crack propagation length of the stiffener is greater than that of the plate at all cycles for all 14 specimens the stiffener constrains the crack propagation of the plate during the entire low cycle fatigue loading 2 the accumulative mean strain is generated in the specimen a maximum value is about 1 62 and is not

21587,in this work the effects of low cycle fatigue loading and stiffener height on crack propagation regularities of stiffened plates are investigated the tests are conducted on 14 cracked stiffened plate specimens using an mts322 fatigue tester videos showing the crack propagation are recorded using two electron microscopes and the data form which are used to plot the a n curves the accumulative mean strain curves are obtained from the displacement data of the loading rod the a n curves show that during the entire low cycle fatigue loading the stiffener constrains the crack propagation causing the crack propagation length of the stiffener to be greater than that of the plate additionally the accumulative mean strain which has a maximum value of about 1 62 is observed in the specimen and is unrecoverable the data presented in this work may be useful for a more accurate calculation of time dependent change of the ultimate strength of specimens under low cycle fatigue loads keywords cracked stiffened plate symmetrical crack low cycle fatigue crack propagation accumulative mean strain 1 introduction to improve transportation efficiency use of large scale ships in ocean transportation has been increasingly observed in recent years due to their large dimensions and use of high strength steel the structure of large scale ships is subjected to high stress and large deformation under extreme sea conditions resulting in low cycle fatigue damage this has been a key issue that needs to be solved during the development of large scale ships the low cycle fatigue strength of the structural components itself is an important aspect of assessing the structural strength and the influence of low cycle fatigue damage on the ultimate strength of the ship structure is also an important aspect that cannot be ignored stiffened plate is an important basic component of a ship structure thus it is important to study the crack propagation and the response of cracked stiffened plate under low cycle fatigue loads various experiments have been carried out to study the crack propagation problem of stiffened plates dexter and pilarski 2002 carried out an experiment on welded stiffened plates under bending loads to study the effects of welding residual stress transverse butt welds and drain holes on the crack propagation rate of stiffener dexter et al 2003 established a theoretical model of stress intensity factor by considering the residual stress distribution of stiffened plates based on linear elastic fracture mechanics they obtained the model that can accurately predict the crack propagation of the box girders with welded stiffeners mahmoud and dexter 2005 carried out an experiment on stiffened plates under tensile fatigue loads to study the crack propagation when large cracks interact with stiffeners their results showed that types of stiffeners have little effect on the crack propagation of stiffened plates llopart et al 2006 studied the fatigue crack propagation and crack steering of stiffened plates containing a type i crack their results indicated that the stringer geometry has a significant effect on crack propagation when the crack is near the stringer and the crack has a greater probability of turning when the crack is far away from the stringer yuen et al 2006 measured the residual stress of the cracked welded stiffened plate using neutron diffraction strain scanning technique they found that the crack propagation rate in the stiffened plate is significantly smaller than that in unstiffened plate they also observed that the introduction of residual compressive stress between the stiffeners during the welding process can further reduce the crack propagation rate sepe et al 2015 carried out fatigue crack propagation experiments on the friction stir welded fsw stiffened plates and employed the linear elastic finite element method and double boundary element method to simulate the crack propagation their simulation model can generate results that agree well with the experimental results the ship structure is a large welded structure thus it is inevitable that welding defects and crack propagation are found in the vicinity of the weld area however the above research only studied cracks that are located between the stiffeners studies on crack propagation near the weld area have rarely been conducted or reported many studies on the low cycle fatigue strength of various materials have also been conducted xia et al 1996 used different preloading procedures of gr 70 steel to distinguish between the ratcheting effect on the material s fatigue life from the mean stress effect their results showed that both the positive mean stress and the ratchet strain have an adverse effect on the fatigue life of the material kang et al 2005 2006 conducted a low cycle fatigue test with a stress controlled mean stress of 25cdv4 11 steel and ss304 steel they found that 25cdv4 11 steel has cyclic softening characteristics and its ratchet strain increases with the increasing number of cycles whereas ss304 steel has cyclic hardening characteristics and its ratchet strain decreases as the number of cycles increases they also discovered that when the low cycle fatigue load is small the material failure is controlled by ratchet strain and low cycle fatigue damage but when the load is large material failure is caused mainly by ratchet strain paul et al 2010 conducted ratchet and low cycle fatigue tests on sa333 steel and observed that sa333 steel has cyclic hardening characteristics throughout its low cycle fatigue life and the ratchet strain increases with the increase of mean stress and stress amplitude deng et al 2016 used theoretical analysis and finite element simulation method to study the relationship between ctod and crack length stress amplitude and mean stress by considering the cumulative plastic strain at the crack tip dong et al 2016 proposed a theoretical model a relationship between crack propagation rate and crack tip opening displacement under low cycle fatigue loads dong et al 2019 carried out crack propagation experiments on ct specimens with a single two tensile overloads and described that overload ratio has a significant retardation effect on crack propagation rate in recent years a number of studies both experiments and simulations have been conducted to study the ultimate strength of cracked plates and stiffened plates paik et al 2005 2008 2009 margaritis and toulios 2012 bayatfar et al 2014 xu et al 2014 wang et al 2015 cui et al 2016 shi et al 2017 xia et al 2018 however these studies failed to consider the change of geometric properties of cracked plates and stiffened plates after crack propagation thus in this paper the experimental study is performed to investigate low cycle fatigue crack propagation on cracked stiffened plates with symmetrical cracks through stiffeners the effects of low cycle fatigue loading and stiffener height on crack propagation and accumulative mean strain of the cracked stiffened plates are determined under the conditions of 1 a constant maximum stress 2 a constant stress amplitude 3 a constant mean stress and 4 a constant low cycle fatigue loading the a n curves for the cracked stiffened plates under low cycle fatigue loads are constructed and their accumulative mean strain during crack propagation are measured the data presented in this work can be used as experimental data for validation of other theoretical methods or simulation models they can also be useful for a more accurate calculation of time dependent change of the ultimate strength of specimens under low cycle fatigue 2 experimental 2 1 test material ah32 steel plates are used as the cracked stiffened plates the uniaxial tensile mechanical properties of the plates are shown in fig 1 a and their uniaxial tensile stress strain curves are shown in fig 1 b t1 and t2 are the same standard tensile specimens the chemical composition and properties of the material are shown in table 1 and table 2 respectively 2 2 test specimen according to the classification of cracked stiffened plates described by margaritis and toulios 2012 and cui et al 2017 and the cracked stiffened plates designed by yuen et al 2006 the approximate shape of the cracked stiffened plate specimen with the crack symmetrically through the stiffener are firstly designed from the low cycle fatigue experiments previously carried out deng et al 2016 dong et al 2016 deng et al 2017 dong et al 2019 it was known that the maximum load divided by the effective cross section area of the specimen reached the yield strength of the material the fatigue life would less than 10000 cycles based on the yield strength of the material described in section 2 1 and the available maximum load of the fatigue test machine described in section 2 3 the detailed dimensions of the specimen and the length of the precrack for the experiment are designed the shape and dimensions of the cracked stiffened plate specimen are shown in fig 2 the specimen total length is l t 560 mm and total width is w t 200 mm the plate and stiffener have a same thickness t 3 mm to reduce stress concentration at the end of the stiffener during low cycle fatigue loading the radius of the transition arc is r 50 mm the effective segment of the specimen is shown as a red rectangle in fig 2 a the length of the effective segment is l e 200 mm and its width is w e 100 mm the crack with a length 2 a 16 mm is prefabricated at the center of the plate using a wire edm machine the location and length of the crack are shown in fig 2 b to fasten the specimen seven circular holes with a radius of r 10 mm are made at the top and bottom of the plate the positions of the holes are shown in fig 2 a the length of the stiffener is l s 300 mm the size of the plate and the length of the prefabricated crack are the same in all specimens the plate containing the prefabricated crack and the stiffener are welded together to form a final cracked stiffened plate specimen the weld is a double sided continuous fillet weld and its size is shown in fig 2 b to study the effect of different low cycle fatigue loadings on the crack propagation of the specimen three sets of low cycle fatigue loadings are 1 low cycle fatigue loading with a constant maximum stress but different stress ratio 2 low cycle fatigue loading with a constant stress amplitude but different average stresses and 3 low cycle fatigue loading with a constant average stress but different stress amplitudes in each set four different levels of low cycle fatigue loading are used the height of the stiffener in the specimen is h s 15 mm the influence of stiffener height on crack propagation is studied using two specimens with different stiffener height h s 10 mm and h s 20 mm a total of 14 specimens are adopted in the experiment 2 3 test apparatus the low cycle fatigue loading is performed using an mts322 electro hydraulic servo fatigue test machine in the ship structure laboratory of wuhan university of technology the available maximum load of the fatigue test machine is 150 kn three types of clamp components are designed to fasten the specimen 1 the upper joint which can be screwed with the fatigue tester loading rod fig 3 a 2 the bottom plate which is fixed with the base of the fatigue test machine using 12 bolts fig 3 c 3 two l type detachable fixtures fig 3 b and d the specimen is fastened to the clamp using 22 bolts 11 at the top and 11 at the bottom the overall assembly of the specimen and the three types of clamp components on the fatigue test machine are shown in fig 4 a after assembly the center of the plate is aligned with the axis of the loading rod on the test machine 2 4 test procedure to facilitate the reading of the crack propagation length on the plate and stiffener a transparent plastic scale is attached to the plate and stiffener videos of the crack propagation are recorded using two high power electron microscopes fig 4 b fig 5 a c e are taken by the electron microscope perpendicular to the plate and fig 5 b d f are taken by the electron microscope perpendicular to the stiffener during the recording the number of cycles corresponding to the crack length is simultaneously recorded a controlling computer which is connected to the fatigue test machine records the displacement of the loading rod the accumulative mean strain of the specimen during crack propagation until fracture is calculated as the displacement change of the loading rod divides by the effective length l e of the specimen after the specimen is assembled and clamped the fatigue test machine which is programmed with a pre designed sinusoidal low cycle fatigue loading is initiated the frequency of the low cycle fatigue loading is 1 hz after the load is stabilized two electron microscopes are initiated to record the crack propagation on the plate and stiffener and the control computer is initiated to record the displacement value of the loading rod the control computer records 100 loading rod displacement values for every sinusoidal fatigue load the temperature in the laboratory is constant during the experiment after the specimen fractured all 22 bolts are loosened and the broken specimen is removed from the test machine after that the sizes of the bolt tightening and the arc transition portions of the broken specimen are measured using a vernier caliper at a precision of 0 02 mm obvious deformations are not observed the displacement value of the loading rod is considered the elongation of the effective section of the specimen the specimen numbers and the level of low cycle fatigue loading are shown in table 3 3 crack propagation results and discussion 3 1 crack propagation process and crack propagation life of cracked stiffened plate crack propagation in the plate of the specimen no 108 is shown in fig 5 a c and e and that in the stiffener is shown in fig 5 b d and f the crack propagation process is similar for other specimens according to the figures during the initial stage of crack propagation the prefabricated crack in the plate could not be opened and expanded due to the constraints by the stiffener and weld however the crack starts to expand in the stiffener when the crack in the stiffener expands to a certain length the crack in the plate starts to open and expand fig 5 shows that the maximum crack opening displacement mcod of the crack in the stiffener remains equal to that in the plate during the entire fatigue life of the specimen according to the crack propagation videos the crack propagation in the stiffener causes the stiffener to break while the crack in the plate begins to rapidly destabilize the propagation and causes the entire specimen to fracture the crack propagation life of the stiffener is the same as that of the plate thus it can be considered as the low cycle fatigue crack propagation life of the specimen an overall view of the fracture is shown in fig 6 a and a close up view of the fracture is shown in fig 6 b because the specimen is torn by a pulling force the edge of the specimen is significantly tightened fig 6 b the specimen number level of low cycle fatigue loading and crack propagation life are shown in table 3 table 3 shows that when the maximum stress is kept constant the crack propagation life increases with the increase of stress ratio and with a constant stress amplitude the crack propagation life of the specimen decreases with increasing mean stress and at a constant mean stress the crack propagation life of the specimen decreases with the increase of stress amplitude table 3 shows that the crack growth life of the specimen increases with increasing stiffener height 3 2 the a n curves of stiffener and plate the crack propagation length of the plate and stiffener are measured from the crack propagation videos when the crack grow on the stiffener and weld firstly read the crack length on the surface of the weld from the transparent plastic scale then multiplied by 2 2 to get the crack propagation length of the stiffener when the crack passes through the weld firstly read the crack length on the stiffener that is not on the weld from the transparent plastic scale then add the weld height to obtain the crack propagation length of the stiffener crack propagation length of the plate is averaged from the left and right sides of the plate that had symmetric crack propagation and the values are used to draw the a n curves the x axis is the number of cycles and the y axis is the crack propagation length of stiffener and plate the a n curves of the stiffeners and the plates of the specimen nos 101 104 nos 105 108 nos 109 112 and nos 113 114 are shown in figs 7 10 respectively figs 7 10 show that the crack propagation lengths of the stiffeners are all greater than those of the plates at all cycles for all specimens it is obvious that the crack on the stiffener grows faster than the crack on the plate this is because that the tensile stress value in the stiffener is always greater than that in the plate at same cross section duo to residual stress in stiffener tensile stress and the plate compressive stress 3 3 effects of low cycle fatigue loading and stiffener height on crack propagation the a n curves of the stiffeners of the specimen nos 101 104 nos 105 108 nos 109 112 and 113 114 are shown in figs 11 a and 12 a 13 a and 14 a respectively and those of the plates of the corresponding specimens are shown in figs 11 b 12 b and 13 b 14 b respectively indicated by the slope of the a n curves shown in fig 11 a and b the crack propagation rate of both the stiffener and the plate initially decreases with increasing stress ratio but increases rapidly thereafter as illustrated in fig 11 b during about the first half of the crack propagation life the crack length of the plate is less than 0 5 mm the stiffener and weld constrain the crack propagation of the plate in the initial stage of crack propagation fig 11 a and b show that the final crack propagation length of the stiffeners and plates are nearly the same that of the stiffeners of specimens nos 101 104 are 7 mm 7 1 mm 7 1 mm 7 3 mm respectively whereas that of the plates are 4 9 mm 5 0 mm 5 1 mm 5 2 mm respectively the slope of a n curves fig 12 a and b further indicate that the crack propagation rate of both the stiffener and the plate increases with the increase of mean stress at the initial stage of crack propagation but later increases more rapidly the a n curves in fig 12 b further show that the crack growth length of the plate is very low at the initial stage of crack propagation the detailed analysis has been described in section 3 1 according to fig 12 a and b the final crack propagation length of the stiffeners of specimens nos 105 108 are 5 5 mm 7 0 mm 7 8 mm 9 0 mm respectively whereas that of the plates are 4 2 mm 5 0 mm 6 2 mm 7 2 mm respectively the final crack propagation length of both the plate and the stiffener is reduced as the mean stress increases based on the slope of a n curves shown in fig 13 a and b at a constant mean stress the crack growth rates of both the stiffener and the plate increases with the increase of stress amplitude during the initial stage of crack propagation but at the later stage of crack propagation the increase is more accentuated according to the a n curves of the plate shown in fig 13 b the crack growth length of the plate is very low initially which is due to the reasons given in section 3 1 based on fig 13 a and b prior to specimen fracture the final crack propagation length of the stiffeners of specimens nos 109 112 are 7 0 mm 7 6 mm 8 8 mm 9 6 mm respectively whereas that of the plates are 5 0 mm 6 3 mm 6 8 mm 7 5 mm respectively the final crack propagation length of the stiffener and the plate is reduced as the stress amplitude increases the slopes of a n curves in fig 14 a and b indicate that the increase rate of crack propagation length of both the stiffener and the plate initially decreases with increasing stiffener height but later more rapidly increases the cross section area of the specimen increases with the increase of stiffener height under the same low cycle fatigue load the stress of the crack cross section decreases with the increase of the stiffener height and the stress intensity factor decreases with the increase of the stiffener height resulting in the crack propagation rate of the stiffener and plate decrease with the increase of stiffener height the a n curves in fig 14 b show that the crack growth length of the plate is very low at the initial stage of crack propagation during about the first half of the crack propagation life the crack propagation length of the plate is less than 0 5 mm although the reduction of stiffener height greatly reduces the crack propagation life of the specimen it does not change the constraint effect of the stiffener and weld on the crack propagation of the plate as illustrated in fig 14 a and b before specimen fracture the final crack propagation length of the stiffeners of specimens no 113 no 102 and no 114 are 5 0 mm 7 1 mm 7 4 mm respectively whereas that of the plates are 4 0 mm 5 0 mm 5 3 mm respectively the final crack propagation length of both the stiffener and the plate increases with the increase of stiffener height according to the crack propagation process explained in section 3 1 crack first propagates on the stiffener only when the stiffener break the plate and the specimen finally break the results of the final crack propagation length are reasonable 4 accumulative mean

complexity of the rigid spool connecting the pipeline and the limitations to the flexible jumper connecting the production unit which need to be carefully addressed in the design and in some cases may cause the system to be disregarded for specific projects this work consists of evaluating the feasibility of a proposed novel system where the pipeline is integrated to the riser considering a transition section to bring the lower catenary section to the near vertical section of the riser in a smooth manner by means of a multiple line system to keep the functionality and integrity of the

standing risers to date have been implemented in the west africa region such as total egina and total kaombo in 1440m and 1600m of water depth respectively but also had few experiences in other regions such as petrobras cascade chinook in gom at 2600m and petrobras lula n and lula s extreme in santos basin at 2170m the free standing riser is kept in place in a quasi vertical configuration by means of a proper foundation at the seabed via suction pile and with a cylindrical submerged buoyancy tank bt at the top of the riser as illustrated in fig 1 the water depth at the top of the bt varies from each region depending on the environmental conditions but typically stays between 150 and 250m the riser is built with a lower and an upper assembly at the bottom and at the top with the purpose to allow future connection to the pipeline and to the production unit pu respectively the connection to the pipeline is normally performed by means of a rigid spool which is designed to withstand the forces and moments caused by the pipeline expansion and the angular movement of the riser the connection to the pu has been provided to date by means of a flexible jumper which absorbs great part of the pu movements mitigating potential fatigue effect on the riser the free standing riser concept can be further visualized in tellier and thethi 2009 tan et al 2018 kim et al 2018 and in abs guidance notes on subsea hybrid riser systems american bureau of shipping the major benefits of a free standing riser when compared to the most traditional free hanging and lazy wave risers are the reduction in the required payload for the pu the potential anticipation of production because it can be installed prior to the pu being moored in the field the possibility of having the pu positioned close to the wells due to the smaller footprint and being more resistant to fatigue and combined loads since the pu movements are uncoupled from the riser furthermore steel catenary risers show potential fatigue issues at the touchdown point for ship shape pus wang et al 2015 and cardoso et al 2019 and slug flow induced oscillation is a big concern for the design of lazy wave risers wang and duan 2013 and bordalo and morooka 2018 however two major challenges are still present for some applications of free standing risers the complexity of the rigid spools which in some cases may require a 3 dimensional configuration pellegrini et al 2017 and the limitation of flexible jumpers in terms of size and internal pressure resistance in order to improve the design of the free standing riser system it is being proposed to consider two major changes to the system integrate the riser to the pipeline avoiding the use of a rigid spool which now is replaced by a transition section kept in place by a multiple line system bomfimsilva and jorge 2018 and the use of rigid pipes to replace the flexible jumper rombado et al 2012 in order to have a novel technology available for the industry a comprehensive qualification program is required to be fulfilled being common to establish technical readiness levels trl to assess measure the maturity status of the new technology as the development progresses for subsea systems api rp 17n 2017 has proposed specific trl to indicate the extent to which new subsea technologies are ready for use given specified qualification factors requirements in this particular the current work is intended to prove the concept functionality by using numerical analysis also making reference to common features considered in the existing technology the assessment of the novel system follow the industry practices for risers which are captured in the main design standards such as the guidance notices on subsea hybrid riser systems american bureau of shipping 2017 which is specific for free standing risers and the api standard 2rd and the dnvgl st f201 which have broader application for dynamic risers and are considered to complement the abs guidance notices all those standards consider checking the systems against ultimate strength long life fatigue and components resistance ultimate strength is checked applying static and dynamic global analysis for a variety of environmental conditions combined with the production unit drifting positions being the pipe local resistance checked against the internal and external pressure axial tension bending moment and combined loads in deepwater risers the pipe hydrostatic pressure acting on the pipe wall is one of the most critical factors affecting the pipe local resistance due to the potential for pipe collapse not just in straight pipe sections but also in sections where a combination of hydrostatic pressure bending and tension exist the pipe collapse has been investigated among others by murphey and langner 1985 and by kyriakides and corona 2007 and the results from the extensive research have been incorporated into the industry standards fatigue life should be evaluated taking into consideration all possible cyclic loads such as those arising from the movements of the floating production unit the vortex induced vibration viv the vortex induced motion from the buoyancy tank slugging and installation loads fatigue damage can be calculated using an s n curve approach qualified for the intended service conditions being the total damage accrued using the miner s rule component resistance should be checked considering the resulting loads from the global analysis applying local stress analysis for the purpose of this assessment the functionality of the proposed concept is evaluated based on global analysis to check whether a proper configuration can be achieved to fulfill ultimate strength requirements the potential fatigue damage resulting from the production unit movements is also assessed by checking the level of stress variation in extreme analysis in a very conservative evaluation in case of viv it is assumed that the entire riser can be provided with viv suppressor resulting in very low vibration amplitudes being such consideration a common practice in preliminary assessment of dynamic risers all analyses are performed by numerical simulation applying the orcaflex software version 10 3a orcina which is a recognized software for global dynamic riser analysis in the market the work is divided in six steps as follow step 1 develop a geometric model to provide input information for the numerical simulations step 2 perform a screening assessment of possible configurations for the multiple line system searching for potential options step 3 perform static analysis of the entire riser system to allow determination of an appropriate jumper length also checking how variations in pu position affects the transition section of the riser step 4 develop design methodology for optimization of the pipe wall along the riser to minimize the required mass for the bt step 5 perform dynamic analysis to check whether the riser can operate in extreme conditions and step 6 perform parametric analysis to assess the robustness of the system 2 geometric model the geometric model is created to provide input information for the numerical simulation such as the length of the multiple lines the position where the lines are connected onto the riser and the coordinate of the suction pile on the seabed the model assumes that the riser is divided in three sections catenary section transition section and vertical section as illustrated in fig 2 when integrating directly the riser to the pipeline it is crucial to consider a transition section which can smoothly integrate the lower section of the riser in a catenary configuration to the nearly vertical section of the riser the multiple line system as illustrated in fig 2 has been idealized for such purpose comprising of several lines to connect pre selected points located along the riser to a focal point which in turn is connected to the suction pile at the seabed via the main line the hypothesis is that it should be possible to find a position for the suction pile and appropriate lengths for the multiple lines which would allow for such smooth transition not only for the neutral configuration of the riser but also for the ones when it is connected to the pu via jumper for all pu drifting positions allowed by its mooring system in a given environment 2 1 catenary section the model construction begins with the definition of the catenary configuration as illustrated in fig 3 by defining the height y and the minimum radius r min the catenary equations are provided below reminding that the minimum radius along the catenary is defined by the ratio between the horizontal force h c and the submerged weight of the pipe w s 1 r m i n o d 2 s b 2 h c r m i n w s 3 t c h c sin α 4 y x h c w s cosh x w s h 5 s x h c w s sinh x w s h 2 2 transition section the primary idealized geometry considered for the transition section is a circumference with the lower point having the same angle to the vertical as at the top of the catenary section α it is expected that the actual system will get a geometry close to the circumference when reducing the length of the transition section and or increasing the number of lines however for simplicity the number of lines should be kept as a minimum to improve installation time and to allow for a better control of the proper desired configuration in order to get the geometry for the multiple line system the angle of the master line to the vertical β is needed to be found which is determined by the static equilibrium when isolating the transition section together with the multiple line system up to the focal point as shown in fig 4 the β angle is obtained by solving the following system of equations noting that wts is the total submerged weight of the transition section 6 t a sin β t c sin α 7 t a cos β t b t c cos α w t s it should be noted that t b is obtained by the difference between the bt net buoyancy and the submerged weight of the vertical section for simplicity the jumper is not considered at this stage of analysis nor any environmental loading the resulting geometric input data required for the numerical simulation is provided in the appendix 3 numerical model the riser and the jumper are modeled in orcaflex as lines which are represented by a series of lumps of mass joined together by massless springs the lumps of mass are called nodes and the springs are called elements each element represents a short piece of the line whose properties mass buoyancy drag etc have been lumped for modeling purposes at the nodes at its ends fig 5 illustrates the model applied by orcaflex to the lines the lines can be divided in sections being each one carrying its own set of properties such as diameter mass per unit length and bend stiffness the two ends of the line can be independently free fixed anchored or connected to a vessel buoy or other marine objects for this assessment the riser is setup as the main line being modeled with the lower end anchored at the seabed leaving the upper end free where the buoyancy tank and the jumper are attached to it in this work the riser is divided in sections to allow for changing gradually the element sizes so the critical sections can be provided with smaller elements the sections also allow for modeling different pipe wall thicknesses along the riser as judged appropriate the jumper is also divided in sections for the same reasons as for the riser and in this case it also allows both ends to be modeled with tapered sections with different material properties to represent the titanium stress joints torsional effects are also considered in the model since they affect the local bending moments between connected lines which needs to be addressed especially at the connecting point of the jumper to the top of the riser it should be noted that the top of the riser is fitted with the upper assembly which is a quite stiff structure being designed to properly transfer the moments from the jumper to the riser sections the design of such structure is out of the purpose of the current work the static analysis in orcaflex is run to find positions and orientation for each element in the model such that all forces and moments are in equilibrium the resulting configuration is provided as a starting point for the dynamic simulations orcaflex dynamic analysis can be performed using two different approaches frequency domain and time domain this work considers the time domain analysis since it provides more accurate results the time domain analysis is fully nonlinear and mass damping stiffness loading etc are evaluated at each time step taking into consideration instantaneous time varying geometry the simulation is run in consecutive stages as defined by user and it includes a buildup stage during which wave and vessel motions are smoothly ramped up from zero to their full size the equation of motion which orcaflex solves in the time domain approach correlates the inertia damping and stiffness loads within the system m p a c p v and k p with the external loads f p v t applying the position velocity and acceleration vectors p v and a as shown below 8 m p a c p v k p f p v t the complementary time domain dynamic integration scheme re compute the system geometry at every time step and so the simulation takes full account of all geometric nonlinearities including the spatial variation of wave and contact loads orcaflex allows for two time domain dynamic integration schemes explicit and implicit being the implicit scheme selected for this work implicit integration is provided by orcaflex using the generalized α integration scheme as described by chung and hulbert 1993 which is provided with a controllable numerical damping to remove the spurious non physical high frequency response inherent to the finite element method the software uses a built in value of 0 4 for the level of high frequency dissipation chosen to give fast simulation run times without compromising the accuracy of the results the forces and moments acting on each free body and line node are calculated considering their own weight buoyancy hydrodynamic and aerodynamic drag hydrodynamic added mass effects using morison s equation tension and shear bending and torque seabed reaction and friction contact forces with other objects and forces applied by links and winches orcaflex has been tested and validated against theory other similar programs and real world applications a major validation exercise was carried out to compare orcaflex with model test results obtained from a joint industry project hartnup et al 1987 and good agreement was obtained more details on the software validation can be found in the testing and qualification documentation orcina and orcaflex 2015 4 configuration screening the main purpose of this assessment is to evaluate how changes in the configuration of the multiple line system affect the local curvatures along the transition section for a variety of anticipated configurations the maximum local curvature is measured and compared with the curvature given by the theoretical circumference it should be possible to determine which configuration provides the best compromise between low amplification factor defined by the ratio of the maximum local curvature to the theoretical circumference and the minimum number of lines this assessment considers typical premises for deepwater projects also applying conservative assumptions as follows riser made up of 8 625 od steel pipe with 1 125 wt and yield strength of 448 mpa along the entire length the net buoyancy at the top of the riser is defined as the required buoyancy to keep 1000 kn vertical force at the foundation in the worst condition which is obtained when the entire riser and the jumper section disconnected from the pu are flooded it is assumed that the jumper length is 1400m long with the same pipe characteristics as the riser for this particular assessment the top of the riser is assumed to be at 300m below sea level for a 2200m water depth the riser is considered filled with a fluid density of 850 kg m3 catenary is defined with the minimum radius equivalent to the maximum bend stress being 30 of the specified minimum yield stress smys which assumption will be optimized in the design optimization section the radius of the circumference is defined as having the bending stress equivalent to 45 of the smys which assumption will be optimized in the design optimization section all lines are modeled using high axial stiffness 100e 06 kn to keep them with low stretch this premise allows the comparison of the resulting curvatures with the theoretical curvature of the circumference so it is possible to determine an amplification factor for the curvature at each connecting point along the riser if more realistic axial stiffness were used the length of the lines had to be adjusted to obtain the theoretical value under loading which would require much more effort to achieve the same results when considering the stiffer lines catenary height evaluated at 200m and 400m focal point height evaluated at the following points o at the highest point which is at the intersection between the directions formed by the catenary top tension and the vertical section o at the top of the catenary section toc o 20m below toc 50m below toc and 80m below toc except for the focal point assessed at the highest possible point the evaluation of the transition section is divided into two four and eight segments noting that the number of segments n will generate n 1 lines connecting the riser to the focal point for the focal point at the highest location just one segment is considered it should be noted that for the highest possible focal point with only one segment in the transition section very low radial load is envisaged to be applied by the multiple lines making possible a substantial reduction in the curvature amplification factor for this particular case the multiple line system has been denominated as circumscriptive line system prior to the analysis begins a calibration is performed to ensure the element length is appropriate and provide accurate results this is performed by simulating similar analysis applying different element sizes it is assumed the element size is accurate when the results compared to the similar analysis with half element size provide good approximation the critical points where the riser is most impacted are the connecting points at the transition section in that section the accuracy of the results was obtained when the element size was equal to 0 05m in case of the circumscriptive line system however longer elements being 0 2m long have shown to be sufficiently accurate for the regions where the element size is not critical as in the catenary and vertical catenary sections the element size is gradually increased in a rate not less than one to two until it reaches 5m long the numerical simulation model is presented in fig 6 showing the base case where the catenary height is 200m the focal point is at the toc and the transition section is divided in four segments s1 s2 s3 and s4 the circle shown in fig 6 is a solid type element having a radius of 172 15m which equals to the theoretical curvature of 5 840e 03 the purpose of showing the solid circle is just to illustrate the connecting points at the riser are located in the simulation at close approximation to the theoretical points the circle is located 40m away from the riser plane to not interfere in the analysis fig 7 in turn presents the numerical model for the circumscriptive line system fig 8 and fig 9 present the curvature and the curvature amplification factor caf found for the base case model varying the number of segments the caf has been determined dividing the maximum curvature found in the transition section by the one defined for the theoretical circumference for the 200 m toc height the results show that the curvature reduces as the number of segments increases and the tendency is the curvature to reach the circumferential theoretical value when larger number of segments are defined for the system for the 400 m toc height however the same did not occur this can be explained by noting that all lines had some reaction force to help keeping the transition section in the required geometry for the 200 m toc height where some of the lines for the 400 m toc height did not have any reaction the difference can be visualized by comparing fig 10 with fig 11 which curvatures are extracted from orcaflex for the toc 200m and toc 400m respectively along the transition section knowing that the origin of the arc length along the riser is at the top end at the bt it should be observed the nine peaks representing the nine lines with tension contributing to keep the transition section in the required geometry in the first plot for the 200 m toc height against only five shown in the second plot for the 400 m toc height being both models built with eight segments in the transition section it is possible that the results for the 400 m toc height can be improved by slightly changing the length of the lines but it also shows how difficult should be playing with the design tolerances to keep the transition section in a proper shape when considering a large number of lines fig 12 shows the results for varying the focal point height keeping the remaining characteristics as the base case it should be noted that the higher the focal point is setup the lower will be the resulting maximum curvature the maximum height possible is when reaching the circumscriptive model and for this case the maximum resulting curvature was found to be 7 08 e 03 rad m which is associated to the caf of 1 21 when elevating the toc height to 400m the internal angle of the transition section reduces making possible in this case to reduce the maximum curvature of the circumscriptive line model even further to 6 60e 03 rad m which results in the caf of 1 13 considering the reduction in caf and the lower number of lines the circumscriptive line model has been selected as the preferable option for the proposed system before the following assessments take place a specific checking has been performed to ensure that the orcaflex simulation provides accurate results regarding the impact of the multiple lines arrangement to the riser curvatures this has been achieved by building a model on the abaqus software as illustrated in fig 13 for comparison purpose the model comprises of 100m section of the riser where the top starts 21m above the connecting point to the upper circumscriptive line and ends slightly above the connecting point to the lower circumscriptive line the riser section is hanging initially from the top of the model being then submitted to the force applied by the upper circumscriptive line fu 3313 3 kn 0 12 degree to the vertical to the loads applied by the lower cut section of the riser fa 5 33 kn 26 4 degrees to the vertical fs 5 07 kn mb 78 95knm and the submerged weight the gravity of 6 973 m s2 is applied to simulate the submerged weight of the pipe assuming steel and seawater density of 7850 kg m3 and 1030 kg m3 respectively the loads were extracted from the correspondent orcaflex simulation for comparison purpose the riser section was modeled using the 2 node linear beam b31 element being 125 mm long for the entire section and having a pipe profile with 109 5 mm outer radius 8 625 od pipe and 28 6 mm wall thickness 1 125 the analysis was performed in static mode and the external pressure has not been simulated in abaqus since it is not expected to have any effect on the pipe curvature the result from this checking exercise is presented in fig 14 where it can be observed the good match between both models for the riser curvature along the transition section this demonstrates that orcaflex software provides good accuracy for the simulations 5 jumper configuration the purpose of this assessment is to check the feasibility of the steel jumper also evaluating the impact of the pu slow drifting to the transition section of the riser the jumper is evaluated as being 1000m and 1200m long varying the position of the pu from 400m to 1200m from the reference point which is the coordinates of the vertical section of the riser before the jumper is connected to it both sides of the jumper are modeled as free to rotate this assumption makes possible a large number of static simulation runs to be performed quickly and it does not interfere with the jumper configuration selection the jumper wt is reduced from previous work step to 0 562 as it showed to be sufficient to resist the acting loads defined in section 7 observations are then made to the maximum riser curvature at the transition section to the top angle that the jumper makes with the pu and with the riser and to the maximum utilization factor for combined loading found along the jumper the steel jumper is considered to be potentially feasible if the top angles can stay within acceptable limits and the jumper can resist to the combined loads at all potential pu slow drifting positions which are selected based on the results from this simulation analysis the pu slow drifting is assumed to have an offset of 10 of the water depth which in this case results in 220m waves and current actions are not considered at this stage and the axial stiffness of the lines is reduced to 1 00e 06 kn in order to represent more realistic values of typical mooring chains the results for the steel jumpers are presented in the graphics shown in fig 15 fig 16 and fig 17 fig 15 shows the maximum curvature for the jumper and for the riser versus the pu positions where fig 16 shows the top angle at both sides of the jumper noting that at the pu the angle refers to the vertical where at the riser the angle is the total measurement between the riser and the jumper finally fig 17 shows the maximum utilization factor along the jumper in relation to the method 1 of the combined loading as defined in the api standard 2rd the first thing that should be observed in fig 15 is that the maximum curvature within the riser does not change significantly for the range of pu positions the curvature at the transition section varied from 7 52e 03 to 8 54e 03 rad m with associated caf varying from 1 29 to 1 46 this is very positive because it does mean that the configuration of the transition section can be stable irrespective to the pu slow drifting fig 16 shows that when the slow drifting is setup further from the reference point the top angle difference between the near and far positions increases creating more challenges for fatigue resistance to the jumper it also shows that the 1000m long jumper provides much higher top angle differences mainly at the bt end in turn fig 17 shows that the pu near position should be setup with a minimum distance from the riser to keep the utilization factor within acceptable values this is mainly due to the increase in bending moment significantly when both ends of the jumper come closer to each other creating a high curvature at the lower region of the jumper for the pu at longer distances however shorter jumper lengths will be too stretched generating higher tensions which can be observed in the 1000m long jumper noting the utilization factor for combined loading increasing when the pu reaches 1000m distance to the reference point of course smaller jumpers should be more economical when they meet the integrity and functionality criteria therefore when the smaller length jumpers lead to higher top angle variations they are more prone to suffer from fatigue at the top joint connections and in this case they should be disregarded the selected jumper length for this particular study was the 1200m long and the pu slow drifting in the near and far positions were defined as being at 600m and 1040m distant from the reference point respectively this selection has the purpose to allow further investigation with respect to dynamic effects and parametric studies performed in the following sections the selected positions make the maximum combined load utilization factor to be 0 79 for the 1200m long jumper keeping some room for dynamic amplification i e 1 26 dynamic amplification factor is still available for the most critical position which is with the pu at the near position it also makes possible the maximum top angle of the jumper at the pu end to be 26 8 degree to the vertical and the maximum top angle variation from the near to the far positions to be 29 5 degree at the bt end and 17 2 degree at the pu end it should be noted that higher top angles at the pu end may cause the whipped effect to the jumper which is a particular concern for an fpso type of pu due to the potentially high accelerations arriving from the pu first order movements the results for the top angle variation potentially also mitigate fatigue at the top joint connections since they are kept within 15 rotation being within allowable limits for flex joints and stress joints type of connection 6 design optimization the design optimization aims to keep the bt within a minimum required displacement and consequently a reduced mass this can be achieved by selecting the thinnest pipe wall as possible without compromising the structural resistance a design methodology is proposed to optimize the wall thickness along the riser system as shown in fig 18 during the configuration screening assessment the minimum curvature of the catenary and the circumference radius were assumed which now are part of the optimization process along with the height of the catenary the flowchart suggests a methodology for performing hand calculations in a spreadsheet and it assumes that the jumper assessment has already been performed since information on the minimum depth and maximum curvature along the jumper are required for the design process the results from this work step are considered as input information for the following work steps i e the dynamic and parametric analysis the developed spreadsheet allows for applying one wt for the entire catenary section together with the transition section up to three different wt for the vertical section and one wt for the jumper the api standard 2rd is adopted for dimensioning criteria which applies the design format based on limiting the loads to a fraction of the pipe capacity the design criteria are then tested for the major applicable types of loads internal pressure external pressure and combined loading of tension bend moment and pressure internal and external as appropriate table 1 summarizes the design premises considered for this optimization assessment as per the api standard 2rd design criteria the minimum required wt for the pipe to resist pure collapse at the seabed level worst case is 0 446 and the minimum wt for internal pressure varies linearly from 0 472 at the seabed to 0 528 at the sea level the minimum required wt at the top of the riser i e at 300m depth to resist internal pressure is 0 520 therefore the minimum standard wt to be considered for the riser is 0 562 from the top down to 1000m depth and 0 500 from 1000m down to the seabed the jumper requires wt of 0 562 when evaluating the combined loading along the whole riser however it is clear that the wt must be increased due to the high tensions promoted by the bt displacement for the case where only one wt is considered for the entire riser the selected wt should be 0 750 it is assumed that the available wt are multiple of 1 16 1 6 mm however it is possible to consider reducing the wt by splitting the riser into more than one sections which would allow for a combination of wt that may result in a lighter structure while meeting the design criteria table 2 shows the results from 17 theoretical analysis runs obtained from the developed dimensioning spreadsheet all analysis runs meet the design criteria the numbers in bold show the figures that have been modified from previous analysis the following observations should be made from the analysis id 1 through id 4 show the entire riser with a constant wt of 0 750 changing only the toc these analysis runs provide the higher bt displacement requirement being approximately 9 above the minimum value found within the optimization process the wt optimization from id 4 through id 10 shows the most significant reduction in bt displacement from 3405 to 3147 kn the 100 m t c height requires the minimum bt displacement when compared to the other tested values 50m and 200m the difference however is not very large and it is affected by the total length of the multiple lines required for each height these results however can vary as the selected material changes for the lines which should be considered during the design process id 13 and 16 are run as an attempt to reduce the number of selected wt for the entire riser system which may improve logistics and consequently the overall project cost it did show that the difference to the minimum analysis run i e id 14 is very small about 1 or 24 kn indicating that such measure should be taken into consideration for some cases as indicated in fig 18 the curvature for each pipe wall has been defined for the catenary and transition sections when checking the combined loading criteria for this assessment it was considered the caf as 1 4 resulting in curvatures of 1 46e 02 and 9 54e 03 rad m for the catenary and transition sections of the 0 750 wall 1 17e 03 and 8 18e 03 rad m for the 0 562 wall and 9 74e 03 and 5 45e 03 rad m for the 0 500 wall it should be noted that the wt selection can be performed quite independently for the jumper for the vertical section and for the lower sections i e the catenary and the transition sections together fig 19 shows the variation in hoop stress direct tensile stress bending stress and von mises stress along the riser for the analysis id 16 in operational conditions applying the numerical model knowing that the origin of the arc length is at the top of the riser and the end is at the riser anchored point at the seabed at the top of the riser it is considered an 8 625 od solid cylinder 15m long to simulate the riser upper assembly which is important for checking any impact of the highly rigid structure to the more flexible riser pipes it can be observed that the direct tension is quite high for the vertical sections but is reduced significantly in the lower sections due to the load transfer to the riser foundation via the multiple lines conversely the lower sections are highly affected by bending which is not the case for the vertical section the pressure effect is observed in the hoop stress plot which reduces with depth due to the higher density of the surrounding seawater compared to the internal fluid and increases with reduced pipe wall 7 dynamic analysis global dynamic analysis is run to assess whether the proposed optimized system works properly when operating in extreme conditions the analysis is run in three stages being the first the buildup period with 9sec and other two with 18sec each which allows for the simulation to run with the full development of two regular wave periods the time step was setup with 0 1sec being the default value recommended by the software the accuracy of the results was tested against a particular run with time step of 0 05sec with both models providing results in a close proximity the tolerance is given by a non dimensional value and controls the accuracy of the solution the default value of 25e 06 was selected as recommended by the software being also checked against a particular run with tolerance of 12e 06 yielding both similar results demonstrating good accuracy the dynamic analysis is performed for the near far and neutral positions of the pu in operational and empty conditions to ensure that the riser can withstand the combined loads in all situations a regular wave of 21m height and 18sec period in a dean stream model is applied to simulate typical 100 year wave in brazilian deepwater depths approaching from the southwest direction typical fpso raos built from a 320m vlcc are applied to simulate the pu movements the pu is setup with a heading of 202 5 fig 20 and fig 21 provide the raos for linear and rotational movements with the wave approaching the pu at 157 5 heading being measured in relation to the bow rotating anticlockwise the jumper hang off is considered to be located at the starboard side 80m forward amidships and 5m above sea level the current load is applied on the riser assuming a typical 10 year return period current profile in brazilian deepwater depths as presented in table 3 the current direction is considered to be in plane with the riser being applied in opposite directions for the near and far pu positions assuming that the current is pushing the pu away from its neutral position it should be noted that the far position is defined as the position where the pu is moved away from the riser at most where the near position is similar but at the opposite direction in order to account for the drag forces acting on the bt its dimensions are established applying the industry practice of having the bt weight as 30 of the displacement kang et al 2012 the bt is also assumed to be sized with 6m diameter the jumper ends are fitted with tapered titanium joints and now has a fixed end connection to the pu and riser static analysis for the near and far positions are run in advance to assess the top angles the jumper makes with the pu and riser when the ends are still free to rotate the top angles are then established by the average values observed in the near and far positions the tapered titanium joint is selected with grade 29 dnv rp f201 having the main characteristics summarized in table 4 the internal diameter is kept the same as the jumper and the outer diameter is linearly increased with the wt reaching up to 3 76 2 mm key elements that may be overloaded are the connecting points of the multiple lines on the riser where concentrated loads may lead the riser to amplification of the curvature as discussed previously mitigation for this scenario is proposed considering reinforced sections at the connecting points an additional mitigation measure is also foreseen for the circumscriptive line model which considers increasing the cable length of the upper connection this number may be obtained by trial and error technique and moving the connecting point at the riser by the same distance above so that allowing for higher flexibility provided to the transition section by changing the format from circular to a kind of parabolic shape three different scenarios were selected for dynamic analysis and further parametric evaluation model 1 circular transition with toc height of 200m model 2 parabolic transition with toc height of 200m and model 3 parabolic transition with toc height of 50m the different models can be visualized in fig 22 and fig 23 fig 22 illustrates the differences between the numerical models with 200 m t c and the model with 50 m t c while fig 23 illustrates the difference between the model using a circular type transition to the models with parabolic type transition where the upper line is increased in 20m and the associated connecting point is also moved by 20m on the riser upwards the 10m reinforced pipe section with 0 688 wall is represented in the model using a thicker line all models were checked against combined loading in operational and empty conditions for the pu in the near and far positions fig 24 shows the results for model 1 with pu at the near position and fig 25 shows the same model at the far position in the plots the origin of the riser is at the top end and of the jumper is at the pu end a 15m of 0 688 pipe has been added to each side of the jumper close to the stress joint to improve pipe capacity at this critical region one important aspect observed in the results is the relatively low stress variation for the near position the maximum von mises stress variation was 5 9 of the mean value for the vertical section 2 1 for the catenary section and 1 5 for the transition section for the far position the variation increases just a little to 8 4 for the vertical section 5 9 for the catenary section and 2 6 for the transition section when looking at the slow drifting the mean stress variation was 1 2 of the mean value for the vertical section 15 3 for the catenary section and 13 3 for the transition section this means that it is likely that the riser should withstand fatigue due to wave action noting that the waves considered in this assessment are extreme and typical for 100 year return period which are much worse than those seen along the year the differences from model 1 to model 2 are small model 2 presents lower utilization factor at the transition section for all positions indicating that the parabolic configuration can reduce the stresses in that section fig 26 illustrates the differences between the two models with pu in operational conditions and at the far position it should be noted that the length of the 0 688 pipe section has been increased from 700 to 1000m in all models run in dynamic analysis when moving from the static model run in the design optimization section id 16 the reasons for that are related to the dynamic effects and the higher tensions found in the far position requiring higher capacity pipes in that region in case of model 3 the utilization factor at the transition section was at the same level as model 1 fig 27 illustrates the differences between model 1 and 3 where the longer transition section and the shorter catenary section can be observed in model 3 the results for the jumper are quite similar for all models for the worst case which is the far operational condition they show the maximum utilization factor of 0 92 8 parametric analysis parametric analysis is provided to assess the robustness of the proposed system taking into consideration the anticipated fabrication and installation tolerances and changes in the operational conditions the following parameters are part of the analysis fluid density reduced to 300 kg m3 suction anchor position moved by 30m from design position length of the main line changed by 2m from design length length of the lines connected to the riser changed by 20 cm from design length all three models can meet the design criteria when some adjustments are made however they showed differences in the parametric analysis as shown in table 5 the parametric analysis was performed with the pu in the neutral position since it has been observed that the position of the pu does not change significantly the results along the riser the results from table 5 show that the system allows acceptable tolerances for variations in the length of the multiple lines for variations in fluid density during operation and can absorb reasonably well pipeline end expansions it also shows that the toc has influence in regards to the acceptable positioning tolerances of the suction pile where the system with toc of 200m in this particular case demonstrated very good tolerance to changes in pile positioning and the toc of 50m demonstrated being very limited to changes in such pile positioning finally it is worth to review potential materials and sizes that can be considered for the multiple line system for this exercise a safety factor of 1 67 have been considered for dimensioning purpose as recommended by the abs guide abs 2018 for intact permanent moorings under dynamic conditions the worst case scenario for the resulting tensions within the multiple line system was observed when the pu was at the far position with flooded riser for the lower circumscriptive line and empty riser for the others the resulting tensions are provided in table 6 the potential materials for the multiple line system are the same as those typically considered for mooring of fpsos and risers i e mooring chains steel wires and polyester ropes table 7 provides two alternatives for the material of each line which should be considered in future detail assessment it should be noted that the chain sizes were estimated adding 4 mm corrosion allowance the steel wires are provided with hdpe sheathing for corrosion protection and the polyester ropes have parallel strand construction with added layers for sand and mud barrier underneath the cover the properties of the materials were obtained from catalogue of major suppliers the recommendation to consider two parallel mooring lines for the circumscriptive lines intends to avoid potential interference with the riser as illustrated in fig 28 the lines with the selected sizes stretch more than the ones considered in the simulation because they arrived with lower axial stiffness this however should not be a problem because the length of the lines can be adjusted during the design to compensate for the expected elongation under load nonetheless the resulting elongation within the proposed lines are within the tolerances provided by the parametric study except the polyester lines this because the polyester has much lower axial stiffness than steel resulting in the polyester ropes having approximately ten times more elongation than those obtained for chain and steel wires the polyester lines however are much lighter than steel and this can facilitate handling during installation and also making possible to provide smaller buoyancy tanks for the system the decision however can only be made after an extensive fatigue analysis is performed to ensure a proper design although further detailed analysis and design are required to define the system the estimated sizes demonstrate that they are reasonable and within supplier s production capacity 9 concluding remarks the results from this work show that a multiple line system can provide a practical solution for keeping the transition section of the novel riser system with a controllable curvature for extreme conditions with the following highlights the circumscriptive line system was found to be the most versatile and practical model and two options are possible to be considered within the design a circular type model and b parabolic type model knowing that the second provides even more flexibility for the system although it requires longer lines than the first to keep the riser in place the system demonstrated that it can withstand extreme loads reasonably well because the pu movements first and second order do not affect considerably the curvature of the riser along the transition section keeping the riser very stable the proposed riser system can accept variation in design parameters and fabrication installation tolerances reasonably well including pipeline expansion changes in fluid density and variation in line length and suction pile position although a fatigue analysis was not part of the present evaluation it can be foreseen that the riser is not likely to suffer from wave fatigue due to the relatively low stress variations observed even in extreme conditions in comparison with the traditional free standing riser the proposed system with integration of the pipeline and applying the multiple lines to control the curvature within the transition section demonstrates more simplicity eliminating complex design of the spool at the seabed eliminating the need for flex joint at the foundation and also eliminating the lower assembly and stress joint at the bottom of the riser it is expected that the novel riser system should be more economical than the traditional free standing riser model being possible to obtain large capex savings in equipment and in installation time but also in opex due to the reduced maintenance and inspection requirements the steel jumper has also shown to be promising but it is for sure more sensitive to fatigue and a full investigation should be made for design specific conditions the results from this work prove good functionality of the system to ensure the feasibility of the proposed system however further work is required including experimental model testing to endorse the numerical model and also a complete set of the design work to allow demonstrating the system can be built fit for purpose with proper engineering to all components credit authorship contribution statement carlos t p bomfimsilva

21588,free standing risers are well established in the oil and gas industry for offshore deepwater field developments there are some challenges within the current system however in regards to the complexity of the rigid spool connecting the pipeline and the limitations to the flexible jumper connecting the production unit which need to be carefully addressed in the design and in some cases may cause the system to be disregarded for specific projects this work consists of evaluating the feasibility of a proposed novel system where the pipeline is integrated to the riser considering a transition section to bring the lower catenary section to the near vertical section of the riser in a smooth manner by means of a multiple line system to keep the functionality and integrity of the entire riser along the full life cycle of the project a steel jumper is also evaluated as a potential alternative to the traditional jumper made up of flexible pipe the work applied the finite element analysis software dedicated to riser global analysis to assess the most promising configurations for the multiple line system and for the steel jumper following analytical geometric models created to establish lengths and positions to be considered in the numerical simulations as part of the work it was developed a methodology for optimizing pipe wall to keep the buoyancy tank in reasonable dimensions static analysis was performed with the purpose of searching for feasible configurations for both systems the multiple lines and the steel jumper for a variety of production unit positions dynamic analysis was performed to assess capacity of the system to withstand extreme conditions finally parametric analysis was performed to check the robustness of the proposed system to changes in the design nominal conditions such as fluid density pipeline end expansion fabrication and assembly tolerances within the multiple lines and installation tolerances for the suction pile the results demonstrate potential utilization of the novel riser system applying a circumscriptive line model which demonstrated working reasonably well in extreme conditions having enough flexibility to absorb pipeline end expansion and fabrication and installation tolerances the results also show potential application of the jumper to be made up of steel pipes applying stress titanium tapered joints at

standing risers to date have been implemented in the west africa region such as total egina and total kaombo in 1440m and 1600m of water depth respectively but also had few experiences in other regions such as petrobras cascade chinook in gom at 2600m and petrobras lula n and lula s extreme in santos basin at 2170m the free standing riser is kept in place in a quasi vertical configuration by means of a proper foundation at the seabed via suction pile and with a cylindrical submerged buoyancy tank bt at the top of the riser as illustrated in fig 1 the water depth at the top of the bt varies from each region depending on the environmental conditions but typically stays between 150 and 250m the riser is built with a lower and an upper assembly at the bottom and at the top with the purpose to allow future connection to the pipeline and to the production unit pu respectively the connection to the pipeline is normally performed by means of a rigid spool which is designed to withstand the forces and moments caused by the pipeline expansion and the angular movement of the riser the connection to the pu has been provided to date by means of a flexible jumper which absorbs great part of the pu movements mitigating potential fatigue effect on the riser the free standing riser concept can be further visualized in tellier and thethi 2009 tan et al 2018 kim et al 2018 and in abs guidance notes on subsea hybrid riser systems american bureau of shipping the major benefits of a free standing riser when compared to the most traditional free hanging and lazy wave risers are the reduction in the required payload for the pu the potential anticipation of production because it can be installed prior to the pu being moored in the field the possibility of having the pu positioned close to the wells due to the smaller footprint and being more resistant to fatigue and combined loads since the pu movements are uncoupled from the riser furthermore steel catenary risers show potential fatigue issues at the touchdown point for ship shape pus wang et al 2015 and cardoso et al 2019 and slug flow induced oscillation is a big concern for the design of lazy wave risers wang and duan 2013 and bordalo and morooka 2018 however two major challenges are still present for some applications of free standing risers the complexity of the rigid spools which in some cases may require a 3 dimensional configuration pellegrini et al 2017 and the limitation of flexible jumpers in terms of size and internal pressure resistance in order to improve the design of the free standing riser system it is being proposed to consider two major changes to the system integrate the riser to the pipeline avoiding the use of a rigid spool which now is replaced by a transition section kept in place by a multiple line system bomfimsilva and jorge 2018 and the use of rigid pipes to replace the flexible jumper rombado et al 2012 in order to have a novel technology available for the industry a comprehensive qualification program is required to be fulfilled being common to establish technical readiness levels trl to assess measure the maturity status of the new technology as the development progresses for subsea systems api rp 17n 2017 has proposed specific trl to indicate the extent to which new subsea technologies are ready for use given specified qualification factors requirements in this particular the current work is intended to prove the concept functionality by using numerical analysis also making reference to common features considered in the existing technology the assessment of the novel system follow the industry practices for risers which are captured in the main design standards such as the guidance notices on subsea hybrid riser systems american bureau of shipping 2017 which is specific for free standing risers and the api standard 2rd and the dnvgl st f201 which have broader application for dynamic risers and are considered to complement the abs guidance notices all those standards consider checking the systems against ultimate strength long life fatigue and components resistance ultimate strength is checked applying static and dynamic global analysis for a variety of environmental conditions combined with the production unit drifting positions being the pipe local resistance checked against the internal and external pressure axial tension bending moment and combined loads in deepwater risers the pipe hydrostatic pressure acting on the pipe wall is one of the most critical factors affecting the pipe local resistance due to the potential for pipe collapse not just in straight pipe sections but also in sections where a combination of hydrostatic pressure bending and tension exist the pipe collapse has been investigated among others by murphey and langner 1985 and by kyriakides and corona 2007 and the results from the extensive research have been incorporated into the industry standards fatigue life should be evaluated taking into consideration all possible cyclic loads such as those arising from the movements of the floating production unit the vortex induced vibration viv the vortex induced motion from the buoyancy tank slugging and installation loads fatigue damage can be calculated using an s n curve approach qualified for the intended service conditions being the total damage accrued using the miner s rule component resistance should be checked considering the resulting loads from the global analysis applying local stress analysis for the purpose of this assessment the functionality of the proposed concept is evaluated based on global analysis to check whether a proper configuration can be achieved to fulfill ultimate strength requirements the potential fatigue damage resulting from the production unit movements is also assessed by checking the level of stress variation in extreme analysis in a very conservative evaluation in case of viv it is assumed that the entire riser can be provided with viv suppressor resulting in very low vibration amplitudes being such consideration a common practice in preliminary assessment of dynamic risers all analyses are performed by numerical simulation applying the orcaflex software version 10 3a orcina which is a recognized software for global dynamic riser analysis in the market the work is divided in six steps as follow step 1 develop a geometric model to provide input information for the numerical simulations step 2 perform a screening assessment of possible configurations for the multiple line system searching for potential options step 3 perform static analysis of the entire riser system to allow determination of an appropriate jumper length also checking how variations in pu position affects the transition section of the riser step 4 develop design methodology for optimization of the pipe wall along the riser to minimize the required mass for the bt step 5 perform dynamic analysis to check whether the riser can operate in extreme conditions and step 6 perform parametric analysis to assess the robustness of the system 2 geometric model the geometric model is created to provide input information for the numerical simulation such as the length of the multiple lines the position where the lines are connected onto the riser and the coordinate of the suction pile on the seabed the model assumes that the riser is divided in three sections catenary section transition section and vertical section as illustrated in fig 2 when integrating directly the riser to the pipeline it is crucial to consider a transition section which can smoothly integrate the lower section of the riser in a catenary configuration to the nearly vertical section of the riser the multiple line system as illustrated in fig 2 has been idealized for such purpose comprising of several lines to connect pre selected points located along the riser to a focal point which in turn is connected to the suction pile at the seabed via the main line the hypothesis is that it should be possible to find a position for the suction pile and appropriate lengths for the multiple lines which would allow for such smooth transition not only for the neutral configuration of the riser but also for the ones when it is connected to the pu via jumper for all pu drifting positions allowed by its mooring system in a given environment 2 1 catenary section the model construction begins with the definition of the catenary configuration as illustrated in fig 3 by defining the height y and the minimum radius r min the catenary equations are provided below reminding that the minimum radius along the catenary is defined by the ratio between the horizontal force h c and the submerged weight of the pipe w s 1 r m i n o d 2 s b 2 h c r m i n w s 3 t c h c sin α 4 y x h c w s cosh x w s h 5 s x h c w s sinh x w s h 2 2 transition section the primary idealized geometry considered for the transition section is a circumference with the lower point having the same angle to the vertical as at the top of the catenary section α it is expected that the actual system will get a geometry close to the circumference when reducing the length of the transition section and or increasing the number of lines however for simplicity the number of lines should be kept as a minimum to improve installation time and to allow for a better control of the proper desired configuration in order to get the geometry for the multiple line system the angle of the master line to the vertical β is needed to be found which is determined by the static equilibrium when isolating the transition section together with the multiple line system up to the focal point as shown in fig 4 the β angle is obtained by solving the following system of equations noting that wts is the total submerged weight of the transition section 6 t a sin β t c sin α 7 t a cos β t b t c cos α w t s it should be noted that t b is obtained by the difference between the bt net buoyancy and the submerged weight of the vertical section for simplicity the jumper is not considered at this stage of analysis nor any environmental loading the resulting geometric input data required for the numerical simulation is provided in the appendix 3 numerical model the riser and the jumper are modeled in orcaflex as lines which are represented by a series of lumps of mass joined together by massless springs the lumps of mass are called nodes and the springs are called elements each element represents a short piece of the line whose properties mass buoyancy drag etc have been lumped for modeling purposes at the nodes at its ends fig 5 illustrates the model applied by orcaflex to the lines the lines can be divided in sections being each one carrying its own set of properties such as diameter mass per unit length and bend stiffness the two ends of the line can be independently free fixed anchored or connected to a vessel buoy or other marine objects for this assessment the riser is setup as the main line being modeled with the lower end anchored at the seabed leaving the upper end free where the buoyancy tank and the jumper are attached to it in this work the riser is divided in sections to allow for changing gradually the element sizes so the critical sections can be provided with smaller elements the sections also allow for modeling different pipe wall thicknesses along the riser as judged appropriate the jumper is also divided in sections for the same reasons as for the riser and in this case it also allows both ends to be modeled with tapered sections with different material properties to represent the titanium stress joints torsional effects are also considered in the model since they affect the local bending moments between connected lines which needs to be addressed especially at the connecting point of the jumper to the top of the riser it should be noted that the top of the riser is fitted with the upper assembly which is a quite stiff structure being designed to properly transfer the moments from the jumper to the riser sections the design of such structure is out of the purpose of the current work the static analysis in orcaflex is run to find positions and orientation for each element in the model such that all forces and moments are in equilibrium the resulting configuration is provided as a starting point for the dynamic simulations orcaflex dynamic analysis can be performed using two different approaches frequency domain and time domain this work considers the time domain analysis since it provides more accurate results the time domain analysis is fully nonlinear and mass damping stiffness loading etc are evaluated at each time step taking into consideration instantaneous time varying geometry the simulation is run in consecutive stages as defined by user and it includes a buildup stage during which wave and vessel motions are smoothly ramped up from zero to their full size the equation of motion which orcaflex solves in the time domain approach correlates the inertia damping and stiffness loads within the system m p a c p v and k p with the external loads f p v t applying the position velocity and acceleration vectors p v and a as shown below 8 m p a c p v k p f p v t the complementary time domain dynamic integration scheme re compute the system geometry at every time step and so the simulation takes full account of all geometric nonlinearities including the spatial variation of wave and contact loads orcaflex allows for two time domain dynamic integration schemes explicit and implicit being the implicit scheme selected for this work implicit integration is provided by orcaflex using the generalized α integration scheme as described by chung and hulbert 1993 which is provided with a controllable numerical damping to remove the spurious non physical high frequency response inherent to the finite element method the software uses a built in value of 0 4 for the level of high frequency dissipation chosen to give fast simulation run times without compromising the accuracy of the results the forces and moments acting on each free body and line node are calculated considering their own weight buoyancy hydrodynamic and aerodynamic drag hydrodynamic added mass effects using morison s equation tension and shear bending and torque seabed reaction and friction contact forces with other objects and forces applied by links and winches orcaflex has been tested and validated against theory other similar programs and real world applications a major validation exercise was carried out to compare orcaflex with model test results obtained from a joint industry project hartnup et al 1987 and good agreement was obtained more details on the software validation can be found in the testing and qualification documentation orcina and orcaflex 2015 4 configuration screening the main purpose of this assessment is to evaluate how changes in the configuration of the multiple line system affect the local curvatures along the transition section for a variety of anticipated configurations the maximum local curvature is measured and compared with the curvature given by the theoretical circumference it should be possible to determine which configuration provides the best compromise between low amplification factor defined by the ratio of the maximum local curvature to the theoretical circumference and the minimum number of lines this assessment considers typical premises for deepwater projects also applying conservative assumptions as follows riser made up of 8 625 od steel pipe with 1 125 wt and yield strength of 448 mpa along the entire length the net buoyancy at the top of the riser is defined as the required buoyancy to keep 1000 kn vertical force at the foundation in the worst condition which is obtained when the entire riser and the jumper section disconnected from the pu are flooded it is assumed that the jumper length is 1400m long with the same pipe characteristics as the riser for this particular assessment the top of the riser is assumed to be at 300m below sea level for a 2200m water depth the riser is considered filled with a fluid density of 850 kg m3 catenary is defined with the minimum radius equivalent to the maximum bend stress being 30 of the specified minimum yield stress smys which assumption will be optimized in the design optimization section the radius of the circumference is defined as having the bending stress equivalent to 45 of the smys which assumption will be optimized in the design optimization section all lines are modeled using high axial stiffness 100e 06 kn to keep them with low stretch this premise allows the comparison of the resulting curvatures with the theoretical curvature of the circumference so it is possible to determine an amplification factor for the curvature at each connecting point along the riser if more realistic axial stiffness were used the length of the lines had to be adjusted to obtain the theoretical value under loading which would require much more effort to achieve the same results when considering the stiffer lines catenary height evaluated at 200m and 400m focal point height evaluated at the following points o at the highest point which is at the intersection between the directions formed by the catenary top tension and the vertical section o at the top of the catenary section toc o 20m below toc 50m below toc and 80m below toc except for the focal point assessed at the highest possible point the evaluation of the transition section is divided into two four and eight segments noting that the number of segments n will generate n 1 lines connecting the riser to the focal point for the focal point at the highest location just one segment is considered it should be noted that for the highest possible focal point with only one segment in the transition section very low radial load is envisaged to be applied by the multiple lines making possible a substantial reduction in the curvature amplification factor for this particular case the multiple line system has been denominated as circumscriptive line system prior to the analysis begins a calibration is performed to ensure the element length is appropriate and provide accurate results this is performed by simulating similar analysis applying different element sizes it is assumed the element size is accurate when the results compared to the similar analysis with half element size provide good approximation the critical points where the riser is most impacted are the connecting points at the transition section in that section the accuracy of the results was obtained when the element size was equal to 0 05m in case of the circumscriptive line system however longer elements being 0 2m long have shown to be sufficiently accurate for the regions where the element size is not critical as in the catenary and vertical catenary sections the element size is gradually increased in a rate not less than one to two until it reaches 5m long the numerical simulation model is presented in fig 6 showing the base case where the catenary height is 200m the focal point is at the toc and the transition section is divided in four segments s1 s2 s3 and s4 the circle shown in fig 6 is a solid type element having a radius of 172 15m which equals to the theoretical curvature of 5 840e 03 the purpose of showing the solid circle is just to illustrate the connecting points at the riser are located in the simulation at close approximation to the theoretical points the circle is located 40m away from the riser plane to not interfere in the analysis fig 7 in turn presents the numerical model for the circumscriptive line system fig 8 and fig 9 present the curvature and the curvature amplification factor caf found for the base case model varying the number of segments the caf has been determined dividing the maximum curvature found in the transition section by the one defined for the theoretical circumference for the 200 m toc height the results show that the curvature reduces as the number of segments increases and the tendency is the curvature to reach the circumferential theoretical value when larger number of segments are defined for the system for the 400 m toc height however the same did not occur this can be explained by noting that all lines had some reaction force to help keeping the transition section in the required geometry for the 200 m toc height where some of the lines for the 400 m toc height did not have any reaction the difference can be visualized by comparing fig 10 with fig 11 which curvatures are extracted from orcaflex for the toc 200m and toc 400m respectively along the transition section knowing that the origin of the arc length along the riser is at the top end at the bt it should be observed the nine peaks representing the nine lines with tension contributing to keep the transition section in the required geometry in the first plot for the 200 m toc height against only five shown in the second plot for the 400 m toc height being both models built with eight segments in the transition section it is possible that the results for the 400 m toc height can be improved by slightly changing the length of the lines but it also shows how difficult should be playing with the design tolerances to keep the transition section in a proper shape when considering a large number of lines fig 12 shows the results for varying the focal point height keeping the remaining characteristics as the base case it should be noted that the higher the focal point is setup the lower will be the resulting maximum curvature the maximum height possible is when reaching the circumscriptive model and for this case the maximum resulting curvature was found to be 7 08 e 03 rad m which is associated to the caf of 1 21 when elevating the toc height to 400m the internal angle of the transition section reduces making possible in this case to reduce the maximum curvature of the circumscriptive line model even further to 6 60e 03 rad m which results in the caf of 1 13 considering the reduction in caf and the lower number of lines the circumscriptive line model has been selected as the preferable option for the proposed system before the following assessments take place a specific checking has been performed to ensure that the orcaflex simulation provides accurate results regarding the impact of the multiple lines arrangement to the riser curvatures this has been achieved by building a model on the abaqus software as illustrated in fig 13 for comparison purpose the model comprises of 100m section of the riser where the top starts 21m above the connecting point to the upper circumscriptive line and ends slightly above the connecting point to the lower circumscriptive line the riser section is hanging initially from the top of the model being then submitted to the force applied by the upper circumscriptive line fu 3313 3 kn 0 12 degree to the vertical to the loads applied by the lower cut section of the riser fa 5 33 kn 26 4 degrees to the vertical fs 5 07 kn mb 78 95knm and the submerged weight the gravity of 6 973 m s2 is applied to simulate the submerged weight of the pipe assuming steel and seawater density of 7850 kg m3 and 1030 kg m3 respectively the loads were extracted from the correspondent orcaflex simulation for comparison purpose the riser section was modeled using the 2 node linear beam b31 element being 125 mm long for the entire section and having a pipe profile with 109 5 mm outer radius 8 625 od pipe and 28 6 mm wall thickness 1 125 the analysis was performed in static mode and the external pressure has not been simulated in abaqus since it is not expected to have any effect on the pipe curvature the result from this checking exercise is presented in fig 14 where it can be observed the good match between both models for the riser curvature along the transition section this demonstrates that orcaflex software provides good accuracy for the simulations 5 jumper configuration the purpose of this assessment is to check the feasibility of the steel jumper also evaluating the impact of the pu slow drifting to the transition section of the riser the jumper is evaluated as being 1000m and 1200m long varying the position of the pu from 400m to 1200m from the reference point which is the coordinates of the vertical section of the riser before the jumper is connected to it both sides of the jumper are modeled as free to rotate this assumption makes possible a large number of static simulation runs to be performed quickly and it does not interfere with the jumper configuration selection the jumper wt is reduced from previous work step to 0 562 as it showed to be sufficient to resist the acting loads defined in section 7 observations are then made to the maximum riser curvature at the transition section to the top angle that the jumper makes with the pu and with the riser and to the maximum utilization factor for combined loading found along the jumper the steel jumper is considered to be potentially feasible if the top angles can stay within acceptable limits and the jumper can resist to the combined loads at all potential pu slow drifting positions which are selected based on the results from this simulation analysis the pu slow drifting is assumed to have an offset of 10 of the water depth which in this case results in 220m waves and current actions are not considered at this stage and the axial stiffness of the lines is reduced to 1 00e 06 kn in order to represent more realistic values of typical mooring chains the results for the steel jumpers are presented in the graphics shown in fig 15 fig 16 and fig 17 fig 15 shows the maximum curvature for the jumper and for the riser versus the pu positions where fig 16 shows the top angle at both sides of the jumper noting that at the pu the angle refers to the vertical where at the riser the angle is the total measurement between the riser and the jumper finally fig 17 shows the maximum utilization factor along the jumper in relation to the method 1 of the combined loading as defined in the api standard 2rd the first thing that should be observed in fig 15 is that the maximum curvature within the riser does not change significantly for the range of pu positions the curvature at the transition section varied from 7 52e 03 to 8 54e 03 rad m with associated caf varying from 1 29 to 1 46 this is very positive because it does mean that the configuration of the transition section can be stable irrespective to the pu slow drifting fig 16 shows that when the slow drifting is setup further from the reference point the top angle difference between the near and far positions increases creating more challenges for fatigue resistance to the jumper it also shows that the 1000m long jumper provides much higher top angle differences mainly at the bt end in turn fig 17 shows that the pu near position should be setup with a minimum distance from the riser to keep the utilization factor within acceptable values this is mainly due to the increase in bending moment significantly when both ends of the jumper come closer to each other creating a high curvature at the lower region of the jumper for the pu at longer distances however shorter jumper lengths will be too stretched generating higher tensions which can be observed in the 1000m long jumper noting the utilization factor for combined loading increasing when the pu reaches 1000m distance to the reference point of course smaller jumpers should be more economical when they meet the integrity and functionality criteria therefore when the smaller length jumpers lead to higher top angle variations they are more prone to suffer from fatigue at the top joint connections and in this case they should be disregarded the selected jumper length for this particular study was the 1200m long and the pu slow drifting in the near and far positions were defined as being at 600m and 1040m distant from the reference point respectively this selection has the purpose to allow further investigation with respect to dynamic effects and parametric studies performed in the following sections the selected positions make the maximum combined load utilization factor to be 0 79 for the 1200m long jumper keeping some room for dynamic amplification i e 1 26 dynamic amplification factor is still available for the most critical position which is with the pu at the near position it also makes possible the maximum top angle of the jumper at the pu end to be 26 8 degree to the vertical and the maximum top angle variation from the near to the far positions to be 29 5 degree at the bt end and 17 2 degree at the pu end it should be noted that higher top angles at the pu end may cause the whipped effect to the jumper which is a particular concern for an fpso type of pu due to the potentially high accelerations arriving from the pu first order movements the results for the top angle variation potentially also mitigate fatigue at the top joint connections since they are kept within 15 rotation being within allowable limits for flex joints and stress joints type of connection 6 design optimization the design optimization aims to keep the bt within a minimum required displacement and consequently a reduced mass this can be achieved by selecting the thinnest pipe wall as possible without compromising the structural resistance a design methodology is proposed to optimize the wall thickness along the riser system as shown in fig 18 during the configuration screening assessment the minimum curvature of the catenary and the circumference radius were assumed which now are part of the optimization process along with the height of the catenary the flowchart suggests a methodology for performing hand calculations in a spreadsheet and it assumes that the jumper assessment has already been performed since information on the minimum depth and maximum curvature along the jumper are required for the design process the results from this work step are considered as input information for the following work steps i e the dynamic and parametric analysis the developed spreadsheet allows for applying one wt for the entire catenary section together with the transition section up to three different wt for the vertical section and one wt for the jumper the api standard 2rd is adopted for dimensioning criteria which applies the design format based on limiting the loads to a fraction of the pipe capacity the design criteria are then tested for the major applicable types of loads internal pressure external pressure and combined loading of tension bend moment and pressure internal and external as appropriate table 1 summarizes the design premises considered for this optimization assessment as per the api standard 2rd design criteria the minimum required wt for the pipe to resist pure collapse at the seabed level worst case is 0 446 and the minimum wt for internal pressure varies linearly from 0 472 at the seabed to 0 528 at the sea level the minimum required wt at the top of the riser i e at 300m depth to resist internal pressure is 0 520 therefore the minimum standard wt to be considered for the riser is 0 562 from the top down to 1000m depth and 0 500 from 1000m down to the seabed the jumper requires wt of 0 562 when evaluating the combined loading along the whole riser however it is clear that the wt must be increased due to the high tensions promoted by the bt displacement for the case where only one wt is considered for the entire riser the selected wt should be 0 750 it is assumed that the available wt are multiple of 1 16 1 6 mm however it is possible to consider reducing the wt by splitting the riser into more than one sections which would allow for a combination of wt that may result in a lighter structure while meeting the design criteria table 2 shows the results from 17 theoretical analysis runs obtained from the developed dimensioning spreadsheet all analysis runs meet the design criteria the numbers in bold show the figures that have been modified from previous analysis the following observations should be made from the analysis id 1 through id 4 show the entire riser with a constant wt of 0 750 changing only the toc these analysis runs provide the higher bt displacement requirement being approximately 9 above the minimum value found within the optimization process the wt optimization from id 4 through id 10 shows the most significant reduction in bt displacement from 3405 to 3147 kn the 100 m t c height requires the minimum bt displacement when compared to the other tested values 50m and 200m the difference however is not very large and it is affected by the total length of the multiple lines required for each height these results however can vary as the selected material changes for the lines which should be considered during the design process id 13 and 16 are run as an attempt to reduce the number of selected wt for the entire riser system which may improve logistics and consequently the overall project cost it did show that the difference to the minimum analysis run i e id 14 is very small about 1 or 24 kn indicating that such measure should be taken into consideration for some cases as indicated in fig 18 the curvature for each pipe wall has been defined for the catenary and transition sections when checking the combined loading criteria for this assessment it was considered the caf as 1 4 resulting in curvatures of 1 46e 02 and 9 54e 03 rad m for the catenary and transition sections of the 0 750 wall 1 17e 03 and 8 18e 03 rad m for the 0 562 wall and 9 74e 03 and 5 45e 03 rad m for the 0 500 wall it should be noted that the wt selection can be performed quite independently for the jumper for the vertical section and for the lower sections i e the catenary and the transition sections together fig 19 shows the variation in hoop stress direct tensile stress bending stress and von mises stress along the riser for the analysis id 16 in operational conditions applying the numerical model knowing that the origin of the arc length is at the top of the riser and the end is at the riser anchored point at the seabed at the top of the riser it is considered an 8 625 od solid cylinder 15m long to simulate the riser upper assembly which is important for checking any impact of the highly rigid structure to the more flexible riser pipes it can be observed that the direct tension is quite high for the vertical sections but is reduced significantly in the lower sections due to the load transfer to the riser foundation via the multiple lines conversely the lower sections are highly affected by bending which is not the case for the vertical section the pressure effect is observed in the hoop stress plot which reduces with depth due to the higher density of the surrounding seawater compared to the internal fluid and increases with reduced pipe wall 7 dynamic analysis global dynamic analysis is run to assess whether the proposed optimized system works properly when operating in extreme conditions the analysis is run in three stages being the first the buildup period with 9sec and other two with 18sec each which allows for the simulation to run with the full development of two regular wave periods the time step was setup with 0 1sec being the default value recommended by the software the accuracy of the results was tested against a particular run with time step of 0 05sec with both models providing results in a close proximity the tolerance is given by a non dimensional value and controls the accuracy of the solution the default value of 25e 06 was selected as recommended by the software being also checked against a particular run with tolerance of 12e 06 yielding both similar results demonstrating good accuracy the dynamic analysis is performed for the near far and neutral positions of the pu in operational and empty conditions to ensure that the riser can withstand the combined loads in all situations a regular wave of 21m height and 18sec period in a dean stream model is applied to simulate typical 100 year wave in brazilian deepwater depths approaching from the southwest direction typical fpso raos built from a 320m vlcc are applied to simulate the pu movements the pu is setup with a heading of 202 5 fig 20 and fig 21 provide the raos for linear and rotational movements with the wave approaching the pu at 157 5 heading being measured in relation to the bow rotating anticlockwise the jumper hang off is considered to be located at the starboard side 80m forward amidships and 5m above sea level the current load is applied on the riser assuming a typical 10 year return period current profile in brazilian deepwater depths as presented in table 3 the current direction is considered to be in plane with the riser being applied in opposite directions for the near and far pu positions assuming that the current is pushing the pu away from its neutral position it should be noted that the far position is defined as the position where the pu is moved away from the riser at most where the near position is similar but at the opposite direction in order to account for the drag forces acting on the bt its dimensions are established applying the industry practice of having the bt weight as 30 of the displacement kang et al 2012 the bt is also assumed to be sized with 6m diameter the jumper ends are fitted with tapered titanium joints and now has a fixed end connection to the pu and riser static analysis for the near and far positions are run in advance to assess the top angles the jumper makes with the pu and riser when the ends are still free to rotate the top angles are then established by the average values observed in the near and far positions the tapered titanium joint is selected with grade 29 dnv rp f201 having the main characteristics summarized in table 4 the internal diameter is kept the same as the jumper and the outer diameter is linearly increased with the wt reaching up to 3 76 2 mm key elements that may be overloaded are the connecting points of the multiple lines on the riser where concentrated loads may lead the riser to amplification of the curvature as discussed previously mitigation for this scenario is proposed considering reinforced sections at the connecting points an additional mitigation measure is also foreseen for the circumscriptive line model which considers increasing the cable length of the upper connection this number may be obtained by trial and error technique and moving the connecting point at the riser by the same distance above so that allowing for higher flexibility provided to the transition section by changing the format from circular to a kind of parabolic shape three different scenarios were selected for dynamic analysis and further parametric evaluation model 1 circular transition with toc height of 200m model 2 parabolic transition with toc height of 200m and model 3 parabolic transition with toc height of 50m the different models can be visualized in fig 22 and fig 23 fig 22 illustrates the differences between the numerical models with 200 m t c and the model with 50 m t c while fig 23 illustrates the difference between the model using a circular type transition to the models with parabolic type transition where the upper line is increased in 20m and the associated connecting point is also moved by 20m on the riser upwards the 10m reinforced pipe section with 0 688 wall is represented in the model using a thicker line all models were checked against combined loading in operational and empty conditions for the pu in the near and far positions fig 24 shows the results for model 1 with pu at the near position and fig 25 shows the same model at the far position in the plots the origin of the riser is at the top end and of the jumper is at the pu end a 15m of 0 688 pipe has been added to each side of the jumper close to the stress joint to improve pipe capacity at this critical region one important aspect observed in the results is the relatively low stress variation for the near position the maximum von mises stress variation was 5 9 of the mean value for the vertical section 2 1 for the catenary section and 1 5 for the transition section for the far position the variation increases just a little to 8 4 for the vertical section 5 9 for the catenary section and 2 6 for the transition section when looking at the slow drifting the mean stress variation was 1 2 of the mean value for the vertical section 15 3 for the catenary section and 13 3 for the transition section this means that it is likely that the riser should withstand fatigue due to wave action noting that the waves considered in this assessment are extreme and typical for 100 year return period which are much worse than those seen along the year the differences from model 1 to model 2 are small model 2 presents lower utilization factor at the transition section for all positions indicating that the parabolic configuration can reduce the stresses in that section fig 26 illustrates the differences between the two models with pu in operational conditions and at the far position it should be noted that the length of the 0 688 pipe section has been increased from 700 to 1000m in all models run in dynamic analysis when moving from the static model run in the design optimization section id 16 the reasons for that are related to the dynamic effects and the higher tensions found in the far position requiring higher capacity pipes in that region in case of model 3 the utilization factor at the transition section was at the same level as model 1 fig 27 illustrates the differences between model 1 and 3 where the longer transition section and the shorter catenary section can be observed in model 3 the results for the jumper are quite similar for all models for the worst case which is the far operational condition they show the maximum utilization factor of 0 92 8 parametric analysis parametric analysis is provided to assess the robustness of the proposed system taking into consideration the anticipated fabrication and installation tolerances and changes in the operational conditions the following parameters are part of the analysis fluid density reduced to 300 kg m3 suction anchor position moved by 30m from design position length of the main line changed by 2m from design length length of the lines connected to the riser changed by 20 cm from design length all three models can meet the design criteria when some adjustments are made however they showed differences in the parametric analysis as shown in table 5 the parametric analysis was performed with the pu in the neutral position since it has been observed that the position of the pu does not change significantly the results along the riser the results from table 5 show that the system allows acceptable tolerances for variations in the length of the multiple lines for variations in fluid density during operation and can absorb reasonably well pipeline end expansions it also shows that the toc has influence in regards to the acceptable positioning tolerances of the suction pile where the system with toc of 200m in this particular case demonstrated very good tolerance to changes in pile positioning and the toc of 50m demonstrated being very limited to changes in such pile positioning finally it is worth to review potential materials and sizes that can be considered for the multiple line system for this exercise a safety factor of 1 67 have been considered for dimensioning purpose as recommended by the abs guide abs 2018 for intact permanent moorings under dynamic conditions the worst case scenario for the resulting tensions within the multiple line system was observed when the pu was at the far position with flooded riser for the lower circumscriptive line and empty riser for the others the resulting tensions are provided in table 6 the potential materials for the multiple line system are the same as those typically considered for mooring of fpsos and risers i e mooring chains steel wires and polyester ropes table 7 provides two alternatives for the material of each line which should be considered in future detail assessment it should be noted that the chain sizes were estimated adding 4 mm corrosion allowance the steel wires are provided with hdpe sheathing for corrosion protection and the polyester ropes have parallel strand construction with added layers for sand and mud barrier underneath the cover the properties of the materials were obtained from catalogue of major suppliers the recommendation to consider two parallel mooring lines for the circumscriptive lines intends to avoid potential interference with the riser as illustrated in fig 28 the lines with the selected sizes stretch more than the ones considered in the simulation because they arrived with lower axial stiffness this however should not be a problem because the length of the lines can be adjusted during the design to compensate for the expected elongation under load nonetheless the resulting elongation within the proposed lines are within the tolerances provided by the parametric study except the polyester lines this because the polyester has much lower axial stiffness than steel resulting in the polyester ropes having approximately ten times more elongation than those obtained for chain and steel wires the polyester lines however are much lighter than steel and this can facilitate handling during installation and also making possible to provide smaller buoyancy tanks for the system the decision however can only be made after an extensive fatigue analysis is performed to ensure a proper design although further detailed analysis and design are required to define the system the estimated sizes demonstrate that they are reasonable and within supplier s production capacity 9 concluding remarks the results from this work show that a multiple line system can provide a practical solution for keeping the transition section of the novel riser system with a controllable curvature for extreme conditions with the following highlights the circumscriptive line system was found to be the most versatile and practical model and two options are possible to be considered within the design a circular type model and b parabolic type model knowing that the second provides even more flexibility for the system although it requires longer lines than the first to keep the riser in place the system demonstrated that it can withstand extreme loads reasonably well because the pu movements first and second order do not affect considerably the curvature of the riser along the transition section keeping the riser very stable the proposed riser system can accept variation in design parameters and fabrication installation tolerances reasonably well including pipeline expansion changes in fluid density and variation in line length and suction pile position although a fatigue analysis was not part of the present evaluation it can be foreseen that the riser is not likely to suffer from wave fatigue due to the relatively low stress variations observed even in extreme conditions in comparison with the traditional free standing riser the proposed system with integration of the pipeline and applying the multiple lines to control the curvature within the transition section demonstrates more simplicity eliminating complex design of the spool at the seabed eliminating the need for flex joint at the foundation and also eliminating the lower assembly and stress joint at the bottom of the riser it is expected that the novel riser system should be more economical than the traditional free standing riser model being possible to obtain large capex savings in equipment and in installation time but also in opex due to the reduced maintenance and inspection requirements the steel jumper has also shown to be promising but it is for sure more sensitive to fatigue and a full investigation should be made for design specific conditions the results from this work prove good functionality of the system to ensure the feasibility of the proposed system however further work is required including experimental model testing to endorse the numerical model and also a complete set of the design work to allow demonstrating the system can be built fit for purpose with proper engineering to all components credit authorship contribution statement carlos t p bomfimsilva

21589,dam break flow over the horizontal bed with a bottom step is solved using both computational fluid dynamics and shallow water equation models the bottom step is a scenario related to greenwater overtopping of offshore structures in which a sharp variation of water depth exists from the location in front of the ship to the position on deck the effect of bottom step level on the horizontal momentum flux of dam break flow representative of its impact loading on plate type structures is investigated both these models predict a trend that the increase of bottom step level leads to an increase of the maximum horizontal momentum flux being larger than that of the classical dam break solution the increasing rate is large for a small bottom step level but becomes less sensitive for a large bottom step level this trend can be attributed to the fact that the rarefaction wave associated with draw down of water upstream of the dam travels faster with a bottom step keywords dam break bottom step greenwater overtopping horizontal momentum flux 1 introduction dam break flow occurs when a column of water is released by the sudden removal of a vertical barrier the simplest dam break model is the classical one described by ritter 1892 in which a semi infinite block of water initially at rest collapses onto a horizontal dry bed an analytical solution of water height and horizontal velocity is given by assuming shallow water condition and ignoring the non hydrostatic flow at the initial stage of dam break stansby et al 1998 since then this type of shallow gravity driven flow with different levels of complexity has been extensively investigated because of its wide application in marine hydrodynamics and coastal engineering a frequent application scenario of dam break flow is to be acted as a simplified prediction model of greenwater overtopping of offshore structures greenwater overtopping is an extreme event in harsh sea conditions in which a compact mass of water exceeds the freeboard and overtops onto the deck buchner 1995 chen et al 2019 this event has been a critical issue in safe operation and structural integrity of offshore facilities due to its damage to the deck superstructures and the equipment on deck ersdal and kvitrud 2000 faulkner 2002 the similarity between dam break flow and greenwater overtopping flow has been investigated and demonstrated by some researchers ryu et al 2007 greco et al 2005 2007 hernández fontes et al 2019 the classical dam break solution due to ritter 1892 is used to estimate greenwater flow on deck given an initial dam height based on some calculation in the fluid domain surrounding the vessel however obvious discrepancies can be observed for this prediction model in some overtopping scenarios because of some physics inherent in greenwater but ignored in the classical dam break model schoenberg and rainey 2002 for example buchner 1999 argued that the initial dam height should be 9 4 times the observed freeboard exceedance contrastingly faltinsen et al 2002 took the dam height as the observed freeboard exceedance but adjusted the time instant of the dam break for each individual event consequently some researchers have improved the classical dam break model by accounting for its physical differences with greenwater overtopping flow schønberg and rainey 2002 for example developed a potential flow model to simulate a shelf moving up and down in calm water with which the effect of the finite duration of freeboard exceedance was studied it was found that the finite duration reduces the horizontal momentum flux predicted by the classical dam break solution zhang et al 2019 further proposed a modified dam break model to incorporate the effect of overtopping duration based on which a non dimensional parameter the relative duration i e a combination of freeboard exceedance and overtopping duration is found to be a good indicator of severity of greenwater events the model of dam break with initial velocity is developed and simulated using computational fluid dynamics cfd by pham and varyani 2005 who found that this new model performed better than classical dam break model in predicting the horizontal loading of greenwater flow hernández fontes et al 2018 developed a wet dam break model to replace the incoming waves to generate different overtopping events apart from above mentioned modifications in classical dam break model another physical difference between dam break and greenwater which may lack sufficient investigations is the local geometry at the ship front i e a sharp variation of water depth from the location in front of the ship to the position on deck zhang et al 2019 to account for this effect a bottom step is introduced at the location of the dam for the classical dam break model in the present study there are a few studies on dam break flow over a bottom step most of which focus on determining the riemann solution structure of this discontinuous shallow water flow alcrudo and benkhaldoun 2001 ostapenko 2003 alcrudo and benkhaldoun 2001 presented a set of riemann solutions to the one dimensional shallow water equations swes with a bottom step discontinuity these solutions are derived from an initial wet bed condition with horizontal velocities i e both sides of the bottom step have an initial water depth larger than zero and with the assumption of no energy loss at the bottom step ostapenko 2003 focused on a particular case of those studied by alcrudo and benkhaldoun 2001 in which a static wet bed on both sides of the bottom step initial condition was considered the main efforts were focused on the proof of the solvability of the shallow water problem these previous studies provide some insights for the dam break problem with a bottom step however in the context of greenwater overtopping there are some gaps to be filled in first previous studies are mainly focused on the two side wet bed initial conditions whereas a similar scenario with greenwater overtopping requires the initial condition for bottom step dam break flow to be wet bed at one side of the bottom step corresponding to the zone in front of a ship and dry bed at the other side corresponding to the on deck region second there is a lack of comparisons of swe solutions to the bottom step dam break problem against experimental data or other advanced numerical results such as cfd simulations especially in the case that energy loss is ignored in swe solutions third it has not been clarified how the dam break flow is affected by the bottom step especially for some important physical quantities related to impact loading therefore in the present study both cfd and swes models are developed to solve this problem aiming to identify how the bottom step alters the dam break flow and in a further step explore the underlying physics causing such changes the remainder of the paper is organized as follows mathematical models including both cfd and swes are introduced in section 2 numerical results and relevant discussions are presented in section 3 the main conclusions are drawn in section 4 2 mathematical model 2 1 computational fluid dynamics a schematic of the computational fluid dynamics cfd model for a 2d dam break flow with a bottom step is shown in fig 1 a cartesian coordinate system x z is adopted with positive x being right and positive z being upward the origin of the coordinate system is set at the upper vertex of the step the depth of the step is b 0 the bottom for the region x 0 is set to be flat at z b 0 the initial water height at rest in the upstream region i e x 0 is set to be h 0 b 0 the downstream region at x 0 is characterized by an initially dry horizontal bed the problem is modelled using the two phase incompressible navier stokes equations 1 u 0 2 t ρ u ρ u u t p t ρ f b 3 t α u α 0 where eqs 1 3 represent the combined conservation of mass of two phases water and air the conservation of momentum and the conservation of the mass of the individual phases respectively α x z t 0 1 is the phase fraction of water with α 1 denoting pure water α 0 pure air and 0 α 1 a linearly weighted mixture of water and air here t is the time the velocity field for water and air is denoted as u u x z t w x z t t where the superscript t represents the transpose of the vector or matrix ρ x z t is the density t x z t is the viscous stress tensor and f b x z t 0 g is the external force due to gravity with g 9 81 m s 2 being the constant of gravitational acceleration the viscous stress tensor in eq 2 is given as follows 4 t μ u u t where μ is the dynamic viscosity the term shown in eq 4 causes the mechanical energy to be dissipated into heat due to internal viscous forces batchelor 2000 as the water and air are modelled as incompressible the density and viscosity of a fluid volume are calculated using the weighted arithmetic average of the water and air components i e ρ ρ w α ρ a 1 α and μ μ w α μ a 1 α where the subscripts w and a denote water and air phases respectively the material constants are set to their respective values at atmospheric pressure and 20 c ρ w 1000 k g m 3 ρ a 1 225 k g

volume of fluid vof surface capturing scheme for the cfd simulation see fig 1 the length l 0 and height h 0 of the initial water column is set to l 0 6 m and h 0 0 1 m the remaining region of the computational domain is characterized by l 1 6 m and h a 0 2 m a set of different values of b 0 i e b 0 h 0 0 5 1 1 5 2 3 5 7 10 15 20 are adopted in order to investigate its effect on the dam break flow characteristics although here the ratio b 0 h 0 is varied by fixing the value of h 0 and varying b 0 it has been proved in appendix b that a given b 0 h 0 whatever values of h 0 and b 0 corresponds to a unique value of normalized physical quantities for example the normalized horizontal momentum flux shown in fig 5b theoretically the length l 0 should be infinitely large to match the assumption made in the analytical solution in section 2 2 however in cfd simulation l 0 6 m is chosen based on the observation that the dam break flow is not affected by choosing a larger value of l 0 it is noted that a small value of l 0 may have an effect as the rarefaction wave its propagation speed is indicated by eq 14 may reach the left boundary before shallow water dam break flow is fully developed in cfd simulation i e when the maximum horizontal momentum flux is reached similar discussions on the effect of the length l 0 have been conducted for dam break flow with finite duration effect in zhang et al 2019 mesh convergence has been conducted although not shown here briefly speaking both the water height and horizontal momentum flux the definition is given in section 3 2 are used as the indicators for convergence the mesh is considered to be converged if the difference of the physical quantities is within 5 for a continuing increase of the mesh resolution the information of converged mesh is briefly summarized as follows horizontally the number of cells is 4800 which is uniformly distributed i e the cell length is 0 0025 m vertically the mesh is uniformly distributed with the cell height of 0 0025m the number of cells is related to the value of b 0 for z 0 1 m while for 0 1 z 0 3 m the number of cells is 32 with a stretch ratio of 5 2 2 shallow water equations by assuming a shallow water condition and ignoring the friction on the bed and the energy loss at the bottom step an analytical solution can be derived for dam break flow over a bottom step based on the shallow water equations swes due to the existence of the bottom step i e a discontinuous variation of bottom surface see fig 2 the mass energy formulations instead of the conventional mass momentum formulations are used to describe the water flow in eqs 5 and 6 alcrudo and benkhaldoun 2001 5 h z b t h z b u x 0 6 u g t h u 2 2 g x 0 where h and z b are the vertical coordinates of water and bottom surfaces respectively the hugoniot condition leveque 2002 at the bottom step i e a stationary discontinuity leads to the relations 7 h z b u x 0 h z b u x 0 8 h u 2 2 g x 0 h u 2 2 g x 0 as shown in fig 2b the riemann solution structure of the bottom step model is a combination of rarefaction waves the stationary jump located at the bottom step and constant flow regions in between them according to the definition in fig 2b eqs 7 and 8 can be re written as follows 9 u 2 h 2 u 3 h 3 10 u 2 2 2 g h 2 b 0 u 3 2 2 g h 3 the flow state h 3 u 3 t is regarded as critical because i it is located at the upper vertex of the bottom step a transition position from subcritical at left of the bottom step to supercritical flow at right of the bottom step and ii it is consistent with the classical dam break solution if b 0 0 the critical condition of the flow state h 3 u 3 t gives the following relation 11 u 3 g h 3 1 the riemann constant corresponding to the rarefaction wave that connects the flow state h 1 u 1 t u 1 0 for the present case and h 2 u 2 t leads to the following relation 12 u 2 2 g h 2 2 g h 1 the implicit equation for the water depth h 2 is derived from eqs 9 12 as follows the detailed derivation is shown in appendix a 13 4 h 1 h 2 2 h 2 2 8 27 h 2 b 0 2 h 1 h 2 2 3 0 equation 13 is numerically solved using the newton raphson method after that the values of h 2 u 2 and h 3 can be obtained the rarefaction wave at the left of the bottom step is bounded by the points a and b see fig 2b whose horizontal coordinates x a and x b are given respectively as follows 14 x a 2 g h 1 t x b u 2 2 g h 2 t the horizontal velocity u and water level h on the horizontal bed at the right of the bottom step is given by eqs 15 and 16 15 u g h 3 2 3 x t 16 h 1 9 g 3 g h 3 x t 2 the horizontal momentum flux of water flow on the right bottom is given by 17 m b d u 2 h 1 9 g g h 3 2 3 x t 2 3 g h 3 x t 2 from eq 17 the maximum horizontal momentum flux is calculated as follows 18 m ˆ b d m a x 81 64 g h 3 2 occuring at x t 3 4 g h 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 water profile of dam break flow fig 3 presents some snapshots of water profiles for a dam break model with a bottom step the results derived from both cfd simulations and analytical solutions see section 2 are put together for comparison overall the agreement is reasonable on the water profiles of dam break flow at the region where x 0 m however near the bottom step i e x 0 the agreement is less satisfactory the analytical solution based on shallow water assumption indicates a fixed discontinuity of water height at x 0 while the cfd simulation presents a smooth transition although the rate of drop of water height is also large it can be seen from fig 3 that the sharp drop of water height for the cfd simulation is restricted within the range of x 0 2 m outside which the water level varies slowly the difference of water profiles near the bottom step between analytical solution and cfd simulation may be attributable to the fact that the former ignores the non hydrostatic i e non shallow condition near the bottom step as shown in fig 4 due to the blockage of water flow by the vertical face of the bottom step the vertical component of velocity is significant near the bottom step resulting in the formation of vortices seemingly attached to the horizontal bottom near the step 3 2 horizontal momentum flux of dam break flow the horizontal momentum flux of dam break flow is related to the impact force on tall thin structures and also broad vertical plate type structures provided the froude number of shallow water flow is large such that the impact force is dominated by horizontal momentum flux instead of hydrostatic pressure in cases where hydrostatic pressure is important combined knowledge of flow rate and momentum flux also enable estimates of horizontal force the procedure for calculating the maximum horizontal momentum flux in cfd simulations is given as follows first a probe is set at a given position x to monitor the horizontal momentum flux at the time instant t the horizontal momentum flux is calculated by m b d x t 0 h α u 2 d z where h is the upper limit of the integration i e the length of the probe and should be larger than the maximum water depth at this position by placing a set of probes on the right side of the bottom step the maximum horizontal momentum flux in space at the time instant t is given as m b d m a x t max x m b d x t then the maximum horizontal momentum flux in both space and time is calculated as m ˆ b d m a x max t m b d m a x t fig 5a presents an example of the variation of the maximum horizontal momentum flux in space m b d m a x and its corresponding location x 0 with respect to time t when t 0 56 s the location corresponding to m b d m a x is near the bottom step i e x 0 and the maximum horizontal momentum flux in space m b d m a x presents some irregular oscillating features for example for 0 2 s t 0 56 s the value of m b d m a x bears two bumps and this value occurs at location of the bottom step i e x 0 0 the reason may be explained as follows the value of m b d m a x is determined by both the water height and horizontal velocity in the initial dam break stage the water flow in shallow water region has not yet fully developed and thus the non hydrostatic region bears a larger horizontal momentum flux due to a larger water height consequently the maximum horizontal momentum flux may occur near the location of the bottom step as this position is characterized by the largest water height the irregular oscillating feature i e bumps may be due to the formation of vortices near the bottom step see fig 4 however in the later stage the maximum horizontal momentum flux in space m b d m a x varies smoothly first increasing and then decreasing with respect to time the location x 0 moves downward with almost a constant speed of 0 6 m s a similar feature indicated by the analytical solution in section 2 2 see eq 18 this is close to the speed predicted by eq 18 i e 0 55 m s the difference is within 10 it is observed that the variation of x 0 with respect to time shows step wise characteristics this step wise feature may be caused by the finite number of probes for monitoring the horizontal momentum flux placed on the right side of the bottom step in cfd simulation rather than the simulation itself see fig 6 although theoretically the value of x 0 increases smoothly and continuously with respect to time see eq 18 as shown in fig 6 for cfd simulations the value of x 0 can only be measured on the discretely distributed probes as a result the value of x 0 between two probes for some time steps in cfd is numerically measured on either of the two probes leading to the step wise feature of the variation of x 0 shown in fig 5 the maximum value of m b d m a x in this smooth stage is denoted as m ˆ b d m a x which is actually the maximum horizontal momentum flux in both space and time fig 5b summarizes the variation of m ˆ b d m a x normalized by the classical dam break solution with b 0 0 i e 0 25 g h 0 2 with respect to different values of bottom step level it can be seen that the cfd simulation and analytical solution show a similar trend that the maximum horizontal momentum flux increases with the increase of bottom step level although cfd results are smaller than analytical ones the difference of results within 10 for the cases considered obtained by two approaches may be due to the energy loss caused by the formation of vorticity near the bottom step see fig 4 compared with the classical dam break model i e bottom step level is zero the dam break model with a bottom step bears a larger horizontal momentum flux or equivalently impact loading the normalized maximum horizontal momentum flux increases rapidly with the increase of bottom step for small bottom step levels while becomes less sensitive for large bottom step levels similarly for greenwater overtopping of a ship the variation of water level near the ship front leads to the maximum horizontal momentum flux impact loading of on deck flow under estimated by the classical dam break model see fig 15 in zhang et al 2019 3 3 a physical explanation of the bottom step effect in this section the analytical solution given in section 2 2 is used to explain why the introduction of bottom step leads to the increase of horizontal momentum flux of dam break flow as shown in fig 2b the water volume w2 on the right bottom comes from the water volume w1 in the upstream region i e w2 w1 if h 0 is fixed the increase of the bottom step level b 0 will lead to the increase of the propagation speed of the rarefaction wave in the upstream region u a g h 1 g h 0 b 0 as shown in fig 7 for the flow state h 2 u 2 t the contribution of the velocity to the total hydraulic head can be neglected in comparison with the contribution of the water depth for a large value of b 0 h 0 thus eq 10 may be simplified in combination with eq 11 as 19 h 2 b 0 1 5 h 3 three possible conditions may exist for the variation of h 2 b 0 or the vertical level of the point c in fig 2b i e decreasing being unchanged or increasing with the increase of the bottom step level if h 2 b 0 decreases or is unchanged the water volume w1 will increase due to both the increase of u a as we assume the bottom step level b 0 increases the length of a f also becomes larger and the drop or fixity of the point c in which the length of c f becomes larger or unchanged however the value of h 3 decreases or is unchanged according to eq 19 which leads to the volume w2 decreasing or being unchanged this is contradictory thus the value of h 2 b 0 as well as h 3 should increase with the increase of the bottom step level causing an increase in momentum flux on the right bottom as indicated by eq 18 briefly speaking the rarefaction wave associated with the draw down of upstream water of the dam travels faster with a larger bottom step level consequently the fluid contributing to the runout of water over dry bed can be drawn from a larger region upstream of the dam resulting in on average a larger water level just upstream of the dam compared to the flat bed geometry this larger water level helps to drive increased horizontal momentum flux the relation between the propagation speed of the rarefaction wave in the upstream region and the bottom step level i e u a g h 1 g h 0 b 0 also indicates that u a increases rapidly with the increase of bottom step level b 0 when b 0 is small while becomes less sensitive to b 0 for large b 0 this helps explain the trend that the effect of bottom step level on the maximum horizontal momentum flux is more significant for small values of bottom step level see fig 5b 4 conclusions both the computational fluid dynamics and shallow water equations methods are used to solve the dam break flow over a horizontal bed with a bottom step the horizontal momentum flux of dam break flow representative of impact loading on vertical plate type structures is of special interest it is observed for we believe the first time that the introduction of bottom step in dam break model increases the maximum horizontal momentum flux of water flow being larger than that of classical dam break model this trend can be attributed to the fact that the rarefaction wave associated with draw down of water upstream of the dam travels faster with a bottom step the mathematical model proposed in section 2 especially eq 18 may give a quantitative prediction of the bottom step effect on the dam break flow this bottom step dam break model helps explain why the classical dam break model underpredicts the horizontal momentum flux of greenwater flow for large relative overtopping duration indicated by zhang et al 2019 see fig 15 in the reference however further work needs to link this bottom step dam break model back to greenwater problem one of such efforts is to define the appropriate equivalent bottom step level from the real greenwater problem moreover it is also worth exploring how this bottom step effect may be coupled with other effects such as the finite overtopping duration and the motion of ships or platforms credit authorship contribution statement xiantao zhang conceptualization methodology formal analysis writing

21589,dam break flow over the horizontal bed with a bottom step is solved using both computational fluid dynamics and shallow water equation models the bottom step is a scenario related to greenwater overtopping of offshore structures in which a sharp variation of water depth exists from the location in front of the ship to the position on deck the effect of bottom step level on the horizontal momentum flux of dam break flow representative of its impact loading on plate type structures is investigated both these models predict a trend that the increase of bottom step level leads to an increase of the maximum horizontal momentum flux being larger than that of the classical dam break solution the increasing rate is large for a small bottom step level but becomes less sensitive for a large bottom step level this trend can be attributed to the fact that the rarefaction wave associated with draw down of water upstream of the dam travels faster with a bottom step keywords dam break bottom step greenwater overtopping horizontal momentum flux 1 introduction dam break flow occurs when a column of water is released by the sudden removal of a vertical barrier the simplest dam break model is the classical one described by ritter 1892 in which a semi infinite block of water initially at rest collapses onto a horizontal dry bed an analytical solution of water height and horizontal velocity is given by assuming shallow water condition and ignoring the non hydrostatic flow at the initial stage of dam break stansby et al 1998 since then this type of shallow gravity driven flow with different levels of complexity has been extensively investigated because of its wide application in marine hydrodynamics and coastal engineering a frequent application scenario of dam break flow is to be acted as a simplified prediction model of greenwater overtopping of offshore structures greenwater overtopping is an extreme event in harsh sea conditions in which a compact mass of water exceeds the freeboard and overtops onto the deck buchner 1995 chen et al 2019 this event has been a critical issue in safe operation and structural integrity of offshore facilities due to its damage to the deck superstructures and the equipment on deck ersdal and kvitrud 2000 faulkner 2002 the similarity between dam break flow and greenwater overtopping flow has been investigated and demonstrated by some researchers ryu et al 2007 greco et al 2005 2007 hernández fontes et al 2019 the classical dam break solution due to ritter 1892 is used to estimate greenwater flow on deck given an initial dam height based on some calculation in the fluid domain surrounding the vessel however obvious discrepancies can be observed for this prediction model in some overtopping scenarios because of some physics inherent in greenwater but ignored in the classical dam break model schoenberg and rainey 2002 for example buchner 1999 argued that the initial dam height should be 9 4 times the observed freeboard exceedance contrastingly faltinsen et al 2002 took the dam height as the observed freeboard exceedance but adjusted the time instant of the dam break for each individual event consequently some researchers have improved the classical dam break model by accounting for its physical differences with greenwater overtopping flow schønberg and rainey 2002 for example developed a potential flow model to simulate a shelf moving up and down in calm water with which the effect of the finite duration of freeboard exceedance was studied it was found that the finite duration reduces the horizontal momentum flux predicted by the classical dam break solution zhang et al 2019 further proposed a modified dam break model to incorporate the effect of overtopping duration based on which a non dimensional parameter the relative duration i e a combination of freeboard exceedance and overtopping duration is found to be a good indicator of severity of greenwater events the model of dam break with initial velocity is developed and simulated using computational fluid dynamics cfd by pham and varyani 2005 who found that this new model performed better than classical dam break model in predicting the horizontal loading of greenwater flow hernández fontes et al 2018 developed a wet dam break model to replace the incoming waves to generate different overtopping events apart from above mentioned modifications in classical dam break model another physical difference between dam break and greenwater which may lack sufficient investigations is the local geometry at the ship front i e a sharp variation of water depth from the location in front of the ship to the position on deck zhang et al 2019 to account for this effect a bottom step is introduced at the location of the dam for the classical dam break model in the present study there are a few studies on dam break flow over a bottom step most of which focus on determining the riemann solution structure of this discontinuous shallow water flow alcrudo and benkhaldoun 2001 ostapenko 2003 alcrudo and benkhaldoun 2001 presented a set of riemann solutions to the one dimensional shallow water equations swes with a bottom step discontinuity these solutions are derived from an initial wet bed condition with horizontal velocities i e both sides of the bottom step have an initial water depth larger than zero and with the assumption of no energy loss at the bottom step ostapenko 2003 focused on a particular case of those studied by alcrudo and benkhaldoun 2001 in which a static wet bed on both sides of the bottom step initial condition was considered the main efforts were focused on the proof of the solvability of the shallow water problem these previous studies provide some insights for the dam break problem with a bottom step however in the context of greenwater overtopping there are some gaps to be filled in first previous studies are mainly focused on the two side wet bed initial conditions whereas a similar scenario with greenwater overtopping requires the initial condition for bottom step dam break flow to be wet bed at one side of the bottom step corresponding to the zone in front of a ship and dry bed at the other side corresponding to the on deck region second there is a lack of comparisons of swe solutions to the bottom step dam break problem against experimental data or other advanced numerical results such as cfd simulations especially in the case that energy loss is ignored in swe solutions third it has not been clarified how the dam break flow is affected by the bottom step especially for some important physical quantities related to impact loading therefore in the present study both cfd and swes models are developed to solve this problem aiming to identify how the bottom step alters the dam break flow and in a further step explore the underlying physics causing such changes the remainder of the paper is organized as follows mathematical models including both cfd and swes are introduced in section 2 numerical results and relevant discussions are presented in section 3 the main conclusions are drawn in section 4 2 mathematical model 2 1 computational fluid dynamics a schematic of the computational fluid dynamics cfd model for a 2d dam break flow with a bottom step is shown in fig 1 a cartesian coordinate system x z is adopted with positive x being right and positive z being upward the origin of the coordinate system is set at the upper vertex of the step the depth of the step is b 0 the bottom for the region x 0 is set to be flat at z b 0 the initial water height at rest in the upstream region i e x 0 is set to be h 0 b 0 the downstream region at x 0 is characterized by an initially dry horizontal bed the problem is modelled using the two phase incompressible navier stokes equations 1 u 0 2 t ρ u ρ u u t p t ρ f b 3 t α u α 0 where eqs 1 3 represent the combined conservation of mass of two phases water and air the conservation of momentum and the conservation of the mass of the individual phases respectively α x z t 0 1 is the phase fraction of water with α 1 denoting pure water α 0 pure air and 0 α 1 a linearly weighted mixture of water and air here t is the time the velocity field for water and air is denoted as u u x z t w x z t t where the superscript t represents the transpose of the vector or matrix ρ x z t is the density t x z t is the viscous stress tensor and f b x z t 0 g is the external force due to gravity with g 9 81 m s 2 being the constant of gravitational acceleration the viscous stress tensor in eq 2 is given as follows 4 t μ u u t where μ is the dynamic viscosity the term shown in eq 4 causes the mechanical energy to be dissipated into heat due to internal viscous forces batchelor 2000 as the water and air are modelled as incompressible the density and viscosity of a fluid volume are calculated using the weighted arithmetic average of the water and air components i e ρ ρ w α ρ a 1 α and μ μ w α μ a 1 α where the subscripts w and a denote water and air phases respectively the material constants are set to their respective values at atmospheric pressure and 20 c ρ w 1000 k g m 3 ρ a 1 225 k g

volume of fluid vof surface capturing scheme for the cfd simulation see fig 1 the length l 0 and height h 0 of the initial water column is set to l 0 6 m and h 0 0 1 m the remaining region of the computational domain is characterized by l 1 6 m and h a 0 2 m a set of different values of b 0 i e b 0 h 0 0 5 1 1 5 2 3 5 7 10 15 20 are adopted in order to investigate its effect on the dam break flow characteristics although here the ratio b 0 h 0 is varied by fixing the value of h 0 and varying b 0 it has been proved in appendix b that a given b 0 h 0 whatever values of h 0 and b 0 corresponds to a unique value of normalized physical quantities for example the normalized horizontal momentum flux shown in fig 5b theoretically the length l 0 should be infinitely large to match the assumption made in the analytical solution in section 2 2 however in cfd simulation l 0 6 m is chosen based on the observation that the dam break flow is not affected by choosing a larger value of l 0 it is noted that a small value of l 0 may have an effect as the rarefaction wave its propagation speed is indicated by eq 14 may reach the left boundary before shallow water dam break flow is fully developed in cfd simulation i e when the maximum horizontal momentum flux is reached similar discussions on the effect of the length l 0 have been conducted for dam break flow with finite duration effect in zhang et al 2019 mesh convergence has been conducted although not shown here briefly speaking both the water height and horizontal momentum flux the definition is given in section 3 2 are used as the indicators for convergence the mesh is considered to be converged if the difference of the physical quantities is within 5 for a continuing increase of the mesh resolution the information of converged mesh is briefly summarized as follows horizontally the number of cells is 4800 which is uniformly distributed i e the cell length is 0 0025 m vertically the mesh is uniformly distributed with the cell height of 0 0025m the number of cells is related to the value of b 0 for z 0 1 m while for 0 1 z 0 3 m the number of cells is 32 with a stretch ratio of 5 2 2 shallow water equations by assuming a shallow water condition and ignoring the friction on the bed and the energy loss at the bottom step an analytical solution can be derived for dam break flow over a bottom step based on the shallow water equations swes due to the existence of the bottom step i e a discontinuous variation of bottom surface see fig 2 the mass energy formulations instead of the conventional mass momentum formulations are used to describe the water flow in eqs 5 and 6 alcrudo and benkhaldoun 2001 5 h z b t h z b u x 0 6 u g t h u 2 2 g x 0 where h and z b are the vertical coordinates of water and bottom surfaces respectively the hugoniot condition leveque 2002 at the bottom step i e a stationary discontinuity leads to the relations 7 h z b u x 0 h z b u x 0 8 h u 2 2 g x 0 h u 2 2 g x 0 as shown in fig 2b the riemann solution structure of the bottom step model is a combination of rarefaction waves the stationary jump located at the bottom step and constant flow regions in between them according to the definition in fig 2b eqs 7 and 8 can be re written as follows 9 u 2 h 2 u 3 h 3 10 u 2 2 2 g h 2 b 0 u 3 2 2 g h 3 the flow state h 3 u 3 t is regarded as critical because i it is located at the upper vertex of the bottom step a transition position from subcritical at left of the bottom step to supercritical flow at right of the bottom step and ii it is consistent with the classical dam break solution if b 0 0 the critical condition of the flow state h 3 u 3 t gives the following relation 11 u 3 g h 3 1 the riemann constant corresponding to the rarefaction wave that connects the flow state h 1 u 1 t u 1 0 for the present case and h 2 u 2 t leads to the following relation 12 u 2 2 g h 2 2 g h 1 the implicit equation for the water depth h 2 is derived from eqs 9 12 as follows the detailed derivation is shown in appendix a 13 4 h 1 h 2 2 h 2 2 8 27 h 2 b 0 2 h 1 h 2 2 3 0 equation 13 is numerically solved using the newton raphson method after that the values of h 2 u 2 and h 3 can be obtained the rarefaction wave at the left of the bottom step is bounded by the points a and b see fig 2b whose horizontal coordinates x a and x b are given respectively as follows 14 x a 2 g h 1 t x b u 2 2 g h 2 t the horizontal velocity u and water level h on the horizontal bed at the right of the bottom step is given by eqs 15 and 16 15 u g h 3 2 3 x t 16 h 1 9 g 3 g h 3 x t 2 the horizontal momentum flux of water flow on the right bottom is given by 17 m b d u 2 h 1 9 g g h 3 2 3 x t 2 3 g h 3 x t 2 from eq 17 the maximum horizontal momentum flux is calculated as follows 18 m ˆ b d m a x 81 64 g h 3 2 occuring at x t 3 4 g h 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 water profile of dam break flow fig 3 presents some snapshots of water profiles for a dam break model with a bottom step the results derived from both cfd simulations and analytical solutions see section 2 are put together for comparison overall the agreement is reasonable on the water profiles of dam break flow at the region where x 0 m however near the bottom step i e x 0 the agreement is less satisfactory the analytical solution based on shallow water assumption indicates a fixed discontinuity of water height at x 0 while the cfd simulation presents a smooth transition although the rate of drop of water height is also large it can be seen from fig 3 that the sharp drop of water height for the cfd simulation is restricted within the range of x 0 2 m outside which the water level varies slowly the difference of water profiles near the bottom step between analytical solution and cfd simulation may be attributable to the fact that the former ignores the non hydrostatic i e non shallow condition near the bottom step as shown in fig 4 due to the blockage of water flow by the vertical face of the bottom step the vertical component of velocity is significant near the bottom step resulting in the formation of vortices seemingly attached to the horizontal bottom near the step 3 2 horizontal momentum flux of dam break flow the horizontal momentum flux of dam break flow is related to the impact force on tall thin structures and also broad vertical plate type structures provided the froude number of shallow water flow is large such that the impact force is dominated by horizontal momentum flux instead of hydrostatic pressure in cases where hydrostatic pressure is important combined knowledge of flow rate and momentum flux also enable estimates of horizontal force the procedure for calculating the maximum horizontal momentum flux in cfd simulations is given as follows first a probe is set at a given position x to monitor the horizontal momentum flux at the time instant t the horizontal momentum flux is calculated by m b d x t 0 h α u 2 d z where h is the upper limit of the integration i e the length of the probe and should be larger than the maximum water depth at this position by placing a set of probes on the right side of the bottom step the maximum horizontal momentum flux in space at the time instant t is given as m b d m a x t max x m b d x t then the maximum horizontal momentum flux in both space and time is calculated as m ˆ b d m a x max t m b d m a x t fig 5a presents an example of the variation of the maximum horizontal momentum flux in space m b d m a x and its corresponding location x 0 with respect to time t when t 0 56 s the location corresponding to m b d m a x is near the bottom step i e x 0 and the maximum horizontal momentum flux in space m b d m a x presents some irregular oscillating features for example for 0 2 s t 0 56 s the value of m b d m a x bears two bumps and this value occurs at location of the bottom step i e x 0 0 the reason may be explained as follows the value of m b d m a x is determined by both the water height and horizontal velocity in the initial dam break stage the water flow in shallow water region has not yet fully developed and thus the non hydrostatic region bears a larger horizontal momentum flux due to a larger water height consequently the maximum horizontal momentum flux may occur near the location of the bottom step as this position is characterized by the largest water height the irregular oscillating feature i e bumps may be due to the formation of vortices near the bottom step see fig 4 however in the later stage the maximum horizontal momentum flux in space m b d m a x varies smoothly first increasing and then decreasing with respect to time the location x 0 moves downward with almost a constant speed of 0 6 m s a similar feature indicated by the analytical solution in section 2 2 see eq 18 this is close to the speed predicted by eq 18 i e 0 55 m s the difference is within 10 it is observed that the variation of x 0 with respect to time shows step wise characteristics this step wise feature may be caused by the finite number of probes for monitoring the horizontal momentum flux placed on the right side of the bottom step in cfd simulation rather than the simulation itself see fig 6 although theoretically the value of x 0 increases smoothly and continuously with respect to time see eq 18 as shown in fig 6 for cfd simulations the value of x 0 can only be measured on the discretely distributed probes as a result the value of x 0 between two probes for some time steps in cfd is numerically measured on either of the two probes leading to the step wise feature of the variation of x 0 shown in fig 5 the maximum value of m b d m a x in this smooth stage is denoted as m ˆ b d m a x which is actually the maximum horizontal momentum flux in both space and time fig 5b summarizes the variation of m ˆ b d m a x normalized by the classical dam break solution with b 0 0 i e 0 25 g h 0 2 with respect to different values of bottom step level it can be seen that the cfd simulation and analytical solution show a similar trend that the maximum horizontal momentum flux increases with the increase of bottom step level although cfd results are smaller than analytical ones the difference of results within 10 for the cases considered obtained by two approaches may be due to the energy loss caused by the formation of vorticity near the bottom step see fig 4 compared with the classical dam break model i e bottom step level is zero the dam break model with a bottom step bears a larger horizontal momentum flux or equivalently impact loading the normalized maximum horizontal momentum flux increases rapidly with the increase of bottom step for small bottom step levels while becomes less sensitive for large bottom step levels similarly for greenwater overtopping of a ship the variation of water level near the ship front leads to the maximum horizontal momentum flux impact loading of on deck flow under estimated by the classical dam break model see fig 15 in zhang et al 2019 3 3 a physical explanation of the bottom step effect in this section the analytical solution given in section 2 2 is used to explain why the introduction of bottom step leads to the increase of horizontal momentum flux of dam break flow as shown in fig 2b the water volume w2 on the right bottom comes from the water volume w1 in the upstream region i e w2 w1 if h 0 is fixed the increase of the bottom step level b 0 will lead to the increase of the propagation speed of the rarefaction wave in the upstream region u a g h 1 g h 0 b 0 as shown in fig 7 for the flow state h 2 u 2 t the contribution of the velocity to the total hydraulic head can be neglected in comparison with the contribution of the water depth for a large value of b 0 h 0 thus eq 10 may be simplified in combination with eq 11 as 19 h 2 b 0 1 5 h 3 three possible conditions may exist for the variation of h 2 b 0 or the vertical level of the point c in fig 2b i e decreasing being unchanged or increasing with the increase of the bottom step level if h 2 b 0 decreases or is unchanged the water volume w1 will increase due to both the increase of u a as we assume the bottom step level b 0 increases the length of a f also becomes larger and the drop or fixity of the point c in which the length of c f becomes larger or unchanged however the value of h 3 decreases or is unchanged according to eq 19 which leads to the volume w2 decreasing or being unchanged this is contradictory thus the value of h 2 b 0 as well as h 3 should increase with the increase of the bottom step level causing an increase in momentum flux on the right bottom as indicated by eq 18 briefly speaking the rarefaction wave associated with the draw down of upstream water of the dam travels faster with a larger bottom step level consequently the fluid contributing to the runout of water over dry bed can be drawn from a larger region upstream of the dam resulting in on average a larger water level just upstream of the dam compared to the flat bed geometry this larger water level helps to drive increased horizontal momentum flux the relation between the propagation speed of the rarefaction wave in the upstream region and the bottom step level i e u a g h 1 g h 0 b 0 also indicates that u a increases rapidly with the increase of bottom step level b 0 when b 0 is small while becomes less sensitive to b 0 for large b 0 this helps explain the trend that the effect of bottom step level on the maximum horizontal momentum flux is more significant for small values of bottom step level see fig 5b 4 conclusions both the computational fluid dynamics and shallow water equations methods are used to solve the dam break flow over a horizontal bed with a bottom step the horizontal momentum flux of dam break flow representative of impact loading on vertical plate type structures is of special interest it is observed for we believe the first time that the introduction of bottom step in dam break model increases the maximum horizontal momentum flux of water flow being larger than that of classical dam break model this trend can be attributed to the fact that the rarefaction wave associated with draw down of water upstream of the dam travels faster with a bottom step the mathematical model proposed in section 2 especially eq 18 may give a quantitative prediction of the bottom step effect on the dam break flow this bottom step dam break model helps explain why the classical dam break model underpredicts the horizontal momentum flux of greenwater flow for large relative overtopping duration indicated by zhang et al 2019 see fig 15 in the reference however further work needs to link this bottom step dam break model back to greenwater problem one of such efforts is to define the appropriate equivalent bottom step level from the real greenwater problem moreover it is also worth exploring how this bottom step effect may be coupled with other effects such as the finite overtopping duration and the motion of ships or platforms credit authorship contribution statement xiantao zhang conceptualization methodology formal analysis writing
