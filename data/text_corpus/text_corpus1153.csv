fluctuation amplitude thus we hypothesized that riparian denitrification was enhanced under hydrological regulations following hydropower production creating eutrophication self mitigation in reservoirs in this study riparian denitrification at the land water interface was studied in a hydropower reservoir on the mainstream of the upper mekong river which has been heavily dammed for hydropower production spatial patterns of denitrification were analyzed across the riparian zone and the relationship between denitrification and water level rising falling cycle was established hyporheic exchanges in the riparian zone were also studied to clarify the impacts of interment floods on the availability of organic carbon for denitrification the objective of this study was to explore riparian denitrification at the land water interface under hydrological regulations following hydropower production which advances our knowledge on environmental impacts of hydropower

by land runoff bettez and groffman 2012 hall jr et al 2009 shuai et al 2017 in this study we selected a riparian zone on an island inside manwan reservoir on the upper mekong river the riparian zone on the island experiences frequent wetting drying cycles due to water level fluctuations but is not directly disturbed by riverbank runoff thus providing a unique experimental field site to study the precise impacts of hydrological regulations by hydropower production on riparian denitrification the island 24 43 44 n 100 23 5 e is located 30 km from the manwan dam fig 1 a manwan is the first built completed in 1993 hydropower reservoir on the mainstream of the upper mekong river with a total storage capacity of 9 2 108 m3 and an installed capacity of 1750 mw zhao et al 2013 the island is oval

height an inlet and a one way outlet during the process of water level rising water flows into the system when the level reaches the inlet during the water level dropping water flows out through the one way valve the difference in inlet height creates different periods of wetting drying cycle thus the wetting drying cycle with different periods can be simultaneously simulated at the same site to minimize the disturbances caused by sediment heterogeneity the controlled experimental systems and their island layouts are shown in fig 2 the experiment was conducted over nine months from march to

bottle over incubation time and sediment density the denitrifiers in the sediments were quantified using quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr there are many functioning genes in the denitrification process shrewsbury et al 2016 of which nirs for encoding nitric oxide reductase and nosz for encoding nitrous oxide reductase are the most common gene markers for denitrifiers guo et

oxide fluxes at the 10 sampling sites were analyzed using the static chamber method after the water level receded based on the concentration changes over time in the chamber headspace beaulieu et al 2010 duchemin et al 1999 the plexiglass chamber was a 6 28 l cylinder 20 cm diameter 20 cm height covered with mylar paper to prevent temperature rise inside when exposed to the sun a collar was

fluctuations in the reservoir following hydropower production the water levels fluctuated frequently within the range of 4 67 m to 1 69 m yielding a maximum oscillation of 6 36 m fig 3 a the fft analysis indicated that there was a dominant period of approximately 7 8 d in the water level fluctuations fig 3b in contrast the water level exhibited an annual pattern with a period of 365 d fig 3c prior to the construction of manwan dam 3 2 groundwater level fluctuations and hyporheic exchanges in the riparian zone as water level fluctuated in the reservoir similar oscillations were observed in the island groundwater but were relatively damped and lagged fig 4 a during the 72 h observation period the maximum oscillation in the reservoir s5 s7 and s10 reached 2 10 1 44 1 31 and 0 99 m respectively data from water level recorders indicated that water level responses in s5 s7 and s10 lagged the reservoir by 20 25 and 30 min respectively according to the darcy law hyporheic exchanges across the island bank were largest at the island edge and decreased from the edge to the center the hyporheic flow rates at the reservoir s5 s5 s7 and s7 s10 zones maintained at 4 77 10 3 9 14 10 3 m2 d 1 8 11 10 3 2 46 10 3 and 3 94 10 3 2 26 10 3 m2 d 1 over the 72 h observation period fig 4b 3 3 sediment denitrification potential nitrous oxide flux and dissolved nitrate concentration the obtained results showed that denitrification was generally more active in the surface sediment than in the subsurface sediment but exhibited significant spatial heterogeneity across the island fig 5 from the island edge to the center the denitrification potential rate in the surface sediment increased from 51 9 10 3 g m 2d 1 at site s1 to 105 5 10 3 g m 2 d 1 at site s5 followed by a reduction below 13 4 10 3 g m 2 d 1 for sites s8 s10 fig 5a however the denitrification potential rate in the subsurface remained consistently low at 2 2 26 4 g m 2 d 1 nitrous oxide flux across the sampling sites showed a similar pattern as surface sediment denitrification i e increased from 1 93 10 3 g m 2 d 1 at s1 to 2 34 10 3 g m 2 d 1 at s5 and then decreased to 0 01 10 3 g m 2 d 1 at site s10 the nitrate concentration in the groundwater was below the detection limit 0 02 mg n l 1 for stations s1 s8 but reached 0 04 0 07 mg n l 1 at sites s9 s10 fig 5a the controlled field experiments indicated that there was a strong negative logarithmic relationship between the denitrification rate and the period of wetting drying cycle r2 0 98 p 0 01 fig 5b 3 4 dissolved organic carbon the doc content in the groundwater showed a significant lateral gradient across the island p 0 05 but higher than the adjacent reservoir from the island edge to the center the doc decreased from 7 3 mg l 1 at s1 to 1 7 mg l 1 at s10 while was only 1 4 mg l 1 in the adjacent reservoir fig 6 moreover the percentage of doc to total organic carbon in sediment also showed a general decreasing trend from 49 1 at the island edge to 17 6 at the center fig 6 3 5 denitrifier abundance generally denitrifier counts were abundant in the surface sediment 0 10 cm while were rare in the subsurface layer 10 20 cm of the island in the surface sediment denitrifiers were distributed non uniformly across sampling sites showing a peak between the edge and the center fig 7 a and b the nirs gene increased from 1 0 106 copies g 1 at s1 to 1 7 106 copies g 1 at s6 and then decreased to 3 0 103 copies g 1 at s10 however the gene was below 0 6 106 copies g 1 in the subsurface sediment across all sites fig 7a similarly the nosz gene increased from 0 9 106 copies g 1 at s1 to 1 5 106 copies g 1 at s5 and then decreased to 0 3 106 copies g 1 at s10 however the gene below 5 1 105 copies g 1 in the subsurface sediment across all sites fig 7b 4 discussion in reservoirs water storage and release occur frequently for hydropower production francis et al 2010 holzapfel et al 2017 such operations accelerate water level fluctuations compared to natural rivers kolbjørn jensen et al 2017 and thus generate frequent wet dry cycles at the riparian zone at the water land interface zhu et al 2013 during the process of water storage the riparian zone is in an anoxic state followed by a shift back to an aerobic state as oxygen penetrates the sediment during water release blackburn et al 2017 which have been found to favor denitrification in riparian zones ranalli and macalady 2010 wang et al 2018 in the current study we found that the denitrification potential rate at the upslope edge of the riparian zone was higher than at the edge zone near the reservoir fig 5 as the former was exposed to more frequent wetting drying cycles the denitrification potential rate was lowest at the island center fig 5 where floods seldom reached as a result groundwater nitrate was consumed and its concentration fell below the detection limit 0 02 mg n l 1 whereas large amounts of nitrous oxide were produced and emitted at a high rate of 1 93 2 34 10 3 g m 2 d 1 across the entire riparian zone in contrast the concentration of groundwater nitrate reached 0 04 0 07 mg n l 1 and the nitrous oxide flux was below 0 01 10 3 g m 2d 1 at the island center fig 5 we also observed that the pattern of denitrifier distribution fig 7 was generally similar to that of denitrification activity fig 5a along the transect organic carbon serves to satisfy energy demands of heterotrophic bacteria to maintain life sobczak et al 2003 zarnetske et al 2011 the majority of denitrifiers are facultative anaerobic heterotrophs which are limited by the availability of organic carbon sobczak et al 2003 von der heide et al 2008 zarnetske et al 2011 zarnetske et al 2011 reported that the rate of denitrification in riparian zones can more than double under elevated doc conditions as water level fluctuated in the reservoir a hysteretic response occurred in groundwater level in the island fig 4a creating hydraulic heads and driving hyporheic exchanges between the reservoir and island hyporheic exchanges were strongest close to the island edge and decreased from the edge to the center with the attenuation of groundwater level fluctuations fig 4b these strong hyporheic exchanges at the island edge can accelerate doc mineralization thereby increasing doc supply wilson et al 2013 we detected a higher concentration of doc and higher percentage of doc to total organic carbon in sediment at the island edge than at the center fig 6 which would supply sufficient carbon to fuel active denitrification at the island edge moreover alternate wetting drying may produce the biosimulation effect on denitrifiers contributing to the spatial heterogeneity of denitrification across the riparian zone this needs to further study the responses of denitrifier activities to alternate wetting drying using other techniques such as dna rna based stable isotope probing dumont and murrell 2005 in unregulated river systems with natural flow regimes hydrological processes within hyporheic zones at the land water interface usually exhibit annual patterns with the period of t 365 d as observed in the current study before impoundment fig 3c after impoundment however water level fluctuations have accelerated increasing the occurrence of denitrification as found in the relationship between k t and t fig 5b moreover after impoundment the normal water level increased and usually the slope of the riparian zone ɵ decreased enlarging the hot spot areas for denitrification under the same water level fluctuation amplitude to show the impacts of impoundment and flow regulation on the riparian denitrification in reservoirs a conceptual formula was proposed as r k t δ h sin θ where r is the nitrogen removal rate per unit by riparian denitrification g m 1d 1 k t is the denitrification rate as a function of t g m 2d 1 t is the period of wetting drying cycle d δh is the amplitude of water level fluctuation m ɵ is the slop of the riparian zone as shown in the formula the accelerated water level fluctuation t as well as the enlarged hot spot areas ɵ jointly enhanced the riparian denitrification at the land water interface in the reservoir however further studies are needed to calibrate the coefficients of the formula by collecting sufficient field data this study demonstrated that river damming and hydropower production enlarged hot spots and increased hot moments for riparian denitrification at the land water interface nitrogen was trapped by the dam and removed during hydropower production this could be beneficial to eutrophication mitigation in reservoirs and also interesting for coastal waters at river deltas as most large rivers in the world are heavily dammed to create enormous reservoirs moran et al 2018 these findings are significant for understanding the global effects of nitrogen biogeochemical cycles and water quality using high resolution digital elevation model and reservoir databases worldwide 5 conclusions there has been increasing debate over the environmental impacts of hydropower development on large rivers our results indicated that the intensified water level fluctuations following hydropower production accelerated wetting drying cycles and hyporheic exchanges hence increasing hot moments of riparian denitrification as the normal water level increased the decreased slope of the riparian zone enlarged the areas for denitrification under the same amplitude of water level changes the accelerated denitrification as well as the enlarged hot spots area jointly enhanced nitrogen removal via riparian denitrification at the land water interface these findings should advance our knowledge on the environmental impacts of hydropower development on rivers credit authorship

denitrification process shrewsbury et al 2016 of which nirs for encoding nitric oxide reductase and nosz for encoding nitrous oxide reductase are the most common gene markers for denitrifiers guo et al 2013 hou et al 2014 morales et al 2010 throbäck et al 2004 and were used in the qpcr in this study dna was extracted from the sediment using a fastdna power max soil dna isolation kit mp biomedical usa according to the manufacturer s instructions this dna subsequently served as a template for qpcr amplification the qpcr assay was performed using primer cd3af r3 cd to target nirs and primer nosz2f nosz2r to target nosz hou et al 2014 gene copies were amplified and quantified in a bio rad cycler equipped with the iq5 real time fluorescence detection system and software v2 0 bio rad usa

triplicate on 96 well plates sealed with optical quality sealing tape bio rad usa three negative controls without dna template were included for each pcr run 2 4 nitrous oxide flux analysis nitrous oxide fluxes at the 10 sampling sites were analyzed using the static chamber method after the water level receded based on the concentration changes over time in the chamber headspace beaulieu et al 2010 duchemin et al 1999 the plexiglass chamber was a 6 28 l cylinder 20 cm diameter 20 cm height covered with mylar paper to prevent temperature rise inside when exposed to the sun a collar was installed at each site a few days before flux measurements to avoid the perturbation caused by the penetration of the chamber in the sediment gas samples 20 ml were collected every 10 min over a 40 min period using a 25 ml polypropylene syringe and then injected into a pre evacuated exetainer vial 839 w labco uk for storage until analysis using gas chromatography 7890b agilent technologies usa gas fluxes were calculated using linear regression based on the concentration changes of five samples over time linear regression correlation coefficients of 0 9 were not accepted for further calculations 2 5 statistical analyses one way analysis of variance anova was employed to test the statistical significance of differences between sampling sites and post hoc multiple comparisons of treatment means were performed using tukey s least significant differences spss v22 0 spss inc chicago usa the level of significance was set to p 0 05 for all tests correlation analysis between the denitrification rate and the period of wetting drying cycle in the controlled field experiment was conducted using logarithmic function origin pro 8 0 originlab corp usa 3 results 3 1 water level fluctuations in the reservoir following hydropower production the water levels fluctuated frequently within the range of 4 67 m to 1 69 m yielding a maximum oscillation of 6 36 m fig 3 a the fft analysis indicated that there was a dominant period of approximately 7 8 d in the water level fluctuations fig 3b in contrast the water level exhibited an annual pattern with a period of 365 d fig 3c prior to the construction of manwan dam 3 2 groundwater level fluctuations and hyporheic exchanges in the riparian zone as water level fluctuated in the reservoir similar oscillations were observed in the island groundwater but were relatively damped and lagged fig 4 a during the 72 h observation period the maximum oscillation in the reservoir s5 s7 and s10 reached 2 10 1 44 1 31 and 0 99 m respectively data from water level recorders indicated that water level responses in s5 s7 and s10 lagged the reservoir by 20 25 and 30 min respectively according to the darcy law hyporheic exchanges across the island bank were largest at the island edge and decreased from the edge to the center the hyporheic flow rates at the reservoir s5 s5 s7 and s7 s10 zones maintained at 4 77 10 3 9 14 10 3 m2 d 1 8 11 10 3 2 46 10 3 and 3 94 10 3 2 26 10 3 m2 d 1 over the 72 h observation period fig 4b 3 3 sediment denitrification potential nitrous oxide flux and dissolved nitrate concentration the obtained results showed that denitrification was generally more active in the surface sediment than in the subsurface sediment but exhibited significant spatial heterogeneity across the island fig 5 from the island edge to the center the denitrification potential rate in the surface sediment increased from 51 9 10 3 g m 2d 1 at site s1 to 105 5 10 3 g m 2 d 1 at site s5 followed by a reduction below 13 4 10 3 g m 2 d 1 for sites s8 s10 fig 5a however the denitrification potential rate in the subsurface remained consistently low at 2 2 26 4 g m 2 d 1 nitrous oxide flux across the sampling sites showed a similar pattern as surface sediment denitrification i e increased from 1 93 10 3 g m 2 d 1 at s1 to 2 34 10 3 g m 2 d 1 at s5 and then decreased to 0 01 10 3 g m 2 d 1 at site s10 the nitrate concentration in the groundwater was below the detection limit 0 02 mg n l 1 for stations s1 s8 but reached 0 04 0 07 mg n l 1 at sites s9 s10 fig 5a the controlled field experiments indicated that there was a strong negative logarithmic relationship between the denitrification rate and the period of wetting drying cycle r2 0 98 p 0 01 fig 5b 3 4 dissolved organic carbon the doc content in the groundwater showed a significant lateral gradient across the island p 0 05 but higher than the adjacent reservoir from the island edge to the center the doc decreased from 7 3 mg l 1 at s1 to 1 7 mg l 1 at s10 while was only 1 4 mg l 1 in the adjacent reservoir fig 6 moreover the percentage of doc to total organic carbon in sediment also showed a general decreasing trend from 49 1 at the island edge to 17 6 at the center fig 6 3 5 denitrifier abundance generally denitrifier counts were abundant in the surface sediment 0 10 cm while were rare in the subsurface layer 10 20 cm of the island in the surface sediment denitrifiers were distributed non uniformly across sampling sites showing a peak between the edge and the center fig 7 a and b the nirs gene increased from 1 0 106 copies g 1 at s1 to 1 7 106 copies g 1 at s6 and then decreased to 3 0 103 copies g 1 at s10 however the gene was below 0 6 106 copies g 1 in the subsurface sediment across all sites fig 7a similarly the nosz gene increased from 0 9 106 copies g 1 at s1 to 1 5 106 copies g 1 at s5 and then decreased to 0 3 106 copies g 1 at s10 however the gene below 5 1 105 copies g 1 in the subsurface sediment across all sites fig 7b 4 discussion in reservoirs water storage and release occur frequently for hydropower production francis et al 2010 holzapfel et al 2017 such operations accelerate water level fluctuations compared to natural rivers kolbjørn jensen et al 2017 and thus generate frequent wet dry cycles at the riparian zone at the water land interface zhu et al 2013 during the process of water storage the riparian zone is in an anoxic state followed by a shift back to an aerobic state as oxygen penetrates the sediment during water release blackburn et al 2017 which have been found to favor denitrification in riparian zones ranalli and macalady 2010 wang et al 2018 in the current study we found that the denitrification potential rate at the upslope edge of the riparian zone was higher than at the edge zone near the reservoir fig 5 as the former was exposed to more frequent wetting drying cycles the denitrification potential rate was lowest at the island center fig 5 where floods seldom reached as a result groundwater nitrate was consumed and its concentration fell below the detection limit 0 02 mg n l 1 whereas large amounts of nitrous oxide were produced and emitted at a high rate of 1 93 2 34 10 3 g m 2 d 1 across the entire riparian zone in contrast the concentration of groundwater nitrate reached 0 04 0 07 mg n l 1 and the nitrous oxide flux was below 0 01 10 3 g m 2d 1 at the island center fig 5 we also observed that the pattern of denitrifier distribution fig 7 was generally similar to that of denitrification activity fig 5a along the transect organic carbon serves to satisfy energy demands of heterotrophic bacteria to maintain life sobczak et al 2003 zarnetske et al 2011 the majority of denitrifiers are facultative anaerobic heterotrophs which are limited by the availability of organic carbon sobczak et al 2003 von der heide et al 2008 zarnetske et al 2011 zarnetske et al 2011 reported that the rate of denitrification in riparian zones can more than double under elevated doc conditions as water level fluctuated in the reservoir a hysteretic response occurred in groundwater level in the island fig 4a creating hydraulic heads and driving hyporheic exchanges between the reservoir and island hyporheic exchanges were strongest close to the island edge and decreased from the edge to the center with the attenuation of groundwater level fluctuations fig 4b these strong hyporheic exchanges at the island edge can accelerate doc mineralization thereby increasing doc supply wilson et al 2013 we detected a higher concentration of doc and higher percentage of doc to total organic carbon in sediment at the island edge than at the center fig 6 which would supply sufficient carbon to fuel active denitrification at the island edge moreover alternate wetting drying may produce the biosimulation effect on denitrifiers contributing to the spatial heterogeneity of denitrification across the riparian zone this needs to further study the responses of denitrifier activities to alternate wetting drying using other techniques such as dna rna based stable isotope probing dumont and murrell 2005 in unregulated river systems with natural flow regimes hydrological processes within hyporheic zones at the land water interface usually exhibit annual patterns with the period of t 365 d as observed in the current study before impoundment fig 3c after impoundment however water level fluctuations have accelerated increasing the occurrence of denitrification as found in the relationship between k t and t fig 5b moreover after impoundment the normal water level increased and usually the slope of the riparian zone ɵ decreased enlarging the hot spot areas for denitrification under the same water level fluctuation amplitude to show the impacts of impoundment and flow regulation on the riparian denitrification in reservoirs a conceptual formula was proposed as r k t δ h sin θ where r is the nitrogen removal rate per unit by riparian denitrification g m 1d 1 k t is the denitrification rate as a function of t g m 2d 1 t is the period of wetting drying cycle d δh is the amplitude of water level fluctuation m ɵ is the slop of the riparian zone as shown in the formula the accelerated water level fluctuation t as well as the enlarged hot spot areas ɵ jointly enhanced the riparian denitrification at the land water interface in the reservoir however further studies are needed to calibrate the coefficients of the formula by collecting sufficient field data this study demonstrated that river damming and hydropower production enlarged hot spots and increased hot moments for riparian denitrification at the land water interface nitrogen was trapped by the dam and removed during hydropower production this could be beneficial to eutrophication mitigation in reservoirs and also interesting for coastal waters at river deltas as most large rivers in the world are heavily dammed to create enormous reservoirs moran et al 2018 these findings are significant for understanding the global effects of nitrogen biogeochemical cycles and water quality using high resolution digital elevation model and reservoir databases worldwide 5 conclusions there has been increasing debate over the environmental impacts of hydropower development on large rivers our results indicated that the intensified water level fluctuations following hydropower production accelerated wetting drying cycles and hyporheic exchanges hence increasing hot moments of riparian denitrification as the normal water level increased the decreased slope of the riparian zone enlarged the areas for denitrification under the same amplitude of water level changes the accelerated denitrification as well as the enlarged hot spots area jointly enhanced nitrogen removal via riparian denitrification at the land water interface these findings should advance our knowledge on the environmental impacts of hydropower development on rivers credit authorship

5766,change point or step trend detection is an active area of research in statistics and an area of great interest in hydrology because change points may be evidence of natural or anthropogenic changes in climatic hydrologic or landscape processes a common change point technique is the pettitt test however many change point methods are now available and testing of methods has been limited this study investigated eight methods for detecting change points in the location central tendency seven methods and scale dispersion or spread one method of annual peak streamflows using simulated data with and without change points and peak streamflow series from basins with known large additions of reservoir storage parametric methods tested including a bayesian one did not perform well even when transforming peak streamflows to approximate normality by using logarithms nonparametric methods other than the pettitt test allow for more than one change point but have an unacceptable number of false positives based on the results of our methods comparisons we used the pettitt and the mood tests to find change points in location and scale respectively in thousands of streamgage records in the conterminous united states change points in location median and scale are abundant with the changes in median peak streamflow showing regional patterns as well as a strong increased streamflow signal around 1970 the changes in scale of peak streamflows are dominated more by temporal than spatial patterns more streamgages had decreases in scale in earlier decades than recent decades and more streamgages had increases in scale occurring in recent decades than earlier decades keywords change points step trends peak streamflow surface water hydrology methods comparison 1 introduction change points also called step trends are abrupt changes in the distribution parameters of a dataset they occur at a point where the data separates into two subsets with different statistical properties friedman et al 2016 these properties include changes in central tendency such as mean for normally distributed data or median and changes in scale such as variance and interquartile range page 1955 1957 change point detection in time series data is an active area of research in statistics and an area of great interest in hydrology because change points have statistical implications for hydrologic analyses for example standard flood frequency analysis in the united states assumes that observations are independent and identically distributed from a particular statistical distribution such as the log pearson type iii that is such analyses assume that processes are stationary england et al 2018 a change point in a time series is a violation of this assumption change points are nonstationarities change points also are problematic for trend analysis of streamflow metrics even if a researcher uses a nonparametric trend method which is more robust to occurrences of outliers and skewness than parametric methods helsel and hirsch 1992 higgins 2003 change points are a concern because nonparametric methods are not assumption free in the commonly used mann kendall test for monotonic trend helsel and hirsch 1992 one assumption of the method is that in the absence of a trend the observations are independent and identically distributed a change point is a change in the distribution which indicates that the observations are not identically distributed additionally change points are of concern for both water resource managers and data analysts because change points may be evidence of natural or anthropogenic changes in climatic hydrologic or landscape processes such as abrupt changes in rainfall runoff reservoir storage diversions urbanization or agricultural practices for example precipitation and streamflow can reflect short or long term climatic persistence cohn and lins 2005 koutsoyiannis 2011 2006 and climatic persistence can abruptly shift from drier to wetter states kolars et al 2016 ryberg et al 2014 vecchia 2008 change points in streamflow have previously been related to increased precipitation mccabe and wolock 2002 peak streamflow downstream from large impoundments often have decreased magnitude relative to pre impoundment conditions poff et al 1997 fitzhugh and vogel 2011 found that dams reduced median annual floods by 55 for large rivers 25 for medium rivers and 10 for small rivers rapid urbanization can cause abrupt increases in peak streamflow as water runs off faster from paved surfaces than vegetated surfaces and as storm water infrastructure is installed leopold 1968 villarini et al 2009 found change points clustered in the 1940s in the mississippi river basin and related them to land use and land cover changes publicly available tools have been created to make detecting these nonstationarities quicker easier and more consistent these tools incorporate several well known tests for change points and include the u s army corps of engineers nonstationarity tool u s army corps of engineers 2017 trend software chiew and siriwardena 2005 and packages for the statistical software r r core team 2018 for change point analysis including bcp bayesian change point analysis erdman and emerson 2007 wang et al 2015 changepoint parametric change point analysis methods killick et al 2016 killick and eckley 2014 changepoint np nonparametric change point analysis haynes 2016 ecp nonparametric methods including energy agglomerative and energy divisive james and matteson 2014 cpm ross 2015a b and trend contains several change point detection methods including the pettitt test pohlert 2018 published tests of change point methods relevant to peak streamflow time series are limited villarini et al 2009 compared four change point methods using historical peak streamflow data pettitt test cumulative deviations from the mean cusum buishand 1982 a semi parametric test guan 2004 and a bayesian change point test erdman and emerson 2007 results from the pettitt test were in closest agreement with change point years as inferred from u s geological survey usgs data and site information at 47 streamgages villarini et al 2009 sharma et al 2016 compared four methods wild binary segmentation wbs energy agglomerative iterative robust detection and bayesian analysis bcp based on simulated data and found that all the methods were capable of detecting change in the mean of data and that the bcp method detected a high percentage of false positives mallakpour and villarini 2016 used simulated data to examine the performance of the pettitt test for low median and high streamflows and found that the sensitivity of the pettitt test for detecting shifts in the location of a time series is higher when the time series is composed of median flows than when the time series is composed of high flows such as annual maximum flows abrupt changes are more easily detected when they occur near the center of the series mallakpour and villarini 2016 which implies the ability to detect a change in location rather than a change in skewness or degree of outliers the pettitt method has been found to be sensitive to the presence of trends and serial correlation busuioc and von storch 1996 when an analyst s goal is the detection of change point nonstationarities in streamflow data ideally a detection method would not rely on the two assumptions that the data fit a normal distribution and are independent the first assumption is problematic because streamflow data tend to have skewed non normal distributions and the second is problematic in that streamflow may be autocorrelated because of short and long term hydro climatic persistence and water management practices an ideal detection method also should be able to find multiple change points because there may be multiple substantial changes over a lengthy period of record in selecting change point methods for comparison we considered several desired characteristics of methods first we included nonparametric and parametric methods including a bayesian method nonparametric tests have known advantages for streamflow data in that they do not assume that the data are normally distributed but trend analyses often are done with logarithmically transformed streamflow data and parametric methods might perform well on transformed data second we used existing implementations of change point methods that are publicly available in r development of a new method or software was not the goal of this study finally we considered change point methods that can detect more than one change point sites in the interior of north america with long streamflow records and longer climate records including tree rings and sediment cores have been shown to have long term climatic persistence with multiple change points caused by shifts between wetter and drier climate states kolars et al 2016 razavi et al 2015 ryberg et al 2014 2016 vecchia 2008 multiple streamflow change points may occur at a site because of multiple climatic and or land use changes over extended periods however we included the pettitt test which only detects one change point for comparison because of the method s common use in hydrology and past performance in a comparison study villarini et al 2009 in addition to these criteria we reviewed work done by the u s army corps of engineers in detecting change points at streamgages and revised our list based on their reported strengths and weaknesses of the change point methods they used friedman et al 2018 2016 because published tests of change point methods relevant to peak streamflow time series have been limited we simulated time series peak streamflow data with change points in mean change points in standard deviation monotonic trends but no change points and data with no induced changes we then tested the ability of eight methods seven for changes in location and one for changes in scale to detect the change points in the simulated data series and the ability of the methods to detect change points in peak streamflow series with documented change points caused by large additions of reservoir storage in addition we analyzed the false positive rates for change points for all time series after the methods were evaluated we selected the best method for determining change points in location and scale in peak streamflow and applied the methods to records from across the united states results are presented for 2683 streamgages in the most comprehensive analysis of historical peak streamflow change points to date results are parsed for the first time by basin type including minimally altered basins regulated basins high reservoir storage but low urbanization and urbanized basins with low reservoir storage 2 data and methods 2 1 simulated data the lmomco r package asquith 2017 was used to estimate pearson type iii distribution parameters mean standard deviation and skew of the peak streamflow series of six streamgages selected for their differences in hydrologic settings drainage basin sizes and record lengths those six sets of parameter estimates were then used with the lmomco r package to simulate 100 random realizations of each parameter set with random record length sample size from 50 to 200 to create 600 simulated time series we then created 600 series with a linear trend correlation of random streamflow with year randomly varying from 0 4 to 0 4 600 series with single change point using a log transformed step trend model with steps randomly generated from 1 to 1 placing steps at random locations but not within the first 5 or last 5 years of the series 600 series with two change points using two log transformed step trend models with steps randomly generated from 1 to 1 placing steps at two random locations but not within the first 5 or last 5 years of the series and 600 series with a randomly located change points in the standard deviation percent difference randomly selected from a sequence of 0 5 to 0 5 with steps of 0 02 excluding 0 these series are reproducible using the r code in the supplementary material 2 2 peak streamflow data from basins known to have a substantial addition of reservoir storage in addition to the simulated data we tested change point detection methods using historical peak streamflow data from basins across the conterminous united states with known substantial additions of reservoir storage during their periods of record we selected streamgages from those included in gages ii geospatial attributes of gages for evaluating streamflow version ii falcone 2011 that had at least 69 years of data through 2009 using this subset of streamgages we used the basin characteristics in gages ii to find streamgages with single well defined additions of substantial regulation the addition of substantial regulation was identified using three criteria 1 a single decadal change from one decadal estimate of dam storage in the basin to another columns pre1940 stor through pre1990 stor defined as dam storage in basin pre19xx in megaliters total storage per square kilometer ml km2 that exceeded 85 percent of the 2009 total national inventory of dams nid u s army corps of engineers 2010 storage stor nid 2009 column dam storage in basin ml km2 2 a specific year of reservoir storage addition listed in the column wr report remarks defined as water report remarks pertinent to hydrologic modifications if any from usgs annual data reports u s geological survey 2018 and 3 a check that the specific year agrees with decadal change columns of the identified changes that met those criteria we selected storage changes of at least 75 ml km2 0 075 m watershed depth in the interest of finding changes in storage that might have a detectable change point in peak streamflow we chose this metric based on past efforts to determine the degree of storage that would affect peak streamflow according to benson 1963 who described a study of a humid region with diverse terrain new england changes in usable storage of less than 49 2 ml km2 0 049 m watershed depth would generally modify peak streamflow by less than 10 percent according to asquith 2001 who described an empirical study of storage volumes of surface water in a different region texas flood storage of about 0 05 to 0 10 m of watershed depth is expected to substantially affect the mean annual peak streamflow we then used the list of reservoir affected streamgages to import peak streamflow records from the u s geological survey national water information system nwis at https nwis waterdata usgs gov usa nwis peak u s geological survey 2017b known as the peak flow file pff annual peak streamflow at a streamgage is defined as the maximum instantaneous streamflow in a water year a water year begins on october 1 and continues through september 30 of the following year and is designated by the calendar year in which it ends for example water year 2015 extends from october 1 2014 through september 30 2015 all available annual peak streamflows from 1916 through 2015 were used annual peak streamflows with qualification codes indicating a maximum daily mean value not an instantaneous peak peak qualification code 1 streamflow affected by dam failure code 3 an uncertain peak value streamflow known to be less than or greater than an indicated value codes 4 and 8 recorded peaks outside of the systematic record historical peak code 7 or any part of the date of occurrence is unknown or not exact codes a and b were removed from the dataset see ryberg et al 2017 for more detailed descriptions of qualification codes the records were then screened by requiring 20 or more peaks before and after the identified year of storage addition seventy seven streamgages across the conterminous united states met all the above criteria however there are notable gaps in parts of the united states see fig s1 in supplemental material 2 3 peak streamflow data for analyzing historical change points across the united states the streamgages used for the analysis of change points across the united states were selected from the gages ii database falcone 2011 the geospatial data available for each streamgage include several hundred basin characteristics that could facilitate later attribution efforts annual peak streamflow data for these streamgages came from the usgs nwis pff u s geological survey 2017b the peak streamflow data have been routinely reviewed by the usgs and have been recently subject to an improvement effort to correct errors that could have inadvertently resulted in outliers or change points ryberg 2008 ryberg et al 2017 and therefore were assumed to be correct we selected three periods for analysis 1 a 100 year period water years 1916 2015 2 a 75 year period water years 1941 2015 and 3 a 50 year period water years 1966 2015 streamgages in each of these time periods were required to have 80 percent completeness for each decade for example 1930 39 was required to have 8 of 10 water years of record for partial decades 1916 1919 was required to have 3 of 4 water years 1941 1949 7 of 9 water years 1966 1969 3 of 4 water years and 2010 2015 5 of 6 water years streamgages were subset into four categories 1 basins with minimal human alterations from the hcdn usgs hydro climatic data network 2009 which represents streamgages that are suitable for analyzing hydrologic variations and trends caused by climatic changes lins 2012 2 regulated basins high regulation and low urbanization 3 urban basins greater than10 percent developed and low regulation or 4 basins not in these categories uncategorized the 2683 streamgages used with selected geospatial attributes the categories to which they were assigned and the definitions of the categories are available in an accompanying data release dudley et al 2018 2 4 change point methods tested based on the criteria described in section 1 for change point methods and preliminary experiments with methods the methods shown in table 1 were selected for comparison parametric methods that search for change points in mean or variance assume the data are independent and identically distributed separate distributions before and after the change point and can be described by a particular statistical distribution usually the normal distribution however peak streamflows usually have a non normal distribution because of their skew and are often transformed to approximate normality by taking the logarithm of the peaks nonparametric methods that search for a change in location or scale still have the independent and identically distributed assumption but do not assume a particular distribution and are more robust to outliers for all change point methods the input is a series of randomly generated or actual peak streamflow data of the form y1 n y1 y2 yn where yi r where yi is the peak streamflow in year i 2 4 1 the pruned exact linear time method the pruned exact linear time method pelt killick et al 2012 was developed to detect multiple change points in large datasets and is a compromise method in terms of algorithm complexity and computational speed as compared to the other methods in the changepoint r package the pelt method is an exact segmentation whereas the binary segmentation method is approximate and pelt is more computationally efficient than the segment neighborhoods method the pelt method minimizes a cost function of possible pruned locations of change points because pelt is a parametric test for changes in the mean the base 10 logarithms of peak streamflow were used as a transformation to approximate normality the pelt method works as follows let n equal the length of the series and initialize f 0 β cp 0 null and r1 0 where f s is the minimization for the data y 1 s β is a penalty constant that does not depend on the number or location of changepoints cp 0 indicates that at step 0 there are no change points iterate for τ 1 n over the following steps where c is the cost and k is a constant 0 or the penalization factor 1 calculate f τ minτ r τ f τ c y τ 1 τ β 2 let τ1 arg minτ r τ f τ c y τ 1 τ β 3 set cp τ cp τ1 τ1 4 set r τ 1 τ τ r τ f τ c y τ 1 τ k f τ the output is then the change points recorded in cp n killick et al 2012 the penalty used to determine change points was the package default the modified bayes information criterion mbic zhang and siegmund 2006 one of several standard penalties for change point analysis the method does not return p values for the change points which means that inferences based on statistical significance are not possible see killick et al 2012 and killick and eckley 2014 for more details 2 4 2 binary segmentation the binary segmentation method applies a change point test by minimizing a cost function and penalty term to the series and if a change point is found the series is split at the change point and the single change point procedure is repeated on the two new series if more change points are found in either of the series they are split further according to killick and eckley 2014 binary segmentation is arguably the most widely used multiple change point search method the base 10 logarithms of peak streamflow were used as a transformation to approximate normality in binary segmentation a single change point test is applied to the entire series to test if a change point exists at τ such that c y 1 τ c y τ 1 n β c y 1 n is true where c is a cost function and β is a penalty to guard against over fitting killick et al 2012 if it is false no change point is detected if a change point is found the series is split into two segments around that change point and each is tested for a change point and so on as long as change points are found the penalty used to determine change points was the mbic the method does not return p values for the change points which means that inferences based on statistical significance are not possible 2 4 3 the bayesian change point method the bayesian method bcp assumes that there exists an unknown partition of a series into segments such that the mean is constant within each segment conditional on the partition the model assumes that observations are independent and identically and normally distributed with constant means and variance within segments as described in erdman and emerson 2007 p 3 4 the algorithm uses a partition ρ u 1 u 2 u n where u i 1 indicates a change point at position i 1 we initialize u i to 0 for all i n with u n 1 in each step of the markov chain at each position i a value of u i is drawn from the conditional distribution of u i given the data and the current partition let b denote the number of blocks obtained if u i 0 conditional on u j for i j the transition probability p for the conditional probability of a change point at the position i 1 may be obtained from the simplified ratio presented in barry and hartigan 1993 p i 1 p i p u i 1 x u j j i p u i 0 x u j j i 0 γ p b 1 p n b 1 d p 0 λ w b 2 w 1 b 1 w n 1 2 d w 0 γ p b 1 1 p n b d p 0 λ w b 1 2 w 0 b 0 w n 1 2 d w where w 0 b 0 w 1 and b 1 w are the within and between block sums of squares obtained when u i 0 and u i 1 respectively and x is the data the tuning parameters γ and λ may take values in 0 1 chosen so that this method is effective in situations where there are not too many changes γ small and where the changes that do occur are of a reasonable size λ small barry and hartigan 1993 p 312 after each iteration the posterior means are updated conditional on the current partition the tuning parameters are optional arguments in the implementation of the algorithm in r and the default of 0 2 was used as that is considered to work well wang et al 2015 barry and hartigan 1993 estimates of the probability of a change point at any given location are returned wang et al 2015 unlike the other frequentist or algorithmic methods used in this study the bcp results are probability estimates based on markov chain monte carlo mcmc sampling from a probability distribution barry and hartigan 1993 erdman and emerson 2007 and therefore may vary slightly when the analysis is repeated no single or multiple partition is identified as best the base 10 logarithms of peak streamflow were used as a transformation to approximate normality the results were screened for change points with a posterior probability greater than 0 50 2 4 4 wild binary segmentation the wild binary segmentation wbs method uses an algorithm proposed by fryzlewicz 2014 to find potential locations of the change points in the mean of the input vector it can find multiple change points including change points over short intervals and with small changes in the mean wild binary segmentation is best described by the pseudocode of fryzlewicz 2014 p 2253 denote by f t m a set of m random intervals s m e m m 1 m whose start and end points have been drawn independently with replacement uniformly from the set 1 t the main function of the wbs algorithm is defined as follows function wildbinseg s e ζt if e s 1 then stop else m s e set of those indices m for which s m e m f t m is such that s m e m s e optional augment m s e m s e 0 where s 0 e 0 s e m 0 b 0 arg max m m s e b s m e m 1 x s m e m b if x s m e m b ζt then add b0 to the set of estimated change points wildbinseg s b0 ζt wildbinseg b0 1 e ζt else stop end if end if end function the algorithm does not return a p value which means that inferences based on statistical significance are not possible the base 10 logarithm of the peak streamflow series was used as a transformation to approximate normality 2 4 5 nonparametric pruned exact linear time method the nonparametric pelt method can find multiple change points in a dataset using the pelt algorithm as described above but with a nonparametric cost function based on the empirical distribution haynes 2016 the penalty used was the mbic the method does not return p values for the change points which means that inferences based on statistical significance are not possible 2 4 6 the pettitt test the pettitt test uses the mann whitney u test to find a single change point in the median of a series and returns a p value for the change point pettitt 1979 pohlert 2018 the pettitt test is robust to outliers and skewed distributions sagarika et al 2014 in rare instances the pettitt test returns two change points because of ties in the data in these instances we used the first change point the ranks r1 n of the y 1 n are used to calculate the pettitt statistic which is based on the mann whitney two sample test p k 2 i i r i k n 1 k 1 n the probable change point u is located at the k where the absolute value of p k is maximized u max 1 k n p k the approximate probability for a two sided test is calculated according to p v a l u e 2 e x p 6 u 2 n 3 n 2 hawkins and deng 2010 pettitt 1979 pohlert 2018 verstraeten et al 2006 2 4 7 the mann whitney test for change points the mann whitney test for change points is an implementation of a two sample nonparametric test for differences in location mann and whitney 1947 in a sequential manner so that multiple change points can be found ross 2015b the two sample test evaluates every possible way of splitting the series into two subseries sequentially as each new observation is added to the series the test statistic is compared to a threshold chosen to bound the false positive type 1 error rate ross 2015b the mann whitney test evaluates every possible way of splitting the series into two subseries sequentially as each new observation is added to the series all the change points that pass the threshold criterion are considered possible change points the test statistic for the mann whitney test is denoted u and is the smaller of u1 and u2 u 1 n 1 n 2 n 1 n 1 1 2 r 1 u 2 n 1 n 2 n 2 n 2 1 2 r 2 where r1 is the sum of the ranks for group 1 the values to the left of the change point in the peak streamflow series and r2 is the sum of the ranks for group 2 the values to the right of the change point in the peak streamflow series higgins 2003 because the test is based on a test statistic one would assume there would be an associated p value however the implementation of the test in the cpm r package does not return a p value instead of a returned p value the methods in cpm perform hypothesis tests sequentially and create an internal numerical simulation of the distribution of the test statistic the error rate is controlled by a quantity called the mean run length which is the arithmetic mean number of observations that do not have a change point before a false positive detection occurs the user can set a mean run length to one of several predetermined values ross undated all of these values are greater than the length of any of the series tested in this study therefore despite the fact that a p value is not returned it is reasonable to assume that the results are significant at conventional significance levels 0 01 or 0 05 given how the algorithm controls for the false positive rate 2 4 8 the mood two sample test for difference in scale the mood two sample test for differences in scale mood 1954 is favored over other nonparametric methods for differences in scale by ross et al 2011 because of its simple formulation and performance in power analysis the mood test assumes that the medians of the distributions on either side of the change point are equal and that the distribution differ only in the scale parameters taeger and kuhnt 2014 like the mann whitney test for change points in median the mood two sample test for difference in scale mood 1954 is implemented in a sequential manner to find multiple changes in scale ross 2015b a two sample test evaluates every possible way of splitting the series into two subseries sequentially as each new observation is added to the series the test statistic w calculated repeatedly at every change point in a sequential manner as each new observation is added is w i 1 n r i k n 1 2 2 if the y1 k s are dispersed relative to the yk 1 n s w will be relatively small mood 1954 like the mann whitney test one would assume there would be an associated p value however the implementation of the test in the cpm r package does not return a p value the error rate is controlled by the mean run length described in section 2 4 7 and it is reasonable to assume that the results are significant at conventional significance levels 2 5 comparison of methods for detecting change points in mean or median peak streamflow change point methods were compared based on their detection of induced change points in the simulated data section 2 1 and their false positive rates in the random series series with simulated trends and the series with simulated change points methods also were compared based on change points in observed peak streamflow data from across the united states with known major reservoir storage additions section 2 2 methods for detecting changes in central tendency were considered successful in finding a change point if the change point method chose a year 5 years from the actual year because picking the exact year is an unrealistic given the interannual variability of peak streamflows 2 6 national peak streamflow change points the methods considered best with high weight going to the false positive rate were used to find change points in location and scale for historical peak streamflow time series across the conterminous united states for change in location results are presented using a likelihood based approach which was proposed by hirsch et al 2015 as an alternative to simply reporting significant trends based on a significance level that would provide more descriptive language trend likelihood values were determined using the p value reported by the change point test using the equation 1 p v a l u e 2 when the trend is likely upward or likely downward the trend likelihood value associated with the trend is between 0 90 and 1 0 that is the chance of the trend occurring in the specified direction is at least 90 out of 100 when the trend is somewhat likely upward or somewhat likely downward the trend likelihood value associated with the trend is between 0 70 and 0 90 the chance of the trend occurring in the specified direction is between 70 and 90 out of 100 when the trend is about as likely as not the trend likelihood value associated with the trend is less than 0 70 the chance of the trend being either upward or downward is less than 70 out of 100 to clarify let us consider a change point in which median streamflow increased with a likelihood value of 0 80 using the traditional hypothesis testing approach and a traditional p value of either 0 05 or 0 01 the change point would be reported as nonsignificant using the likelihood based approach the change point would be reported instead as somewhat likely upward the traditional hypothesis testing approach could lead to a potentially false sense of security because it is interpreted as there being no proof of a change point the likelihood based approach shows instead that it is somewhat likely that a change point has occurred providing more information for decision makers likelihood values have been used to present national water quality trends oelsner et al 2017 ryberg et al 2019 u s geological survey 2017a and trends in ecological metrics zuellig and carlisle 2019 the presence of autocorrelation in a time series in the absence of a trend or after detrending violates the assumption of independence that change point tests have this can lead to the detection of non existent changes beaulieu et al 2009 in addition the existence of a trend or change point could cause an autocorrelation method to detect autocorrelation that is simply a function of the trend we examined the peak streamflow series and found that significant p value 0 05 lag one autocorrelation was present at 7 8 percent of 1465 streamflow streamgages for water years 1941 2015 significant correlation was present at 21 3 percent of regulated streamgages and 5 1 percent of hcdn streamgages minimal basin alterations we conclude that autocorrelation is not a major factor for change point interpretation for peak streamflows however the number of change points at regulated streamgages may be overestimated because of autocorrelation when finding changes in variance or scale in a time series with a known change in mean or median the power of the test is reduced by the presence of the changes in mean or median therefore the time series should be first adjusted for that change in the median nayak and villarini 2016 after the tests for change in location and scale in the peak streamflow series were selected the change points in location were determined when there was a statistically significant change the series were adjusted prior to the test for changes in scale the median adjusted change point for scale was determined by computing the pre and post step medians of peak streamflow magnitude and adding or subtracting the difference between the medians to the pre step time series for example if the pre step median is 1000 and the post step is 800 then 200 is subtracted from the pre step time series prior to testing for change point in scale 3 results 3 1 comparison of methods with simulated peak streamflow data the percent of the induced change points in central tendency detected in the simulated peak streamflow series section 2 1 was calculated as well as the mean number of false positives per series tested the results for the methods used to find change points in the mean or median are presented in table 2 as listed in table 2 most parametric methods do not perform well or at all for peak streamflow even after transformation to approximate normality the inability of the pelt and binary segmentation methods to find change points was concerning the code was checked and more simulations were run not shown the code was correct and it appeared that when the range of the data is narrow as when it has been transformed to base 10 logarithms the methods are insensitive to finding change points and only find changes of a large magnitude larger than any in the simulated data used for this study and larger than expected for most change points in peak streamflow the wbs method was the best of the parametric methods for tests of a change in the mean but had a much higher false positive rate than the nonparametric methods the nonparametric methods which test for a change in the median did not find all change points an expected result as some of the changes in the simulated data were small the nonparametric pelt method had the highest percentage of correct detection in the simulated data table 2 but having the highest false positive rate of the nonparametric methods offset the correct detections the pettitt test had the lowest false positive rate of the nonparametric methods for the simulated data table 2 despite an interest in finding multiple change points the low false positive rate of the pettitt test for randomly generated series without change points indicates that the pettitt test is the most appropriate change point method for analyzing historical peak streamflows because the parametric methods were not working for the peak streamflow even after logarithmic transformation parametric methods were dropped from consideration for changes in scale this left only the mood test therefore no comparisons are shown for changes in scale the mood test correctly found 29 67 percent of simulated change points in scale and had a mean of 0 39 false positives per series changes in scale 10 years of the actual change were considered correct because changes in variability are by definition more complex than changes in central tendency 3 2 comparison of methods for peak streamflow data with a substantial addition of reservoir storage a comparison of the change point method results at regulated streamgages is shown in table 3 these sites have a known major reservoir addition during their period of record section 2 2 these change points represent substantial changes in reservoir storage and some of the changes are larger than those in the simulated data given this all change point detection methods had better performance than for the simulated peak streamflow data section 3 1 however the nonparametric methods were still superior to the parametric methods the pettitt and the cpm mann whitney tests had similar results for correctly finding known change points which was expected because both are based on the nonparametric mann whitney test however the cpm mann whitney found almost 2 5 times as many false positives as the pettitt test this is a confirmation of the prior conclusion from the simulated data that the pettitt test is the most appropriate method for change point analyses of peak streamflows the mood method also was used to test for the changes in scale that generally happen after a substantial change in reservoir storage assuming all the large storage changes also resulted in a change in scale of the peak streamflow distribution before and after the reservoir the mood test was correct 24 68 percent of the time and the false positive rate was a mean of 0 17 false positives per series 3 3 historical peak streamflow change points across the conterminous united states the pettitt test was applied to peak streamflows in the three trend periods water years 1916 2015 1941 2015 and 1966 2015 the test finds a change point in the location median of peak streamflow in every series and returns a p value the p values and direction of the change were converted to likelihoods section 2 6 and are presented spatially in fig 1 spatial distribution is one aspect of the analysis but timing of changes and the magnitude of the changes also are of interest animations presenting the timing and spatial distribution of the changes in median are described and presented in the supplemental material for each of the three trend periods for water years 1941 2015 the timing and magnitude of the increases and decreases in the median for all basin categories combined are summarized in fig 2 change point results are summarized by basin category in table 4 all results are published in the associated data release dudley et al 2018 the mood test was then applied to the peak streamflow series in the three trend periods to analyze changes in scale spread or dispersion to improve the power of the mood test when statistically significant changes in the median were found with the pettitt test the series was adjusted to a consistent median the test found zero to four change points in every series returning the change point but not a p value in contrast to the pettitt test the mood test results indicate the presence or absence of a change point for each year the time series few series had more than one change point in scale although one series had four change points the direction of the change in scale for all change points is presented in fig 3 however it is difficult to show all of them on the map when they plot on top of each other animations presenting the timing and spatial distribution of the changes in scale are described and presented in the supplemental material for each of the three trend periods and the associated data release dudley et al 2018 contains the results for water years 1941 2015 the timing and magnitude of the increases and decreases in scale for all basins combined are summarized in fig 4 change point results for scale are summarized by basin category in table 5 4 discussion 4 1 comparison of results with previous studies in terms of selecting a change point method for changes in central tendency our results expand upon and confirm those of villarini et al 2009 who tested four multiple change point detection methods including the pettitt test and the bayesian method used in this study they used usgs peak streamflow at 47 streamgages with a qualification code indicating a change to regulated conditions and chose the pettitt test as the best one because of its performance in detecting known change points and its statistical properties of being robust to outliers and skewed distributions villarini et al 2009 we tested seven methods for change point detection in location with synthetic data and peak streamflow data with known change points from reservoir additions the pettitt test represents the best balance between detecting change points and having a low false detection rate the patterns shown in the change points in median peak streamflow across the conterminous united states using the pettitt test fig 1 are similar spatially to those shown for linear trends in the logarithm of peak streamflow at 200 long term 85 127 years of record streamgages by hirsch and ryberg 2012 see fig 1 in that there are clusters of increases north of 40 degrees latitude and east of 100 degrees longitude and in the pacific northwest also there are more decreases south of 40 degrees latitude and west of approximately 100 degrees longitude some of these sites may have both change points and linear trends or in some cases some of the linear trends may have been change points many of the change points are similar temporally to those of mccabe and wolock 2002 they used a monotonic trend method kendall s tau over varying trend periods for 400 streamgages from 1941 to 99 and hypothesized that many of the trends detected were step trends occurring around 1970 with increases more noticeable in annual minimum and median daily streamflow than annual maximum daily streamflow fig 2 shows a concentration of change points in the mid 1960s to the early 1970s that resulted in increased median peak streamflows perhaps the change point around 1970 is more evident in peak streamflow now than it was for mccabe and wolock 2002 with the 16 years of added data in the current study villarini et al 2009 used the pettitt test to detect change points at 50 streamgages with at least 100 years of record and found changes caused by changes in gauging practice changes in land use and land cover regulation by reservoirs and climatic reasons this highlights the importance of the metadata available for sites in gages ii and why we categorized the sites as hcdn regulated urban or uncategorized villarini et al 2009 showed that significant trends based on monotonic tests can be attributable to change points conversely significant change points can be attributed to monotonic trends the pettitt test has been found to be sensitive to the presence of trends and serial correlation busuioc and von storch 1996 sharma et al 2016 found that if both trends and step changes are present analyzing only one can be misleading therefore monotonic trends across the united states were analyzed in a parallel study to the current change point study hodgkins et al 2019 4 2 reasons for peak streamflow change points the streamgages in fig 1 represent a combination of minimally altered hcdn basins and other basins that are affected to varying degrees by reservoir additions urbanization and other alterations potentially affecting annual peak streamflows however the maps fig 1 show that there are strong spatial patterns in the increases and decreases indicating regional climatic changes as a driver of changes in peak streamflow in the conterminous united states the blue up arrows that are clustered in the midwest and northeast united states fig 1 particularly water years 1966 2015 coincide with the regions of the united states that have the largest increases in observed heavy precipitation in 1948 2012 mallakpour and villarini 2017 and very heavy precipitation defined as the heaviest 1 percent of all daily events in 1958 2016 easterling et al 2017 and that have previously been identified as having change points villarini and smith 2010 the pettitt test decreases in sensitivity with increasing variability is not as sensitive to change in the extremes of a distribution and can be sensitive to changes in scale therefore the results in this article possibly underestimate changes in central tendency in peak streamflow across the conterminous united states over the 100 and 75 year periods of record more change points from hcdn basins are increases than decreases in median while in the 50 year period more change points are decreases table 4 presumably because of the nature of hcdn basins these change points were caused by changes in climate for regulated basins most basins have decreases in median peak streamflow over the 100 and 75 year periods an expected result with increased reservoir storage although some decreases could also be partly because of drier climatic conditions in parts of the southwest united states in recent decades easterling et al 2017 however 14 22 percent of change points at regulated basins are an increase in median likely because of the large increases in very heavy precipitation in the midwest and northeast easterling et al 2017 having more effect on peak streamflows than additional reservoir storage at basins in this area for urban basins in the 75 and 50 year periods most of the change points are increases the 100 year period has only one urban streamgage this supports the conceptual expectation that urbanization increases annual peak streamflow although there may be an interaction with increased heavy precipitation at many streamgages as many urbanized basins with long term streamflow record are in the midwest and northeast at uncategorized streamgages across the country the percent of increases and decreases is roughly even making change points without added spatial and temporal information seem like a random process however the maps in fig 1 show that there are substantial spatial patterns in the increases and decreases indicating regional climatic and land use patterns as drivers of changes in peak streamflow the blue up arrows that are clustered in the midwest and northeastern united states fig 1 particularly water years 1966 2015 coincide with the areas of the united states that have the largest increases in observed very heavy precipitation defined as the heaviest 1 percent of all daily events 1958 2012 fig 2 19 of melillo et al 2014 changes in scale spread or dispersion of peak streamflows are dominated more by temporal patterns than the spatial patterns in the median change points similarly the patterns of the changes in location mean and scale variance also did not match in a study by pagano and garen 2005 that examined april september streamflow volumes for 141 unregulated basins in the western united states in our study more decreases in scale occurred earlier in the three periods tested whereas more increases occurred later in the periods fig 4 and supplemental material after 2000 all changes in scale were increases except one however the largest increases in scale happened prior to 1990 fig 4 a mix of increases and decreases in scale occurred across the conterminous united states without strong and cohesive regional patterns regulated sites show a pattern of decreasing scale occurring earlier in the period of record fig 4 consistent with the timing of most dam construction billington et al 2005 the largest percentage of change points in scale occurred at regulated basins for water years 1916 2015 48 percent with one change point table 5 which is expected with changes caused by additions of reservoirs over a lengthy period of record however changes in scale at regulated basins were not always decreases in scale perhaps because of climatic changes or reservoir management changes most hcdn basins with change points in scale showed an increase as with the change point in median these change points were likely caused by changes in climate because these sites are relatively undeveloped and suitable for analysis of climate related trends urban streamgages showed a higher rate of increases in scale than decreases uncategorized sites had similar percentages of increase and decreases fewer change points in scale were found for all basin types for water years 1966 2015 than for the two longer periods the ability to detect changes may decline with shorter periods of record and at many sites regulation occurred before 1966 other than noting patterns in change points at regulated urbanized and hcdn streamgages and general spatial and temporal patterns detailed attribution of specific change points at streamgages is beyond the scope of this paper however the ubiquity of change points is a concern for analyses of annual peak streamflow such as flood frequency analysis the recently released guidelines for determining flood flow frequency bulletin 17c specifically says that the procedures do not cover watersheds where flood flows are appreciably altered by reservoir regulation basin changes or hydrologic nonstationarities england et al 2018 p 2 and the work group that developed the guidelines did not evaluate methods to account for climate variability in flood frequency england et al 2018 p 23 advancements are needed in flood frequency analysis to address nonstationarities however it is important to note that as shown in the testing of change point methods and noted by salas et al 2018 change points can appear in random series or be a feature of low frequency components of the atmospheric and oceanic system stationarity should be the default assumption unless one can justify the nonstationarity assumption which should be based on physical understanding of the processes causing change points not solely on trend based interpretations of the at site information matalas 2012 salas et al 2018 serinaldi and kilsby 2015 5 conclusions change point analysis is an active area of research in statistics and an ongoing concern in hydrology because of advancements in methodology and computing many change point methods are now available but testing of methods on peak streamflow data has been limited in the most comprehensive test to date we tested seven methods for their ability to detect change points in the location central tendency and one method for its ability to detect change points in scale dispersion or spread of annual peak streamflows and the methods tendencies to find false positives tests included both simulated peak streamflow time series and peak streamflow data from streamgages across the conterminous united states with known major additions of reservoir storage our results show that the pettitt test has the best balance between detecting known change points and having a low rate of false positives parametric methods tested including a bayesian one do not perform well even when transforming peak streamflows to approximate normality by using logarithms nonparametric methods other than the pettitt test allow for more than one change point but have an unacceptable number of false positives because of the poor performance of parametric methods for changes in location only the mood test remained for examining changes points in scale change points in peak streamflow median and scale are abundant across the conterminous united states with the changes in median peaks showing regional patterns as well as a strong widespread increase in median peak streamflow around 1970 the regional and national patterns indicate that many of the changes are related to climate and include increases in peak streamflow at hcdn sites that are suitable for analyzing hydrologic variations caused by climatic changes most change points at regulated sites are decreases and most change points at urban sites are increases both patterns match what is expected under these altered regimes those change points in the opposite direction of what is expected likely represent an interaction with climate that is altering the expected regulation or urbanization signal the changes in scale of peak streamflows are dominated more by temporal than spatial patterns there were more streamgages with decreases in scale occurring in earlier decades than recent decades and more streamgages with increases in scale occurring in recent decades than earlier decades regulated sites show a pattern of decreasing scale occurring earlier in the period of record consistent with the timing of most dam construction across the united states the many change points in median and scale of peak streamflow highlight the care with which analysts need to approach flood frequency analyses that rely on assumptions of stationarity basin specific attribution of these change points at the hundreds of basins with high likelihood of change is an important next step in understanding the hydrologic regime

5766,change point or step trend detection is an active area of research in statistics and an area of great interest in hydrology because change points may be evidence of natural or anthropogenic changes in climatic hydrologic or landscape processes a common change point technique is the pettitt test however many change point methods are now available and testing of methods has been limited this study investigated eight methods for detecting change points in the location central tendency seven methods and scale dispersion or spread one method of annual peak streamflows using simulated data with and without change points and peak streamflow series from basins with known large additions of reservoir storage parametric methods tested including a bayesian one did not perform well even when transforming peak streamflows to approximate normality by using logarithms nonparametric methods other than the pettitt test allow for more than one change point but have an unacceptable number of false positives based on the results of our methods comparisons we used the pettitt and the mood tests to find change points in location and scale respectively in thousands of streamgage records in the conterminous united states change points in location median and scale are abundant with the changes in median peak streamflow showing regional patterns as well as a strong increased streamflow signal around 1970 the changes in scale of peak streamflows are dominated more by temporal than spatial patterns more streamgages had decreases in scale in earlier decades than recent decades and more streamgages had increases in scale occurring in recent decades than earlier decades keywords change points step trends peak streamflow surface water hydrology methods comparison 1 introduction change points also called step trends are abrupt changes in the distribution parameters of a dataset they occur at a point where the data separates into two subsets with different statistical properties friedman et al 2016 these properties include changes in central tendency such as mean for normally distributed data or median and changes in scale such as variance and interquartile range page 1955 1957 change point detection in time series data is an active area of research in statistics and an area of great interest in hydrology because change points have statistical implications for hydrologic analyses for example standard flood frequency analysis in the united states assumes that observations are independent and identically distributed from a particular statistical distribution such as the log pearson type iii that is such analyses assume that processes are stationary england et al 2018 a change point in a time series is a violation of this assumption change points are nonstationarities change points also are problematic for trend analysis of streamflow metrics even if a researcher uses a nonparametric trend method which is more robust to occurrences of outliers and skewness than parametric methods helsel and hirsch 1992 higgins 2003 change points are a concern because nonparametric methods are not assumption free in the commonly used mann kendall test for monotonic trend helsel and hirsch 1992 one assumption of the method is that in the absence of a trend the observations are independent and identically distributed a change point is a change in the distribution which indicates that the observations are not identically distributed additionally change points are of concern for both water resource managers and data analysts because change points may be evidence of natural or anthropogenic changes in climatic hydrologic or landscape processes such as abrupt changes in rainfall runoff reservoir storage diversions urbanization or agricultural practices for example precipitation and streamflow can reflect short or long term climatic persistence cohn and lins 2005 koutsoyiannis 2011 2006 and climatic persistence can abruptly shift from drier to wetter states kolars et al 2016 ryberg et al 2014 vecchia 2008 change points in streamflow have previously been related to increased precipitation mccabe and wolock 2002 peak streamflow downstream from large impoundments often have decreased magnitude relative to pre impoundment conditions poff et al 1997 fitzhugh and vogel 2011 found that dams reduced median annual floods by 55 for large rivers 25 for medium rivers and 10 for small rivers rapid urbanization can cause abrupt increases in peak streamflow as water runs off faster from paved surfaces than vegetated surfaces and as storm water infrastructure is installed leopold 1968 villarini et al 2009 found change points clustered in the 1940s in the mississippi river basin and related them to land use and land cover changes publicly available tools have been created to make detecting these nonstationarities quicker easier and more consistent these tools incorporate several well known tests for change points and include the u s army corps of engineers nonstationarity tool u s army corps of engineers 2017 trend software chiew and siriwardena 2005 and packages for the statistical software r r core team 2018 for change point analysis including bcp bayesian change point analysis erdman and emerson 2007 wang et al 2015 changepoint parametric change point analysis methods killick et al 2016 killick and eckley 2014 changepoint np nonparametric change point analysis haynes 2016 ecp nonparametric methods including energy agglomerative and energy divisive james and matteson 2014 cpm ross 2015a b and trend contains several change point detection methods including the pettitt test pohlert 2018 published tests of change point methods relevant to peak streamflow time series are limited villarini et al 2009 compared four change point methods using historical peak streamflow data pettitt test cumulative deviations from the mean cusum buishand 1982 a semi parametric test guan 2004 and a bayesian change point test erdman and emerson 2007 results from the pettitt test were in closest agreement with change point years as inferred from u s geological survey usgs data and site information at 47 streamgages villarini et al 2009 sharma et al 2016 compared four methods wild binary segmentation wbs energy agglomerative iterative robust detection and bayesian analysis bcp based on simulated data and found that all the methods were capable of detecting change in the mean of data and that the bcp method detected a high percentage of false positives mallakpour and villarini 2016 used simulated data to examine the performance of the pettitt test for low median and high streamflows and found that the sensitivity of the pettitt test for detecting shifts in the location of a time series is higher when the time series is composed of median flows than when the time series is composed of high flows such as annual maximum flows abrupt changes are more easily detected when they occur near the center of the series mallakpour and villarini 2016 which implies the ability to detect a change in location rather than a change in skewness or degree of outliers the pettitt method has been found to be sensitive to the presence of trends and serial correlation busuioc and von storch 1996 when an analyst s goal is the detection of change point nonstationarities in streamflow data ideally a detection method would not rely on the two assumptions that the data fit a normal distribution and are independent the first assumption is problematic because streamflow data tend to have skewed non normal distributions and the second is problematic in that streamflow may be autocorrelated because of short and long term hydro climatic persistence and water management practices an ideal detection method also should be able to find multiple change points because there may be multiple substantial changes over a lengthy period of record in selecting change point methods for comparison we considered several desired characteristics of methods first we included nonparametric and parametric methods including a bayesian method nonparametric tests have known advantages for streamflow data in that they do not assume that the data are normally distributed but trend analyses often are done with logarithmically transformed streamflow data and parametric methods might perform well on transformed data second we used existing implementations of change point methods that are publicly available in r development of a new method or software was not the goal of this study finally we considered change point methods that can detect more than one change point sites in the interior of north america with long streamflow records and longer climate records including tree rings and sediment cores have been shown to have long term climatic persistence with multiple change points caused by shifts between wetter and drier climate states kolars et al 2016 razavi et al 2015 ryberg et al 2014 2016 vecchia 2008 multiple streamflow change points may occur at a site because of multiple climatic and or land use changes over extended periods however we included the pettitt test which only detects one change point for comparison because of the method s common use in hydrology and past performance in a comparison study villarini et al 2009 in addition to these criteria we reviewed work done by the u s army corps of engineers in detecting change points at streamgages and revised our list based on their reported strengths and weaknesses of the change point methods they used friedman et al 2018 2016 because published tests of change point methods relevant to peak streamflow time series have been limited we simulated time series peak streamflow data with change points in mean change points in standard deviation monotonic trends but no change points and data with no induced changes we then tested the ability of eight methods seven for changes in location and one for changes in scale to detect the change points in the simulated data series and the ability of the methods to detect change points in peak streamflow series with documented change points caused by large additions of reservoir storage in addition we analyzed the false positive rates for change points for all time series after the methods were evaluated we selected the best method for determining change points in location and scale in peak streamflow and applied the methods to records from across the united states results are presented for 2683 streamgages in the most comprehensive analysis of historical peak streamflow change points to date results are parsed for the first time by basin type including minimally altered basins regulated basins high reservoir storage but low urbanization and urbanized basins with low reservoir storage 2 data and methods 2 1 simulated data the lmomco r package asquith 2017 was used to estimate pearson type iii distribution parameters mean standard deviation and skew of the peak streamflow series of six streamgages selected for their differences in hydrologic settings drainage basin sizes and record lengths those six sets of parameter estimates were then used with the lmomco r package to simulate 100 random realizations of each parameter set with random record length sample size from 50 to 200 to create 600 simulated time series we then created 600 series with a linear trend correlation of random streamflow with year randomly varying from 0 4 to 0 4 600 series with single change point using a log transformed step trend model with steps randomly generated from 1 to 1 placing steps at random locations but not within the first 5 or last 5 years of the series 600 series with two change points using two log transformed step trend models with steps randomly generated from 1 to 1 placing steps at two random locations but not within the first 5 or last 5 years of the series and 600 series with a randomly located change points in the standard deviation percent difference randomly selected from a sequence of 0 5 to 0 5 with steps of 0 02 excluding 0 these series are reproducible using the r code in the supplementary material 2 2 peak streamflow data from basins known to have a substantial addition of reservoir storage in addition to the simulated data we tested change point detection methods using historical peak streamflow data from basins across the conterminous united states with known substantial additions of reservoir storage during their periods of record we selected streamgages from those included in gages ii geospatial attributes of gages for evaluating streamflow version ii falcone 2011 that had at least 69 years of data through 2009 using this subset of streamgages we used the basin characteristics in gages ii to find streamgages with single well defined additions of substantial regulation the addition of substantial regulation was identified using three criteria 1 a single decadal change from one decadal estimate of dam storage in the basin to another columns pre1940 stor through pre1990 stor defined as dam storage in basin pre19xx in megaliters total storage per square kilometer ml km2 that exceeded 85 percent of the 2009 total national inventory of dams nid u s army corps of engineers 2010 storage stor nid 2009 column dam storage in basin ml km2 2 a specific year of reservoir storage addition listed in the column wr report remarks defined as water report remarks pertinent to hydrologic modifications if any from usgs annual data reports u s geological survey 2018 and 3 a check that the specific year agrees with decadal change columns of the identified changes that met those criteria we selected storage changes of at least 75 ml km2 0 075 m watershed depth in the interest of finding changes in storage that might have a detectable change point in peak streamflow we chose this metric based on past efforts to determine the degree of storage that would affect peak streamflow according to benson 1963 who described a study of a humid region with diverse terrain new england changes in usable storage of less than 49 2 ml km2 0 049 m watershed depth would generally modify peak streamflow by less than 10 percent according to asquith 2001 who described an empirical study of storage volumes of surface water in a different region texas flood storage of about 0 05 to 0 10 m of watershed depth is expected to substantially affect the mean annual peak streamflow we then used the list of reservoir affected streamgages to import peak streamflow records from the u s geological survey national water information system nwis at https nwis waterdata usgs gov usa nwis peak u s geological survey 2017b known as the peak flow file pff annual peak streamflow at a streamgage is defined as the maximum instantaneous streamflow in a water year a water year begins on october 1 and continues through september 30 of the following year and is designated by the calendar year in which it ends for example water year 2015 extends from october 1 2014 through september 30 2015 all available annual peak streamflows from 1916 through 2015 were used annual peak streamflows with qualification codes indicating a maximum daily mean value not an instantaneous peak peak qualification code 1 streamflow affected by dam failure code 3 an uncertain peak value streamflow known to be less than or greater than an indicated value codes 4 and 8 recorded peaks outside of the systematic record historical peak code 7 or any part of the date of occurrence is unknown or not exact codes a and b were removed from the dataset see ryberg et al 2017 for more detailed descriptions of qualification codes the records were then screened by requiring 20 or more peaks before and after the identified year of storage addition seventy seven streamgages across the conterminous united states met all the above criteria however there are notable gaps in parts of the united states see fig s1 in supplemental material 2 3 peak streamflow data for analyzing historical change points across the united states the streamgages used for the analysis of change points across the united states were selected from the gages ii database falcone 2011 the geospatial data available for each streamgage include several hundred basin characteristics that could facilitate later attribution efforts annual peak streamflow data for these streamgages came from the usgs nwis pff u s geological survey 2017b the peak streamflow data have been routinely reviewed by the usgs and have been recently subject to an improvement effort to correct errors that could have inadvertently resulted in outliers or change points ryberg 2008 ryberg et al 2017 and therefore were assumed to be correct we selected three periods for analysis 1 a 100 year period water years 1916 2015 2 a 75 year period water years 1941 2015 and 3 a 50 year period water years 1966 2015 streamgages in each of these time periods were required to have 80 percent completeness for each decade for example 1930 39 was required to have 8 of 10 water years of record for partial decades 1916 1919 was required to have 3 of 4 water years 1941 1949 7 of 9 water years 1966 1969 3 of 4 water years and 2010 2015 5 of 6 water years streamgages were subset into four categories 1 basins with minimal human alterations from the hcdn usgs hydro climatic data network 2009 which represents streamgages that are suitable for analyzing hydrologic variations and trends caused by climatic changes lins 2012 2 regulated basins high regulation and low urbanization 3 urban basins greater than10 percent developed and low regulation or 4 basins not in these categories uncategorized the 2683 streamgages used with selected geospatial attributes the categories to which they were assigned and the definitions of the categories are available in an accompanying data release dudley et al 2018 2 4 change point methods tested based on the criteria described in section 1 for change point methods and preliminary experiments with methods the methods shown in table 1 were selected for comparison parametric methods that search for change points in mean or variance assume the data are independent and identically distributed separate distributions before and after the change point and can be described by a particular statistical distribution usually the normal distribution however peak streamflows usually have a non normal distribution because of their skew and are often transformed to approximate normality by taking the logarithm of the peaks nonparametric methods that search for a change in location or scale still have the independent and identically distributed assumption but do not assume a particular distribution and are more robust to outliers for all change point methods the input is a series of randomly generated or actual peak streamflow data of the form y1 n y1 y2 yn where yi r where yi is the peak streamflow in year i 2 4 1 the pruned exact linear time method the pruned exact linear time method pelt killick et al 2012 was developed to detect multiple change points in large datasets and is a compromise method in terms of algorithm complexity and computational speed as compared to the other methods in the changepoint r package the pelt method is an exact segmentation whereas the binary segmentation method is approximate and pelt is more computationally efficient than the segment neighborhoods method the pelt method minimizes a cost function of possible pruned locations of change points because pelt is a parametric test for changes in the mean the base 10 logarithms of peak streamflow were used as a transformation to approximate normality the pelt method works as follows let n equal the length of the series and initialize f 0 β cp 0 null and r1 0 where f s is the minimization for the data y 1 s β is a penalty constant that does not depend on the number or location of changepoints cp 0 indicates that at step 0 there are no change points iterate for τ 1 n over the following steps where c is the cost and k is a constant 0 or the penalization factor 1 calculate f τ minτ r τ f τ c y τ 1 τ β 2 let τ1 arg minτ r τ f τ c y τ 1 τ β 3 set cp τ cp τ1 τ1 4 set r τ 1 τ τ r τ f τ c y τ 1 τ k f τ the output is then the change points recorded in cp n killick et al 2012 the penalty used to determine change points was the package default the modified bayes information criterion mbic zhang and siegmund 2006 one of several standard penalties for change point analysis the method does not return p values for the change points which means that inferences based on statistical significance are not possible see killick et al 2012 and killick and eckley 2014 for more details 2 4 2 binary segmentation the binary segmentation method applies a change point test by minimizing a cost function and penalty term to the series and if a change point is found the series is split at the change point and the single change point procedure is repeated on the two new series if more change points are found in either of the series they are split further according to killick and eckley 2014 binary segmentation is arguably the most widely used multiple change point search method the base 10 logarithms of peak streamflow were used as a transformation to approximate normality in binary segmentation a single change point test is applied to the entire series to test if a change point exists at τ such that c y 1 τ c y τ 1 n β c y 1 n is true where c is a cost function and β is a penalty to guard against over fitting killick et al 2012 if it is false no change point is detected if a change point is found the series is split into two segments around that change point and each is tested for a change point and so on as long as change points are found the penalty used to determine change points was the mbic the method does not return p values for the change points which means that inferences based on statistical significance are not possible 2 4 3 the bayesian change point method the bayesian method bcp assumes that there exists an unknown partition of a series into segments such that the mean is constant within each segment conditional on the partition the model assumes that observations are independent and identically and normally distributed with constant means and variance within segments as described in erdman and emerson 2007 p 3 4 the algorithm uses a partition ρ u 1 u 2 u n where u i 1 indicates a change point at position i 1 we initialize u i to 0 for all i n with u n 1 in each step of the markov chain at each position i a value of u i is drawn from the conditional distribution of u i given the data and the current partition let b denote the number of blocks obtained if u i 0 conditional on u j for i j the transition probability p for the conditional probability of a change point at the position i 1 may be obtained from the simplified ratio presented in barry and hartigan 1993 p i 1 p i p u i 1 x u j j i p u i 0 x u j j i 0 γ p b 1 p n b 1 d p 0 λ w b 2 w 1 b 1 w n 1 2 d w 0 γ p b 1 1 p n b d p 0 λ w b 1 2 w 0 b 0 w n 1 2 d w where w 0 b 0 w 1 and b 1 w are the within and between block sums of squares obtained when u i 0 and u i 1 respectively and x is the data the tuning parameters γ and λ may take values in 0 1 chosen so that this method is effective in situations where there are not too many changes γ small and where the changes that do occur are of a reasonable size λ small barry and hartigan 1993 p 312 after each iteration the posterior means are updated conditional on the current partition the tuning parameters are optional arguments in the implementation of the algorithm in r and the default of 0 2 was used as that is considered to work well wang et al 2015 barry and hartigan 1993 estimates of the probability of a change point at any given location are returned wang et al 2015 unlike the other frequentist or algorithmic methods used in this study the bcp results are probability estimates based on markov chain monte carlo mcmc sampling from a probability distribution barry and hartigan 1993 erdman and emerson 2007 and therefore may vary slightly when the analysis is repeated no single or multiple partition is identified as best the base 10 logarithms of peak streamflow were used as a transformation to approximate normality the results were screened for change points with a posterior probability greater than 0 50 2 4 4 wild binary segmentation the wild binary segmentation wbs method uses an algorithm proposed by fryzlewicz 2014 to find potential locations of the change points in the mean of the input vector it can find multiple change points including change points over short intervals and with small changes in the mean wild binary segmentation is best described by the pseudocode of fryzlewicz 2014 p 2253 denote by f t m a set of m random intervals s m e m m 1 m whose start and end points have been drawn independently with replacement uniformly from the set 1 t the main function of the wbs algorithm is defined as follows function wildbinseg s e ζt if e s 1 then stop else m s e set of those indices m for which s m e m f t m is such that s m e m s e optional augment m s e m s e 0 where s 0 e 0 s e m 0 b 0 arg max m m s e b s m e m 1 x s m e m b if x s m e m b ζt then add b0 to the set of estimated change points wildbinseg s b0 ζt wildbinseg b0 1 e ζt else stop end if end if end function the algorithm does not return a p value which means that inferences based on statistical significance are not possible the base 10 logarithm of the peak streamflow series was used as a transformation to approximate normality 2 4 5 nonparametric pruned exact linear time method the nonparametric pelt method can find multiple change points in a dataset using the pelt algorithm as described above but with a nonparametric cost function based on the empirical distribution haynes 2016 the penalty used was the mbic the method does not return p values for the change points which means that inferences based on statistical significance are not possible 2 4 6 the pettitt test the pettitt test uses the mann whitney u test to find a single change point in the median of a series and returns a p value for the change point pettitt 1979 pohlert 2018 the pettitt test is robust to outliers and skewed distributions sagarika et al 2014 in rare instances the pettitt test returns two change points because of ties in the data in these instances we used the first change point the ranks r1 n of the y 1 n are used to calculate the pettitt statistic which is based on the mann whitney two sample test p k 2 i i r i k n 1 k 1 n the probable change point u is located at the k where the absolute value of p k is maximized u max 1 k n p k the approximate probability for a two sided test is calculated according to p v a l u e 2 e x p 6 u 2 n 3 n 2 hawkins and deng 2010 pettitt 1979 pohlert 2018 verstraeten et al 2006 2 4 7 the mann whitney test for change points the mann whitney test for change points is an implementation of a two sample nonparametric test for differences in location mann and whitney 1947 in a sequential manner so that multiple change points can be found ross 2015b the two sample test evaluates every possible way of splitting the series into two subseries sequentially as each new observation is added to the series the test statistic is compared to a threshold chosen to bound the false positive type 1 error rate ross 2015b the mann whitney test evaluates every possible way of splitting the series into two subseries sequentially as each new observation is added to the series all the change points that pass the threshold criterion are considered possible change points the test statistic for the mann whitney test is denoted u and is the smaller of u1 and u2 u 1 n 1 n 2 n 1 n 1 1 2 r 1 u 2 n 1 n 2 n 2 n 2 1 2 r 2 where r1 is the sum of the ranks for group 1 the values to the left of the change point in the peak streamflow series and r2 is the sum of the ranks for group 2 the values to the right of the change point in the peak streamflow series higgins 2003 because the test is based on a test statistic one would assume there would be an associated p value however the implementation of the test in the cpm r package does not return a p value instead of a returned p value the methods in cpm perform hypothesis tests sequentially and create an internal numerical simulation of the distribution of the test statistic the error rate is controlled by a quantity called the mean run length which is the arithmetic mean number of observations that do not have a change point before a false positive detection occurs the user can set a mean run length to one of several predetermined values ross undated all of these values are greater than the length of any of the series tested in this study therefore despite the fact that a p value is not returned it is reasonable to assume that the results are significant at conventional significance levels 0 01 or 0 05 given how the algorithm controls for the false positive rate 2 4 8 the mood two sample test for difference in scale the mood two sample test for differences in scale mood 1954 is favored over other nonparametric methods for differences in scale by ross et al 2011 because of its simple formulation and performance in power analysis the mood test assumes that the medians of the distributions on either side of the change point are equal and that the distribution differ only in the scale parameters taeger and kuhnt 2014 like the mann whitney test for change points in median the mood two sample test for difference in scale mood 1954 is implemented in a sequential manner to find multiple changes in scale ross 2015b a two sample test evaluates every possible way of splitting the series into two subseries sequentially as each new observation is added to the series the test statistic w calculated repeatedly at every change point in a sequential manner as each new observation is added is w i 1 n r i k n 1 2 2 if the y1 k s are dispersed relative to the yk 1 n s w will be relatively small mood 1954 like the mann whitney test one would assume there would be an associated p value however the implementation of the test in the cpm r package does not return a p value the error rate is controlled by the mean run length described in section 2 4 7 and it is reasonable to assume that the results are significant at conventional significance levels 2 5 comparison of methods for detecting change points in mean or median peak streamflow change point methods were compared based on their detection of induced change points in the simulated data section 2 1 and their false positive rates in the random series series with simulated trends and the series with simulated change points methods also were compared based on change points in observed peak streamflow data from across the united states with known major reservoir storage additions section 2 2 methods for detecting changes in central tendency were considered successful in finding a change point if the change point method chose a year 5 years from the actual year because picking the exact year is an unrealistic given the interannual variability of peak streamflows 2 6 national peak streamflow change points the methods considered best with high weight going to the false positive rate were used to find change points in location and scale for historical peak streamflow time series across the conterminous united states for change in location results are presented using a likelihood based approach which was proposed by hirsch et al 2015 as an alternative to simply reporting significant trends based on a significance level that would provide more descriptive language trend likelihood values were determined using the p value reported by the change point test using the equation 1 p v a l u e 2 when the trend is likely upward or likely downward the trend likelihood value associated with the trend is between 0 90 and 1 0 that is the chance of the trend occurring in the specified direction is at least 90 out of 100 when the trend is somewhat likely upward or somewhat likely downward the trend likelihood value associated with the trend is between 0 70 and 0 90 the chance of the trend occurring in the specified direction is between 70 and 90 out of 100 when the trend is about as likely as not the trend likelihood value associated with the trend is less than 0 70 the chance of the trend being either upward or downward is less than 70 out of 100 to clarify let us consider a change point in which median streamflow increased with a likelihood value of 0 80 using the traditional hypothesis testing approach and a traditional p value of either 0 05 or 0 01 the change point would be reported as nonsignificant using the likelihood based approach the change point would be reported instead as somewhat likely upward the traditional hypothesis testing approach could lead to a potentially false sense of security because it is interpreted as there being no proof of a change point the likelihood based approach shows instead that it is somewhat likely that a change point has occurred providing more information for decision makers likelihood values have been used to present national water quality trends oelsner et al 2017 ryberg et al 2019 u s geological survey 2017a and trends in ecological metrics zuellig and carlisle 2019 the presence of autocorrelation in a time series in the absence of a trend or after detrending violates the assumption of independence that change point tests have this can lead to the detection of non existent changes beaulieu et al 2009 in addition the existence of a trend or change point could cause an autocorrelation method to detect autocorrelation that is simply a function of the trend we examined the peak streamflow series and found that significant p value 0 05 lag one autocorrelation was present at 7 8 percent of 1465 streamflow streamgages for water years 1941 2015 significant correlation was present at 21 3 percent of regulated streamgages and 5 1 percent of hcdn streamgages minimal basin alterations we conclude that autocorrelation is not a major factor for change point interpretation for peak streamflows however the number of change points at regulated streamgages may be overestimated because of autocorrelation when finding changes in variance or scale in a time series with a known change in mean or median the power of the test is reduced by the presence of the changes in mean or median therefore the time series should be first adjusted for that change in the median nayak and villarini 2016 after the tests for change in location and scale in the peak streamflow series were selected the change points in location were determined when there was a statistically significant change the series were adjusted prior to the test for changes in scale the median adjusted change point for scale was determined by computing the pre and post step medians of peak streamflow magnitude and adding or subtracting the difference between the medians to the pre step time series for example if the pre step median is 1000 and the post step is 800 then 200 is subtracted from the pre step time series prior to testing for change point in scale 3 results 3 1 comparison of methods with simulated peak streamflow data the percent of the induced change points in central tendency detected in the simulated peak streamflow series section 2 1 was calculated as well as the mean number of false positives per series tested the results for the methods used to find change points in the mean or median are presented in table 2 as listed in table 2 most parametric methods do not perform well or at all for peak streamflow even after transformation to approximate normality the inability of the pelt and binary segmentation methods to find change points was concerning the code was checked and more simulations were run not shown the code was correct and it appeared that when the range of the data is narrow as when it has been transformed to base 10 logarithms the methods are insensitive to finding change points and only find changes of a large magnitude larger than any in the simulated data used for this study and larger than expected for most change points in peak streamflow the wbs method was the best of the parametric methods for tests of a change in the mean but had a much higher false positive rate than the nonparametric methods the nonparametric methods which test for a change in the median did not find all change points an expected result as some of the changes in the simulated data were small the nonparametric pelt method had the highest percentage of correct detection in the simulated data table 2 but having the highest false positive rate of the nonparametric methods offset the correct detections the pettitt test had the lowest false positive rate of the nonparametric methods for the simulated data table 2 despite an interest in finding multiple change points the low false positive rate of the pettitt test for randomly generated series without change points indicates that the pettitt test is the most appropriate change point method for analyzing historical peak streamflows because the parametric methods were not working for the peak streamflow even after logarithmic transformation parametric methods were dropped from consideration for changes in scale this left only the mood test therefore no comparisons are shown for changes in scale the mood test correctly found 29 67 percent of simulated change points in scale and had a mean of 0 39 false positives per series changes in scale 10 years of the actual change were considered correct because changes in variability are by definition more complex than changes in central tendency 3 2 comparison of methods for peak streamflow data with a substantial addition of reservoir storage a comparison of the change point method results at regulated streamgages is shown in table 3 these sites have a known major reservoir addition during their period of record section 2 2 these change points represent substantial changes in reservoir storage and some of the changes are larger than those in the simulated data given this all change point detection methods had better performance than for the simulated peak streamflow data section 3 1 however the nonparametric methods were still superior to the parametric methods the pettitt and the cpm mann whitney tests had similar results for correctly finding known change points which was expected because both are based on the nonparametric mann whitney test however the cpm mann whitney found almost 2 5 times as many false positives as the pettitt test this is a confirmation of the prior conclusion from the simulated data that the pettitt test is the most appropriate method for change point analyses of peak streamflows the mood method also was used to test for the changes in scale that generally happen after a substantial change in reservoir storage assuming all the large storage changes also resulted in a change in scale of the peak streamflow distribution before and after the reservoir the mood test was correct 24 68 percent of the time and the false positive rate was a mean of 0 17 false positives per series 3 3 historical peak streamflow change points across the conterminous united states the pettitt test was applied to peak streamflows in the three trend periods water years 1916 2015 1941 2015 and 1966 2015 the test finds a change point in the location median of peak streamflow in every series and returns a p value the p values and direction of the change were converted to likelihoods section 2 6 and are presented spatially in fig 1 spatial distribution is one aspect of the analysis but timing of changes and the magnitude of the changes also are of interest animations presenting the timing and spatial distribution of the changes in median are described and presented in the supplemental material for each of the three trend periods for water years 1941 2015 the timing and magnitude of the increases and decreases in the median for all basin categories combined are summarized in fig 2 change point results are summarized by basin category in table 4 all results are published in the associated data release dudley et al 2018 the mood test was then applied to the peak streamflow series in the three trend periods to analyze changes in scale spread or dispersion to improve the power of the mood test when statistically significant changes in the median were found with the pettitt test the series was adjusted to a consistent median the test found zero to four change points in every series returning the change point but not a p value in contrast to the pettitt test the mood test results indicate the presence or absence of a change point for each year the time series few series had more than one change point in scale although one series had four change points the direction of the change in scale for all change points is presented in fig 3 however it is difficult to show all of them on the map when they plot on top of each other animations presenting the timing and spatial distribution of the changes in scale are described and presented in the supplemental material for each of the three trend periods and the associated data release dudley et al 2018 contains the results for water years 1941 2015 the timing and magnitude of the increases and decreases in scale for all basins combined are summarized in fig 4 change point results for scale are summarized by basin category in table 5 4 discussion 4 1 comparison of results with previous studies in terms of selecting a change point method for changes in central tendency our results expand upon and confirm those of villarini et al 2009 who tested four multiple change point detection methods including the pettitt test and the bayesian method used in this study they used usgs peak streamflow at 47 streamgages with a qualification code indicating a change to regulated conditions and chose the pettitt test as the best one because of its performance in detecting known change points and its statistical properties of being robust to outliers and skewed distributions villarini et al 2009 we tested seven methods for change point detection in location with synthetic data and peak streamflow data with known change points from reservoir additions the pettitt test represents the best balance between detecting change points and having a low false detection rate the patterns shown in the change points in median peak streamflow across the conterminous united states using the pettitt test fig 1 are similar spatially to those shown for linear trends in the logarithm of peak streamflow at 200 long term 85 127 years of record streamgages by hirsch and ryberg 2012 see fig 1 in that there are clusters of increases north of 40 degrees latitude and east of 100 degrees longitude and in the pacific northwest also there are more decreases south of 40 degrees latitude and west of approximately 100 degrees longitude some of these sites may have both change points and linear trends or in some cases some of the linear trends may have been change points many of the change points are similar temporally to those of mccabe and wolock 2002 they used a monotonic trend method kendall s tau over varying trend periods for 400 streamgages from 1941 to 99 and hypothesized that many of the trends detected were step trends occurring around 1970 with increases more noticeable in annual minimum and median daily streamflow than annual maximum daily streamflow fig 2 shows a concentration of change points in the mid 1960s to the early 1970s that resulted in increased median peak streamflows perhaps the change point around 1970 is more evident in peak streamflow now than it was for mccabe and wolock 2002 with the 16 years of added data in the current study villarini et al 2009 used the pettitt test to detect change points at 50 streamgages with at least 100 years of record and found changes caused by changes in gauging practice changes in land use and land cover regulation by reservoirs and climatic reasons this highlights the importance of the metadata available for sites in gages ii and why we categorized the sites as hcdn regulated urban or uncategorized villarini et al 2009 showed that significant trends based on monotonic tests can be attributable to change points conversely significant change points can be attributed to monotonic trends the pettitt test has been found to be sensitive to the presence of trends and serial correlation busuioc and von storch 1996 sharma et al 2016 found that if both trends and step changes are present analyzing only one can be misleading therefore monotonic trends across the united states were analyzed in a parallel study to the current change point study hodgkins et al 2019 4 2 reasons for peak streamflow change points the streamgages in fig 1 represent a combination of minimally altered hcdn basins and other basins that are affected to varying degrees by reservoir additions urbanization and other alterations potentially affecting annual peak streamflows however the maps fig 1 show that there are strong spatial patterns in the increases and decreases indicating regional climatic changes as a driver of changes in peak streamflow in the conterminous united states the blue up arrows that are clustered in the midwest and northeast united states fig 1 particularly water years 1966 2015 coincide with the regions of the united states that have the largest increases in observed heavy precipitation in 1948 2012 mallakpour and villarini 2017 and very heavy precipitation defined as the heaviest 1 percent of all daily events in 1958 2016 easterling et al 2017 and that have previously been identified as having change points villarini and smith 2010 the pettitt test decreases in sensitivity with increasing variability is not as sensitive to change in the extremes of a distribution and can be sensitive to changes in scale therefore the results in this article possibly underestimate changes in central tendency in peak streamflow across the conterminous united states over the 100 and 75 year periods of record more change points from hcdn basins are increases than decreases in median while in the 50 year period more change points are decreases table 4 presumably because of the nature of hcdn basins these change points were caused by changes in climate for regulated basins most basins have decreases in median peak streamflow over the 100 and 75 year periods an expected result with increased reservoir storage although some decreases could also be partly because of drier climatic conditions in parts of the southwest united states in recent decades easterling et al 2017 however 14 22 percent of change points at regulated basins are an increase in median likely because of the large increases in very heavy precipitation in the midwest and northeast easterling et al 2017 having more effect on peak streamflows than additional reservoir storage at basins in this area for urban basins in the 75 and 50 year periods most of the change points are increases the 100 year period has only one urban streamgage this supports the conceptual expectation that urbanization increases annual peak streamflow although there may be an interaction with increased heavy precipitation at many streamgages as many urbanized basins with long term streamflow record are in the midwest and northeast at uncategorized streamgages across the country the percent of increases and decreases is roughly even making change points without added spatial and temporal information seem like a random process however the maps in fig 1 show that there are substantial spatial patterns in the increases and decreases indicating regional climatic and land use patterns as drivers of changes in peak streamflow the blue up arrows that are clustered in the midwest and northeastern united states fig 1 particularly water years 1966 2015 coincide with the areas of the united states that have the largest increases in observed very heavy precipitation defined as the heaviest 1 percent of all daily events 1958 2012 fig 2 19 of melillo et al 2014 changes in scale spread or dispersion of peak streamflows are dominated more by temporal patterns than the spatial patterns in the median change points similarly the patterns of the changes in location mean and scale variance also did not match in a study by pagano and garen 2005 that examined april september streamflow volumes for 141 unregulated basins in the western united states in our study more decreases in scale occurred earlier in the three periods tested whereas more increases occurred later in the periods fig 4 and supplemental material after 2000 all changes in scale were increases except one however the largest increases in scale happened prior to 1990 fig 4 a mix of increases and decreases in scale occurred across the conterminous united states without strong and cohesive regional patterns regulated sites show a pattern of decreasing scale occurring earlier in the period of record fig 4 consistent with the timing of most dam construction billington et al 2005 the largest percentage of change points in scale occurred at regulated basins for water years 1916 2015 48 percent with one change point table 5 which is expected with changes caused by additions of reservoirs over a lengthy period of record however changes in scale at regulated basins were not always decreases in scale perhaps because of climatic changes or reservoir management changes most hcdn basins with change points in scale showed an increase as with the change point in median these change points were likely caused by changes in climate because these sites are relatively undeveloped and suitable for analysis of climate related trends urban streamgages showed a higher rate of increases in scale than decreases uncategorized sites had similar percentages of increase and decreases fewer change points in scale were found for all basin types for water years 1966 2015 than for the two longer periods the ability to detect changes may decline with shorter periods of record and at many sites regulation occurred before 1966 other than noting patterns in change points at regulated urbanized and hcdn streamgages and general spatial and temporal patterns detailed attribution of specific change points at streamgages is beyond the scope of this paper however the ubiquity of change points is a concern for analyses of annual peak streamflow such as flood frequency analysis the recently released guidelines for determining flood flow frequency bulletin 17c specifically says that the procedures do not cover watersheds where flood flows are appreciably altered by reservoir regulation basin changes or hydrologic nonstationarities england et al 2018 p 2 and the work group that developed the guidelines did not evaluate methods to account for climate variability in flood frequency england et al 2018 p 23 advancements are needed in flood frequency analysis to address nonstationarities however it is important to note that as shown in the testing of change point methods and noted by salas et al 2018 change points can appear in random series or be a feature of low frequency components of the atmospheric and oceanic system stationarity should be the default assumption unless one can justify the nonstationarity assumption which should be based on physical understanding of the processes causing change points not solely on trend based interpretations of the at site information matalas 2012 salas et al 2018 serinaldi and kilsby 2015 5 conclusions change point analysis is an active area of research in statistics and an ongoing concern in hydrology because of advancements in methodology and computing many change point methods are now available but testing of methods on peak streamflow data has been limited in the most comprehensive test to date we tested seven methods for their ability to detect change points in the location central tendency and one method for its ability to detect change points in scale dispersion or spread of annual peak streamflows and the methods tendencies to find false positives tests included both simulated peak streamflow time series and peak streamflow data from streamgages across the conterminous united states with known major additions of reservoir storage our results show that the pettitt test has the best balance between detecting known change points and having a low rate of false positives parametric methods tested including a bayesian one do not perform well even when transforming peak streamflows to approximate normality by using logarithms nonparametric methods other than the pettitt test allow for more than one change point but have an unacceptable number of false positives because of the poor performance of parametric methods for changes in location only the mood test remained for examining changes points in scale change points in peak streamflow median and scale are abundant across the conterminous united states with the changes in median peaks showing regional patterns as well as a strong widespread increase in median peak streamflow around 1970 the regional and national patterns indicate that many of the changes are related to climate and include increases in peak streamflow at hcdn sites that are suitable for analyzing hydrologic variations caused by climatic changes most change points at regulated sites are decreases and most change points at urban sites are increases both patterns match what is expected under these altered regimes those change points in the opposite direction of what is expected likely represent an interaction with climate that is altering the expected regulation or urbanization signal the changes in scale of peak streamflows are dominated more by temporal than spatial patterns there were more streamgages with decreases in scale occurring in earlier decades than recent decades and more streamgages with increases in scale occurring in recent decades than earlier decades regulated sites show a pattern of decreasing scale occurring earlier in the period of record consistent with the timing of most dam construction across the united states the many change points in median and scale of peak streamflow highlight the care with which analysts need to approach flood frequency analyses that rely on assumptions of stationarity basin specific attribution of these change points at the hundreds of basins with high likelihood of change is an important next step in understanding the hydrologic regime

5767,as one of the largest arid and semiarid areas in the world central asia ca has been facing severe water crisis agricultural irrigation consumes most water resources there however it is not clear how the irrigation water requirement iwr varies spatially and temporally in ca especially under co2 fertilization and land use change this study for the first time quantifies changes of iwr for two predominant crops cotton and winter wheat over ca under two climate change scenarios rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 both of which consider co2 fertilization effects and land use projections our results show that without considering atmospheric co2 concentration for estimating iwr would result in large errors and even different signs of the changes in the future iwr for cotton and winter wheat tends to increase in 2020s and 2040s but decrease in 2060s and 2080s under rcp2 6 and co2 fertilization the change magnitude is less than 5 under rcp4 5 and co2 fertilization most areas in ca exhibit an increase of less than 5 the maximum increases of 5 15 for cotton occur in tajikistan the maximum increase of more than 50 for winter wheat occurs in tajikistan under both climate scenarios the iwr in turkmenistan is most sensitive to land use change with 33 increase compared with iwr in 2015 the other four countries have small differences less than 10 between 2015 and 2030 severe water security pressure is predicted in turkmenistan and uzbekistan and the smallest in tajikistan this study provides a comprehensive evaluation of iwr for the central asian countries in the future and helps the decision maker for sensible water management keywords irrigation water requirement future climate scenarios co2 fertilization central asia land use cover 1 introduction central asia ca stretching from the caspian sea in the west to china in the east and from afghanistan in the south to russia in the north faces enormous challenges with regard to the scarcity and pronounced inter annual variability of water resources a report from the united nations environment programme unep pointed out that climate change is threatening access to water and farming in ca unep 2017 surface air temperature ta has an increasing rate of 0 18 degreesc decade 1 over ca and the annual precipitation in ca has apparently increased in winter during the past 80 years chen et al 2009 2011 agriculture is a major sector in the economy of ca agricultural irrigation consumes most of the water resources in the five central asian countries including kazakhstan kaz kyrgyzstan kgz tajikistan tjk turkmenistan tkm anduzbekistan uzb therefore quantifying the impact of future climate change on irrigation water requirement iwr in ca is crucial for water resources management and for maintaining the sustainable development of agriculture the iwr is significantly affected by climate change due to the increase in ta the fluctuations in precipitation pr and the increase of atmospheric co2 concentration table 1 summarizes some key studies estimating future climate change impacts on iwr at regional and global scales for instances döll 2002 estimated that the global total iwr would increase by 5 8 in response to climate change until the 2070s similarly remarkable increase of iwr was found by 2080 fischer et al 2007 wada et al 2013 found that iwr will considerably increase by more than 20 in the northern hemisphere during the summer by 2100 iwr of rice in songkhram river basin in thailand is expected to increase in the future boonwichai et al 2018 in contrast saadi et al 2015 pointed out iwr under optimal water supply may decrease by 11 for wheat and 5 for tomato due to the shorter growing periods in the mediterranean region during 2036 2065 konzmann et al 2013 projected that it is highly likely that global irrigation demand will decrease by 17 and increase by 20 for some regions including southern europe in our knowledge there are no similar studies reporting on central asia where irrigation is so important since decline of the aral sea severe soil salinity or degradation of the ecosystems is all related with the irrigation activity therefore it is crucial to understand potential future iwr changes under climate and land use changes in ca although some studies have calculated the future iwr at global scale including the region of ca co2 fertilization effects on iwr are not considered in those studies but are evaluated in this study in addition this study considers bias correction in estimating regional iwr since process based global model is often biased because of inaccurate model parameterization this paper aims to investigate the climate change including co2 fertilization impact on iwr and to explore the spatiotemporal variations in iwr of major crops in ca under future climate scenarios and land use projections follows are specific objectives i investigating the co2 fertilization impact on future iwr to check to what extent the increasing co2 concentration could reduce iwr ii clarifying the variations in iwr of cotton and winter wheat in ca under future climate scenarios iii projecting the total amount of irrigation water in the near future due to land use change and iv presenting the situations of the future iwr for the five central asian countries the remaining paper is setup as follows section 2 introduces the study area section 3 describes the methodology and the data sections 4 and 5 present major results and discussion section 6 summarizes conclusions of this paper 2 study area this study investigates iwr in the future over the five central asian countries fig 1 shows the land use map of 2015 in this region it is seen that rainfed cropland and irrigated cropland account for 9 5 and 5 5 of the study area respectively most of the rainfed cropland is located in the northern kaz irrigation cropland is mainly located in the southeast of kaz and in uzb sparse vegetation and bare soil cover 40 of the area the areas of the irrigated cropland for kaz kgz tjk tkm anduzb are listed in table 2 central asia is one of the largest arid and semiarid areas in the world during the twentieth century average annual precipitation was 260 mm year in the aral sea region there are more than 80 of irrigation water in the aral sea region diverted from rivers that flow into the aral sea resulting in the aral sea desiccation asokan et al 2016 water resources between the five central asian countries are very unevenly distributed tjk andkgz have more water resources than the other three countries on one hand tjk andkgz are located in the mountain areas with relatively high annual precipitation table 2 in contrast uzb tkm kaz only have average annual rainfall of 264 mm year 191 mm year and 250 mm year respectively on the other hand the amu river and the syr river provide abundant water supply for tjk and kgz compared to these two countries water scarcity in uzb tkm and kaz is more severe winter wheat and cotton are the main crops in ca the statistics from the food and agriculture organization fao in 2015 show winter wheat and cotton account for majority area of the irrigation cropland table 2 for kaz kgz tjk tkm and uzb respectively therefore we only consider these two crops for calculating iwr under future climate change scenarios 3 data and methodology 3 1 data climate change data including the maximum air temperature ta the minimum ta and precipitation pr were obtained from fifteen global climate models gcms see supplementary table 1 in the fifth coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 the data have been downscaled and bias corrected on the basis of a statistical downscaling technique monthly bias correction and spatial disaggregation bcsd brekke et al 2013 the data has a spatial resolution of 0 5 degree spanning from 2006 to 2100 the traditional simple multi model averaging method was used to estimate the averages of the maximum and the minimum ta and pr from the fifteen models which performs better than any individual model for estimating climatic and hydrologic variables duan and phillips 2010 pincus et al 2008 reichler and kim 2008 the averages were then utilized to calculate the reference evapotranspiration et0 and thereby iwr we considered two representative concentration pathways rcp 2 6 and rcp4 5 as the future climate scenarios rcp2 6 is a peak and decline scenario that first reaches radiative forcing at around 3 1 w m 2 by the mid 21st century and returns to 2 6 w m 2 by 2100 rcp4 5 is a stabilization scenario with radiative forcing at 4 5 w m 2 in the year 2100 the extreme scenario of rcp8 5 was not considered in this study atmospheric co2 concentration was included in calculating iwr the co2 concentration data corresponding to rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 were obtained from meinshausen et al 2011 co2 concentration increases from 381 ppm to 421 ppm under rcp2 6 and from 2006 to 2100 and from 381 ppm to 538 ppm under rcp4 5 during the same period the 300 m resolution land use data were obtained from land cover product of european space agency climate change initiative esa cci for predicting future land use types we first built transition suitability images using driving forces of pr ta dem slope distance to rivers and population density the pr and ta data were obtained from climatic research unit harris et al 2014 the dem and population density data were obtained from shuttle radar topography mission http srtm csi cgiar org srtmdata and from socioeconomic data and applications center https sedac ciesin columbia edu data collection gpw v4 respectively the river data were downloaded from the website of http www naturalearthdata com the slope was calculated according to the dem data using arcgis software 3 2 calculation of the irrigation water requirements the modified penman monteith method and the fao recommended crop coefficient approach were used to calculate iwr of winter wheat and cotton it includes five procedures 1 calculation of the crop reference evapotranspiration et0 based on the modified penman monteith equation 2 determination of the crop coefficients kc for winter wheat and cotton 3 estimation of the actual evapotranspiration et from et0 and kc 4 determination of the effective rainfall pe based on the fao method and 5 calculation of iwr for winter wheat and cotton these procedure details are described in sections 3 2 1 3 2 4 3 2 1 calculation of crop reference evapotranspiration the reference evapotranspiration was estimated using a modified fao penman monteith equation presented by yang et al 2019 eq 1 which incorporated a relationship between atmospheric co2 concentration and surface resistance into the fao penman monteith equation eq 2 detailed derivation of this relationship can be found in yang et al 2019 the feature of this equation is that it accounts for the effects of atmospheric co2 concentration on surface resistance and thereby crop transpiration previous studies fischer et al 2007 konzmann et al 2013 saadi et al 2015 proved that there was large difference of iwr with and without considering the effects of co2 concentration on crop transpiration atmospheric co2 concentration has been increasing in the past decades baker et al 2018 and is expected to increase further therefore it is necessary to add atmospheric co2 concentration for calculating iwr to quantify the difference of iwr with and without consideration of co2 the original fao penman monteith equation was also used to calculate iwr without including co2 which is represented as iwrno hereafter iwr with co2 effects is represented as iwrco2 in the paper 1 e t 0 c o 2 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 u 2 0 34 2 4 10 4 c o 2 300 2 e t 0 n o 0 408 δ r n

literature of allen et al 1998 and yang et al 2019 they were estimated from the maximum and minimum air temperatures and the latitude of different grids in this study 3 2 2 crop coefficients and evapotranspiration for winter wheat and cotton kc is a coefficient related to crop type and to crop growth stage according to the fao manual four crop growth stages were recommended the initial stage the crop development stage the mid season stage and the late season stage kc values are different in the four stages in the study we use kc values of winter wheat and cotton for each growth stage and the crop calendar provided from the database at the scientific information centre of interstate commission on water coordination in ca sic icwc stulina 2010 conrad et al 2013 table 3 presents the details on the basis of et0 co2 et0 no and kc actual evapotranspiration under non limited irrigation et is calculated by eq 3 3 e t et 0 k c 3 2 3 determination of effective rainfall the effective

125 0 2 p 125 p 250 m m 125 0 1 p p 250 m m where p is the monthly precipitation 3 2 4 calculation of iwr for winter wheat and cotton on the basis of et pe and the irrigation efficiency ie iwr is calculated from eq 5 5 i w r et p e i e ie is the ratio between irrigation water actually utilized by growing crops and water diverted from a source in this study we used the result presented by rost et al 2008 in which ie in central asia was estimated as 0 566 according to the eqs 1 5 iwrco2 and iwrno of cotton and winter wheat from 2006 to 2100 are calculated under the scenarios of rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 for the whole area of the five central asian countries it should be pointed out that the actual distributions of cotton or winter wheat are not considered during the calculation the results are a projection of iwr assuming that either cotton or winter wheat is grown in the whole area 3 3 predicting land use types in 2030 this study took the land use data of esa cci of 2000 and 2015 as baseline and used the ca markov method for predicting the land use cover in 2030 over ca the ca markov method is widely used for predicting land use types sang et al 2011 mas et al 2014 hou et al 2019 yang et al 2019 which includes three major procedures i using the markov method to produce the transition probability matrix the transition areas matrix and a set of conditional probability images over the period between 2000 and 2015 ii using the ca markov method to predict the land use cover in 2030 the inputs include a basis land cover image which is the land use cover in 2015 the transition areas matrix and the conditional probability images produced in procedure i suitability maps constructed from driving factors of land use change and iii at last a 5 5 contiguity filter is used to down weight the suitability of pixels that are distant from existing instances of the land cover type under consideration 3 4 validating ca markov method it is always important to quantify the predictability of the ca markov method in this region since we have three stages 2005 2010 and 2015 of land use types we firstly used cci data of 2005 and 2010 together with the ca markov method described in section 3 3 for predicting the land use types of 2015 we then used kappa index to evaluate its predictability by comparing the predicted and actual land use data in 2015 the kappa index pontius 2000 is defined as 6 k a p p a p 0 p c p p p c where p0 is the proportion of correct simulation pc is the expected proportion of correct simulation in random circumstances and pp is the proportion of correct simulation in ideal circumstances kappa 0 8 indicates high consistency and kappa 0 40 indicates poor consistency yang et al 2019 fu et al 2018 our result of kappa index between the predicted and the actual land cover in 2015 is 0 84 which indicates the ca markov method is sufficient for this study 3 5 the mann kendall method the mann kendall test is used for testing the trend of iwr which is an excellent tool for trend detection burn and elnur 2002 two parameters of the slope β and the significance indicate the direction as well as the magnitude of the trend in the study positive values of β represent an increasing trend conversely negative values represent a decreasing trend the significance of the trend was evaluated at 0 05 level 4 results 4 1 the effects of the increasing atmospheric co2 concentration on iwr atmospheric co2 concentration has effects on iwr by reducing stomatal opening and thereby reducing crop transpiration yang et al 2019 this section gives the comparisons between iwrco2 and iwrno by which the reduction of iwr due to the increasing co2 concentration in the future is illustrated firstly we compare the changing trends of iwrco2 and iwrno from 2006 to 2100 which are obtained using the mann kendall method fig 2 displays the areas with significant iwrco2 and iwrno trends at 0 05 level for cotton and winter wheat under rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 respectively it is obvious that the trend of iwrco2 is completely different with iwrno under rcp2 6 significant decline trend in the northeast of ca and no significant change in the other areas were found for iwrco2 of cotton and winter wheat however iwrno has no obvious changes in the northeast of ca and has significant increases in the other areas under rcp4 5 iwrco2 and iwrno both have increasing trends for the two crops their difference is that the magnitude of the increasing trend of iwrco2 is 0 5 less than iwrno for illustrating the difference of the future variations between iwrco2 and iwrno further the relative changes of iwrco2 and iwrno in the four periods 2020s 2021 2040 2040s 2041 2060 2060s 2061 2080 2080s 2081 2100 compared to current condition i e 2006s 2006 2020 were computed respectively furthermore fig 3 summarizes the differences between the relative changes of iwrco2 and that of iwrno which can quantitatively indicate the effects of co2 fertilization on the magnitude of future variations of iwr fig 3 shows that the relative changes of iwrno are 0 5 larger than that of iwrco2 for cotton over the whole ca for winter wheat the differences between the relative changes of iwrco2 and that of iwrno are also less than 5 in most areas of ca however the areas in east ca mostly in kgz and in east kaz exhibit a difference of 5 10 and the southeast ca mostly in tjk exhibit a difference of more than 50 these indicate that co2 fertilization would reduce the relative changes of iwr of less than 5 in most areas of ca in tjk the reduction due to co2 fertilization is the largest the above results are based on the iwr across the whole ca to focus on the iwr in the cropland and to evaluate the co2 fertilization impacts on the total amount of irrigation water for each of the five countries fig 4 summarizes the change differences of the medians of iwrco2 and iwrno in the cropland between 2015 and 2030 for the five countries under rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 and fig 5 summarizes the change differences of the total amount of irrigation water between 2015 and 2030 total amount of irrigation water is calculated by multiplying the medians of iwrco2 iwrno with the cropland areas the cropland areas in 2030 were projected with the ca markov method see section 3 3 it is clear from fig 4 that there are very different changes between iwrco2 and iwrno in some cases there even exist opposite change signs for example the opposite sign for cotton in kaz under rcp2 6 the opposite sign for winter wheat in tjk under rcp2 6 and in kaz and tkm under rcp4 5 despite of large spatial difference there is no large difference between the total amount of irrigation water considering co2 fertilization and that without considering co2 fertilization see fig 5 this indicates the spatial difference is cancelled when aggregated to the total difference based on the above analysis it is clear that compared to iwrco2 without including co2 fertilization for estimating iwr results in very different change results in some regions and could lead to wrong conclusions in some cases the sign change can also be different therefore it is necessary using iwrco2 for appropriate evaluations of climate change impact on iwr in sections of 4 2 4 5 we use iwrco2 for our analysis to introduce the spatial and temporal changes of iwr over ca 4 2 the trend of iwrco2 of cotton and winter wheat in the future fig 2 in section 4 1 displays the area with significant iwrco2 trends at 0 05 level for cotton and winter wheat under rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 respectively it is clear that iwrco2 for the two crops has significantly increased in the most area under rcp4 5 the values in most areas of uzb and tkm are 0 5 1 0 the increasing trend in tjk is the largest with the slope values of 1 0 1 5 the increasing magnitude of cotton is larger than that of winter wheat over kaz it is also seen that the increasing trend becomes larger from the north to the south under rcp4 5 under rcp2 6 significant decrease trend in iwrco2 is identified in the northeastern kaz there are no obvious changes of iwrco2 in uzb tkm tjk and kgz the above results illustrate that iwrco2 for cotton and winter wheat would decrease over ca under rcp2 6 and increase under rcp4 5 the largest increase under rcp4 5 occurs in tjk 4 3 the relative changes of iwrco2 of cotton and winter wheat in the future for illustrating the future variations of iwrco2 of cotton and winter wheat clearly the medians of iwrco2 in the four periods 2020s 2040s 2060s 2080s are compared with that of current condition i e 2006s fig 6 and fig 7 summarize the relative iwrco2 changes for cotton and winter wheat respectively it can be seen from fig 6 that iwrco2 of cotton under rcp2 6 increases at first and then decreases comparing with that in 2006s in 2020s and 2040s iwrco2 of cotton increases by less than 5 over the whole ca in 2060s and 2080s most areas exhibit a decrease of 0 5 this is related to the peak and decline pattern of radiative forcing in rcp2 6 which first reaches radiative forcing at around 3 1 w m 2 by 2050 and returns to 2 6 w m 2 by 2100 comparatively the increase in iwrco2 is more obvious under rcp4 5 with iwrco2 increasing by 5 in all the four periods the areas in the southeast exhibit the large increase of 5 15 in 2060s and 2080s where tjk and kgz are located fig 7 shows that iwrco2 trend for winter wheat is similar to that for cotton under rcp2 6 with increases at first and then decreases in 2060s and 2080s the increases in 2020s and 2040s are less than 5 in most areas in 2060s and 2080s the north areas have decreases of 5 the southeastern mountain areas exhibit the largest increase with more than 50 increase in some areas this is different from the cotton pattern for which there does not exist large change in the southeastern areas different from the pattern under rcp2 6 iwrco2 for winter wheat is decreased in some eastern areas in 2020s and 2040s under rcp4 5 while these areas show 5 increases in 2060s and 2080s the largest increase occurs in the southern ca including western tjk eastern uzb and southern tkm the highest increase of 50 occurs in the western tjk the above results indicate that under rcp2 6 iwrco2 of both cotton and winter wheat shows increasing patterns in 2020s and 2040s and decreasing patterns in 2060s and 2080s the southeastern mountain region of ca has the largest increases of iwrco2 for the two crops under the two climate scenarios the increase of iwrco2 under rcp4 5 is more significant than that under rcp2 6 in comparison with cotton winter wheat exhibits larger changes of iwrco2 in the southeastern mountain areas iwrco2 in tjk is more sensitive to the climate change 4 4 iwrco2 of the five central asian countries in the future fig 8 shows iwrco2 of uzb and kaz in the five periods uzb and kaz constitute high proportions of the total agricultural land in ca compared to the other three the medians of iwrco2 of cotton and winter wheat during the periods of 2006s and 2080s for the five countries under rcp 2 6 and rcp 4 5 were summarized in supplementary table 3 it can be seen from fig 8 that iwrco2 of winter wheat is lower than that of cotton because precipitation in ca usually occurs during the winter mainly between october and april during winter wheat growing seasons the water requirement for irrigation is low in addition fig 8 shows that the absolute differences of iwrco2 for cotton or winter wheat between the five periods are not significant for both rcp 2 6 and rcp 4 5 which corresponds to the results shown in section 4 2 that the relative changes of iwrco2 are less than 5 in most areas of ca fig 8 also shows that both crops have the increasing pattern initially in 2020s and 2040s and then the decreasing pattern in 2060s and 2080s under rcp2 6 in summary among the five countries tkm has the largest iwrco2 for cotton or winter wheat followed by uzb and then kaz tjk and kgz located in the mountainous areas have low iwrco2 mainly driven by the high precipitation there it should be pointed out that iwrco2 of winter wheat not shown in the paper is negative in some areas in kgz and tjk where mean precipitation can meet the irrigation requirements 4 5 the predictions of the land use cover in 2030 and the corresponding changes of iwrco2 this section shows the effects of land use change and focuses on iwrco2 in the cropland the transition probabilities of land use cover from 2015 to 2030 see supplementary table 2 show that the transitions from irrigated cropland to other land use types account for 28 4 18 8 of which are changed as urban areas respectively some other land types transferred to irrigated cropland as a whole the irrigated cropland is 254 161 km2 in 2015 and is projected to increase to 256 466 km2 in 2030 over ca there is an increase of 2305 km2 approximately 0 9 of baseline irrigated land area for clarifying the changes of iwrco2 due to the change of cropland and its effects on the total amount of irrigation water table 4 lists the areas of the irrigated cropland the medians of iwrco2 the total amount of water for irrigation in 2015 and in 2030 respectively for the five counties table 4 shows that except tkm the other four counties all have some decreases of the areas of the irrigated cropland from 2015 to 2030 conversely tkm has a large increase of 30 5 from 40 233 km2 in 2015 to 52 516 km2 in 2030 kaz has the largest area of the irrigated cropland the next is uzb followed by tkm kgz and tjk the comparisons of the medians of iwrco2 for cotton or for winter wheat between the five countries show that tkm has the maximum iwrco2 the next is uzb followed by kaz and tjk and kgz has the minimum iwrco2 the total amount of water for irrigation is estimated using the areas of the irrigated cropland and the median iwrco2 because kaz and uzb have much larger irrigated cropland than the other three countries and tkm has the largest iwrco2 large amount of irrigation water are required in kaz uzb and tkm tjk has the minimum coverage of the irrigated cropland and requires the minimum amount of water for irrigation we further analyze if water supply can meet water use in ca in terms of the aquastat data of fao http www fao org nr water aquastat water use index stm total renewable freshwater supply for kaz kgz tjk tkm and uzb in 2011 are 107 5 km3 23 6 km3 21 9 km3 24 8 km3 and 48 9 km3 respectively compared with the total irrigation water of cotton it is clear that water supply is far less than the total irrigation water for cotton in kaz kgz tkm and uzb especially in tkm and uzb this means that if the irrigated cropland is primarily cultivated with cotton the gap between the water supply and the water use would be very large and the water scarcity in ca would get worse in comparison the water supply is obviously higher than iwrco2 for kaz kgz and tjk if the cropland in the three countries is primarily cultivated with winter wheat suggesting water supply in the three countries can meet iwrco2 for winter wheat however for tkm and uzb the gap between the water supply and iwrco2 for winter wheat is still very large although it is less than the gap of cotton the total amount of irrigation water between 2015 and 2030 shows large increases for tkm about 28 km3 for cotton and 17 km3 for winter wheat 33 increase compared to 2015 due to the significant increase of cropland the other four countries have small differences about 1 10 km3 less than 10 compared to 2015 between 2015 and 2030 therefore cropland use change has large effects on the total irrigation water use in tkm 5 discussion the large increase of atmospheric co2 concentration in recent decades has been an apparent indication of climate change by changing atmospheric radiative forcing reducing plant transpiration stimulating photosynthesis and improving water use efficiency atmospheric co2 concentration has led to dramatic influences on surface radiation budget water balance crop yield crop irrigation requirement and ecosystem carbon cycle etc it involves all kinds of the aspects of social and natural system the impacts of atmospheric co2 concentration on iwr mainly reflect in its effects on vegetation transpiration by two pathways the first is direct in which a higher co2 concentration drives partial stomatal closure and consequently indirectly increases surface resistance the second is indirect in which the climate response to elevated co2 concentration leads to a higher atmospheric vapor pressure deficit that also reduces the stomatal opening yang et al 2019 if the elevated co2 concentration in the future is not considered in the projection of et0 et0 would be obviously overestimated which could cause some inadequate and even wrong conclusions for example some studies cook et al 2014 feng and fu 2013 have concluded a substantial drying trend over global terrestrial environments towards the end of the twenty first century in terms of the classic aridity index the ratio of precipitation to et0 however this has been proved to be inadequate because of the overestimation of et0 without considering the effect of elevated co2 concentration roderick et al 2015 swann et al 2016 this study further corroborates the overestimated et0 in ca causing the overestimation of iwr presently there are only few studies about the global future iwr that consider the effects of co2 fertilization on iwr over ca however because of the different climate scenarios different methods different crop types and different baseline periods used their results are somewhat inconsistent with the results presented in this study for instance the study by wada et al 2013 shows that the ensemble mean of iwr estimated from seven global hydrological models driven by climate forcing from five global climate models to estimate iwr has an increasing trend in the irrigated cropland in ca in 2080s 2069 2099 compared to the 2000s 1980 2010 under rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 however our results show there exist decreases in 2080s in some areas of ca especially under rcp2 6 figs 6 and 7 in wada et al 2013 a distinct decreasing trend of iwr is projected by lpjml model which is the only model considering co2 fertilization effects on crop photosynthesis and transpiration while the other six models project a consistent increase of iwr resulting in the increasing trend in the ensemble mean of iwr the different performances between lpjml and the other six also illustrate that with and without considering co2 fertilization effects in the estimation of iwr would result in opposite conclusions it is noted that this study uses an extreme assumption that either cotton or winter wheat is grown in the whole region this is because we cannot exactly predict where cotton or winter wheat is planted in the next several decades this extreme assumption may help to understand the iwr variation over the whole ca furthermore this paper has following limitations first the potential changes of the crop growing periods due to climate change are not taken into account in calculating iwr second fertilizer impacts on iwr are not considered as well these factors may cause some uncertainties in our iwr calculations 6 conclusions in the five central asian countries irrigation accounts for most of their water withdrawal 66 for kaz 93 for kgz 91 for tjk 94 3 for tkm and 90 for uzb according to fao therefore it is important to study the irrigation water requirement in the future this study investigates the iwr changes for cotton and winter wheat under climate change scenarios including co2 fertilization and land use change over ca it is clear that with and without considering co2 concentration for estimating iwr can result in large difference co2 fertilization would reduce the relative changes of iwr of less than 5 in most areas of ca in tjk the reduction due to co2 fertilization is the largest in the future iwr of cotton and winter wheat have increasing patterns in 2020s and 2040s and decreasing in 2060s and 2080s under rcp2 6 the magnitude change is less than 5 under rcp4 5 most areas in ca exhibit an increase of less than 5 the maximum increases of 5 15 for cotton occur in tjk the maximum increase of more than 50 for winter wheat occurs in tjk under both climate scenarios the results of the land use change on iwr indicate that iwr in tkm is most sensitive to land use change with 33 increase compared with iwr in 2015 the other four countries have small differences less than 10 between 2015 and 2030 water security pressure is predicted severe in tkm and uzb and the smallest in tjk declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

5767,as one of the largest arid and semiarid areas in the world central asia ca has been facing severe water crisis agricultural irrigation consumes most water resources there however it is not clear how the irrigation water requirement iwr varies spatially and temporally in ca especially under co2 fertilization and land use change this study for the first time quantifies changes of iwr for two predominant crops cotton and winter wheat over ca under two climate change scenarios rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 both of which consider co2 fertilization effects and land use projections our results show that without considering atmospheric co2 concentration for estimating iwr would result in large errors and even different signs of the changes in the future iwr for cotton and winter wheat tends to increase in 2020s and 2040s but decrease in 2060s and 2080s under rcp2 6 and co2 fertilization the change magnitude is less than 5 under rcp4 5 and co2 fertilization most areas in ca exhibit an increase of less than 5 the maximum increases of 5 15 for cotton occur in tajikistan the maximum increase of more than 50 for winter wheat occurs in tajikistan under both climate scenarios the iwr in turkmenistan is most sensitive to land use change with 33 increase compared with iwr in 2015 the other four countries have small differences less than 10 between 2015 and 2030 severe water security pressure is predicted in turkmenistan and uzbekistan and the smallest in tajikistan this study provides a comprehensive evaluation of iwr for the central asian countries in the future and helps the decision maker for sensible water management keywords irrigation water requirement future climate scenarios co2 fertilization central asia land use cover 1 introduction central asia ca stretching from the caspian sea in the west to china in the east and from afghanistan in the south to russia in the north faces enormous challenges with regard to the scarcity and pronounced inter annual variability of water resources a report from the united nations environment programme unep pointed out that climate change is threatening access to water and farming in ca unep 2017 surface air temperature ta has an increasing rate of 0 18 degreesc decade 1 over ca and the annual precipitation in ca has apparently increased in winter during the past 80 years chen et al 2009 2011 agriculture is a major sector in the economy of ca agricultural irrigation consumes most of the water resources in the five central asian countries including kazakhstan kaz kyrgyzstan kgz tajikistan tjk turkmenistan tkm anduzbekistan uzb therefore quantifying the impact of future climate change on irrigation water requirement iwr in ca is crucial for water resources management and for maintaining the sustainable development of agriculture the iwr is significantly affected by climate change due to the increase in ta the fluctuations in precipitation pr and the increase of atmospheric co2 concentration table 1 summarizes some key studies estimating future climate change impacts on iwr at regional and global scales for instances döll 2002 estimated that the global total iwr would increase by 5 8 in response to climate change until the 2070s similarly remarkable increase of iwr was found by 2080 fischer et al 2007 wada et al 2013 found that iwr will considerably increase by more than 20 in the northern hemisphere during the summer by 2100 iwr of rice in songkhram river basin in thailand is expected to increase in the future boonwichai et al 2018 in contrast saadi et al 2015 pointed out iwr under optimal water supply may decrease by 11 for wheat and 5 for tomato due to the shorter growing periods in the mediterranean region during 2036 2065 konzmann et al 2013 projected that it is highly likely that global irrigation demand will decrease by 17 and increase by 20 for some regions including southern europe in our knowledge there are no similar studies reporting on central asia where irrigation is so important since decline of the aral sea severe soil salinity or degradation of the ecosystems is all related with the irrigation activity therefore it is crucial to understand potential future iwr changes under climate and land use changes in ca although some studies have calculated the future iwr at global scale including the region of ca co2 fertilization effects on iwr are not considered in those studies but are evaluated in this study in addition this study considers bias correction in estimating regional iwr since process based global model is often biased because of inaccurate model parameterization this paper aims to investigate the climate change including co2 fertilization impact on iwr and to explore the spatiotemporal variations in iwr of major crops in ca under future climate scenarios and land use projections follows are specific objectives i investigating the co2 fertilization impact on future iwr to check to what extent the increasing co2 concentration could reduce iwr ii clarifying the variations in iwr of cotton and winter wheat in ca under future climate scenarios iii projecting the total amount of irrigation water in the near future due to land use change and iv presenting the situations of the future iwr for the five central asian countries the remaining paper is setup as follows section 2 introduces the study area section 3 describes the methodology and the data sections 4 and 5 present major results and discussion section 6 summarizes conclusions of this paper 2 study area this study investigates iwr in the future over the five central asian countries fig 1 shows the land use map of 2015 in this region it is seen that rainfed cropland and irrigated cropland account for 9 5 and 5 5 of the study area respectively most of the rainfed cropland is located in the northern kaz irrigation cropland is mainly located in the southeast of kaz and in uzb sparse vegetation and bare soil cover 40 of the area the areas of the irrigated cropland for kaz kgz tjk tkm anduzb are listed in table 2 central asia is one of the largest arid and semiarid areas in the world during the twentieth century average annual precipitation was 260 mm year in the aral sea region there are more than 80 of irrigation water in the aral sea region diverted from rivers that flow into the aral sea resulting in the aral sea desiccation asokan et al 2016 water resources between the five central asian countries are very unevenly distributed tjk andkgz have more water resources than the other three countries on one hand tjk andkgz are located in the mountain areas with relatively high annual precipitation table 2 in contrast uzb tkm kaz only have average annual rainfall of 264 mm year 191 mm year and 250 mm year respectively on the other hand the amu river and the syr river provide abundant water supply for tjk and kgz compared to these two countries water scarcity in uzb tkm and kaz is more severe winter wheat and cotton are the main crops in ca the statistics from the food and agriculture organization fao in 2015 show winter wheat and cotton account for majority area of the irrigation cropland table 2 for kaz kgz tjk tkm and uzb respectively therefore we only consider these two crops for calculating iwr under future climate change scenarios 3 data and methodology 3 1 data climate change data including the maximum air temperature ta the minimum ta and precipitation pr were obtained from fifteen global climate models gcms see supplementary table 1 in the fifth coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 the data have been downscaled and bias corrected on the basis of a statistical downscaling technique monthly bias correction and spatial disaggregation bcsd brekke et al 2013 the data has a spatial resolution of 0 5 degree spanning from 2006 to 2100 the traditional simple multi model averaging method was used to estimate the averages of the maximum and the minimum ta and pr from the fifteen models which performs better than any individual model for estimating climatic and hydrologic variables duan and phillips 2010 pincus et al 2008 reichler and kim 2008 the averages were then utilized to calculate the reference evapotranspiration et0 and thereby iwr we considered two representative concentration pathways rcp 2 6 and rcp4 5 as the future climate scenarios rcp2 6 is a peak and decline scenario that first reaches radiative forcing at around 3 1 w m 2 by the mid 21st century and returns to 2 6 w m 2 by 2100 rcp4 5 is a stabilization scenario with radiative forcing at 4 5 w m 2 in the year 2100 the extreme scenario of rcp8 5 was not considered in this study atmospheric co2 concentration was included in calculating iwr the co2 concentration data corresponding to rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 were obtained from meinshausen et al 2011 co2 concentration increases from 381 ppm to 421 ppm under rcp2 6 and from 2006 to 2100 and from 381 ppm to 538 ppm under rcp4 5 during the same period the 300 m resolution land use data were obtained from land cover product of european space agency climate change initiative esa cci for predicting future land use types we first built transition suitability images using driving forces of pr ta dem slope distance to rivers and population density the pr and ta data were obtained from climatic research unit harris et al 2014 the dem and population density data were obtained from shuttle radar topography mission http srtm csi cgiar org srtmdata and from socioeconomic data and applications center https sedac ciesin columbia edu data collection gpw v4 respectively the river data were downloaded from the website of http www naturalearthdata com the slope was calculated according to the dem data using arcgis software 3 2 calculation of the irrigation water requirements the modified penman monteith method and the fao recommended crop coefficient approach were used to calculate iwr of winter wheat and cotton it includes five procedures 1 calculation of the crop reference evapotranspiration et0 based on the modified penman monteith equation 2 determination of the crop coefficients kc for winter wheat and cotton 3 estimation of the actual evapotranspiration et from et0 and kc 4 determination of the effective rainfall pe based on the fao method and 5 calculation of iwr for winter wheat and cotton these procedure details are described in sections 3 2 1 3 2 4 3 2 1 calculation of crop reference evapotranspiration the reference evapotranspiration was estimated using a modified fao penman monteith equation presented by yang et al 2019 eq 1 which incorporated a relationship between atmospheric co2 concentration and surface resistance into the fao penman monteith equation eq 2 detailed derivation of this relationship can be found in yang et al 2019 the feature of this equation is that it accounts for the effects of atmospheric co2 concentration on surface resistance and thereby crop transpiration previous studies fischer et al 2007 konzmann et al 2013 saadi et al 2015 proved that there was large difference of iwr with and without considering the effects of co2 concentration on crop transpiration atmospheric co2 concentration has been increasing in the past decades baker et al 2018 and is expected to increase further therefore it is necessary to add atmospheric co2 concentration for calculating iwr to quantify the difference of iwr with and without consideration of co2 the original fao penman monteith equation was also used to calculate iwr without including co2 which is represented as iwrno hereafter iwr with co2 effects is represented as iwrco2 in the paper 1 e t 0 c o 2 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 u 2 0 34 2 4 10 4 c o 2 300 2 e t 0 n o 0 408 δ r n

evapotranspiration for winter wheat and cotton kc is a coefficient related to crop type and to crop growth stage according to the fao manual four crop growth stages were recommended the initial stage the crop development stage the mid season stage and the late season stage kc values are different in the four stages in the study we use kc values of winter wheat and cotton for each growth stage and the crop calendar provided from the database at the scientific information centre of interstate commission on water coordination in ca sic icwc stulina 2010 conrad et al 2013 table 3 presents the details on the basis of et0 co2 et0 no and kc actual evapotranspiration under non limited irrigation et is calculated by eq 3 3 e t et 0 k c 3 2 3 determination of effective rainfall the effective

125 0 2 p 125 p 250 m m 125 0 1 p p 250 m m where p is the monthly precipitation 3 2 4 calculation of iwr for winter wheat and cotton on the basis of et pe and the irrigation efficiency ie iwr is calculated from eq 5 5 i w r et p e i e ie is the ratio between irrigation water actually utilized by growing crops and water diverted from a source in this study we used the result presented by rost et al 2008 in which ie in central asia was estimated as 0 566 according to the eqs 1 5 iwrco2 and iwrno of cotton and winter wheat from 2006 to 2100 are calculated under the scenarios of rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 for the whole area of the five central asian countries it should be pointed out that the actual distributions of cotton or winter wheat are not considered during the calculation the results are a projection of iwr assuming that either cotton or winter wheat is grown in the whole area 3 3 predicting land use types in 2030 this study took the land use data of esa cci of 2000 and 2015 as baseline and used the ca markov method for predicting the land use cover in 2030 over ca the ca markov method is widely used for predicting land use types sang et al 2011 mas et al 2014 hou et al 2019 yang et al 2019 which includes three major procedures i using the markov method to produce the transition probability matrix the transition areas matrix and a set of conditional probability images over the period between 2000 and 2015 ii using the ca markov method to predict the land use cover in 2030 the inputs include a basis land cover image which is the land use cover in 2015 the transition areas matrix and the conditional probability images produced in procedure i suitability maps constructed from driving factors of land use change and iii at last a 5 5 contiguity filter is used to down weight the suitability of pixels that are distant from existing instances of the land cover type under consideration 3 4 validating ca markov method it is always important to quantify the predictability of the ca markov method in this region since we have three stages 2005 2010 and 2015 of land use types we firstly used cci data of 2005 and 2010 together with the ca markov method described in section 3 3 for predicting the land use types of 2015 we then used kappa index to evaluate its predictability by comparing the predicted and actual land use data in 2015 the kappa index pontius 2000 is defined as 6 k a p p a p 0 p c p p p c where p0 is the proportion of correct simulation pc is the expected proportion of correct simulation in random circumstances and pp is the proportion of correct simulation in ideal circumstances kappa 0 8 indicates high consistency and kappa 0 40 indicates poor consistency yang et al 2019 fu et al 2018 our result of kappa index between the predicted and the actual land cover in 2015 is 0 84 which indicates the ca markov method is sufficient for this study 3 5 the mann kendall method the mann kendall test is used for testing the trend of iwr which is an excellent tool for trend detection burn and elnur 2002 two parameters of the slope β and the significance indicate the direction as well as the magnitude of the trend in the study positive values of β represent an increasing trend conversely negative values represent a decreasing trend the significance of the trend was evaluated at 0 05 level 4 results 4 1 the effects of the increasing atmospheric co2 concentration on iwr atmospheric co2 concentration has effects on iwr by reducing stomatal opening and thereby reducing crop transpiration yang et al 2019 this section gives the comparisons between iwrco2 and iwrno by which the reduction of iwr due to the increasing co2 concentration in the future is illustrated firstly we compare the changing trends of iwrco2 and iwrno from 2006 to 2100 which are obtained using the mann kendall method fig 2 displays the areas with significant iwrco2 and iwrno trends at 0 05 level for cotton and winter wheat under rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 respectively it is obvious that the trend of iwrco2 is completely different with iwrno under rcp2 6 significant decline trend in the northeast of ca and no significant change in the other areas were found for iwrco2 of cotton and winter wheat however iwrno has no obvious changes in the northeast of ca and has significant increases in the other areas under rcp4 5 iwrco2 and iwrno both have increasing trends for the two crops their difference is that the magnitude of the increasing trend of iwrco2 is 0 5 less than iwrno for illustrating the difference of the future variations between iwrco2 and iwrno further the relative changes of iwrco2 and iwrno in the four periods 2020s 2021 2040 2040s 2041 2060 2060s 2061 2080 2080s 2081 2100 compared to current condition i e 2006s 2006 2020 were computed respectively furthermore fig 3 summarizes the differences between the relative changes of iwrco2 and that of iwrno which can quantitatively indicate the effects of co2 fertilization on the magnitude of future variations of iwr fig 3 shows that the relative changes of iwrno are 0 5 larger than that of iwrco2 for cotton over the whole ca for winter wheat the differences between the relative changes of iwrco2 and that of iwrno are also less than 5 in most areas of ca however the areas in east ca mostly in kgz and in east kaz exhibit a difference of 5 10 and the southeast ca mostly in tjk exhibit a difference of more than 50 these indicate that co2 fertilization would reduce the relative changes of iwr of less than 5 in most areas of ca in tjk the reduction due to co2 fertilization is the largest the above results are based on the iwr across the whole ca to focus on the iwr in the cropland and to evaluate the co2 fertilization impacts on the total amount of irrigation water for each of the five countries fig 4 summarizes the change differences of the medians of iwrco2 and iwrno in the cropland between 2015 and 2030 for the five countries under rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 and fig 5 summarizes the change differences of the total amount of irrigation water between 2015 and 2030 total amount of irrigation water is calculated by multiplying the medians of iwrco2 iwrno with the cropland areas the cropland areas in 2030 were projected with the ca markov method see section 3 3 it is clear from fig 4 that there are very different changes between iwrco2 and iwrno in some cases there even exist opposite change signs for example the opposite sign for cotton in kaz under rcp2 6 the opposite sign for winter wheat in tjk under rcp2 6 and in kaz and tkm under rcp4 5 despite of large spatial difference there is no large difference between the total amount of irrigation water considering co2 fertilization and that without considering co2 fertilization see fig 5 this indicates the spatial difference is cancelled when aggregated to the total difference based on the above analysis it is clear that compared to iwrco2 without including co2 fertilization for estimating iwr results in very different change results in some regions and could lead to wrong conclusions in some cases the sign change can also be different therefore it is necessary using iwrco2 for appropriate evaluations of climate change impact on iwr in sections of 4 2 4 5 we use iwrco2 for our analysis to introduce the spatial and temporal changes of iwr over ca 4 2 the trend of iwrco2 of cotton and winter wheat in the future fig 2 in section 4 1 displays the area with significant iwrco2 trends at 0 05 level for cotton and winter wheat under rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 respectively it is clear that iwrco2 for the two crops has significantly increased in the most area under rcp4 5 the values in most areas of uzb and tkm are 0 5 1 0 the increasing trend in tjk is the largest with the slope values of 1 0 1 5 the increasing magnitude of cotton is larger than that of winter wheat over kaz it is also seen that the increasing trend becomes larger from the north to the south under rcp4 5 under rcp2 6 significant decrease trend in iwrco2 is identified in the northeastern kaz there are no obvious changes of iwrco2 in uzb tkm tjk and kgz the above results illustrate that iwrco2 for cotton and winter wheat would decrease over ca under rcp2 6 and increase under rcp4 5 the largest increase under rcp4 5 occurs in tjk 4 3 the relative changes of iwrco2 of cotton and winter wheat in the future for illustrating the future variations of iwrco2 of cotton and winter wheat clearly the medians of iwrco2 in the four periods 2020s 2040s 2060s 2080s are compared with that of current condition i e 2006s fig 6 and fig 7 summarize the relative iwrco2 changes for cotton and winter wheat respectively it can be seen from fig 6 that iwrco2 of cotton under rcp2 6 increases at first and then decreases comparing with that in 2006s in 2020s and 2040s iwrco2 of cotton increases by less than 5 over the whole ca in 2060s and 2080s most areas exhibit a decrease of 0 5 this is related to the peak and decline pattern of radiative forcing in rcp2 6 which first reaches radiative forcing at around 3 1 w m 2 by 2050 and returns to 2 6 w m 2 by 2100 comparatively the increase in iwrco2 is more obvious under rcp4 5 with iwrco2 increasing by 5 in all the four periods the areas in the southeast exhibit the large increase of 5 15 in 2060s and 2080s where tjk and kgz are located fig 7 shows that iwrco2 trend for winter wheat is similar to that for cotton under rcp2 6 with increases at first and then decreases in 2060s and 2080s the increases in 2020s and 2040s are less than 5 in most areas in 2060s and 2080s the north areas have decreases of 5 the southeastern mountain areas exhibit the largest increase with more than 50 increase in some areas this is different from the cotton pattern for which there does not exist large change in the southeastern areas different from the pattern under rcp2 6 iwrco2 for winter wheat is decreased in some eastern areas in 2020s and 2040s under rcp4 5 while these areas show 5 increases in 2060s and 2080s the largest increase occurs in the southern ca including western tjk eastern uzb and southern tkm the highest increase of 50 occurs in the western tjk the above results indicate that under rcp2 6 iwrco2 of both cotton and winter wheat shows increasing patterns in 2020s and 2040s and decreasing patterns in 2060s and 2080s the southeastern mountain region of ca has the largest increases of iwrco2 for the two crops under the two climate scenarios the increase of iwrco2 under rcp4 5 is more significant than that under rcp2 6 in comparison with cotton winter wheat exhibits larger changes of iwrco2 in the southeastern mountain areas iwrco2 in tjk is more sensitive to the climate change 4 4 iwrco2 of the five central asian countries in the future fig 8 shows iwrco2 of uzb and kaz in the five periods uzb and kaz constitute high proportions of the total agricultural land in ca compared to the other three the medians of iwrco2 of cotton and winter wheat during the periods of 2006s and 2080s for the five countries under rcp 2 6 and rcp 4 5 were summarized in supplementary table 3 it can be seen from fig 8 that iwrco2 of winter wheat is lower than that of cotton because precipitation in ca usually occurs during the winter mainly between october and april during winter wheat growing seasons the water requirement for irrigation is low in addition fig 8 shows that the absolute differences of iwrco2 for cotton or winter wheat between the five periods are not significant for both rcp 2 6 and rcp 4 5 which corresponds to the results shown in section 4 2 that the relative changes of iwrco2 are less than 5 in most areas of ca fig 8 also shows that both crops have the increasing pattern initially in 2020s and 2040s and then the decreasing pattern in 2060s and 2080s under rcp2 6 in summary among the five countries tkm has the largest iwrco2 for cotton or winter wheat followed by uzb and then kaz tjk and kgz located in the mountainous areas have low iwrco2 mainly driven by the high precipitation there it should be pointed out that iwrco2 of winter wheat not shown in the paper is negative in some areas in kgz and tjk where mean precipitation can meet the irrigation requirements 4 5 the predictions of the land use cover in 2030 and the corresponding changes of iwrco2 this section shows the effects of land use change and focuses on iwrco2 in the cropland the transition probabilities of land use cover from 2015 to 2030 see supplementary table 2 show that the transitions from irrigated cropland to other land use types account for 28 4 18 8 of which are changed as urban areas respectively some other land types transferred to irrigated cropland as a whole the irrigated cropland is 254 161 km2 in 2015 and is projected to increase to 256 466 km2 in 2030 over ca there is an increase of 2305 km2 approximately 0 9 of baseline irrigated land area for clarifying the changes of iwrco2 due to the change of cropland and its effects on the total amount of irrigation water table 4 lists the areas of the irrigated cropland the medians of iwrco2 the total amount of water for irrigation in 2015 and in 2030 respectively for the five counties table 4 shows that except tkm the other four counties all have some decreases of the areas of the irrigated cropland from 2015 to 2030 conversely tkm has a large increase of 30 5 from 40 233 km2 in 2015 to 52 516 km2 in 2030 kaz has the largest area of the irrigated cropland the next is uzb followed by tkm kgz and tjk the comparisons of the medians of iwrco2 for cotton or for winter wheat between the five countries show that tkm has the maximum iwrco2 the next is uzb followed by kaz and tjk and kgz has the minimum iwrco2 the total amount of water for irrigation is estimated using the areas of the irrigated cropland and the median iwrco2 because kaz and uzb have much larger irrigated cropland than the other three countries and tkm has the largest iwrco2 large amount of irrigation water are required in kaz uzb and tkm tjk has the minimum coverage of the irrigated cropland and requires the minimum amount of water for irrigation we further analyze if water supply can meet water use in ca in terms of the aquastat data of fao http www fao org nr water aquastat water use index stm total renewable freshwater supply for kaz kgz tjk tkm and uzb in 2011 are 107 5 km3 23 6 km3 21 9 km3 24 8 km3 and 48 9 km3 respectively compared with the total irrigation water of cotton it is clear that water supply is far less than the total irrigation water for cotton in kaz kgz tkm and uzb especially in tkm and uzb this means that if the irrigated cropland is primarily cultivated with cotton the gap between the water supply and the water use would be very large and the water scarcity in ca would get worse in comparison the water supply is obviously higher than iwrco2 for kaz kgz and tjk if the cropland in the three countries is primarily cultivated with winter wheat suggesting water supply in the three countries can meet iwrco2 for winter wheat however for tkm and uzb the gap between the water supply and iwrco2 for winter wheat is still very large although it is less than the gap of cotton the total amount of irrigation water between 2015 and 2030 shows large increases for tkm about 28 km3 for cotton and 17 km3 for winter wheat 33 increase compared to 2015 due to the significant increase of cropland the other four countries have small differences about 1 10 km3 less than 10 compared to 2015 between 2015 and 2030 therefore cropland use change has large effects on the total irrigation water use in tkm 5 discussion the large increase of atmospheric co2 concentration in recent decades has been an apparent indication of climate change by changing atmospheric radiative forcing reducing plant transpiration stimulating photosynthesis and improving water use efficiency atmospheric co2 concentration has led to dramatic influences on surface radiation budget water balance crop yield crop irrigation requirement and ecosystem carbon cycle etc it involves all kinds of the aspects of social and natural system the impacts of atmospheric co2 concentration on iwr mainly reflect in its effects on vegetation transpiration by two pathways the first is direct in which a higher co2 concentration drives partial stomatal closure and consequently indirectly increases surface resistance the second is indirect in which the climate response to elevated co2 concentration leads to a higher atmospheric vapor pressure deficit that also reduces the stomatal opening yang et al 2019 if the elevated co2 concentration in the future is not considered in the projection of et0 et0 would be obviously overestimated which could cause some inadequate and even wrong conclusions for example some studies cook et al 2014 feng and fu 2013 have concluded a substantial drying trend over global terrestrial environments towards the end of the twenty first century in terms of the classic aridity index the ratio of precipitation to et0 however this has been proved to be inadequate because of the overestimation of et0 without considering the effect of elevated co2 concentration roderick et al 2015 swann et al 2016 this study further corroborates the overestimated et0 in ca causing the overestimation of iwr presently there are only few studies about the global future iwr that consider the effects of co2 fertilization on iwr over ca however because of the different climate scenarios different methods different crop types and different baseline periods used their results are somewhat inconsistent with the results presented in this study for instance the study by wada et al 2013 shows that the ensemble mean of iwr estimated from seven global hydrological models driven by climate forcing from five global climate models to estimate iwr has an increasing trend in the irrigated cropland in ca in 2080s 2069 2099 compared to the 2000s 1980 2010 under rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 however our results show there exist decreases in 2080s in some areas of ca especially under rcp2 6 figs 6 and 7 in wada et al 2013 a distinct decreasing trend of iwr is projected by lpjml model which is the only model considering co2 fertilization effects on crop photosynthesis and transpiration while the other six models project a consistent increase of iwr resulting in the increasing trend in the ensemble mean of iwr the different performances between lpjml and the other six also illustrate that with and without considering co2 fertilization effects in the estimation of iwr would result in opposite conclusions it is noted that this study uses an extreme assumption that either cotton or winter wheat is grown in the whole region this is because we cannot exactly predict where cotton or winter wheat is planted in the next several decades this extreme assumption may help to understand the iwr variation over the whole ca furthermore this paper has following limitations first the potential changes of the crop growing periods due to climate change are not taken into account in calculating iwr second fertilizer impacts on iwr are not considered as well these factors may cause some uncertainties in our iwr calculations 6 conclusions in the five central asian countries irrigation accounts for most of their water withdrawal 66 for kaz 93 for kgz 91 for tjk 94 3 for tkm and 90 for uzb according to fao therefore it is important to study the irrigation water requirement in the future this study investigates the iwr changes for cotton and winter wheat under climate change scenarios including co2 fertilization and land use change over ca it is clear that with and without considering co2 concentration for estimating iwr can result in large difference co2 fertilization would reduce the relative changes of iwr of less than 5 in most areas of ca in tjk the reduction due to co2 fertilization is the largest in the future iwr of cotton and winter wheat have increasing patterns in 2020s and 2040s and decreasing in 2060s and 2080s under rcp2 6 the magnitude change is less than 5 under rcp4 5 most areas in ca exhibit an increase of less than 5 the maximum increases of 5 15 for cotton occur in tjk the maximum increase of more than 50 for winter wheat occurs in tjk under both climate scenarios the results of the land use change on iwr indicate that iwr in tkm is most sensitive to land use change with 33 increase compared with iwr in 2015 the other four countries have small differences less than 10 between 2015 and 2030 water security pressure is predicted severe in tkm and uzb and the smallest in tjk declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

5768,this study investigated the characteristics of wintertime precipitation in eastern china and associated atmospheric circulation based on different madden julian oscillation mjo activities besides the underlying causes and impacts of mjo activities on wintertime precipitation in eastern china were explored as well by analyzing large scale atmospheric circulations conditions the results indicated that 1 in different mjo phases distinct differences can be observed in spatial patterns of wintertime precipitation in eastern china especially in southeastern china 2 significant enhanced precipitation can be detected over southeastern china during active mjo events while precipitation reduced significantly over these regions during inactive mjo events enhancement of precipitation during active mjo events was mainly attributed to the increased precipitation on phases 2 4 3 the impacts of mjo phases on precipitation can be explained by the northeastward propagation of atmospheric pressure pattern over eastern china during active mjo events this study may provide theoretical knowledge for water resources management and early warning of floods and droughts in eastern china the potential teleconnections of near equatorial mjo activities to the subtropics or extratropics precipitation over eastern china were also discussed in this study keywords wintertime precipitation tropical low frequency variability mjo water vapor flux propagation spatiotemporal precipitation pattern east asia monsoon 1 introduction the madden julian oscillation mjo an eastward propagating oscillation one of the dominant modes of tropical variability at intra seasonal time scales madden and julian 1971 1994 is a natural phenomenon of the coupled ocean atmosphere system zhang et al 2009 the mjo has remarkable impacts on atmospheric circulation across the global tropics madden and julian 1994 zhang and oscillation 2005 specifically it has impacts on rainfall distribution over southeast china via its convectively active phases jones et al 2004 xavier et al 2014 lim et al 2017 numerous studies have been investigated on the impacts of mjo on precipitation changes at different spatial and temporal scales zhang et al 2009 wang et al 2017 pai et al 2011 showed that intra seasonal variations of daily rainfall distribution over india are closely related with various phases of eastward propagating mjo life cycle these results indicated that the impacts of mjo involved with larger scale such as pacific rather than limited to the india region chi et al 2015 pointed out that the establishment of east asian subtropical summer monsoon 20 30 n and 110 120 e and south asian high are associated with wet phase of mjo lin et al 2010 indicated that the precipitation variability in canada is correlated with the dipole tropical convection anomaly in the indian ocean and western pacific therefore impacts of the mjo on precipitation variability are related to large spatial scale including regions like canada lin et al 2010 brazil barreto et al 2017 india pai et al 2011 southeast asia lim et al 2017 and especially east asia he et al 2011 park et al 2018 or china liu and yang 2010 jia et al 2011 eastern china is climatically characterized by monsoon climate fig 1 relief data is sourced from national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa https www ngdc

largest monsoon regions in the world china has the largest population and 70 of them live in eastern china e g zhu et al 2011 zhang et al 2017 rapidly socioeconomic development in eastern china typically metropolis such as beijing shanghai and guangzhou take unshakable positions in china thus society and socio economy of eastern china are highly sensitive to precipitation changes e g zhu et al 2011 zhang et al 2017 in this sense it is of paramount importance in water resources management and precipitation variations monitoring in eastern china previous studies have been done on precipitation regimes and underlying causes li et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 2015 2016 2017 lin and wang 2016 moreover heavy precipitation variations and monsoon activities are raising human concerns nowadays e g meng and wang 2016 luo et al 2016 luo and lin 2017 zhang et al 2017 winter precipitation is rather limited when compared with summer precipitation nonetheless winter precipitation shows large interannual variations in many regions great losses in agriculture are caused due to cold surges or snowstorms occurs in wintertime wintertime precipitation regimes has raised human s attention in recent years previous studies zhou and wu 2010 ma et al 2018 suggested that el nino has impacts on wintertime precipitation in southeastern china weak east asian winter monsoon eawm or warm enso events strengthens southwesterly winds over the foreland of southeast china and enhances precipitation in southern and eastern china warmer sea surface temperature sst in eastern south indian ocean and cooler sst in western south indian ocean enhance precipitation in southern china and the anomalous vertical circulations including two branches ascending branch of the western north pacific and descending branch of the south indian ocean and southern china are associated with southern china rainfall and eastern south indian ocean sst anomalies chen et al 2014 jia and ge 2017 investigated interdecadal changes of the relationship between winter precipitation anomalies in southeastern china and enso or eawm at the end of the twentieth century and it suggested that the relationships between the interannual variability of winter precipitation in southeastern china and enso or eawm are weakened after 1998 99 besides huang et al 2017 indicated that the strengthening of siberian high enhanced the eawm and weakened southwesterly winds over the south china sea which further reduce the precipitation in southern china in contrast to summertime mjo in wintertime is more active and shows notable effects on wintertime precipitation regimes at different time scales previous researches have investigated the precipitation changes in east asia during boreal winter at intraseasonal scale e g yao et al 2015 yao et al 2015 explained the leading eof modes of wintertime precipitation by phases 3 and 5 of the mjo and it indicated that the variance of intraseasonal precipitation in china is influenced by the variance of tropical convection and the cold surge in winter hung et al 2014 suggested that precipitation in taiwan increased in phases 3 and 4 of the mjo and reduced in phases 7 and 8 jeong et al 2008 found that the precipitation variation over east asia reaches 3 4 mm day between wet and dry periods when the locations of mjo convection centers shifted over the indian ocean and western pacific in addition lim et al 2017 indicated that the rainfall pattern of southeast asia was mainly dominated by cold surges css and mjo increases the convection and enhances precipitation compared to css solely however most of the researches on mjo mainly focus on the impacts of mjo phases on precipitation and few detailed researches are available to address the impacts of the strengths or intensity of mjo activities on wintertime precipitation over eastern china in addition mechanism of the mjo influence on wintertime precipitation is still unclear this study emphasizes the response of precipitation to the strength of mjo and weather there were significant differences of precipitation while the strength of mjo activities are extremely high low moreover this study further investigated the moisture transport conditions and the associated teleconnections of the mjo and try to explain the precipitation pattern under different mjo events herein we aim to explore the issues as followings a how mjo activities influence wintertime precipitation regimes over eastern china and what is the underlying physical process and mechanisms b what are spatiotemporal properties of wintertime precipitation over eastern china during different phases and strengths of mjo activities to answer above mentioned scientific issues will be of great importance to the understand changes of wintertime precipitation regimes in both space and time and also for water resources and agricultural management in eastern china the aims of this study are to 1 investigate the properties of mjo events and different mjo phases 2 identify the impacts of the strengths and phases of mjo activities on wintertime precipitation regimes in eastern china and 3 bring insight into the underlying mechanisms of the mjo impacts the rest part of this paper is organized as followings section 2 described the datasets and methodologies including the diagnosis of mjo events and the classification of active inactive mjo events section 3 presented the main results of the study including the main mjo features properties of mjo phases the role of enso on mjo associated precipitation and wintertime precipitation changes in eastern china under impacts of extremely strong weak mjo events and mjo phases section 4 summarized and discussed the study 2 data and methodology 2 1 daily precipitation data daily precipitation data from 731 meteorological stations in 1979 2013 were collected from national climate center ncc of china meteorological administration cma at http www nmic cn web channel 368 htm locations of meteorological stations can be found in fig 1 2 2 reanalysis data the reanalysis datasets are products combining multi source data such as in situ observation data satellite data and numerical simulation or forecast data based on the atmospheric data assimilation technology reanalysis originated in the exploitation of meteorological data reanalysis data provide multivariate meteorological observations a wide spatial and temporal coverage and coherent record of the global atmospheric circulation and it shows great value for atmospheric research such as the characteristics of precipitation and temperature or even the causes of climate changes and the extreme events reanalysis data in this research involves latitudinal wind speed at 850 hpa u850 latitudinal wind speed at 200 hpa u200 longitudinal wind speed at 850 hpa v850 geopotential hgt at 500 hpa and specific humidity shum at 850 hpa with spatial resolution of 2 5 2 5 daily and monthly

html 2 4 band pass filter bpf to better analyze the intra seasonal characteristics of mjo events the raw data were used to calculate mjo index by processing band pass lanczos filtering to retain the 20 100 days variations duchon 1979 barreto et al 2013 in this study the band pass lanczos filter waliser et al 2009 was used to construct the intra seasonal 20 100 days band pass filtered anomalies comparing to the unfiltered data the leading eofs of 20 100 day band pass filtered anomalies have been proved to represent distinct intra seasonal characteristics of mjo waliser et al 2009 therefore although a real time rmm index is provided by bureau of meteorology australia it is beneficial to calculate the band pass filtered anomalies to better study the intra seasonal characteristics of mjo which has been widely used in previous mjo researches barreto et al 2017 kim et al 2009 in this study mjo index was calculated by using the daily olr u850 and u200 anomalies data based on the band pass filtering with the band width of 20 100 days unfiltered daily anomalies in this study are computed by subtracting the climatological daily means calculated using all years of the daily data as suggested by waliser et al 2009 2 5 empirical orthogonal function eof the empirical orthogonal function eof analysis tends to identify physical and dynamically independent patterns or normal modes montroy 1997 kim and wu 1999 kim 2017 in this study mjo index was derived based on eof analysis 2 6 water vapor flux and water vapor flux divergence water vapor flux or moisture flux indicate the magnitude and direction of the transportation of water vapor in the atmosphere it is a measurement of the intensity and direction of water vapor transport which is given by the water vapor flow running through an air parcel during a unit time interval the water vapor flux equation at a certain air pressure level e g 850 hpa is q v q g where q refers to water vapor flux v is the wind velocity q the relative humidity and g is the acceleration due to gravity water vapor flux divergence convergence indicates moisture budget for an air parcel during a unit time interval water vapor flux divergence convergence at a certain air pressure level it is given by f q u x q v y where f denotes water vapor flux divergence and qu qv is zonal meridional water vapor flux 2 7 identification of mjo index wheeler and hendon 2004 developed a diagnosis for identification of mjo events using the multivariate eof analysis based on the equatorial average of olr u850 and u200 in this study an mjo is defined by the empirical orthogonal functions eofs of the near equatorial 15 s 15 n averaged daily zonal wind at 850 and 200 hpa and olr data applying band pass filtering as suggested by waliser et al 2009 the first two normalized principal component pc time series called rmm1 and rmm2 were defined as the index of mjo real time rmms data are available at the bureau of meteorology of australia http www bom gov au climate mjo it shall be noted that in this study the rmm data was calculated again based on the u850 u200 and olr filtered data it can be better to present the characteristics of intraseasonal period 20 100 days 2 8 identification of active inactive mjo events mjo index in this study was defined as rmm 1 2 r m m 2 2 daily rmm index 1 was defined as active mjo day and mjo index 1 was defined as inactive mjo day and wintertime in this study refers to winter half year of north hemisphere waliser et al 2009 i e november to april of the next year therefore study period in this study includes the wintertime from 1979 to 2012 from november of 1979 to april of 2013 therefore strength of mjo activities can be quantified based on rmm index in this study strength of each mjo event was computed by 91 day moving window centered at each day of the wintertime from 1979 to 2012 to better quantify impacts of mjo events on wintertime precipitation in eastern china two types of mjo events were defined the series of 91 day running mean rmm index from 1979 to 2012 were standardized and the extreme mjo events were selected as the two types of mjo events i e active inactive mjo events based on the standardized rmm series 2 9 precipitation anomalies and test of significance long term daily means daily climatology of precipitation were calculated from daily data and daily precipitation anomalies were calculated by subtracting the daily climatology annual cycle from the raw daily data the diagnosis of statistical significance in this study is based on student s t test two sided precipitation anomalies were analyzed based on the comparations between the precipitation of extreme mjo events and long term daily means daily climatology precipitation the statistical significance of precipitation anomalies during different types of mjo events were estimated by the test statistic t of t test it is calculated as t x 1 x 2 n 1 1 s 1 2 n 2 1 s 2 2 n 1 n 2 2 1 n 1 1 n 2 where x 1 x 2 are the mean of two samples s 1 2 s 2 2 are the sample standard deviation and n 1 n 2 are the sample size if the observed t statistic exceeds the critical value determined by the appropriate reference distribution the null hypothesis i e h0 two samples has no significant difference is rejected the critical value depends on the significance level of the test the probability of erroneously rejecting the null hypothesis values of 0 10 or less 0 05 in this research are commonly used as the critical levels of significance α 0 05 indicating the precipitation is significantly difference from long term mean precipitation with 95 percent confidence the confidence level is 1 α 3 results 3 1 the main mjo features and mjo phases properties fig 2 shows long term mean shaded in fig 2 and root mean square deviation rmsd contour in fig 2 of olr u850 and u200 fig 2a showed a strong convection in indonesia islands maritime continent 90 e 150 e 15 s 15 n indicated larger water vapor content and high cloud coverage in these regions however weak convection can be observed in tropical regions in the eastern pacific 120 w 170 w 15 s 15 e indicating no evident atmospheric convection activities and lower cloud coverage in these regions fig 2a besides spatial pattern of u850 indicates that the indonesia islands showed as tropical convergence regions fig 2b and the divergence center can also be observed over indonesia islands at 200 hpa pressure level suggesting that the indonesia islands or the maritime continent was the tropical convention center therefore u850 u200 and olr can combine to reflect tropical atmospheric activities and energy distribution in north hemisphere during winter season based on previous researches e g waliser et al 2009 rmm1 and rmm2 can be used for the classification of the eight mjo phases indicating the eastward propagation of tropical convention center different phases decide the position of tropical convection center of mjo activities for instance phases 2 and 3 indicated the tropical convection activities mainly concentrated at indian ocean while phases 6 and 7 indicated the tropical convention center located at the western pacific eight mjo phases were analyzed respectively based on dates with mjo index larger than 1 and then observed precipitation changes and associated water vapor propagation in east asia of different mjo phases were investigated fig 3 and fig 4 analyzed the variance of precipitation and associated anomalies of water vapor transport influenced by mjo phases fig 3 demonstrates spatial distribution of in situ observed precipitation anomalies of the eight mjo phases across china fig 4 are associated water vapor transport conditions of the eight mjo phases respectively distinct differences of precipitation anomalies can be observed among different mjo phases fig 3 in phase 2 fig 3b enhanced precipitation can be observed in some regions of eastern china at around 30 n then in phase 3 fig 3c the rainfall belt propagated southward and evident enhancement of precipitation can be detected in foreland of southeastern china thereafter in phases 4 5 coastal regions of southeastern china were still dominated by enhanced precipitation however it can be detected that area with enhanced precipitation became narrowed and decrease of precipitation can be observed at around 30 n difference between southern china and northern china can be observed in phase 5 fig 3e and increasing precipitation anomalies can be observed in coastal regions of southeastern china while reduced precipitation can be detected in northern china in phases 6 and 7 of mjo fig 3f 3 g reduced precipitation can be observed in most of the eastern china especially in southeastern china fig 4 shows 850 hpa moisture transport conditions of 8 mjo phases water vapor flux measures intensity of moisture transport and water vapor divergence indicates water vapor budget lower tropospheric has the greatest impact on precipitation and 850 hpa wind and moisture transport has been widely used to investigate the precipitation patterns e g pai et al 2011 zhang et al 2017 fig 4 illustrates the water vapor transport anomalies of different mjo phases wherein evident anomalies of water vapor flux can be detected in mjo phases 2 3 6 and 7 in phases 2 and 3 p2 and p3 in fig 4 water vapor flux anomalies from indian ocean western pacific and south china sea propagates northwards and reaches eastern china it may imply that vapor transport from western pacific to eastern china enhanced during phases 2 and 3 and it was benefit to the occurrence of precipitation adverse conditions can be observed in phases 6 and 7 p6 and p7 in fig 4 and water vapor flux propagates southwards therefore in phases 6 and 7 northward water vapor transport from south china sea and indian ocean become weaker so less moisture can reach eastern china therefore under these mjo phases the moisture transport conditions were unfavorable to the occurrence of precipitation in eastern china water vapor convergence anomalies can be found over foreland of southeastern china in phases 2 and 3 while water vapor divergence anomalies can be found over these regions during phases 6 and 7 which is corresponding to the anomalies of water vapor flux during these phases the moisture transport conditions can well explain the precipitation anomalies of different mjo phases in phases 2 3 water vapor flux from indian ocean south china sea and western pacific provided sufficient moisture for the occurrence of precipitation in eastern china on the contrast in phases 6 7 southward water vapor propagation was unfavorable to the occurrence of precipitation furthermore it was found that precipitation in eastern china had close relationship with water vapor transport over east asia and western pacific meanwhile water vapor transport can be used to explain the transitions between mjo phases and relevant precipitation variations from phases 2 3 to phases 6 7 eastern china showed enhanced southward moisture transport and weakened northward moisture transport from south china sea simultaneously the rainfall belt in eastern china propagated southward from phases 2 3 to phases 6 7 mjo activities strongly affected the spatial temporal features of moisture transport and precipitation in eastern china previous studies tang and yu 2008 peng et al 2011 peng et al 2019 shimizu et al 2017 have shown that enso is closely correlated to the mjo events to further analyze the interactions of enso and mjo on precipitation this study analyzed the precipitation changes during the mjo lifecycle on different enso phases in fig 3 mjo has remarkable impacts on southeastern china green rectangle area in fig 3 and fig 5 shows precipitation anomalies of different mjo phases over this area during warm cold enso periods it shows that enso has great impacts on precipitation and winter precipitation shows great differences between warm and cold enso events over south china during warm enso periods the precipitation enhanced in all phases of mjo over south china while precipitation varied from different mjo phases during cold enso periods precipitation was increased in phases 3 4 while it was decreased in phases 6 8 it is consistent with previous studies karori et al 2013 that el niño warm enso periods will increase the precipitation over southeastern china whereas there are no significant reduction of precipitation during la niña cold enso periods although enso activities may have great impacts on precipitation the variations of precipitation during the lifecycle of mjo show many common features between warm and cold enso periods in both warm and cold enso periods the precipitation changed similarly during mjo lifecycle specifically precipitation was enhanced in phases 2 5 and weakened in phases 6 8 this suggests that different enso events may affect the magnitude of winter precipitation over southeastern china but it will not change the trend of winter precipitation during mjo lifecycle in addition interactions of mjo and nao ao were investigated by some previous studies zhou and miller 2005 lin et al 2007 lin et al 2009 these studies indicated that the mjo would greatly affect the extratropical circulations by the rossby wave in the pacific sector however influence of nao on tropical circulations was mainly detected over tropical atlantic africa lin et al 2007 2009 but not in the pacific sector zhou and miller 2005 also suggested that the influence of ao on tropical circulations is not as evident as the mjo influence on tropical circulations therefore we think the precipitation changes among different mjo phases were mainly caused by the transitions of mjo activities but not the enso nao and the response of precipitation to the changes of mjo activities should be further investigated since it has some characteristics which were not caused by enso nao events fig 6 illustrates the rmm1 rmm2 index 2d phase space as the determination of mjo events mjo indices inside the solid circle indicate inactive mjo i e smaller than 1 rmm index and mjo indices outside the solid circle indicate active mjo fig 6a indicates phase space diagram for active mjo events light blue curves indicate rmm1 rmm2 changes during extreme mjo events i e active mjo events at 2004 1984 1997 1989 2012 and 1988 inactive mjo events at 1983 1980 2000 2010 1995 and 1990 while colorful curves indicate a typical mjo event active mjo events at 2004 and inactive mjo events at 1983 and different colors denote different months fig 6b is similar to fig 6a but refers to inactive mjo events it can be observed from fig 6 that strength and phases of mjo in different years are subject to distinct difference the mjo index or the rmms are mainly at a high level more than 1 during active mjo events and it is easy to find some days which exceed 2 while the rmms mainly around or less than 1 during inactive mjo events meanwhile it can be detected for phase changes of mjo events that during active mjo events from phase 1 to phase 8 the rmm index showed shifts in anticlockwise direction the time scale for an entire period is 30 60 days which is corresponding to a mjo life cycle however it is difficult to see shifts in anticlockwise direction during inactive mjo events suggesting that the position tropical convention center did not move eastward as active mjo did 3 2 wintertime precipitation under impacts of active inactive mjo events fig 7 illustrates the precipitation anomalies during active inactive mjo events during active mjo events fig 7a the precipitation in eastern china is mainly increased especially increase significantly in the foreland of southeastern china during inactive mjo events fig 7b the precipitation in eastern china reduce dominantly typically the precipitation of northeastern china inland regions of central china and the foreland of southeastern china has reduced significantly in particular precipitation reduction is most pronounced in southeastern china which implies a higher risk of drought in these regions during inactive mjo events to better understand the precipitation variations during active inactive mjo events this study analyzed the precipitation anomalies in active inactive events based on eight mjo phases fig 8 shows spatial distribution of the precipitation anomalies over eastern china during active mjo event from fig 8 the precipitation anomalies over eastern china show significant differences among eight mjo phases the precipitation in southeastern china area in green rectangle 21 n 28 n 110 e 120 e was mainly increased in phases 2 4 especially in phase 3 from phase 6 the southeastern china began to show decreased precipitation therefore the increased precipitation anomalies in southeastern china during active mjo events in fig 7a is mainly caused by the increase of precipitation in the mjo phases 2 5 it can also be seen from fig 7 that dipole features can be detected in some phases e g phases 3 5 between southern china and north china that demarcated by the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river at around 30 n abnormal increase of precipitation was found in southeastern china south of 30 n while reduced precipitation was observed over northern china and the jiang huai regions area in purple rectangle 29 n 35 n 113 e 123 e in phases 4 5 on the other hand precipitation was decreased in southeastern china while it was increased in north china from phase 7 therefore precipitation in different regions shows an evident change between different phases in the mjo event cycle the significant increase in precipitation in southeastern china under active mjo events was mainly attributed to the abnormal increase of precipitation in phases 2 5 fig 9 shows the spatial distribution of the precipitation anomalies over eastern china during inactive mjo event from fig 9 that there is a significant difference between the precipitation anomalies in inactive mjo events and that in active mjo events although the jiang huai regions area in purple rectangle showed significant enhanced precipitation in phase 2 most of the other phases showed an abnormal decrease in precipitation especially in phase 8 most regions in southeastern china showed significant precipitation reduction compared with mjo active events the precipitation reduced in most phases during inactive mjo events especially in phases 3 5 the precipitation in southeastern china increased significantly during the active mjo event while increased precipitation can hardly be detected during the inactive mjo events and precipitation decreased in most of the regions during the inactive mjo events eastern china is mainly dominated by decreased precipitation at most mjo phases which may be the main reason for the precipitation reduction during inactive mjo inactive events as shown in fig 7b fig 8 and fig 9 showed that extreme mjo events have great impacts on precipitation over southeastern china in addition jiang huai regions showed distinct precipitation anomalies in several mjo phases during extreme mjo events to analyze the characteristics of precipitation over different regions in eastern china table 1 shows the precipitation anomalies of southeastern china area in green rectangle 21 n 28 n 110 e 120 e and jiang huai regions area in purple rectangle 29 n 35 n 113 e 123 e during two types of extreme mjo events it reveals that during the active mjo events southeastern china showed significant increase in phases 2 4 and significant decrease in phase 6 in the jiang huai regions there is no significant precipitation anomalies in all phases except for phase 4 during inactive mjo events precipitation in phase 1 and phase 6 over jiang huai regions decreased significantly while precipitation in phase 2 increased significantly however only precipitation in phase 8 was significantly reduced over southeastern china compared with no significant anomalies in precipitation during other phases this may imply that active mjo activities have great impacts on the precipitation over southeastern china and when mjo activities is inactive precipitation anomalies are mainly occurred in the jiang huai area and mjo may have less impacts on the precipitation over southeastern china 3 3 moisture transport background under active inactive mjo events we now process to investigate the physical process and mechanism behind the mjo events that impacts on precipitation variations of eastern china including large scale moisture transport the propagation of mjo convention center and geopotential as well as wind field fig 10 shows the moisture transport anomalies under active and inactive mjo events under the active mjo events fig 10a on the east coast of the eurasian continent at around 120 e significant anomalies of moisture transport can be detected from south to north along south china sea and east china sea and there are evident water vapor convergence regions in the foreland of southern china as for the jiang huai regions and the north china region north of yangtze river at around 28 n 30 n these regions are mainly dominated by water vapor divergence it may imply that the enhanced water vapor transport from the south china sea in southern china may led to the enhancement of precipitation over these regions while precipitation may decrease over regions north of the yangtze river for the inactive mjo event fig 10b most of eastern china and the western pacific e g east china sea are characterized by water vapor divergence which may be unfavorable to the occurrence of precipitation over these regions to study the effects of different phases under extreme mjo events fig 11 12 shows the water vapor transport anomalies at different phases of the mjo life cycle under active inactive mjo events it can be detected from fig 11 that the anomalies of water vapor transport between different phases has significant differences and it showed large variance between phases of mjo life cycle at phases 2 3 there are significant enhanced water vapor transport over south china sea the moisture transported northward from south china sea is significantly enhanced accompanying a large amount of water vapors from south china sea being transported to southern china and the foreland of southeastern china also exhibits anomalies of water vapor convergence which may explain the moisture transport conditions for the significant enhancement of precipitation of these phases in fig 8 afterwards the northward water vapor transport from south china sea weakened rapidly and there was no evident water vapor transport anomaly in phase 6 over south china sea and the southeastern china began to be dominated by water vapor divergence which is consistent with the reduced precipitation in southern china in fig 8 therefore the significant enhancement of precipitation in southeastern china under the active mjo events is mainly caused by the increase of precipitation in phases 2 4 the increased water vapor flux from south china sea under these phases transports a large amount of water vapor northward to southeastern china which may provide sufficient water vapor conditions and be beneficial to the significant increase in precipitation in southeastern china fig 12 illustrates the water vapor transport anomalies at the 8 phases of the mjo life cycle under inactive mjo events it can be seen from the figure that it is difficult to observe the distinct change pattern of water vapor transport between phases during inactive mjo events nevertheless some features of water vapor transport can be observed in several phases for instance there is significant water vapor transport anomalies southward over south china sea in phase 8 accompanying anomalies of water vapor divergence over southeastern china indicating that the moisture content in the atmosphere over these regions was reduced which may be unfavorable to the occurrence of precipitation in these regions which is consistent with the significant precipitation reduction in phase 8 fig 8 meanwhile it can be found that except for the phase 2 most of the eastern china are mainly characterized by water vapor divergence which is also consistent with the reduced precipitation as shown in fig 8 3 4 the physical mechanism of mjo activities on wintertime precipitation fig 13 14 illustrated the outgoing longwave radiation olr and wind field anomalies in the tropical regions of the indian ocean and the western pacific 20 s 20 n 50 e 160 w under active inactive mjo events it can be used to study the propagation of the tropical convection center under different mjo events fig 13 shows that from phase 1 to phase 8 the tropical convection center propagated eastward from the indian ocean to the western pacific in phase 1 the tropical convention center was being generated in the indian ocean while the indonesia islands maritime continent were mainly represented as a weak convection zone in phase 2 an obvious convection center had been generated in the indian ocean in phases 3 and 4 the tropical convection center moves eastward gradually indonesia islands maritime continent became the center of the active convection activities in phase 5 while the indian ocean began to appear as an inactive convection zone in phase 6 the tropical convection center continued moving eastward to the western pacific followed by the weak convention area also moving from the indian ocean to the maritime continent in phases 7 and 8 as the weak convection area moved eastward to the maritime continent convection activities become weakened over the maritime continent as can be seen from fig 14 the activities of the convention center during inactive mjo events had large differences compared with that of active mjo events the tropical convection center of the active mjo events showed an obvious propagation from west to east from phase 1 to phase 8 and gradually moved from the african and indian oceans to the mid eastern pacific tropical regions however during the inactive mjo events the tropical convection center hardly propagated or changed the position obviously during the transit of mjo phases the tropical convection center of almost all phases is around the maritime it can also confirm that the rmm index can well reflect the mjo activities and the propagations of tropical convention center to find out the mechanism of mjo activities that impact on precipitation of eastern china fig 15 16 show the large scale 500 hpa geopotential and 850 hpa wind field of different phases under active inactive mjo events it can be seen from fig 15 that at phase 1 the western pacific regions including japan sea of okhotsk were dominated by high pressure while the depression over eastern china was developing and at the following phases 2 3 this atmospheric pressure pattern was more obvious at this time high pressure anomalies appeared over the east side of the eurasian continent and western pacific while depression gradually dominated the southeastern china and the eastern eurasian continent from phases 4 or 5 regions of western pacific still appeared high pressure anomalies but it retreated northeastward to the northern pacific bering sea while the depression over southeastern china strengthened and moved eastward to the eastern coastal china and western pacific and high pressure anomalies began to appear in indian peninsula at phases 6 7 and 8 the depression center propagated eastward gradually from northwestern pacific such as sea of okhotsk kamchatka peninsula to mid or eastern pacific such as bering sea accompanying the high pressure anomalies in the indian ocean region extended northeastward to the eurasian continent resulting in high pressure anomalies appeared over eastern eurasian continent including eastern china east china sea and western pacific it can be inferred that phases 1 8 represents a lifecycle of mjo activities accompanied by the northeastward propagations of the atmospheric pressure pattern from the tropical indian ocean to the high latitude northern pacific and the bering sea in boreal winter eurasian continent is dominated by east asia siberian high while western pacific is relatively appeared depression which make the eastern eurasian continent including the eastern china dominated by northerly winds but at mjo phases 2 and 3 the eastern china appeared negative geopotential anomalies while northwestern pacific appeared positive geopotential anomalies and it means eastern china is dominated by low pressure anomalies while western pacific is dominated by high pressure anomalies therefore it may imply that the pressure gradient decreased and westerly wind weakened over eurasian continent and western pacific and it results in anomalous southerly wind along coastal regions of east asia which is benefit for the moisture transport from south china sea to southeastern china as for phases 6 8 regions of northern and central pacific and aleutian islands were dominated by depression while eastern china is dominated by east asia high resulting in the eastern china mainly dominated by northerly wind which is not benefit to the precipitation of these regions it may explain the mechanism of the anomalies of moisture transport as well the precipitation variations during active mjo events it can be seen from fig 16 that compared with the active mjo events the 500 hpa geopotential and 850 hpa wind field under the inactive mjo events are difficult to find out a life cycle as active mjo events did except for phase 2 the eastern part of the eurasian continent and the western pacific are mainly dominated by anomalous depression while the high pressure occurred at high latitudes regions north of 50 n and converse only in the northwestern pacific such as japan or sea of okhotsk of phase 2 was dominated by anomalous high pressure while the eastern china is dominated by anomalous low pressure at the same phase it can be speculated that the active mjo events and the eastward propagations of the convection center in the tropics as shown in fig 13 and fig 14 may stimulate the periodic changes of the atmospheric pressure pattern fig 15 and fig 16 in eastern china the tropical convection center propagated eastward from the indonesian peninsula to the middle east and the pacific ocean during the mjo lifecycle as an atmospheric rossby wave response the atmospheric pressure pattern along the indian peninsula eastern china and western pacific regions propagated northeastward following the changes of mjo phases and it led to the transition from the depression phases 2 4 to the high pressure phases 6 8 over eastern china which may further affect the moisture transport and precipitation over these regions 4 conclusion and discussions this study attempts to examine the spatiotemporal patterns of wintertime precipitation in different mjo events and causes from viewpoints of water vapor transport some interesting and important conclusions were obtained as follows 1 precipitation over eastern china and associated moisture transport showed evident changes among different mjo phases during mjo phase 2 and 3 plenty of atmospheric moisture from indian ocean western pacific and south china sea transported northward and reaches eastern china resulting in enhanced precipitation over southeastern china while during mjo phases 6 and 7 most regions in southeastern china showed abnormal southward moisture transport and moisture divergence which is unfavorable to the occurrence of precipitation 2 during active mjo events precipitation enhanced significantly in southeastern china and it was mainly attributed to the increased precipitation in phase 2 5 it can be partly explained by the atmospheric moisture transport conditions significant anomalies of atmospheric moisture transport were detected from the south china sea to southeastern china during phase 2 4 which may provide sufficient water vapor for the enhancement of precipitation in southeastern china 3 during inactive mjo events precipitation decreased significantly in southeastern china with most of the mjo phases shows reduced precipitation in these regions and it may lead to a higher risk of drought over southeastern china during wintertime with non active mjo activities in jiang huai regions significant increased precipitation can be detected in phase 2 while significant decreased precipitation occurred in phase 1 and 6 during inactive mjo events however the integration of all phases did not show significant precipitation anomalies over jiang huai regions 4 during active mjo events the tropical convection center showed a distinct propagation from west to east from phase 1 to phase 8 gradually moving from the indian ocean to the central and eastern of tropical pacific as an atmospheric rossby wave response eastward propagation of tropical convention center stimulated a northeastward propagation of atmospheric pressure pattern over east asia which results in the transition from the depression phase 2 4 to the high pressure phase 6 8 over eastern china and it may further affect the atmospheric moisture transport conditions and finally lead to the precipitation anomalies over these regions this study investigated atmospheric circulation and associated spatial patterns of wintertime precipitation in eastern china based different mjo events and mjo phases besides impacts of mjo on wintertime precipitation variations in eastern china and the potential mechanisms were investigated however more interesting scientific issues are necessary to be explored on further ongoing work for instance further investigations on the simulation and forecast of mjo and the evolutions of mjo activities are of great worth to improve the forecast skill of tropical and extratropical precipitation and even the predictivity of global or regional weather and climate patterns to solve these questions regional climate models of forecast systems may be feasible and useful such as the weather research and forecasting wrf model alaka and maloney 2017 and the predictive ocean atmosphere model for australia poama seasonal forecast system marshall et al 2011 2017 moreover more works are also necessary for analysis on teleconnections of mjo to global weather and climate patterns including climate factors like enso or nao or the monsoon activities in east asia it may be explained by some theories of the low frequency wave mode such as the rossby wave train teleconnectivity chen et al 2016 or the equatorial kelvin wave response lin et al 2009 author contributions y zheng q zhang designed the study y zheng conducted the calculations y zheng q zhang wrote

5768,this study investigated the characteristics of wintertime precipitation in eastern china and associated atmospheric circulation based on different madden julian oscillation mjo activities besides the underlying causes and impacts of mjo activities on wintertime precipitation in eastern china were explored as well by analyzing large scale atmospheric circulations conditions the results indicated that 1 in different mjo phases distinct differences can be observed in spatial patterns of wintertime precipitation in eastern china especially in southeastern china 2 significant enhanced precipitation can be detected over southeastern china during active mjo events while precipitation reduced significantly over these regions during inactive mjo events enhancement of precipitation during active mjo events was mainly attributed to the increased precipitation on phases 2 4 3 the impacts of mjo phases on precipitation can be explained by the northeastward propagation of atmospheric pressure pattern over eastern china during active mjo events this study may provide theoretical knowledge for water resources management and early warning of floods and droughts in eastern china the potential teleconnections of near equatorial mjo activities to the subtropics or extratropics precipitation over eastern china were also discussed in this study keywords wintertime

different spatial and temporal scales zhang et al 2009 wang et al 2017 pai et al 2011 showed that intra seasonal variations of daily rainfall distribution over india are closely related with various phases of eastward propagating mjo life cycle these results indicated that the impacts of mjo involved with larger scale such as pacific rather than limited to the india region chi et al 2015 pointed out that the establishment of east asian subtropical summer monsoon 20 30 n and 110 120 e and south asian high are associated with wet phase of mjo lin et al 2010 indicated that the precipitation variability in canada is correlated with the dipole tropical convection anomaly in the indian ocean and western pacific therefore impacts of the mjo on precipitation variability are related to large spatial scale including regions like canada lin et al 2010 brazil barreto et al 2017 india pai et al 2011 southeast asia lim et al 2017 and especially east asia he et al 2011 park et al 2018 or china

typically metropolis such as beijing shanghai and guangzhou take unshakable positions in china thus society and socio economy of eastern china are highly sensitive to precipitation changes e g zhu et al 2011 zhang et al 2017 in this sense it is of paramount importance in water resources management and precipitation variations monitoring in eastern china previous studies have been done on precipitation regimes and underlying causes li et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 2015 2016 2017 lin and wang 2016 moreover heavy precipitation variations and monsoon activities are raising human concerns nowadays e g meng and wang 2016 luo et al 2016 luo and lin 2017 zhang et al 2017 winter precipitation is rather limited when compared with summer precipitation nonetheless winter precipitation shows large interannual variations in many regions great losses in agriculture are caused due to cold surges or snowstorms occurs in wintertime wintertime precipitation regimes has raised human s attention in recent years previous studies zhou and wu 2010 ma et al 2018 suggested that el nino has impacts on wintertime precipitation in southeastern china weak east asian winter monsoon eawm or warm enso events strengthens southwesterly winds over the foreland of southeast china and enhances precipitation in southern and eastern china warmer sea surface temperature sst in eastern south indian ocean and cooler sst in western south indian ocean enhance precipitation in southern china and the anomalous vertical circulations including two branches ascending branch of the western north pacific and descending branch of the south indian ocean and southern china are associated with southern china rainfall and eastern south indian ocean sst anomalies chen et al 2014 jia and ge 2017 investigated interdecadal changes of the relationship between winter precipitation anomalies in southeastern china and enso or eawm at the end of the twentieth century and it suggested that the relationships between the interannual variability of winter precipitation in southeastern china and enso or eawm are weakened after 1998 99 besides huang et al 2017 indicated that the strengthening of siberian high enhanced the eawm and weakened southwesterly winds over the south china sea which further reduce the precipitation in southern china in contrast to summertime mjo in wintertime is more active and shows notable effects on wintertime precipitation regimes at different time scales previous researches have investigated the precipitation changes in east asia during boreal winter at intraseasonal scale e g yao et al 2015 yao et al 2015 explained the leading eof modes of wintertime precipitation by phases 3 and 5 of the mjo and it indicated that the variance of intraseasonal precipitation in china is influenced by the variance of tropical convection and the cold surge in winter hung et al 2014 suggested that precipitation in taiwan increased in phases 3 and 4 of the mjo and reduced in phases 7 and 8 jeong et al 2008 found that the precipitation variation over east asia reaches 3 4 mm day between wet and dry periods when the locations of mjo convection centers shifted over the indian ocean and western pacific in addition lim et al 2017 indicated that the rainfall pattern of southeast asia was mainly dominated by cold surges css and mjo increases the convection and enhances precipitation compared to css solely however most of the researches on mjo mainly focus on the impacts of mjo phases on precipitation and few detailed researches are available to address the impacts of the strengths or intensity of mjo activities on wintertime precipitation over eastern china in addition mechanism of the mjo influence on wintertime precipitation is still unclear this study emphasizes the response of precipitation to the strength of mjo and weather there were significant differences of precipitation while the strength of mjo activities are extremely high low moreover this study further investigated the moisture transport conditions and the associated teleconnections of the mjo and try to explain the precipitation pattern under different mjo events herein we aim to explore the issues as followings a how mjo activities influence wintertime precipitation regimes over eastern china and what is the underlying physical process and mechanisms b what are spatiotemporal properties of wintertime precipitation over eastern china during different phases and strengths of mjo activities to answer above mentioned scientific issues will be of great importance to the understand changes of wintertime precipitation regimes in both space and time and also for water resources and agricultural management in eastern china the aims of this study are to 1 investigate the properties of mjo events and different mjo phases 2 identify the impacts of the strengths and phases of mjo activities on wintertime precipitation regimes in eastern china and 3 bring insight into the underlying mechanisms of the mjo impacts the rest part of this paper is organized as followings section 2 described the datasets and methodologies including the diagnosis of mjo events and the classification of active inactive mjo events section 3 presented the main results of the study including the main mjo features properties of mjo phases the role of enso on mjo associated precipitation

which has been widely used in previous mjo researches barreto et al 2017 kim et al 2009 in this study mjo index was calculated by using the daily olr u850 and u200 anomalies data based on the band pass filtering with the band width of 20 100 days unfiltered daily anomalies in this study are computed by subtracting the climatological daily means calculated using all years of the daily data as suggested by waliser et al 2009 2 5 empirical orthogonal function eof the empirical orthogonal function eof analysis tends to identify physical and dynamically independent patterns or normal modes montroy 1997 kim and wu 1999 kim 2017 in this study mjo index was derived based on eof analysis 2 6 water vapor flux and water vapor flux divergence water vapor flux or moisture flux indicate the magnitude and direction of the transportation of water vapor in the atmosphere it is a measurement of the intensity and direction of water vapor transport which is given by the water vapor flow running through an air parcel during a unit time interval the water vapor flux equation at a certain air pressure level e g 850 hpa is q v q g where q refers to water vapor flux v is the wind velocity q the relative humidity and g is the acceleration due to gravity water vapor flux divergence convergence indicates moisture budget for an air parcel during a unit time interval water vapor flux divergence convergence at a certain air pressure level it is given by f q u x q v y where f denotes water vapor flux divergence and qu qv is zonal meridional water vapor flux 2 7 identification of mjo index wheeler and hendon 2004 developed a diagnosis for identification of mjo events using the multivariate eof analysis based on the equatorial average of olr u850 and u200 in this study an mjo is defined by the empirical orthogonal functions eofs of the near equatorial 15 s 15 n averaged daily zonal wind at 850 and 200 hpa and olr data applying band pass filtering as suggested by waliser et al 2009 the first two normalized principal component pc time series called rmm1 and rmm2 were defined as the index of mjo real time rmms data are available at the bureau of meteorology of australia http www bom gov au climate mjo it shall be noted that in this study the rmm data was calculated again based on the u850 u200 and olr filtered data it can be better to present the characteristics of intraseasonal period 20 100 days 2 8 identification of active inactive mjo events mjo index in this study was defined as rmm 1 2 r m m 2 2 daily rmm index 1 was defined as active mjo day and mjo index 1 was defined as inactive mjo day and wintertime in this study refers to winter half year of north hemisphere waliser et al 2009 i e november to april of the next year therefore study period in this study includes the wintertime from 1979 to 2012 from november of 1979 to april of 2013 therefore strength of mjo activities can be quantified based on rmm index in this study strength of each mjo event was computed by 91 day moving window centered at each day of the wintertime from 1979 to 2012 to better quantify impacts of mjo events on wintertime precipitation in eastern china two types of mjo events were defined the series of 91 day running mean rmm index from 1979 to 2012 were standardized and the extreme mjo events were selected as the two types of mjo events i e active inactive mjo events based on the standardized rmm series 2 9 precipitation anomalies and test of significance long term daily means daily climatology of precipitation were calculated from daily data and daily precipitation anomalies were calculated by subtracting the daily climatology annual cycle from the raw daily data the diagnosis of statistical significance in this study is based on student s t test two sided precipitation anomalies were analyzed based on the comparations between the precipitation of extreme mjo events and long term daily means daily climatology precipitation the statistical significance of precipitation anomalies during different types of mjo events were estimated by the test statistic t of t test it is calculated as t x 1 x 2 n 1 1 s 1 2 n 2 1 s 2 2 n 1 n 2 2 1 n 1 1 n 2 where x 1 x 2 are the mean of two samples s 1 2 s 2 2 are the sample standard deviation and n 1 n 2 are the sample size if the observed t statistic exceeds the critical value determined by the appropriate reference distribution the null hypothesis i e h0 two samples has no significant difference is rejected the critical value depends on the significance level of the test the probability of erroneously rejecting the null hypothesis values of 0 10 or less 0 05 in this research are commonly used as the critical levels of significance α 0 05 indicating the precipitation is significantly difference from long term mean precipitation with 95 percent confidence the confidence level is 1 α 3 results 3 1 the main mjo features and mjo phases properties fig 2 shows long term mean shaded in fig 2 and root mean square deviation rmsd contour in fig 2 of olr u850 and u200 fig 2a showed a strong convection in indonesia islands maritime continent 90 e 150 e 15 s 15 n indicated larger water vapor content and high cloud coverage in these regions however weak convection can be observed in tropical regions in the eastern pacific 120 w 170 w 15 s 15 e indicating no evident atmospheric convection activities and lower cloud coverage in these regions fig 2a besides spatial pattern of u850 indicates that the indonesia islands showed as tropical convergence regions fig 2b and the divergence center can also be observed over indonesia islands at 200 hpa pressure level suggesting that the indonesia islands or the maritime continent was the tropical convention center therefore u850 u200 and olr can combine to reflect tropical atmospheric activities and energy distribution in north hemisphere during winter season based on previous researches e g waliser et al 2009 rmm1 and rmm2 can be used for the classification of the eight mjo phases indicating the eastward propagation of tropical convention center different phases decide the position of tropical convection center of mjo activities for instance phases 2 and 3 indicated the tropical convection activities mainly concentrated at indian ocean while phases 6 and 7 indicated the tropical convention center located at the western pacific eight mjo phases were analyzed respectively based on dates with mjo index larger than 1 and then observed precipitation changes and associated water vapor propagation in east asia of different mjo phases were investigated fig 3 and fig 4 analyzed the variance of precipitation and associated anomalies of water vapor transport influenced by mjo phases fig 3 demonstrates spatial distribution of in situ observed precipitation anomalies of the eight mjo phases across china fig 4 are associated water vapor transport conditions of the eight mjo phases respectively distinct differences of precipitation anomalies can be observed among different mjo phases fig 3 in phase 2 fig 3b enhanced precipitation can be observed in some regions of eastern china at around 30 n then in phase 3 fig 3c the rainfall belt propagated southward and evident enhancement of precipitation can be detected in foreland of southeastern china thereafter in phases 4 5 coastal regions of southeastern china were still dominated by enhanced precipitation however it can be detected that area with enhanced precipitation became narrowed and decrease of precipitation can be observed at around 30 n difference between southern china and northern china can be observed in phase 5 fig 3e and increasing precipitation anomalies can be observed in coastal regions of southeastern china while reduced precipitation can be detected in northern china in phases 6 and 7 of mjo fig 3f 3 g reduced precipitation can be observed in most of the eastern china especially in southeastern china fig 4 shows 850 hpa moisture transport conditions of 8 mjo phases water vapor flux measures intensity of moisture transport and water vapor divergence indicates water vapor budget lower tropospheric has the greatest impact on precipitation and 850 hpa wind and moisture transport has been widely used to investigate the precipitation patterns e g pai et al 2011 zhang et al 2017 fig 4 illustrates the water vapor transport anomalies of different mjo phases wherein evident anomalies of water vapor flux can be detected in mjo phases 2 3 6 and 7 in phases 2 and 3 p2 and p3 in fig 4 water vapor flux anomalies from indian ocean western pacific and south china sea propagates northwards and reaches eastern china it may imply that vapor transport from western pacific to eastern china enhanced during phases 2 and 3 and it was benefit to the occurrence of precipitation adverse conditions can be observed in phases 6 and 7 p6 and p7 in fig 4 and water vapor flux propagates southwards therefore in phases 6 and 7 northward water vapor transport from south china sea and indian ocean become weaker so less moisture can reach eastern china therefore under these mjo phases the moisture transport conditions were unfavorable to the occurrence of precipitation in eastern china water vapor convergence anomalies can be found over foreland of southeastern china in phases 2 and 3 while water vapor divergence anomalies can be found over these regions during phases 6 and 7 which is corresponding to the anomalies of water vapor flux during these phases the moisture transport conditions can well explain the precipitation anomalies of different mjo phases in phases 2 3 water vapor flux from indian ocean south china sea and western pacific provided sufficient moisture for the occurrence of precipitation in eastern china on the contrast in phases 6 7 southward water vapor propagation was unfavorable to the occurrence of precipitation furthermore it was found that precipitation in eastern china had close relationship with water vapor transport over east asia and western pacific meanwhile water vapor transport can be used to explain the transitions between mjo phases and relevant precipitation variations from phases 2 3 to phases 6 7 eastern china showed enhanced southward moisture transport and weakened northward moisture transport from south china sea simultaneously the rainfall belt in eastern china propagated southward from phases 2 3 to phases 6 7 mjo activities strongly affected the spatial temporal features of moisture transport and precipitation in eastern china previous studies tang and yu 2008 peng et al 2011 peng et al 2019 shimizu et al 2017 have shown that enso is closely correlated to the mjo events to further analyze the interactions of enso and mjo on precipitation this study analyzed the precipitation changes during the mjo lifecycle on different enso phases in fig 3 mjo has remarkable impacts on southeastern china green rectangle area in fig 3 and fig 5 shows precipitation anomalies of different mjo phases over this area during warm cold enso periods it shows that enso has great impacts on precipitation and winter precipitation shows great differences between warm and cold enso events over south china during warm enso periods the precipitation enhanced in all phases of mjo over south china while precipitation varied from different mjo phases during cold enso periods precipitation was increased in phases 3 4 while it was decreased in phases 6 8 it is consistent with previous studies karori et al 2013 that el niño warm enso periods will increase the precipitation over southeastern china whereas there are no significant reduction of precipitation during la niña cold enso periods although enso activities may have great impacts on precipitation the variations of precipitation during the lifecycle of mjo show many common features between warm and cold enso periods in both warm and cold enso periods the precipitation changed similarly during mjo lifecycle specifically precipitation was enhanced in phases 2 5 and weakened in phases 6 8 this suggests that different enso events may affect the magnitude of winter precipitation over southeastern china but it will not change the trend of winter precipitation during mjo lifecycle in addition interactions of mjo and nao ao were investigated by some previous studies zhou and miller 2005 lin et al 2007 lin et al 2009 these studies indicated that the mjo would greatly affect the extratropical circulations by the rossby wave in the pacific sector however influence of nao on tropical circulations was mainly detected over tropical atlantic africa lin et al 2007 2009 but not in the pacific sector zhou and miller 2005 also suggested that the influence of ao on tropical circulations is not as evident as the mjo influence on tropical circulations therefore we think the precipitation changes among different mjo phases were mainly caused by the transitions of mjo activities but not the enso nao and the response of precipitation to the changes of mjo activities should be further investigated since it has some characteristics which were not caused by enso nao events fig 6 illustrates the rmm1 rmm2 index 2d phase space as the determination of mjo events mjo indices inside the solid circle indicate inactive mjo i e smaller than 1 rmm index and mjo indices outside the solid circle indicate active mjo fig 6a indicates phase space diagram for active mjo events light blue curves indicate rmm1 rmm2 changes during extreme mjo events i e active mjo events at 2004 1984 1997 1989 2012 and 1988 inactive mjo events at 1983 1980 2000 2010 1995 and 1990 while colorful curves indicate a typical mjo event active mjo events at 2004 and inactive mjo events at 1983 and different colors denote different months fig 6b is similar to fig 6a but refers to inactive mjo events it can be observed from fig 6 that strength and phases of mjo in different years are subject to distinct difference the mjo index or the rmms are mainly at a high level more than 1 during active mjo events and it is easy to find some days which exceed 2 while the rmms mainly around or less than 1 during inactive mjo events meanwhile it can be detected for phase changes of mjo events that during active mjo events from phase 1 to phase 8 the rmm index showed shifts in anticlockwise direction the time scale for an entire period is 30 60 days which is corresponding to a mjo life cycle however it is difficult to see shifts in anticlockwise direction during inactive mjo events suggesting that the position tropical convention center did not move eastward as active mjo did 3 2 wintertime precipitation under impacts of active inactive mjo events fig 7 illustrates the precipitation anomalies during active inactive mjo events during active mjo events fig 7a the precipitation in eastern china is mainly increased especially increase significantly in the foreland of southeastern china during inactive mjo events fig 7b the precipitation in eastern china reduce dominantly typically the precipitation of northeastern china inland regions of central china and the foreland of southeastern china has reduced significantly in particular precipitation reduction is most pronounced in southeastern china which implies a higher risk of drought in these regions during inactive mjo events to better understand the precipitation variations during active inactive mjo events this study analyzed the precipitation anomalies in active inactive events based on eight mjo phases fig 8 shows spatial distribution of the precipitation anomalies over eastern china during active mjo event from fig 8 the precipitation anomalies over eastern china show significant differences among eight mjo phases the precipitation in southeastern china area in green rectangle 21 n 28 n 110 e 120 e was mainly increased in phases 2 4 especially in phase 3 from phase 6 the southeastern china began to show decreased precipitation therefore the increased precipitation anomalies in southeastern china during active mjo events in fig 7a is mainly caused by the increase of precipitation in the mjo phases 2 5 it can also be seen from fig 7 that dipole features can be detected in some phases e g phases 3 5 between southern china and north china that demarcated by the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river at around 30 n abnormal increase of precipitation was found in southeastern china south of 30 n while reduced precipitation was observed over northern china and the jiang huai regions area in purple rectangle 29 n 35 n 113 e 123 e in phases 4 5 on the other hand precipitation was decreased in southeastern china while it was increased in north china from phase 7 therefore precipitation in different regions shows an evident change between different phases in the mjo event cycle the significant increase in precipitation in southeastern china under active mjo events was mainly attributed to the abnormal increase of precipitation in phases 2 5 fig 9 shows the spatial distribution of the precipitation anomalies over eastern china during inactive mjo event from fig 9 that there is a significant difference between the precipitation anomalies in inactive mjo events and that in active mjo events although the jiang huai regions area in purple rectangle showed significant enhanced precipitation in phase 2 most of the other phases showed an abnormal decrease in precipitation especially in phase 8 most regions in southeastern china showed significant precipitation reduction compared with mjo active events the precipitation reduced in most phases during inactive mjo events especially in phases 3 5 the precipitation in southeastern china increased significantly during the active mjo event while increased precipitation can hardly be detected during the inactive mjo events and precipitation decreased in most of the regions during the inactive mjo events eastern china is mainly dominated by decreased precipitation at most mjo phases which may be the main reason for the precipitation reduction during inactive mjo inactive events as shown in fig 7b fig 8 and fig 9 showed that extreme mjo events have great impacts on precipitation over southeastern china in addition jiang huai regions showed distinct precipitation anomalies in several mjo phases during extreme mjo events to analyze the characteristics of precipitation over different regions in eastern china table 1 shows the precipitation anomalies of southeastern china area in green rectangle 21 n 28 n 110 e 120 e and jiang huai regions area in purple rectangle 29 n 35 n 113 e 123 e during two types of extreme mjo events it reveals that during the active mjo events southeastern china showed significant increase in phases 2 4 and significant decrease in phase 6 in the jiang huai regions there is no significant precipitation anomalies in all phases except for phase 4 during inactive mjo events precipitation in phase 1 and phase 6 over jiang huai regions decreased significantly while precipitation in phase 2 increased significantly however only precipitation in phase 8 was significantly reduced over southeastern china compared with no significant anomalies in precipitation during other phases this may imply that active mjo activities have great impacts on the precipitation over southeastern china and when mjo activities is inactive precipitation anomalies are mainly occurred in the jiang huai area and mjo may have less impacts on the precipitation over southeastern china 3 3 moisture transport background under active inactive mjo events we now process to investigate the physical process and mechanism behind the mjo events that impacts on precipitation variations of eastern china including large scale moisture transport the propagation of mjo convention center and geopotential as well as wind field fig 10 shows the moisture transport anomalies under active and inactive mjo events under the active mjo events fig 10a on the east coast of the eurasian continent at around 120 e significant anomalies of moisture transport can be detected from south to north along south china sea and east china sea and there are evident water vapor convergence regions in the foreland of southern china as for the jiang huai regions and the north china region north of yangtze river at around 28 n 30 n these regions are mainly dominated by water vapor divergence it may imply that the enhanced water vapor transport from the south china sea in southern china may led to the enhancement of precipitation over these regions while precipitation may decrease over regions north of the yangtze river for the inactive mjo event fig 10b most of eastern china and the western pacific e g east china sea are characterized by water vapor divergence which may be unfavorable to the occurrence of precipitation over these regions to study the effects of different phases under extreme mjo events fig 11 12 shows the water vapor transport anomalies at different phases of the mjo life cycle under active inactive mjo events it can be detected from fig 11 that the anomalies of water vapor transport between different phases has significant differences and it showed large variance between phases of mjo life cycle at phases 2 3 there are significant enhanced water vapor transport over south china sea the moisture transported northward from south china sea is significantly enhanced accompanying a large amount of water vapors from south china sea being transported to southern china and the foreland of southeastern china also exhibits anomalies of water vapor convergence which may explain the moisture transport conditions for the significant enhancement of precipitation of these phases in fig 8 afterwards the northward water vapor transport from south china sea weakened rapidly and there was no evident water vapor transport anomaly in phase 6 over south china sea and the southeastern china began to be dominated by water vapor divergence which is consistent with the reduced precipitation in southern china in fig 8 therefore the significant enhancement of precipitation in southeastern china under the active mjo events is mainly caused by the increase of precipitation in phases 2 4 the increased water vapor flux from south china sea under these phases transports a large amount of water vapor northward to southeastern china which may provide sufficient water vapor conditions and be beneficial to the significant increase in precipitation in southeastern china fig 12 illustrates the water vapor transport anomalies at the 8 phases of the mjo life cycle under inactive mjo events it can be seen from the figure that it is difficult to observe the distinct change pattern of water vapor transport between phases during inactive mjo events nevertheless some features of water vapor transport can be observed in several phases for instance there is significant water vapor transport anomalies southward over south china sea in phase 8 accompanying anomalies of water vapor divergence over southeastern china indicating that the moisture content in the atmosphere over these regions was reduced which may be unfavorable to the occurrence of precipitation in these regions which is consistent with the significant precipitation reduction in phase 8 fig 8 meanwhile it can be found that except for the phase 2 most of the eastern china are mainly characterized by water vapor divergence which is also consistent with the reduced precipitation as shown in fig 8 3 4 the physical mechanism of mjo activities on wintertime precipitation fig 13 14 illustrated the outgoing longwave radiation olr and wind field anomalies in the tropical regions of the indian ocean and the western pacific 20 s 20 n 50 e 160 w under active inactive mjo events it can be used to study the propagation of the tropical convection center under different mjo events fig 13 shows that from phase 1 to phase 8 the tropical convection center propagated eastward from the indian ocean to the western pacific in phase 1 the tropical convention center was being generated in the indian ocean while the indonesia islands maritime continent were mainly represented as a weak convection zone in phase 2 an obvious convection center had been generated in the indian ocean in phases 3 and 4 the tropical convection center moves eastward gradually indonesia islands maritime continent became the center of the active convection activities in phase 5 while the indian ocean began to appear as an inactive convection zone in phase 6 the tropical convection center continued moving eastward to the western pacific followed by the weak convention area also moving from the indian ocean to the maritime continent in phases 7 and 8 as the weak convection area moved eastward to the maritime continent convection activities become weakened over the maritime continent as can be seen from fig 14 the activities of the convention center during inactive mjo events had large differences compared with that of active mjo events the tropical convection center of the active mjo events showed an obvious propagation from west to east from phase 1 to phase 8 and gradually moved from the african and indian oceans to the mid eastern pacific tropical regions however during the inactive mjo events the tropical convection center hardly propagated or changed the position obviously during the transit of mjo phases the tropical convection center of almost all phases is around the maritime it can also confirm that the rmm index can well reflect the mjo activities and the propagations of tropical convention center to find out the mechanism of mjo activities that impact on precipitation of eastern china fig 15 16 show the large scale 500 hpa geopotential and 850 hpa wind field of different phases under active inactive mjo events it can be seen from fig 15 that at phase 1 the western pacific regions including japan sea of okhotsk were dominated by high pressure while the depression over eastern china was developing and at the following phases 2 3 this atmospheric pressure pattern was more obvious at this time high pressure anomalies appeared over the east side of the eurasian continent and western pacific while depression gradually dominated the southeastern china and the eastern eurasian continent from phases 4 or 5 regions of western pacific still appeared high pressure anomalies but it retreated northeastward to the northern pacific bering sea while the depression over southeastern china strengthened and moved eastward to the eastern coastal china and western pacific and high pressure anomalies began to appear in indian peninsula at phases 6 7 and 8 the depression center propagated eastward gradually from northwestern pacific such as sea of okhotsk kamchatka peninsula to mid or eastern pacific such as bering sea accompanying the high pressure anomalies in the indian ocean region extended northeastward to the eurasian continent resulting in high pressure anomalies appeared over eastern eurasian continent including eastern china east china sea and western pacific it can be inferred that phases 1 8 represents a lifecycle of mjo activities accompanied by the northeastward propagations of the atmospheric pressure pattern from the tropical indian ocean to the high latitude northern pacific and the bering sea in boreal winter eurasian continent is dominated by east asia siberian high while western pacific is relatively appeared depression which make the eastern eurasian continent including the eastern china dominated by northerly winds but at mjo phases 2 and 3 the eastern china appeared negative geopotential anomalies while northwestern pacific appeared positive geopotential anomalies and it means eastern china is dominated by low pressure anomalies while western pacific is dominated by high pressure anomalies therefore it may imply that the pressure gradient decreased and westerly wind weakened over eurasian continent and western pacific and it results in anomalous southerly wind along coastal regions of east asia which is benefit for the moisture transport from south china sea to southeastern china as for phases 6 8 regions of northern and central pacific and aleutian islands were dominated by depression while eastern china is dominated by east asia high resulting in the eastern china mainly dominated by northerly wind which is not benefit to the precipitation of these regions it may explain the mechanism of the anomalies of moisture transport as well the precipitation variations during active mjo events it can be seen from fig 16 that compared with the active mjo events the 500 hpa geopotential and 850 hpa wind field under the inactive mjo events are difficult to find out a life cycle as active mjo events did except for phase 2 the eastern part of the eurasian continent and the western pacific are mainly dominated by anomalous depression while the high pressure occurred at high latitudes regions north of 50 n and converse only in the northwestern pacific such as japan or sea of okhotsk of phase 2 was dominated by anomalous high pressure while the eastern china is dominated by anomalous low pressure at the same phase it can be speculated that the active mjo events and the eastward propagations of the convection center in the tropics as shown in fig 13 and fig 14 may stimulate the periodic changes of the atmospheric pressure pattern fig 15 and fig 16 in eastern china the tropical convection center propagated eastward from the indonesian peninsula to the middle east and the pacific ocean during the mjo lifecycle as an atmospheric rossby wave response the atmospheric pressure pattern along the indian peninsula eastern china and western pacific regions propagated northeastward following the changes of mjo phases and it led to the transition from the depression phases 2 4 to the high pressure phases 6 8 over eastern china which may further affect the moisture transport and precipitation over these regions 4 conclusion and discussions this study attempts to examine the spatiotemporal patterns of wintertime precipitation in different mjo events and causes from viewpoints of water vapor transport some interesting and important conclusions were obtained as follows 1 precipitation over eastern china and associated moisture transport showed evident changes among different mjo phases during mjo phase 2 and 3 plenty of atmospheric moisture from indian ocean western pacific and south china sea transported northward and reaches eastern china resulting in enhanced precipitation over southeastern china while during mjo phases 6 and 7 most regions in southeastern china showed abnormal southward moisture transport and moisture divergence which is unfavorable to the occurrence of precipitation 2 during active mjo events precipitation enhanced significantly in southeastern china and it was mainly attributed to the increased precipitation in phase 2 5 it can be partly explained by the atmospheric moisture transport conditions significant anomalies of atmospheric moisture transport were detected from the south china sea to southeastern china during phase 2 4 which may provide sufficient water vapor for the enhancement of precipitation in southeastern china 3 during inactive mjo events precipitation decreased significantly in southeastern china with most of the mjo phases shows reduced precipitation in these regions and it may lead to a higher risk of drought over southeastern china during wintertime with non active mjo activities in jiang huai regions significant increased precipitation can be detected in phase 2 while significant decreased precipitation occurred in phase 1 and 6 during inactive mjo events however the integration of all phases did not show significant precipitation anomalies over jiang huai regions 4 during active mjo events the tropical convection center showed a distinct propagation from west to east from phase 1 to phase 8 gradually moving from the indian ocean to the central and eastern of tropical pacific as an atmospheric rossby wave response eastward propagation of tropical convention center stimulated a northeastward propagation of atmospheric pressure pattern over east asia which results in the transition from the depression phase 2 4 to the high pressure phase 6 8 over eastern china and it may further affect the atmospheric moisture transport conditions and finally lead to the precipitation anomalies over these regions this study investigated atmospheric circulation and associated spatial patterns of wintertime precipitation in eastern china based different mjo events and mjo phases besides impacts of mjo on wintertime precipitation variations in eastern china and the potential mechanisms were investigated however more interesting scientific issues are necessary to be explored on further ongoing work for instance further investigations on the simulation and forecast of mjo and the evolutions of mjo activities are of great worth to improve the forecast skill of tropical and extratropical precipitation and even the predictivity of global or regional weather and climate patterns to solve these questions regional climate models of forecast systems may be feasible and useful such as the weather research and forecasting wrf model alaka and maloney 2017 and the predictive ocean atmosphere model for australia poama seasonal forecast system marshall et al 2011 2017 moreover more works are also necessary for analysis on teleconnections of mjo to global weather and climate patterns including climate factors like enso or nao or the monsoon activities in east asia it may be explained by some theories of the low frequency wave mode such as the rossby wave train

5769,the flow sediment and temperature regimes of the yangtze river have changed greatly due to the construction of the three gorges reservoir tgr although past work has focused mainly on the influence of the tgr on water and sediment regimes less attention has been given to temperature effects water temperature changes have important implications for the quality of aquatic habitat and the health of the river ecosystem this study investigates the impact of the tgr on the water temperature regime along the middle reach of the yangtze river to accurately quantify the impact of tgr on water temperature a regression modeling framework is employed to reconstruct the temporal pattern of flow and temperature variation along the middle reach of the river in the absence of the tgr based on this modeling reconstructed water temperatures are compared to observed water temperature for the post impounded period period 2003 2014 to estimate the influence of impoundment on water temperature results show that the influence of the tgr on water temperature alteration exceeds the influence of natural factors the effect of tgr relative to unimpounded conditions is to reduce water temperatures in the spring summer and autumn and to increase water temperatures in the winter the results of this study illustrate the pronounced effect of the tgr on the temperature regime of the yangtze river and provide information that can help guide operation of three gorges reservoir to enhance biological conservation keywords water temperature three gorges reservoir reconstruction

et al 2018 formulated a large scale spatio temporal model in which a linear function is used to relate maximum daily water temperature to air temperature showing that the relationship between these two variables is linear besides air temperature changes in runoff volumes are also known to affect water temperature langan et al 2001 webb et al 2003 van vliet et al 2012 however the relationship between discharge and water temperature remains poorly understood a critical need exists to determine how air temperature and discharge influence the water temperature of rivers three gorges reservoir tgr the largest water control project in the world provides numerous benefits that contribute to economic prosperity and social well being on the other hand the tgr has substantially altered the hydrological and thermal regimes of the yangtze river by changing the amount and timing of flow and by producing thermal stratification within the reservoir that results in the release of hypolimnetic water wang et al 2012 chen et al 2016 long et al 2016 cai et al 2018 it also markedly affects the behavior and distributions of aquatic species long et al 2016 wang et al 2017 for these reasons water temperature variations downstream associated with the tgr have been of considerable interest however previous analysis attributed differences of water temperature downstream and upstream of the reservoir to operation of the tgr without considering effects of other factors unrelated to the tgr e g changing climate condition on changes in downstream water temperature zou et al 2011 long et al 2016 to fully assess the effects of tgr on water temperature reconstruction of water temperatures from meteorological and hydrological data in the absence of the reservoir is necessary as the basis for reconstruction natural river flow without the reservoir needs to be simulated using a general regression neural network grnn which outperforms other neural network methods kim et al 2013 tayfur et al 2014 the main objective of this study is to determine the extent to which construction of the tgr has changed water temperatures within the yangtze river downstream of the reservoir to achieve this objective the study 1 develops a predictive regression model of water temperature in the river based on air temperature and discharge 2 uses the model to reconstruct water temperatures for the post impoundment period in the absence of impoundment and 3 assesses the influence of the tgr on water temperatures by comparing observed and predicted values of water temperature in the post impoundment period quantitative assessment of the impact of the reservoir on river water temperature informs future science based management of the reservoir aimed at minimizing adverse ecological effects 2 study area and data the yangtze river is the longest river in asia and the third longest river in the world it passes through its source in qinghai province eastward to the east china sea at shanghai the river is about 6300 km long and its catchment covers 1 800 000 km2 xu et al 2006 the basin includes zones of subtropical and temperate climate li et al 2011 the tgr is located along the main stream of yangtze river between chongqing and yichang fig 1 the tgr started to impound water in 2003 and became fully operational in 2009 the reservoir has a water storage capacity of 39 3 km3 about 4 5 of yangtze s annual discharge wang et al 2017 the tgr is operated to accommodate multiple needs including flood control irrigation and power generation with amounts of released water varying seasonally cai et al 2018 yichang hydrological station located 44 km downstream of tgr provided information on discharge and water temperature below the reservoir fig 1 discharge data for cuntan and wulong hydrological stations located in the upper yangtze river were used to reconstruct time series of natural discharge in the absence of the tgr at yichang since 2003 daily water temperature at yichang and discharge at the three hydrological stations for the pre tgr 1952 2002 and post tgr 2003 2015 periods were provided by the yangtze river water resources commission daily air temperature data for 1956 to 2015 at yichang meteorological station were obtained from the national meteorological information center http data cma cn 3 research design and methods the research design to address the main objective of the study involves several sequential components fig 2 first observed daily data on water temperature wt air temperature t a and discharge q were used to develop a set of multivariate regression models predicting water temperature on the basis of air temperature and discharge although past work has indicated that multivariate relations between water temperature and independent variables can be nonlinear mohseni et al 1998 the use of multivariate linear regression analysis is justified in this study given linear relationships between water temperature and air temperature and between water temperature and discharge table 1 the general model has the form 1 wt t β 0 β 1 t a t l β 2 q t where β0 β1 and β2 are regression coefficients t is time and l is a time lag the need to include a lag effect for air temperature reflects the tendency for water temperature variations to be delayed relative to air temperature fluctuations at daily time scales erickson and stefan 2000 webb et al 2003 the root mean squared error rmse is used to evaluate how well the regression model fits the data 2 rmse y t y t 2 n where y t is the simulated value yt is the observed value and n is the sample size linear multivariate water temperature regression models were estimated for each month with different time lags based on daily air temperature and discharge table 2 a daily time scale was chosen because compared to monthly or seasonal time scales exploratory regression analysis based on daily data yielded the lowest rmse separate sets of monthly models were fitted to data for periods before 1983 2002 and after 2003 2014 the construction of the tgr wtsim pre tgr represents estimates of the water temperature derived from the linear water temperature regression models in the pre tgr period 1983 2002 the corresponding coefficients of these models are β0 pre tgr β1 pre tgr and β2 pre tgr similarly values of wtsim post tgr are post tgr estimates of water temperature associated with coefficients β0 post tgr β1 post tgr and β2 post tgr the optimal time lag was determined by varying the lag and selecting the value that produced the lowest rmse the second step in the methodology involves reconstructing what the natural variation in discharge at yichang station would have been since 2003 in the absence of the tgr this step in the analysis is necessary so that the influence of discharge on water temperature in the post impoundment period 2003 2013 in the absence of impoundment can be estimated to accomplish this task a general regression neural network grnn model was generated using discharge data for cuntan and wulong hydrological stations which represent inflows of the tgr and are major components of discharge at yichang grnn is a one pass neural network learning algorithm specht 1991 consistent with the basic principle of all neural networks grnn requires training data to train itself based on input output mapping after a trained model is developed it can be used to estimate outputs for test data the basic equation associated with grnn is 3 y i y k k x x k k x x k where yi the output or prediction y k is an activation weight x is the input and x k is the training sample the activation function k x xk is 4 k x x k e d i 2 2 σ 2 where d k x x k t x x k and σ is a spread constant optimization involves determining the value of σ that minimizes the mean square error when outputs are predicted based on the model developed for the training data to apply grnn on a daily basis a lag effect is incorporated because discharge variations at yichang tend to lag behind those at cuntan and wulong by about two days on average for model development 80 of the data prior to dam construction were used for training 1952 1991 and 20 1992 2002 were used for testing tayfur et al 2014 the performance of the grnn model is assessed using the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse 5 nse 1 t 1 n y t y t 2 t 1 n y t y 2 where y t is the simulated value yt is the observed value and y is the mean value of observed data an nse of 1 0 corresponds to a perfect match between simulated and observed values the closer nse is to 1 0 the more accurate the model is if nse 0 5 forecasting is feasible moriasi et al 2007 in step three the set of monthly regressions models for the pre dam period were used to estimate values of wt in the absence

air temperature at yichang has varied between about 16 c and 18 c a slight downward trend is evident between 1956 and 1984 whereas an upward trend occurred between 1985 and 2006 fig 3 yichang experienced an extreme hot spell and drought during the summer of 2006 wu et al 2012 followed by a slight downward trend in annual air temperature between 2007 and 2015 the annual water temperature variation at yichang generally exhibits a similar pattern to air temperature between 1956 and 1973 annual water temperature increased slightly followed by a slight decrease from 1974 to 1985 a sustained increasing trend is evident from 1986 to 2006 at an average rate of 0 04 c per year as with air temperature the maximum of water temperature occurred in 2006 the extreme drought in the summer of 2006 apparently affected both air and water temperature at yichang this similarity in air and water temperature trends verifies the close correlation between the two variables which is related to the influence of solar radiation on both water and air temperature brown 1969 moore 1967 since impoundment in 2003 the mean annual water temperature has risen from 18 04 c to 18 86 c discharge at yichang has exhibited a slow decline since 1956 annual discharge from 1956 to 2002 was 13656 m3 s decreasing to 12668 m3 s after the impoundment of tgr a reduction of 7 2 4 1 2 intra annual variation as seen in fig 4 a monthly air temperature is almost consistent before and after the construction of tgr with the differences varying from 0 19 c to 1 42 c while monthly water temperature in the heating period from march to june has decreased 0 84 c to 2 39 c after impoundment and it has warmed slightly to 17 77 c in the cooling period from september to february fig 4 b overall the water temperature at yichang became less variable after impoundment and the lowest water temperature shifted from january and february to february and march river discharge changes greatly at intra annual time scales because 56 of the storage capacity of the three gorges reservoir is used for regulation of water discharges vary in conjunction with the schedule of regulated releases of water discharges in april may and december between 2003 and 2014 the period of impoundment are nearly the same as those before impoundment fig 4 c from june to november post impoundment discharges have decreased compared to mean monthly discharges from 1956 to 2002 during every flood season from mid june to late september the reservoir is operated to impound floodwaters and control the discharged flow zheng 2016 after the flood season early october tgr impounds water to increase the reservoir water level gradually to a surface elevation of 175 m during the low water season from january to march tgr releases water to sustain power generation and navigation in the reservoir area thus the mean monthly discharge has increased to 5195 m3 s 5597 m3 s higher than pre tgr period 4 2 performance of regression models values of rmse for linear regression models for each month in the pre tgr period range from 0 71 c to 1 21 c table 2 regression models for the post tgr period also perform well with rmse ranging from 0 71 c to 1 67 c the optimal time lags between water temperature and air temperature range from 2 to 30 days the lag days for may and november are equal to 30 indicating that the relations between the water temperatures of virtually all days in those months are strongly influenced by air temperatures from the preceding month the average optimal lag is slightly longer 14 days for the post dam set of models than for the pre dam set of models 8 days table 2 consistent with the previous study that water temperature responded more slowly to air temperature specifically after dam construction kędra and wiejaczka 2016 predicted patterns of water temperature over the year for both pre and post impoundment match closely the observed pattern fig 5 consistent with the lack of model bias ε 0 optimization of the grnn model yielded a nondimensional spread value σ of 0 03 nse value for discharge reached 0 89 higher than the satisfactory level of 0 5 and the model performance could be described as very good moriasi et al 2007 the result indicates the model accurately represents variation in the natural discharge at yichang without the effects of impoundment as expected the model predicts that since 2003 peak discharges would be greater and minimum discharges would be less than observed values of discharge if the flow was not regulated by the tgr fig 6 to evaluate uncertainties that may be propagated to reconstructed water temperatures based on the use of simulated discharges data for the pre dam period 1983 2002 were divided into subsets for training 1983 1996 and testing 1997 2002 periods models fitted to data for the training period were then used to estimate water temperatures for the testing period based on predicted discharges and data on air temperature reconstructed water temperatures for the testing period 1997 2002 were then compared to corresponding observed water temperatures relative errors in predicted monthly averaged water temperatures ranged from 8 3 1 6 with an average of 3 5 the nse for the testing period was 0 99 with an rmse of only 0 68 c these results indicate that reconstruction of water temperature using simulated discharges is highly accurate and that uncertainties associated with this method have little effect on subsequent analysis 4 3 assessing the impact of tgr on water temperature the sets of linear water temperature regression models combined with the prediction of discharge in the absence of tgr at yichang in 2003 2013 using the grnn model provides the basis for accurately quantifying the separate contributions of natural changes versus reservoir related changes on water temperature at yichang after the tgr seasonal and annual statistics were generated using eq 7 based on the observed and simulated water temperatures table 3 results reveal that total annual change in water temperature at yichang attributable to tgr δtgr is larger than change attributable to natural factors δnc overall the annual water temperature has increased by 0 67 c since impoundment of this total change only 0 16 c of warming is attributable to natural changes in air temperature and discharge δnc on the other hand reservoir operation has independently decreased water temperature by 0 65 c δtgr other factors not explicitly accounted for by the model δβ0 have produced the greatest change resulting in warming of 1 16 c the results also show that the relative impact of the tgr on water temperature varies seasonally seasonal impacts of tgr differ significantly p value 0 01 from those of natural factors based on a student s t test absolute differences of changes in water temperature attributable to tgr are 2 78 16 83 times those attributable to natural factors during relatively warm parts of the year march to november the tgr has a cooling effect ranging from 0 57 c to 1 29 c on water temperature this effect is consistent with release of water stored within the reservoir that because of the high thermal inertia of the stored water is cooler than expected based on air temperature similarly during the winter december to february the tgr has a slight warming effect 0 22 c perhaps reflecting the release of slightly warmer reservoir water compared to the water temperature that would occur if this temperature was strongly controlled by air temperature cai et al 2018 the cooling effect is greatest in the spring march to may 1 29 c and during this season the release of cool water from the tgr has had the greater impact on water temperature relative to natural changes in air temperature or discharge other factors reflected in δβ0 have led to a significant warming of water temperature in autumn and winter using eq 10 the contributions of changes in air water temperature interaction and of changes in discharge to changes in water temperature can be determined the construction of tgr has resulted in substantial changes in nearby land use land cover topography and evaporation wu et al 2012 which has in turn affected the sensitivity of water temperature to air temperature erickson and stefan 2000 langan et al 2001 webb et al 2008 moreover water storage within the tgr and thermal inertia associated with storage also affect the relationship between air temperature and water temperature as shown in table 4 changes in air water temperature interaction following the construction of the tgr have a cooling effect ranging from 0 26 c to 0 94 c in all four seasons the largest decrease 2 1 c occur in august when the water in the river should be quite warm tgr regulates the amount and timing of water releases for flood prevention power generation and navigation throughout the year which can change the relationship between water temperature and discharge especially given thermal inertia effects of stored water the results indicate that the altered pattern of discharge exerted different effects on water temperature in the four seasons a cooling effect in spring and autumn and a warming effect in summer and winter in march the changed pattern of flow has its maximum independent effect on water temperature producing cooling of 3 54 c compared to the independent effect of predicted unregulated discharges at this time of year flow within the river may normally be warming but thermal inertial of relatively cool reservoir water may promote cooling tgr experienced three operation stages which may contribute to impacts on water temperature at yichang through changes in the water volume stored in the reservoir and hence in its thermal inertia cai et al 2018 in june 2003 the water level of the tgr was raised to an elevation of 135 m and power generation began with the water being retained by a cofferdam the water level fluctuated seasonally between 136 and 143 m until 2006 initial stage from october 2006 to october 2008 transitional stage the water level rose to between 145 and 156 m and preliminary operations began by november 2008 standard normal stage the level of the reservoir reached its normal level of 175 m contributions related to tgr vary during different operational stages table 5 the results for standard normal stage are roughly consistent with effects throughout the period from 2003 to 2014 the cooling effect of tgr became enhanced in summer as the stage increased while warming trends developed in autumn and winter as the water level in the reservoir rose the clear variations in δtgr during different operation stages of tgr reinforce the assumption that tgr brought about significant impacts on water temperature behavior at yichang 5 discussion the framework developed and implemented in this study provides an improved method for determining the effects of natural factors versus reservoir impoundment on water temperature specifically it isolates the separate contributions of natural factors versus impoundment using a water temperature regression model that captures the changes induced by varying external conditions this research has refined the analysis of the effects of dams on water temperature variations by accounting for factors other than the presence of the dam that could produce differences in water temperature characteristics before and after impoundment besides air temperature and discharge other factors such as sewage discharges land use changes and industrial pollution can influence water temperature cai et al 2018 these other influences are accounted for in the modeling by changes in the coefficient β0 the findings of this study reveal that these other factors have had the most important influence on water temperature in the river below the tgr which needs further work to identify the way in which these factors influence water temperature however the effect of the tgr exceeds the effect related to natural factors with the tgr producing net cooling during all but the coldest parts of the year past studies have revealed that reservoirs can substantially change hydrological and thermal regimes downstream and that this impact can extend for tens to hundreds of kilometers petts 1986 richter et al 1998 soja and wiejaczka 2014 this study confirms that the construction of the tgr has had an important independent effect on the water temperature regime of the yangtze river downstream of the tgr consistent with previous findings the findings are also consistent with results of previous work indicating that natural synchronization between air temperature and water temperature has changed since initiation of reservoir operation kedra and wiejaczka 2018 the analysis in this study supports the conclusion that the interaction between air temperature and water temperature has weakened following dam construction past work has not considered explicitly the linkage between water temperature and discharge whereas the findings of this study show that the connection between discharge and water temperature is also affected by the operation of the tgr it may be feasible to produce river water temperatures sufficiently close to natural temperatures using adaptive management strategies designed to restore environmental river flows gu et al 1999 richter and thomas 2007 for that purpose monitoring river flow and air temperature downstream of dams and quantifying the respective contributions of these factors to thermal regime are necessary to facilitate modeling of future scenarios based on modification of reservoir outflows different from other statistical methods for water temperature reconstruction that seek to quantify the separate contributions of climate and human interventions e g air2stream model this study has used a linear regression model to isolate the effects of changes in air water temperature interaction and the pattern of discharge produced by dam construction on the river water temperature this approach leads to an improved understanding of the mechanisms by which reservoirs influence thermal regimes dams change natural stream temperatures and water quality which in turn affect the existing aquatic populations and species composition carron and rajaram 2001 downstream changes in water temperature related to impoundment can alter the abundance of warm water versus cold water fish species thereby changing the characteristics of fish communities lessard and hayes 2003 in the yangtze river changes in temperature have affected the spawning of four major chinese carp and chinese sturgeon zhang et al 2016 changes in thermal regime produced by dams have led to declines in adult abundance of chinese sturgeon and in the breeding activity of these fish huang and wang 2018 optimization of the operating rules of the tgr may be necessary to minimize negative impacts of thermal regime changes on the river ecosystem and the modeling approach presented here can contribute to this goal 6 conclusions this study has reconstructed water temperature in the absence of the three gorges reservoir to examine the separate impacts of natural change in air temperature and discharge versus dam construction on the water temperature of the middle reach of the yangtze river following impoundment the results reveal that the tgr has had a greater impact on water temperature than natural changes in air temperature and discharge however factors not explicitly accounted for by the model β0 have produced the greatest warming effect greater than the effects of the tgr or of changes in air temperature and discharge the reservoir acts as a source of cold water in spring summer and autumn and a warm source in winter the enhanced impacts of tgr as the operation stage of tgr was completed confirm that changes of water temperature can be attributed primarily to the tgr by reliably identifying the independent influence of the tgr on water temperature this study provides useful information on the extent to which the reservoir has altered an important characteristic of the river ecosystem the information can also be used to assess the long term impact of the tgr on thermal regime and to guide river conservation planning

5769,the flow sediment and temperature regimes of the yangtze river have changed greatly due to the construction of the three gorges reservoir tgr although past work has focused mainly on the influence of the tgr on water and sediment regimes less attention has been given to temperature effects water temperature changes have important implications for the quality of aquatic habitat and the health of the river ecosystem this study investigates the impact of the tgr on the water temperature regime along the middle reach of the yangtze river to accurately quantify the impact of tgr on water temperature a regression modeling framework is employed to reconstruct the temporal pattern of flow and temperature variation along the middle reach of the river in the absence of the tgr based on this modeling reconstructed water temperatures are compared to observed water temperature for the post impounded period period 2003 2014 to estimate the influence of impoundment on water temperature results show that the influence of the tgr on water temperature alteration exceeds the influence of natural factors the effect of tgr relative to unimpounded conditions is to reduce water temperatures in the spring summer and autumn and to increase water temperatures in the winter the results of this study illustrate the pronounced effect of the tgr on the temperature regime of the yangtze river and provide information that can help guide operation of three gorges reservoir to enhance biological conservation keywords water temperature three gorges reservoir reconstruction

ding et al 2015 large dams can influence temperature regimes of rivers by impounding water for prolonged periods reservoirs in temperate regions often stratify in response to changing atmospheric conditions through heat transfer at the surface and internal thermodynamics elçi 2008 stratification results in a warm surface epilimnetic layer and a cool bottom hypolimnetic layer in view of the development of epilimnetic and hypolimnetic layers in reservoirs which may have different thermal characteristics than the flowing river upstream of a reservoir the impact of reservoirs on downstream

thermal changes on aquatic habitat temperature in a stream is the product of heat energy exchange between the stream and its environment including the atmosphere and the riverbed risley et al 2010 air temperature is commonly used as a predictor variable for water temperature because it can be viewed as a surrogate for net changes in heat flux that affect the water surface and also because it approximates the equilibrium temperature of a water course webb et al 2003 2008 alternative modeling approaches used to investigate air water temperature relationships include linear and nonlinear

between discharge and water temperature remains poorly understood a critical need exists to determine how air temperature and discharge influence the water temperature of rivers three gorges reservoir tgr the largest water control project in the world provides numerous benefits that contribute to economic prosperity and social well being on the other hand the tgr has substantially altered the

include a lag effect for air temperature reflects the tendency for water temperature variations to be delayed relative to air temperature fluctuations at daily time scales erickson and stefan 2000 webb et al 2003 the root mean squared error rmse is used to evaluate how well the regression model fits the data 2 rmse y t y t 2 n where y t is the simulated value yt is the observed value and n is the sample size linear multivariate water temperature regression models were estimated for each month with different time lags based on daily air temperature and discharge table 2 a daily time scale was chosen because compared to monthly or seasonal time scales exploratory regression analysis based on daily data yielded the lowest rmse separate sets of monthly models were fitted to data for periods before 1983 2002 and after 2003 2014 the construction of the tgr wtsim pre tgr represents estimates of the water temperature derived from the linear water temperature regression models in the pre tgr period 1983 2002 the corresponding coefficients of these models are β0 pre tgr β1 pre tgr and β2 pre tgr similarly values of wtsim post tgr are post tgr estimates of water temperature associated with coefficients β0 post tgr β1 post tgr and β2 post tgr the optimal time lag was determined by varying the lag and selecting the value that produced the lowest rmse the second step in the methodology involves reconstructing what the natural variation in discharge at yichang station would have been since 2003 in the absence of the tgr this step in the analysis is necessary so that the influence of discharge on water temperature in the post impoundment period 2003 2013 in the absence of impoundment can be estimated to accomplish this task a general regression neural network grnn model was generated using discharge data for cuntan and wulong hydrological stations which represent inflows of the tgr and are major components of discharge at yichang grnn is a one pass neural network learning algorithm specht 1991 consistent with the basic principle of all neural networks grnn requires training data to train itself based on input output mapping after a trained model is developed it can be used to estimate outputs for test data the basic equation associated with grnn is 3 y i y k k x x k k x x k where yi the output or prediction y k is an activation weight x is the input and x k is the training sample the activation function k x xk is 4 k x x k e d i 2 2 σ 2 where d k x x k t x x k and σ is a spread constant optimization involves determining the value of σ that minimizes the mean square error when outputs are predicted based on the model developed for the training data to apply grnn on a daily basis a lag effect is incorporated because discharge variations at yichang tend to lag behind those at cuntan and wulong by about two days on average for model development 80 of the data prior to dam construction were used for training 1952 1991 and 20 1992 2002 were used for testing tayfur et al 2014 the performance of the grnn model is assessed using the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse 5 nse 1 t 1 n y t y t 2 t 1 n y t y 2 where y t is the simulated value yt is the observed value and y is the mean value of observed data an nse of 1 0 corresponds to a perfect match between simulated and observed values the closer nse is to 1 0 the more accurate the model is if nse 0 5 forecasting is feasible moriasi et al 2007 in step three the set of monthly regressions models for the pre dam period were used to estimate values of wt in the absence

air temperature at yichang has varied between about 16 c and 18 c a slight downward trend is evident between 1956 and 1984 whereas an upward trend occurred between 1985 and 2006 fig 3 yichang experienced an extreme hot spell and drought during the summer of 2006 wu et al 2012 followed by a slight downward trend in annual air temperature between 2007 and 2015 the annual water temperature variation at yichang generally exhibits a similar pattern to air temperature between 1956 and 1973 annual water temperature increased slightly followed by a slight decrease from 1974 to 1985 a sustained increasing trend is evident from 1986 to 2006 at an average rate of 0 04 c per year as with air temperature the maximum of water temperature occurred in 2006 the extreme drought in the summer of 2006 apparently affected both air and water temperature at yichang this similarity in air and water temperature trends verifies the close correlation between the two variables which is related to the influence of solar radiation on both water and air temperature brown 1969 moore 1967 since impoundment in 2003 the mean annual water temperature has risen from 18 04 c to 18 86 c discharge at yichang has exhibited a slow decline since 1956 annual discharge from 1956 to 2002 was 13656 m3 s decreasing to 12668 m3 s after the impoundment of tgr a reduction of 7 2 4 1 2 intra annual variation as seen in fig 4 a monthly air temperature is almost consistent before and after the construction of tgr with the differences varying from 0 19 c to 1 42 c while monthly water temperature in the heating period from march to june has decreased 0 84 c to 2 39 c after impoundment and it has warmed slightly to 17 77 c in the cooling period from september to february fig 4 b overall the water temperature at yichang became less variable after impoundment and the lowest water temperature shifted from january and february to february and march river discharge changes greatly at intra annual time scales because 56 of the storage capacity of the three gorges reservoir is used for regulation of water discharges vary in conjunction with the schedule of regulated releases of water discharges in april may and december between 2003 and 2014 the period of impoundment are nearly the same as those before impoundment fig 4 c from june to november post impoundment discharges have decreased compared to mean monthly discharges from 1956 to 2002 during every flood season from mid june to late september the reservoir is operated to impound floodwaters and control the discharged flow zheng 2016 after the flood season early october tgr impounds water to increase the reservoir water level gradually to a surface elevation of 175 m during the low water season from january to march tgr releases water to sustain power generation and navigation in the reservoir area thus the mean monthly discharge has increased to 5195 m3 s 5597 m3 s higher than pre tgr period 4 2 performance of regression models values of rmse for linear regression models for each month in the pre tgr period range from 0 71 c to 1 21 c table 2 regression models for the post tgr period also perform well with rmse ranging from 0 71 c to 1 67 c the optimal time lags between water temperature and air temperature range from 2 to 30 days the lag days for may and november are equal to 30 indicating that the relations between the water temperatures of virtually all days in those months are strongly influenced by air temperatures from the preceding month the average optimal lag is slightly longer 14 days for the post dam set of models than for the pre dam set of models 8 days table 2 consistent with the previous study that water temperature responded more slowly to air temperature specifically after dam construction kędra and wiejaczka 2016 predicted patterns of water temperature over the year for both pre and post impoundment match closely the observed pattern fig 5 consistent with the lack of model bias ε 0 optimization of the grnn model yielded a nondimensional spread value σ of 0 03 nse value for discharge reached 0 89 higher than the satisfactory level of 0 5 and the model performance could be described as very good moriasi et al 2007 the result indicates the model accurately represents variation in the natural discharge at yichang without the effects of impoundment as expected the model predicts that since 2003 peak discharges would be greater and minimum discharges would be less than observed values of discharge if the flow was not regulated by the tgr fig 6 to evaluate uncertainties that may be propagated to reconstructed water temperatures based on the use of simulated discharges data for the pre dam period 1983 2002 were divided into subsets for training 1983 1996 and testing 1997 2002 periods models fitted to data for the training period were then used to estimate water temperatures for the testing period based on predicted discharges and data on air temperature reconstructed water temperatures for the testing period 1997 2002 were then compared to corresponding observed water temperatures relative errors in predicted monthly averaged water temperatures ranged from 8 3 1 6 with an average of 3 5 the nse for the testing period was 0 99 with an rmse of only 0 68 c these results indicate that reconstruction of water temperature using simulated discharges is highly accurate and that uncertainties associated with this method have little effect on subsequent analysis 4 3 assessing the impact of tgr on water temperature the sets of linear water temperature regression models combined with the prediction of discharge in the absence of tgr at yichang in 2003 2013 using the grnn model provides the basis for accurately quantifying the separate contributions of natural changes versus reservoir related changes on water temperature at yichang after the tgr seasonal and annual statistics were generated using eq 7 based on the observed and simulated water temperatures table 3 results reveal that total annual change in water temperature at yichang attributable to tgr δtgr is larger than change attributable to natural factors δnc overall the annual water temperature has increased by 0 67 c since impoundment of this total change only 0 16 c of warming is attributable to natural changes in air temperature and discharge δnc on the other hand reservoir operation has independently decreased water temperature by 0 65 c δtgr other factors not explicitly accounted for by the model δβ0 have produced the greatest change resulting in warming of 1 16 c the results also show that the relative impact of the tgr on water temperature varies seasonally seasonal impacts of tgr differ significantly p value 0 01 from those of natural factors based on a student s t test absolute differences of changes in water temperature attributable to tgr are 2 78 16 83 times those attributable to natural factors during relatively warm parts of the year march to november the tgr has a cooling effect ranging from 0 57 c to 1 29 c on water temperature this effect is consistent with release of water stored within the reservoir that because of the high thermal inertia of the stored water is cooler than expected based on air temperature similarly during the winter december to february the tgr has a slight warming effect 0 22 c perhaps reflecting the release of slightly warmer reservoir water compared to the water temperature that would occur if this temperature was strongly controlled by air temperature cai et al 2018 the cooling effect is greatest in the spring march to may 1 29 c and during this season the release of cool water from the tgr has had the greater impact on water temperature relative to natural changes in air temperature or discharge other factors reflected in δβ0 have led to a significant warming of water temperature in autumn and winter using eq 10 the contributions of changes in air water temperature interaction and of changes in discharge to changes in water temperature can be determined the construction of tgr has resulted in substantial changes in nearby land use land cover topography and evaporation wu et al 2012 which has in turn affected the sensitivity of water temperature to air temperature erickson and stefan 2000 langan et al 2001 webb et al 2008 moreover water storage within the tgr and thermal inertia associated with storage also affect the relationship between air temperature and water temperature as shown in table 4 changes in air water temperature interaction following the construction of the tgr have a cooling effect ranging from 0 26 c to 0 94 c in all four seasons the largest decrease 2 1 c occur in august when the water in the river should be quite warm tgr regulates the amount and timing of water releases for flood prevention power generation and navigation throughout the year which can change the relationship between water temperature and discharge especially given thermal inertia effects of stored water the results indicate that the altered pattern of discharge exerted different effects on water temperature in the four seasons a cooling effect in spring and autumn and a warming effect in summer and winter in march the changed pattern of flow has its maximum independent effect on water temperature producing cooling of 3 54 c compared to the independent effect of predicted unregulated discharges at this time of year flow within the river may normally be warming but thermal inertial of relatively cool reservoir water may promote cooling tgr experienced three operation stages which may contribute to impacts on water temperature at yichang through changes in the water volume stored in the reservoir and hence in its thermal inertia cai et al 2018 in june 2003 the water level of the tgr was raised to an elevation of 135 m and power generation began with the water being retained by a cofferdam the water level fluctuated seasonally between 136 and 143 m until 2006 initial stage from october 2006 to october 2008 transitional stage the water level rose to between 145 and 156 m and preliminary operations began by november 2008 standard normal stage the level of the reservoir reached its normal level of 175 m contributions related to tgr vary during different operational stages table 5 the results for standard normal stage are roughly consistent with effects throughout the period from 2003 to 2014 the cooling effect of tgr became enhanced in summer as the stage increased while warming trends developed in autumn and winter as the water level in the reservoir rose the clear variations in δtgr during different operation stages of tgr reinforce the assumption that tgr brought about significant impacts on water temperature behavior at yichang 5 discussion the framework developed and implemented in this study provides an improved method for determining the effects of natural factors versus reservoir impoundment on water temperature specifically it isolates the separate contributions of natural factors versus impoundment using a water temperature regression model that captures the changes induced by varying external conditions this research has refined the analysis of the effects of dams on water temperature variations by accounting for factors other than the presence of the dam that could produce differences in water temperature characteristics before and after impoundment besides air temperature and discharge other factors such as sewage discharges land use changes and industrial pollution can influence water temperature cai et al 2018 these other influences are accounted for in the modeling by changes in the coefficient β0 the findings of this study reveal that these other factors have had the most important influence on water temperature in the river below the tgr which needs further work to identify the way in which these factors influence water temperature however the effect of the tgr exceeds the effect related to natural factors with the tgr producing net cooling during all but the coldest parts of the year past studies have revealed that reservoirs can substantially change hydrological and thermal regimes downstream and that this impact can extend for tens to hundreds of kilometers petts 1986 richter et al 1998 soja and wiejaczka 2014 this study confirms that the construction of the tgr has had an important independent effect on the water temperature regime of the yangtze river downstream of the tgr consistent with previous findings the findings are also consistent with results of previous work indicating that natural synchronization between air temperature and water temperature has changed since initiation of reservoir operation kedra and wiejaczka 2018 the analysis in this study supports the conclusion that the interaction between air temperature and water temperature has weakened following dam construction past work has not considered explicitly the linkage between water temperature and discharge whereas the findings of this study show that the connection between discharge and water temperature is also affected by the operation of the tgr it may be feasible to produce river water temperatures sufficiently close to natural temperatures using adaptive management strategies designed to restore environmental river flows gu et al 1999 richter and thomas 2007 for that purpose monitoring river flow and air temperature downstream of dams and quantifying the respective contributions of these factors to thermal regime are necessary to facilitate modeling of future scenarios based on modification of reservoir outflows different from other statistical methods for water temperature reconstruction that seek to quantify the separate contributions of climate and human interventions e g air2stream model this study has used a linear regression model to isolate the effects of changes in air water temperature interaction and the pattern of discharge produced by dam construction on the river water temperature this approach leads to an improved understanding of the mechanisms by which reservoirs influence thermal regimes dams change natural stream temperatures and water quality which in turn affect the existing aquatic populations and species composition carron and rajaram 2001 downstream changes in water temperature related to impoundment can alter the abundance of warm water versus cold water fish species thereby changing the characteristics of fish communities lessard and hayes 2003 in the yangtze river changes in temperature have affected the spawning of four major chinese carp and chinese sturgeon zhang et al 2016 changes in thermal regime produced by dams have led to declines in adult abundance of chinese sturgeon and in the breeding activity of these fish huang and wang 2018 optimization of the operating rules of the tgr may be necessary to minimize negative impacts of thermal regime changes on the river ecosystem and the modeling approach presented here can contribute to this goal 6 conclusions this study has reconstructed water temperature in the absence of the three gorges reservoir to examine the separate impacts of natural change in air temperature and discharge versus dam construction on the water temperature of the middle reach of the yangtze river following impoundment the results reveal that the tgr has had a greater impact on water temperature than natural changes in air temperature and discharge however factors not explicitly accounted for by the model β0 have produced the greatest warming effect greater than the effects of the tgr or of changes in air temperature and discharge the reservoir acts as a source of cold water in spring summer and autumn and a warm source in winter the enhanced impacts of tgr as the operation stage of tgr was completed confirm that changes of water temperature can be attributed primarily to the tgr by reliably identifying the independent influence of the tgr on water temperature this study provides useful information on the extent to which the reservoir has altered an important characteristic of the river ecosystem the information can also be used to assess the long term impact of the tgr on thermal regime and to guide river conservation planning
