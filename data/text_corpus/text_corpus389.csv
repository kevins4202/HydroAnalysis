1945,design flood values give estimates of flood magnitude within a given return period and are essential to making adaptive decisions around land use planning infrastructure design and disaster mitigation many hydrologic applications where flood retention is important e g floodplain management and reservoir design need design flood values for different durations flood duration frequency qdf models extend the standard statistical flood frequency analysis framework to multiple flood durations and are analogous to intensity duration frequency models for precipitation implementations of qdf models commonly assume simple scaling where only the magnitude of the index flood is assumed to change with duration despite empirical analyses showing a more complex dependence structure we propose a multiscaling extension to existing qdf models where the magnitude of the index flood and the slope of the growth curve may scale independently with duration in an application to 12 locations in norway we assess how three different qdf models capture relationships between floods of different duration incorporating duration dependency independently in both the index flood and the growth curve extended qdf model improves modeling of both short duration events and events with long return periods this model extension further expands the models ability to simultaneously model a wide range of durations as measured by the integrated quadratic distance the extended qdf model performs better than the original qdf model in 83 of the out of sample subdaily durations studied additionally we find that the choice of durations used to fit qdf models is a highly influential aspect of the modeling process keywords flood frequency analysis design flood level flood duration frequency models generalized extreme value distribution bayesian statistics data availability the flood and hydrological data were extracted from the national hydrological database hydra ii hosted by the norwegian water resources and energy directorate nve the 12 stations used in this analysis are published at https doi org 10 5281 zenodo 7085557 1 introduction floods are a widespread and costly threat to society worldwide their destructive capacity is likely to increase in the near future due to a rise in both the prevalence of floods under climate change and an increase in the economic value of flood prone areas alfieri et al 2017 field et al 2012 estimation of design floods is an important aspect of societal adaptation to increased flood risk such estimation can be undertaken in one of three general ways e g filipova et al 2019 1 statistical flood frequency analysis ffa where observed historical flood events are used to estimate the magnitude of flood events with a certain return period 2 event based hydrological modeling for a single design event where design rainfall or other single realizations of initial conditions and precipitation are used as input to a hydrological model that simulates the desired flood event and 3 derived flood frequency methods which use weather generators coupled with hydrologic models to simulate long series of synthetic discharge that can be used to statistically estimate the desired return periods the first approach statistical ffa is the focus of this paper flood duration frequency qdf models extend the standard statistical ffa framework to multiple flood durations and are analogous to intensity duration frequency idf models for precipitation many hydrologic applications where flood retention is important e g floodplain management and reservoir design need flood estimates for different durations typically the annual maxima used in qdf modeling are sampled from discharge series averaged over different durations javelle et al 2002 cunderlik and ouarda 2006 this means that the duration d represents the total flow volume for a time span of d hours not flood events that lasted precisely d hours this aggregation based approach to obtaining annual maxima means qdf models provide an accessible way to get relationships between total flow volumes and durations for applications where the total volume of water is of interest in the qdf approach an extreme value distribution usually the generalized extreme value or gev distribution is fit to annual maxima from different durations then the relationship between the durations and the fitted distributions is described by the qdf model this allows for the quantiles of the distribution to be parametrically expressed as a continuous formulation of both return period and duration where consistency between the quantiles of the distribution at different durations is enforced by the qdf model javelle et al 2002 in practice this means that for example the t year flood for the mean daily streamflow time series will never report a higher return level than the t year flood for the instantaneous streamflow time series where t describes the return period of the flood such consistency is not guaranteed when estimating extreme value distributions individually for several fixed durations and remains one of the main benefits of qdf modeling in situations where the return level at several durations is of interest in addition the parametric nature of the qdf model allows for extrapolation to unobserved durations and establishes the potential for prediction in ungauged basins javelle et al 2002 the foundations of qdf modeling were developed in the 1990s through analysis of the relationships between n day flood volumes as explored in balocki and burges 1994 and sherwood 1994 the original qdf model is generally attributed to javelle et al 1999 qdf modeling has found most of its application in france canada and britain in the early 2000s javelle et al 2002 2003 zaidman et al 2003 although it has been applied a handful of times in the decades since cunderlik et al 2007 crochet 2012 onyutha and willems 2015 in a guide to hydrological practices the world meteorological organization 2009 notes that qdf analysis remains under utilized despite its strong potential in more recent years the qdf model has been used to characterize flood events of different duration in algeria renima et al 2018 to inform development of a depth duration frequency relationship used to assess risk of rainfall driven floods in poland markiewicz 2021 and as a comparison point to idf models when assessing catchment behavior for runoff extremes in austria breinl et al 2021 as noted in breinl et al 2021 the relationship quantified by the qdf model is an analogue to the relationship quantified in idf modeling for precipitation extremes in the hypothetical situation where all rainfall becomes runoff and the time of concentration is instantaneous the qdf and idf models have identical relationships available qdf models usually assume that only the index flood changes with duration with the growth curve assumed constant across durations e g javelle et al 2002 cunderlik and ouarda 2006 breinl et al 2021 here the index flood is the median annual maximum flood the growth curve is a scaled version of the flood frequency curve created by taking the ratio of the flood of any frequency to the index flood robson and reed 1999 the multiplication of the growth curve and the index flood gives the flood frequency curve we find it useful to discuss the flood frequency curve in terms of index floods and growth curves for a few reasons first it clarifies the discussion around an established problem with qdf models second the concept of the flood frequency curve as an index flood and a growth curve fits with the reparameterization introduced in section 3 third this language and reparameterization of the flood frequency curve aligns with regionalization methods note that growth curves are presented in dalrymple 1960 as basic dimensionless frequency curves allowing for cross catchment comparisons this assumption of constant growth curve across durations contradicts empirical analyses of runoff scaling properties in norway that show the ratio between peak and daily floods may be dependent on return period engeland et al 2020 sælthun et al 1997 multiscaling models that allow for this behavior that is models that allow for the ratio between growth curves of different durations to be dependent on return period already exist in the idf literature van de vyver 2018 courty et al 2019 fauer et al 2021 however in all existing models the different scaling components are placed on the location and the scale parameter of the gev distribution respectively this hinders a direct interpretation in terms of scaling of the index flood on the one hand and the growth curve on the other hand here we propose a multiscaling extension of the qdf model of javelle et al 2002 where the magnitude of the index flood and the slope of the growth curve may scale independently with duration the natural sparsity of available extreme value data means parameter estimation is in general challenging for extreme value models scarrott and macdonald 2012 the additional parameters introduced by multiscaling models compound these challenges fauer et al 2021 we introduce an alternative parameterization of what we call the characteristic duration parameters that allows for more numerical stability in addition we adopt a bayesian estimation approach that allows for all parameters to be estimated concurrently bayesian estimation of idf models is well established and provides advantages such as accessible uncertainty assessments scaling to regional models via hierarchical bayesian approaches and the ability to add information through prior distributions have been shown to be relevant cheng and aghakouchak 2014 huard et al 2010 current qdf models are typically estimated in a two step procedure where the characteristic duration parameter is estimated first followed by an estimation of the remaining parameters javelle et al 2002 cunderlik et al 2007 however such two step estimation does not typically provide uncertainty information is difficult to use with multiscaling models and moreover requires additional assumptions if the model is to be used in a regional context cunderlik and ouarda 2006 design flood estimation is often most concerned with estimation of peak discharge in this case a statistical estimation poses a challenge since flood series of length appropriate for statistical ffa often contain segments at a daily or coarser time resolution this is dealt with in practice as a data quality issue most national guidelines for ffa outline detailed data quality control steps and recommend application of ffa only when fine resolution time series of suitable length exist or when catchment properties are such that daily data can be trusted to provide a representative profile of the flood peak ball et al 2019 england et al 2019 castellarin et al 2012 in the situation where we have neither fine resolution time series nor catchment properties that allow for construction of the flood peak from daily data there exist methodologies for scaling daily data to approximate the instantaneous peak flow ding et al 2015 fill and steiner 2003 in norway scaling between daily and instantaneous peak flows is performed by establishing a relationship between the daily flows and the instantaneous peak flows for the largest floods in the catchment in the case where no data is available the relationship can be provided by a hydrologically similar catchment wilson et al 2011 notes the uncertainty in this method is likely to be large and difficult to reconcile with the uncertainty inherent to ffa therefore it is of interest to investigate the skill of qdf models to predict floods at subdaily unobserved durations based on their parametric assumptions and available coarser time resolution data at the site of interest to summarize the main objective of this study is to assess how different qdf models capture relationships between floods of different duration in particular we want to answer the following questions i is there one qdf model that best captures flood behavior at the shortest sub daily durations ii what are the models abilities when estimating in sample and out of sample durations and iii how sensitive are qdf models to input durations to this aim we evaluate three different models one of which is the original qdf model as presented in javelle et al 2002 the other two models investigated are new qdf models that allow for differing degrees of duration dependency in the growth curve for comparison three parameter gev distributions are fit independently to each duration in line with the current guidelines midtømme 2011 england et al 2019 the remainder of the paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the data and describes several data artifacts unique to qdf modeling section 3 presents the three qdf models investigated in this study and details both the bayesian framework and markov chain monte carlo mcmc sampling to facilitate both interpretation and inference a quantile based reparameterization of the gev distribution is proposed section 4 describes qdf model behavior and assesses performance in relation to locally fit gev distributions the paper finishes with a discussion section 5 and conclusions section 6 2 data the flood data came from 12 streamflow stations in norway that have at least 28 years of quality controlled data with minimal influence from reservoirs and other installations that might alter the natural streamflow see engeland et al 2016 for details all streamflow data were taken from the norwegian hydrological database hydra ii hosted by the norwegian water resources and energy directorate nve the locations of the gauging stations as well as catchment areas and flood generating processes are shown in fig 1 the selected stations are diverse relative to nordic catchments allowing us to evaluate the qdf models on a variety of flood behaviors see table d 7 for a listing of selected catchment properties the catchment size ranges from 6 31 km 2 gravå to 570 km 2 etna in norway the two major flood generating processes are snowmelt and rain in fig 1 this is illustrated as the average fractional rain contribution to each flood event the average rainfall contribution was estimated by calculating the ratio of rainfall to total water depth from both rainfall and snowmelt accumulated in a time window prior to each flood and then averaging these ratios over all flood events for details see engeland et al 2020 a fraction of rain value close to one means the floods at this location are primarily driven by rain a value closer to zero means snowmelt is the dominant flood generating mechanism rain was calculated from the precipitation and temperature from senorge 2 0 dataset lussana et al 2019 snow melt was extracted from the senorge snow model saloranta 2014 in our dataset the rain contribution varies from 0 32 at grosettjern to 0 95 at røykenes 2 1 data quality control each of the streamflow records encompasses a variety of collection methods these differing collection methods provide data at different frequencies typically we find daily time resolution in the first part of a streamflow record and a higher frequency of measurements in the latter part of the streamflow record after adoption of digitized limnigraph records and or digital measurements it is necessary to make sure that the sampling frequency of the data is high enough to represent peak flood magnitudes with sufficient quality this is especially important at small catchments a higher frequency of measurements is needed to capture the behavior of quicker flashier floods vs slower smoother floods in the records for the smallest catchments this constraint excludes substantial parts with a daily sampling frequency for two large primarily snowmelt driven catchments etna and viskvatn we used the daily data in addition to the more high resolution data the daily data was collected beginning in 1920 for etna and in 1903 for viksvatn the high resolution data was collected from 1983 2022 for etna and from 1985 2022 for viksvatn for all the remaining stations we used data from approximately 1970 to 2022 which is collected via a combination of limnigraph and digital readings precise record lengths can be found in table d 7 the time resolution of the digital measurements and the digitization of the limnigraph records were selected by nve to be frequent enough to represent flood peaks at individual stations in addition to quality control on the sampling frequency the data have already undergone a detailed quality control by the hydrometric section at nve ice jams are an issue at many stations in norway and may influence the validity of the rating curves used to calculate streamflows from measured water levels when needed specific correction procedures as specified in internal quality assurance protocols at nve have been applied to get correct discharge any year with less than 300 days of data was discarded the final data set contains no extraordinary flood events as seen in appendix e 2 2 data processing for qdf the data set for the qdf analysis is constructed from an evenly spaced streamflow time series at the reference duration where the reference duration is the finest time resolution of interest even spacing in the reference duration is enforced via regular sampling of a linear interpolation of the observed data let x 0 τ be this time series at the reference duration a moving average of window length d was applied to x 0 τ to manufacture a new time series x d t 1 x d t 1 d t d 2 t d 2 x 0 τ d τ block maxima or peak over threshold values can then be extracted from x d t to form sets of maxima given as 2 q d 1 q d 2 q d k where in the case of annual maxima k is the number of years of data the width d used as the length of the averaging window corresponds to the duration of interest and the average in eqn 1 can be repeatedly applied under different d to manufacture new sets of maxima that correspond to different durations of interest under this aggregation approach the durations d represent the total volume of water that arrives over a time span of d hours not flood events that lasted precisely d hours these sets of maxima produced under different d are dependent that is since longer duration series are always aggregated from series of shorter duration the values in one set of maxima depend on the values in the other sets recent advances in idf have focused on use of multivariate extreme value theory models which explicitly model this dependence structure between sets of maxima jurado et al 2020 the qdf models presented in this study are simpler so called univariate extreme value theory models and do not account for this dependence structure we use fig 2 to justify the choice of the simpler model the aggregation to total flow volume over a time span of duration d described in eq 1 introduces a dependency structure that is neither predictable nor directly relatable to catchment properties fig 2 demonstrates this first annual maxima for different durations are in some cases primarily issued from the same flood event however in other cases the maxima at different durations are based on different flood events with potentially different flood generating processes in the first scenario the annual maxima have a strong dependency due to overlapping temporal support and serial correlation in the second there is weak dependency this presence or absence of this change in across duration correlation is not directly relatable to catchment properties second annual maxima are not guaranteed to decrease as the duration of the averaging window is increased and the circumstances that produce this inconsistent behavior in maxima for example two flood events of similar volume occurring within a short time period of each other or a particularly wide and flat topped flood event are also not directly relatable to catchment properties 3 methods extreme value theory allows for the estimation of extreme events by providing a framework for modeling the tail of probability distributions where such extreme events would lie let x 1 x n be a set of continuous univariate random variables that are assumed to be independent and identically distributed if the normalized distribution of the maximum max x 1 x n converges as n then it converges to a gev distribution fisher and tippett 1928 jenkinson 1955 see coles 2001 for further details in flood frequency analysis the set of values that is taken to be distributed gev is typically the set of annual maxima the gev distribution is governed by a location scale and shape parameter the special case where the shape parameter is equal to zero is termed the gumbel or two parameter distribution both distributions are used in european ffa and an overview of country specific application can be found in castellarin et al 2012 previous research castellarin et al 2012 midtømme 2011 kobierska et al 2018 recommends the three parameter gev distribution for ffa on individual norwegian stations the following qdf models are thus based in the three parameter form of the gev where the cumulative distribution function of the gev is given as 3 g z exp 1 ξ z μ σ 1 ξ which is defined on z 1 ξ z μ σ 0 with parameter bounds μ σ 0 and ξ and where z would be the observed annual maximum streamflow for duration d for a specific year the case where the shape parameter ξ is equal to zero is interpreted as the limit when ξ 0 the remainder of this section is organized as follows first a quantile based reparameterization of gev distribution is adopted then three different qdf models one established model and two newmodels are introduced under this reparameterization finally the fitting methodologies and model evaluation metrics are described 3 1 reparameterization of the gev distribution the parameters of a gev model are most easily interpreted in terms of the quantile expressions traditional descriptors such as the mean and variance are inappropriate for the skewed distribution of the gev and moreover are undefined for certain values of the ξ parameter coles 2001 we reparametrize the gev distribution using the α 0 5 quantile in line with the recent work of castro camilo et al 2022 the relationship between the location parameter μ and the location parameter under the reparameterization η i e the median flood is given as 4 η μ σ log 2 ξ 1 ξ if ξ 0 μ log log 2 if ξ 0 estimates of extreme quantiles are obtained by substituting η from eq 4 for μ in eq 3 and inverting the result giving 5 z p η σ log 1 p ξ log 2 ξ ξ here g z p 1 p and z p is the return level associated with the return period t such that t 1 p finally to reduce dependency between parameters the scale parameter is decomposed as a product of the median flood and a remainder term expressed as an exponential function e β such that the new scale parameter β is given as 6 β log σ η the location parameter η has a more reasonable interpretation under the reparameterization in eq 5 it is now the median of the gev distribution with units of m 3 s consequently it is much easier to choose informative priors under the reparameterization an important advantage in a bayesian framework gelman et al 2013 in addition to providing interpretable parameters this parameterization has the added benefit of aligning with the index flood approach popular in regional flood frequency modeling where the median flood for a group of catchments is taken as a typical or index flood dalrymple 1960 explicitly including the median as a parameter in the model means the order of magnitude of a flood can be separated from the shape and slope of the growth curve this has potential to simplify the search for regressors in a regional qdf model castro camilo et al 2022 3 2 models this section discusses three competing models first the original qdf model from javelle et al 2002 is presented under the reparameterization in section 3 1 then the new extended qdf model is introduced finally a mixture model taking components from both previous models is introduced each of these models introduces additional parameters to the classic gev model the models differ in the number of additional parameters added but can all be classified as duration dependent gev or d gev models we motivate the development of the extended multiscaling qdf model with fig 3 the leftmost panel of the figure shows several flood frequency curves estimated independently for four durations the curves for 48 and 72 h are inconsistent that is the 72 h frequency curve crosses the 48 h curve physically there should not be a larger total volume of water during a 48 h interval than a 72 h interval these inconsistencies can arise when we ignore duration dependence in both the index flood and growth curve that is when we estimate durations independently qdf models enforce consistency between flood frequency curves of different duration as the middle and right panels of fig 3 show existing qdf models account for duration dependence in the index flood but not the growth curve this is termed simple scaling and is illustrated in the middle panel of fig 3 however ignoring the effect of duration dependency on the growth curve can lead to poor estimation in the tails of the distribution models that account for duration dependency in both the index flood and growth curve are called multiscaling models the extended qdf model accounts for duration dependency in the growth curve by allowing the both the magnitude of the index flood and the slope of the growth curve to change with duration right panel fig 3 3 2 1 original qdf model the annual maxima under the original qdf model proposed in javelle et al 2002 are independently distributed 7 q d i gev η d β ξ where 8 η d η 1 d δ 1 and the quantile function under the reparameterization in section 3 1 is given as 9 z d p η 1 d δ 1 e β log 1 p ξ log 2 ξ ξ where δ 0 note the inverse of the characteristic duration parameter δ from javelle s original qdf model is used here for numerical stability during estimation a high value for δ indicates the total flow volume arrives quickly analogous to a flashy peaked hydrograph with a pronounced duration dependency for the median flood whereas a value close to zero indicates a slower timespan analogous to a wide hydrograph with minor duration dependency for the floods the traditional flood frequency curve that is a gev distribution fit to an instantaneous time series is recovered in the limit of the aggregation window as d 0 in javelle s model only η is dependent on d and δ this aligns with the literature base for idf modeling in the sense that the model can be written as a separable function of d and p notice further that if the 1 d δ quantity in eq 9 was replaced with a power relationship the model would match that of the idf models summarized in koutsoyiannis et al 1998 the power relationship and separable functional dependence of the idf model has its roots in stochastic process theory although the model as typically applied does not rely on this theory base since idf models do not attempt to make explicit mathematical statements about how the higher order moments e g variance change with duration koutsoyiannis et al 1998 since only the magnitude of the median flood η is duration dependent in the model in eq 9 the underlying assumption of the original qdf model is that the slope of the growth curve does not change with duration 3 2 2 extended qdf model the extended qdf model referred to as the double delta qdf model is structured to be able to capture differences in slope of the growth curves coming from peak and daily values or indeed values coming from any two different aggregation intervals changing the steepness of the growth curve dependent on duration requires extra flexibility in the tail behavior of the model so the model allows η and β to depend on the aggregation interval d and additional parameters δ 1 and δ 2 respectively the ξ parameter is kept duration invariant due to the difficulties in estimating the ξ parameter stemming from the involved parametric form of the cdf eq 3 under double delta the annual maxima are independently distributed as 10 q d i gev η d β d ξ where 11 η d η 1 d δ 1 1 12 β d log σ η d 1 d δ 2 and the distribution s quantiles for a duration d corresponding to exceedance probability p are given by 13 z d p η 1 d δ 1 1 e β 1 d δ 2 log 1 p ξ log 2 ξ ξ with constraint 14 0 δ 2 δ 1 the constraint on the delta parameters reflects the fact that the data aggregation performed in qdf modeling see section 2 2 is more likely to have a larger effect on the flood magnitude than on the decomposed scale parameter recall that the value of the δ 1 parameter reflects the flashiness of the floods measured a narrow hydrograph will be associated with larger values of δ 1 the δ 2 parameter does not have an equally accessible hydrologic interpretation but can be interpreted as a measure of difference in growth curve slope across aggregation intervals that is if the ratio between peak and daily floods is heavily dependent on return period we would expect to see larger values of δ 2 as the aggregation window shrinks to zero that is as d 0 the double delta model is equivalent to the standard gev model that creates the traditional flood frequency curve similarly as δ 2 0 the double delta model approaches javelle s qdf model double delta can thus be considered an extension of javelle in the same way javelle is an extension of the traditional flood frequency curve 3 2 3 mixture model the mixture model is proposed in an attempt to access the flexibility of the double delta model without adding unnecessary complexity the model is a weighted average of the double delta and javelle models such that the density of the annual maxima is given by 15 j 1 2 m j g θ j where m j is the weight on the component model g is the density of the gev distribution θ 1 η d dd β d dd ξ dd and θ 2 η d j β j ξ j here the superscripts on the parameter sets denote the double delta and javelle models respectively using bayesian methodologies and the reversible jump algorithm detailed in section 3 3 parameter estimation and selection can be carried out simultaneously and the δ 2 parameter is only added if merited thus eq 15 is a representation of a non standard density from which it is possible to obtain quantile estimates that are an average over the distributions given by the double delta model in eq 10 and the javelle model in eq 7 3 3 bayesian framework for the javelle and double delta models bayesian inference is performed using a metropolis within gibbs algorithm robert and casella 2004 that is samples from the conditional distribution of the parameters θ 1 and θ 2 respectively are obtained by iterative sampling from the full conditional distributions of the individual parameters so that each component of the model is updated in turn prior distributions for the individual parameters assume independence the prior on η which has units of m 3 s is a diffuse truncated normal distribution truncnormal 40 100 with lower bound at zero the prior on β is a diffuse normal 0 100 for ξ we follow the methodology in martins and stedinger 2000 and use a shifted beta 6 9 distribution on the interval 0 5 0 5 the prior for δ 1 in the double delta model which is equivalent to the prior for δ in the javelle model is a lognormal 0 5 the same values are used in the prior for δ 2 which uses a truncated lognormal where the lower bound of the prior is given by δ 1 the conditional distribution of the mixture model is given by 16 p m θ q p m p θ m g q θ m where p is the generic conditional distribution consistent with this joint specification and m dd j θ θ 1 θ 2 and q q d i i 1 d 1 i k d n where k is the number of years of data and n is the total number of durations the models have equal prior probability with p m j p m d d 0 5 simplification of eq 16 considering the model without the model specification and separate parameter sets gives the conditional distributions of double delta and javelle moving between models changes the dimension of θ to account for this we employ a reversible jump mcmc algorithm similar to the reversible jump methodology for normal mixtures described in richardson and green 1997 the reversible jump mcmc proceeds as follows 1 updating θ a if m dd update η dd else update η j b if m dd update β dd else update β j c if m dd update ξ dd else update ξ j d if m dd update δ 1 and δ 2 parameters in sequence else update δ 2 splitting one delta into two or combining two deltas into one step 1 is repeated 10 times under the same model before step 2 proposal to jump between models is taken repeating step 1 for either the javelle or double delta model details the mcmc algorithm used to fit the respective model to move from double delta to javelle we need to merge δ 1 and δ 2 into one δ the combine proposal is deterministic and given by 17 δ δ 1 δ 2 the reverse split proposal going from javelle to double delta involves one degree of freedom so we generate a random variable u such that 18 u b e t a 5 1 which is then used to set 19 δ 1 u δ δ 2 1 u δ for this split move the acceptance probability is min 1 a where 20 a p m θ q p m θ q q u j where q u is the density function of u and j is the jacobian of the transformation described in eq 19 the acceptance probability for the corresponding combine move is min 1 a 1 but with substitutions that adhere to the proposal in eq 17 3 3 1 posterior return levels the markov chains detailed above return a collection of r samples 21 θ r r 1 r where r is the total number of iterations in the mcmc with a suitable number of burn in samples removed under the mixture model θ can be either θ 1 or θ 2 dependent on iteration r while posterior samples under double delta or javelle will return only θ 1 or θ 2 respectively this markov sample of the parameter set directly yields by using the quantile function in either 9 or 13 a sample of quantiles 22 z d p 1 z d p r this sample approximates the posterior distribution of the p th return level at duration d from this sample it is possible to derive approximations for the posterior mean and its credible intervals 3 4 evaluation methods to assess the models we compare qdf model output to gev distributions fit locally to each duration comparison is quantified first through the proper evaluation metric integrated quadratic distance iqd thorarinsdottir et al 2013 further since the iqd is a measure of overall distributional similarity and is not always sensitive to small differences in tail behavior we calculate the mean absolute percentage error mape for select high quantiles the iqd measures the similarity between two distributions by integrating over the squared distance between the distribution functions let g be the distribution function defined by the local gev fit and g qdf be the distribution function defined by the qdf model at the corresponding duration in practice we approximate g and g qdf by the empirical cdf of a sample from the posterior the distance between g and g qdf as measured by the iqd is then given by 23 iqd g z g qdf z 2 d z where lower values of the iqd indicate better overall performance the iqd is the score divergence associated with the well known proper scoring rule the continuous ranked probability score crps the main difference between iqd and crps is that crps calculates the integrated squared distance between a distribution and a scalar observation specified by a heaviside step function whereas iqd calculates the integrated squared distance between two distributions the mape provides a measure of similarity as the percent difference between the local gev fit and the qdf model let z d p qdf be the return level at probability p for the qdf model evaluated at duration d generated from the approximation to the posterior given in eq 22 similarly let z p gev d be the return level at probability p for the local gev fit to data at duration d then the mape is given by 24 mape 1 n i 1 n z p gev d z d p qdf z p gev d 100 where n is the number of stations at which we wish to calculate the mape 4 results we evaluate three models the original qdf model javelle the extended qdf model double delta and the mixture model we first assess how well the models capture flood behavior for in sample durations at a variety of catchments then we evaluate which of the models is most effective at predicting out of sample durations specifically short less than 24 h durations from long durations greater than or equal to 24 h finally we compare the models estimation abilities at in and out of sample durations model evaluation is carried out by comparing the qdf models to a collection of gev models fit individually to each duration the iqd is used to assess model behavior across all quantiles since it has low tail sensitivity it best captures model behavior where the bulk of our observations lie i e return periods for which we have observed data we turn to the mape to assess tail behavior where both the qdf model and the reference model are extrapolated beyond the range of observed data 4 1 model sensitivity to input durations the qdf models should be fit with the minimum number of durations needed to ensure converge of the mcmc sampler feeding too many sets of dependent data into the model can bias return level estimates and artificially narrow the credible intervals the bias is especially prevalent when the data is generated by aggregating over a longer time span and the goal is to predict short duration events to test this the models were fit under three different sets of data two durations 24 and 36 h four durations 24 36 48 72 h and six durations 24 36 48 72 96 120 h for the two duration set the mcmc sampler failed to converge results from the other two sets 24 72 and 24 120 are displayed in fig 4 the 24 120 set provides a comparatively worse fit the 90 credible interval for the this set fails to capture the locally fit gev models dashed gray lines for the 24 and 1 h durations and the return levels are also underestimated to a greater extent than in the 24 72 set this behavior is replicated across all three models and all twelve catchments results not shown 4 2 model performance on in sample durations here we present results where the three qdf models are compared against locally fit gev models at every in sample duration where the in sample durations are 1 24 48 and 72 h such an in sample comparison is useful for identifying specific scenarios where qdf models struggle to fit the data rather than strict model to model rankings since models with more parameters have an in sample advantage double delta is expected to perform better than either javelle or the mixture model return level plots displaying the qdf model output and the reference model at these four in sample durations are displayed in figs e 12 e 15 4 2 1 assessing model behavior using iqd a comparison of in sample iqd scores across stations durations and methods is given in fig 5 the scores are relatively similar across models most points fall on or along the diagonals in the two plots in fig 5 as expected the scores exhibit a slight preference towards the double delta model which has the lowest average iqd score at 0 034 highest distributional similarity to the reference model when all durations and stations are considered the mixture model has the next lowest score at 0 037 and javelle has the highest score at 0 040 the analysis shows duration specific preferences between models the double delta model has a better average iqd score than either javelle or the mixture model at every in sample duration where the average is taken over all 12 stations considered in the study however double delta s advantage is strongest at the shortest durations table 1 reports the number of stations at which double delta outperforms a comparison qdf model at each duration despite qdf models showing an overall good performance there are certain stations where each of the three qdf models differs substantially from the reference model this behavior is particularly prevalent for the 1 and 24 h durations at hugdal bru displayed in panel a of fig 6 we suspect the issues with the shorter durations at hugdal bru represent a conflict between the parameter constraints inherent in the qdf models and the runoff generating processes for sub daily streamflow at this particular station hugdal bru is heavily snowmelt driven with a strong diurnal melt pattern the data averaging used in qdf modeling smooths out this sub daily variation but this relatively large reduction in variance is not reflected in the parameter constraints of the qdf model since the primary scaling occurs on the median flood a constraint described in eq 14 thus the behavior of 1 h floods with return period under 5 years is difficult for the qdf models to fit floods with higher return periods tend to come from larger precipitation or melting events that supersede the diurnal cycle and as such have a more regular relationship between durations durations above 24 h without the diurnal cycle also have a more regular relationship between durations the qdf models assume a constant shape parameter across all durations included in the analysis as shown in panel b of fig 6 this assumption may lead to estimates that diverge from local duration independent estimates where the latter analysis yields substantially varying shape parameter estimates across the durations here the individually fit gev models have shape parameters ranging from 0 140 for the 1 h duration to 0 037 for the 72 h duration the qdf models do not have duration dependence built into the shape parameter and as such must choose one shape parameter for the entire set in this case 0 018 for double delta 0 021 for the mixture model and 0 036 for javelle this inflexibility of the shape parameter is a known limitation of qdf models but is not easily solved as this parameter faces estimation difficulties due to the involved parametric form of the cumulative distribution function of the gev as a result the qdf models tend to underestimate high quantiles for short durations and overestimate high quantiles for longer durations specifically for gryta using javelle the 1 h duration is underestimated and the 48 and 72 h durations are both overestimated to a greater extent than we see in the double delta model 4 2 2 assessing model behavior using mape the within sample mape was computed for the 100 year and 1000 year flood events 0 99 and 0 999 quantiles these quantiles lie beyond the observed range of data for most of the stations and thus require extrapolation of both the qdf models and the reference model the double delta model has the lowest mape at both return periods when all in sample durations and stations are taken into account 5 9 error at the 100 year return period and 10 0 error at the 1000 year return period the mixture model has the next lowest mape with 6 5 error at the 100 year return period and 12 1 error at the 1000 year return period the javelle model has the highest mape with 7 7 error at the 100 year return period and 12 1 error at the 1000 year return period as with the iqd the advantage of double delta is strongest at the shortest durations table 2 reports the number of stations at which double delta outperforms either javelle or the mixture model the addition of the second delta parameter has the most impact when estimating events with long return periods we see this in the differences in behavior of the model to model comparisons between the iqd and mape figs 5 and 7 javelle and the mixture model appear more similar when evaluated by the iqd than they do under the mape that is using the iqd score the two models have about the same amount of clustering around the diagonal when compared to double delta but using mape which measures differences in tail behavior between the qdf models and reference model we see a difference between javelle and mixture model when compared to double delta the values for the mixture model are much more closely clustered around the diagonal in fig 7 than the values for javelle these stations that show an improvement in mape under the mixture model are those that have a high weight on the second delta parameter one of the stations that is most improved by the addition of the second delta is gryta marked by gray squares in fig 7 the return level plots in panel b of fig 6 show this station in particular benefits from the adjustment of growth curve slope afforded by the second delta the second delta somewhat mitigates the effect of the assumption of a constant shape parameter across durations however even with this adjustment in growth curve slope both double delta and the mixture model have high error values for the 1 h duration at gryta around 20 30 4 3 model performance on out of sample durations here the models were fit with four durations 24 36 48 and 60 h and the resulting parameter estimates were used to predict the 1 and 12 h durations the qdf predictions were compared to locally fit gev models using both the iqd and mape return level plots showing the reference and qdf models at both out of sample durations are displayed in figs f 16 f 19 double delta has the best average iqd score on the out of sample durations reporting a score of 0 34 while the mixture model reports a score of 0 42 and javelle reports 0 44 fig 8 shows a model to model comparison on the out of sample durations there are only three station and duration combinations both the 1 and 12 h durations at sjodalsvatn and the 1 h duration at dyrdalsvatn and øyungen where double delta performs worse as measured by the iqd than the other two models these stations are outlined in red in fig 8 at every other station and duration double delta performs the same or better all three qdf models provide a poor distributional fit for the sub daily durations at hugdal bru and the 1 h duration at røykenes these stations are labeled by name in fig 8 difficulties fitting the sub daily durations of hugdal bru are discussed in section 4 2 1 the 1 h duration at røykenes exhibits a large change in shape parameter with an increase in duration like the station gryta shown in panel b of fig 6 double delta has the best average mape score on the out of sample durations 11 1 error at the 100 year return period and 15 4 error at the 1000 year return period the mixture model has the next lowest mape with 12 2 error at the 100 year return period and 16 9 error at the 1000 year return period the javelle model has the highest mape with 12 8 error at the 100 year return period and 17 4 error at the 1000 year return period double delta provides an equal or better fit at around 80 of the stations and durations at both return periods stations and durations where double delta is outperformed by either javelle or the mixture model are outlined in red in fig 9 several of the smallest catchments gravå gryta and grosettjern have high out of sample mape values these three catchments have some of the highest variation in the shape and slope of the individually fit gev models see tables a 3 and b 5 where the β parameter is taken as a proxy for slope a highly duration dependent shape parameter is a known challenge for qdf models see the scenario in panel b of fig 6 and we would expect the qdf models to struggle to find a shape parameter value that approximates both the longest and shortest durations even when these durations are in sample furthermore not only do we observe a large shape parameter range but this range crosses zero for both gryta and grosettjern with the longer durations having a negative shape parameter while the shorter durations have a positive shape parameter this is a substantial difference a negative shape parameter corresponds to an entirely different distribution family weibull than a positive shape parameter fréchet within the gev family additionally these three catchments experience the biggest change in growth curve slope between either the 1 and 24 h duration or the 12 and 24 h duration while the rate of change of growth curve slope is less for durations above 24 h that is there is a change in growth curve slope in the sub daily durations that is not replicated in the longer durations in summary we observe high error for out of sample durations at gravå gryta and grosettjern because the relationship between the longer floods used to fit the model does not strongly inform the relationship between sub daily floods for these catchments 4 4 comparison of in and out of sample sub daily estimates here the models were fit with six durations 1 12 24 36 48 60 h where the 1 and 12 h durations are evaluated as in sample durations the output from these models is then compared to the output from the previous section where the models are fit on four durations 24 36 48 60 h that are used to predict the 1 and 12 h durations the performance of each of these sets is evaluated at the 1 and 12 h durations using both the iqd as shown in fig 10 and mape as shown in fig 11 the stations that have the greatest loss when going from in sample to out of sample tend to be stations that already had high iqd or mape values this means that if there is already a significant difference between the qdf and reference models this difference is likely to be amplified when predicting out of sample durations most stations and durations however have a relatively moderate loss when moving from in to out of sample on both the iqd and mape the exceptions to this are labeled in figs 10 and 11 for the mape this difference is on the order of 5 5 discussion we have in accordance with our main objective analyzed how different qdf models capture the relationship between floods of different duration at 12 locations in norway by examining differences in model fit between the three models studied we identified reasoning to explain why the extended qdf model double delta outperforms the other two models on the particular stations and durations studied and why this performance advantage is particularly pronounced for situations where the focus is on long return periods and or short durations additionally we tested the out of sample performance of qdf models on sub daily durations by comparing to models fit with the sub daily data included we observed situations where the out of sample set returned evaluation scores that were in line with the in sample set but also situations where the ability of qdf models to predict sub daily out of sample durations was severely limited finally we assessed whether the choice of durations used to fit the qdf models impacts model estimation and concluded qdf models are sensitive to the durations used to fit them the double delta model is what we term a empirical multiscaling model where the main contribution of the proposed model is the ability to adjust to certain types of changes in dependence structure with respect to return period specifically it can account for the situation where the ratio between growth curves increases with increasing return period the original qdf model javelle on the other hand assumes this ratio to be constant as evidenced by the return level plots in figs e 12 e 15 the assumption of a constant ratio will commonly not hold in particular if the shortest duration of 1 h is included in the comparison the additional parameter in the double delta model allows for a better approximation of the tail behavior especially for short durations selectively adding the second delta as the mixture model does is not advantageous at the shortest durations as these durations tend to need maximum flexibility from the qdf models we make a distinction here between what we call empirical multiscaling and multiscaling in the strict theoretical sense strict theoretical multiscaling models would be for example those presented in gupta and waymire 1990 or the idf models in van de vyver 2018 this distinction is often overlooked in the literature since the parameterization of empirical and strict multiscaling models are in most cases identical and the theoretical basis matters only for inference however we think it useful to note that the qdf models presented here are empirical and do not attempt to place strict mathematical assumptions on how the variance or other higher order moments change with increasing duration a second important distinction needs to be made between qdf models and bivariate frequency analyses where the dependence structure between peak discharge and event duration is explicitly modeled the aggregation based approach to obtaining annual maxima means qdf models provide an accessible way to get relationships between peak volume and duration for applications where the total volume of water is of interest if singular flood events are the focus for example if we need to know how long a road is closed following a particular flood event a bivariate event based approach such as one of the copula models detailed in gräler et al 2013 is more appropriate qdf models are most useful when three considerations are kept in mind firstly we found that the choice of durations used to fit the qdf model was a highly influential aspect of the modeling process the particular durations chosen will impact what relationship between floods the qdf models can identify in general qdf models predict sub daily unobserved durations just as well as when those durations are used to fit the model however as shown in section 4 4 it is possible to select in sample durations that do not inform the duration of interest avoiding this situation requires careful selection of appropriate in sample durations such selection can be guided by design value application for example it is unlikely we would need the 60 or 72 h duration on the smallest catchments in this study and can therefore avoid the somewhat contrived scenarios where we use what are for these catchments only long duration flood events to estimate the shortest durations secondly the range of the selected durations also influences the qdf model estimates if the durations selected do not span a wide enough range the qdf models will struggle to converge section 4 1 however too wide a range of durations can be challenging for qdf models if the statistical properties of the floods change significantly between durations section 4 2 we note that problems associated with the latter situation can be partially mitigated through the extra flexibility afforded by the extended qdf model double delta thirdly we found that generating too many sets of dependent data to fit the model can produce results that are both biased and overconfident particularly when the generated data is aggregated over a longer time span than the duration of interest fig 4 the qdf model assumes a constant shape parameter across all durations as with nearly all duration dependent extreme value models fauer et al 2021 this situation is illustrated in panel b of fig 6 it would be technically possible to add duration dependence to the shape parameter of the models in eqs 9 13 and 15 however the observed difficulties in estimating the shape parameter in section 4 3 and the issues documented in martins and stedinger 2000 indicate this approach may be very complex and pose severe estimation problems additionally observation of the shape parameter values from individually fit gev distributions demonstrate the shape parameter does not appear to change with duration in as structured a way as either the median flood η or the change in slope of the growth curves where this change is described in part by β the double delta model is a promising avenue for improved modeling of short duration events and events with long return periods under a qdf modeling framework we identify several areas of future research extending the analysis presented in this paper to include more gauging stations including stations in diverse climate regions is a priority while the catchments used in this study are diverse for nordic catchments they are not diverse globally additionally of particular interest is how this extended qdf model will function in a regional setting many of the design flood values needed for operational use in norway are at ungauged sites or at sites with incomplete or very short datasets furthermore it could be beneficial to include a more explicit consideration of flood generating processes within qdf methods seasonal needs in reservoir management for example can mean that a varying flood storage capacity needs to be defined within a year methods exist to explicitly account for generating processes in ffa see for example the mixture models in fischer 2018 but are not directly suited to the aggregation based methodology underlying qdf a potential avenue forward could be definition of seasonal blocks as in ulrich et al 2021 who developed idf curves with monthly varying parameters additionally a potential area of improvement for predicting short durations when the majority of the data is at a daily or longer time resolution is to allow the qdf models to take data where the length of the data record varies by duration such that some information on short durations can be included even if the data for these durations is relatively scant finally non stationarity due to climate change will be an important future area of research for qdf models while this is outside the scope of this study we identify a few references that could serve as an example for future research nonstationarity is addressed for regional qdf models in cunderlik and ouarda 2006 and for regional ffa models in a bayesian framework in guo et al 2022 6 conclusions this paper proposes a multiscaling extension of the qdf model of javelle et al 2002 where the magnitude of the index flood and the slope of the growth curve may scale independently with duration in the original qdf model only the magnitude of the index flood scales across durations javelle et al 2002 a bayesian inference algorithm is developed where the original qdf model the extended qdf model or a mixture of the two may be estimated in a case study comprising 12 study locations in norway we analyze how these three different qdf models capture the relationship between floods of different duration the results suggest it is advantageous to allow the index flood and growth curve slope to scale independently that is it is advantageous to let the ratio between growth curves of different duration be dependent on return period this advantage is particularly pronounced for situations where the focus is on long return periods and or short durations thus the extended qdf model is the most promising avenue for capturing flood behavior at the shortest sub daily durations in general qdf models are generally able to predict out of sample durations with a relatively moderate loss in accuracy when compared to in sample estimates for the same durations however we found the qdf framework to be highly sensitive to the choice of durations used to fit the models in particular care should be taken to fit the qdf models with the minimum number of durations needed for the inference algorithm to converge generating too many sets of dependent data to fit the model can produce results that are both biased and overconfident the extended qdf model has an improved ability to simultaneously model a wider range of durations when compared to the original qdf model credit authorship contribution statement danielle m barna methodology software

1945,design flood values give estimates of flood magnitude within a given return period and are essential to making adaptive decisions around land use planning infrastructure design and disaster mitigation many hydrologic applications where flood retention is important e g floodplain management and reservoir design need design flood values for different durations flood duration frequency qdf models extend the standard statistical flood frequency analysis framework to multiple flood durations and are analogous to intensity duration frequency models for precipitation implementations of qdf models commonly assume simple scaling where only the magnitude of the index flood is assumed to change with duration despite empirical analyses showing a more complex dependence structure we propose a multiscaling extension to existing qdf models where the magnitude of the index flood and the slope of the growth curve may scale independently with duration in an application to 12 locations in norway we assess how three different qdf models capture relationships between floods of different duration incorporating duration dependency independently in both the index flood and the growth curve extended qdf model improves modeling of both short duration events and events with long return periods this model extension further expands the models ability to simultaneously model a wide range of durations as measured by the integrated quadratic distance the extended qdf model performs better than the original qdf model in 83 of the out of sample subdaily durations studied additionally we find

society worldwide their destructive capacity is likely to increase in the near future due to a rise in both the prevalence of floods under climate change and an increase in the economic value of flood prone areas alfieri et al 2017 field et al 2012 estimation of design floods is an important aspect of societal adaptation to increased flood risk such estimation can be undertaken in one of three general ways e g filipova et al 2019 1 statistical flood frequency analysis ffa where observed historical flood events are used to estimate the magnitude of flood events with a certain return period 2 event based hydrological modeling for a single design event where design rainfall or other single realizations of initial conditions and precipitation are used as input to a hydrological model that simulates the desired flood event and 3 derived flood frequency methods which use weather generators coupled with hydrologic models to simulate long series of synthetic discharge that can be used to statistically estimate the desired return periods the first approach statistical ffa is the focus of this paper flood duration frequency qdf models extend the standard statistical ffa framework to multiple flood durations and are analogous to intensity duration frequency idf models for precipitation many hydrologic applications where flood retention is important e g floodplain management and reservoir design need flood estimates for different durations typically the annual maxima used in qdf modeling are sampled from discharge series averaged over different durations javelle et al 2002 cunderlik and ouarda 2006 this means that the duration d represents the total flow volume for a time span of d hours not flood events that lasted precisely d hours this aggregation based approach to obtaining annual maxima means qdf models provide an accessible way to get relationships between total flow volumes and durations for applications where the total volume of water is of interest in the qdf approach an extreme value distribution usually the generalized extreme value or gev distribution is fit to annual maxima from different durations then the relationship between the durations and the fitted distributions is described by the qdf model this allows for the quantiles of the distribution to be parametrically expressed as a continuous formulation of both return period and duration where consistency between the quantiles of the distribution at different durations is enforced by the qdf model javelle et al 2002 in practice this means that for example the t year flood for the mean daily streamflow time series will never report a higher return level than the t year flood for the instantaneous streamflow time series where t describes the return period of the flood such consistency is not guaranteed when estimating extreme value distributions individually for several fixed durations and remains one of the main benefits of qdf modeling in situations where the return level at several durations is of interest in addition the parametric nature of the qdf model allows for extrapolation to unobserved durations and establishes the potential for prediction in ungauged basins javelle et al 2002 the foundations of qdf modeling were developed in the 1990s through analysis of the relationships between n day flood volumes as explored in balocki and burges 1994 and sherwood 1994 the original qdf model is generally attributed to javelle et al 1999 qdf modeling has found most of its application in france canada and britain in the early 2000s javelle et al 2002 2003 zaidman et al 2003 although it has been applied a handful of times in the decades since cunderlik et al 2007 crochet 2012 onyutha and willems 2015 in a guide to hydrological practices the world meteorological organization 2009 notes that qdf analysis remains under utilized despite its strong potential in more recent years the qdf model has been used to characterize flood events of different duration in algeria renima et al 2018 to inform development of a depth duration frequency relationship used to assess risk of rainfall driven floods in poland markiewicz 2021 and as a comparison point to idf models when assessing catchment behavior for runoff extremes in austria breinl et al 2021 as noted in breinl et al 2021 the relationship quantified by the qdf model is an analogue to the relationship quantified in idf modeling for precipitation extremes in the hypothetical situation where all rainfall becomes runoff and the time of concentration is instantaneous the qdf and idf models have identical relationships available qdf models usually assume that only the index flood changes with duration with the growth curve assumed constant across durations e g javelle et al 2002 cunderlik and ouarda 2006 breinl et al 2021 here the index flood is the median annual maximum flood the growth curve is a scaled version of the flood frequency curve created by taking the ratio of the flood of any frequency to the index flood robson and reed 1999 the multiplication of the growth curve and the index flood gives the flood frequency curve we find it useful to discuss the flood frequency curve in terms of index floods and growth curves for a few reasons first it clarifies the discussion around an established problem with qdf models second the concept of the flood frequency curve as an index flood and a growth curve fits with the reparameterization introduced in section 3 third this language and reparameterization of the flood frequency curve aligns with regionalization methods note that growth curves are presented in dalrymple 1960 as basic dimensionless frequency curves allowing for cross catchment comparisons this assumption of constant growth curve across durations contradicts empirical analyses of runoff scaling properties in norway that show the ratio between peak and daily floods may be dependent on return period engeland et al 2020 sælthun et al 1997 multiscaling models that allow for this behavior that is models that allow for the ratio between growth curves of different durations to be dependent on return period already exist in the idf literature van de vyver 2018 courty et al 2019 fauer et al 2021 however in all existing models the different scaling components are placed on the location and the scale parameter of the gev distribution respectively this hinders a direct interpretation in terms of scaling of the index flood on the one hand and the growth curve on the other hand here we propose a multiscaling extension of the qdf model of javelle et al 2002 where the magnitude of the index flood and the slope of the growth curve may scale independently with duration the natural sparsity of available extreme value data means parameter estimation is in general challenging for extreme value models scarrott and macdonald 2012 the additional parameters introduced by multiscaling models compound these challenges fauer et al 2021 we introduce an alternative parameterization of what we call the characteristic duration parameters that allows for more numerical stability in addition we adopt a bayesian estimation approach that allows for all parameters to be estimated concurrently bayesian estimation of idf models is well established and provides advantages such as accessible uncertainty assessments scaling to regional models via hierarchical bayesian approaches and the ability to add information through prior distributions have been shown to be relevant cheng and aghakouchak 2014 huard et al 2010 current qdf models are typically estimated in a two step procedure where the characteristic duration parameter is estimated first followed by an estimation of the remaining parameters javelle et al 2002 cunderlik et al 2007 however such two step estimation does not typically provide uncertainty information is difficult to use with multiscaling models and moreover requires additional assumptions if the model is to be used in a regional context cunderlik and ouarda 2006 design flood estimation is often most concerned with estimation of peak discharge in this case a statistical estimation poses a challenge since flood series of length appropriate for statistical ffa often contain segments at a daily or coarser time resolution this is dealt with in practice as a data quality issue most national guidelines for ffa outline detailed data quality control steps and recommend application of ffa only when fine resolution time series of suitable length exist or when catchment properties are such that daily data can be trusted to provide a representative profile of the flood peak ball et al 2019 england et al 2019 castellarin et al 2012 in the situation where we have neither fine resolution time series nor catchment properties that allow for construction of the flood peak from daily data there exist methodologies for scaling daily data to approximate the instantaneous peak flow ding et al 2015 fill and steiner 2003 in norway scaling between daily and instantaneous peak flows is performed by establishing a relationship between the daily flows and the instantaneous peak flows for the largest floods in the catchment in the case where no data is available the relationship can be provided by a hydrologically similar catchment wilson et al 2011 notes the uncertainty in this method is likely to be large and difficult to reconcile with the uncertainty inherent to ffa therefore it is of interest to investigate the skill of qdf models to predict floods at subdaily unobserved durations based on their parametric assumptions and available coarser time resolution data at the site of interest to summarize the main objective of this study is to assess how different qdf models capture relationships between floods of different duration in particular we want to answer the following questions i is there one qdf model that best captures flood behavior at the shortest sub daily durations ii what are the models abilities when estimating in sample and out of sample durations and iii how sensitive are qdf models to input durations to this aim we evaluate three different models one of which is the original qdf model as presented in javelle et al 2002 the other two models investigated are new qdf models that allow for differing degrees of duration dependency in the growth curve for comparison three parameter gev distributions are fit independently to each duration in line with the current guidelines midtømme 2011 england et al 2019 the remainder of the paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the data and describes several data artifacts unique to qdf modeling section 3 presents the three qdf models investigated in this study and details both the bayesian framework and markov chain monte carlo mcmc sampling to facilitate both interpretation and inference a quantile based reparameterization of the gev distribution is proposed section 4 describes qdf model behavior and assesses performance in relation to locally fit gev distributions the paper finishes with a discussion section 5 and conclusions section 6 2 data the flood data came from 12 streamflow stations in norway that have at least 28 years of quality controlled data with minimal influence from reservoirs and other installations that might alter the natural streamflow see engeland et al 2016 for details all streamflow data were taken from the norwegian hydrological database hydra ii hosted by the norwegian water resources and energy directorate nve the locations of the gauging stations as well as catchment areas and flood generating processes are shown in fig 1 the selected stations are diverse relative to nordic catchments allowing us to evaluate the qdf models on a variety of flood behaviors see table d 7 for a listing of selected catchment properties the catchment size ranges from 6 31 km 2 gravå to 570 km 2 etna in norway the two major flood generating processes are snowmelt and rain in fig 1 this is illustrated as the average fractional rain contribution to each flood event the average rainfall contribution was estimated by calculating the ratio of rainfall to total water depth from both rainfall and snowmelt accumulated in a time window prior to each flood and then averaging these ratios over all flood events for details see engeland et al 2020 a fraction of rain value close to one means the floods at this location are primarily driven by rain a value closer to zero means snowmelt is the dominant flood generating mechanism rain was calculated from the precipitation and temperature from senorge 2 0 dataset lussana et al 2019 snow melt was extracted from the senorge snow model saloranta 2014 in our dataset the rain contribution varies from 0 32 at grosettjern to 0 95 at røykenes 2 1 data quality control each of the streamflow records encompasses a variety of collection methods these differing collection methods provide data at different frequencies typically we find daily time resolution in the first part of a streamflow record and a higher frequency of measurements in the latter part of the streamflow record after adoption of digitized limnigraph records and or digital measurements it is necessary to make sure that the sampling frequency of the data is high enough to represent peak flood magnitudes with sufficient quality this is especially important at small catchments a higher frequency of measurements is needed to capture the behavior of quicker flashier floods vs slower smoother floods in the records for the smallest catchments this constraint excludes substantial parts with a daily sampling frequency for two large primarily snowmelt driven catchments etna and viskvatn we used the daily data in addition to the more high resolution data the daily data was collected beginning in 1920 for etna and in 1903 for viksvatn the high resolution data was collected from 1983 2022 for etna and from 1985 2022 for viksvatn for all the remaining stations we used data from approximately 1970 to 2022 which is collected via a combination of limnigraph and digital readings precise record lengths can be found in table d 7 the time resolution of the digital measurements and the digitization of the limnigraph records were selected by nve to be frequent enough to represent flood peaks at individual stations in addition to quality control on the sampling frequency the data have already undergone a detailed quality control by the hydrometric section at nve ice jams are an issue at many stations in norway and may influence the validity of the rating curves used to calculate streamflows from measured water levels when needed specific correction procedures as specified in internal quality assurance protocols at nve have been applied to get correct discharge any year with less than 300 days of data was discarded the final data set contains no extraordinary flood events as seen in appendix e 2 2 data processing for qdf the data set for the qdf analysis is constructed from an evenly spaced streamflow time series at the reference duration where the reference duration is the finest time resolution of interest even spacing in the reference duration is enforced via regular sampling of a linear interpolation of the observed data let x 0 τ be this time series at the reference duration a moving average of window length d was applied to x 0 τ to manufacture a new time series x d t 1 x d t 1 d t d 2 t d 2 x 0 τ d τ block maxima or peak over threshold values can then be extracted from x d t to form sets of maxima given as 2 q d 1 q d 2 q d k where in the case of annual maxima k is the number of years of data the width d used as the length of the averaging window corresponds to the duration of interest and the average in eqn 1 can be repeatedly applied under different d to manufacture new sets of maxima that correspond to different durations of interest under this aggregation approach the durations d represent the total volume of water that arrives over a time span of d hours not flood events that lasted precisely d hours these sets of maxima produced under different d are dependent that is since longer duration series are always aggregated from series of shorter duration the values in one set of maxima depend on the values in the other sets recent advances in idf have focused on use of multivariate extreme value theory models which explicitly model this dependence structure between sets of maxima jurado et al 2020 the qdf models presented in this study are simpler so called univariate extreme value theory models and do not account for this dependence structure we use fig 2 to justify the choice of the simpler model the aggregation to total flow volume over a time span of duration d described in eq 1 introduces a dependency structure that is neither predictable nor directly relatable to catchment properties fig 2 demonstrates this first annual maxima for different durations are in some cases primarily issued from the same flood event however in other cases the maxima at different durations are based on different flood events with potentially different flood generating processes in the first scenario the annual maxima have a strong dependency due to overlapping temporal support and serial correlation in the second there is weak dependency this presence or absence of this change in across duration correlation is not directly relatable to catchment properties second annual maxima are not guaranteed to decrease as the duration of the averaging window is increased and the circumstances that produce this inconsistent behavior in maxima for example two flood events of similar volume occurring within a short time period of each other or a particularly wide and flat topped flood event are also not directly relatable to catchment properties 3 methods extreme value theory allows for the estimation of extreme events by providing a framework for modeling the tail of probability distributions where such extreme events would lie let x 1 x n be a set of continuous univariate random variables that are assumed to be independent and identically distributed if the normalized distribution of the maximum max x 1 x n converges as n then it converges to a gev distribution fisher and tippett 1928 jenkinson 1955 see coles 2001 for further details in flood frequency analysis the set of values that is taken to be distributed gev is typically the set of annual maxima the gev distribution is governed by a location scale and shape parameter the special case where the shape parameter is equal to zero is termed the gumbel or two parameter distribution both distributions are used in european ffa and an overview of country specific application can be found in castellarin et al 2012 previous research castellarin et al 2012 midtømme 2011 kobierska et al 2018 recommends the three parameter gev distribution for ffa on individual norwegian stations the following qdf models are thus based in the three parameter form of the gev where the cumulative distribution function of the gev is given as 3 g z exp 1 ξ z μ σ 1 ξ which is defined on z 1 ξ z μ σ 0 with parameter bounds μ σ 0 and ξ and where z would be the observed annual maximum streamflow for duration d for a specific year the case where the shape parameter ξ is equal to zero is interpreted as the limit when ξ 0 the remainder of this section is organized as follows first a quantile based reparameterization of gev distribution is adopted then three different qdf models one established model and two newmodels are introduced under this reparameterization finally the fitting methodologies and model evaluation metrics are described 3 1 reparameterization of the gev distribution the parameters of a gev model are most easily interpreted in terms of the quantile expressions traditional descriptors such as the mean and variance are inappropriate for the skewed distribution of the gev and moreover are undefined for certain values of the ξ parameter coles 2001 we reparametrize the gev distribution using the α 0 5 quantile in line with the recent work of castro camilo et al 2022 the relationship between the location parameter μ and the location parameter under the reparameterization η i e the median flood is given as 4 η μ σ log 2 ξ 1 ξ if ξ 0 μ log log 2 if ξ 0 estimates of extreme quantiles are obtained by substituting η from eq 4 for μ in eq 3 and inverting the result giving 5 z p η σ log 1 p ξ log 2 ξ ξ here g z p 1 p and z p is the return level associated with the return period t such that t 1 p finally to reduce dependency between parameters the scale parameter is decomposed as a product of the median flood and a remainder term expressed as an exponential function e β such that the new scale parameter β is given as 6 β log σ η the location parameter η has a more reasonable interpretation under the reparameterization in eq 5 it is now the median of the gev distribution with units of m 3 s consequently it is much easier to choose informative priors under the reparameterization an important advantage in a bayesian framework gelman et al 2013 in addition to providing interpretable parameters this parameterization has the added benefit of aligning with the index flood approach popular in regional flood frequency modeling where the median flood for a group of catchments is taken as a typical or index flood dalrymple 1960 explicitly including the median as a parameter in the model means the order of magnitude of a flood can be separated from the shape and slope of the growth curve this has potential to simplify the search for regressors in a regional qdf model castro camilo et al 2022 3 2 models this section discusses three competing models first the original qdf model from javelle et al 2002 is presented under the reparameterization in section 3 1 then the new extended qdf model is introduced finally a mixture model taking components from both previous models is introduced each of these models introduces additional parameters to the classic gev model the models differ in the number of additional parameters added but can all be classified as duration dependent gev or d gev models we motivate the development of the extended multiscaling qdf model with fig 3 the leftmost panel of the figure shows several flood frequency curves estimated independently for four durations the curves for 48 and 72 h are inconsistent that is the 72 h frequency curve crosses the 48 h curve physically there should not be a larger total volume of water during a 48 h interval than a 72 h interval these inconsistencies can arise when we ignore duration dependence in both the index flood and growth curve that is when we estimate durations independently qdf models enforce consistency between flood frequency curves of different duration as the middle and right panels of fig 3 show existing qdf models account for duration dependence in the index flood but not the growth curve this is termed simple scaling and is illustrated in the middle panel of fig 3 however ignoring the effect of duration dependency on the growth curve can lead to poor estimation in the tails of the distribution models that account for duration dependency in both the index flood and growth curve are called multiscaling models the extended qdf model accounts for duration dependency in the growth curve by allowing the both the magnitude of the index flood and the slope of the growth curve to change with duration right panel fig 3 3 2 1 original qdf model the annual maxima under the original qdf model proposed in javelle et al 2002 are independently distributed 7 q d i gev η d β ξ where 8 η d η 1 d δ 1 and the quantile function under the reparameterization in section 3 1 is given as 9 z d p η 1 d δ 1 e β log 1 p ξ log 2 ξ ξ where δ 0 note the inverse of the characteristic duration parameter δ from javelle s original qdf model is used here for numerical stability during estimation a high value for δ indicates the total flow volume arrives quickly analogous to a flashy peaked hydrograph with a pronounced duration dependency for the median flood whereas a value close to zero indicates a slower timespan analogous to a wide hydrograph with minor duration dependency for the floods the traditional flood frequency curve that is a gev distribution fit to an instantaneous time series is recovered in the limit of the aggregation window as d 0 in javelle s model only η is dependent on d and δ this aligns with the literature base for idf modeling in the sense that the model can be written as a separable function of d and p notice further that if the 1 d δ quantity in eq 9 was replaced with a power relationship the model would match that of the idf models summarized in koutsoyiannis et al 1998 the power relationship and separable functional dependence of the idf model has its roots in stochastic process theory although the model as typically applied does not rely on this theory base since idf models do not attempt to make explicit mathematical statements about how the higher order moments e g variance change with duration koutsoyiannis et al 1998 since only the magnitude of the median flood η is duration dependent in the model in eq 9 the underlying assumption of the original qdf model is that the slope of the growth curve does not change with duration 3 2 2 extended qdf model the extended qdf model referred to as the double delta qdf model is structured to be able to capture differences in slope of the growth curves coming from peak and daily values or indeed values coming from any two different aggregation intervals changing the steepness of the growth curve dependent on duration requires extra flexibility in the tail behavior of the model so the model allows η and β to depend on the aggregation interval d and additional parameters δ 1 and δ 2 respectively the ξ parameter is kept duration invariant due to the difficulties in estimating the ξ parameter stemming from the involved parametric form of the cdf eq 3 under double delta the annual maxima are independently distributed as 10 q d i gev η d β d ξ where 11 η d η 1 d δ 1 1 12 β d log σ η d 1 d δ 2 and the distribution s quantiles for a duration d corresponding to exceedance probability p are given by 13 z d p η 1 d δ 1 1 e β 1 d δ 2 log 1 p ξ log 2 ξ ξ with constraint 14 0 δ 2 δ 1 the constraint on the delta parameters reflects the fact that the data aggregation performed in qdf modeling see section 2 2 is more likely to have a larger effect on the flood magnitude than on the decomposed scale parameter recall that the value of the δ 1 parameter reflects the flashiness of the floods measured a narrow hydrograph will be associated with larger values of δ 1 the δ 2 parameter does not have an equally accessible hydrologic interpretation but can be interpreted as a measure of difference in growth curve slope across aggregation intervals that is if the ratio between peak and daily floods is heavily dependent on return period we would expect to see larger values of δ 2 as the aggregation window shrinks to zero that is as d 0 the double delta model is equivalent to the standard gev model that creates the traditional flood frequency curve similarly as δ 2 0 the double delta model approaches javelle s qdf model double delta can thus be considered an extension of javelle in the same way javelle is an extension of the traditional flood frequency curve 3 2 3 mixture model the mixture model is proposed in an attempt to access the flexibility of the double delta model without adding unnecessary complexity the model is a weighted average of the double delta and javelle models such that the density of the annual maxima is given by 15 j 1 2 m j g θ j where m j is the weight on the component model g is the density of the gev distribution θ 1 η d dd β d dd ξ dd and θ 2 η d j β j ξ j here the superscripts on the parameter sets denote the double delta and javelle models respectively using bayesian methodologies and the reversible jump algorithm detailed in section 3 3 parameter estimation and selection can be carried out simultaneously and the δ 2 parameter is only added if merited thus eq 15 is a representation of a non standard density from which it is possible to obtain quantile estimates that are an average over the distributions given by the double delta model in eq 10 and the javelle model in eq 7 3 3 bayesian framework for the javelle and double delta models bayesian inference is performed using a metropolis within gibbs algorithm robert and casella 2004 that is samples from the conditional distribution of the parameters θ 1 and θ 2 respectively are obtained by iterative sampling from the full conditional distributions of the individual parameters so that each component of the model is updated in turn prior distributions for the individual parameters assume independence the prior on η which has units of m 3 s is a diffuse truncated normal distribution truncnormal 40 100 with lower bound at zero the prior on β is a diffuse normal 0 100 for ξ we follow the methodology in martins and stedinger 2000 and use a shifted beta 6 9 distribution on the interval 0 5 0 5 the prior for δ 1 in the double delta model which is equivalent to the prior for δ in the javelle model is a lognormal 0 5 the same values are used in the prior for δ 2 which uses a truncated lognormal where the lower bound of the prior is given by δ 1 the conditional distribution of the mixture model is given by 16 p m θ q p m p θ m g q θ m where p is the generic conditional distribution consistent with this joint specification and m dd j θ θ 1 θ 2 and q q d i i 1 d 1 i k d n where k is the number of years of data and n is the total number of durations the models have equal prior probability with p m j p m d d 0 5 simplification of eq 16 considering the model without the model specification and separate parameter sets gives the conditional distributions of double delta and javelle moving between models changes the dimension of θ to account for this we employ a reversible jump mcmc algorithm similar to the reversible jump methodology for normal mixtures described in richardson and green 1997 the reversible jump mcmc proceeds as follows 1 updating θ a if m dd update η dd else update η j b if m dd update β dd else update β j c if m dd update ξ dd else update ξ j d if m dd update δ 1 and δ 2 parameters in sequence else update δ 2 splitting one delta into two or combining two deltas into one step 1 is repeated 10 times under the same model before step 2 proposal to jump between models is taken repeating step 1 for either the javelle or double delta model details the mcmc algorithm used to fit the respective model to move from double delta to javelle we need to merge δ 1 and δ 2 into one δ the combine proposal is deterministic and given by 17 δ δ 1 δ 2 the reverse split proposal going from javelle to double delta involves one degree of freedom so we generate a random variable u such that 18 u b e t a 5 1 which is then used to set 19 δ 1 u δ δ 2 1 u δ for this split move the acceptance probability is min 1 a where 20 a p m θ q p m θ q q u j where q u is the density function of u and j is the jacobian of the transformation described in eq 19 the acceptance probability for the corresponding combine move is min 1 a 1 but with substitutions that adhere to the proposal in eq 17 3 3 1 posterior return levels the markov chains detailed above return a collection of r samples 21 θ r r 1 r where r is the total number of iterations in the mcmc with a suitable number of burn in samples removed under the mixture model θ can be either θ 1 or θ 2 dependent on iteration r while posterior samples under double delta or javelle will return only θ 1 or θ 2 respectively this markov sample of the parameter set directly yields by using the quantile function in either 9 or 13 a sample of quantiles 22 z d p 1 z d p r this sample approximates the posterior distribution of the p th return level at duration d from this sample it is possible to derive approximations for the posterior mean and its credible intervals 3 4 evaluation methods to assess the models we compare qdf model output to gev distributions fit locally to each duration comparison is quantified first through the proper evaluation metric integrated quadratic distance iqd thorarinsdottir et al 2013 further since the iqd is a measure of overall distributional similarity and is not always sensitive to small differences in tail behavior we calculate the mean absolute percentage error mape for select high quantiles the iqd measures the similarity between two distributions by integrating over the squared distance between the distribution functions let g be the distribution function defined by the local gev fit and g qdf be the distribution function defined by the qdf model at the corresponding duration in practice we approximate g and g qdf by the empirical cdf of a sample from the posterior the distance between g and g qdf as measured by the iqd is then given by 23 iqd g z g qdf z 2 d z where lower values of the iqd indicate better overall performance the iqd is the score divergence associated with the well known proper scoring rule the continuous ranked probability score crps the main difference between iqd and crps is that crps calculates the integrated squared distance between a distribution and a scalar observation specified by a heaviside step function whereas iqd calculates the integrated squared distance between two distributions the mape provides a measure of similarity as the percent difference between the local gev fit and the qdf model let z d p qdf be the return level at probability p for the qdf model evaluated at duration d generated from the approximation to the posterior given in eq 22 similarly let z p gev d be the return level at probability p for the local gev fit to data at duration d then the mape is given by 24 mape 1 n i 1 n z p gev d z d p qdf z p gev d 100 where n is the number of stations at which we wish to calculate the mape 4 results we evaluate three models the original qdf model javelle the extended qdf model double delta and the mixture model we first assess how well the models capture flood behavior for in sample durations at a variety of catchments then we evaluate which of the models is most effective at predicting out of sample durations specifically short less than 24 h durations from long durations greater than or equal to 24 h finally we compare the models estimation abilities at in and out of sample durations model evaluation is carried out by comparing the qdf models to a collection of gev models fit individually to each duration the iqd is used to assess model behavior across all quantiles since it has low tail sensitivity it best captures model behavior where the bulk of our observations lie i e return periods for which we have observed data we turn to the mape to assess tail behavior where both the qdf model and the reference model are extrapolated beyond the range of observed data 4 1 model sensitivity to input durations the qdf models should be fit with the minimum number of durations needed to ensure converge of the mcmc sampler feeding too many sets of dependent data into the model can bias return level estimates and artificially narrow the credible intervals the bias is especially prevalent when the data is generated by aggregating over a longer time span and the goal is to predict short duration events to test this the models were fit under three different sets of data two durations 24 and 36 h four durations 24 36 48 72 h and six durations 24 36 48 72 96 120 h for the two duration set the mcmc sampler failed to converge results from the other two sets 24 72 and 24 120 are displayed in fig 4 the 24 120 set provides a comparatively worse fit the 90 credible interval for the this set fails to capture the locally fit gev models dashed gray lines for the 24 and 1 h durations and the return levels are also underestimated to a greater extent than in the 24 72 set this behavior is replicated across all three models and all twelve catchments results not shown 4 2 model performance on in sample durations here we present results where the three qdf models are compared against locally fit gev models at every in sample duration where the in sample durations are 1 24 48 and 72 h such an in sample comparison is useful for identifying specific scenarios where qdf models struggle to fit the data rather than strict model to model rankings since models with more parameters have an in sample advantage double delta is expected to perform better than either javelle or the mixture model return level plots displaying the qdf model output and the reference model at these four in sample durations are displayed in figs e 12 e 15 4 2 1 assessing model behavior using iqd a comparison of in sample iqd scores across stations durations and methods is given in fig 5 the scores are relatively similar across models most points fall on or along the diagonals in the two plots in fig 5 as expected the scores exhibit a slight preference towards the double delta model which has the lowest average iqd score at 0 034 highest distributional similarity to the reference model when all durations and stations are considered the mixture model has the next lowest score at 0 037 and javelle has the highest score at 0 040 the analysis shows duration specific preferences between models the double delta model has a better average iqd score than either javelle or the mixture model at every in sample duration where the average is taken over all 12 stations considered in the study however double delta s advantage is strongest at the shortest durations table 1 reports the number of stations at which double delta outperforms a comparison qdf model at each duration despite qdf models showing an overall good performance there are certain stations where each of the three qdf models differs substantially from the reference model this behavior is particularly prevalent for the 1 and 24 h durations at hugdal bru displayed in panel a of fig 6 we suspect the issues with the shorter durations at hugdal bru represent a conflict between the parameter constraints inherent in the qdf models and the runoff generating processes for sub daily streamflow at this particular station hugdal bru is heavily snowmelt driven with a strong diurnal melt pattern the data averaging used in qdf modeling smooths out this sub daily variation but this relatively large reduction in variance is not reflected in the parameter constraints of the qdf model since the primary scaling occurs on the median flood a constraint described in eq 14 thus the behavior of 1 h floods with return period under 5 years is difficult for the qdf models to fit floods with higher return periods tend to come from larger precipitation or melting events that supersede the diurnal cycle and as such have a more regular relationship between durations durations above 24 h without the diurnal cycle also have a more regular relationship between durations the qdf models assume a constant shape parameter across all durations included in the analysis as shown in panel b of fig 6 this assumption may lead to estimates that diverge from local duration independent estimates where the latter analysis yields substantially varying shape parameter estimates across the durations here the individually fit gev models have shape parameters ranging from 0 140 for the 1 h duration to 0 037 for the 72 h duration the qdf models do not have duration dependence built into the shape parameter and as such must choose one shape parameter for the entire set in this case 0 018 for double delta 0 021 for the mixture model and 0 036 for javelle this inflexibility of the shape parameter is a known limitation of qdf models but is not easily solved as this parameter faces estimation difficulties due to the involved parametric form of the cumulative distribution function of the gev as a result the qdf models tend to underestimate high quantiles for short durations and overestimate high quantiles for longer durations specifically for gryta using javelle the 1 h duration is underestimated and the 48 and 72 h durations are both overestimated to a greater extent than we see in the double delta model 4 2 2 assessing model behavior using mape the within sample mape was computed for the 100 year and 1000 year flood events 0 99 and 0 999 quantiles these quantiles lie beyond the observed range of data for most of the stations and thus require extrapolation of both the qdf models and the reference model the double delta model has the lowest mape at both return periods when all in sample durations and stations are taken into account 5 9 error at the 100 year return period and 10 0 error at the 1000 year return period the mixture model has the next lowest mape with 6 5 error at the 100 year return period and 12 1 error at the 1000 year return period the javelle model has the highest mape with 7 7 error at the 100 year return period and 12 1 error at the 1000 year return period as with the iqd the advantage of double delta is strongest at the shortest durations table 2 reports the number of stations at which double delta outperforms either javelle or the mixture model the addition of the second delta parameter has the most impact when estimating events with long return periods we see this in the differences in behavior of the model to model comparisons between the iqd and mape figs 5 and 7 javelle and the mixture model appear more similar when evaluated by the iqd than they do under the mape that is using the iqd score the two models have about the same amount of clustering around the diagonal when compared to double delta but using mape which measures differences in tail behavior between the qdf models and reference model we see a difference between javelle and mixture model when compared to double delta the values for the mixture model are much more closely clustered around the diagonal in fig 7 than the values for javelle these stations that show an improvement in mape under the mixture model are those that have a high weight on the second delta parameter one of the stations that is most improved by the addition of the second delta is gryta marked by gray squares in fig 7 the return level plots in panel b of fig 6 show this station in particular benefits from the adjustment of growth curve slope afforded by the second delta the second delta somewhat mitigates the effect of the assumption of a constant shape parameter across durations however even with this adjustment in growth curve slope both double delta and the mixture model have high error values for the 1 h duration at gryta around 20 30 4 3 model performance on out of sample durations here the models were fit with four durations 24 36 48 and 60 h and the resulting parameter estimates were used to predict the 1 and 12 h durations the qdf predictions were compared to locally fit gev models using both the iqd and mape return level plots showing the reference and qdf models at both out of sample durations are displayed in figs f 16 f 19 double delta has the best average iqd score on the out of sample durations reporting a score of 0 34 while the mixture model reports a score of 0 42 and javelle reports 0 44 fig 8 shows a model to model comparison on the out of sample durations there are only three station and duration combinations both the 1 and 12 h durations at sjodalsvatn and the 1 h duration at dyrdalsvatn and øyungen where double delta performs worse as measured by the iqd than the other two models these stations are outlined in red in fig 8 at every other station and duration double delta performs the same or better all three qdf models provide a poor distributional fit for the sub daily durations at hugdal bru and the 1 h duration at røykenes these stations are labeled by name in fig 8 difficulties fitting the sub daily durations of hugdal bru are discussed in section 4 2 1 the 1 h duration at røykenes exhibits a large change in shape parameter with an increase in duration like the station gryta shown in panel b of fig 6 double delta has the best average mape score on the out of sample durations 11 1 error at the 100 year return period and 15 4 error at the 1000 year return period the mixture model has the next lowest mape with 12 2 error at the 100 year return period and 16 9 error at the 1000 year return period the javelle model has the highest mape with 12 8 error at the 100 year return period and 17 4 error at the 1000 year return period double delta provides an equal or better fit at around 80 of the stations and durations at both return periods stations and durations where double delta is outperformed by either javelle or the mixture model are outlined in red in fig 9 several of the smallest catchments gravå gryta and grosettjern have high out of sample mape values these three catchments have some of the highest variation in the shape and slope of the individually fit gev models see tables a 3 and b 5 where the β parameter is taken as a proxy for slope a highly duration dependent shape parameter is a known challenge for qdf models see the scenario in panel b of fig 6 and we would expect the qdf models to struggle to find a shape parameter value that approximates both the longest and shortest durations even when these durations are in sample furthermore not only do we observe a large shape parameter range but this range crosses zero for both gryta and grosettjern with the longer durations having a negative shape parameter while the shorter durations have a positive shape parameter this is a substantial difference a negative shape parameter corresponds to an entirely different distribution family weibull than a positive shape parameter fréchet within the gev family additionally these three catchments experience the biggest change in growth curve slope between either the 1 and 24 h duration or the 12 and 24 h duration while the rate of change of growth curve slope is less for durations above 24 h that is there is a change in growth curve slope in the sub daily durations that is not replicated in the longer durations in summary we observe high error for out of sample durations at gravå gryta and grosettjern because the relationship between the longer floods used to fit the model does not strongly inform the relationship between sub daily floods for these catchments 4 4 comparison of in and out of sample sub daily estimates here the models were fit with six durations 1 12 24 36 48 60 h where the 1 and 12 h durations are evaluated as in sample durations the output from these models is then compared to the output from the previous section where the models are fit on four durations 24 36 48 60 h that are used to predict the 1 and 12 h durations the performance of each of these sets is evaluated at the 1 and 12 h durations using both the iqd as shown in fig 10 and mape as shown in fig 11 the stations that have the greatest loss when going from in sample to out of sample tend to be stations that already had high iqd or mape values this means that if there is already a significant difference between the qdf and reference models this difference is likely to be amplified when predicting out of sample durations most stations and durations however have a relatively moderate loss when moving from in to out of sample on both the iqd and mape the exceptions to this are labeled in figs 10 and 11 for the mape this difference is on the order of 5 5 discussion we have in accordance with our main objective analyzed how different qdf models capture the relationship between floods of different duration at 12 locations in norway by examining differences in model fit between the three models studied we identified reasoning to explain why the extended qdf model double delta outperforms the other two models on the particular stations and durations studied and why this performance advantage is particularly pronounced for situations where the focus is on long return periods and or short durations additionally we tested the out of sample performance of qdf models on sub daily durations by comparing to models fit with the sub daily data included we observed situations where the out of sample set returned evaluation scores that were in line with the in sample set but also situations where the ability of qdf models to predict sub daily out of sample durations was severely limited finally we assessed whether the choice of durations used to fit the qdf models impacts model estimation and concluded qdf models are sensitive to the durations used to fit them the double delta model is what we term a empirical multiscaling model where the main contribution of the proposed model is the ability to adjust to certain types of changes in dependence structure with respect to return period specifically it can account for the situation where the ratio between growth curves increases with increasing return period the original qdf model javelle on the other hand assumes this ratio to be constant as evidenced by the return level plots in figs e 12 e 15 the assumption of a constant ratio will commonly not hold in particular if the shortest duration of 1 h is included in the comparison the additional parameter in the double delta model allows for a better approximation of the tail behavior especially for short durations selectively adding the second delta as the mixture model does is not advantageous at the shortest durations as these durations tend to need maximum flexibility from the qdf models we make a distinction here between what we call empirical multiscaling and multiscaling in the strict theoretical sense strict theoretical multiscaling models would be for example those presented in gupta and waymire 1990 or the idf models in van de vyver 2018 this distinction is often overlooked in the literature since the parameterization of empirical and strict multiscaling models are in most cases identical and the theoretical basis matters only for inference however we think it useful to note that the qdf models presented here are empirical and do not attempt to place strict mathematical assumptions on how the variance or other higher order moments change with increasing duration a second important distinction needs to be made between qdf models and bivariate frequency analyses where the dependence structure between peak discharge and event duration is explicitly modeled the aggregation based approach to obtaining annual maxima means qdf models provide an accessible way to get relationships between peak volume and duration for applications where the total volume of water is of interest if singular flood events are the focus for example if we need to know how long a road is closed following a particular flood event a bivariate event based approach such as one of the copula models detailed in gräler et al 2013 is more appropriate qdf models are most useful when three considerations are kept in mind firstly we found that the choice of durations used to fit the qdf model was a highly influential aspect of the modeling process the particular durations chosen will impact what relationship between floods the qdf models can identify in general qdf models predict sub daily unobserved durations just as well as when those durations are used to fit the model however as shown in section 4 4 it is possible to select in sample durations that do not inform the duration of interest avoiding this situation requires careful selection of appropriate in sample durations such selection can be guided by design value application for example it is unlikely we would need the 60 or 72 h duration on the smallest catchments in this study and can therefore avoid the somewhat contrived scenarios where we use what are for these catchments only long duration flood events to estimate the shortest durations secondly the range of the selected durations also influences the qdf model estimates if the durations selected do not span a wide enough range the qdf models will struggle to converge section 4 1 however too wide a range of durations can be challenging for qdf models if the statistical properties of the floods change significantly between durations section 4 2 we note that problems associated with the latter situation can be partially mitigated through the extra flexibility afforded by the extended qdf model double delta thirdly we found that generating too many sets of dependent data to fit the model can produce results that are both biased and overconfident particularly when the generated data is aggregated over a longer time span than the duration of interest fig 4 the qdf model assumes a constant shape parameter across all durations as with nearly all duration dependent extreme value models fauer et al 2021 this situation is illustrated in panel b of fig 6 it would be technically possible to add duration dependence to the shape parameter of the models in eqs 9 13 and 15 however the observed difficulties in estimating the shape parameter in section 4 3 and the issues documented in martins and stedinger 2000 indicate this approach may be very complex and pose severe estimation problems additionally observation of the shape parameter values from individually fit gev distributions demonstrate the shape parameter does not appear to change with duration in as structured a way as either the median flood η or the change in slope of the growth curves where this change is described in part by β the double delta model is a promising avenue for improved modeling of short duration events and events with long return periods under a qdf modeling framework we identify several areas of future research extending the analysis presented in this paper to include more gauging stations including stations in diverse climate regions is a priority while the catchments used in this study are diverse for nordic catchments they are not diverse globally additionally of particular interest is how this extended qdf model will function in a regional setting many of the design flood values needed for operational use in norway are at ungauged sites or at sites with incomplete or very short datasets furthermore it could be beneficial to include a more explicit consideration of flood generating processes within qdf methods seasonal needs in reservoir management for example can mean that a varying flood storage capacity needs to be defined within a year methods exist to explicitly account for generating processes in ffa see for example the mixture models in fischer 2018 but are not directly suited to the aggregation based methodology underlying qdf a potential avenue forward could be definition of seasonal blocks as in ulrich et al 2021 who developed idf curves with monthly varying parameters additionally a potential area of improvement for predicting short durations when the majority of the data is at a daily or longer time resolution is to allow the qdf models to take data where the length of the data record varies by duration such that some information on short durations can be included even if the data for these durations is relatively scant finally non stationarity due to climate change will be an important future area of research for qdf models while this is outside the scope of this study we identify a few references that could serve as an example for future research nonstationarity is addressed for regional qdf models in cunderlik and ouarda 2006 and for regional ffa models in a bayesian framework in guo et al 2022 6 conclusions this paper proposes a multiscaling extension of the qdf model of javelle et al 2002 where the magnitude of the index flood and the slope of the growth curve may scale independently with duration in the original qdf model only the magnitude of the index flood scales across durations javelle et al 2002 a bayesian inference algorithm is developed where the original qdf model the extended qdf model or a mixture of the two may be estimated in a case study comprising 12 study locations in norway we analyze how these three different qdf models capture the relationship between floods of different duration the results suggest it is advantageous to allow the index flood and growth curve slope to scale independently that is it is advantageous to let the ratio between growth curves of different duration be dependent on return period this advantage is particularly pronounced for situations where the focus is on long return periods and or short durations thus the extended qdf model is the most promising avenue for capturing flood behavior at the shortest sub daily durations in general qdf models are generally able to predict out of sample durations with a relatively moderate loss in accuracy when compared to in sample estimates for the same durations however we found the qdf framework to be highly sensitive to the choice of durations used to fit the models in particular care should be taken to fit the qdf models with the minimum number of durations needed for the inference algorithm to converge generating too many sets of dependent data to fit the model can produce results that are both biased and overconfident the extended qdf model has an improved ability to simultaneously model a wider range of durations when compared to the original qdf model credit authorship contribution statement danielle m barna methodology software

1946,water management in the upper blue nile ubn region of ethiopia often entails fragmented efforts to supplement rainfed agriculture with surface water and reservoir based irrigation schemes on top of the broader climate change drought and water food insecurity issues the irrigation managers inability to accommodate farmer perceptions into sophisticated designs for resource utilization creates a fragile system from the root level driven by this the objective of this research is to carry out a socio hydrological investigation to highlight how hydrological models can be used to map farmers perception on irrigation water adequacy and water management fairness the study uses predictions from a calibrated modflow nwt groundwater gw model in two irrigated communities of ethiopia namely the koga reservoir closed community and the quashni river open community irrigation project areas farmer perceptions were studied through detailed household surveys n 172 households which were then statistically analyzed through logistic regression models under different sociological conjectures the socio hydrological investigation revealed that the local gw models were in good agreement with farmers raw perception on irrigation water adequacy and the fairness of irrigation management findings from this research would help advance our understanding in socio hydrological feedback of complex irrigation structures as well as underscoring key sociological constraints of irrigation development in emerging communities keywords sociohydrology groundwater modeling irrigation management fairness

historically depended on the june september jjas precipitation distribution opening ways to further harness irrigation to supplement the process in recent years yang et al 2020 you et al 2011 the rainfed agriculture in ethiopia purportedly affects the livelihood and associated social dynamics of around 85 of its population haile and kasa 2015 who may further be adversely affected by climate change induced precipitation uncertainties awulachew et al 2008 mccartney and girma 2012 leading to recurrentdroughtand food insecurity christensen et al 2007 mohamed 2017 yohannes et al 2017 ethiopia s irrigation potential is estimated at about 3 7 million ha of which only about 5 is irrigated haile and kasa 2015 tesfaye et al 2008 in recent years there has been a policy and application level effort to invest on dry season irrigation to improve crop yield and eventually improve societal outcomes bceom 1999 chebud and melesse 2009 kebede et al 2006 nigussie et al 2019 however in most cases sociotechnical limitations play a part in reducing the effectiveness of many local irrigation projects birhanu et al 2014 khadim et al 2021 yohannes et al 2017 previously studies related to water resource management in the blue nile area of ethiopia have focused on the hydrological modeling aspects bceom 1999 conway 1997 guariso and whittington 1987 johnson and curtis 1994 kebede et al 2006 legesse et al 2004 mccartney and girma 2012 sutcliffe and parks 1987 use of physically based hydrological models to assess surface and subsurface water resources and irrigation efficacy in the upper blue nile has also been attempted in recent years asrie and sebhat 2016 chebud and melesse 2009 khadim et al 2021 2020 lazin et al 2020 in khadim et al 2021 a numerical framework was developed centering around a modflow nwt groundwater gw model to assess the potential of gw based irrigation to address water stress situations and eventually improve irrigation the study considered different irrigation management scenarios and assessed the outcome through simulating water stress a situation defined as plants receiving less water than the potential transpiration which is required to sustain their optimal physiological processes while these studies have somewhat provided assessments on the availability of hydrological resources at different scales more integrated research including existing sociological challenges and how they impact ongoing water management efforts still lacks a robust study highlighting the relevant socio hydrological aspects would therefore not only benefit the effectiveness of existing irrigation management but provide a benchmark on the holistic understanding of water and society governance scholars characterize effective communities as those with transparent decision making accountability capacity to act voice and fair grievance practices graham et al 2003 by taking the broader sociological approach to include informal practices and discourses as well we distinguish open communities which incorporate stakeholders into the decision making process and reach decisions transparently from closed communities that isolate some stakeholders from decision making irrigation management may also entail an open or closed societal structure in an open scheme local farmers traditionally incorporate their voice in irrigation management through a participatory irrigation management pim structure while in a closed scheme more top down irrigation management structures exist regardless the success of an irrigation project would best be measured in addition to economic terms by its ability to satisfy the needs of different tiers of stakeholders ayella et al 2019 in both pim and top down cases there exist a complex chain of socio technical factors namely the optimal schedule and amount of irrigation selection of crop types and fertilizers soil conditions choosing planting dates amounts of lands to irrigate etc which altogether affect the satisfaction levels of farmers the end user most irrigation initiatives often disregard this aspect of farmer satisfaction and at times when a technical or management inefficiency hinders the irrigation outcome an unhealthy environment originates at the center of existing human water relationships to map the causal relationships of such farmer satisfactions thorough socio hydrological investigations are necessary such investigations would allow us to better understand the key linkages of irrigation management with farmers perceptions on fairness of an existing system driven by this our study aims to conduct a socio hydrological investigation using estimates from a calibrated groundwater model in irrigated communities of ethiopia to assess farmer s perception on water management fairness to do so we used the responses collected through household hh surveys in 172 households from two irrigated communities within the amhara region namely the koga irrigation project in kudmi kebele closed community and the quashni irrigation project in gayta kebele open community it should be noted that even though the ministry of water irrigation and energy is the leading formal regulatory body the level of government where the state and the majority of rural ethiopians interface is the kebele tesfaye 2002 young 1998 in the hh survey farmers were asked to report their satisfaction on a whether they receive enough water for irrigation during normal dry wet years y n answers and b whether they think the irrigation management was fair y n answers specifically using the calibrated groundwater models from these irrigated communities khadim et al 2021 2020 we simulated availability of irrigation water and soil moisture for normal dry wet years in the surveyed villages and compared with farmers perceptions to identify interesting socio hydrological cases and hence improve the existing understanding of human water interactions the investigation would then entail a socio hydrological analysis of select villages to identify scope of improvement in terms of achieving a better satisfaction level from the farmers over the past decade studying socio hydrological implications of development interventions have gained pace annys 2021 perdikaki et al 2022 sivapalan et al 2012 in the study by sivapalan et al 2012 the authors introduced socio hydrology as a new science underpinning the practice of iwrm and suggested the approach s merit in predicting future irrigation improvements by considering relevant public perceptions there were three distinct pathways illustrated in sivapalan et al 2012 through which socio hydrological studies can be used to improve the efficacy of hydrological interventions these are historical socio hydrology which includes reconstructing the past cases to better understand hydrological implications comparative socio hydrology which studies human water interactions across socio economic and climate gradients to underscore differences in irrigation outcomes in different catchments peel and blöschl 2011 wagener et al 2010 and process socio hydrology which allows in depth monitoring and data collection at small scale interventions to improve case specific understandings in a participatory groundwater modeling study by perdikaki et al 2022 stakeholder consultation outcomes were used to synthesize scenarios for future groundwater management our study envelops the comparative and process socio hydrological structure discussed above and devises a framework to reinforce the sociological efficacy of existing irrigation projects this is a novel type of socio hydrological investigation which eventually attempts to spatially link physically based groundwater model findings with sociological perceptions and as such rationalize the efficacy of such models for emerging communities where existing sociological settings challenge the optimal irrigation outcome the robust methodological framework described in this study maybe applied this could be useful in specifically evaluating open vs closed irrigated communities irrigation management and eventually contemplate the success and compromises of pim vs top down approaches the results obtained in our study could also be beneficial for the local and regional stakeholders in understanding the broader science implications of irrigation interventions this could facilitate water managers in attempts to modify existing practices to better satisfy the primary end users which in this case are the farmers this improved understanding of human water relationships would allow us to highlight local irrigation management bottlenecks and help us build strategies to foster adaptive pathways that could be useful for harnessing a sustainable societal development 2 data and methods 2 1 research framework as part of the socio hydrological investigation we compared public perception on equitable water sharing obtained from the hh surveys and related it with the model findings on soil moisture estimates and irrigation availability for different command areas coma of the irrigation schemes in both koga closed community and quashni open community key steps of the investigation carried out in this study are shown in the research framework in fig 1 in the figure the processes directly addressed in this research are highlighted in solid black arrows direct actions while the processes which may take place at a later time because of the direct actions and are key aspects of the overall socio hydrological framework to improve irrigation efficacy are highlighted in dashed gray arrows fig 1 the improved understanding of the hydrological model and its ability to guide specific irrigation aspects can contribute to the optimal design of irrigation interventions which coupled with pre existing internal sociological contexts or beliefs constitute the broader resource vulnerability context the vulnerability context affects the farmers perceptions or level of satisfaction with the existing irrigation management fairness the irrigation water availability ω a in normal c17 6 dry c19 1 6 and wet c19 2 6 years and whether the farmers think the irrigation water management ω m was fair during normal c17 7 dry c19 1 7 and wet c19 2 7 years the farmer s perception reverts to developing the internal pre existing condition which again shapes up the vulnerability context furthermore these perceptions also develop long term socio cultural practices and institutional trust moreover the analysis of perceptions may lead to development of sociological strategies to offset key challenges 2 2 study area the study was conducted in two irrigated communities namely the koga irrigation project from the kudmi kebele located in the mecha woreda and the quashni irrigation project from the gayta kebele located in the dangishta woreda shown in fig 2 these areas are located in the amhara region of ethiopia and are hydrologically connected with the gilgel abay river which discharges into lake tana a freshwater shallow and oligotrophic lake at the source of the upper blue nile river wood and talling 1988 the koga irrigation project is a large scale irrigation initiative feeding about 7 000 ha of command areas khadim et al 2021 lijalem 2018 which is controlled through a top down management initiative that regulates the releases from the koga reservoir the koga reservoir is created through a dam across the koga river which used to be one of the major tributaries of the gilgel abay river the irrigation project spreads through 12 command areas one for each secondary canal where irrigation water is supplied via main secondary tertiary and quaternary canals only up to tertiary canals are shown in fig 2 this is also referred to as a closed community where local farmers are not allowed to directly incorporate their feedback on irrigation management the other area is the small scale 250 ha quashni irrigation project where the local farmers themselves operate a weir structure to divert water from the gayta river to feed the main and secondary canals this is an open community where local farmers represent key positions at the kebele administrative level and make key decisions pertaining to irrigation scheduling and specified gate openings to regulate the amounts of releases in different irrigation months 2 3 data and models 2 3 1 hh surveys as part of the nsf pire water and food security project nsf pire 2020 a detailed household hh survey was conducted in 2018 19 spanning across a total of 96 villages and 1 920 households the pire project was an international research and education partnership to promote a political institutional model of science that links sociological economic and engineering methods in a people centered approach to the human climate water agriculture energy nexus in the blue nile basin bnb ethiopia the surveys were conducted in all four communities within the project area however only two communities are irrigated and reported in this study koga and quashni furthermore the surveys included questions on administrative aspects demographics as well asset managements which could not be directly tied with irrigation adequacy and fairness the variables we are interested in c17 6 c19 1 6 c19 2 6 c17 7 c19 1 7 and c19 2 7 were only answered by a total of 172 households interviewed from the two irrigated communities and accordingly were used in this study a list of all the other sociological variables recorded in the hh surveys is shown in appendix table a1 2 3 2 groundwater model details a newton raphson formulation for unconfined subsurface flow was applied using the modflow nwt program harbaugh 2005 niswonger et al 2011 at the two irrigated areas in koga irrigation project kudmi kebele and quashni irrigation project gayta kebele the models comprised unsaturated flow simulations using the modflow uzf package niswonger et al 2006 the fundamental forcings of the gw model infiltration and streamflow were provided by the simulations of another physically based and locally calibrated hydrological model named crest the uzf package uses the method of characteristics to solve a kinematic wave approximation to richards equation to simulate vertical 1d unsaturated flow we used the uzf package to simulate recharge using the brooks corey equation brooks and corey 1966 in the uppermost active cell based on specified maximum vertical hydraulic conductivity in the unsaturated zone this process routes infiltrated water through the unsaturated zone until it reaches the water table of the uppermost active cell niswonger et al 2006 the conceptual model was based on khadim et al 2020 in terms of aquifers and boundaries enhanced by the inclusion of a thin layer on top to add more details while simulating the vadose zone the vertical discretization used in the model is as follows from top a topsoil thickness of 6 m a gravel fractured basalt layer of 15 m followed by a fractured basalt layer of 200 m and a sedimentary formation of about 4 km thickness more details on these local scale groundwater models including model performance calibration validation initial heads and boundary conditions are all available on our previous published literature khadim et al 2020 2021 which focused on more technical applications of these models 2 3 3 irrigation releases data on irrigation releases in koga at kudmi was obtained from the abay basin authority aba since koga is a closed irrigation scheme and one of the largest irrigation projects in ethiopia spanning 7000 ha it is more regulated by administrative water managers where organized data and reporting on reservoir releases are readily available using the gw model we simulated irrigation amounts in different command areas considering the irrigation scheduling and canal layout information collected from field and the aba in gayta the quashni irrigation project is an open scheme where local people control the irrigation releases with no systematic data on irrigation being recorded we obtained irrigation data for the main canal in the quashni irrigation project during 2019 through a citizen science initiative csi rigler et al 2022 based on the observed irrigation data for 2019 and its correlation with the gayta river streamflow simulated by another hydrological model crest we estimated irrigation for other years of model operation 2 4 socio hydrological analysis we performed a series of logistic regression analyses with some of the sociological variables collected during the hh survey fig 3 shows the key steps during the analysis first we selected the dependent variables of interest namely c17 6 there was enough irrigation water in normal rainfall year c17 7 irrigation management was fair in normal year c19 1 6 during shortage of rain water for irrigation enough not enough c19 1 7 during shortage of rain irrigation was was not managed fairly c19 2 6 during too much rain the water for irrigation was enough not enough and c19 2 7 during too much rain irrigation was was not managed fairly next from a total number of 123 independent variables from the hh survey we removed the variables of high collinearity and the ones which did not justify any statistically significant association for p 0 1 in a contingency chi squared test howell 2011 next we conceptualized four social conjectures derived from our understanding of the field scale water management in the two studied villages conjecture a ca implies that farmers who need more water to sustain their agricultural well being may have lower assessments of fairness because their overreliance on water could magnify how negatively they interpret small issues with water delivery compared to other farmers conjecture b cb posits that the more resource inputs a farmer has the more they would be able to offset the challenges in water delivery and therefore less likely to interpret challenges as unfair then conjecture c cc considers that farmers more deeply involved in the irrigation governance may have high assessments of fairness because they have deeper knowledge of the underlying causes for challenges in irrigation delivery lastly conjecture d cd assumes that all else being equal wealthier farmers may be more insulated from irrigation challenges and therefore less likely to interpret irrigation issues as unfair from the 43 independent variables which passed the chi squared test we selected six independent variables to support the four social conjectures mentioned above these are famtotal total household family size c01 2 receives considers soil land condition for planting decision c01 4 considers availability of farm inputs resources for planting decision c 15 most regularly planted or most important crop planted from year to year d05 5 member leader of irrigation group and irrigland total irrigated land in timad with this we performed a logistic regression wright 1995 analysis for each of the dependent variables and the aforementioned independent variables and obtained the coefficients of logistic regression at various levels of statistical significance p 0 05 p 0 1 and p 0 1 while using the categorical variables for logistic regression dummy variables coded with either 0 for no or 1 for yes were created for crop choice variables more water intensive crops were assigned a value of 1 and the rest were assigned a 0 the logistic regression coefficients associated with the independent variable marked the expected change in logarithmic estimate of the odds of having the outcome per unit change in that independent variable the coefficients also indicated a direction of change e g whether farmers with a certain categorical answer coded 0 or 1 are more likely to be satisfied with existing water adequacy ω a or management conditions ω m the contingency chi square test and the logistic regression analysis was performed with the python programming language modules scipy virtanen et al 2020 and statsmodels seabold and perktold 2010 respectively following the regression analyses we compared the hh surveyed perceptions with gw model simulated irrigation releases and soil moisture to conduct this comparison we selected dry normal and wet years from the last decade based on a combination of climatological and sociological factors 3 results 3 1 household hh survey overview table 1 highlights the lower and higher perceptions of farmers regarding having enough irrigation water and fair irrigation management in dry and wet years respectively in the hh surveys conducted under the nsf pire initiative during the 2018 and 2019 farmers were asked whether they receive enough irrigation water in normal c17 6 dry c19 1 6 and wet c19 2 6 years and whether they think the irrigation water management was fair during normal c17 7 dry c19 1 7 and wet c19 2 7 years a total number of 172 households distributed in five villages from the two kebeles were asked on their perceptions of these variables which is summarized in table 1 here the enough water indicates the percentages of population who think that the water availability was enough and the fair management reports the percentage of population who think that the water management was fair considering geographic proximity the villages were assigned to different command areas of the koga irrigation project in kudmi in gayta however the quashni irrigation project is fairly small and no distinguished separate command areas exist as such we assigned the villages into an upstream middle and downstream location within the irrigation project area with respect to the chainage of the main irrigation canal shown in the study area from fig 2 to further investigate how statistically significant the percentages in table 1 are we performed a series of n 1 chi squared tests campbell 2007 richardson 2011 which is summarized in table 2 we found that the perceptions on fair management ω m for a dry year was significantly higher than the perceptions on water availability ω a p 0 0001 the averaged percentages of estimates for koga closed community vs gayta open community did not vary at a statistically significant level however for water management during dry years farmers perceptions in koga were significantly higher than for quashni 3 2 associations to sociological variables to see if the sociological variables are correlated with the dependent variables c17 6 c17 7 c19 1 6 c19 1 7 c19 2 6 and c19 2 7 we first tested the contingency chi square test of dependence from this analysis we removed the independent variables that do not show any statistically significant association or dependence with any of the six dependent variables e g where p value greater than 0 1 this in addition to removing variables with high collinearity reduced our selection of independent sociological variables from 123 to 43 listed in appendix a1 following the chi square test we performed six logistic regressions to assess the statistical relationship between the six dependent variables with the predictor variables which are selected in accordance with the social conjectures described in section 2 4 the variables used during logistic regression are provided in table 3 the result of the logistic regression which includes the regression coefficients and their statistical significance p value are provided in table 4 based on the logistic regression results variables that are deemed related in a statistically significant manner p 0 1 with the farmers perception of water adequacy ω a and perception of fair water management ω m are analyzed for wet normal and dry years under the different social conjectures described in section 2 4 the dependent and predictor variables considered under each social conjecture are listed in appendix table a2 first for conjecture a ca we considered that the farmers who need more water to sustain their agricultural well being may have lower assessments of fairness because their overreliance on water could magnify how negatively they interpret small issues with water delivery compared to other farmers as such we analyzed logistic regression results for each dependent variable c17 6 c17 7 c19 1 6 c19 1 7 c19 2 6 c19 2 7 with three independent variables namely c 15 most regularly planted or most important crop planted from year to year c01 2 considers soil land condition for planting decision and famtotal total household family size these three independent variables were chosen to be indicative of the argument presented in ca crop type c 15 was found to have a statistically significant p 0 1 relationship with the perception of adequacy ω a for almost all rainfall conditions the exception being dry years for the perception of fairness of water management ω m crop type is found significantly associated at p 0 05 for all years the regression coefficients were negative indicating that more water intensive crops lead to an exacerbation of the perception of inadequacy and unfairness farmers consideration of soil conditions c01 2 is negatively associated at p 0 05 statistical significance for both adequacy and fairness during dry years hence we stipulate that the more difficult the soil conditions are to be considered in terms of plant cultivation the more negative the perception is last family size as proxy for water need is found significantly associated at p 0 1 for perception of adequacy in normal and dry years the association in this case was also found negative meaning that larger families are less likely to be satisfied in terms of perception of adequacy and fairness next for conjecture b cb we used the logistic regression results of the dependent variables with the independent variables of c01 4 consideration of available farm inputs resources for planting decision and famtotal total household family size the farmers receiving input and or resources from the authorities is a proxy for availability of help and or resources the regression outcome indicated that the independent variable c01 4 is positively associated at p 0 05 for all wet and normal years for both adequacy ω a and fairness ω m as part of conjecture c cc we also considered that farmers more deeply involved in the irrigation governance may have high assessments of fairness because they have deeper knowledge of the underlying causes for challenges in irrigation delivery this led to analyzing the logistic regression outcome with one more independent variable d05 5 member leader of irrigation group the regression showed that the fact that a farmer is involved in the irrigation governance is positively associated with the perception of adequacy at p 0 1 for dry years variable c01 4 may also be related to the influence of irrigation governance and the positive odds association found at p 0 05 significance level between c01 4 and the dependent variables for wet and normal years indicated that farmers who are more involved in administrative activities may express more positive perception towards adequacy ω a and fairness ω m last for conjecture d cd we considered another independent variable irrigland total irrigated land in timad a locally used unit for area as table 4 shows the regression showed statistically significant p 0 1 association only during dry years and interestingly the association was positive meaning that the wealthier families are more likely to express positive perception on adequacy ω a and fairness ω m again the independent variable c01 4 may also be indicative of farmers wealth or socio economic status and the positive associations previously explained also support this argument 3 3 hydrological variables 3 3 1 selection of normal dry and wet years to be able to contrast the farmers perceptions with actual irrigation and soil moisture data we would need to first identify the normal dry and wet years from past observations of precipitation which controls the schedule of irrigation this was done by imposing a number of constraints in successive order first the years were chosen from the past decade because the koga irrigation project in kudmi was only built recently in 2012 and farmers are more likely to have a better recollection from the recent years next we examined a set of different hydrological estimates namely annual precipitation shown in fig 4 a only precipitation from the onset months of may and june shown in fig 4 b and the number of dry spells in different years shown in fig 4 c the latter estimate was considered because sometimes a sudden significant dry spell may damage crops and affect the farmers overall preparation in such cases farmers are more likely to label the year as a dry year regardless of the total precipitation they received during the onset or jjas months to define dry spells we employed two methods m1 having three consecutivedrydays where adryday is 0 1 mm and m2 having five consecutive days with no more than 5 mm of rainfall on any day in kudmi koga 2015 was clearly the dry year whereas in gayta quashni both 2015 and 2016 received least rainfalls however considering the onset months precipitation in may and june being substantially high in gayta in 2016 fig 4 b the year 2015 was chosen as the dry year furthermore 2017 was chosen as the normal year considering all the estimates shown in fig 4 for the wet year selection 2018 and 2014 were chosen for kudmi and gayta respectively mostly based on high precipitation and fewer number of dry spells moreover fig 5 a presents the cumulative precipitation and 5 b shows deviates from cumulative density function for different years in the two kebeles kudmi and gayta this is to further support the selection of dry normal and wet years based on hydrological estimates the cdfs shown in fig 5 a justify the selection of dry 2015 and wet 2018 and 2014 years while the deviates from average cdf shown in fig 5 b justify the selection of 2017 as the normal year 3 3 2 gw model simulated soil moisture the groundwater gw model was used to simulate the effects of irrigation in the two irrigated areas named koga in kudmi and quashni in gayta one of the primary variables simulated by the local scale models is soil moisture shown in fig 6 the figure shows an erratic fluctuation of soil moisture during the wet season which is controlled by jjas precipitation the sustained spell during the dry season from around december to may indicates the effects of irrigation in general soil moisture values fluctuate between 0 2 m3 m3 and 0 4 m3 m3 and soil moisture values in koga were slightly higher due to more clay dominance the local scale gw models were forced with actual irrigation releases in koga but modeled irrigation releases were based on a separate citizen science initiative csi in quashni more details on the local scale groundwater model and their spatiotemporally simulated hydrological variables are available at khadim et al 2020 2021 from fig 6 however a drop in soil moisture values in 2015 16 could be spotted which was the result of the recent severe drought in 2015 3 4 comparing hydrological simulations with farmers perceptions upon rationalizing the farmers perceptions and selecting the hydrologically based dry normal and wet years we compared the farmers perceptions on having enough water and a fair irrigation management with gw model simulated soil moisture shown in fig 7 and irrigation water availability ω a in different command areas irrigation reaches shown in fig 8 the farmers perceptions marked with o and x in the two figures are the same as the average percentages reported in table 1 the cumulative density plots however show gw model simulated estimates in different areas fig 7 shows a more continuous increment in simulated soil moisture while fig 8 shows a stepwise increment in irrigation the figure also shows a gradient of dry 25th percentile normal 25th 75th percentile and wet 75th percentile hydrological estimates and the horizontal centers of these bins categories were used as the x axis to plot farmers perceptions overall there was a good agreement of the gw model simulated variables with the farmers perceptions which may be visualized from figs 7 and 8 below in the two figures there is a gradual shift in increase of perceptions from dry normal and to wet years in quashni the two markers o and x are located more closely than in koga indicating a possible agreement in perceptions of having enough water which is a more tangible estimate than with the perception of having a fair irrigation management a more subjective understanding perception of management fairness in koga was more consistent 4 discussion and study limitations the socio hydrological research framework proposed in this study aims to use the physical process based groundwater model s findings to emulate farmer perceptions on irrigation fairness the latter of which was collected through hh surveys the hh surveys were summarized for different villages and mapped across different irrigation units or command areas as shown in table 1 in quashni the perceptions were found slightly higher averaging 64 enough water and 69 fair management compared to koga averaging 57 enough water and 60 fair management however this difference was not statistically significant table 2 a possible explanation for this would be that gayta is an open community where local farmers can better integrate their opinions into irrigation decision making which might have contributed to their higher satisfaction levels or positive perceptions also in gayta the perceptions varied more for normal dry wet years in contrast to kudmi where the variation is more suppressed there is an interesting takeaway from this for example in the dry year for kudmi an average of 54 households indicated a belief towards a fair irrigation management which is higher at a statistically significant level reported in table 2 than the fair management perceptions at gayta averaging 36 and enough water perception in both kebeles averaging 23 and 26 in kudmi and gayta respectively this may indicate that the in depth technical understandings of the koga reservoir levels allowed the water managers to better handle the limited resources during drought seasons and achieve a better perception from the farmers there are some additional interesting cases from table 1 in the sibhatie1 and wariho villages the sibhatie1 village in kudmi tied to koga coma1 reports a very low perception towards having enough water for irrigation during a dry year 18 however it reports a high perception of 73 towards agreeing on the water management being fair this indicates the portrayal of an improved top down communication by water managers towards the local stakeholders in underpinning the perception that limited resources were indeed managed in an optimal fashion in the wariho village from gayta kebele the perceptions for both enough water and fair management were very low during dry years 17 a similar situation prevailed in this village for other years too likely indicating the existence of other socio political factors which may contribute towards exacerbating negative perceptions while we devise strategies to improve these perceptions and eventually contribute towards reaching a more sustainable socio hydrologically driven irrigation outcome it would be useful to look into these special cases to examine other cross cutting socio hydrological factors the logistic regression results presented in section 3 2 2 provide a substantial understanding of how the farmers perceptions relate to several other factors in an attempt to rationalize opinions being driven by key socio hydrological contexts rather than randomly perceived thoughts at the same time we were interested to see if any certain response bias perturbed the farmers feedback since the hh survey records were based on farmers own perceptions the results showed some interesting relations of the dependent variables c17 6 c17 7 c19 1 6 c19 1 7 c19 2 6 and c19 2 7 with other sociological variables at different levels of significance for the decision variables during dry and normal years farmers perceptions on water adequacy were found to be negatively associated with their family size famtotal which may imply that smaller family size leads to a higher probability of being satisfied with water availability larger family size therefore works as a challenge in terms of adequate water allocation for agricultural uses in terms of farmers understanding and consideration of soil conditions c01 2 a more negative association was found during the dry years the crop choice variable c 15 was also found to be negatively associated with the dependent variables these relations support our first conjecture ca which was based on the sociological idea that farmers who are in need of more water are more likely to challenge the existing water management the independent variable c01 4 was found to be positively associated at a statistically significant level with the decision variables the variable represents farmers consideration of overall inputs and other resources to make a planting decision the variable c01 4 was relevant for three social conjectures considered in this study cb cc and cd the variable could be tied to farmers wealth and resource base to offset irrigation challenges and it could also indicate farmers involvement with other administrative groups in all conjectures this variable supports the arguments that administrative or governance involvement availability of resources and high wealth status could play a substantial role in farmers being satisfied with existing water adequacy and management conditions while the logistic regression coefficients may not indicate that the responses were substantially dominated by response bias it is worth noting that a substantial number of the coefficients were not statistically significant for example the variable d05 5 indicating farmers leadership status in irrigation groups and irrigland indicating the total amount of land owned by farmers were not found statistically significant for the logistic regression during normal and wet years for the dry years however positive associations were found indicating that farmers with improved wealth and leadership status could indeed be in favor towards the existing water adequacy and management conditions the hydrological component of this study works around using results from distributed hydrological models to better represent the climatological variables we used modflow nwt to simulate soil moisture and irrigation flow in different sections of the irrigation command areas the modflow nwt model was extensively calibrated in this study area khadim et al 2020 which takes hydrological variables from another hydrological model crest lazin et al 2020 modflow brings hydrological variables to irrigation through one way coupling while crest is the only model tuned at high resolution in this area hydrological simulation accuracies along with the spatiotemporal setting of these models rationalize our selection for this socio hydrological investigation the hydrological variables inferred through analyzing historical precipitation as well as simulated gw model estimates are presented in section 3 4 the factors that were considered in selecting the dry normal wet years are discussed in section 3 4 1 this highlights the technical or science driven considerations in shaping farmers perceptions for selection of hydrological years for example a farmer is most likely to consider a year as dry normal or wet depending on how much precipitation was received when was the onset and how many substantial dry spells occurred during the jjas time frame figs 7 and 8 highlight how the farmers perceptions eventually contrast against the gw model simulated estimates on soil moisture and water adequacy ω a both of which are somewhat indicative of the water management fairness ω m there is a gradual increase in positive perceptions from dry to wet years which follows along the cumulative density plots and provides us justification of the efficacy of the gw model to capture key public perceptions collected through an independent hh survey in the two command areas from koga which is a closed community the perceptions on fair management marked with x did not vary as substantially as in quashni an open community this may indicate that regardless of irrigation efforts farmers opinions may be subjected to their inherent preexisting perception bias which would vary depending on the system being open or closed for the three villages in quashni in gayta the two public perceptions marked with o and x are more closely located compared to koga in kudmi this indicates a better agreement between farmers assessments on having enough water for irrigation and having a fair irrigation management these aspects provide us with a clear delineation of the distinct perception patterns in open vs closed communities or pim vs top down management structures the results presented in this study are subjected to a few limitations first the hh survey results used in this study were designed and executed separately to understand a sociological baseline situation for 2018 19 in the study areas the surveyed villages were chosen separately and when we attempted to map the hh survey results with the gw model findings five villages were found to represent only the first two command areas from koga located in kudmi koga irrigation project has 12 comas in total 10 of which are located outside the kudmi kebele and are located farther from the source of the irrigation release e g the koga reservoir it would be also interesting to examine those comas considering their location and irrigation scarcity while we used the farmers perceptions on water adequacy and fair management to compare with physical hydrological models we realized the need for a longer follow up which would have helped identify and possibly reduce sociological barriers of effective irrigation by providing a better piece of socio hydrological resource another limitation of this study was the geographic uncertainty while locating farmers within certain irrigation units or command areas for example the large scale irrigation project in koga includes command areas which are extensively used for agriculture during the hh surveys the geographic coordinate information collected was for the location of farmers residence and it was not possible to find the exact coordinates or locations in which farmers practiced agriculture on a regular basis we used the theory of geographic proximity to map the surveyed farmers with individual command areas but this certainly introduced uncertainty as quite understandably all farmers from a single village may not go to the same command area the modeling performed in this study was sensitive to the use of irrigation release data which is not regularly monitored in quashni gayta this highlights an unconventional advantage of top down management approaches which render irrigation estimates that are more regulated and monitored finally the modeling estimates may be exposed to certain data propagation uncertainties which may be attributed to using simulated irrigation forcings in quashni gayta 5 conclusions and recommendations in this study we adopted a comparative and process structured socio hydrological framework to understand the efficacy of physically based groundwater models in capturing stakeholder perceptions on irrigation fairness while comparing the model simulated estimates we found interesting agreements with the independently collected hh survey data on farmers affirming to having enough irrigation water as well as opining towards a fair irrigation management using these findings the study also looks deep into analyzing key sociological aspects in select communities to underscore the factors which may affect the existing irrigation system to yield a sustainable outcome at a policy level the implementation of the proposed framework would prove to be useful in underpinning key socio hydrological strategies for emerging and economically challenged communities in future research efforts the findings and inferred understandings from this socio hydrological investigation may be used to tie along with seasonal precipitation and irrigation forecasts which may guide water managers to provide specific emphasis in certain areas while executing the irrigation water distribution and management the methodological framework of this study can be applied in other areas however it would need a thorough understanding of contemporary sociological settings as well as locally distinctive challenges from a sociological standpoint it may also be worth examining the contrasting perceptions from farmers and hence look to reach a consensus in which they may likely contemplate more the existing resources and eventually reconsider their perceptions this research maybe followed by a thorough investigation of identifying key social issues challenges and strategies for the select communities we may isolate some villages with interesting patterns of sociological perceptions and examine the other socio political constraints which may have contributed towards their perceptions the strategies either generalized or case specific could be aimed at reducing the gap between water managers decisions and farmers

1946,water management in the upper blue nile ubn region of ethiopia often entails fragmented efforts to supplement rainfed agriculture with surface water and reservoir based irrigation schemes on top of the broader climate change drought and water food insecurity issues the irrigation managers inability to accommodate farmer perceptions into sophisticated designs for resource utilization creates a fragile system from the root level driven by this the objective of this research is to carry out a socio hydrological investigation to highlight how hydrological models can be used to map farmers perception on irrigation water adequacy and water management fairness the study uses predictions from a calibrated modflow nwt groundwater gw model in two irrigated communities of ethiopia namely the koga reservoir closed community and the quashni river open community irrigation project areas farmer perceptions were studied through detailed household surveys n 172 households which were then statistically analyzed through logistic regression models under different sociological conjectures the socio hydrological investigation revealed that the local gw models were in good agreement with farmers raw perception on irrigation water adequacy and the fairness of irrigation management findings from this research would help advance our understanding in socio hydrological feedback of complex irrigation structures as well as underscoring key sociological constraints of irrigation development in emerging communities keywords sociohydrology groundwater modeling irrigation management fairness

s irrigation potential is estimated at about 3 7 million ha of which only about 5 is irrigated haile and kasa 2015 tesfaye et al 2008 in recent years there has been a policy and application level effort to invest on dry season irrigation to improve crop yield and eventually improve societal outcomes bceom 1999 chebud and melesse 2009 kebede et al 2006 nigussie et al 2019 however in most cases sociotechnical limitations play a part in reducing the effectiveness of many local irrigation projects birhanu et al 2014 khadim et al 2021 yohannes et al 2017 previously studies related to water resource management in the blue nile area of ethiopia have focused on the hydrological modeling aspects bceom 1999 conway 1997 guariso and whittington 1987 johnson and curtis 1994 kebede et al 2006 legesse et al 2004 mccartney and girma 2012 sutcliffe and parks 1987 use of physically based hydrological models to assess surface and subsurface water resources and irrigation efficacy in the upper blue nile has also been attempted in recent years asrie and sebhat 2016 chebud and melesse 2009 khadim et al 2021 2020 lazin et al 2020 in khadim et al 2021 a numerical framework was developed centering around a modflow nwt groundwater gw model to assess the potential of gw based irrigation to address water stress situations and eventually improve irrigation the study considered different irrigation management scenarios and assessed the outcome through simulating water stress a situation defined as plants receiving less water than the potential transpiration which is required to sustain their optimal physiological processes while these studies have somewhat provided assessments on the availability of hydrological resources at different scales more integrated research including existing sociological challenges and how they impact ongoing water management efforts still lacks a robust study highlighting the relevant socio hydrological aspects would therefore not only benefit the effectiveness of existing irrigation management but provide a benchmark on the holistic understanding of water and society governance scholars characterize effective communities as those with transparent decision making accountability capacity to act voice and fair grievance practices graham et al 2003 by taking the broader sociological approach to include informal practices and discourses as well we distinguish open communities which incorporate stakeholders into the decision making process and reach decisions transparently from closed communities that isolate some stakeholders from decision making irrigation management may also entail an open or closed societal structure in an open scheme local farmers traditionally incorporate their voice in irrigation management through a participatory irrigation management pim structure while in a closed scheme more top down irrigation management structures exist regardless the success of an irrigation project would best be measured in addition to economic terms by its ability to satisfy the needs of different tiers of stakeholders ayella et al 2019 in both pim and top down cases there exist a complex chain of socio technical factors namely the optimal schedule and amount of irrigation selection of crop types and fertilizers soil conditions choosing planting dates amounts of lands to irrigate etc which altogether affect the satisfaction levels of farmers the end user most irrigation initiatives often disregard this aspect of farmer satisfaction and at times when a technical or management inefficiency hinders the irrigation outcome an unhealthy environment originates at the center of existing human water relationships to map the causal relationships of such farmer satisfactions thorough socio hydrological investigations are necessary such investigations would allow us to better understand the key linkages of irrigation management with farmers perceptions on fairness of an existing system driven by this our study aims to conduct a socio hydrological investigation using estimates from a calibrated groundwater model in irrigated communities of ethiopia to assess farmer s perception on water management fairness to do so we used the responses collected through household hh surveys in 172 households from two irrigated communities within the amhara region namely the koga irrigation project in kudmi kebele closed community and the quashni irrigation project in gayta kebele open community it should be noted that even though the ministry of water irrigation and energy is the leading formal regulatory body the level of government where the state and the majority of rural ethiopians interface is the kebele tesfaye 2002 young 1998 in the hh survey farmers were asked to report their satisfaction on a whether they receive enough water for irrigation during normal dry wet years y n answers and b whether they think the irrigation management was fair y n answers specifically using the calibrated groundwater models from these irrigated communities khadim et al 2021 2020 we simulated availability of irrigation water and soil moisture for normal dry wet years in the surveyed villages and compared with farmers perceptions to identify interesting socio hydrological cases and hence improve the existing understanding of human water interactions the investigation would then entail a socio hydrological analysis of select villages to identify scope of improvement in terms of achieving a better satisfaction level from the farmers over the past decade studying socio hydrological implications of development interventions have gained pace annys 2021 perdikaki et al 2022 sivapalan et al 2012 in the study by sivapalan et al 2012 the authors introduced socio hydrology as a new science underpinning the practice of iwrm and suggested the approach s merit in predicting future irrigation improvements by considering relevant public perceptions there were three distinct pathways illustrated in sivapalan et al 2012 through which socio hydrological studies can be used to improve the efficacy of hydrological interventions these are historical socio hydrology which includes reconstructing the past cases to better understand hydrological implications comparative socio hydrology which studies human water interactions across socio economic and climate gradients to underscore differences in irrigation outcomes in different catchments peel and blöschl 2011 wagener et al 2010 and process socio hydrology which allows in depth monitoring and data collection at small scale interventions to improve case specific understandings in a participatory groundwater modeling study by perdikaki et al 2022 stakeholder consultation outcomes were used to synthesize scenarios for future groundwater management our study envelops the comparative and process socio hydrological structure discussed above and devises a framework to reinforce the sociological efficacy of existing irrigation projects this is a novel type of socio hydrological investigation which eventually attempts to spatially link physically based groundwater model findings with sociological perceptions and as such rationalize the efficacy of such models for emerging communities where existing sociological settings challenge the optimal irrigation outcome the robust methodological framework described in this study maybe applied this could be useful in specifically evaluating open vs closed irrigated communities irrigation management and eventually contemplate the success and compromises of pim vs top down approaches the results obtained in our study could also be beneficial for the local and regional stakeholders in understanding the broader science implications of irrigation interventions this could facilitate water managers in attempts to modify existing practices to better satisfy the primary end users which in this case are the farmers this improved understanding of human water relationships would allow us to highlight local irrigation management bottlenecks and help us build strategies to foster adaptive pathways that could be useful for harnessing a sustainable societal development 2 data and methods 2 1 research framework as part of the socio hydrological investigation we compared public perception on equitable water sharing obtained from the hh surveys and related it with the model findings on soil moisture estimates and irrigation availability for different command areas coma of the irrigation schemes in both koga closed community and quashni open community key steps of the investigation carried out in this study are shown in the research framework in fig 1 in the figure the processes directly addressed in this research are highlighted in solid black arrows direct actions while the processes which may take place at a later time because of the direct actions and are key aspects of the overall socio hydrological framework to improve irrigation efficacy are highlighted in dashed gray arrows fig 1 the improved understanding of the hydrological model and its ability to guide specific irrigation aspects can contribute to the optimal design of irrigation interventions which coupled with pre existing internal sociological contexts or beliefs constitute the broader resource vulnerability context the vulnerability context affects the farmers perceptions or level of satisfaction with the existing irrigation management fairness the irrigation water availability ω a in normal c17 6 dry c19 1 6 and wet c19 2 6 years and whether the farmers think the irrigation water management ω m was fair during normal c17 7 dry c19 1 7 and wet c19 2 7 years the farmer s perception reverts to developing the internal pre existing condition which again shapes up the vulnerability context furthermore these perceptions also develop long term socio cultural practices and institutional trust moreover the analysis of perceptions may lead to development of sociological strategies to offset key challenges 2 2 study area the study was conducted in two irrigated communities namely the koga irrigation project from the kudmi kebele located in the mecha woreda and the quashni irrigation project from the gayta kebele located in the dangishta woreda shown in fig 2 these areas are located in the amhara region of ethiopia and are hydrologically connected with the gilgel abay river which discharges into lake tana a freshwater shallow and oligotrophic lake at the source of the upper blue nile river wood and talling 1988 the koga irrigation project is a large scale irrigation initiative feeding about 7 000 ha of command areas khadim et al 2021 lijalem 2018 which is controlled through a top down management initiative that regulates the releases from the koga reservoir the koga reservoir is created through a dam across the koga river which used to be one of the major tributaries of the gilgel abay river the irrigation project spreads through 12 command areas one for each secondary canal where irrigation water is supplied via main secondary tertiary and quaternary canals only up to tertiary canals are shown in fig 2 this is also referred to as a closed community where local farmers are not allowed to directly incorporate their feedback on irrigation management the other area is the small scale 250 ha quashni irrigation project where the local farmers themselves operate a weir structure to divert water from the gayta river to feed the main and secondary canals this is an open community where local farmers represent key positions at the kebele administrative level and make key decisions pertaining to irrigation scheduling and specified gate openings to regulate the amounts of releases in different irrigation months 2 3 data and models 2 3 1 hh surveys as part of the nsf pire water and food security project nsf pire 2020 a detailed household hh survey was conducted in 2018 19 spanning across a total of 96 villages and 1 920 households the pire project was an international research and education partnership to promote a political institutional model of science that links sociological economic and engineering methods in a people centered approach to the human climate water agriculture energy nexus in the blue nile basin bnb ethiopia the surveys were conducted in all four communities within the project area however only two communities are irrigated and reported in this study koga and quashni furthermore the surveys included questions on administrative aspects demographics as well asset managements which could not be directly tied with irrigation adequacy and fairness the variables we are interested in c17 6 c19 1 6 c19 2 6 c17 7 c19 1 7 and c19 2 7 were only answered by a total of 172 households interviewed from the two irrigated communities and accordingly were used in this study a list of all the other sociological variables recorded in the hh surveys is shown in appendix table a1 2 3 2 groundwater model details a newton raphson formulation for unconfined subsurface flow was applied using the modflow nwt program harbaugh 2005 niswonger et al 2011 at the two irrigated areas in koga irrigation project kudmi kebele and quashni irrigation project gayta kebele the models comprised unsaturated flow simulations using the modflow uzf package niswonger et al 2006 the fundamental forcings of the gw model infiltration and streamflow were provided by the simulations of another physically based and locally calibrated hydrological model named crest the uzf package uses the method of characteristics to solve a kinematic wave approximation to richards equation to simulate vertical 1d unsaturated flow we used the uzf package to simulate recharge using the brooks corey equation brooks and corey 1966 in the uppermost active cell based on specified maximum vertical hydraulic conductivity in the unsaturated zone this process routes infiltrated water through the unsaturated zone until it reaches the water table of the uppermost active cell niswonger et al 2006 the conceptual model was based on khadim et al 2020 in terms of aquifers and boundaries enhanced by the inclusion of a thin layer on top to add more details while simulating the vadose zone the vertical discretization used in the model is as follows from top a topsoil thickness of 6 m a gravel fractured basalt layer of 15 m followed by a fractured basalt layer of 200 m and a sedimentary formation of about 4 km thickness more details on these local scale groundwater models including model performance calibration validation initial heads and boundary conditions are all available on our previous published literature khadim et al 2020 2021 which focused on more technical applications of these models 2 3 3 irrigation releases data on irrigation releases in koga at kudmi was obtained from the abay basin authority aba since koga is a closed irrigation scheme and one of the largest irrigation projects in ethiopia spanning 7000 ha it is more regulated by administrative water managers where organized data and reporting on reservoir releases are readily available using the gw model we simulated irrigation amounts in different command areas considering the irrigation scheduling and canal layout information collected from field and the aba in gayta the quashni irrigation project is an open scheme where local people control the irrigation releases with no systematic data on irrigation being recorded we obtained irrigation data for the main canal in the quashni irrigation project during 2019 through a citizen science initiative csi rigler et al 2022 based on the observed irrigation data for 2019 and its correlation with the gayta river streamflow simulated by another hydrological model crest we estimated irrigation for other years of model operation 2 4 socio hydrological analysis we performed a series of logistic regression analyses with some of the sociological variables collected during the hh survey fig 3 shows the key steps during the analysis first we selected the dependent variables of interest namely c17 6 there was enough irrigation water in normal rainfall year c17 7 irrigation management was fair in normal year c19 1 6 during shortage of rain water for irrigation enough not enough c19 1 7 during shortage of rain irrigation was was not managed fairly c19 2 6 during too much rain the water for irrigation was enough not enough and c19 2 7 during too much rain irrigation was was not managed fairly next from a total number of 123 independent variables from the hh survey we removed the variables of high collinearity and the ones which did not justify any statistically significant association for p 0 1 in a contingency chi squared test howell 2011 next we conceptualized four social conjectures derived from our understanding of the field scale water management in the two studied villages conjecture a ca implies that farmers who need more water to sustain their agricultural well being may have lower assessments of fairness because their overreliance on water could magnify how negatively they interpret small issues with water delivery compared to other farmers conjecture b cb posits that the more resource inputs a farmer has the more they would be able to offset the challenges in water delivery and therefore less likely to interpret challenges as unfair then conjecture c cc considers that farmers more deeply involved in the irrigation governance may have high assessments of fairness because they have deeper knowledge of the underlying causes for challenges in irrigation delivery lastly conjecture d cd assumes that all else being equal wealthier farmers may be more insulated from irrigation challenges and therefore less likely to interpret irrigation issues as unfair from the 43 independent variables which passed the chi squared test we selected six independent variables to support the four social conjectures mentioned above these are famtotal total household family size c01 2 receives considers soil land condition for planting decision c01 4 considers availability of farm inputs resources for planting decision c 15 most regularly planted or most important crop planted from year to year d05 5 member leader of irrigation group and irrigland total irrigated land in timad with this we performed a logistic regression wright 1995 analysis for each of the dependent variables and the aforementioned independent variables and obtained the coefficients of logistic regression at various levels of statistical significance p 0 05 p 0 1 and p 0 1 while using the categorical variables for logistic regression dummy variables coded with either 0 for no or 1 for yes were created for crop choice variables more water intensive crops were assigned a value of 1 and the rest were assigned a 0 the logistic regression coefficients associated with the independent variable marked the expected change in logarithmic estimate of the odds of having the outcome per unit change in that independent variable the coefficients also indicated a direction of change e g whether farmers with a certain categorical answer coded 0 or 1 are more likely to be satisfied with existing water adequacy ω a or management conditions ω m the contingency chi square test and the logistic regression analysis was performed with the python programming language modules scipy virtanen et al 2020 and statsmodels seabold and perktold 2010 respectively following the regression analyses we compared the hh surveyed perceptions with gw model simulated irrigation releases and soil moisture to conduct this comparison we selected dry normal and wet years from the last decade based on a combination of climatological and sociological factors 3 results 3 1 household hh survey overview table 1 highlights the lower and higher perceptions of farmers regarding having enough irrigation water and fair irrigation management in dry and wet years respectively in the hh surveys conducted under the nsf pire initiative during the 2018 and 2019 farmers were asked whether they receive enough irrigation water in normal c17 6 dry c19 1 6 and wet c19 2 6 years and whether they think the irrigation water management was fair during normal c17 7 dry c19 1 7 and wet c19 2 7 years a total number of 172 households distributed in five villages from the two kebeles were asked on their perceptions of these variables which is summarized in table 1 here the enough water indicates the percentages of population who think that the water availability was enough and the fair management reports the percentage of population who think that the water management was fair considering geographic proximity the villages were assigned to different command areas of the koga irrigation project in kudmi in gayta however the quashni irrigation project is fairly small and no distinguished separate command areas exist as such we assigned the villages into an upstream middle and downstream location within the irrigation project area with respect to the chainage of the main irrigation canal shown in the study area from fig 2 to further investigate how statistically significant the percentages in table 1 are we performed a series of n 1 chi squared tests campbell 2007 richardson 2011 which is summarized in table 2 we found that the perceptions on fair management ω m for a dry year was significantly higher than the perceptions on water availability ω a p 0 0001 the averaged percentages of estimates for koga closed community vs gayta open community did not vary at a statistically significant level however for water management during dry years farmers perceptions in koga were significantly higher than for quashni 3 2 associations to sociological variables to see if the sociological variables are correlated with the dependent variables c17 6 c17 7 c19 1 6 c19 1 7 c19 2 6 and c19 2 7 we first tested the contingency chi square test of dependence from this analysis we removed the independent variables that do not show any statistically significant association or dependence with any of the six dependent variables e g where p value greater than 0 1 this in addition to removing variables with high collinearity reduced our selection of independent sociological variables from 123 to 43 listed in appendix a1 following the chi square test we performed six logistic regressions to assess the statistical relationship between the six dependent variables with the predictor variables which are selected in accordance with the social conjectures described in section 2 4 the variables used during logistic regression are provided in table 3 the result of the logistic regression which includes the regression coefficients and their statistical significance p value are provided in table 4 based on the logistic regression results variables that are deemed related in a statistically significant manner p 0 1 with the farmers perception of water adequacy ω a and perception of fair water management ω m are analyzed for wet normal and dry years under the different social conjectures described in section 2 4 the dependent and predictor variables considered under each social conjecture are listed in appendix table a2 first for conjecture a ca we considered that the farmers who need more water to sustain their agricultural well being may have lower assessments of fairness because their overreliance on water could magnify how negatively they interpret small issues with water delivery compared to other farmers as such we analyzed logistic regression results for each dependent variable c17 6 c17 7 c19 1 6 c19 1 7 c19 2 6 c19 2 7 with three independent variables namely c 15 most regularly planted or most important crop planted from year to year c01 2 considers soil land condition for planting decision and famtotal total household family size these three independent variables were chosen to be indicative of the argument presented in ca crop type c 15 was found to have a statistically significant p 0 1 relationship with the perception of adequacy ω a for almost all rainfall conditions the exception being dry years for the perception of fairness of water management ω m crop type is found significantly associated at p 0 05 for all years the regression coefficients were negative indicating that more water intensive crops lead to an exacerbation of the perception of inadequacy and unfairness farmers consideration of soil conditions c01 2 is negatively associated at p 0 05 statistical significance for both adequacy and fairness during dry years hence we stipulate that the more difficult the soil conditions are to be considered in terms of plant cultivation the more negative the perception is last family size as proxy for water need is found significantly associated at p 0 1 for perception of adequacy in normal and dry years the association in this case was also found negative meaning that larger families are less likely to be satisfied in terms of perception of adequacy and fairness next for conjecture b cb we used the logistic regression results of the dependent variables with the independent variables of c01 4 consideration of available farm inputs resources for planting decision and famtotal total household family size the farmers receiving input and or resources from the authorities is a proxy for availability of help and or resources the regression outcome indicated that the independent variable c01 4 is positively associated at p 0 05 for all wet and normal years for both adequacy ω a and fairness ω m as part of conjecture c cc we also considered that farmers more deeply involved in the irrigation governance may have high assessments of fairness because they have deeper knowledge of the underlying causes for challenges in irrigation delivery this led to analyzing the logistic regression outcome with one more independent variable d05 5 member leader of irrigation group the regression showed that the fact that a farmer is involved in the irrigation governance is positively associated with the perception of adequacy at p 0 1 for dry years variable c01 4 may also be related to the influence of irrigation governance and the positive odds association found at p 0 05 significance level between c01 4 and the dependent variables for wet and normal years indicated that farmers who are more involved in administrative activities may express more positive perception towards adequacy ω a and fairness ω m last for conjecture d cd we considered another independent variable irrigland total irrigated land in timad a locally used unit for area as table 4 shows the regression showed statistically significant p 0 1 association only during dry years and interestingly the association was positive meaning that the wealthier families are more likely to express positive perception on adequacy ω a and fairness ω m again the independent variable c01 4 may also be indicative of farmers wealth or socio economic status and the positive associations previously explained also support this argument 3 3 hydrological variables 3 3 1 selection of normal dry and wet years to be able to contrast the farmers perceptions with actual irrigation and soil moisture data we would need to first identify the normal dry and wet years from past observations of precipitation which controls the schedule of irrigation this was done by imposing a number of constraints in successive order first the years were chosen from the past decade because the koga irrigation project in kudmi was only built recently in 2012 and farmers are more likely to have a better recollection from the recent years next we examined a set of different hydrological estimates namely annual precipitation shown in fig 4 a only precipitation from the onset months of may and june shown in fig 4 b and the number of dry spells in different years shown in fig 4 c the latter estimate was considered because sometimes a sudden significant dry spell may damage crops and affect the farmers overall preparation in such cases farmers are more likely to label the year as a dry year regardless of the total precipitation they received during the onset or jjas months to define dry spells we employed two methods m1 having three consecutivedrydays where adryday is 0 1 mm and m2 having five consecutive days with no more than 5 mm of rainfall on any day in kudmi koga 2015 was clearly the dry year whereas in gayta quashni both 2015 and 2016 received least rainfalls however considering the onset months precipitation in may and june being substantially high in gayta in 2016 fig 4 b the year 2015 was chosen as the dry year furthermore 2017 was chosen as the normal year considering all the estimates shown in fig 4 for the wet year selection 2018 and 2014 were chosen for kudmi and gayta respectively mostly based on high precipitation and fewer number of dry spells moreover fig 5 a presents the cumulative precipitation and 5 b shows deviates from cumulative density function for different years in the two kebeles kudmi and gayta this is to further support the selection of dry normal and wet years based on hydrological estimates the cdfs shown in fig 5 a justify the selection of dry 2015 and wet 2018 and 2014 years while the deviates from average cdf shown in fig 5 b justify the selection of 2017 as the normal year 3 3 2 gw model simulated soil moisture the groundwater gw model was used to simulate the effects of irrigation in the two irrigated areas named koga in kudmi and quashni in gayta one of the primary variables simulated by the local scale models is soil moisture shown in fig 6 the figure shows an erratic fluctuation of soil moisture during the wet season which is controlled by jjas precipitation the sustained spell during the dry season from around december to may indicates the effects of irrigation in general soil moisture values fluctuate between 0 2 m3 m3 and 0 4 m3 m3 and soil moisture values in koga were slightly higher due to more clay dominance the local scale gw models were forced with actual irrigation releases in koga but modeled irrigation releases were based on a separate citizen science initiative csi in quashni more details on the local scale groundwater model and their spatiotemporally simulated hydrological variables are available at khadim et al 2020 2021 from fig 6 however a drop in soil moisture values in 2015 16 could be spotted which was the result of the recent severe drought in 2015 3 4 comparing hydrological simulations with farmers perceptions upon rationalizing the farmers perceptions and selecting the hydrologically based dry normal and wet years we compared the farmers perceptions on having enough water and a fair irrigation management with gw model simulated soil moisture shown in fig 7 and irrigation water availability ω a in different command areas irrigation reaches shown in fig 8 the farmers perceptions marked with o and x in the two figures are the same as the average percentages reported in table 1 the cumulative density plots however show gw model simulated estimates in different areas fig 7 shows a more continuous increment in simulated soil moisture while fig 8 shows a stepwise increment in irrigation the figure also shows a gradient of dry 25th percentile normal 25th 75th percentile and wet 75th percentile hydrological estimates and the horizontal centers of these bins categories were used as the x axis to plot farmers perceptions overall there was a good agreement of the gw model simulated variables with the farmers perceptions which may be visualized from figs 7 and 8 below in the two figures there is a gradual shift in increase of perceptions from dry normal and to wet years in quashni the two markers o and x are located more closely than in koga indicating a possible agreement in perceptions of having enough water which is a more tangible estimate than with the perception of having a fair irrigation management a more subjective understanding perception of management fairness in koga was more consistent 4 discussion and study limitations the socio hydrological research framework proposed in this study aims to use the physical process based groundwater model s findings to emulate farmer perceptions on irrigation fairness the latter of which was collected through hh surveys the hh surveys were summarized for different villages and mapped across different irrigation units or command areas as shown in table 1 in quashni the perceptions were found slightly higher averaging 64 enough water and 69 fair management compared to koga averaging 57 enough water and 60 fair management however this difference was not statistically significant table 2 a possible explanation for this would be that gayta is an open community where local farmers can better integrate their opinions into irrigation decision making which might have contributed to their higher satisfaction levels or positive perceptions also in gayta the perceptions varied more for normal dry wet years in contrast to kudmi where the variation is more suppressed there is an interesting takeaway from this for example in the dry year for kudmi an average of 54 households indicated a belief towards a fair irrigation management which is higher at a statistically significant level reported in table 2 than the fair management perceptions at gayta averaging 36 and enough water perception in both kebeles averaging 23 and 26 in kudmi and gayta respectively this may indicate that the in depth technical understandings of the koga reservoir levels allowed the water managers to better handle the limited resources during drought seasons and achieve a better perception from the farmers there are some additional interesting cases from table 1 in the sibhatie1 and wariho villages the sibhatie1 village in kudmi tied to koga coma1 reports a very low perception towards having enough water for irrigation during a dry year 18 however it reports a high perception of 73 towards agreeing on the water management being fair this indicates the portrayal of an improved top down communication by water managers towards the local stakeholders in underpinning the perception that limited resources were indeed managed in an optimal fashion in the wariho village from gayta kebele the perceptions for both enough water and fair management were very low during dry years 17 a similar situation prevailed in this village for other years too likely indicating the existence of other socio political factors which may contribute towards exacerbating negative perceptions while we devise strategies to improve these perceptions and eventually contribute towards reaching a more sustainable socio hydrologically driven irrigation outcome it would be useful to look into these special cases to examine other cross cutting socio hydrological factors the logistic regression results presented in section 3 2 2 provide a substantial understanding of how the farmers perceptions relate to several other factors in an attempt to rationalize opinions being driven by key socio hydrological contexts rather than randomly perceived thoughts at the same time we were interested to see if any certain response bias perturbed the farmers feedback since the hh survey records were based on farmers own perceptions the results showed some interesting relations of the dependent variables c17 6 c17 7 c19 1 6 c19 1 7 c19 2 6 and c19 2 7 with other sociological variables at different levels of significance for the decision variables during dry and normal years farmers perceptions on water adequacy were found to be negatively associated with their family size famtotal which may imply that smaller family size leads to a higher probability of being satisfied with water availability larger family size therefore works as a challenge in terms of adequate water allocation for agricultural uses in terms of farmers understanding and consideration of soil conditions c01 2 a more negative association was found during the dry years the crop choice variable c 15 was also found to be negatively associated with the dependent variables these relations support our first conjecture ca which was based on the sociological idea that farmers who are in need of more water are more likely to challenge the existing water management the independent variable c01 4 was found to be positively associated at a statistically significant level with the decision variables the variable represents farmers consideration of overall inputs and other resources to make a planting decision the variable c01 4 was relevant for three social conjectures considered in this study cb cc and cd the variable could be tied to farmers wealth and resource base to offset irrigation challenges and it could also indicate farmers involvement with other administrative groups in all conjectures this variable supports the arguments that administrative or governance involvement availability of resources and high wealth status could play a substantial role in farmers being satisfied with existing water adequacy and management conditions while the logistic regression coefficients may not indicate that the responses were substantially dominated by response bias it is worth noting that a substantial number of the coefficients were not statistically significant for example the variable d05 5 indicating farmers leadership status in irrigation groups and irrigland indicating the total amount of land owned by farmers were not found statistically significant for the logistic regression during normal and wet years for the dry years however positive associations were found indicating that farmers with improved wealth and leadership status could indeed be in favor towards the existing water adequacy and management conditions the hydrological component of this study works around using results from distributed hydrological models to better represent the climatological variables we used modflow nwt to simulate soil moisture and irrigation flow in different sections of the irrigation command areas the modflow nwt model was extensively calibrated in this study area khadim et al 2020 which takes hydrological variables from another hydrological model crest lazin et al 2020 modflow brings hydrological variables to irrigation through one way coupling while crest is the only model tuned at high resolution in this area hydrological simulation accuracies along with the spatiotemporal setting of these models rationalize our selection for this socio hydrological investigation the hydrological variables inferred through analyzing historical precipitation as well as simulated gw model estimates are presented in section 3 4 the factors that were considered in selecting the dry normal wet years are discussed in section 3 4 1 this highlights the technical or science driven considerations in shaping farmers perceptions for selection of hydrological years for example a farmer is most likely to consider a year as dry normal or wet depending on how much precipitation was received when was the onset and how many substantial dry spells occurred during the jjas time frame figs 7 and 8 highlight how the farmers perceptions eventually contrast against the gw model simulated estimates on soil moisture and water adequacy ω a both of which are somewhat indicative of the water management fairness ω m there is a gradual increase in positive perceptions from dry to wet years which follows along the cumulative density plots and provides us justification of the efficacy of the gw model to capture key public perceptions collected through an independent hh survey in the two command areas from koga which is a closed community the perceptions on fair management marked with x did not vary as substantially as in quashni an open community this may indicate that regardless of irrigation efforts farmers opinions may be subjected to their inherent preexisting perception bias which would vary depending on the system being open or closed for the three villages in quashni in gayta the two public perceptions marked with o and x are more closely located compared to koga in kudmi this indicates a better agreement between farmers assessments on having enough water for irrigation and having a fair irrigation management these aspects provide us with a clear delineation of the distinct perception patterns in open vs closed communities or pim vs top down management structures the results presented in this study are subjected to a few limitations first the hh survey results used in this study were designed and executed separately to understand a sociological baseline situation for 2018 19 in the study areas the surveyed villages were chosen separately and when we attempted to map the hh survey results with the gw model findings five villages were found to represent only the first two command areas from koga located in kudmi koga irrigation project has 12 comas in total 10 of which are located outside the kudmi kebele and are located farther from the source of the irrigation release e g the koga reservoir it would be also interesting to examine those comas considering their location and irrigation scarcity while we used the farmers perceptions on water adequacy and fair management to compare with physical hydrological models we realized the need for a longer follow up which would have helped identify and possibly reduce sociological barriers of effective irrigation by providing a better piece of socio hydrological resource another limitation of this study was the geographic uncertainty while locating farmers within certain irrigation units or command areas for example the large scale irrigation project in koga includes command areas which are extensively used for agriculture during the hh surveys the geographic coordinate information collected was for the location of farmers residence and it was not possible to find the exact coordinates or locations in which farmers practiced agriculture on a regular basis we used the theory of geographic proximity to map the surveyed farmers with individual command areas but this certainly introduced uncertainty as quite understandably all farmers from a single village may not go to the same command area the modeling performed in this study was sensitive to the use of irrigation release data which is not regularly monitored in quashni gayta this highlights an unconventional advantage of top down management approaches which render irrigation estimates that are more regulated and monitored finally the modeling estimates may be exposed to certain data propagation uncertainties which may be attributed to using simulated irrigation forcings in quashni gayta 5 conclusions and recommendations in this study we adopted a comparative and process structured socio hydrological framework to understand the efficacy of physically based groundwater models in capturing stakeholder perceptions on irrigation fairness while comparing the model simulated estimates we found interesting agreements with the independently collected hh survey data on farmers affirming to having enough irrigation water as well as opining towards a fair irrigation management using these findings the study also looks deep into analyzing key sociological aspects in select communities to underscore the factors which may affect the existing irrigation system to yield a sustainable outcome at a policy level the implementation of the proposed framework would prove to be useful in underpinning key socio hydrological strategies for emerging and economically challenged communities in future research efforts the findings and inferred understandings from this socio hydrological investigation may be used to tie along with seasonal precipitation and irrigation forecasts which may guide water managers to provide specific emphasis in certain areas while executing the irrigation water distribution and management the methodological framework of this study can be applied in other areas however it would need a thorough understanding of contemporary sociological settings as well as locally distinctive challenges from a sociological standpoint it may also be worth examining the contrasting perceptions from farmers and hence look to reach a consensus in which they may likely contemplate more the existing resources and eventually reconsider their perceptions this research maybe followed by a thorough investigation of identifying key social issues challenges and strategies for the select communities we may isolate some villages with interesting patterns of sociological perceptions and examine the other socio political constraints which may have contributed towards their perceptions the strategies either generalized or case specific could be aimed at reducing the gap between water managers decisions and farmers

al 2020 randazzo et al 2021 zhang et al 2022 the india asia continental collision since the early cenozoic created one of the earth s most tectonically active regions the tibetan plateau and its surroundings where earthquakes exert high threats on densely populated settlements near large active fault zones zhang et al 2010 the eastern tibetan plateau is characterized by a y shape active fault system fig 1 which consists of the yushu ganzi xianshuihe fault system ygxfs in the northwest the longmenshan fault system lmfs in the northeast and the anninghe fault system anfs in the southeast wu and gao 2019 these active thrusts and strike slip faults have accommodated crustal shortening and extrusion since at least the mid miocene time tapponnier et al 2001 hubbard and shaw 2009 cook et al

caracausi et al 2022 however few studies have explored the correlations between tectonic degassing and seismogenesis for the active fault systems dominated by growth of orogenic plateaux previous studies on gas geochemistry in the eastern and southeastern tibetan plateau generally focused on volatile origin and co2 emissions and were lack of interpretation on seismogenic processes through a comparison of tectonic degassing between thrust i e lmfs and strike slip fault i e ygxfs and anfs systems e g zhang et al 2021a xu et al 2022 wang et al 2023 recent work by liu et al 2022 based on hydrochemistry of thermal waters interpreted the spatial distribution of earthquakes along the ygxfs through the heterogeneity of crustal thermal structure related to fluid circulation but still the degassing of deeply derived fluids is yet to be constrained for evaluating the role of uprising fluids in seismogenesis here we present a quantitative study on the degassing of hydrothermal gases from the y shaped active fault system in eastern tibetan plateau fig 1 using the he co2 elemental and isotopic systematics e g 3he 4he and δ13cco2 of the bubbling gases from thermal springs we quantitatively constrain i the origin of deeply derived fluids and the involved physico chemical processes during source to surface fluid transport in the y shaped active fault system and ii the upward flow rates of mantle fluids and the he and co2 fluxes combined with constraints from geological geophysical and seismic studies we try to delineate the controlling factors for tectonic degassing from thrust and strike slip fault systems and further evaluate the potential role of deeply derived fluids in seismogenic processes finally a genetic model is proposed for the subsurface fluid origin and transport in which the uprising of co2 rich fluids may facilitate overpressure involved in earthquake triggering of the y shaped active fault system 2 geological setting 2 1 the y shaped active fault system the ne striking lmfs is about 500 km long 40 50 km wide and comprises a series of generally nw dipping thrust faults which are characterized by vertical slip rates of 1 mm yr and right lateral slip rates of 2 3 mm yr zhang et al 2010 this fault system defines the eastern margin of the tibetan plateau and connects with the ygxfs and anfs in its southwestern end fig 1 the lmfs is well known for the 2008 mw 7 9 wenchuan earthquake that occurred as a result of the oblique convergence between the songpan ganzi block and the sichuan basin hubbard and shaw 2009 rock units along the lmfs are composed of paleozoic mesozoic flysch formations and carbonate with volcanic rocks the ygxfs is an arcuate left lateral strike slip fault system with a length of 800 km which can be divided into the yushu ganzi fault in the northwest and the xianshuihe fault in the southeast fig 1 liu et al 2022 it dips 80 and has left lateral slip rates of about 10 mm yr bai et al 2021 and references therein recent major earthquakes along the ygxfs include the 2010 mw 7 1 yushu earthquake 2014 mw 6 3 kangding earthquake and 2022 ms 6 8 luding earthquake as shown in fig 1 the ygxfs transects triassic sedimentary rocks and volcanic rocks and is locally intruded by meso cenozoic plutons to the south the ygxfs links to the anfs near shimian the 160 km long anfs was generated by ns trending faulting processes initiated in the miocene fig 1 wang et al 2021a based on geological offset and geodetic data for the anfs the estimated quaternary sinistral slip rates are 6 5 1 mm yr shan et al 2013 and references therein the anfs is seismically active as shown by the 1952 mw 6 7 mianning earthquake shan et al 2013 it consists of several parallel strands and passes through complex precambrian to mesozoic rock units including quartzite marble dolostone metasandstone and basic to acidic volcanic rocks fig 1 2 2 a focal zone of orogenic plateau expansion tectonically the y shaped active fault system represents boundary faults of the eastern tibetan plateau that recorded lateral growth via fold and thrust structures i e lmfs hubbard and shaw 2009 and strike slip faults i e ygxfs and anfs tapponnier et al 2001 respectively under the context of the orogenic plateau expansion there are a lot of hydrothermal manifestations fig 1 and densely distributed earthquakes in the y shaped active fault system zhang et al 2010 bai et al 2021 this focal zone of orogenic plateau growth significantly influenced the motion of crustal blocks and regional tectonic evolution clark and royden 2000 the eastern margin of the tibetan plateau along the lmfs is characterized by a steep topographic relief significant crustal deformation occurred mainly by convergence perpendicular to the lmfs right lateral shear and vertical movement hubbard and shaw 2009 resulting in a strain energy conveyor belt that continuously transfers its deformation into accumulating stress on the lmfs zhang et al 2010 the ongoing stage of southeastward expansion of the tibetan plateau can be traced back to the initiation ages of active fault systems probably in the mid to late miocene tapponnier et al 2001 cook et al 2018 as represented by the ygxfs the most notable feature of the ygxsf is the bend segment near the axis zone of the y shaped active fault system fig 1 which is an enhanced fault failure structure due to disrupted slip transfer the bend segment of the ygxfs is characterized by miocene to pliocene 14 5 ma searle et al 2016 emplacement of the gongga shan batholith with possibly synchronous tectonics of secondary fault segments bai et al 2021 3 samples and methods hydrothermal manifestations along the y shaped active fault system mainly include hot springs boiling springs

elucidate the correlations between tectonic degassing and regional seismicity we collected 46 gas samples from 24 thermal springs using low he diffusivity glass vessels during a field campaign in 2020

temperatures see details in zhang et al 2022 the results were then used in a one dimensional steady state advection model which was proposed for the transport of mantle fluids through the continental

mantle he degassing as suggested by the wide range of 0 03 2 73 ra this study and xu et al 2022 fig s2a in supplementary material notably the 3he 4he ratios along the nw segment of the ygxfs 0 03 0 62

have a wide range of 17 3 to 5 2 in addition the δ13cch4 values of 49 0 to 18 1 are close to those of thermogenic gases liu et al 2019 but show no spatial variations our samples have co2 3he ratios 2 0 108 to 2 4 1012 ranging over 4 orders of magnitude table s2 in supplementary material with n2 or ch4 rich gases characterized by lower co2 3he ratios than typical mantle value 2 109 sano and marty 1995 as more commonly observed in the anfs and lmfs fig s2c in supplementary material 5 discussion 5 1 helium inventory and spatial variations helium isotopes have been widely used to identify the sources of deeply derived fluids in different geotectonic settings 4he is mainly produced by the radioactive decay of u and th elements whereas 3he has primordial tritiogenic and nucleogenic sources ozima and podosek 2002 therefore the relative contributions of different helium sources to hydrothermal fluids must be constrained 3he originating from the decay of tritium 3h β 3he and neutron reaction of 6li in aquifer rocks 6li n ɑ 3h β 3he has been estimated to be insignificant in the eastern tibetan plateau due to low tritium concentrations in thermal waters and low production rate of in situ nucleogenic 3he xu et al 2022 therefore the binary mixing between crustal 3he 4he 0 02 ra ballentine et al 2002 and mantle he is plausible notably there is no evidence for the presence of metasomatized sub continental lithospheric mantle beneath the study area for simplicity the morb type upper mantle 3he 4he 8 1 ra graham 2002 is considered in the calculation of total he inventory of the hydrothermal gases as shown in fig 2 all the lmfs samples are dominated by purely crustal radiogenic he and similarly the anfs samples have mantle he contributions lower than 1 in contrast mantle he contributions to hydrothermal gases along the ygxfs vary from 0 14 to 34 with samples from its bend segment characterized by much higher mantle he proportions 11 34 than those observed along its nw segment fig 2 in particular the highest 3he 4he 2 73 ra xu et al 2022 along the ygxfs is slightly higher or comparable to the maximum 3he 4he 2 24 ra of the karakoram fault in the western tibetan plateau klemperer et al 2013 moreover there is no evidence for recent mantle derived magmatism for our study area paleozoic mantle derived pegmatite dikes occur sporadically along the ygxfs and its adjacent areas and cannot explain the mantle he signature in hydrothermal gases xu et al 2022 taking into account all the 3he 4he data of hydrothermal gases from the tibetan plateau and surrounding regions zhang et al 2021a klemperer et al 2022 the hydrothermal gases released from active faults have mantle he proportions significantly lower than those of the quaternary volcanic fields 3he 4he 5 ra zhang et al 2021b mantle he is most efficiently transferred by the mantle derived melt intrusion through volcanism magmatism into the crust in comparison with diffusion through solid mantle that is extremely slow ballentine et al 2002 therefore the above feature can be ascribed to potential differences in the efficiency of mantle he transport through the continental crust between non volcanic and volcanic regions moreover the large 3he 4he variabilities are also observed in the representative active faults worldwide fig 2 showing variable degrees of mantle he dilution by crustal he due to fault dependent permeability extension lithology and the earthquake magnitude kennedy et al 1997 crossey et al 2016 zhang et al 2021a caracausi et al 2022 geophysical observations suggested abrupt changes in moho topography beneath the axis zone of the y shaped tectonic syntaxis liu et al 2014 which may represent the deep tectonic responses of the lateral expansion of the eastern tibetan plateau fig 3 a and can influence the upwelling of mantle heat flow along the fault system wang et al 2019 for the kangding moxi region along the bend segment of the ygxfs fig 3b the deep heat may originate from partial melts of the mantle either lithospheric mantle or upwelling asthenosphere as suggested by the existence of a low velocity zone at 70 km depth beneath this region li et al 2016 and asthenospheric upwelling huang et al 2019 wang et al 2021c the lowest s wave velocity zone corresponds well to the high 3he 4he anomaly located in the intersection region of lmfs ygxfs and anfs i e the axis zone of the y shaped active fault system fig 3 similarly a strong correlation between mantle he anomalies and domains with low seismic velocity and low density within the upper mantle was reported for the western usa crossey et al 2016 the efficient mantle he degassing along the bend segment of the ygxfs may reflect incipient melting of the lithospheric mantle or upwelling asthenospheric mantle as observed from a tectonically active lithospheric scale faults such as the karakoram fault in the western tibetan plateau klemperer et al 2013 in particular the hydrothermal 3he 4he ratios gradually decrease in mantle he inputs towards the ne nw and se branches of the y shaped active fault system fig 3b he isotope variations are associated with crustal he degassing from dilatancy and fracturation of rocks which have been recognized in seismically active fault zones including san andreas fault in usa futagawa hinagu fault in japan anatolian fault in turkey irpinia fault in italy sano et al 2016 caracausi et al 2022 and therein references such regional he degassing patterns can be explained by the dilution effects due to the increasing addition of crustal he into mantle he towards the branching fault segments i e increasing transport distances in the crust for mantle fluids originating from 70 km depth beneath the axis fault zone fig 3b alternatively a predominant crustal he source is also plausible for hydrothermal gases released from the lmfs and anfs if not considering the case of deep fault networks connecting with the axis zone where mantle fluids are concentrated 5 2 carbon inventory and he co2 systematics the deeply derived volatiles mainly co2 generally serve as the carrier gases for helium transport through fault zones and fractures lee et al 2019 and references therein in this study we use a ternary mixing model based on he co2 systematics proposed by sano and marty 1995 to quantify the relative proportions of potential contributions from the mantle m carbonate car and organic matter org to the total co2 inventory fig 4 a the equations are as follows 13c 12c obs f m 13c 12c m f car 13c 12c car f org 13c 12c org 1 12c 3he obs f m 12c 3he m f car 12c 3he car f org 12c 3he org f m f car f org 1 where subscripts obs m car and org refer to the observed value of the sample mantle carbonate rocks and organic sediments respectively most samples along the ygxfs fall into the mixing area bounded by the m car and org end members indicating limited he co2 fractionation and the validity of ternary mixing model in quantifying the total co2 inventory crustal carbon is dominant in most cases of the y shaped active fault system car org 90 table s2 in supplementary material while proportions of mantle carbon are much lower 0 1 4 4 specifically carbonate contribution is more significant 75 than organic matter in the carbon inventory in addition a mass balance model based on dic dissolved inorganic carbon contents and δ13cdic within thermal waters along the ygxfs revealed a dominant deep co2 origin by metamorphic decarbonization liu et al 2022 which is supported by δ14cdic values 977 to 909 of the thermal waters showing origin with affinity to dead carbon δ14c 1000 in metamorphic fluids xu et al 2022 zhong et al 2022 it should be noted that the results of the ternary mixing model in sano and marty 1995 may be influenced by the fractionation of the he co2 systematics for example the negative correlation between co2 3he and he concentrations defined by the ygxfs samples fig 4b suggests the preferential loss of he relative to co2 from the thermal waters which accounts for the increasing co2 3he ratios with decreasing he concentrations in contrast to the ygxfs most samples along the lmfs and anfs fall outside the mixing curves fig 4a suggesting that their δ13cco2 values and co2 3he ratios have been substantially modified due to secondary processes such as co2 removal by precipitation of calcite in thermal waters barry et al 2020 this possibility is supported by the temperature dependent reactions between co2 rich fluids with ca2 na and mg2 ions in thermal waters liu et al 2022 xu et al 2022 which form carbonate minerals and lead to lower co2 3he and more negative δ13c values of the residual phase to evaluate the effects of calcite precipitation on he co2 systematics we employ a calcite fractionation model proposed by barry et al 2020 in fig 4a most lmfs and anfs samples lie within the expected calcite fractionation trends at 50 c and 192 c another possibility for low co2 3he ratios of some n2 dominated samples is different degrees of co2 dissolution due to preferential dissolution of co2 in water relative to less soluble n2 during gas water interaction randazzo et al 2021 randazzo et al 2022 notably more information on n2 origin requires further study on n isotope systematics for n2 dominated gases although the carbon inventory of the lmfs and anfs samples cannot be calculated from the ternary mixing model a dominant crustal co2 source is possible as suggested by their crust dominated he inventory a crustal carbon source is also supported by δ13cch4 values 47 5 to 47 1 of some ch4 rich samples which point to the thermogenic decomposition of organic carbon components in the crust 5 3 deeply derived he and co2 fluxes mantle components in the thermal springs along the ygxfs indicate that the strike slip fault system provides a conduit for mantle derived fluids into the crustal fluid systems similar to active fault zones such as the san andreas fault kennedy et al 1997 kulongoski et al 2013 the variability of 3he 4he ratios along the faults depends on the upward flow rates of mantle fluids and the addition of radiogenic 4he during transfer through the crust kulongoski et al 2013 according to the helium transport model kennedy et al 1997 we estimated the upward flow rates of mantle he q through the ygxfs assuming a crustal thickness hcrust of 60 km q h crust ρ r p h e ρ f h e f m r s r c r m r s where ρr and ρf refer to the densities of the solid and fluid phase respectively p he is the 4he production rate from u and th in the rocks he f m is the initial mantle fluid 4he concentration rs rc and rm are the 3he 4he ratio of sample crust and mantle 4he production rate is calculated using the following equation p he ρr 1 19 10 13 u 2 88 10 14 th 1 ø ø where u and th are the contents of u and th in the rocks ø is bulk rock porosity further details e g physico chemical parameters and 4he concentrations in thermal waters about the calculation and results are given in table s4 in supplementary material the calculated upward flow rates along the ygxfs vary between 30 and 1797 mm yr table s4 in supplementary material in particular the ygxfs bend segment tends to have high mantle fluid flow rates 794 1797 mm yr except for sample ck02 table s4 in supplementary material which are relatively close to those estimated for the alpine fault 420 2600 mm yr menzies et al 2016 but significantly higher than the san andreas fault 0 4 140 mm yr kennedy et al 1997 kulongoski et al 2013 north anatolian fault 130 190 mm yr de leeuw et al 2010 and karakoram fault 12 19 mm yr klemperer et al 2013 the high 3he 4he ratios observed along the ygxfs require a rapid transfer of mantle fluids to the surface and high permeability of the fault system following the steady state upward fluid flow model kennedy et al 1997 the estimated residence time of mantle fluids would range from 0 04 to 6 ma if considering a crustal thickness of 60 km in this region based on the flow rates of mantle he the total 3he flux can be estimated using a simple equation from kulongoski et al 2013 h 3 e f l u x q ρ f h e s r s where q is the calculated upward fluid flow rate ρf is the densities of the fluid hes is the 4he concentrations of spring waters and rs is the 3he 4he ratio of samples the total 3he fluxes of thermal springs along the ygxfs have a range of 5 39 10 7 to 3 61 10 5 mol km2 yr or 1 03 104 to 6 90 105 atoms m2 s table s4 in supplementary material these results are markedly higher than 3he flux from stable continental crust 102 atoms m2 s ozima and podosek 2002 and are similar to values in central sicily 1 8 104 to 7 7 104 atoms m2 s caracausi and sulli 2019 and tectonically active continental areas 105 atoms m2 s ozima and podosek 2002 assuming co2 3he ratio of 2 109 for mantle fluids the estimated mantle co2 flux of the ygxfs would range from 1 08 103 to 7 23 104 mol km2 yr these values are lower than those of active and dormant volcanic systems worldwide and the african rift system but in good agreement with active fault system in continental region without recent volcanism such as san andreas fault 4 0 104 mol km2 yr kulongoski et al 2013 and sicily fold and thrust belt 1 8 103 to 8 2 103 mol km2 yr caracausi and sulli 2019 in particular we note that the bend segment of the ygxfs i e axis zone of the y shaped active fault system is characterized by average mantle co2 flux 4 58 104 mol km2 yr over 10 times higher than that of its nw segment 2 62 103 mol km2 yr if scaling these average mantle co2 fluxes to the bend segment length 250 km width 20 km and the nw segment length 650 km width 10 km the mantle co2 flux would be 2 29 108 mol yr for the bend segment and 1 70 107 mol yr for the nw segment yielding a total mantle co2 flux of 2 46 108 mol yr for the entire ygxfs that is lower than that of the colorado plateau 1 40 109 mol yr crossey et al 2009 and the san andreas fault with a hypothesized width of 20 km 6 60 108 mol yr kulongoski et al 2013 additionally if we consider relative proportions of the mantle and crustal carbon i e average m car org 0 0243 for the bend segment and 0 0138 for the nw segment constrained by the ternary mixing model fig 4a and table s2 in supplementary material the crustal co2 flux would be 9 43 109 mol yr for the bend segment and 1 23 109 mol yr for the nw segment of the ygxfs taking estimated mantle and crustal co2 fluxes together the ygxfs would have a total co2 flux of 1 09 1010 mol yr with the bend segment releasing 88 5 i e 9 66 109 mol yr of the total co2 flux estimated for the entire ygxfs intense degassing of co2 rich fluids along normal and or strike slip faults has been predicted for the himalayan tibetan orogen at a global scale model of tectonic co2 degassing tamburello et al 2018 our observational results in the eastern tibetan plateau agree well with the model it should be noted that the fluxes of 3he and co2 are calculated based on theoretical assumptions e g parameters of the helium transport model carbon inventory calculated from the ternary mixing model length and width of faults but still we suggest that the high 3he and co2 fluxes of the bend segment are consistent with geochemical evidence e g high 3he 4he fig 2 field observations of hydrothermal activities liu et al 2022 and regional fault development bai et al 2021 5 4 controlling factors for fluid migration the pathways acting as the conduits for migration of the deeply derived fluids e g he and co2 through the crust play an essential role in determining the geochemical features of the hydrothermal gases at the surface in this section the controlling factors for deeply derived fluid migration shown by a 3he 4he case are explored by evaluating the physical properties of the y shaped active fault system e g depth geometry stress state and permeability compressional tectonic settings with overlapping structures such as thrust fault systems may inhibit efficient fluid uprising tamburello et al 2018 for the lmfs the hydrothermal gases have a typical crustal he source as shown by their low 3he 4he ratios and high amounts of radiogenic he fig 4b and table s1 in supplementary material furthermore the crustal he degassing along the lmfs agrees well with the relatively shallow depths ca 20 km of its flattening in the crust hubbard and shaw 2009 and the convergence and deformation state of the crustal scale thrusting system li et al 2022 strike slip fault systems that may penetrate from the surface to upper mantle depths are considered favorable pathways for the migration of mantle fluids e g klemperer et al 2013 experimental results of tanikawa et al 2010 indicate that the permeability of sandstone and granite rocks significantly increased at high slip rates which may facilitate rapid uprising of the mantle fluids and thus diminish the effects of he dilution by crustal materials the slip rates of the ygxfs and anfs exhibit clear variations from nw to se along different segments of the large scale strike slip fault system fig 5 a bai et al 2021 moreover these fault segments are characterized by a clear positive correlation r2 0 92 between 3he 4he ratios and slip rates fig 5b interestingly the higher 3he 4he ratios of hydrothermal gases are distributed in the bend segment of the ygxfs i e xsf se and xsf km in fig 5b where the slip rates are higher bai et al 2021 however there is some uncertainty regarding the correlation between he isotopes and slip rates along the ygxfs notably there are large variations in 3he 4he along the strike of xsf se and xsf km suggesting that such uncertainty is influenced by local permeability of faults depth and geometry of penetrating faults and conditions of groundwater circulation in addition as expected for the he dilution effects the 3he 4he ratios observed in the ygxfs tend to be significantly higher than those away from the fault zone fig 5c similar 3he 4he distribution was also found in other active strike slip fault systems worldwide fig 5c klemperer et al 2013 and references therein the bend segment of the ygxfs is a transpressional zone characterized by high shear strain crustal shortening and rapid exhumation cook et al 2018 the distribution of regime stress ratio rsr li et al 2022 also shows that this region mainly experienced compression and strike slip shear deformations fig 6 a consistent with the discovery of typical augen mylonite and migmatite zone in kangding moxi region chen et al 2020 we note that the 3he 4he ratios positively correlate with rsr along the ygxfs r2 0 71 fig 6b localized high mantle he anomalies along active strike slip faults have also been observed in the big bend area of the san andreas fault where high shear strain rates suggest fault transpression kennedy and van soest 2007 they suggested that the penetration of mantle fluids through the ductile lower crust is related to shear strain enhanced permeability in the crust here the ductile crust in the eastern tibetan plateau may be located at a depth ranging between 20 and 40 km jiang et al 2015 the mantle he degassing along the ygxfs suggests the fault may reach moho depth or beyond to access the tectonically activated mantle lithosphere and act as the conduit that allows upward transport of mantle he through the ductile lower crust this interpretation is supported by geological and geophysical observations of the fault geometry he et al 2017 5 5 understanding seismogenic processes through tectonic degassing a large number of earthquakes occurred in the y shaped active fault system which are dynamically related to the crustal structure and tectonics driven by the continuous india asia continental collision tapponnier et al 2001 the most striking feature of seismicity along the lmfs is its high frequency that results in a total number of earthquakes fig 7 a significantly higher than that of the strike slip fault systems fig 7b d the hypocenter of earthquakes focuses on the middle to upper crustal depths d 15 7 10 7 km fig 7a consistent with the predominant crustal source recognized for he and co2 along the lmfs fig 8 a in particular the high contents of radiogenic he and excessed n2 in the hydrothermal gases may suggest long term accumulation of crustal fluids ballentine et al 2002 and preferential dissolution of co2 relative to he and n2 in the aquifer systems fig 8a randazzo et al 2021 such gas chemistry can be explained by the convergence dominated crustal deformation along the lmfs hubbard and shaw 2009 which is expected to create subsurface traps for deeply derived fluids miller et al 2004 in such traps the crustal derived fluids e g co2 and radiogenic he fig 8a can accumulate for a long residence time and result in over pressurized reservoirs that may trigger earthquakes tamburello et al 2018 the 2008 mw 7 9 wenchuan earthquake can be considered an example of seismogenic processes in thrust fault systems that may be influenced by overpressure related to trapped fluids fig 8a large amounts of radiogenic he from rocks and crustal derived co2 could be released by intensive seismicity caracausi et al 2022 as shown by observations after the wenchuan earthquake zheng et al 2013 zhou et al 2015 generally the geochemical features of hydrothermal gases and tectonic setting of the lmfs resemble those of the abruzzi region in the central apennines italy where overpressure conditions of the local faults may have driven the 2009 earthquake swarms due to the accumulation of fluids with long residence time chiodini et al 2011 therefore the trapped high pressure fluids may promote the fault weakening mechanism chiodini et al 2020 miller 2020 and thus favor seismicity along the collisional front of the lmfs which is supported by geophysical observations fig 8b wang et al 2021b compared to lmfs most earthquakes along the ygxfs and anfs have hypocenter depths ranging from 5 to 20 km fig 7b d and occur above the ductile brittle transition zones however some deeper earthquakes 25 km are also observed in this strike slip fault system especially beneath the bend segment of the ygxfs and the anfs li et al 2015 considering the predominant crustal fluid sources identified for the anfs it is likely that crustal fluids may contribute to the seismogenic processes similar to the lmfs despite in a case of strike slip faulting processes the earthquake density of the bend segment length 250 km fig 7c of the ygxfs is higher than that of its nw segment with a length of ca 650 km fig 7b which is consistent with the intense crustal deformation and enhanced failure of country rocks along the bend segment cook et al 2018 bai et al 2021 the role of deeply derived co2 rich fluids in creating overpressurization at depth has been proposed in previous studies miller et al 2004 chiodini et al 2011 gunatilake and miller 2022 the significant degassing of mantle fluids along the bend segment fig 8c suggests that mantle derived co2 may have contributed to the seismogenic processes by fluid over pressurization notably the case of the san andreas fault suggests that the mantle co2 rich fluids alone may be insufficient to generate the super hydrostatic pressure in the seismogenic zone kulongoski et al 2013 for the ygxfs thermal springs show predominant crustal derived co2 from metamorphic decarbonization and a combined mantle and crustal co2 flux 9 66 109 mol yr in the bend segment of the ygxfs significantly higher than that of the nw branching fault 1 25 109 mol yr this is consistent with previous finding that the bend fault segment can efficiently release deeply sourced volatiles e g he and co2 due to enhanced fault permeability related to crustal deformation zhang et al 2021a in addition the higher flux of deeply derived co2 rich fluids is also likely to facilitate the higher slip rates fig 5a bai et al 2021 and plays a significant role in earthquake triggering processes beneath the bend segment relative to the nw segment of the ygxfs we suggest that accumulation of the deeply derived co2 rich fluids in the seismogenic zone may cause overpressure mechanical weakening and earthquake nucleation beneath the ygxfs fig 8c especially for the bend segment where enhanced crustal deformation and fault failure structures developed as a result of disrupted slip transfer we suggest that the risk of earthquake hazard may be relatively high in the kangding moxi region along the bend segment of the ygxfs consistent with the predictions in a current slip deficit model bai et al 2021 and a 3d geomechanical model li et al 2022 in particular the recently occurred ms 6 8 luding earthquake september 5 2022 may be an example of the seismogenic processes in our model that involves high fluxes of mantle and crustal co2 rich fluids as a possible trigger factor for earthquake nucleation in a dynamic setting of localized crustal deformation and fault failure mechanics during bending of the large scale strike slip fault system 6 conclusions we report new chemical compositions and he c isotopic data for hydrothermal gases from the y shaped active fault system based on quantitative constraints on the fluid origin and transport we identify i predominant crustal sources for he and co2 released from the lmfs and anfs and ii significant mantle and crustal fluids along the ygxfs especially its bend segment a high 3he 4he anomaly with a maximum mantle he proportion of 34 is observed in the axis zone of the y shaped active fault system with decreasing mantle he inputs towards the nw ne and se branching faults due to either mantle he dilution effects or contrasting fluid sources between the thrust and strike slip fault systems the well correlated 3he 4he ratios and slip rates suggest a genetic model in which the uprising of co2 rich fluids may facilitate rapid fault slipping and enhanced fault permeability which in turn leads to efficient mantle he degassing for the thrust fault systems i e lmfs crustal derived fluids are inferred to have accumulated in deep traps for a long residence time and lead to over pressurized reservoirs that may trigger high frequency earthquakes in a dynamic setting of convergence dominated crustal deformation for the strike slip fault systems i e ygxfs and anfs the deeply derived mainly metamorphic co2 rich fluids may cause overpressure and in consequence mechanical weakening of the seismogenic zone especially for the bend segment that is characterized by high deep co2 fluxes and high strain rates in response to the disrupted slip transfer from the ygxfs to the anfs our findings successfully correlate tectonic degassing with seismogenic processes of the y shaped active fault system in a dynamic setting of crustal deformation and fault failure mechanics driven by lateral expansion of the eastern tibetan plateau credit authorship contribution

al 2020 randazzo et al 2021 zhang et al 2022 the india asia continental collision since the early cenozoic created one of the earth s most tectonically active regions the tibetan plateau and its surroundings where earthquakes exert high threats on densely populated settlements near large active fault zones zhang et al 2010 the eastern tibetan plateau is characterized by a y shape active fault system fig 1 which consists of the yushu ganzi xianshuihe fault system ygxfs in the northwest the longmenshan fault system lmfs in the northeast and the anninghe fault system anfs in the southeast wu and gao 2019 these active thrusts and strike slip faults have accommodated crustal shortening and extrusion since at least the mid miocene time tapponnier et al 2001 hubbard and shaw 2009 cook et al

of the thrust faults i e lmfs and strike slip faults i e ygxfs and anfs fluid migration plays a crucial role in reducing the effective normal stress on active faults by increasing pore fluid pressures associated with fluid flows through highly permeable fracture zones which may facilitate the earthquake nucleation processes miller et al 2004 menzies et al 2016 the role of deeply derived fluids in triggering earthquakes has been recognized in compressional strike slip and extensional tectonic regimes kennedy et al 1997 kulongoski et al 2013 bräuer et al 2014 lee et al 2019 caracausi and sulli 2019 chiodini et al 2020 martinelli 2021 chiaraluce et al 2022 recent research has highlighted that he degassing is a useful indicator of seismogenic process in tectonically active continental regions caracausi et al 2022 however few studies have explored the correlations between tectonic degassing and seismogenesis for the active fault systems dominated by growth of orogenic plateaux previous studies on gas geochemistry in the eastern and southeastern tibetan plateau generally focused on volatile origin and co2 emissions and were lack of interpretation on seismogenic processes through a comparison of tectonic degassing between thrust i e lmfs and strike slip fault i e ygxfs and anfs systems e g zhang et al 2021a xu et al 2022 wang et al 2023 recent work by liu et al 2022 based on hydrochemistry of thermal waters interpreted the spatial distribution of earthquakes along the ygxfs through the heterogeneity of crustal thermal structure related to fluid circulation but still the degassing of deeply derived fluids is yet to be constrained for evaluating the role of uprising fluids in seismogenesis here we present a quantitative study on the degassing of hydrothermal gases from the y shaped active fault system in eastern tibetan plateau fig 1 using the he co2 elemental and isotopic systematics e g 3he 4he and δ13cco2 of the bubbling gases from thermal springs we quantitatively constrain i the origin of deeply derived fluids and the involved physico chemical processes during source to surface fluid transport in the y shaped active fault system and ii the upward flow rates of mantle fluids and the he and co2 fluxes combined with constraints from geological geophysical and seismic studies we try to delineate the controlling factors for tectonic degassing from thrust and strike slip fault systems and further evaluate the potential role of deeply derived fluids in seismogenic processes finally a genetic model is proposed for the subsurface fluid origin and transport in which the uprising of co2 rich fluids may facilitate overpressure involved in earthquake triggering of the y shaped active fault system 2 geological setting 2 1 the y shaped active fault system the ne striking lmfs is about 500 km long 40 50 km wide and comprises a series of generally nw dipping thrust faults which are characterized by vertical slip rates of 1 mm yr and right lateral slip rates of 2 3 mm yr zhang et al 2010 this fault system defines the eastern margin of the tibetan plateau and connects with the ygxfs and anfs in its southwestern end fig 1 the lmfs is well known for the 2008 mw 7 9 wenchuan earthquake that occurred as a result of the oblique convergence between the songpan ganzi block and the sichuan basin hubbard and shaw 2009 rock units along the lmfs are composed of paleozoic mesozoic flysch formations and carbonate with volcanic rocks the ygxfs is an arcuate left lateral strike slip fault system with a length of 800 km which can be divided into the yushu ganzi fault in the northwest and the xianshuihe fault in the southeast fig 1 liu et al 2022 it dips 80 and has left lateral slip rates of about 10 mm yr bai et al 2021 and references therein recent major earthquakes along the ygxfs include the 2010 mw 7 1 yushu earthquake 2014 mw 6 3 kangding earthquake and 2022 ms 6 8 luding earthquake as shown in fig 1 the ygxfs transects triassic sedimentary rocks and volcanic rocks and is locally intruded by meso cenozoic plutons to the south the ygxfs links to the anfs near shimian the 160 km long anfs was generated by ns trending faulting processes initiated in the miocene fig 1 wang et al 2021a based on geological offset and geodetic data for the anfs the estimated quaternary sinistral slip rates are 6 5 1 mm yr shan et al 2013 and references therein the anfs is seismically active as shown by the 1952 mw 6 7 mianning earthquake shan et al 2013 it consists of several parallel strands and passes through complex precambrian to mesozoic rock units including quartzite marble dolostone metasandstone and basic to acidic volcanic rocks fig 1 2 2 a focal zone of orogenic plateau expansion tectonically the y shaped active fault system represents boundary faults of the eastern tibetan plateau that recorded lateral growth via fold and thrust structures i e lmfs hubbard and shaw 2009 and strike slip faults i e ygxfs and anfs tapponnier et al 2001 respectively under the context of the orogenic plateau expansion there are a lot of hydrothermal manifestations fig 1 and densely distributed earthquakes in the y shaped active fault system zhang et al 2010 bai et al 2021 this focal zone of orogenic plateau growth significantly influenced the motion of crustal blocks and regional tectonic evolution clark and royden 2000 the eastern margin of the tibetan plateau along the lmfs is characterized by a steep topographic relief significant crustal deformation occurred mainly by convergence perpendicular to the lmfs right lateral shear and vertical movement hubbard and shaw 2009 resulting in a strain energy conveyor belt that continuously transfers its deformation into accumulating stress on the lmfs zhang et al 2010 the ongoing stage of southeastward expansion of the tibetan plateau can be traced back to the initiation ages of active fault systems probably in the mid to late miocene tapponnier et al 2001 cook et al 2018 as represented by the ygxfs the most notable feature of the ygxsf is the bend segment near the axis zone of the y shaped active fault system fig 1 which is an enhanced fault failure structure due to disrupted slip transfer the bend segment of the ygxfs is characterized by miocene to pliocene 14 5 ma searle et al 2016 emplacement of the gongga shan batholith with possibly synchronous tectonics of secondary fault segments bai et al 2021 3 samples and methods hydrothermal manifestations along the y shaped active fault system mainly include hot springs boiling springs

elucidate the correlations between tectonic degassing and regional seismicity we collected 46 gas samples from 24 thermal springs using low he diffusivity glass vessels during a field campaign in 2020

procedure for he and ne described in cao et al 2016 3he 4he and 4he 20ne ratios were measured in static mode and calibrated relative to air standard analytical errors for 3he 4he and 4he 20ne ratio was 3 to estimate mantle fluid flow rates and fluxes of mantle he and co2 along the strike slip fault system where mantle fluids are degassing we calculated the dissolved gas 4he and 20ne equilibrium concentrations in hot spring waters based on the partial pressure of helium 3he 4he and 4he 20ne of the bubbling gases this method is based on an assumption of equilibrium gas separation from the water phase that is constrained by 4he 20ne calibration at water temperatures and calculation of 20ne equilibrium concentrations in the water phase following henry s law also at the spring water temperatures see details in zhang et al 2022 the results were then used in a one dimensional steady state advection model which was proposed for the transport of mantle fluids through the continental crust kennedy et al 1997 4 results the major gas species of most gas samples along the lmfs and anfs is n2 while co2 rich gases are more commonly observed along the ygxfs fig s1 and table s1 in supplementary material methane ch4 contents are high 33 6 44 7 in four samples from the lmfs and ygxfs and the other samples have low ch4 5 most samples have low o2 contents 3 and suggest little contamination by atmospheric o2 or dissolved oxygen in near surface environments table s1 in supplementary material argon ar is generally at low levels 1 in all samples table s1 in supplementary material the ygxfs samples have he concentrations of 0 1 2087 ppm table s1 in supplementary material which are generally lower than those of the lmfs samples 186 5653 ppm this study and zhou et al 2017 and especially the anfs samples 1 95 2 62 xu et al 2022 the 4he 20ne ratios for most samples range from 3 4 to 3389 fig 2 and are much higher than the atmospheric ratio 0 318 ozima and podosek

rc ra of the lmfs and anfs samples vary from 0 01 to 0 03 and 0 03 to 0 09 this study and xu et al 2022 respectively showing a purely radiogenic he origin in contrast the ygxsf exhibits significant mantle he degassing as suggested by the wide range of 0 03 2 73 ra this study and xu et al 2022 fig s2a in supplementary material notably the 3he 4he ratios along the nw segment of the ygxfs 0 03 0 62 ra are much lower than those 3he 4he 0 94 2 73 ra of the bend segment i e axis zone of the y shaped fault system fig 1 the δ13cco2 values of gas samples along the ygxfs range from 8 9 to 0 2 fig s2b in supplementary material with all values falling within or slightly higher than the common range associated with morb mantle 6 5 2 sano and marty 1995 the δ13cco2 values of the lmfs and anfs samples have a wide range of 17 3 to 5 2 in addition the δ13cch4 values of 49 0 to 18 1 are close to those of thermogenic gases liu et al 2019 but show no spatial variations our samples have co2 3he ratios 2 0 108 to 2 4 1012 ranging over 4 orders of magnitude table s2 in supplementary material with n2 or ch4 rich gases characterized by lower co2 3he ratios than typical mantle value 2 109 sano and marty 1995 as more commonly observed in the anfs and lmfs fig s2c in supplementary material 5 discussion 5 1 helium inventory and spatial variations helium isotopes have been widely used to identify the sources of deeply derived fluids in different geotectonic settings 4he is mainly produced by the radioactive decay of u and th elements whereas 3he has primordial tritiogenic and nucleogenic sources ozima and podosek 2002 therefore the relative contributions of different helium sources to hydrothermal fluids must be constrained 3he originating from the decay of tritium 3h β 3he and neutron reaction of 6li in aquifer rocks 6li n ɑ 3h β 3he has been estimated to be insignificant in the eastern tibetan plateau due to low tritium concentrations in thermal waters and low production rate of in situ nucleogenic 3he xu et al 2022 therefore the binary mixing between crustal 3he 4he 0 02 ra ballentine et al 2002 and mantle he is plausible notably there is no evidence for the presence of metasomatized sub continental lithospheric mantle beneath the study area for simplicity the morb type upper mantle 3he 4he 8 1 ra graham 2002 is considered in the calculation of total he inventory of the hydrothermal gases as shown in fig 2 all the lmfs samples are dominated by purely crustal radiogenic he and similarly the anfs samples have mantle he contributions lower than 1 in contrast mantle he contributions to hydrothermal gases along the ygxfs vary from 0 14 to 34 with samples from its bend segment characterized by much higher mantle he proportions 11 34 than those observed along its nw segment fig 2 in particular the highest 3he 4he 2 73 ra xu et al 2022 along the ygxfs is slightly higher or comparable to the maximum 3he 4he 2 24 ra of the karakoram fault in the western tibetan plateau klemperer et al 2013 moreover there is no evidence for recent mantle derived magmatism for our study area paleozoic mantle derived pegmatite dikes occur sporadically along the ygxfs and its adjacent areas and cannot explain the mantle he signature in hydrothermal gases xu et al 2022 taking into account all the 3he 4he data of hydrothermal gases from the tibetan plateau and surrounding regions zhang et al 2021a klemperer et al 2022 the hydrothermal gases released from active faults have mantle he proportions significantly lower than those of the quaternary volcanic fields 3he 4he 5 ra zhang et al 2021b mantle he is most efficiently transferred by the mantle derived melt intrusion through volcanism magmatism into the crust in comparison with diffusion through solid mantle that is extremely slow ballentine et al 2002 therefore the above feature can be ascribed to potential differences in the efficiency of mantle he transport through the continental crust between non volcanic and volcanic regions moreover the large 3he 4he variabilities are also observed in the representative active faults worldwide fig 2 showing variable degrees of mantle he dilution by crustal he due to fault dependent permeability extension lithology and the earthquake magnitude kennedy et al 1997 crossey et al 2016 zhang et al 2021a caracausi et al 2022 geophysical observations suggested abrupt changes in moho topography beneath the axis zone of the y shaped tectonic syntaxis liu et al 2014 which may represent the deep tectonic responses of the lateral expansion of the eastern tibetan plateau fig 3 a and can influence the upwelling of mantle heat flow along the fault system wang et al 2019 for the kangding moxi region along the bend segment of the ygxfs fig 3b the deep heat may originate from partial melts of the mantle either lithospheric mantle or upwelling asthenosphere as suggested by the existence of a low velocity zone at 70 km depth beneath this region li et al 2016 and asthenospheric upwelling huang et al 2019 wang et al 2021c the lowest s wave velocity zone corresponds well to the high 3he 4he anomaly located in the intersection region of lmfs ygxfs and anfs i e the axis zone of the y shaped active fault system fig 3 similarly a strong correlation between mantle he anomalies and domains with low seismic velocity and low density within the upper mantle was reported for the western usa crossey et al 2016 the efficient mantle he degassing along the bend segment of the ygxfs may reflect incipient melting of the lithospheric mantle or upwelling asthenospheric mantle as observed from a tectonically active lithospheric scale faults such as the karakoram fault in the western tibetan plateau klemperer et al 2013 in particular the hydrothermal 3he 4he ratios gradually decrease in mantle he inputs towards the ne nw and se branches of the y shaped active fault system fig 3b he isotope variations are associated with crustal he degassing from dilatancy and fracturation of rocks which have been recognized in seismically active fault zones including san andreas fault in usa futagawa hinagu fault in japan anatolian fault in turkey irpinia fault in italy sano et al 2016 caracausi et al 2022 and therein references such regional he degassing patterns can be explained by the dilution effects due to the increasing addition of crustal he into mantle he towards the branching fault segments i e increasing transport distances in the crust for mantle fluids originating from 70 km depth beneath the axis fault zone fig 3b alternatively a predominant crustal he source is also plausible for hydrothermal gases released from the lmfs and anfs if not considering the case of deep fault networks connecting with the axis zone where mantle fluids are concentrated 5 2 carbon inventory and he co2 systematics the deeply derived volatiles mainly co2 generally serve as the carrier gases for helium transport through fault zones and fractures lee et al 2019 and references therein in this study we use a ternary mixing model based on he co2 systematics proposed by sano and marty 1995 to quantify the relative proportions of potential contributions from the mantle m carbonate car and organic matter org to the total co2 inventory fig 4 a the equations are as follows 13c 12c obs f m 13c 12c m f car 13c 12c car f org 13c 12c org 1 12c 3he obs f m 12c 3he m f car 12c 3he car f org 12c 3he org f m f car f org 1 where subscripts obs m car and org refer to the observed value of the sample mantle carbonate rocks and organic sediments respectively most samples along the ygxfs fall into the mixing area bounded by the m car and org end members indicating limited he co2 fractionation and the validity of ternary mixing model in quantifying the total co2 inventory crustal carbon is dominant in most cases of the y shaped active fault system car org 90 table s2 in supplementary material while proportions of mantle carbon are much lower 0 1 4 4 specifically carbonate contribution is more significant 75 than organic matter in the carbon inventory in addition a mass balance model based on dic dissolved inorganic carbon contents and δ13cdic within thermal waters along the ygxfs revealed a dominant deep co2 origin by metamorphic decarbonization liu et al 2022 which is supported by δ14cdic values 977 to 909 of the thermal waters showing origin with affinity to dead carbon δ14c 1000 in metamorphic fluids xu et al 2022 zhong et al 2022 it should be noted that the results of the ternary mixing model in sano and marty 1995 may be influenced by the fractionation of the he co2 systematics for example the negative correlation between co2 3he and he concentrations defined by the ygxfs samples fig 4b suggests the preferential loss of he relative to co2 from the thermal waters which accounts for the increasing co2 3he ratios with decreasing he concentrations in contrast to the ygxfs most samples along the lmfs and anfs fall outside the mixing curves fig 4a suggesting that their δ13cco2 values and co2 3he ratios have been substantially modified due to secondary processes such as co2 removal by precipitation of calcite in thermal waters barry et al 2020 this possibility is supported by the temperature dependent reactions between co2 rich fluids with ca2 na and mg2 ions in thermal waters liu et al 2022 xu et al 2022 which form carbonate minerals and lead to lower co2 3he and more negative δ13c values of the residual phase to evaluate the effects of calcite precipitation on he co2 systematics we employ a calcite fractionation model proposed by barry et al 2020 in fig 4a most lmfs and anfs samples lie within the expected calcite fractionation trends at 50 c and 192 c another possibility for low co2 3he ratios of some n2 dominated samples is different degrees of co2 dissolution due to preferential dissolution of co2 in water relative to less soluble n2 during gas water interaction randazzo et al 2021 randazzo et al 2022 notably more information on n2 origin requires further study on n isotope systematics for n2 dominated gases although the carbon inventory of the lmfs and anfs samples cannot be calculated from the ternary mixing model a dominant crustal co2 source is possible as suggested by their crust dominated he inventory a crustal carbon source is also supported by δ13cch4 values 47 5 to 47 1 of some ch4 rich samples which point to the thermogenic decomposition of organic carbon components in the crust 5 3 deeply derived he and co2 fluxes mantle components in the thermal springs along the ygxfs indicate that the strike slip fault system provides a conduit for mantle derived fluids into the crustal fluid systems similar to active fault zones such as the san andreas fault kennedy et al 1997 kulongoski et al 2013 the variability of 3he 4he ratios along the faults depends on the upward flow rates of mantle fluids and the addition of radiogenic 4he during transfer through the crust kulongoski et al 2013 according to the helium transport model kennedy et al 1997 we estimated the upward flow rates of mantle he q through the ygxfs assuming a crustal thickness hcrust of 60 km q h crust ρ r p h e ρ f h e f m r s r c r m r s where ρr and ρf refer to the densities of the solid and fluid phase respectively p he is the 4he production rate from u and th in the rocks he f m is the initial mantle fluid 4he concentration rs rc and rm are the 3he 4he ratio of sample crust and mantle 4he production rate is calculated using the following equation p he ρr 1 19 10 13 u 2 88 10 14 th 1 ø ø where u and th are the contents of u and th in the rocks ø is bulk rock porosity further details e g physico chemical parameters and 4he concentrations in thermal waters about the calculation and results are given in table s4 in supplementary material the calculated upward flow rates along the ygxfs vary between 30 and 1797 mm yr table s4 in supplementary material in particular the ygxfs bend segment tends to have high mantle fluid flow rates 794 1797 mm yr except for sample ck02 table s4 in supplementary material which are relatively close to those estimated for the alpine fault 420 2600 mm yr menzies et al 2016 but significantly higher than the san andreas fault 0 4 140 mm yr kennedy et al 1997 kulongoski et al 2013 north anatolian fault 130 190 mm yr de leeuw et al 2010 and karakoram fault 12 19 mm yr klemperer et al 2013 the high 3he 4he ratios observed along the ygxfs require a rapid transfer of mantle fluids to the surface and high permeability of the fault system following the steady state upward fluid flow model kennedy et al 1997 the estimated residence time of mantle fluids would range from 0 04 to 6 ma if considering a crustal thickness of 60 km in this region based on the flow rates of mantle he the total 3he flux can be estimated using a simple equation from kulongoski et al 2013 h 3 e f l u x q ρ f h e s r s where q is the calculated upward fluid flow rate ρf is the densities of the fluid hes is the 4he concentrations of spring waters and rs is the 3he 4he ratio of samples the total 3he fluxes of thermal springs along the ygxfs have a range of 5 39 10 7 to 3 61 10 5 mol km2 yr or 1 03 104 to 6 90 105 atoms m2 s table s4 in supplementary material these results are markedly higher than 3he flux from stable continental crust 102 atoms m2 s ozima and podosek 2002 and are similar to values in central sicily 1 8 104 to 7 7 104 atoms m2 s caracausi and sulli 2019 and tectonically active continental areas 105 atoms m2 s ozima and podosek 2002 assuming co2 3he ratio of 2 109 for mantle fluids the estimated mantle co2 flux of the ygxfs would range from 1 08 103 to 7 23 104 mol km2 yr these values are lower than those of active and dormant volcanic systems worldwide and the african rift system but in good agreement with active fault system in continental region without recent volcanism such as san andreas fault 4 0 104 mol km2 yr kulongoski et al 2013 and sicily fold and thrust belt 1 8 103 to 8 2 103 mol km2 yr caracausi and sulli 2019 in particular we note that the bend segment of the ygxfs i e axis zone of the y shaped active fault system is characterized by average mantle co2 flux 4 58 104 mol km2 yr over 10 times higher than that of its nw segment 2 62 103 mol km2 yr if scaling these average mantle co2 fluxes to the bend segment length 250 km width 20 km and the nw segment length 650 km width 10 km the mantle co2 flux would be 2 29 108 mol yr for the bend segment and 1 70 107 mol yr for the nw segment yielding a total mantle co2 flux of 2 46 108 mol yr for the entire ygxfs that is lower than that of the colorado plateau 1 40 109 mol yr crossey et al 2009 and the san andreas fault with a hypothesized width of 20 km 6 60 108 mol yr kulongoski et al 2013 additionally if we consider relative proportions of the mantle and crustal carbon i e average m car org 0 0243 for the bend segment and 0 0138 for the nw segment constrained by the ternary mixing model fig 4a and table s2 in supplementary material the crustal co2 flux would be 9 43 109 mol yr for the bend segment and 1 23 109 mol yr for the nw segment of the ygxfs taking estimated mantle and crustal co2 fluxes together the ygxfs would have a total co2 flux of 1 09 1010 mol yr with the bend segment releasing 88 5 i e 9 66 109 mol yr of the total co2 flux estimated for the entire ygxfs intense degassing of co2 rich fluids along normal and or strike slip faults has been predicted for the himalayan tibetan orogen at a global scale model of tectonic co2 degassing tamburello et al 2018 our observational results in the eastern tibetan plateau agree well with the model it should be noted that the fluxes of 3he and co2 are calculated based on theoretical assumptions e g parameters of the helium transport model carbon inventory calculated from the ternary mixing model length and width of faults but still we suggest that the high 3he and co2 fluxes of the bend segment are consistent with geochemical evidence e g high 3he 4he fig 2 field observations of hydrothermal activities liu et al 2022 and regional fault development bai et al 2021 5 4 controlling factors for fluid migration the pathways acting as the conduits for migration of the deeply derived fluids e g he and co2 through the crust play an essential role in determining the geochemical features of the hydrothermal gases at the surface in this section the controlling factors for deeply derived fluid migration shown by a 3he 4he case are explored by evaluating the physical properties of the y shaped active fault system e g depth geometry stress state and permeability compressional tectonic settings with overlapping structures such as thrust fault systems may inhibit efficient fluid uprising tamburello et al 2018 for the lmfs the hydrothermal gases have a typical crustal he source as shown by their low 3he 4he ratios and high amounts of radiogenic he fig 4b and table s1 in supplementary material furthermore the crustal he degassing along the lmfs agrees well with the relatively shallow depths ca 20 km of its flattening in the crust hubbard and shaw 2009 and the convergence and deformation state of the crustal scale thrusting system li et al 2022 strike slip fault systems that may penetrate from the surface to upper mantle depths are considered favorable pathways for the migration of mantle fluids e g klemperer et al 2013 experimental results of tanikawa et al 2010 indicate that the permeability of sandstone and granite rocks significantly increased at high slip rates which may facilitate rapid uprising of the mantle fluids and thus diminish the effects of he dilution by crustal materials the slip rates of the ygxfs and anfs exhibit clear variations from nw to se along different segments of the large scale strike slip fault system fig 5 a bai et al 2021 moreover these fault segments are characterized by a clear positive correlation r2 0 92 between 3he 4he ratios and slip rates fig 5b interestingly the higher 3he 4he ratios of hydrothermal gases are distributed in the bend segment of the ygxfs i e xsf se and xsf km in fig 5b where the slip rates are higher bai et al 2021 however there is some uncertainty regarding the correlation between he isotopes and slip rates along the ygxfs notably there are large variations in 3he 4he along the strike of xsf se and xsf km suggesting that such uncertainty is influenced by local permeability of faults depth and geometry of penetrating faults and conditions of groundwater circulation in addition as expected for the he dilution effects the 3he 4he ratios observed in the ygxfs tend to be significantly higher than those away from the fault zone fig 5c similar 3he 4he distribution was also found in other active strike slip fault systems worldwide fig 5c klemperer et al 2013 and references therein the bend segment of the ygxfs is a transpressional zone characterized by high shear strain crustal shortening and rapid exhumation cook et al 2018 the distribution of regime stress ratio rsr li et al 2022 also shows that this region mainly experienced compression and strike slip shear deformations fig 6 a consistent with the discovery of typical augen mylonite and migmatite zone in kangding moxi region chen et al 2020 we note that the 3he 4he ratios positively correlate with rsr along the ygxfs r2 0 71 fig 6b localized high mantle he anomalies along active strike slip faults have also been observed in the big bend area of the san andreas fault where high shear strain rates suggest fault transpression kennedy and van soest 2007 they suggested that the penetration of mantle fluids through the ductile lower crust is related to shear strain enhanced permeability in the crust here the ductile crust in the eastern tibetan plateau may be located at a depth ranging between 20 and 40 km jiang et al 2015 the mantle he degassing along the ygxfs suggests the fault may reach moho depth or beyond to access the tectonically activated mantle lithosphere and act as the conduit that allows upward transport of mantle he through the ductile lower crust this interpretation is supported by geological and geophysical observations of the fault geometry he et al 2017 5 5 understanding seismogenic processes through tectonic degassing a large number of earthquakes occurred in the y shaped active fault system which are dynamically related to the crustal structure and tectonics driven by the continuous india asia continental collision tapponnier et al 2001 the most striking feature of seismicity along the lmfs is its high frequency that results in a total number of earthquakes fig 7 a significantly higher than that of the strike slip fault systems fig 7b d the hypocenter of earthquakes focuses on the middle to upper crustal depths d 15 7 10 7 km fig 7a consistent with the predominant crustal source recognized for he and co2 along the lmfs fig 8 a in particular the high contents of radiogenic he and excessed n2 in the hydrothermal gases may suggest long term accumulation of crustal fluids ballentine et al 2002 and preferential dissolution of co2 relative to he and n2 in the aquifer systems fig 8a randazzo et al 2021 such gas chemistry can be explained by the convergence dominated crustal deformation along the lmfs hubbard and shaw 2009 which is expected to create subsurface traps for deeply derived fluids miller et al 2004 in such traps the crustal derived fluids e g co2 and radiogenic he fig 8a can accumulate for a long residence time and result in over pressurized reservoirs that may trigger earthquakes tamburello et al 2018 the 2008 mw 7 9 wenchuan earthquake can be considered an example of seismogenic processes in thrust fault systems that may be influenced by overpressure related to trapped fluids fig 8a large amounts of radiogenic he from rocks and crustal derived co2 could be released by intensive seismicity caracausi et al 2022 as shown by observations after the wenchuan earthquake zheng et al 2013 zhou et al 2015 generally the geochemical features of hydrothermal gases and tectonic setting of the lmfs resemble those of the abruzzi region in the central apennines italy where overpressure conditions of the local faults may have driven the 2009 earthquake swarms due to the accumulation of fluids with long residence time chiodini et al 2011 therefore the trapped high pressure fluids may promote the fault weakening mechanism chiodini et al 2020 miller 2020 and thus favor seismicity along the collisional front of the lmfs which is supported by geophysical observations fig 8b wang et al 2021b compared to lmfs most earthquakes along the ygxfs and anfs have hypocenter depths ranging from 5 to 20 km fig 7b d and occur above the ductile brittle transition zones however some deeper earthquakes 25 km are also observed in this strike slip fault system especially beneath the bend segment of the ygxfs and the anfs li et al 2015 considering the predominant crustal fluid sources identified for the anfs it is likely that crustal fluids may contribute to the seismogenic processes similar to the lmfs despite in a case of strike slip faulting processes the earthquake density of the bend segment length 250 km fig 7c of the ygxfs is higher than that of its nw segment with a length of ca 650 km fig 7b which is consistent with the intense crustal deformation and enhanced failure of country rocks along the bend segment cook et al 2018 bai et al 2021 the role of deeply derived co2 rich fluids in creating overpressurization at depth has been proposed in previous studies miller et al 2004 chiodini et al 2011 gunatilake and miller 2022 the significant degassing of mantle fluids along the bend segment fig 8c suggests that mantle derived co2 may have contributed to the seismogenic processes by fluid over pressurization notably the case of the san andreas fault suggests that the mantle co2 rich fluids alone may be insufficient to generate the super hydrostatic pressure in the seismogenic zone kulongoski et al 2013 for the ygxfs thermal springs show predominant crustal derived co2 from metamorphic decarbonization and a combined mantle and crustal co2 flux 9 66 109 mol yr in the bend segment of the ygxfs significantly higher than that of the nw branching fault 1 25 109 mol yr this is consistent with previous finding that the bend fault segment can efficiently release deeply sourced volatiles e g he and co2 due to enhanced fault permeability related to crustal deformation zhang et al 2021a in addition the higher flux of deeply derived co2 rich fluids is also likely to facilitate the higher slip rates fig 5a bai et al 2021 and plays a significant role in earthquake triggering processes beneath the bend segment relative to the nw segment of the ygxfs we suggest that accumulation of the deeply derived co2 rich fluids in the seismogenic zone may cause overpressure mechanical weakening and earthquake nucleation beneath the ygxfs fig 8c especially for the bend segment where enhanced crustal deformation and fault failure structures developed as a result of disrupted slip transfer we suggest that the risk of earthquake hazard may be relatively high in the kangding moxi region along the bend segment of the ygxfs consistent with the predictions in a current slip deficit model bai et al 2021 and a 3d geomechanical model li et al 2022 in particular the recently occurred ms 6 8 luding earthquake september 5 2022 may be an example of the seismogenic processes in our model that involves high fluxes of mantle and crustal co2 rich fluids as a possible trigger factor for earthquake nucleation in a dynamic setting of localized crustal deformation and fault failure mechanics during bending of the large scale strike slip fault system 6 conclusions we report new chemical compositions and he c isotopic data for hydrothermal gases from the y shaped active fault system based on quantitative constraints on the fluid origin and transport we identify i predominant crustal sources for he and co2 released from the lmfs and anfs and ii significant mantle and crustal fluids along the ygxfs especially its bend segment a high 3he 4he anomaly with a maximum mantle he proportion of 34 is observed in the axis zone of the y shaped active fault system with decreasing mantle he inputs towards the nw ne and se branching faults due to either mantle he dilution effects or contrasting fluid sources between the thrust and strike slip fault systems the well correlated 3he 4he ratios and slip rates suggest a genetic model in which the uprising of co2 rich fluids may facilitate rapid fault slipping and enhanced fault permeability which in turn leads to efficient mantle he degassing for the thrust fault systems i e lmfs crustal derived fluids are inferred to have accumulated in deep traps for a long residence time and lead to over pressurized reservoirs that may trigger high frequency earthquakes in a dynamic setting of convergence dominated crustal deformation for the strike slip fault systems i e ygxfs and anfs the deeply derived mainly metamorphic co2 rich fluids may cause overpressure and in consequence mechanical weakening of the seismogenic zone especially for the bend segment that is characterized by high deep co2 fluxes and high strain rates in response to the disrupted slip transfer from the ygxfs to the anfs our findings successfully correlate tectonic degassing with seismogenic processes of the y shaped active fault system in a dynamic setting of crustal deformation and fault failure mechanics driven by lateral expansion of the eastern tibetan plateau credit authorship contribution

1948,in recent years global satellite precipitation accuracy has improved considerably and their application have increased widely however research on rainfall thresholds of debris flows df particularly in china is insufficient in this study rainfall thresholds triggering df were evaluated in the western region of china wrc using four high resolution satellite based precipitation datasets combined with gauge measurements and a df inventory containing over 523 events for 2000 2021 the results showed that the ability of satellite products to capture rainfall triggering df rtrig was generally higher than that of gauge observations global precipitation measurement gpm showed the best overall performance throughout the wrc with a 98 9 probability of detection pod for heavy rainfall however it exhibited a relatively poor ability to capture rtrig in the western region of the wrc the four satellite products exhibit complementary advantages in terms of their spatial distribution the combined ability of all four satellite products perfectly captured rtrig with a pod of 100 over the wrc the critical daily rtrig estimated from gpm was the highest which exhibited an overall decreasing trend from the east 100 mm to the west 50 mm in the wrc the critical rainfall duration estimated from satellite products was generally less than three days in the wrc particularly in western sichuan the antecedent effective rainfall of the first 6 10 and 14 days was critical for triggering df in the wrc the critical rainfall event duration e d curves of the wrc at low and medium early warning levels were consistent with the global e d curves estimated from other studies the mean early warning rainfall of the wrc at 3 h estimated from the four products was 16 5 20 9 and 37 mm at the low medium and high levels respectively the corresponding warning rainfall values at 24 h were 64 2 91 4 and 152 6 mm for low medium and high levels respectively the critical rainfall intensity duration curve fitted in each subregion showed a higher reliability than the curve of the wrc with a fitted r2 higher than 0 80 the short term 9h rainfall intensity in each region was higher than that of the entire wrc at all early warning levels a combination of multi source satellite precipitation products is recommended to further improve the accuracy of satellite based measurements at the local scale keywords critical rainfall intensity duration curve early warning satellite precipitation tibetan plateau xinjiang hengduan mountains data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction debris flows dfs are severe hazards in mountainous regions that threaten human life and property stanley and kirschbaum 2017 mostbauer et al 2018 li et al 2021 yu et al 2021 dfs are destructive because of their high speed ability to transport large objects and capability of burying entire cities and killing tens of thousands of people in a single event dowling and santi 2014 banihabib and forghani 2017 mountainous areas of china account for 69 4 of the country s total land area and are mainly located in the western region peng et al 2015 each year the dfs in this region cause hundreds of deaths and direct economic losses of billions of yuan a widespread consensus exists that rainfall is the primary trigger of dfs dowling and santi 2014 abancó et al 2016 bogaard and greco 2016 marra et al 2017 stanley and kirschbaum 2017 mostbauer et al 2018 berti et al 2020 long et al 2020 rainfall thresholds are fundamental for forecasting rainfall triggered df hazards and early warning systems which can save lives and property abancó et al 2016 berti et al 2020 li et al 2021 rainfall thresholds can be defined through either physical or empirical models guzzetti et al 2008 robbins 2016 brunetti et al 2018 physically based models aim to explain the dynamic processes and require a considerable volume of detailed input data such data are often difficult to acquire particularly for large areas robbins 2016 therefore empirically derived thresholds have been widely used to forecast dfs at regional and global scales robbins 2016 berti et al 2020 numerous empirical rainfall thresholds have been proposed at global regional and local scales in previous studies guzzetti et al 2008 segoni et al 2018 empirical models use statistical approaches based on historical df catalogues to identify the relationship between rainfall parameters and dfs robbins 2016 rainfall parameters generally include cumulative rainfall antecedent effective rainfall rainfall intensity and rainfall duration robbins 2016 zhao et al 2022 the most common combinations of parameters are intensity duration rainfall event duration and antecedent rainfall conditions segoni et al 2018 accurate rainfall measurements and detailed df catalogues are essential for the development of rainfall thresholds ebert et al 2007 robbins 2016 rain gauge observations near df initiation areas are typically applied to identify rainfall thresholds triggering dfs abancó et al 2016 however two problems are present in the application of gauge observations first precipitation has considerable spatial heterogeneity in mountainous areas prone to dfs nikolopoulos et al 2014 abancó et al 2016 marra et al 2017 for example the daily precipitation was 23 5 mm and 229 6 mm at two stations within 20 km and differed fivefold within 10 km yang et al 2020 in addition gauge rainfall is underestimated by up to 40 at 6 7 km distances nikolopoulos et al 2015 second rain gauge networks are not available in most developing countries especially in mountainous areas resulting in inadequacy in this method for supporting threshold analysis long et al 2020 compared with eastern china the density of the rain gauge network in western china is extremely low to support the threshold analyses when no reliable rain gauge network exists in the study area satellite based measurements are the best available option robbins 2016 marra et al 2017 segoni et al 2018 brunetti et al 2021 satellite based measurements can effectively combat the problem of insufficient spatial resolution of precipitation in mountainous areas with complex terrain because they monitor area rainfall in other words the satellite based measurements directly represent the rainfall over a specific area the increased availability consistency and high spatiotemporal resolution of these data allow for broad scale global regional country and catchment level df hazard assessments that are not limited by inaccessibility due to terrain culture or politics robbins 2016 segoni et al 2018 brunetti et al 2021 satellite based precipitation data has been widely used in recent years several studies have applied tropical rainfall measurement mission multi satellite precipitation analysis products to identify rainfall thresholds that trigger shallow landslides and dfs hong and adler 2008 kirschbaum et al 2012 nikolopoulos et al 2017 random errors and biases are the major problems associated with satellite based precipitation estimates xie and arkin 1997 the latest satellite based precipitation products are increasingly accurate and reliable because they combine multi satellite data to reduce random errors and are blended with gauge observations to remove bias integrated multi satellite retrieval imerg products from the global precipitation measurement gpm mission generally exhibit the best performance compared with other satellite based precipitation products at global and regional scales huffman et al 2019 chen et al 2020 including australia islam et al 2020 bangladesh montes et al 2021 eastern himalayas kumar et al 2021 and nigeria nwachukwu et al 2020 evaluations have also shown that the gpm is the best satellite product in china chen et al 2020 tang et al 2020 zhang et al 2020a 2021 wei et al 2021 segoni et al 2018 reviewed the literature on rainfall thresholds for shallow landslides and df occurrences and recommended the use of satellite based measurements to determine df triggered rainfall thresholds however research on rainfall thresholds of dfs using satellite based data remains limited this study evaluated rainfall thresholds triggering dfs using gauged and satellite based precipitation measurements and a df dataset for the western region of china wrc to achieve three key objectives 1 develop a df inventory that contains over 523 df events triggered by heavy rainfall during the 2000 2021 period in the wrc 2 evaluate the ability of gauged and satellite based precipitation measurements to capture heavy rainfall triggering dfs in the wrc and 3 identify the critical rainfall intensity duration i d and critical rainfall event duration e d curves of the wrc and investigate early warning rainfall triggering dfs in the wrc and its sub regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 data 2 1 1 the df catalogue the database used in this study was collated using df event information from the china flood and drought disaster bulletin national geological disaster notification flood and drought bulletins of each province journal publications online news and social media these data sources validated and complemented each other data on landslide disasters were excluded and only df data were used the 523 df events that occurred in the wrc were selected for further analysis fig 1 and these df events were mainly triggered by heavy rainfall the information included the location time of occurrence and number of affected people 2 1 2 gauge observed precipitation data the gauge observed precipitation data provided by the national climate center of the china meteorological administration included a continuous data series from 1951 to 2018 there are 834 meteorological stations in china the raw dataset consisted of 12 h 8p m to 8 a m and 8 a m to 8p m and 24 h 8p m to 8p m precipitation data in beijing the raw data based on local time were converted into data based on coordinated universal time utc for comparison with the satellite based products the utc equals the beijing time minus 8 h 2 1 3 satellite based precipitation products four satellite based precipitation products were used in the study the climate prediction center morphing technique cmorph bias corrected satellite precipitation product joyce and xie 2011 was obtained from january 1998 to december 2020 at a resolution of 8 km the gpm imerg final run v 06 is a level 3 precipitation product huffman et al 2019 which uses multiple passive microwave satellite sensors to measure precipitation the algorithm was combined with precipitation gauge analyses microwave calibrated infrared satellite estimates and other precipitation estimators at a fine spatial resolution 0 1 the data series used in this study spanned from june 2006 to december 2020 the multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswep product merges the gauge satellite and reanalysis data and has a 0 1 resolution beck et al 2019 the precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks persiann product is a real time high resolution 0 04 satellite precipitation product developed by the center for hydrometeorology and remote sensing at the university of california irvine nguyen et al 2019 the data used were from june 2003 to december 2020 the four satellite products had a 3 hourly series cmorph mswep and persiann comprise near real time estimates with a latency of 3 h whereas the gpm has a latency of approximately three months 2 2 methods 2 2 1 definition of critical rainfall events triggering dfs a rainfall event is defined as a rainfall record between two adjacent rainless periods 3 and 24 h rainless periods are defined as rainfall lower than 0 5 mm and 1 mm in 3 h and 24 h respectively runoff generated by rainfall below these thresholds has minimal influence on dfs and is negligible the rainfall events in which df occurs are defined as critical rainfall events the rainfall parameters included critical rainfall intensity cumulative rainfall antecedent effective rainfall aer also called the antecedent precipitation index and duration the critical rainfall parameters were defined according to leonarduzzi et al 2017 2 2 2 performance statistics for capturing rainfall triggering dfs based on the catalogue of 523 df events triggered by heavy rainfall the ability of meteorological observation stations and satellite products to capture rainfall triggering df rtrig was evaluated in the wrc the evaluation focused on three parameters 24 h rainfall r24hr critical 3 h rainfall rc3hr and their combination owing to the lack of accessible hourly rainfall data the r24hr at the meteorological station was the sum of the 12 h rainfall at df occurrence and the previous 12 h rainfall the r24hr was divided into moderate heavy storm and heavy storm levels which were defined as 10 r24hr 25 mm 25 r24hr 50 mm 50 r24hr 100 mm and r24hr 100 mm respectively in the evaluation of the combined performance it shows ability to capture rtrig if it is captured by r24hr or rc3hr the combined performance of multiple products in capturing rtrig is similar that is it shows ability to capture rtrig if it is captured by any of the products the probability of detection pod which provides the fraction of rain occurrences that were correctly detected ebert et al 2007 was used to evaluate the ability of the gauged or satellite based measurements to capture rtrig the pod was calculated as follows 1 pod h h m where h is the rtrig correctly detected by gauged or satellite products and m is the undetected rtrig 2 2 3 calculation of the aer i d and e d curves the most common combinations for identifying rainfall thresholds segoni et al 2018 were used by determining the follows 1 i d curve 2 e d curve and 3 aer the aer is expressed as follows 2 p ae p 0 i 1 n k i p i where pae is the aer p 0 represents rainfall on the day of df occurrence and p i is the rainfall on the i th day before df occurs k i p i represents the effective rainfall on the i th day according to empirical local settings k was set as 0 84 liu et al 2020 li et al 2022 the i d and e d curves are expressed follows 3 i α 1 d β 1 4 e α 2 d β 2 where i is the critical rainfall intensity mm h e is critical rainfall mm d is the duration h and α and β are the parameters of the curve the i d and e d curves in this study were determined using the critical rainfall corresponding to the df events fig 2 the method for determining the i d and e d curves was based on that described by guzzetti et al 2007 the steps were as follows 1 the closest pixel to each df was selected for each satellite product and the critical rainfall amount e intensity i and duration d were calculated according to fig 2a 2 a scatter plot of the i d or e d data was drawn 3 for each d if the number of df events in this duration was greater than three the probability values 5 25 and 75 of i or e in this duration were calculated 4 for the calculated probability values exponential i d or e d curves were fitted using the least squares method these three probability values represent low medium and high early warning levels respectively 5 rainfall thresholds triggering df were analyzed at these three early warning levels 3 results 3 1 evaluation of the gauge and satellite based measurement abilities in capturing rtrig the ability of gauge and satellite based measurements to capture rtrig was evaluated using the df dataset the evaluation results are presented in table 1 gauge observations captured moderate and heavy rain with pods of 87 5 and 60 8 respectively however it did not effectively capture heavy storm rain pod 4 4 in general the ability of satellite based measurements to capture rtrig was higher than that of gauge observations particularly for gpm persiann and mswep products gpm showed the best performance with pod of 99 6 and 98 9 for moderate and heavy rainfall respectively the combined ability to capture r24hr or rc3hr 50 mm was 91 6 the performance of persiann was similar to that of gpm however the ability of persiann to capture heavy rain was better than that of the gpm and it was also the highest among all satellite products this result was mainly because the extreme rainfall captured by persiann was generally higher than that of gpm compared with the persiann and gpm products mswep was only able to capture moderate rainfall with comparable pod the pod of r24hr combined with rc3hr was only 67 9 which was much lower than those of both gpm and persiann cmorph showed the most inferior performance among all satellites with a pod generally lower than the other three satellite products it only showed a greater ability than mswep to capture heavy storm rainfall the combined ability of all the satellite products perfectly captured rtrig with a pod of 100 for capturing moderate or heavy rainfall the pod of all satellite products for capturing r24hr or rc3hr 50 mm was 99 6 in other words among the 523 heavy rainfall events that caused dfs in the wrc the combined results of the four satellite products showed that r24hr or rc3hr of 521 dfs exceeded 50 mm as the four satellite products complement each other the combined satellite products could accurately represent the actual rainfall of the wrc fig 3 shows the spatial distribution of r24hr before df estimation from the gauged and satellite products the r24hr of gauge observations was generally low especially in the western and northern regions for example it was generally lower than 10 mm in the xingjiang gansu inner mongolia and ningxia provinces the r24hr of gauge observation was greatly affected by the distance between the monitoring site and the df location fig 1 which was generally over 70 km in addition even if the distance is 10 km a substantial difference in rainfall exists due to impacts of local terrain factors therefore even gauges show poor performances while capturing rtrig because of irregular terrain the ability of the different satellite products to capture r24hr showed substantial spatial variation although the overall performance of cmorph was relatively poor its r24hr in xinjiang the most far reaching inland region of china was considerably higher than those of the other satellite products with an average of 144 6 mm cmorph had a higher r24hr in the northern region than in the southern region compared with the other products the r24hr of gpm predominantly captured storm or heavy storm rainfall levels a few df sites had r24hr lower than 50 mm which were mainly located in the western region of the wrc the r24hr gradually increased from west to east the mean r24hr of the df sites was 60 mm in each province heavy storm levels were experienced in most provinces except for xinjiang tibet and inner mongolia the mean values of r24hr were relatively high in guizhou 169 2 mm chongqing 199 9 mm and guangxi 215 3 mm the overall performance of persiann was similar to that of gpm however its spatial distribution differs from that of gpm the r24hr of persiann was higher than that of the other satellite products in tibet which reached a heavy storm level at each df site with an average value of 126 0 mm the r24hr of the mswep gradually increased from west to east which this is consistent with the spatial distribution of the gpm however its value is generally lower than that of the gpm the 25 frequency value of r24hr for all satellite products was approximately 50 mm fig 4 shows the spatial distribution of the combined ability of satellite products in capturing r24hr or rc3hr 50 mm the cmorph had a strong ability to capture storm rain in the northwestern region of the wrc fig 4 a it showed perfect performance in xinjiang inner mongolia and ningxia with a pod of 100 however its performance was relatively poor in most provinces 7 12 with a pod below 50 the combined ability of the mswep was better in the eastern wrc than in the western wrc fig 4c it showed perfect performances in guangxi guizhou and inner mongolia with a pod of 100 however its pod was lower than 50 in western provinces such as xinjiang ningxia gansu qinghai and gansu persiann was also generally able to capture storm rainfall in the wrc fig 4d its pod was 75 in most provinces 11 12 except for inner mongolia persiann was the only satellite product with a pod of 100 in the qinghai tibet plateau the pod was also 100 in ningxia and guizhou the gpm showed the strongest ability in capturing r24hr or rc3hr 50 mm in the wrc fig 4b persiann showed the lowest capturing ability in tibet with a pod of 80 and had a perfect performance in most provinces 7 12 with a pod of 100 the gpm had an inferior performance at a few df sites that were mainly located in the hengduan mountains region the four satellite products complemented each other in terms of their spatial distribution the combined ability of all the products was also analyzed fig 4e and the results show that r24hr or rc3hr 50 mm were captured at almost all df sites 522 523 the performance of the satellite products showed high consistency in capturing rainfall over 50 mm at 23 of the sites 122 523 these sites are mainly located in the surrounding areas of the sichuan basin southern gansu and eastern shaanxi less than three products at each site which were widely distributed throughout the wrc had the ability to capture rainfall 50 mm 3 2 spatial and temporal distribution of rtrig estimated from satellite products the temporal changes in satellite rainfall during df occurrence and its early stages at all df sites are shown in fig 5 the rtrig of the wrc estimated from the satellite products mainly occurred on the df day when it was considerably higher than those on the other days for all df sites the mean and median values of rainfall on the df day varied between 21 6 and 78 5 mm d and 12 5 64 2 mm d respectively gpm and cmorph had the highest and lowest values respectively according to the 3 h series rtrig was mainly concentrated in the first 12 h of df all satellite products showed the highest rainfall at 3 h when df occurred the mean and median for 3 h rainfall varied between 14 6 and 41 5 mm 3h and 10 6 36 4 mm 3h respectively gpm and cmorph had the highest and lowest values respectively which are consistent with the characteristics of the daily series the 3 h rainfall series of the cmorph product decreased gradually with time before df occurred and stabilized within 15 h after the df occurrence the mean accumulated rainfall of all dfs within 15 h was 50 6 mm rainfall also showed a gradual decreasing trend with time before the occurrence of df in the gpm mswep and persiann satellite products the rainfall 12 h prior to df estimated using the persiann gpm and mswep products were 90 0 87 5 and 39 6 mm respectively these satellite products also showed a relatively low crest 24 27 h prior to the occurrence of df which later stabilized after 36 h this result is inconsistent with that of cmorph however not all dfs were triggered by heavy rainfall on the day of or 12 h before df the aer also played a prominent role in triggering df at some sites this was analyzed in the later part of the aer the temporal variation in the box plot of the aer of all df sites estimated from satellite products is shown in fig 6 the aer estimated from gpm and persiann were generally higher than that estimated from cmorph and mswep the mean values of the aer on the df day for all sites were 78 5 and 62 9 mm in the gpm and persiann products respectively whereas the corresponding values of the cmorph and mswep were 40 2 and 35 8 mm respectively the temporal variation in aer was highly consistent among the four satellite products the aer of each product exhibited an increasing trend and then stabilized the magnitude of the increasing trend showed a gradual decreasing trend it generally includes two inflection points where the trend changes considerably the inflection points are the same for the gpm mswep and persiann products the two inflection points of these products occurred on days 6 and 10 after the df event the mean aer at all sites gradually increased from the df day the magnitude of the increase decreased to 2 0 and 1 0 mm d on days 6 and 10 respectively the mean aer of all sites tended to stabilize after day 14 with the magnitude of the increase decreasing to lower than 0 5 mm d two inflection points of cmorph occurred on days 2 and 8 the mean value of the aer stabilized after day 13 with the magnitude of the increase decreasing to 0 5 mm d overall a comprehensive analysis of the four satellite products showed that the aer of the first 6 10 and 14 days was critical to the dfs in the wrc fig 7 showed the critical daily rainfall triggering df rc day estimated from each satellite product the rc day was generally consistent in the gpm mswep and persiann products the rc day values varied between 50 and 150 mm at most df sites the rc day of the gpm was the highest in which the mean and median values for all df sites were 106 1 and 84 9 mm respectively the rc day of the cmorph was generally substantially lower than those of other products with mean and median values of only 44 9 and 24 0 mm respectively the rc day duration was consistent between the gpm and persiann and varied between one and six days fig 7b the median duration of all df sites was 2 days in the gpm and persiann products with corresponding mean values of 3 1 and 2 5 days respectively the duration of cmorph was concentrated for 2 3 days at 95 of df sites only a few df sites had a duration of 5 8 days the duration of mswep was considerably higher than those of other products with a range of 1 13 days and an average of 6 0 days the spatial distribution of the rc day at df sites and provinces is shown in fig 8 the rc day of cmorph was generally higher in the northern wrc than in other regions fig 8a which was higher than 50 mm at most df sites in the northern wrc especially in the northeastern regions the rc day was generally lower than 30 mm in central and southern regions especially in southern tibet and southern yunnan cmorph showed the highest rc day in inner mongolia and xinjiang with values of approximately 90 mm the lowest rc day was only 21 6 mm in yunnan the rc day of gpm was the highest among all the satellite products which exhibited an overall decreasing distribution from east to west fig 8b the rc day was generally higher than 100 mm at df sites located in the eastern wrc and was higher than 200 mm in eastern sichuan and the southeastern regions approximately half of the df sites in the western regions showed rc day between 30 and 50 mm the mean value of rc day was 100 mm in eastern provinces including shaanxi chongqing guizhou guangxi and yunnan the rc day of the mswep was lower in the northwest than in the southeast fig 8c it was lower than 50 mm at most df sites in the northern and western wrc and it was generally 50 mm in the southern and eastern regions especially in the eastern regions the mean values of rc day were 100 mm in the southern and eastern provinces with the highest value of 254 1 mm in guangxi rc day was lower than 50 mm in the northern and western provinces with the lowest value of 26 4 mm the rc day of persiann did not show an apparent regularity at the df sites fig 8d the mean value of rc day was the highest in qinghai 129 5 mm and the lowest in ningxia 26 5 mm overall the spatial distribution of rc day showed high consistency between gpm and mswep with a spatial correlation coefficient of 0 91 the rc day of cmorph generally showed the opposite spatial distribution compared with the other three products with a spatial correlation coefficient of approximately 0 50 fig 9 shows the spatial distribution of critical rainfall duration estimated by each satellite product at the df sites the cmorph duration was 2 3 days at most df sites and only a few sites had a duration of 4 8 days which were mainly located in the northeastern shaanxi and southwestern hengduan mountains fig 9a the duration of the persiann was also lower than 3 days at most df sites only 2 of df sites had a duration longer than 7 days which were mainly located in western sichuan and southern gansu the mean duration was the highest and lowest in inner mongolia 3 5 days and ningxia 1 0 days respectively the mswep duration was 7 days at 24 of the df sites 127 523 which were mainly distributed in the southern wrc the mean duration was between 1 5 and 11 5 days in each province and it was highest in yunnan tibet and guangxi with a mean value of 10 days the gpm duration was highest and lowest in tibet 6 4 days and gansu 1 7 days respectively only 7 34 523 of the df sites had a duration of 7 days which were mainly located in the hengduan mountains overall the critical rainfall duration of each satellite product was highly consistent in western sichuan with a duration of 3 days only a few df sites had a duration of 7 days in the mswep and gpm products which were mainly distributed in the south central and southeastern wrc 3 3 i d and e d curves of the wrc the evaluation of satellite precipitation products showed that gpm exhibited the best performance throughout the wrc fig 10 shows the i d and e d curves of wrc estimated from the gpm product it includes low medium and high early warning levels which were estimated by fitting the probability values of 5 25 and 75 respectively the r2 of each e d curve was approximately 0 95 whereas the r2 of the i d curves was below 0 80 the r2 value of the e d curve was much higher than that of the i d curve at each warning level this result indicates that the fitted e d curves had a higher reliability than the fitted i d curves for the entire wrc the i d curve is theoretically consistent with the e d curve that is the α value is equal and the sum of the absolute values of β is 1 for example the medium warnings in the i d and e d curves exhibited these characteristics however due to data limitations the number of df sites was limited to a certain duration therefore the probability values of the corresponding i intensity and e rainfall amount values might be different leading to inconsistencies in the parameter values of the fitted i d and e d curves for example the β values of the i d and e d curves at the low warning level conformed to the theoretical relationship but the corresponding α values differed by 5 the α values of the i d and e d curves at the high warning level differed by 10 and the sum of the absolute values of the corresponding β was 0 95 the 3 h rainfall intensity of the wrc was 4 9 7 8 and 15 0 mm h at the low medium and high early warning levels respectively the corresponding values at 24 h decreased to 3 4 4 5 and 7 2 mm h the intensity stabilized at 2 5 2 6 and 3 7 mm h after 7 d 168 h the low medium and high early warning rainfall values of the wrc were 52 7 mm at 15 h 52 4 mm at 9 h and 47 mm at 3 h respectively the r24hr of the three warning levels were 78 2 107 2 and 164 2 mm respectively the rainfall at 48 h corresponding to the three warning levels was 139 7 177 9 and 249 2 mm respectively the difference in the i d curves at the low medium and high warning levels showed a decreasing trend for example the 3 h rainfall intensity at the high warning level was three times that at the low warning level with a difference of 10 mm h the difference was reduced to 1 5 mm h at 120 h 5 days the difference in the 3 h rainfall intensity between the medium and low warning levels was 3 0 mm h and fell below 0 1 mm h after 7 days the r2 of i d and e d curves of the wrc fitted by the cmorph mswep and persiann was too low to be reliable due to numerous low critical rainfall values when only the critical rainfall of heavy rain 25 mm was used the r2 of the fitted curve was generally satisfied fig 11 shows the i d and e d curves of the wrc estimated by critical rainfall 25 mm from the cmorph mswep and persiann products the sample sites used for estimation accounted for 52 75 and 94 of the total df sites respectively the r2 of the e d curve was higher than that of the i d curve at each early warning level which corresponded to the same for the result estimated from the gpm product indicating that the reliability of the e d curve fitted by satellite precipitation was higher than that of the i d curve in the wrc for example the mean r2 of the e d curve fitted by the persiann was 0 92 whereas that of the i d curve was only 0 52 the i d curve estimated by the mswep r2 0 68 performed better than that fitted by the cmorph and persiann r2 0 52 the i d curves estimated by cmorph and persiann were consistent with those estimated from the gpm and were generally higher than the mswep curves at all warning levels the intensity of 3 h rainfall was similar between the cmorph and persiann products at the low 6 7 and 6 7 mm h medium 7 8 and 7 3 mm h and high 12 8 and 14 1 mm h warning levels respectively the difference between the medium and low warning intensity of the cmorph and persiann in each period was stable at approximately 1 0 mm h and 2 0 mm h respectively the difference between the high and low warning intensity showed a significant decreasing trend with the corresponding difference between the cmorph and persiann decreasing from 5 0 and 6 7 mm h at 3 h to 1 4 and 2 1 mm h at 7 d respectively thereafter it stabilized the e d curves fitted by persiann r2 0 92 and mswep r2 0 84 were significantly better than those fitted by cmorph r2 0 68 a low early warning level was achieved when the rainfall exceeded 50 mm at 12 and 18 h for the e d curves fitted by persiann and mswep respectively a medium early warning level was achieved when the rainfall at 9 h and 12 h exceeded 55 mm for persiann and mswep respectively these values were similar to the low and medium early warning levels estimated by the gpm which had rainfall exceeding 52 mm at 15 h and 9 h respectively the low medium and high 24 h early warning rainfall of the persiann curves were 79 7 125 9 and 216 6 mm respectively the corresponding values of the mswep curves were 58 8 83 5 and 142 9 mm respectively fig 12 shows the early warning rainfall of the wrc within 48 h estimated from the satellite products the warning rainfall for 3 h for the wrc ranged from 12 1 mm to 47 0 mm and the corresponding 25 and 75 values were 18 6 mm and 27 1 mm respectively the 24 h warning rainfall values were 73 3 and 130 1 mm at 25 and 75 percentile values respectively the lowest warning value was always present in the mswep curves whereas the highest value was generally found in the persiann curves the ratio of mean to standard deviation between the low and medium warning values of four products majorly ranged between 0 22 and 0 28 whereas the corresponding ratio between the low and high warning values varied between 0 30 and 0 35 this result indicated that the early warning rainfall at all durations was generally consistent among each product the mean warning rainfall in 3 h for all four products at the low medium and high levels were 16 5 20 9 and 37 mm respectively the corresponding 24 h warning rainfall values were 64 2 91 4 and 152 6 mm respectively for the low medium and high levels and the corresponding values in 48 h were 102 4 150 9 and 246 2 mm respectively the number of df events used for fitting i d and e d curves and the fitted r2 are shown in fig 12b 3 4 i d and e d curves of sub regions the wrc was divided into five regions according to the spatial distribution characteristics of the rtrig and administrative boundaries namely qtx qinghai tibet and xinjiang gins gansu inner mongolia ningxia and shaanxi cgg chongqing guizhou and guangxi yunnan and sichuan fig 1 fig 13 shows the i d and e d curves for all regions except qtx estimated from the gpm product the e d curve of each region showed high reliability with the fitted r2 being primarily 0 85 the reliability of the e d curve was the highest in sichuan with a fitted r2 of 0 90 for each early warning level the mean r2 of the i d curves for all warning levels was higher than 0 80 in each region with 0 93 being the highest value the mean r2 value in each region was greater than that of the entire wrc 0 76 this result indicates that the i d curve fitted in each region showed higher reliability than the wrc curve because the characteristics of rtrig were similar in each region the parameters of the i d and e d curves were consistent in each region that is the α value was equal and the sum of the absolute values of β was 1 the overall performance showed a minimal difference between the i d and e d curves with a mean r2 of 0 86 early warning rainfall was generally similar in gins and sichuan the low medium and high warning levels in gins and sichuan was observed when rainfall exceeded 50 mm at 8 and 10 5 and 6 and 3 and 3 h respectively the early 24 h warning rainfall triggering df in sichuan were 78 7 92 2 and 141 0 mm at the low medium and high warning levels respectively these values were consistent with the results obtained for the entire wrc the early warning rainfall of 24 h triggering df in the gins was slightly higher than that in the entire wrc which were 96 5 108 1 and 135 9 mm respectively the corresponding warning rainfall in yunnan was lower than that of the entire wrc with values of 70 2 79 6 and 127 5 mm respectively early warning rainfall was higher in the cgg than in the entire wrc and in other regions this phenomenon might be due to the strong precipitation in this area which is substantially higher than that in other regions the early 3 h warning rainfall triggering df in the cgg were 47 9 56 5 and 107 3 mm at the low medium and high warning levels respectively the corresponding 24 h values were 181 3 201 0 and 257 1 mm respectively the short term 9h rainfall intensity in each region was higher than that of the entire wrc at all early warning levels the early warning rainfall in the cgg was the highest the rainfall intensity of cgg at the low warning level was even higher than that of the other three regions at the high warning level when the duration was longer than 18 h the difference between the low warning rainfall of the cgg and the maximum value of the other three regions stabilized at approximately 1 7 mm h the i d curves of the high warning level were consistent in gins yunnan and sichuan with the standard deviation of the three curves being generally stable at approximately 0 2 mm h the difference in the medium warning curves among the three regions is also relatively small the standard deviation was approximately 0 5 mm h before 72 h which then decreased during 3 h the early warning rainfall intensity of gins yunnan and sichuan were approximately 20 13 0 and 8 0 mm h at the high medium and low warning levels respectively the corresponding values decreased to approximately 5 5 4 0 and 3 5 mm h during a 24 h period the i d and e d curves of the qtx and gins regions estimated by critical rainfall 25 mm from the cmorph and persiann products are shown in fig 14 the sampled sites of the two regions were 13 and 30 respectively the maximum fitted durations of the two regions were 18 and 48 h respectively other curves of regions estimated from satellite products were not shown due to the low fitted r2 0 40 for qtx the 6 h rainfall intensities were 5 9 8 3 and 12 8 mm h at the low medium and high warning levels respectively which were slightly higher than the corresponding values for the entire wrc furthermore the 18 h early warning rainfall was 65 6 74 7 and 120 3 mm at all three levels the i d curve of gins estimated from cmorph was approximately 2 0 mm h lower than that estimated from the gpm product which was mainly because the rtrig in cmorph was lower than that in the gpm product for sichuan the early warning rainfall for the short term 9h fitted by the persiann product was lower than that estimated from the gpm for each warning level when the duration was 9 h persiann early warning rainfall surpassed that of the gpm with the magnitude of the difference showing an increasing trend for example the warnings at 3 h rainfall estimated by persiann were 17 4 20 9 and 33 8 mm at the low medium and high warning levels respectively and these values were 11 6 16 0 and 22 7 mm lower than those estimated from the gpm product for sichuan the warnings at 24 h rainfall fitted by the persiann were 106 5 151 8 and 228 1 mm at all warning levels which were 27 8 59 6 and 87 1 mm higher than the gpm fitted values respectively 4 discussion 4 1 limitations and uncertainties currently gauge precipitation observation is the most direct and accurate measurement method however a major limitation is the insufficient coverage of the observation density the observed density of national weather stations used in this study was low in the wrc which was the primary reason for the challenges in capturing rtrig in the region and in the future more gauge observational data should be obtained for this region however several studies have found that even relatively dense rain gauge networks cannot depict the intensity and spatial extent of heavy precipitation smith et al 1996 scofield and kuligowski 2003 random errors and biases are the main sources of uncertainty in satellite precipitation measurements xie and arkin 1997 the estimates made from satellite observations contain non negligible random errors and biases due to the indirect nature of the relationship between observations and precipitation inadequate sampling and algorithm imperfections for example in most cases the sampled precipitation measurements were generally consistent between the two satellite products however a three hour deviation occurred which was the time step of the satellite products combined precipitation products from multiple satellites are more accurate and reliable than individual measurements for example the gpm product exhibited the best performance in the wrc is because it combined multi source satellite data to reduce random errors and integrated them with gauge observations to remove biases in general the more the df event data that can be acquired the stronger the representativeness of the region is in this study a total of 523 df sites in the wrc region were triggered by heavy rainfall and this dataset is representative of the wrc therefore the combination of the rainfall data of all df sites increases the importance and representativeness of the early warning rainfall conditions that trigger df in the wrc however the spatial distribution of the 523 df sites in the wrc varied considerably they were mainly concentrated in the eastern region of the wrc particularly in sichuan 363 523 and yunnan 67 523 whereas relatively fewer df sites are present in the western region which has a larger area for example only five and two df sites are located in tibet and qinghai regions respectively which indicates that the results of this study are more representative of the eastern wrc than of the western region thus further research is required to collect more df data from the western wrc to improve the representation of research results in this region the spatial scale of this study was relatively large the e d curves of the wrc and its sub regions are valuable for the early warning of dfs triggered by heavy rainfall however the early warning rainfall of dfs at smaller scales such as watershed scales must combine regional geological and topographic conditions with detailed rainfall data in addition a physical mechanism based model may be required to further study the triggering conditions of regional df and improve the early warning information of local df owing to data limitations this study only evaluated the ability of satellite products to capture heavy rainfall induced dfs further studies are required to comprehensively evaluate the ability of satellite products to capture precipitation occurrence and amount using multiple indices based on observed data series at meteorological stations 4 2 accuracy and applicability of global satellite precipitation products at regional scales at present there are many studies evaluating global satellite precipitation products in china most studies have shown that the gpm satellite product performs the best in china zhang et al 2020a tang et al 2020 kumar et al 2021 wei et al 2021 however compared with the humid and semi humid regions of eastern china its performance in the arid region of northwestern china is inferior zhang et al 2020a tang et al 2020 wei et al 2021 for example tang et al 2020 evaluated ten satellite and reanalysis products and found that the gpm product outperformed other datasets in china zhang et al 2020a found that the gpm performs better in humid regions than in semi arid regions and performs relatively worse in complex mountainous i e the qinghai tibet plateau and arid regions this study evaluated the ability of four global satellite precipitation products to capture rtrig in the wrc and the results of this study are consistent with these evaluation results this study found that the gpm product had the highest ability to capture rtrig however although it had a strong ability to capture rtrig in humid and semi humid regions its performance was relatively poor in western arid regions i e the qtx region the gpm is suitable for a mechanistic analysis of df induced by strong rainfall but cannot be applied to early warning because its latency is approximately three months cmorph mswep and persiann which comprise near real time estimates are highly useful for early warnings in areas lacking ground observations this study found that satellite precipitation products outperformed the ground observations of national meteorological stations in capturing rtrig in the wrc which was consistent with the conclusions of brunetti et al 2021 for india in addition this study found that the four satellite products showed complementary advantages in spatial distribution that is the regions with the best performance for each satellite product were different for example although the gpm product exhibited the best overall performance in the wrc it performed relatively poorly in xinjiang and tibet whereas cmorph and persiann showed the best performances in xinjiang and tibet respectively the combined performances of the four products were evaluated hence optimal products should be used when employing satellite precipitation products at a local scale in addition more studies should be conducted on the fusion of multi source satellite precipitation products such as the use of machine learning methods zhang et al 2021 to further improve the accuracy of satellite based measurements at a regional scale 4 3 comparison of early warning rainfall and e d curves between the wrc other regions and the world table 2 shows the e d curves and early warning rainfall within 48 h in the wrc and other regions overall the e d curves and early warning rainfall of the wrc were different and consistent with the global curve and those of the other regions the e d curves and warning values of number 4 9 were mostly equal to or higher than that of the wrc at the low warning level table 2 the e d curves estimated from sichuan number 7 and taiwan number 9 were much higher than those of the wrc for a high warning level the other curves varied between the low and high warning e d curves of the wrc the low warning e d curve of the wrc was similar to the global curve determined by hong and adler 2008 with the 24 h warning values of the two being similar the early warning rainfall of the wrc was lower than the global value within 24 h whereas the early warning value of the wrc within 48 h was approximately 20 mm higher than that of the global value the global e d curve proposed by caine 1980 is consistent with the medium warning e d curve of the wrc in the first 24 h the difference between the two warning values was approximately 3 mm whereas at 48 h the wrc warning value was 20 mm higher than the global value the e d curves and early warning values of the other regions 10 20 in table 2 were generally lower than the curve of the wrc for the low warning level for example the early warning rainfall of the global e d curve calibrated by guzzetti 2008 were only 13 0 and 19 2 mm during 24 and 48 h respectively the mean values of early warning rainfall of these e d curves were 16 7 26 0 33 2 and 43 0 mm at 3 12 24 and 48 h respectively these studies have used landslide based df data which might be one of the main reasons for the lower early warning rainfall values landslide based dfs are predominantly affected by geological and geomorphological conditions and rainfall is only a secondary trigger variations in the calibration samples are also one of the reasons for these differences for example seven e d curves for sichuan estimated from other studies table 2 were calibrated using limited df events in different small watersheds which led to large differences in the calibrated e d curves a considerable difference was observed between the adjacent watersheds in addition the different methods for estimating the e d i d curves were also one of the reasons for these mismatches for example in addition to the most commonly used method proposed by guzzetti et al 2007 some studies used the frequentist method brunetti et al 2010 which first fits the exponential curve for all df events the exponential morphology parameter β is then fixed and the translation curve is used to determine the corresponding parameter α for different probability values all df events used for the estimation of the i d curves by brunetti et al 2010 conformed to the exponential relationship however the i d or e d scatter plots of all df events used in this study did not conform to an exponential relationship with the fitted r2 of the curve being lower than 0 15 in contrast the fitted r2 values of the curves estimated using the methodology of this study were generally higher than 0 80 5 conclusion in this study a df inventory was developed containing over 523 df events triggered by heavy rainfall during 2000 2021 in the wrc based on this dataset rtrig was evaluated using gauge and satellite based precipitation measurements in the wrc the early warning rtrig was investigated from the i d and e d curves of the wrc and its subregions the ability of satellite products to capture rtrig data is generally higher than that of gauge observations the poor performance of the gauge observations was mainly due to the long distances between the meteorological stations and the df sites the ability of different satellite products to capture r24hr exhibited significant spatial variation the gpm showed the best overall performance throughout the wrc with a pod of 98 9 for heavy rainfall however it had a relatively poor ability to capture rtrig in the western region of the wrc although the overall performance of cmorph was relatively poor it showed the best performance in capturing rtrig in xinjiang which is the most inland region of china the overall performance of persiann was similar to that of gpm in addition it was the only satellite product with a pod of 100 in the qinghai tibet plateau which is the highest plateau on earth with an average altitude of 4000 m overall the four satellite precipitation products showed complementary advantages in the spatial distribution of the wrc the regions with the best performance for each satellite product differed therefore the combined ability of all satellite products showed perfect performance in capturing rtrig with a pod of 100 in capturing heavy rainfall for the 523 heavy rainfall events that caused the dfs in the wrc the combined ability of the four satellite products showed that the r24hr or rc3hr of the 521 df exceeded 50 mm the rc day estimated from gpm was the highest among the four satellite products which exhibited an overall decreasing trend from the east 100 mm to the west 50 mm the spatial distribution of rc day showed high consistency between gpm and mswep with a spatial correlation coefficient of 0 91 the rc day of the cmorph showed the opposite spatial distribution compared with the other three products with a spatial correlation coefficient of approximately 0 50 the critical rainfall duration estimated from the satellite products was 3 days in the wrc particularly in western sichuan the aer of the first 6 10 and 14 days was critical to the df in the wrc the e d curves of the wrc at low and medium early warning levels were consistent with the global e d curves estimated in other studies the early warning rainfall for each duration was mostly consistent for each product the mean warning rainfall of the wrc in 3 h estimated from the four products was 16 5 20 9 and 37 mm at the low medium and high levels respectively the corresponding warning rainfall values at 24 h were 64 2 91 4 and 152 6 mm respectively the i d curve fitted in each subregion showed higher reliability than the wrc curve with a fitted r2 higher than 0 80 the intensity of short term 9h rainfall in each region was higher than that in the entire wrc at all warning levels the early warning rtrig in the cgg was the highest which was generally similar in the gins and sichuan provinces the authors recommend using optimal products when employing satellite precipitation products at the local scale in addition more

1948,in recent years global satellite precipitation accuracy has improved considerably and their application have increased widely however research on rainfall thresholds of debris flows df particularly in china is insufficient in this study rainfall thresholds triggering df were evaluated in the western region of china wrc using four high resolution satellite based precipitation datasets combined with gauge measurements and a df inventory containing over 523 events for 2000 2021 the results showed that the ability of satellite products to capture rainfall triggering df rtrig was generally higher than that of gauge observations global precipitation measurement gpm showed the best overall performance throughout the wrc with a 98 9 probability of detection pod for heavy rainfall however it exhibited a relatively poor ability to capture rtrig in the western region of the wrc the four satellite products exhibit complementary advantages in terms of their spatial distribution the combined ability of all four satellite products perfectly captured rtrig with a pod of 100 over the wrc the critical daily rtrig estimated from gpm was the highest which exhibited an overall decreasing trend from the east 100 mm to the west 50 mm in the wrc the critical rainfall duration estimated from satellite products was generally less than three days in the wrc particularly in western sichuan the antecedent effective rainfall of the first 6 10 and 14 days was critical for triggering df in the wrc the critical rainfall event duration e d curves of the wrc at low and medium early warning levels were consistent with the global e d curves estimated from other studies the mean early warning rainfall of the wrc at 3 h estimated from the four products was 16 5 20 9 and 37 mm at the low medium and high levels respectively the corresponding warning rainfall values at 24 h were 64 2 91 4 and 152 6 mm for low medium and high levels respectively the critical rainfall intensity duration curve fitted in each subregion showed a higher reliability than the curve of the wrc with a fitted r2 higher than 0 80 the short term 9h rainfall intensity in each region was higher than that of the entire wrc at all early warning levels a combination of multi source satellite precipitation products is recommended to further improve the accuracy of satellite based measurements at the local scale keywords critical rainfall intensity duration curve early warning satellite precipitation tibetan plateau xinjiang hengduan mountains data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction debris flows dfs are severe hazards in mountainous regions that threaten human life and property stanley and kirschbaum 2017 mostbauer et al 2018 li et al 2021 yu et al 2021 dfs are destructive because of their high speed ability to transport large objects and capability of burying entire cities and killing tens of thousands of people in a single event dowling and santi 2014 banihabib and forghani 2017 mountainous areas of china account for 69 4 of the country s total land area and are mainly located in the western region peng et al 2015 each year the dfs in this region cause hundreds of deaths and direct economic losses of billions of yuan a widespread consensus exists that rainfall is the primary trigger of dfs dowling and santi 2014 abancó et al 2016 bogaard and greco 2016 marra et al 2017 stanley and kirschbaum 2017 mostbauer et al 2018 berti et al 2020 long et al 2020 rainfall thresholds are fundamental for forecasting rainfall triggered df hazards and early warning systems which can save lives and property abancó et al 2016 berti et al 2020 li et al 2021 rainfall thresholds can be defined through either physical or empirical models guzzetti et al 2008 robbins 2016 brunetti et al 2018 physically based models aim to explain the dynamic processes and require a considerable volume of detailed input data such data are often difficult to acquire particularly for large areas robbins 2016 therefore empirically derived thresholds have been widely used to forecast dfs at regional and global scales robbins 2016 berti et al 2020 numerous empirical rainfall thresholds have been proposed at global regional and local scales in previous studies guzzetti et al 2008 segoni et al 2018 empirical models use statistical approaches based on historical df catalogues to identify the relationship between rainfall parameters and dfs robbins 2016 rainfall parameters generally include cumulative rainfall antecedent effective rainfall rainfall intensity and rainfall duration robbins 2016 zhao et al 2022 the most common combinations of parameters are intensity duration rainfall event duration and antecedent rainfall conditions segoni et al 2018 accurate rainfall measurements and detailed df catalogues are essential for the development of rainfall thresholds ebert et al 2007 robbins 2016 rain gauge observations near df initiation areas are typically applied to identify rainfall thresholds triggering dfs abancó et al 2016 however two problems are present in the application of gauge observations first precipitation has considerable spatial heterogeneity in mountainous areas prone to dfs nikolopoulos et al 2014 abancó et al 2016 marra et al 2017 for example the daily precipitation was 23 5 mm and 229 6 mm at two stations within 20 km and differed fivefold within 10 km yang et al 2020 in addition gauge rainfall is underestimated by up to 40 at 6 7 km distances nikolopoulos et al 2015 second rain gauge networks are not available in most developing countries especially in mountainous areas resulting in inadequacy in this method for supporting threshold analysis long et al 2020 compared with eastern china the density of the rain gauge network in western china is extremely low to support the threshold analyses when no reliable rain gauge network exists in the study area satellite based measurements are the best available option robbins 2016 marra et al 2017 segoni et al 2018 brunetti et al 2021 satellite based measurements can effectively combat the problem of insufficient spatial resolution of precipitation in mountainous areas with complex terrain because they monitor area rainfall in other words the satellite based measurements directly represent the rainfall over a specific area the increased availability consistency and high spatiotemporal resolution of these data allow for broad scale global regional country and catchment level df hazard assessments that are not limited by inaccessibility due to terrain culture or politics robbins 2016 segoni et al 2018 brunetti et al 2021 satellite based precipitation data has been widely used in recent years several studies have applied tropical rainfall measurement mission multi satellite precipitation analysis products to identify rainfall thresholds that trigger shallow landslides and dfs hong and adler 2008 kirschbaum et al 2012 nikolopoulos et al 2017 random errors and biases are the major problems associated with satellite based precipitation estimates xie and arkin 1997 the latest satellite based precipitation products are increasingly accurate and reliable because they combine multi satellite data to reduce random errors and are blended with gauge observations to remove bias integrated multi satellite retrieval imerg products from the global precipitation measurement gpm mission generally exhibit the best performance compared with other satellite based precipitation products at global and regional scales huffman et al 2019 chen et al 2020 including australia islam et al 2020 bangladesh montes et al 2021 eastern himalayas kumar et al 2021 and nigeria nwachukwu et al 2020 evaluations have also shown that the gpm is the best satellite product in china chen et al 2020 tang et al 2020 zhang et al 2020a 2021 wei et al 2021 segoni et al 2018 reviewed the literature on rainfall thresholds for shallow landslides and df occurrences and recommended the use of satellite based measurements to determine df triggered rainfall thresholds however research on rainfall thresholds of dfs using satellite based data remains limited this study evaluated rainfall thresholds triggering dfs using gauged and satellite based precipitation measurements and a df dataset for the western region of china wrc to achieve three key objectives 1 develop a df inventory that contains over 523 df events triggered by heavy rainfall during the 2000 2021 period in the wrc 2 evaluate the ability of gauged and satellite based precipitation measurements to capture heavy rainfall triggering dfs in the wrc and 3 identify the critical rainfall intensity duration i d and critical rainfall event duration e d curves of the wrc and investigate early warning rainfall triggering dfs in the wrc and its sub regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 data 2 1 1 the df catalogue the database used in this study was collated using df event information from the china flood and drought disaster bulletin national geological disaster notification flood and drought bulletins of each province journal publications online news and social media these data sources validated and complemented each other data on landslide disasters were excluded and only df data were used the 523 df events that occurred in the wrc were selected for further analysis fig 1 and these df events were mainly triggered by heavy rainfall the information included the location time of occurrence and number of affected people 2 1 2 gauge observed precipitation data the gauge observed precipitation data provided by the national climate center of the china meteorological administration included a continuous data series from 1951 to 2018 there are 834 meteorological stations in china the raw dataset consisted of 12 h 8p m to 8 a m and 8 a m to 8p m and 24 h 8p m to 8p m precipitation data in beijing the raw data based on local time were converted into data based on coordinated universal time utc for comparison with the satellite based products the utc equals the beijing time minus 8 h 2 1 3 satellite based precipitation products four satellite based precipitation products were used in the study the climate prediction center morphing technique cmorph bias corrected satellite precipitation product joyce and xie 2011 was obtained from january 1998 to december 2020 at a resolution of 8 km the gpm imerg final run v 06 is a level 3 precipitation product huffman et al 2019 which uses multiple passive microwave satellite sensors to measure precipitation the algorithm was combined with precipitation gauge analyses microwave calibrated infrared satellite estimates and other precipitation estimators at a fine spatial resolution 0 1 the data series used in this study spanned from june 2006 to december 2020 the multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswep product merges the gauge satellite and reanalysis data and has a 0 1 resolution beck et al 2019 the precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks persiann product is a real time high resolution 0 04 satellite precipitation product developed by the center for hydrometeorology and remote sensing at the university of california irvine nguyen et al 2019 the data used were from june 2003 to december 2020 the four satellite products had a 3 hourly series cmorph mswep and persiann comprise near real time estimates with a latency of 3 h whereas the gpm has a latency of approximately three months 2 2 methods 2 2 1 definition of critical rainfall events triggering dfs a rainfall event is defined as a rainfall record between two adjacent rainless periods 3 and 24 h rainless periods are defined as rainfall lower than 0 5 mm and 1 mm in 3 h and 24 h respectively runoff generated by rainfall below these thresholds has minimal influence on dfs and is negligible the rainfall events in which df occurs are defined as critical rainfall events the rainfall parameters included critical rainfall intensity cumulative rainfall antecedent effective rainfall aer also called the antecedent precipitation index and duration the critical rainfall parameters were defined according to leonarduzzi et al 2017 2 2 2 performance statistics for capturing rainfall triggering dfs based on the catalogue of 523 df events triggered by heavy rainfall the ability of meteorological observation stations and satellite products to capture rainfall triggering df rtrig was evaluated in the wrc the evaluation focused on three parameters 24 h rainfall r24hr critical 3 h rainfall rc3hr and their combination owing to the lack of accessible hourly rainfall data the r24hr at the meteorological station was the sum of the 12 h rainfall at df occurrence and the previous 12 h rainfall the r24hr was divided into moderate heavy storm and heavy storm levels which were defined as 10 r24hr 25 mm 25 r24hr 50 mm 50 r24hr 100 mm and r24hr 100 mm respectively in the evaluation of the combined performance it shows ability to capture rtrig if it is captured by r24hr or rc3hr the combined performance of multiple products in capturing rtrig is similar that is it shows ability to capture rtrig if it is captured by any of the products the probability of detection pod which provides the fraction of rain occurrences that were correctly detected ebert et al 2007 was used to evaluate the ability of the gauged or satellite based measurements to capture rtrig the pod was calculated as follows 1 pod h h m where h is the rtrig correctly detected by gauged or satellite products and m is the undetected rtrig 2 2 3 calculation of the aer i d and e d curves the most common combinations for identifying rainfall thresholds segoni et al 2018 were used by determining the follows 1 i d curve 2 e d curve and 3 aer the aer is expressed as follows 2 p ae p 0 i 1 n k i p i where pae is the aer p 0 represents rainfall on the day of df occurrence and p i is the rainfall on the i th day before df occurs k i p i represents the effective rainfall on the i th day according to empirical local settings k was set as 0 84 liu et al 2020 li et al 2022 the i d and e d curves are expressed follows 3 i α 1 d β 1 4 e α 2 d β 2 where i is the critical rainfall intensity mm h e is critical rainfall mm d is the duration h and α and β are the parameters of the curve the i d and e d curves in this study were determined using the critical rainfall corresponding to the df events fig 2 the method for determining the i d and e d curves was based on that described by guzzetti et al 2007 the steps were as follows 1 the closest pixel to each df was selected for each satellite product and the critical rainfall amount e intensity i and duration d were calculated according to fig 2a 2 a scatter plot of the i d or e d data was drawn 3 for each d if the number of df events in this duration was greater than three the probability values 5 25 and 75 of i or e in this duration were calculated 4 for the calculated probability values exponential i d or e d curves were fitted using the least squares method these three probability values represent low medium and high early warning levels respectively 5 rainfall thresholds triggering df were analyzed at these three early warning levels 3 results 3 1 evaluation of the gauge and satellite based measurement abilities in capturing rtrig the ability of gauge and satellite based measurements to capture rtrig was evaluated using the df dataset the evaluation results are presented in table 1 gauge observations captured moderate and heavy rain with pods of 87 5 and 60 8 respectively however it did not effectively capture heavy storm rain pod 4 4 in general the ability of satellite based measurements to capture rtrig was higher than that of gauge observations particularly for gpm persiann and mswep products gpm showed the best performance with pod of 99 6 and 98 9 for moderate and heavy rainfall respectively the combined ability to capture r24hr or rc3hr 50 mm was 91 6 the performance of persiann was similar to that of gpm however the ability of persiann to capture heavy rain was better than that of the gpm and it was also the highest among all satellite products this result was mainly because the extreme rainfall captured by persiann was generally higher than that of gpm compared with the persiann and gpm products mswep was only able to capture moderate rainfall with comparable pod the pod of r24hr combined with rc3hr was only 67 9 which was much lower than those of both gpm and persiann cmorph showed the most inferior performance among all satellites with a pod generally lower than the other three satellite products it only showed a greater ability than mswep to capture heavy storm rainfall the combined ability of all the satellite products perfectly captured rtrig with a pod of 100 for capturing moderate or heavy rainfall the pod of all satellite products for capturing r24hr or rc3hr 50 mm was 99 6 in other words among the 523 heavy rainfall events that caused dfs in the wrc the combined results of the four satellite products showed that r24hr or rc3hr of 521 dfs exceeded 50 mm as the four satellite products complement each other the combined satellite products could accurately represent the actual rainfall of the wrc fig 3 shows the spatial distribution of r24hr before df estimation from the gauged and satellite products the r24hr of gauge observations was generally low especially in the western and northern regions for example it was generally lower than 10 mm in the xingjiang gansu inner mongolia and ningxia provinces the r24hr of gauge observation was greatly affected by the distance between the monitoring site and the df location fig 1 which was generally over 70 km in addition even if the distance is 10 km a substantial difference in rainfall exists due to impacts of local terrain factors therefore even gauges show poor performances while capturing rtrig because of irregular terrain the ability of the different satellite products to capture r24hr showed substantial spatial variation although the overall performance of cmorph was relatively poor its r24hr in xinjiang the most far reaching inland region of china was considerably higher than those of the other satellite products with an average of 144 6 mm cmorph had a higher r24hr in the northern region than in the southern region compared with the other products the r24hr of gpm predominantly captured storm or heavy storm rainfall levels a few df sites had r24hr lower than 50 mm which were mainly located in the western region of the wrc the r24hr gradually increased from west to east the mean r24hr of the df sites was 60 mm in each province heavy storm levels were experienced in most provinces except for xinjiang tibet and inner mongolia the mean values of r24hr were relatively high in guizhou 169 2 mm chongqing 199 9 mm and guangxi 215 3 mm the overall performance of persiann was similar to that of gpm however its spatial distribution differs from that of gpm the r24hr of persiann was higher than that of the other satellite products in tibet which reached a heavy storm level at each df site with an average value of 126 0 mm the r24hr of the mswep gradually increased from west to east which this is consistent with the spatial distribution of the gpm however its value is generally lower than that of the gpm the 25 frequency value of r24hr for all satellite products was approximately 50 mm fig 4 shows the spatial distribution of the combined ability of satellite products in capturing r24hr or rc3hr 50 mm the cmorph had a strong ability to capture storm rain in the northwestern region of the wrc fig 4 a it showed perfect performance in xinjiang inner mongolia and ningxia with a pod of 100 however its performance was relatively poor in most provinces 7 12 with a pod below 50 the combined ability of the mswep was better in the eastern wrc than in the western wrc fig 4c it showed perfect performances in guangxi guizhou and inner mongolia with a pod of 100 however its pod was lower than 50 in western provinces such as xinjiang ningxia gansu qinghai and gansu persiann was also generally able to capture storm rainfall in the wrc fig 4d its pod was 75 in most provinces 11 12 except for inner mongolia persiann was the only satellite product with a pod of 100 in the qinghai tibet plateau the pod was also 100 in ningxia and guizhou the gpm showed the strongest ability in capturing r24hr or rc3hr 50 mm in the wrc fig 4b persiann showed the lowest capturing ability in tibet with a pod of 80 and had a perfect performance in most provinces 7 12 with a pod of 100 the gpm had an inferior performance at a few df sites that were mainly located in the hengduan mountains region the four satellite products complemented each other in terms of their spatial distribution the combined ability of all the products was also analyzed fig 4e and the results show that r24hr or rc3hr 50 mm were captured at almost all df sites 522 523 the performance of the satellite products showed high consistency in capturing rainfall over 50 mm at 23 of the sites 122 523 these sites are mainly located in the surrounding areas of the sichuan basin southern gansu and eastern shaanxi less than three products at each site which were widely distributed throughout the wrc had the ability to capture rainfall 50 mm 3 2 spatial and temporal distribution of rtrig estimated from satellite products the temporal changes in satellite rainfall during df occurrence and its early stages at all df sites are shown in fig 5 the rtrig of the wrc estimated from the satellite products mainly occurred on the df day when it was considerably higher than those on the other days for all df sites the mean and median values of rainfall on the df day varied between 21 6 and 78 5 mm d and 12 5 64 2 mm d respectively gpm and cmorph had the highest and lowest values respectively according to the 3 h series rtrig was mainly concentrated in the first 12 h of df all satellite products showed the highest rainfall at 3 h when df occurred the mean and median for 3 h rainfall varied between 14 6 and 41 5 mm 3h and 10 6 36 4 mm 3h respectively gpm and cmorph had the highest and lowest values respectively which are consistent with the characteristics of the daily series the 3 h rainfall series of the cmorph product decreased gradually with time before df occurred and stabilized within 15 h after the df occurrence the mean accumulated rainfall of all dfs within 15 h was 50 6 mm rainfall also showed a gradual decreasing trend with time before the occurrence of df in the gpm mswep and persiann satellite products the rainfall 12 h prior to df estimated using the persiann gpm and mswep products were 90 0 87 5 and 39 6 mm respectively these satellite products also showed a relatively low crest 24 27 h prior to the occurrence of df which later stabilized after 36 h this result is inconsistent with that of cmorph however not all dfs were triggered by heavy rainfall on the day of or 12 h before df the aer also played a prominent role in triggering df at some sites this was analyzed in the later part of the aer the temporal variation in the box plot of the aer of all df sites estimated from satellite products is shown in fig 6 the aer estimated from gpm and persiann were generally higher than that estimated from cmorph and mswep the mean values of the aer on the df day for all sites were 78 5 and 62 9 mm in the gpm and persiann products respectively whereas the corresponding values of the cmorph and mswep were 40 2 and 35 8 mm respectively the temporal variation in aer was highly consistent among the four satellite products the aer of each product exhibited an increasing trend and then stabilized the magnitude of the increasing trend showed a gradual decreasing trend it generally includes two inflection points where the trend changes considerably the inflection points are the same for the gpm mswep and persiann products the two inflection points of these products occurred on days 6 and 10 after the df event the mean aer at all sites gradually increased from the df day the magnitude of the increase decreased to 2 0 and 1 0 mm d on days 6 and 10 respectively the mean aer of all sites tended to stabilize after day 14 with the magnitude of the increase decreasing to lower than 0 5 mm d two inflection points of cmorph occurred on days 2 and 8 the mean value of the aer stabilized after day 13 with the magnitude of the increase decreasing to 0 5 mm d overall a comprehensive analysis of the four satellite products showed that the aer of the first 6 10 and 14 days was critical to the dfs in the wrc fig 7 showed the critical daily rainfall triggering df rc day estimated from each satellite product the rc day was generally consistent in the gpm mswep and persiann products the rc day values varied between 50 and 150 mm at most df sites the rc day of the gpm was the highest in which the mean and median values for all df sites were 106 1 and 84 9 mm respectively the rc day of the cmorph was generally substantially lower than those of other products with mean and median values of only 44 9 and 24 0 mm respectively the rc day duration was consistent between the gpm and persiann and varied between one and six days fig 7b the median duration of all df sites was 2 days in the gpm and persiann products with corresponding mean values of 3 1 and 2 5 days respectively the duration of cmorph was concentrated for 2 3 days at 95 of df sites only a few df sites had a duration of 5 8 days the duration of mswep was considerably higher than those of other products with a range of 1 13 days and an average of 6 0 days the spatial distribution of the rc day at df sites and provinces is shown in fig 8 the rc day of cmorph was generally higher in the northern wrc than in other regions fig 8a which was higher than 50 mm at most df sites in the northern wrc especially in the northeastern regions the rc day was generally lower than 30 mm in central and southern regions especially in southern tibet and southern yunnan cmorph showed the highest rc day in inner mongolia and xinjiang with values of approximately 90 mm the lowest rc day was only 21 6 mm in yunnan the rc day of gpm was the highest among all the satellite products which exhibited an overall decreasing distribution from east to west fig 8b the rc day was generally higher than 100 mm at df sites located in the eastern wrc and was higher than 200 mm in eastern sichuan and the southeastern regions approximately half of the df sites in the western regions showed rc day between 30 and 50 mm the mean value of rc day was 100 mm in eastern provinces including shaanxi chongqing guizhou guangxi and yunnan the rc day of the mswep was lower in the northwest than in the southeast fig 8c it was lower than 50 mm at most df sites in the northern and western wrc and it was generally 50 mm in the southern and eastern regions especially in the eastern regions the mean values of rc day were 100 mm in the southern and eastern provinces with the highest value of 254 1 mm in guangxi rc day was lower than 50 mm in the northern and western provinces with the lowest value of 26 4 mm the rc day of persiann did not show an apparent regularity at the df sites fig 8d the mean value of rc day was the highest in qinghai 129 5 mm and the lowest in ningxia 26 5 mm overall the spatial distribution of rc day showed high consistency between gpm and mswep with a spatial correlation coefficient of 0 91 the rc day of cmorph generally showed the opposite spatial distribution compared with the other three products with a spatial correlation coefficient of approximately 0 50 fig 9 shows the spatial distribution of critical rainfall duration estimated by each satellite product at the df sites the cmorph duration was 2 3 days at most df sites and only a few sites had a duration of 4 8 days which were mainly located in the northeastern shaanxi and southwestern hengduan mountains fig 9a the duration of the persiann was also lower than 3 days at most df sites only 2 of df sites had a duration longer than 7 days which were mainly located in western sichuan and southern gansu the mean duration was the highest and lowest in inner mongolia 3 5 days and ningxia 1 0 days respectively the mswep duration was 7 days at 24 of the df sites 127 523 which were mainly distributed in the southern wrc the mean duration was between 1 5 and 11 5 days in each province and it was highest in yunnan tibet and guangxi with a mean value of 10 days the gpm duration was highest and lowest in tibet 6 4 days and gansu 1 7 days respectively only 7 34 523 of the df sites had a duration of 7 days which were mainly located in the hengduan mountains overall the critical rainfall duration of each satellite product was highly consistent in western sichuan with a duration of 3 days only a few df sites had a duration of 7 days in the mswep and gpm products which were mainly distributed in the south central and southeastern wrc 3 3 i d and e d curves of the wrc the evaluation of satellite precipitation products showed that gpm exhibited the best performance throughout the wrc fig 10 shows the i d and e d curves of wrc estimated from the gpm product it includes low medium and high early warning levels which were estimated by fitting the probability values of 5 25 and 75 respectively the r2 of each e d curve was approximately 0 95 whereas the r2 of the i d curves was below 0 80 the r2 value of the e d curve was much higher than that of the i d curve at each warning level this result indicates that the fitted e d curves had a higher reliability than the fitted i d curves for the entire wrc the i d curve is theoretically consistent with the e d curve that is the α value is equal and the sum of the absolute values of β is 1 for example the medium warnings in the i d and e d curves exhibited these characteristics however due to data limitations the number of df sites was limited to a certain duration therefore the probability values of the corresponding i intensity and e rainfall amount values might be different leading to inconsistencies in the parameter values of the fitted i d and e d curves for example the β values of the i d and e d curves at the low warning level conformed to the theoretical relationship but the corresponding α values differed by 5 the α values of the i d and e d curves at the high warning level differed by 10 and the sum of the absolute values of the corresponding β was 0 95 the 3 h rainfall intensity of the wrc was 4 9 7 8 and 15 0 mm h at the low medium and high early warning levels respectively the corresponding values at 24 h decreased to 3 4 4 5 and 7 2 mm h the intensity stabilized at 2 5 2 6 and 3 7 mm h after 7 d 168 h the low medium and high early warning rainfall values of the wrc were 52 7 mm at 15 h 52 4 mm at 9 h and 47 mm at 3 h respectively the r24hr of the three warning levels were 78 2 107 2 and 164 2 mm respectively the rainfall at 48 h corresponding to the three warning levels was 139 7 177 9 and 249 2 mm respectively the difference in the i d curves at the low medium and high warning levels showed a decreasing trend for example the 3 h rainfall intensity at the high warning level was three times that at the low warning level with a difference of 10 mm h the difference was reduced to 1 5 mm h at 120 h 5 days the difference in the 3 h rainfall intensity between the medium and low warning levels was 3 0 mm h and fell below 0 1 mm h after 7 days the r2 of i d and e d curves of the wrc fitted by the cmorph mswep and persiann was too low to be reliable due to numerous low critical rainfall values when only the critical rainfall of heavy rain 25 mm was used the r2 of the fitted curve was generally satisfied fig 11 shows the i d and e d curves of the wrc estimated by critical rainfall 25 mm from the cmorph mswep and persiann products the sample sites used for estimation accounted for 52 75 and 94 of the total df sites respectively the r2 of the e d curve was higher than that of the i d curve at each early warning level which corresponded to the same for the result estimated from the gpm product indicating that the reliability of the e d curve fitted by satellite precipitation was higher than that of the i d curve in the wrc for example the mean r2 of the e d curve fitted by the persiann was 0 92 whereas that of the i d curve was only 0 52 the i d curve estimated by the mswep r2 0 68 performed better than that fitted by the cmorph and persiann r2 0 52 the i d curves estimated by cmorph and persiann were consistent with those estimated from the gpm and were generally higher than the mswep curves at all warning levels the intensity of 3 h rainfall was similar between the cmorph and persiann products at the low 6 7 and 6 7 mm h medium 7 8 and 7 3 mm h and high 12 8 and 14 1 mm h warning levels respectively the difference between the medium and low warning intensity of the cmorph and persiann in each period was stable at approximately 1 0 mm h and 2 0 mm h respectively the difference between the high and low warning intensity showed a significant decreasing trend with the corresponding difference between the cmorph and persiann decreasing from 5 0 and 6 7 mm h at 3 h to 1 4 and 2 1 mm h at 7 d respectively thereafter it stabilized the e d curves fitted by persiann r2 0 92 and mswep r2 0 84 were significantly better than those fitted by cmorph r2 0 68 a low early warning level was achieved when the rainfall exceeded 50 mm at 12 and 18 h for the e d curves fitted by persiann and mswep respectively a medium early warning level was achieved when the rainfall at 9 h and 12 h exceeded 55 mm for persiann and mswep respectively these values were similar to the low and medium early warning levels estimated by the gpm which had rainfall exceeding 52 mm at 15 h and 9 h respectively the low medium and high 24 h early warning rainfall of the persiann curves were 79 7 125 9 and 216 6 mm respectively the corresponding values of the mswep curves were 58 8 83 5 and 142 9 mm respectively fig 12 shows the early warning rainfall of the wrc within 48 h estimated from the satellite products the warning rainfall for 3 h for the wrc ranged from 12 1 mm to 47 0 mm and the corresponding 25 and 75 values were 18 6 mm and 27 1 mm respectively the 24 h warning rainfall values were 73 3 and 130 1 mm at 25 and 75 percentile values respectively the lowest warning value was always present in the mswep curves whereas the highest value was generally found in the persiann curves the ratio of mean to standard deviation between the low and medium warning values of four products majorly ranged between 0 22 and 0 28 whereas the corresponding ratio between the low and high warning values varied between 0 30 and 0 35 this result indicated that the early warning rainfall at all durations was generally consistent among each product the mean warning rainfall in 3 h for all four products at the low medium and high levels were 16 5 20 9 and 37 mm respectively the corresponding 24 h warning rainfall values were 64 2 91 4 and 152 6 mm respectively for the low medium and high levels and the corresponding values in 48 h were 102 4 150 9 and 246 2 mm respectively the number of df events used for fitting i d and e d curves and the fitted r2 are shown in fig 12b 3 4 i d and e d curves of sub regions the wrc was divided into five regions according to the spatial distribution characteristics of the rtrig and administrative boundaries namely qtx qinghai tibet and xinjiang gins gansu inner mongolia ningxia and shaanxi cgg chongqing guizhou and guangxi yunnan and sichuan fig 1 fig 13 shows the i d and e d curves for all regions except qtx estimated from the gpm product the e d curve of each region showed high reliability with the fitted r2 being primarily 0 85 the reliability of the e d curve was the highest in sichuan with a fitted r2 of 0 90 for each early warning level the mean r2 of the i d curves for all warning levels was higher than 0 80 in each region with 0 93 being the highest value the mean r2 value in each region was greater than that of the entire wrc 0 76 this result indicates that the i d curve fitted in each region showed higher reliability than the wrc curve because the characteristics of rtrig were similar in each region the parameters of the i d and e d curves were consistent in each region that is the α value was equal and the sum of the absolute values of β was 1 the overall performance showed a minimal difference between the i d and e d curves with a mean r2 of 0 86 early warning rainfall was generally similar in gins and sichuan the low medium and high warning levels in gins and sichuan was observed when rainfall exceeded 50 mm at 8 and 10 5 and 6 and 3 and 3 h respectively the early 24 h warning rainfall triggering df in sichuan were 78 7 92 2 and 141 0 mm at the low medium and high warning levels respectively these values were consistent with the results obtained for the entire wrc the early warning rainfall of 24 h triggering df in the gins was slightly higher than that in the entire wrc which were 96 5 108 1 and 135 9 mm respectively the corresponding warning rainfall in yunnan was lower than that of the entire wrc with values of 70 2 79 6 and 127 5 mm respectively early warning rainfall was higher in the cgg than in the entire wrc and in other regions this phenomenon might be due to the strong precipitation in this area which is substantially higher than that in other regions the early 3 h warning rainfall triggering df in the cgg were 47 9 56 5 and 107 3 mm at the low medium and high warning levels respectively the corresponding 24 h values were 181 3 201 0 and 257 1 mm respectively the short term 9h rainfall intensity in each region was higher than that of the entire wrc at all early warning levels the early warning rainfall in the cgg was the highest the rainfall intensity of cgg at the low warning level was even higher than that of the other three regions at the high warning level when the duration was longer than 18 h the difference between the low warning rainfall of the cgg and the maximum value of the other three regions stabilized at approximately 1 7 mm h the i d curves of the high warning level were consistent in gins yunnan and sichuan with the standard deviation of the three curves being generally stable at approximately 0 2 mm h the difference in the medium warning curves among the three regions is also relatively small the standard deviation was approximately 0 5 mm h before 72 h which then decreased during 3 h the early warning rainfall intensity of gins yunnan and sichuan were approximately 20 13 0 and 8 0 mm h at the high medium and low warning levels respectively the corresponding values decreased to approximately 5 5 4 0 and 3 5 mm h during a 24 h period the i d and e d curves of the qtx and gins regions estimated by critical rainfall 25 mm from the cmorph and persiann products are shown in fig 14 the sampled sites of the two regions were 13 and 30 respectively the maximum fitted durations of the two regions were 18 and 48 h respectively other curves of regions estimated from satellite products were not shown due to the low fitted r2 0 40 for qtx the 6 h rainfall intensities were 5 9 8 3 and 12 8 mm h at the low medium and high warning levels respectively which were slightly higher than the corresponding values for the entire wrc furthermore the 18 h early warning rainfall was 65 6 74 7 and 120 3 mm at all three levels the i d curve of gins estimated from cmorph was approximately 2 0 mm h lower than that estimated from the gpm product which was mainly because the rtrig in cmorph was lower than that in the gpm product for sichuan the early warning rainfall for the short term 9h fitted by the persiann product was lower than that estimated from the gpm for each warning level when the duration was 9 h persiann early warning rainfall surpassed that of the gpm with the magnitude of the difference showing an increasing trend for example the warnings at 3 h rainfall estimated by persiann were 17 4 20 9 and 33 8 mm at the low medium and high warning levels respectively and these values were 11 6 16 0 and 22 7 mm lower than those estimated from the gpm product for sichuan the warnings at 24 h rainfall fitted by the persiann were 106 5 151 8 and 228 1 mm at all warning levels which were 27 8 59 6 and 87 1 mm higher than the gpm fitted values respectively 4 discussion 4 1 limitations and uncertainties currently gauge precipitation observation is the most direct and accurate measurement method however a major limitation is the insufficient coverage of the observation density the observed density of national weather stations used in this study was low in the wrc which was the primary reason for the challenges in capturing rtrig in the region and in the future more gauge observational data should be obtained for this region however several studies have found that even relatively dense rain gauge networks cannot depict the intensity and spatial extent of heavy precipitation smith et al 1996 scofield and kuligowski 2003 random errors and biases are the main sources of uncertainty in satellite precipitation measurements xie and arkin 1997 the estimates made from satellite observations contain non negligible random errors and biases due to the indirect nature of the relationship between observations and precipitation inadequate sampling and algorithm imperfections for example in most cases the sampled precipitation measurements were generally consistent between the two satellite products however a three hour deviation occurred which was the time step of the satellite products combined precipitation products from multiple satellites are more accurate and reliable than individual measurements for example the gpm product exhibited the best performance in the wrc is because it combined multi source satellite data to reduce random errors and integrated them with gauge observations to remove biases in general the more the df event data that can be acquired the stronger the representativeness of the region is in this study a total of 523 df sites in the wrc region were triggered by heavy rainfall and this dataset is representative of the wrc therefore the combination of the rainfall data of all df sites increases the importance and representativeness of the early warning rainfall conditions that trigger df in the wrc however the spatial distribution of the 523 df sites in the wrc varied considerably they were mainly concentrated in the eastern region of the wrc particularly in sichuan 363 523 and yunnan 67 523 whereas relatively fewer df sites are present in the western region which has a larger area for example only five and two df sites are located in tibet and qinghai regions respectively which indicates that the results of this study are more representative of the eastern wrc than of the western region thus further research is required to collect more df data from the western wrc to improve the representation of research results in this region the spatial scale of this study was relatively large the e d curves of the wrc and its sub regions are valuable for the early warning of dfs triggered by heavy rainfall however the early warning rainfall of dfs at smaller scales such as watershed scales must combine regional geological and topographic conditions with detailed rainfall data in addition a physical mechanism based model may be required to further study the triggering conditions of regional df and improve the early warning information of local df owing to data limitations this study only evaluated the ability of satellite products to capture heavy rainfall induced dfs further studies are required to comprehensively evaluate the ability of satellite products to capture precipitation occurrence and amount using multiple indices based on observed data series at meteorological stations 4 2 accuracy and applicability of global satellite precipitation products at regional scales at present there are many studies evaluating global satellite precipitation products in china most studies have shown that the gpm satellite product performs the best in china zhang et al 2020a tang et al 2020 kumar et al 2021 wei et al 2021 however compared with the humid and semi humid regions of eastern china its performance in the arid region of northwestern china is inferior zhang et al 2020a tang et al 2020 wei et al 2021 for example tang et al 2020 evaluated ten satellite and reanalysis products and found that the gpm product outperformed other datasets in china zhang et al 2020a found that the gpm performs better in humid regions than in semi arid regions and performs relatively worse in complex mountainous i e the qinghai tibet plateau and arid regions this study evaluated the ability of four global satellite precipitation products to capture rtrig in the wrc and the results of this study are consistent with these evaluation results this study found that the gpm product had the highest ability to capture rtrig however although it had a strong ability to capture rtrig in humid and semi humid regions its performance was relatively poor in western arid regions i e the qtx region the gpm is suitable for a mechanistic analysis of df induced by strong rainfall but cannot be applied to early warning because its latency is approximately three months cmorph mswep and persiann which comprise near real time estimates are highly useful for early warnings in areas lacking ground observations this study found that satellite precipitation products outperformed the ground observations of national meteorological stations in capturing rtrig in the wrc which was consistent with the conclusions of brunetti et al 2021 for india in addition this study found that the four satellite products showed complementary advantages in spatial distribution that is the regions with the best performance for each satellite product were different for example although the gpm product exhibited the best overall performance in the wrc it performed relatively poorly in xinjiang and tibet whereas cmorph and persiann showed the best performances in xinjiang and tibet respectively the combined performances of the four products were evaluated hence optimal products should be used when employing satellite precipitation products at a local scale in addition more studies should be conducted on the fusion of multi source satellite precipitation products such as the use of machine learning methods zhang et al 2021 to further improve the accuracy of satellite based measurements at a regional scale 4 3 comparison of early warning rainfall and e d curves between the wrc other regions and the world table 2 shows the e d curves and early warning rainfall within 48 h in the wrc and other regions overall the e d curves and early warning rainfall of the wrc were different and consistent with the global curve and those of the other regions the e d curves and warning values of number 4 9 were mostly equal to or higher than that of the wrc at the low warning level table 2 the e d curves estimated from sichuan number 7 and taiwan number 9 were much higher than those of the wrc for a high warning level the other curves varied between the low and high warning e d curves of the wrc the low warning e d curve of the wrc was similar to the global curve determined by hong and adler 2008 with the 24 h warning values of the two being similar the early warning rainfall of the wrc was lower than the global value within 24 h whereas the early warning value of the wrc within 48 h was approximately 20 mm higher than that of the global value the global e d curve proposed by caine 1980 is consistent with the medium warning e d curve of the wrc in the first 24 h the difference between the two warning values was approximately 3 mm whereas at 48 h the wrc warning value was 20 mm higher than the global value the e d curves and early warning values of the other regions 10 20 in table 2 were generally lower than the curve of the wrc for the low warning level for example the early warning rainfall of the global e d curve calibrated by guzzetti 2008 were only 13 0 and 19 2 mm during 24 and 48 h respectively the mean values of early warning rainfall of these e d curves were 16 7 26 0 33 2 and 43 0 mm at 3 12 24 and 48 h respectively these studies have used landslide based df data which might be one of the main reasons for the lower early warning rainfall values landslide based dfs are predominantly affected by geological and geomorphological conditions and rainfall is only a secondary trigger variations in the calibration samples are also one of the reasons for these differences for example seven e d curves for sichuan estimated from other studies table 2 were calibrated using limited df events in different small watersheds which led to large differences in the calibrated e d curves a considerable difference was observed between the adjacent watersheds in addition the different methods for estimating the e d i d curves were also one of the reasons for these mismatches for example in addition to the most commonly used method proposed by guzzetti et al 2007 some studies used the frequentist method brunetti et al 2010 which first fits the exponential curve for all df events the exponential morphology parameter β is then fixed and the translation curve is used to determine the corresponding parameter α for different probability values all df events used for the estimation of the i d curves by brunetti et al 2010 conformed to the exponential relationship however the i d or e d scatter plots of all df events used in this study did not conform to an exponential relationship with the fitted r2 of the curve being lower than 0 15 in contrast the fitted r2 values of the curves estimated using the methodology of this study were generally higher than 0 80 5 conclusion in this study a df inventory was developed containing over 523 df events triggered by heavy rainfall during 2000 2021 in the wrc based on this dataset rtrig was evaluated using gauge and satellite based precipitation measurements in the wrc the early warning rtrig was investigated from the i d and e d curves of the wrc and its subregions the ability of satellite products to capture rtrig data is generally higher than that of gauge observations the poor performance of the gauge observations was mainly due to the long distances between the meteorological stations and the df sites the ability of different satellite products to capture r24hr exhibited significant spatial variation the gpm showed the best overall performance throughout the wrc with a pod of 98 9 for heavy rainfall however it had a relatively poor ability to capture rtrig in the western region of the wrc although the overall performance of cmorph was relatively poor it showed the best performance in capturing rtrig in xinjiang which is the most inland region of china the overall performance of persiann was similar to that of gpm in addition it was the only satellite product with a pod of 100 in the qinghai tibet plateau which is the highest plateau on earth with an average altitude of 4000 m overall the four satellite precipitation products showed complementary advantages in the spatial distribution of the wrc the regions with the best performance for each satellite product differed therefore the combined ability of all satellite products showed perfect performance in capturing rtrig with a pod of 100 in capturing heavy rainfall for the 523 heavy rainfall events that caused the dfs in the wrc the combined ability of the four satellite products showed that the r24hr or rc3hr of the 521 df exceeded 50 mm the rc day estimated from gpm was the highest among the four satellite products which exhibited an overall decreasing trend from the east 100 mm to the west 50 mm the spatial distribution of rc day showed high consistency between gpm and mswep with a spatial correlation coefficient of 0 91 the rc day of the cmorph showed the opposite spatial distribution compared with the other three products with a spatial correlation coefficient of approximately 0 50 the critical rainfall duration estimated from the satellite products was 3 days in the wrc particularly in western sichuan the aer of the first 6 10 and 14 days was critical to the df in the wrc the e d curves of the wrc at low and medium early warning levels were consistent with the global e d curves estimated in other studies the early warning rainfall for each duration was mostly consistent for each product the mean warning rainfall of the wrc in 3 h estimated from the four products was 16 5 20 9 and 37 mm at the low medium and high levels respectively the corresponding warning rainfall values at 24 h were 64 2 91 4 and 152 6 mm respectively the i d curve fitted in each subregion showed higher reliability than the wrc curve with a fitted r2 higher than 0 80 the intensity of short term 9h rainfall in each region was higher than that in the entire wrc at all warning levels the early warning rtrig in the cgg was the highest which was generally similar in the gins and sichuan provinces the authors recommend using optimal products when employing satellite precipitation products at the local scale in addition more studies should be conducted on the fusion of multi source satellite precipitation products to further improve the accuracy of satellite based measurements at the regional scale declaration of

1949,under warm climates the more complex and malleable relationship between water and heat and the changes in the water components at the land atmosphere interface pose greater challenges to understanding hydro meteorological processes however the emergence of the advanced microwave scanning radiometer amsr has facilitated the precise monitoring of these changes therefore this study investigated and analyzed the spatiotemporal transformation characteristics of drought wetness and its driving mechanisms in central asia from july 2002 to december 2018 based on the amsr surface wetness index aswi coupled with multiple water components three major conclusions were drawn from this investigation first the spatiotemporal differences in multiple water components in central asia caused substantial spatiotemporal differences in the extent of changes in drought wetness for example arid areas were mainly concentrated in the lower reaches of the amu darya and syr darya river basins where the dominant drought periods were 2007 and 2018 second the centroids of the largest drought patches were mainly located in the northeast northwest and southwest regions of central asia central asia experienced a continuous drought from 2002 to 2005 and then a gradual wetting from 2008 to 2017 third the drought wetness variation can be attributed to the variation of water vapor flux in the typical barometric layer as well as the variation of precipitation and temperature the aswi may play an essential role in drought monitoring and tracking prediction particularly for drought risk mitigation and aversion keywords dynamic evolution centroids central asia advanced microwave scanning radiometer data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction drought is a natural and recurring feature and a regional phenomenon of the climate system diaz et al 2020 world meteorological organization 2006 drought has traditionally been classified into four types namely meteorological agricultural hydrological and socioeconomic subsequently a fifth type of drought has been proposed namely ecological wilhite glantz 1985 ecological droughts are generally considered a precipitation and temperature anomaly that results in a lack of soil moisture sm runoff and groundwater when extending over a region van loon 2015 they impact almost all territorial extensions worldwide with immeasurable losses and consequences on water resources and the social economy tallaksen et al 2009 the world meteorological organization has stated that better drought mitigation can be achieved by developing and implementing national policies that are based on the best description of drought world meteorological organization 2006 in drought detection drought indexes are usually applied to identify water shortages yang et al 2020a these convert hydro meteorological variables into values related to the water anomaly wanders et al 2010 in the 21st century droughts which cover a wide spatial range and are typically characterized by higher temperatures had longer duration and increasing intensity owing to the increasing demand for water resources otkin et al 2017 for example extreme drought events in the united states over the past decade have caused significant social damage widespread destruction of natural ecosystems reduced surface and groundwater supplies and sharp declines in agricultural production otkin et al 2017 therefore the study of the spatiotemporal characteristics and dynamics of drought is important for the accurate identification of losses caused by drought and drought risk avoidance the rich collection of observation data remote sensing data and proposed drought indexes e g standard precipitation index spi and standard precipitation evapotranspiration index spei not only provide important methods and means to study the spatial and temporal distribution of drought but also improve the monitoring and prediction of drought van loon 2015 the duration intensity amplitude and spatial extent area of drought are considered very useful in understanding the spatial and temporal characteristics of drought particularly in terms of the largest drought area lda among drought patches diaz et al 2018 herrera estrada et al 2017 vernieuwe et al 2019 they all provide a new and critical direction for research on drought events hao et al 2017 there are knowledge gaps associated with the assessment of the temporal variation of drought and compensates for the fact that the spatial distribution of drought at a specific point although drought indexes may provide useful information for spatial research on drought they lack information on drought dynamics and are unable to provide insights into the spatial path of droughts diaz et al 2019 hao et al 2017 furthermore although previous studies on the spatiotemporal characteristics of drought included drought tracking they lack information on the transformation among multiple drought categories and insights into the driving factors of drought occurrence e g diaz et al 2018 diaz et al 2019 herrera estrada et al 2017 zhou et al 2019 therefore the study of drought centroid shift and different drought category transitions is of great importance to reveal the spatial and temporal characteristics and driving factors of drought events quantitative assessment of major water cycle components and their climate average is essential for the detection of droughts and the clarification of related drivers and consequences du et al 2019 however as droughts occur on multiple time scales and their impacts vary across different socioeconomic sectors landscapes and hydrological cycle components it is difficult to develop a unified definition of drought that applies to all scenarios without complicated mathematical and physical calculations e g copula du et al 2019 yang et al 2019 fortunately drought indicators from remote sensing including satellite precipitation and sm observations have improved the capability of low cost and large scale drought assessment compared with that of field measurements and hydrological model simulations of variables within the hydrological cycle aghakouchak et al 2015 dai et al 2004 wood et al 2015 many remote sensing products e g moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer mu et al 2013 amsr du et al 2017 du et al 2019 and gravity recovery and climate experiment grace yang et al 2020a have been widely applied to monitor global or regional drought events asia gu et al 2019 yao et al 2020 europe chiogna et al 2018 australia kiem et al 2016 america tortajada et al 2017 and africa schlenker lobell 2010 over the past 20 years advances in microwave remote sensing of global sm have greatly improved the ability of satellites to monitor agricultural drought by reducing the impact of weather and cloud cover on remote sensing monitoring du et al 2019 drought assessment and crop growth monitoring can benefit from the measurement of multiple water components including vapor pressure deficit vpd sm at the ground surface and open water fraction owf du et al 2017 du et al 2019 however these data may be acquired from the advanced microwave scanning radiometer for the earth observing system amsr e and other satellite products such as soil moisture and ocean salinity and soil moisture active passive martínez fernández et al 2016 sadri et al 2018 yin et al 2018 in particular du et al 2017 du et al 2019 demonstrated a correlation relationship between the amsr surface wetness index aswi and palmer drought severity index pdsi in the drought research field and its more extensive applicability with a high spatial resolution of approximately 25 km 25 km worldwide therefore the aswi can be applied to portray drought dynamic characteristics and the transformation of different drought classifications at a high spatial resolution over an extensive area central asia is located at the core of the eurasian continent and features a temperate continental climate this climate is characterized by a dry summer and a wet winter lioubimtseva et al 2005 mannig et al 2013 as precipitation in the central and western regions of central asia is lower than that in the southeast serious droughts often occur in turkmenistan uzbekistan and central southern kazakhstan klein et al 2012 ta et al 2018 although the annual precipitation in central asia has increased in the past half century the drought risk in central asia derived from the spei has been increasing since 1950 owing to high evapotranspiration and global warming xu et al 2015 meanwhile although much work has been conducted in previous studies on drought events in central asia e g guo et al 2018 yang et al 2017 there is a lack of research on the shift in the centroids of drought in central asia and the transition between different drought categories as such there is a need to better understand the spatiotemporal characteristics of drought in central asia chen et al 2018 therefore the main objectives of this study were to 1 construct a drought index to reflect various water components in central asia in recent decades based on amsr remote sensing products 2 explore the dynamic spatiotemporal characteristics of drought events and 3 gain insights into the possible causes of drought 2 study region central asia is located at the junction between asia and europe and is an important land passage chen et al 2018 this region is vast bordering russia in the north afghanistan in the south the caspian sea in the west and the tianshan mountains and pamir plateau in the east the study region includes the five countries i e kyrgyzstan kazakhstan tajikistan turkmenistan and uzbekistan located in traditional central asia and afghanistan these regions span a total area exceeding 4 106 km2 chen et al 2018 the elevation in central asia increases gradually from west to east from the caspian sea to the eastern tianshan mountains fig 1 chen et al 2018 the headwaters of the major rivers in central asia including the amu darya syr darya and irtysh rivers originate from the tianshan mountains the major lakes in this region include the aral sea the caspian sea and balkhash lake these aquatic ecosystems are important water resources that sustain the ecology and agricultural development in central asia wang et al 2020 zou et al 2020 central asia is located far from the ocean thus the region has a lower atmospheric water vapor content this means that the climate gradually changes from semi arid to arid from north to south featuring infrequent precipitation drought and generally high temperature differences zou et al 2020 in summer the average temperature is between 20 c and 30 c whereas the average temperature is 0 c in winter extreme temperatures in the north and the mountainous areas are typically lower than 20 c in winter gessner et al 2013 the annual average precipitation gradually increases from 100 mm to 400 mm from the low altitude plains to the high altitude mountains bai et al 2019 gessner et al 2013 although most precipitation occurs in winter and spring except for in the west and east of kazakhstan precipitation in central asia is relatively uniform across all seasons chen et al 2011 the land use types in central asia are predominantly grassland and desert which are mainly located in kyrgyzstan and kazakhstan and in turkmenistan and uzbekistan respectively chen et al 2018 snow and ice cover the mountains of kyrgyzstan and tajikistan and the low altitude areas of uzbekistan and kazakhstan mueller et al 2014 the cultivated land in central asia is primarily located in the alluvial plain whereas irrigated and rain fed agriculture is distributed in the southern and northern regions of central asia respectively kariyeva and leeuwen 2012 3 materials and methods 3 1 materials 3 1 1 amsr lpdr data the amsr land parameter data record lpdr originates from the amsr this data can inversely determine the characteristics of the interface between land and atmosphere based on radiative transfer theory du et al 2017 the consistency and uncertainty of amsr e and amsr 2 have been demonstrated and effectively reduced du et al 2019 daily descending amsr lpdr with a 25 km spatial resolution was downloaded from the website of the numerical terradynamic simulation group https www ntsg umt edu project amsr php in this study the vpd kpa owf 0 1 and ground surface i e top 0 5 cm sm cm3 cm3 derived from the amsr lpdr were used to investigate the moisture of the land atmosphere system any missing data were determined using linear interpolation 3 1 2 ncep reanalysis data to identify the driving factors datasets on monthly precipitation temperature absolute humidity and wind with a spatial distribution of 2 5 2 5 were obtained from the national centers for environmental prediction ncep reanalysis 2 https psl noaa gov data gridded data ncep reanalysis2 html these datasets were applied to evaluate the effects of water heat water vapor flux and wind direction on the changes in dry and wet periods reanalysis 2 data processing addressed the errors from reanalysis 1 and physical processes using updated parameters 3 2 methods 3 2 1 aswi the aswi is a coupled drought index based on the z scores of vpd owf and sm which may be considered the standardized anomalies of monthly vpd sm and owf from corrected lpdr data respectively it is a satellite based index which is independent from and complementary to the traditional drought indices such as pdsi and spei for semi arid regions the index likely works better than the traditional indices in terms of correlation with vegetation health du et al 2021 the coefficient of variation cv for vpd owf and sm was used to calculate the aswi this can effectively illustrate the humidity of the land atmosphere interface with less uncertainty using satellites smaller cvs indicate that amsr data are less effective in drought monitoring and limit the quality of amsr data to reflect the on ground state du et al 2017 because central asia features an arid climate owf values exceeding 0 2 were eliminated according to du et al 2019 the aswi is calculated using eq 1 as follows 1 z i v i v i σ i where v denotes the three water components and σ z and i are the time standard deviation z score of water components and number of water components respectively the weight of the water components may be derived as follows eq 2 2 w i cv i i 1 3 cv i where cv and w represent the cv and the weight of the water components from amsr lrdp respectively finally the aswi is calculated as follows eq 3 3 a s w i i 1 3 w i z i a drought event typically has an aswi of less than 0 249 for a specific month 3 2 2 definition of drought track we defined continuous grid points along eight directions of the centroid as a drought patch fig 2 to better describe the drought track and transformation the centroid of the largest drought patch was introduced to describe the drought characteristics and to avoid the use of the wrong definition of a drought patch with fewer grids we also defined drought duration as the period from the beginning to the end of the drought event drought severity was the sum of the drought indexes throughout the drought the specific expressions are as follows 4 drought d u r a t i o n t end t start 1 5 d r o u g h t i n t e n s i t y aswi 0 249 where t end t start and aswi 0 249 denote the end of the drought event the start of the drought event and an aswi of less than 0 249 respectively in addition the categroies of drought from aswi can be seen the table 1 3 2 3 moran s i moran s i is a measure of spatial autocorrelation characterized by a correlation among contiguous locations that are multi dimensional and multi directional in terms of spatial distribution jin et al 2020 yu et al 2020 it can be defined using the following equation eq 6 6 i n i j w ij i j w ij x i x x j x i x i x 2 where n is the number of spatial units indexed by i and j x is the variable of interest x is the mean of x and w ij is an element of a matrix of spatial weights the expected value of moran s i under the null hypothesis of zero spatial autocorrelation is as follows eq 7 7 e i 1 n 1 3 2 4 markov matrix the markov model is a useful method used to predict the state and trend of a future event using the initial probability of different states and the transitional relationship among states huang et al 2020 it has often been used to predict changing trends of land use aksoy kaptan 2020 and food energy water flow qin et al 2022 as follows eq 8 8 s t 1 p 11 p 1 n p n 1 p nn s t where s t 1 and s t are the land use statuses of t 1 and t respectively pij is the transfer probability of the i type of land use converting into the j type of land use n is the number of land use types and 0 pij 1 i 1 n p ij 1 the transfer matrix of land use can reflect its structural characteristics the transformation scenario and the direction among different land use types and can provide insights into each type of transfer in and out as follows eq 9 9 s ij s 11 s 1 n s n 1 s nn i j 1 2 3 n where s ij is the area from type i to type j and i and j are land use types prior to and after the transfer respectively in this study the transfer matrix was used to describe the transition between different drought categories in central asia 3 2 5 wavelet analysis in this study two types of wavelet analysis were related to drought driving factors namely cross wavelet analysis and multifactor wavelet analysis cross wavelet analysis was used to analyze the relationship between changes in independent and dependent variables whereas multiple wavelet coherence mwc was used to analyze the correlation between multiple independent variables and a single dependent variable both have a wide range of applications in the field of hydrological causal analysis e g grinsted et al 2004 hu si 2016 for the mwc the 95 significance level was calculated based on the monte carlo method grinsted et al 2004 hu and si 2016 4 results 4 1 changes in terrestrial water components and related drought indexes in central asia fig 3 depicts the spatiotemporal distribution of multiple water components and their coupled dry wet index i e aswi at the land atmosphere interface in central asia in terms of spatial distribution the vpd in the western part of central asia which had a maximum value of 2 5 kpa month was greater than that in the eastern region fig 3a the monthly average vpd in the tianshan mountains was much lower than that in other regions in terms of temporal distribution although central asia is located deep in the eurasian hinterland there were clear seasonal fluctuations in the vpd time series in addition the vpd in the summer half of the year was significantly greater than that in the winter half of the year fig 3b the monthly average spatial distribution of sm at the ground surface was opposite to that of vpd thereby indicating that the sm at the ground surface of the tianshan mountains was significantly higher than that in the low altitude areas fig 3c because central asia is strongly impacted by its arid climate the scarcity and indistinct characteristics of owf were well reflected in the amsr wherein only higher values appeared along the rivers and lakes fig 3e the larger standard deviation among grids also highlighted the difference in surface water in central asia fig 3f however the spatial distribution of the drought index i e aswi was different from that of the above three water components in central asia based on the united states drought monitor usdm classification drought had largely occurred in the lower reaches of the amu darya and syr darya river basins whereas the western part of the tianshan mountains and western northern central asia were relatively humid fig 3g the temporal distribution of the aswi was highly uneven with significant and irregular fluctuations the significant drought occurred in 2007 which was followed by a wetting phenomenon fig 3h 4 2 spatiotemporal distribution of drought in central asia fig 4 illustrates the relationship between the total drought area tda lda and the number of drought patches for different months in central asia in terms of temporal distribution the maximum tda and lda in central asia were concentrated in 2007 respectively this implies that a serious drought occurred in central asia during this period fig 4a the tda was significant and negatively correlated with the drought patches p 0 001 r 2 0 7 whereas the correlation was clear with a larger tda and lda table 2 fig 4d for example in the first 10 of the tda the coefficient of determination between the tda and the lda was 0 25 p 0 05 whereas in the last 20 of the tda the coefficient of determination was 0 99 p 0 001 in contrast there were low levels of drought patches in 2007 and 2008 thereby implying that the drought grids were closely connected as the tda and lda decreased the drought patches increased fig 4c and f this result was consistent with the findings of previous studies aitekeyeva et al 2020 yang et al 2020a and has been demonstrated in the emergency events database guha sapir 2018 table 2 based on the usdm classification scheme the aswi was categorized into different drought categories fig 5 illustrates the frequency of different drought categories in central asia these results demonstrated that central asia experienced the highest frequency of abnormal droughts followed by moderate droughts and severe droughts whereas extreme droughts rarely occurred the frequency of abnormal drought was low in the tianshan mountains and high in low altitude areas the highest frequency was approximately 40 60 fig 5a however there was a gradually narrowing difference between drought frequency at low altitudes and high altitudes for the moderate drought category fig 5b the frequency of severe and extreme droughts at high altitudes was significantly higher than that at low altitudes fig 5c and d moran s i was applied to analyze the spatial autocorrelation of drought frequency for the different drought categories table 3 the results revealed that there was significant global spatial autocorrelation in the four drought categories in central asia spatial autocorrelation gradually weakened from abnormal moderate and severe to extreme droughts fig 6 presents the spatial distribution of drought duration and severity in central asia the maximum drought duration was observed in the lower reaches of the amu darya and syr darya river basins extending over 100 months whereas droughts in the tianshan mountains were relatively short lasting only a few months fig 6a in addition the spatial distribution of drought severity reflected similar patterns of drought duration whereby severity was relatively low in the tianshan mountains and high in areas of low altitude fig 6b there was a clear correlation between drought duration and drought severity the correlation coefficient was 0 76 p 0 05 fig 6d according to the drought severity to drought duration ratio there were no clear patterns in monthly average drought severity for low altitude areas whereas these patterns were more distinct in the tianshan mountains fig 6c fig 7 shows the centroid of the largest monthly drought patch in central asia the centroid of central asia was arbitrarily allocated as the origin and the horizontal and vertical lines passing through the origin were considered the coordinate axes the centroids of the lda in central asia were frequent in the first second and third quadrant and less frequent in the fourth quadrant this meant that the centroids of drought mainly appeared in the northeast northwest and southwest of central asia fig 7a the greater the proximity to the centroid of central asia the larger the drought area in contrast the greater the distance from the centroid the greater the occurrence of drought patches fig 7b d these findings are consistent with those in fig 4 fig 8 shows the spatial distribution of the centroid for annual drought in central asia which was derived from the annual average value of monthly aswi it was found that the annual drought centroid was mainly distributed in the second quadrant similarly the greater the proximity to the centroid the larger the drought area and the higher the lda 4 3 characteristics of spatial transformation for different drought categories the markov matrix was used to analyze changes in the drought grid in different periods 2003 2008 2008 2013 2013 2018 and 2003 2018 to understand the transformation between different drought categories in central asia fig 9 presents a chord diagram which represents the results of the markov matrix analysis for the spatial transformation of different drought categories in central asia for drought conversion characteristics during 2003 2008 approximately one third of nd grids had changed to ad although few ad grids had changed to md there were not many drought grids for other categories as such their characteristics were not prominent thus drought was the major phenomenon in central asia during 2003 2008 fig 9a in terms of drought characteristics from 2008 to 2013 approximately one sixth of nd grids had changed to ad whereas five sixths of ad grids had changed to nd and four fifths of md grids had changed to nd generally central asia showed a clear wetting trend for 2008 2013 fig 9b during 2013 2018 only a small part of the nd grids had changed to md whereas half of the ad grids had changed to nd and almost all the md grids had changed to nd in summary 2013 2018 exhibited a clear wetting trend in central asia fig 9c for the entire 2003 2018 period only a small part of the nd grids had changed to ad whereas almost half of the ad md and sd grids had changed to nd grids thus central asia experienced a clear wetting phenomenon in 2003 2018 which was characterized by successive episodes of drought and wetness 4 4 possible driving factors of drought in central asia the water vapor flux and wind direction at a typical atmospheric height 850 hpa were used to analyze mechanisms that drive the incidence of drought in central asia fig 10 shows the spatial distribution of atmospheric water vapor flux and wind direction during typical dry and wet periods as illustrated in fig 3a droughts occurred in april 2006 and wetness events occurred in april 2008 october 2014 and august 2016 it was found that atmospheric absolute humidity was relatively high in central asia during april 2006 whereas the water vapor flux in this location was low fig 10a in april 2008 atmospheric absolute humidity in central asia was relatively high the water vapor mainly originated from the arctic ocean and was weakly influenced by westerly winds fig 10b in october 2014 atmospheric absolute humidity in central asia was relatively high northern central asia was affected by cold water vapor from the arctic ocean whereas southern central asia was affected by the warm and wet water vapor from several indian ocean monsoons fig 10c however the absolute humidity in central asia was relatively small whereas water vapor flux was greatly influenced by arctic ocean circulation in august 2016 fig 10d in addition we also explored the influence of precipitation and temperature on the aswi among the direct major factors in central asia based on wavelet analysis fig 11 according to the cross wavelet analysis at the 8 16 month scale the effect of precipitation on the aswi showed a significant positive correlation i e the greater the precipitation the higher the aswi whereas the effect of temperature on the aswi mainly showed a significant negative correlation i e the higher the temperature the lower the aswi fig 11a 11d multiple wavelet analysis showed that both precipitation and temperature had significant effects on the aswi at the 8 16 month scale fig 11e therefore except for the influencing factors of atmospheric circulation both precipitation and air temperature were critical in the variation of the aswi in central asia this work reveals that drought dynamics in typical arid zones determined via geometric concepts i e drought centroid monitoring and conversion among different drought categories can be profoundly influenced by ice meltwater as well as precipitation and temperature 5 discussion the evaluation of drought events using remote sensing data compensates for the problems faced during real time monitoring of droughts in areas equipped with few monitoring stations or with missing data this method has great significance because it offers the ability to evaluate heavy losses caused by large scale drought disasters and avoid or minimize drought risk aghakouchak nakhjiri 2012 yin et al 2018 to quantify the uncertainty associated with the aswi du et al 2019 constructed and compared several traditional indexes grace drought severity index spi and pdsi with the aswi the results demonstrated that amsr lpdr may be used to monitor global changes in multiple water components and drought du et al 2019 however daily sm owf and vpd were disturbed by random noise thereby resulting in the reduced accuracy of amsr du et al 2017 for the sake of simplicity the thresholds i e vpd 0 48 kpa owf 0 057 sm 0 042 cm3 cm3 of sm ofw and vpd were defined based on amsr e data to maintain higher consistency with amsr 2 data du et al 2017 du et al 2018 the differences and similarities between the reference aswi and observed aswi were assessed du et al 2017 the mean absolute error was also quantified based on monthly aswi records and reference values to characterize the uncertainty du et al 2019 therefore the aswi can be applied to drought related studies amsr performs well in moderate and low vegetation coverage areas du et al 2017 du et al 2019 which is why the aswi is closely related to traditional drought indexes in the farmlands and grasslands of northern central asia this also proves why the drought events in central asia are mainly concentrated in the amu darya and syr darya basins this research also reveals that although central asia tended to be humid throughout the study period droughts continued to occur in the early stage e g 2004 2006 and 2008 and ceased as the region gradually became wet in the latter half of the period i e 2010 2018 furthermore the spatiotemporal characteristics of droughts in central asia presented in this study are consistent with the results of previous studies i e aitekeyeva et al 2020 chen et al 2018 yang et al 2020b and the drought events in central asia recorded in the emergency database table 3 guha sapir 2018 at high altitudes the hydrological environment of southern central asia and the tianshan mountains is dominated by glaciers seasonal snow cover alpine lakes and rivers these features are strongly impacted by precipitation and temperature and are decoupled with the local climate wang et al 2020 yang et al 2020a yang et al 2020b yu et al 2020 therefore changes in drought conditions in these regions are complex this may be the reason for the rare appearances of centroids of the largest drought patches in the second quadrant i e tianshan mountains or southern central asia which is consistent with the findings of klein et al 2012 and ta et al 2018 owing to the vast territory of central asia which is affected by multiple hydro meteorological factors in different regions the water vapor flux is extremely complex chen et al 2018 although the absolute humidity of the atmosphere in april 2006 was high there was little water vapor from the ocean owing to weak wind forces this inevitably resulted in droughts in april 2008 although cold water vapor had been transported from the arctic ocean to central asia the warm and humid atmospheric flow was rich thereby causing the monopolistic atmospheric mass to engulf central asia in october 2014 central asia was affected by cold and humid atmospheric flow from the north of the arctic ocean and the warm and humid atmospheric flow of the westerly belt this double vapor flux converged in the west of central asia thereby resulting in a humid environment fig 9c the abundant water vapor flux appeared north of 30 n in october 2016 whereas there was a large water vapor flux from the southwest thereby increasing the vapor flux in central asia fig 9d central asia was also impacted by specific teleconnection indexes e g north atlantic oscillation and el niño southern oscillation yu et al 2020 furthermore both precipitation and temperature had a significant effect on the dryness and wetness of central asia at an 8 16 month scale amsr uncertainty resulted in the inconsistency of hydrological factors in different regions of central asia du et al 2019 it is crucial to reduce the uncertainty of hydrological inversion of amsr for its application in hydrology and water resources the characteristics of the spatiotemporal transition of drought were closely related to the typical atmospheric water vapor flux 850 hpa thereby indicating that the changes in drought conditions in central asia were impacted by water vapor change particularly in the western and northern regions of central asia 6 conclusion the emergence of amsr has provided favorable data and technical support to monitor changes in various water components at the land atmosphere interface in this study multiple water components were coupled to an index to describe droughts using amsr remote sensing data the characteristics of the spatiotemporal transformation of drought wetness and the driving mechanisms of drought in central asia from july 2002 to december 2018 were investigated and analyzed based on the aswi the conclusions of this study are as follows 1 there were great spatial and temporal differences in various water components in central asia the dry and wet conditions in central asia also had clear spatial and temporal differences furthermore the most serious drought occurred in the lower reaches of the amu darya and syr darya river basins whereas the aswi time series exhibited irregular changes with a significant dry period succeeded by a wet period 2 the centroids of the largest drought patches with areas consistent with the tdas in central asia were mainly located in the first second and third quadrants and rarely located in the fourth quadrant this corresponded to the northeast northwest and southwest regions of central asia although there was continuous spatial transformation among different drought levels with significant global spatial autocorrelation the key event was the continuous drought from 2003 to 2008 in central asia which was followed by a gradual wetting period from 2008 to 2018 3 central asia is vast and impacted by many climatic factors the driving factors of drought change are complex and variable for typical drought records in recent years the variations in water vapor flux and absolute humidity in the typical barometric layer were attributed to the incidence of drought in 2006 and 2008 and the wetness in 2014 and 2016 however the application of the aswi is dependent on the revision of amsr parameters and reducing uncertainty declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the

1949,under warm climates the more complex and malleable relationship between water and heat and the changes in the water components at the land atmosphere interface pose greater challenges to understanding hydro meteorological processes however the emergence of the advanced microwave scanning radiometer amsr has facilitated the precise monitoring of these changes therefore this study investigated and analyzed the spatiotemporal transformation characteristics of drought wetness and its driving mechanisms in central asia from july 2002 to december 2018 based on the amsr surface wetness index aswi coupled with multiple water components three major conclusions were drawn from this investigation first the spatiotemporal differences in multiple water components in central asia caused substantial spatiotemporal differences in the extent of changes in drought wetness for example arid areas were mainly concentrated in the lower reaches of the amu darya and syr darya river basins where the dominant drought periods were 2007 and 2018 second the centroids of the largest drought patches were mainly located in the northeast northwest and southwest regions of central asia central asia experienced a continuous drought from 2002 to 2005 and then a gradual wetting from 2008 to 2017 third the drought wetness variation can be attributed to the variation of water vapor flux in the typical barometric layer as well as the variation of precipitation and temperature the aswi may play an essential role in drought monitoring and tracking prediction particularly for drought risk mitigation and aversion keywords dynamic evolution centroids central asia advanced microwave scanning radiometer data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction drought is a natural and recurring feature and a regional phenomenon of the climate system diaz et al 2020 world meteorological organization 2006 drought has traditionally been classified into four types namely meteorological agricultural hydrological and socioeconomic subsequently a fifth type of drought has been proposed namely ecological wilhite glantz 1985 ecological droughts are generally considered a precipitation and temperature anomaly that results in a lack of soil moisture sm runoff and groundwater when extending over a region van loon 2015 they impact almost all territorial extensions worldwide with immeasurable losses and consequences on water resources and the social economy tallaksen et al 2009 the world meteorological organization has stated that better drought mitigation can be achieved by developing and implementing national policies that are based on the best description of drought world meteorological organization 2006 in drought detection drought indexes are usually applied to identify water shortages yang et al 2020a these convert hydro meteorological variables into values related to the water anomaly wanders et al 2010 in the 21st century droughts which cover a wide spatial range and are typically characterized by higher temperatures had longer duration and increasing intensity owing to the increasing demand for water resources otkin et al 2017 for example extreme drought events in the united states over the past decade have caused significant social damage widespread destruction of natural ecosystems reduced surface and groundwater supplies and sharp declines in agricultural production otkin et al 2017 therefore the study of the spatiotemporal characteristics and dynamics of drought is important for the accurate identification of losses caused by drought and drought risk avoidance the rich collection of observation data remote sensing data and proposed drought indexes e g standard precipitation index spi and standard precipitation evapotranspiration index spei not only provide important methods and means to study the spatial and temporal distribution of drought but also improve the monitoring and prediction of drought van loon 2015 the duration intensity amplitude and spatial extent area of drought are considered very useful in understanding the spatial and temporal characteristics of drought particularly in terms of the largest drought area lda among drought patches diaz et al 2018 herrera estrada et al 2017 vernieuwe et al 2019 they all provide a new and critical direction for research on drought events hao et al 2017 there are knowledge gaps associated with the assessment of the temporal variation of drought and compensates for the fact that the spatial distribution of drought at a specific point although drought indexes may provide useful information for spatial research on drought they lack information on drought dynamics and are unable to provide insights into the spatial path of droughts diaz et al 2019 hao et al 2017 furthermore although previous studies on the spatiotemporal characteristics of drought included drought tracking they lack information on the transformation among multiple drought categories and insights into the driving factors of drought occurrence e g diaz et al 2018 diaz et al 2019 herrera estrada et al 2017 zhou et al 2019 therefore the study of drought centroid shift and different drought category transitions is of great importance to reveal the spatial and temporal characteristics and driving factors of drought events quantitative assessment of major water cycle components and their climate average is essential for the detection of droughts and the clarification of related drivers and consequences du et al 2019 however as droughts occur on multiple time scales and their impacts vary across different socioeconomic sectors landscapes and hydrological cycle components it is difficult to develop a unified definition of drought that applies to all scenarios without complicated mathematical and physical calculations e g copula du et al 2019 yang et al 2019 fortunately drought indicators from remote sensing including satellite precipitation and sm observations have improved the capability of low cost and large scale drought assessment compared with that of field measurements and hydrological model simulations of variables within the hydrological cycle aghakouchak et al 2015 dai et al 2004 wood et al 2015 many remote sensing products e g moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer mu et al 2013 amsr du et al 2017 du et al 2019 and gravity recovery and climate experiment grace yang et al 2020a have been widely applied to monitor global or regional drought events asia gu et al 2019 yao et al 2020 europe chiogna et al 2018 australia kiem et al 2016 america tortajada et al 2017 and africa schlenker lobell 2010 over the past 20 years advances in microwave remote sensing of global sm have greatly improved the ability of satellites to monitor agricultural drought by reducing the impact of weather and cloud cover on remote sensing monitoring du et al 2019 drought assessment and crop growth monitoring can benefit from the measurement of multiple water components including vapor pressure deficit vpd sm at the ground surface and open water fraction owf du et al 2017 du et al 2019 however these data may be acquired from the advanced microwave scanning radiometer for the earth observing system amsr e and other satellite products such as soil moisture and ocean salinity and soil moisture active passive martínez fernández et al 2016 sadri et al 2018 yin et al 2018 in particular du et al 2017 du et al 2019 demonstrated a correlation relationship between the amsr surface wetness index aswi and palmer drought severity index pdsi in the drought research field and its more extensive applicability with a high spatial resolution of approximately 25 km 25 km worldwide therefore the aswi can be applied to portray drought dynamic characteristics and the transformation of different drought classifications at a high spatial resolution over an extensive area central asia is located at the core of the eurasian continent and features a temperate continental climate this climate is characterized by a dry summer and a wet winter lioubimtseva et al 2005 mannig et al 2013 as precipitation in the central and western regions of central asia is lower than that in the southeast serious droughts often occur in turkmenistan uzbekistan and central southern kazakhstan klein et al 2012 ta et al 2018 although the annual precipitation in central asia has increased in the past half century the drought risk in central asia derived from the spei has been increasing since 1950 owing to high evapotranspiration and global warming xu et al 2015 meanwhile although much work has been conducted in previous studies on drought events in central asia e g guo et al 2018 yang et al 2017 there is a lack of research on the shift in the centroids of drought in central asia and the transition between different drought categories as such there is a need to better understand the spatiotemporal characteristics of drought in central asia chen et al 2018 therefore the main objectives of this study were to 1 construct a drought index to reflect various water components in central asia in recent decades based on amsr remote sensing products 2 explore the dynamic spatiotemporal characteristics of drought events and 3 gain insights into the possible causes of drought 2 study region central asia is located at the junction between asia and europe and is an important land passage chen et al 2018 this region is vast bordering russia in the north afghanistan in the south the caspian sea in the west and the tianshan mountains and pamir plateau in the east the study region includes the five countries i e kyrgyzstan kazakhstan tajikistan turkmenistan and uzbekistan located in traditional central asia and afghanistan these regions span a total area exceeding 4 106 km2 chen et al 2018 the elevation in central asia increases gradually from west to east from the caspian sea to the eastern tianshan mountains fig 1 chen et al 2018 the headwaters of the major rivers in central asia including the amu darya syr darya and irtysh rivers originate from the tianshan mountains the major lakes in this region include the aral sea the caspian sea and balkhash lake these aquatic ecosystems are important water resources that sustain the ecology and agricultural development in central asia wang et al 2020 zou et al 2020 central asia is located far from the ocean thus the region has a lower atmospheric water vapor content this means that the climate gradually changes from semi arid to arid from north to south featuring infrequent precipitation drought and generally high temperature differences zou et al 2020 in summer the average temperature is between 20 c and 30 c whereas the average temperature is 0 c in winter extreme temperatures in the north and the mountainous areas are typically lower than 20 c in winter gessner et al 2013 the annual average precipitation gradually increases from 100 mm to 400 mm from the low altitude plains to the high altitude mountains bai et al 2019 gessner et al 2013 although most precipitation occurs in winter and spring except for in the west and east of kazakhstan precipitation in central asia is relatively uniform across all seasons chen et al 2011 the land use types in central asia are predominantly grassland and desert which are mainly located in kyrgyzstan and kazakhstan and in turkmenistan and uzbekistan respectively chen et al 2018 snow and ice cover the mountains of kyrgyzstan and tajikistan and the low altitude areas of uzbekistan and kazakhstan mueller et al 2014 the cultivated land in central asia is primarily located in the alluvial plain whereas irrigated and rain fed agriculture is distributed in the southern and northern regions of central asia respectively kariyeva and leeuwen 2012 3 materials and methods 3 1 materials 3 1 1 amsr lpdr data the amsr land parameter data record lpdr originates from the amsr this data can inversely determine the characteristics of the interface between land and atmosphere based on radiative transfer theory du et al 2017 the consistency and uncertainty of amsr e and amsr 2 have been demonstrated and effectively reduced du et al 2019 daily descending amsr lpdr with a 25 km spatial resolution was downloaded from the website of the numerical terradynamic simulation group https www ntsg umt edu project amsr php in this study the vpd kpa owf 0 1 and ground surface i e top 0 5 cm sm cm3 cm3 derived from the amsr lpdr were used to investigate the moisture of the land atmosphere system any missing data were determined using linear interpolation 3 1 2 ncep reanalysis data to identify the driving factors datasets on monthly precipitation temperature absolute humidity and wind with a spatial distribution of 2 5 2 5 were obtained from the national centers for environmental prediction ncep reanalysis 2 https psl noaa gov data gridded data ncep reanalysis2 html these datasets were applied to evaluate the effects of water heat water vapor flux and wind direction on the changes in dry and wet periods reanalysis 2 data processing addressed the errors from reanalysis 1 and physical processes using updated parameters 3 2 methods 3 2 1 aswi the aswi is a coupled drought index based on the z scores of vpd owf and sm which may be considered the standardized anomalies of monthly vpd sm and owf from corrected lpdr data respectively it is a satellite based index which is independent from and complementary to the traditional drought indices such as pdsi and spei for semi arid regions the index likely works better than the traditional indices in terms of correlation with vegetation health du et al 2021 the coefficient of variation cv for vpd owf and sm was used to calculate the aswi this can effectively illustrate the humidity of the land atmosphere interface with less uncertainty using satellites smaller cvs indicate that amsr data are less effective in drought monitoring and limit the quality of amsr data to reflect the on ground state du et al 2017 because central asia features an arid climate owf values exceeding 0 2 were eliminated according to du et al 2019 the aswi is calculated using eq 1 as follows 1 z i v i v i σ i where v denotes the three water components and σ z and i are the time standard deviation z score of water components and number of water components respectively the weight of the water components may be derived as follows eq 2 2 w i cv i i 1 3 cv i where cv and w represent the cv and the weight of the water components from amsr lrdp respectively finally the aswi is calculated as follows eq 3 3 a s w i i 1 3 w i z i a drought event typically has an aswi of less than 0 249 for a specific month 3 2 2 definition of drought track we defined continuous grid points along eight directions of the centroid as a drought patch fig 2 to better describe the drought track and transformation the centroid of the largest drought patch was introduced to describe the drought characteristics and to avoid the use of the wrong definition of a drought patch with fewer grids we also defined drought duration as the period from the beginning to the end of the drought event drought severity was the sum of the drought indexes throughout the drought the specific expressions are as follows 4 drought d u r a t i o n t end t start 1 5 d r o u g h t i n t e n s i t y aswi 0 249 where t end t start and aswi 0 249 denote the end of the drought event the start of the drought event and an aswi of less than 0 249 respectively in addition the categroies of drought from aswi can be seen the table 1 3 2 3 moran s i moran s i is a measure of spatial autocorrelation characterized by a correlation among contiguous locations that are multi dimensional and multi directional in terms of spatial distribution jin et al 2020 yu et al 2020 it can be defined using the following equation eq 6 6 i n i j w ij i j w ij x i x x j x i x i x 2 where n is the number of spatial units indexed by i and j x is the variable of interest x is the mean of x and w ij is an element of a matrix of spatial weights the expected value of moran s i under the null hypothesis of zero spatial autocorrelation is as follows eq 7 7 e i 1 n 1 3 2 4 markov matrix the markov model is a useful method used to predict the state and trend of a future event using the initial probability of different states and the transitional relationship among states huang et al 2020 it has often been used to predict changing trends of land use aksoy kaptan 2020 and food energy water flow qin et al 2022 as follows eq 8 8 s t 1 p 11 p 1 n p n 1 p nn s t where s t 1 and s t are the land use statuses of t 1 and t respectively pij is the transfer probability of the i type of land use converting into the j type of land use n is the number of land use types and 0 pij 1 i 1 n p ij 1 the transfer matrix of land use can reflect its structural characteristics the transformation scenario and the direction among different land use types and can provide insights into each type of transfer in and out as follows eq 9 9 s ij s 11 s 1 n s n 1 s nn i j 1 2 3 n where s ij is the area from type i to type j and i and j are land use types prior to and after the transfer respectively in this study the transfer matrix was used to describe the transition between different drought categories in central asia 3 2 5 wavelet analysis in this study two types of wavelet analysis were related to drought driving factors namely cross wavelet analysis and multifactor wavelet analysis cross wavelet analysis was used to analyze the relationship between changes in independent and dependent variables whereas multiple wavelet coherence mwc was used to analyze the correlation between multiple independent variables and a single dependent variable both have a wide range of applications in the field of hydrological causal analysis e g grinsted et al 2004 hu si 2016 for the mwc the 95 significance level was calculated based on the monte carlo method grinsted et al 2004 hu and si 2016 4 results 4 1 changes in terrestrial water components and related drought indexes in central asia fig 3 depicts the spatiotemporal distribution of multiple water components and their coupled dry wet index i e aswi at the land atmosphere interface in central asia in terms of spatial distribution the vpd in the western part of central asia which had a maximum value of 2 5 kpa month was greater than that in the eastern region fig 3a the monthly average vpd in the tianshan mountains was much lower than that in other regions in terms of temporal distribution although central asia is located deep in the eurasian hinterland there were clear seasonal fluctuations in the vpd time series in addition the vpd in the summer half of the year was significantly greater than that in the winter half of the year fig 3b the monthly average spatial distribution of sm at the ground surface was opposite to that of vpd thereby indicating that the sm at the ground surface of the tianshan mountains was significantly higher than that in the low altitude areas fig 3c because central asia is strongly impacted by its arid climate the scarcity and indistinct characteristics of owf were well reflected in the amsr wherein only higher values appeared along the rivers and lakes fig 3e the larger standard deviation among grids also highlighted the difference in surface water in central asia fig 3f however the spatial distribution of the drought index i e aswi was different from that of the above three water components in central asia based on the united states drought monitor usdm classification drought had largely occurred in the lower reaches of the amu darya and syr darya river basins whereas the western part of the tianshan mountains and western northern central asia were relatively humid fig 3g the temporal distribution of the aswi was highly uneven with significant and irregular fluctuations the significant drought occurred in 2007 which was followed by a wetting phenomenon fig 3h 4 2 spatiotemporal distribution of drought in central asia fig 4 illustrates the relationship between the total drought area tda lda and the number of drought patches for different months in central asia in terms of temporal distribution the maximum tda and lda in central asia were concentrated in 2007 respectively this implies that a serious drought occurred in central asia during this period fig 4a the tda was significant and negatively correlated with the drought patches p 0 001 r 2 0 7 whereas the correlation was clear with a larger tda and lda table 2 fig 4d for example in the first 10 of the tda the coefficient of determination between the tda and the lda was 0 25 p 0 05 whereas in the last 20 of the tda the coefficient of determination was 0 99 p 0 001 in contrast there were low levels of drought patches in 2007 and 2008 thereby implying that the drought grids were closely connected as the tda and lda decreased the drought patches increased fig 4c and f this result was consistent with the findings of previous studies aitekeyeva et al 2020 yang et al 2020a and has been demonstrated in the emergency events database guha sapir 2018 table 2 based on the usdm classification scheme the aswi was categorized into different drought categories fig 5 illustrates the frequency of different drought categories in central asia these results demonstrated that central asia experienced the highest frequency of abnormal droughts followed by moderate droughts and severe droughts whereas extreme droughts rarely occurred the frequency of abnormal drought was low in the tianshan mountains and high in low altitude areas the highest frequency was approximately 40 60 fig 5a however there was a gradually narrowing difference between drought frequency at low altitudes and high altitudes for the moderate drought category fig 5b the frequency of severe and extreme droughts at high altitudes was significantly higher than that at low altitudes fig 5c and d moran s i was applied to analyze the spatial autocorrelation of drought frequency for the different drought categories table 3 the results revealed that there was significant global spatial autocorrelation in the four drought categories in central asia spatial autocorrelation gradually weakened from abnormal moderate and severe to extreme droughts fig 6 presents the spatial distribution of drought duration and severity in central asia the maximum drought duration was observed in the lower reaches of the amu darya and syr darya river basins extending over 100 months whereas droughts in the tianshan mountains were relatively short lasting only a few months fig 6a in addition the spatial distribution of drought severity reflected similar patterns of drought duration whereby severity was relatively low in the tianshan mountains and high in areas of low altitude fig 6b there was a clear correlation between drought duration and drought severity the correlation coefficient was 0 76 p 0 05 fig 6d according to the drought severity to drought duration ratio there were no clear patterns in monthly average drought severity for low altitude areas whereas these patterns were more distinct in the tianshan mountains fig 6c fig 7 shows the centroid of the largest monthly drought patch in central asia the centroid of central asia was arbitrarily allocated as the origin and the horizontal and vertical lines passing through the origin were considered the coordinate axes the centroids of the lda in central asia were frequent in the first second and third quadrant and less frequent in the fourth quadrant this meant that the centroids of drought mainly appeared in the northeast northwest and southwest of central asia fig 7a the greater the proximity to the centroid of central asia the larger the drought area in contrast the greater the distance from the centroid the greater the occurrence of drought patches fig 7b d these findings are consistent with those in fig 4 fig 8 shows the spatial distribution of the centroid for annual drought in central asia which was derived from the annual average value of monthly aswi it was found that the annual drought centroid was mainly distributed in the second quadrant similarly the greater the proximity to the centroid the larger the drought area and the higher the lda 4 3 characteristics of spatial transformation for different drought categories the markov matrix was used to analyze changes in the drought grid in different periods 2003 2008 2008 2013 2013 2018 and 2003 2018 to understand the transformation between different drought categories in central asia fig 9 presents a chord diagram which represents the results of the markov matrix analysis for the spatial transformation of different drought categories in central asia for drought conversion characteristics during 2003 2008 approximately one third of nd grids had changed to ad although few ad grids had changed to md there were not many drought grids for other categories as such their characteristics were not prominent thus drought was the major phenomenon in central asia during 2003 2008 fig 9a in terms of drought characteristics from 2008 to 2013 approximately one sixth of nd grids had changed to ad whereas five sixths of ad grids had changed to nd and four fifths of md grids had changed to nd generally central asia showed a clear wetting trend for 2008 2013 fig 9b during 2013 2018 only a small part of the nd grids had changed to md whereas half of the ad grids had changed to nd and almost all the md grids had changed to nd in summary 2013 2018 exhibited a clear wetting trend in central asia fig 9c for the entire 2003 2018 period only a small part of the nd grids had changed to ad whereas almost half of the ad md and sd grids had changed to nd grids thus central asia experienced a clear wetting phenomenon in 2003 2018 which was characterized by successive episodes of drought and wetness 4 4 possible driving factors of drought in central asia the water vapor flux and wind direction at a typical atmospheric height 850 hpa were used to analyze mechanisms that drive the incidence of drought in central asia fig 10 shows the spatial distribution of atmospheric water vapor flux and wind direction during typical dry and wet periods as illustrated in fig 3a droughts occurred in april 2006 and wetness events occurred in april 2008 october 2014 and august 2016 it was found that atmospheric absolute humidity was relatively high in central asia during april 2006 whereas the water vapor flux in this location was low fig 10a in april 2008 atmospheric absolute humidity in central asia was relatively high the water vapor mainly originated from the arctic ocean and was weakly influenced by westerly winds fig 10b in october 2014 atmospheric absolute humidity in central asia was relatively high northern central asia was affected by cold water vapor from the arctic ocean whereas southern central asia was affected by the warm and wet water vapor from several indian ocean monsoons fig 10c however the absolute humidity in central asia was relatively small whereas water vapor flux was greatly influenced by arctic ocean circulation in august 2016 fig 10d in addition we also explored the influence of precipitation and temperature on the aswi among the direct major factors in central asia based on wavelet analysis fig 11 according to the cross wavelet analysis at the 8 16 month scale the effect of precipitation on the aswi showed a significant positive correlation i e the greater the precipitation the higher the aswi whereas the effect of temperature on the aswi mainly showed a significant negative correlation i e the higher the temperature the lower the aswi fig 11a 11d multiple wavelet analysis showed that both precipitation and temperature had significant effects on the aswi at the 8 16 month scale fig 11e therefore except for the influencing factors of atmospheric circulation both precipitation and air temperature were critical in the variation of the aswi in central asia this work reveals that drought dynamics in typical arid zones determined via geometric concepts i e drought centroid monitoring and conversion among different drought categories can be profoundly influenced by ice meltwater as well as precipitation and temperature 5 discussion the evaluation of drought events using remote sensing data compensates for the problems faced during real time monitoring of droughts in areas equipped with few monitoring stations or with missing data this method has great significance because it offers the ability to evaluate heavy losses caused by large scale drought disasters and avoid or minimize drought risk aghakouchak nakhjiri 2012 yin et al 2018 to quantify the uncertainty associated with the aswi du et al 2019 constructed and compared several traditional indexes grace drought severity index spi and pdsi with the aswi the results demonstrated that amsr lpdr may be used to monitor global changes in multiple water components and drought du et al 2019 however daily sm owf and vpd were disturbed by random noise thereby resulting in the reduced accuracy of amsr du et al 2017 for the sake of simplicity the thresholds i e vpd 0 48 kpa owf 0 057 sm 0 042 cm3 cm3 of sm ofw and vpd were defined based on amsr e data to maintain higher consistency with amsr 2 data du et al 2017 du et al 2018 the differences and similarities between the reference aswi and observed aswi were assessed du et al 2017 the mean absolute error was also quantified based on monthly aswi records and reference values to characterize the uncertainty du et al 2019 therefore the aswi can be applied to drought related studies amsr performs well in moderate and low vegetation coverage areas du et al 2017 du et al 2019 which is why the aswi is closely related to traditional drought indexes in the farmlands and grasslands of northern central asia this also proves why the drought events in central asia are mainly concentrated in the amu darya and syr darya basins this research also reveals that although central asia tended to be humid throughout the study period droughts continued to occur in the early stage e g 2004 2006 and 2008 and ceased as the region gradually became wet in the latter half of the period i e 2010 2018 furthermore the spatiotemporal characteristics of droughts in central asia presented in this study are consistent with the results of previous studies i e aitekeyeva et al 2020 chen et al 2018 yang et al 2020b and the drought events in central asia recorded in the emergency database table 3 guha sapir 2018 at high altitudes the hydrological environment of southern central asia and the tianshan mountains is dominated by glaciers seasonal snow cover alpine lakes and rivers these features are strongly impacted by precipitation and temperature and are decoupled with the local climate wang et al 2020 yang et al 2020a yang et al 2020b yu et al 2020 therefore changes in drought conditions in these regions are complex this may be the reason for the rare appearances of centroids of the largest drought patches in the second quadrant i e tianshan mountains or southern central asia which is consistent with the findings of klein et al 2012 and ta et al 2018 owing to the vast territory of central asia which is affected by multiple hydro meteorological factors in different regions the water vapor flux is extremely complex chen et al 2018 although the absolute humidity of the atmosphere in april 2006 was high there was little water vapor from the ocean owing to weak wind forces this inevitably resulted in droughts in april 2008 although cold water vapor had been transported from the arctic ocean to central asia the warm and humid atmospheric flow was rich thereby causing the monopolistic atmospheric mass to engulf central asia in october 2014 central asia was affected by cold and humid atmospheric flow from the north of the arctic ocean and the warm and humid atmospheric flow of the westerly belt this double vapor flux converged in the west of central asia thereby resulting in a humid environment fig 9c the abundant water vapor flux appeared north of 30 n in october 2016 whereas there was a large water vapor flux from the southwest thereby increasing the vapor flux in central asia fig 9d central asia was also impacted by specific teleconnection indexes e g north atlantic oscillation and el niño southern oscillation yu et al 2020 furthermore both precipitation and temperature had a significant effect on the dryness and wetness of central asia at an 8 16 month scale amsr uncertainty resulted in the inconsistency of hydrological factors in different regions of central asia du et al 2019 it is crucial to reduce the uncertainty of hydrological inversion of amsr for its application in hydrology and water resources the characteristics of the spatiotemporal transition of drought were closely related to the typical atmospheric water vapor flux 850 hpa thereby indicating that the changes in drought conditions in central asia were impacted by water vapor change particularly in the western and northern regions of central asia 6 conclusion the emergence of amsr has provided favorable data and technical support to monitor changes in various water components at the land atmosphere interface in this study multiple water components were coupled to an index to describe droughts using amsr remote sensing data the characteristics of the spatiotemporal transformation of drought wetness and the driving mechanisms of drought in central asia from july 2002 to december 2018 were investigated and analyzed based on the aswi the conclusions of this study are as follows 1 there were great spatial and temporal differences in various water components in central asia the dry and wet conditions in central asia also had clear spatial and temporal differences furthermore the most serious drought occurred in the lower reaches of the amu darya and syr darya river basins whereas the aswi time series exhibited irregular changes with a significant dry period succeeded by a wet period 2 the centroids of the largest drought patches with areas consistent with the tdas in central asia were mainly located in the first second and third quadrants and rarely located in the fourth quadrant this corresponded to the northeast northwest and southwest regions of central asia although there was continuous spatial transformation among different drought levels with significant global spatial autocorrelation the key event was the continuous drought from 2003 to 2008 in central asia which was followed by a gradual wetting period from 2008 to 2018 3 central asia is vast and impacted by many climatic factors the driving factors of drought change are complex and variable for typical drought records in recent years the variations in water vapor flux and absolute humidity in the typical barometric layer were attributed to the incidence of drought in 2006 and 2008 and the wetness in 2014 and 2016 however the application of the aswi is dependent on the revision of amsr parameters and reducing uncertainty declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the
