7380,the idea of the weighted function wf method for estimation of pearson type 3 pe3 distribution introduced by ma in 1984 has been revised and successfully applied for shifted inverse gaussian iga3 distribution also the conditions of wf applicability to a shifted distribution have been formulated the accuracy of wf flood quantiles for both pe3 and iga3 distributions was assessed by monte caro simulations under the true and false distribution assumption versus the maximum likelihood mlm moment mom and l moments lmm methods three datasets of annual peak flows of polish catchments serve the case studies to compare the results of the wf mom mlm and lmm performance for the real flood data for the hundred year flood the wf method revealed the explicit superiority only over the mlm surpassing the mom and especially lmm both for the true and false distributional assumption with respect to relative bias and relative mean root square error values generally the wf method performs well and for hydrological sample size and constitutes good alternative for the estimation of the flood upper quantiles keywords probability distribution skewness quantiles estimation shifted inverse gaussian pearson 3 type weighted functions 1 introduction and literature review in flood frequency analysis ffa and water management policy there is a need to estimate the maximum discharge of the flood wave for the given return period or probability of non exceedance f in other words the estimation of the upper quantiles by means of the sample of maximum annual flows in the river griffis and stedinger 2007 the statistical inference concerning the upper quantiles generates the problems of both the statistical and hydrological nature that are rarely treated jointly the statistical uncertainty of the upper quantiles estimators stems inter alia from short time series erroneous datasets wrong assumption of the model of annual flow maxima simplifications e g independent identically distributed elements in the sample and assumption on the stationarity of the river regime in order to improve the quality of the estimates of the flood quantiles the indispensable attempts to correct the quality of the datasets by e g engaging better measurement technology and hydrological information from various non systematic sources viglione et al 2013 should be supported by the proper hydrological models and methods of estimation both the input data in terms of their size and quality and the procedures of estimation understood as the distribution function and estimation method should be of the highest quality to obtain authoritative estimators of the annual peak flows strupczewski et al 2005 kochanek et al 2005 in the flood frequency analysis a probability density function pdf is fitted to the datasets by means of more or less subjective methods from among the positively skewed mostly two or three parameter continuous distribution functions e g katz et al 2002 cunnane 1985 1989 claims that some of these models were introduced to the hydrology because of their flexibility to adjust various shapes of peak discharge distributions often the theoretical arguments supporting the choice of a certain type of the ffa model can be easily undermined so more the empirical advantages of the model seem to be more important than the a priori argumentation in poland as in some other countries the pearson type 3 model pe3 was recommended in engineering applications for the estimation of annual peak flows in the polish rivers nowadays different models can be used e g weibull logpearson lognormal gev to name the most popular and different methods e g seasonal or regional approach estimated mainly by means of mlm however pe3 distribution still plays a role in the polish ffa as the reference or alternative model our former research strupczewski et al 2001 strupczewski and węglarczyk 2002c strupczewski et al 2003 strupczewski et al 2006 markiewicz et al 2015 indicate that the shifted inverse gaussian iga3 distribution function aka the shifted convective diffusion or the shifted wald distribution being an alternative to the shifted log normal distribution for medium skewness samples strupczewski et al 2002b is increasingly used in the ffa and represents relatively good upper quantiles in polish rivers regardless the flood generation processes and hydro morphology of the river one has to bear in mind however that the real model of the flood quantiles population is unknown and even though it was known it would have too many parameters to be estimated from short hydrological datasets all the more so the perfectly fitted model is only a part of the estimation procedure which consists also of the method of the estimation of quantiles the carefully selected method of estimation can help with the mitigation of the modelling and sampling errors as well as the measurement mistakes strupczewski et al 2002a b therefore statisticians and hydrologists have still been developing methods of estimations that could address certain problems of the ffa the historically first methods of estimation were based on graphical representation of the maximal annual flows and their plotting positions hazen 1930 although some of these visual concepts are still in use soon after the estimation methods evolved into statistical parametric paradigm and now the most popular methods used in at site ffa are the maximum likelihood e g kaczmarek 1977 rao hamed 2000 coles 2001 moments rao and hamed 2000 and l moments greenwood et al 1979 hosking 1986 hosking and wallis 1997 hosking 2006 recently bayesian methods and expected moments algorithm are of great interest especially when historical information is available e g paretti et al 2014 parkes and demeritt 2016 the mlm is said to provide asymptotically unbiased and optimal in the sense of minimum variance estimators of the parameters when the assumed model is true but it concentrates on the main mass of the probability far from the upper quantiles strupczewski 2000 its theoretical advantages fade when a wrong estimating model is fitted to the dataset strupczewski et al 2002b moreover the numerical algorithms of the mlm can fail for unknown reasons when the number of estimated parameter is large even more than 2 the main attractiveness of the lmm stems from the fact that the l moments are the linear of course combinations of the sample elements which does not lead to the multiplication of errors and guarantees the existence of all the theoretical l moments provided that the mean exists stedinger and vogel 1992 also the lmm can give equally good estimates of the upper quantiles as the mlm and is robust to the outliers but unfortunately it can be hardly applied to the pdfs that do not have the explicit mathematical form of the quantile including the pearson type 3 see hosking and wallis 1997 as well as the shifted inverse gaussian besides the lmm requires the order monotonically increasing samples that ruins the temporal order of the floods events and impedes the use of this method in the non stationary ffa as far as the mom is concerned the monte carlo simulations showed that for short samples and false assumption of the model this method gives smaller bias of the upper quantile estimators than the mlm strupczewski et al 2002a b strupczewski et al 2005 kochanek et al 2005 moreover the mom estimates are characterised by relatively low mean square error however especially the systematic error rises with the order of the moments because the sample elements are squared as in the variance var and coefficient of variation cv and cubed as in coefficient of skewness cs when the three parameter pdf is involved additionally the upper quantiles by mom are undervalued negative bias which is unwelcome when flood security systems are designed in the classical remarkable work just a moment wallis et al 1974 analysed in detail the positive and negative features of the mom for the most frequently used distribution functions including pearson type 3 of course the trio mom mlm and lmm does not exhaust the range of the methods of parameters estimation used nowadays in hydrology but their description falls far beyond the scope of this paper review applied 2012 the aforementioned features of the lmm and the mom their numerical simplicity encouraged the scientists to find a way to merge the advantages of both methods without their disadvantages i e keep the powers of the sample elements as low as possible as in the lmm and no need to have the explicit mathematical form of the quantile and to order samples mom one of such ideas first proposed by kartvelisvili as early as in 1963 was based on the generalisation of the moments by resigning from the traditional assumption that the moments are the functions of the sample elements raised to the positive integer power i e moments power 1 mean 2 variance 3 skewness etc e g ashkar bobee 1987 ashkar and mahdi 2003 2006 kochanek feluch 2016 despite the vast literature giving the impression that there is no room for other moment based method of upper quantiles estimation the two papers liang et al 2014 wang et al 2015 referring to the article of ma 1984 in chinese presented the new approach to the estimation of the pearson type 3 pdf pe3 where the cs is expressed as a function of the cv and two weighted central moments in consequence this new approach powered down the moments from 3 to 2 this idea known as the weighted function method wf was modified and developed by liang et al 2014 by further reduction of the power from 2 to 1 it resulted in the concept of the modified weighted function method mwf in the liang at al s paper the normal distribution plays the role of the weight function however the authors suggest that the other probability density function can also serve as the weight functions in the mwf method the monte carlo simulations showed that the wf and mwf for the pe3 generally proved to generate smaller bias of upper quantiles f 0 99 0 9999 for hydrological sample size n 20 50 compared with the results by the lmm also the mean square error of the upper quantiles estimators by the wf is competitive when the true that is pe3 model is assumed as far as the weight function is concerned its choice is constrained to the family of unimodal probability density functions however for a finite sample the selection of the weight function can affect the estimator of skewness and thus the usability of the wf method therefore we started our work from the assessment of the sensitivity of the estimate of the upper quantiles to the weight function choice for the pe3 distribution the six two parameter probability density functions serve as the alternatives for weight functions namely normal exponential exponential compare liang et al 2014 wang et al 2015 gumbel log normal gamma and inverse gaussian although the wf method derives from the mom and is intended to improve its deficiencies none of the two articles compares the accuracy of these methods also there was no comparison with the most popular mlm method so we compared of wf accuracy in respect to upper quantiles estimators with the outcomes of three routine ffa methods that is mom mlm and lmm in recognition of attractiveness of the wf method with regard to the pearson 3 distribution we searched for other probability distribution functions used in the ffa for which wf method would be applicable the conditions of wf applicability have been formulated and the wf has been successfully applied for the shifted inverse gaussian iga3 distribution with the same weighted functions as in pe3 by means of the monte carlo calculations we analyse the accuracy of the upper quantiles estimates by the procedures pe3 wf and iga3 wf with different weight functions and compare the results with classical procedures based on the mom mlm and lmm the last one for pe3 only the numerical experiment is carried out in the condition of true and false assumption of the parent distribution for various sample size coefficient of variation cv and asymmetry cs the values of moments selected for simulation experiments are representative annual maxima series of polish rivers showing the potential capacity of the wf methodology finally the best performing procedures will be applied to selected polish datasets to show the potential capacity of the wf methodology the results are widely discussed in this paper after the introduction and literature review section 1 we present the idea of the wf method section 2 indispensable conditions of the distribution functions for its use with the wf and its implementation for two distribution functions pe3 and iga3 section 3 gives the results of the comparison of the wf and other estimation techniques by numerical experiment the case study with regard to accuracy of upper quantiles estimation for the selected rivers in poland is presented in section 4 and the relevant conclusions and recommendations are given in the last section 2 method of the weighted function for estimation of distribution parameters 2 1 idea of the wf for the estimation of parameters the idea of the method of the weighted function ma 1984 and later the method of the modified weighted function liang et al 2014 was to reduce the power of the moments in traditional method of moments in fact this effect had been earlier achieved by the probability weighted moments greenwood et al 1979 whose linear combination is used in the l moments method hosking and wallis 1990 1997 these authors developed original methodology to the pearson type 3 shifted gamma distribution model the positive results of the wf method with respect to pe3 distribution urged us to look for other three parameter shifted distributions for which the wf method could be applied for this purpose by analysing the derivation of the wf estimation of pe3 skewness shortly presented below we formulated conditions for distribution functions necessary for the use of the wf method finding that they are completely fulfilled by the iga3 see table 1 the detailed derivation of the wf for the pe3 with comments one can find in liang et al 2014 so let us just draw up a sketch of the wf aspects with the liang s symbols the probability distribution function pdf of the pe3 table 1 1 f x β γ γ γ x μ γ 1 exp β x μ x μ where β γ μ are the scale shape and location parameters and γ is the gamma function after taking the natural logarithm of both sides of eq 1 and taking the derivatives one gets 2 df x dx γ 1 f x x μ β f x since e x μ 2σ cs where e x is the expected value σ the standard deviation the eq 2 can be re written as 3 x e x γ β df x dx 1 β x e x f x multiplication of both sides of the eq 3 by the weight function φ x and integration within the interval of the allowed argument x of the function eq 1 leads to 4 μ x e x γ β ϕ x df x dx dx μ 1 β x e x ϕ x f x dx if we consider that lim x μ f x lim x f x 0 then and integrate eq 4 by parts we get 5 μ μ ϕ x f x dx β μ x e x ϕ x f x dx μ x ϕ x f x dx knowing that β 2 σ cs and γ 4 cs 2 the eq 5 can be re written as 6 a cs 2 σ μ x e x ϕ x f x dx σ 2 μ ϕ x f x dx μ x e x ϕ x f x dx which shows the cs as the function of σ and e x regardless the form of the weight function φ x provided that the denominator of the eq 6a is not equal to zero the n element sample elements sorted in ascending order estimator for the cs 6 b c s 2 s i 1 n x i x ϕ x i s 2 i 1 n ϕ x i i 1 n x i x ϕ x i where x and s represent the sample mean and standard deviation respectively please note that the denominator is likely to be close to zero which may cause numerical calculation problems therefore function should be selected from the group to disable zeroing of the denominator for instance from the probability distribution functions it is difficult to formulate sufficient and necessary conditions for application of the wf method for other shifted distributions traditionally used in the ffa however some suggestions can be expressed first the method requires that the coefficient of skewness depends only on the shape parameter and that the shape parameter can be expressed in an explicit form in terms of cs the scale and location parameters should also be algebraic expressions of distribution moments to give the unique algebraic solution of three equations involving sample estimates of the first three central moments secondly the form of the derivative of ln f x should be a rational expression containing at most squares of the variable x μ what guaranties the effect of powering down i e the wf cs estimator is calculated on the base of lower than three power of data described below in the end of this section next the distribution parameters and the observation variable should be involved in the density function in a specific way that will enable the equation e g eq 5 for pe3 to be solved with respect to cs a good choice is to consider the exponential family for non shifted counterparts of candidate distributions which have some useful algebraic properties not all members of the exponential family in their shifted versions can be estimated by the wf method the possible candidates should be characterised by in non shifted version the pair of sufficient statistics equal to ln x x ln x 1 x or x 1 x to ensure the powering down effect considering the conditions mentioned above we point at another distribution function used in the ffa which can be estimated by the wf method that is shifted inverse gaussian distribution 2 2 derivation of wf estimate of cs for shifted inverse gaussian iga3 distribution as far as the shifted inverse gaussian model is concerned 7 f x α π x μ 3 exp α β α x μ 2 x μ α

single variable quadratic equation with an unknown represented by cs it means that it may have two one or none roots depending on values of a 0 a 1 a 2 b 0 b 1 and σ since the inverse gaussian distribution is a positively skewed distribution β 0 the negative root of the eq 14 is out of the cs domain however two positive roots are possible too according to our experimental calculations if

the wf the weight functions are the neutral element that would satisfy two requirements a φ x should be a continuous and differentiable function b ϕ x dx 1 it means that the probability density functions are good candidates for the weight functions liang et al 2014 and wang et al 2015 proposed normal distribution function and exp exp function as the weight functions we extended the list of the potential weight functions by gumbel log normal gamma and inverse gaussian probability distribution functions table 2 the list of the selected functions can be of course broadened by other pdfs but we concentrated on two parametric probability density functions commonly used in the ffa since according to the theoretical basis of the wf the choice of the weight function is indifferent regardless the type applied to the estimation of a model s parameters and quantiles the result should be the same in practice however especially for the small sample sizes the wide variety of forms of the weight functions the differences in the assumptions concerning their parameters and numerical constrains may lead to the noticeable differences in the results of the estimation that disappear with the growth of the sample length so for the practical application of the wf methodology the weight function should be chosen carefully to minimise the errors of estimation 2 4 the powering down of the moments by the wf the main advantage of the wf and its potential superiority over the other methods of estimation stems from the fact that it is supposed to power down the statistical moments used for the cs estimation in short the wf provides the opportunity to present the coefficient of skewness data cubed as a function of standard deviation data squared mean value original data i e raised to the first power and a two parameter weight function which requires dataset squared at maximum this would lead to the reduction of the errors whose magnitude rises with the power of moments as it is in case of the l moments data to the first power only on the other hand the moments with higher powers tend to describe the areas far from the main mass of probability i e the distribution function s tails important from the ffa point of view the estimator of the cs based on the method of moments for the gamma and inverse gaussian distributions is based on the first two moments and equals to 2cv and 3cv respectively so the cs is expressed by the data in first and second power and distribution dependent estimate obviously the method of moments gives non unique estimators since a rank of moments used in estimation procedure can be arbitrary to some extent if we consider three parameter distribution with location scale and shape parameters we need any three moments in estimation procedure and a natural choice is to assume the first three moments if so the mean variance and the skewness coefficient are distribution free many authors emphasize the large negative and significant sampling bias of skewness coefficient when estimated on the base of third second and first moments especially for small samples and proposed the bias correction methods e g wallis et al 1974 bobee and robitaille 1975 vogel and mcmartin 1991 and many others the wf method introduce another way to estimate skew in pe3 distribution by combining classical method of moments with weighted sample estimators of the first two moments in such way the cs estimator is distribution dependent in each estimation procedure an important part is an assessment of the uncertainty of parameters and quantiles let us note here that the mlm and wf are distributional oriented in the case of wrong distributional assumption mlm estimates of upper quantile are highly asymptotically biased strupczewski et al 2002a b and one can expect also a large model error for the wf estimates of upper quantile exceeding the asymptotic bias of lmm and mom liang et al 2014 and wang et al 2015 do not discuss the issue of the asymptotic bias model error of quantile estimates thus in order obtain joined estimation and model bias for the hydrological size of samples we applied the numerical experiments for comparison of the bias by the ffa estimation methods and the wf 3 the comparison of the wf with other estimation techniques by numerical experiment to compare the accuracy of the wf and maximum likelihood moments and l moments only for pe3 methods we first assume the knowledge of a probability distribution from which the samples are generated i e h true the hypothesis is true and we consider the length of the datasets compatible with hydrological realities the two cases are investigated i e when the parent distributions is pe3 and iga3 the true parent distribution in practical hydrological situation is not known therefore the applicability of the wf method should be also tested in close to reality conditions namely while dealing with wrongly assumed distribution used for flood quintile i e h false the hypothesis is false in such an experiment the estimating model differs from the parent distribution the two cases are described a when the parent distribution is pe3 and the estimating model is iga3 and b vice versa the three parameter pearson type 3 and shifted inverse gaussian serve here as parent distributions in simulation experiments which are performed for various coefficient of variation cv coefficient of asymmetry cs and two sample sizes i e n 50 and 100 with expected value m 10 the coefficients of variation equal 0 25 0 5 and 1 0 correspond to standard deviations 2 5 5 0 and 10 0 accordingly for both distributions the shape parameter values corresponding to the chosen cs values 1 0 2 0 and 3 0 are equal to 4 0 1 0 and 4 9 for the pe3 distribution and 4 5 9 8 and 0 5 respectively for the shifted gaussian distribution the application of the ffa statistical procedures for the records smaller than 50 elements is technically pointless while measurement series of annual peak flows larger than 100 elements rarely exist in data sets according to our analysis of the 38 annual maxima datasets collected over the years in gauging stations located in all bigger polish rivers the values of the coefficient of variation cv and coefficient of asymmetry cs selected for simulation experiments series fits perfectly within the range of values occurring in polish rivers compare kochanek et al 2012 table 1 markiewicz et al 2015 diagram 1 for brevity the results will be presented only for one parent mean m 10 three coefficients of variation i e cv 0 25 0 5 and 1 0 and three values of the coefficient of asymmetry cs 1 0 2 0 and 3 0 for each variant cv cs n 1000 series have been generated the selected upper quantiles of pe3 and iga3 models namely x f 0 9 and x f 0 99 are computed by means of the wf mlm mom and lmm estimation methods the relative bias rb and the absolute relative root mean square errors rrmse of the upper quantiles estimators x f 0 9 and x f 0 99 got by the each method serve here as goodness of fit criteria 23 rb x f e x f j x f x f 24 rrmse x f e x f j x f 2 x f where j subsequent monte carlo iteration xf true theoretical value of the upper quantile 3 1 case i known parent distribution h true the results of monte carlo experiment are shown in tables 3 and 4 for pearson type 3 and shifted inverse gaussian parent distribution respectively due to the limitation of the paper we decided to publish the tables for n 50 elements only however the results for n 100 are also taken into account and discussed when necessary as far as the pe3 model as the parent and estimation distributions are concerned table 3 one can easily see that for x f 0 9 and x f 0 99 the wf mostly gives lower both rb and rrmse than the mlm cells marked in green mom cells in blue or even both mlm and mom cells in orange regardless the cv and cs values and weight function it means that for pearson type 3 the wf is highly recommended as the practical alternative for classical methods of estimation the wf is often better than the lmm too but this case was discussed in liang et al 2014 and wang et al 2015 and was omitted in this work please note also that even for n 50 elements the choice of the weight function is indifferent for the pe3 the results for both the rb and rrmse and for both considered probabilities of non exceedance f 0 9 and f 0 99 are similar and quite stable within the context of the applied weight function to give the idea how the choice of the weight function influences the accuracy of the 100 year flood the table 7 is provided with the mean values and standard deviation of rb and rrmse of six weight functions additionally the results for n 100 not shown practically confirm all the conclusions drawn from the table 3 however the stability of the rb and rrmse values in terms of the weight function is even more visible nevertheless in practice for small sample sizes we recommend using all weight functions and accept the mean value of the estimator which gives satisfactory effects table 7 unfortunately the regular superior position of the wf over the classical methods of estimation does not hold for the iga3 model case table 4 the wf proves better than the mlm in green mom in blue or both methods in orange incidentally for selected cases of cv 0 25 and cv 0 5 the superiority of the wf grows with the value of the cs and indeed for big values of the cs that are far behind the range observed in polish annual peak flow datasets checked up to cs 10 the iga3 with the wf becomes highly competitive note that the method of l moments does not apply for iga3 model since the cumulative distribution function and quantile function of this model cannot be presented in a clear algebraic form although this is also the case for pearson 3 distribution hosking 1986 1990 elaborated an efficient algorithm dealing with the lmm estimation of pe3 distribution which we used in this study interesting is also that the variability of the results within the context of the weight function is much more visible than in case of the pe3 compare with table 7 the level of the similarity of results for various weight functions grow of course with n but due to the quadratic character of the cs equation eq 14 it does not reach the level of the similarity offered by the pe3 out of 6 variants of the weight functions the normal pdf weight function seems to be the best for the iga3 model however here as in the pe3 case we recommend using all weight functions and accept the mean value of the estimator superior over the rb by the competitive methods table 7 lower left panel in fact the wf table 7 presents the results of the weighted average but here all weights are equal to one though is it possible to refine and differentiate these weights by means of bayesian approach 3 2 case ii unknown parent distribution h false in practice the distribution function fitted to the sample is false so it is more realistic to consider the case when the parent and estimating models differ for the rational application it is worthy to evaluate the total error caused by false distribution assumption bear in mind that the overall bias of the estimators is the sum of the model and sampling bias which can be of reverse sign and compensate absolute values of each other thus ironically in some situations the total bias for false assumption of the model can be lower than for true assumption since the true distribution function is not known the assessment of the accuracy of the method can be carried out by applying the monte carlo tests to various true false pairs of distributions for a sample of a given parent distribution that is true t the quantile estimates got by a false f distribution depend on the estimation method and sample size in this paper two pairs are considered namely f pe3 t iga3 and f iga3 t pe3 the comparison of the robustness of the wf method with respect to classical methods mom mlm and lmm for misleading the distribution function will refer to rb and rrmse values for upper quantiles x f 0 90 and x f 0 99 the results of the numerical experiment are shown in tables 5 and 6 respectively and selected summary statistics of the relative bias results are shown in table 7 pair f pe3 t iga3 comparison of the results f pe3 t iga3 i e tables 5 and 7 upper right panel with the results f pe3 t pe3 i e tables 3 and 7 upper left panel shows significant reduction in the predominance of the wf estimate on mom and mlm but the wf method applied to pe3 still retains its first position among the methods considered used for samples from iga3 parent distribution however note that for cs 1 and f 0 90 in majority of the weight functions the wf method is better only than the mlm marked in green which come as no surprise because the sensitivity of mlm estimates to the error model of upper quantiles is greater than other estimation methods considered in other words the wf method provides here the accuracy comparable with the mom and lmm too one can observe high stability of the results with regard to the weight functions especially on the rrmse of course the differences between the various weight functions tent to disappear with growing n however when n 100 not shown the wf manifests its superiority over the mom and mlm only for x f 0 99 for this pair of true and false distribution functions the wf seems to be a good choice for estimating the upper quantiles in real ffa situations with short datasets regardless of the weight function choice like in h t case for practical applications we recommend use the estimator of the upper quantiles averaged over the weight functions table 7 upper right panel pair f iga3 t ipe3 comparison of results f iga3 t pe3 i e tables 6 and 7 lower right panel with the results for f iga3 t iga3 i e table 4 and table 7 lower left panel shows significant reduction in superiority of the estimates by the wf method over the results by the mom and mlm in terms of rb or rrmse in the case of wrong model selection the number of green cells in table 6 surpassing the amount of orange cells means also that the mom exceeds the accuracy of the wf method rather than the mlm the wf method revealed the superiority over mlm in the rb and rrmse values mainly for x f 0 99 the superiority of the wf over the mlm becomes even more visible for higher values of cs as the variability of the rb and rrmse for the wf within the context of the choice of weight function is high it is hard to recommend one weight function for practical use however one could coin a rule of thumb more skewed is your sample the more skewed weight function you should apply despite we recommend use averaged results by the weight functions table 7 the results for n 100 practically confirm the findings based on n 50 except the superiority of the wf over the mlm is even more evident note that the procedure iga3 wf performs better than the iga3 with competing methods mom mlm more often for the unknown underlying parent distribution than for the h true case especially for x f 0 99 table 7 4 case study accuracy of upper quantiles estimation for the selected rivers in poland the wf was used to estimate quantiles for three gauging stations on three polish rivers of flood regime warsaw nadwilanówka 1921 2013 at the middle course of the river vistula poznań at the river warta 1822 2013 and nowy targ at the river dunajec 1921 2013 see fig 1 these three stations are characterised by different flood generating processes the high flows in first station originate either from summer rainfalls or winter snowmelt mixed origin of floods in the second one the majority of peak flows come from winter snows and in the third station representing mountain regime from the summer rainfalls these three hydrostations characterise the regimes of polish rivers and constitute good examples of practical cases encountered by polish hydrological service the moment characteristics of the measurement samples for three gauges are presented in table 8 the graphs in fig 2 show the annual maxima for all three gauging stations grey with the results of modelling by two fitted probability distribution functions pe3 the left panel and iga3 the right panel with different methods of estimation since for large samples the choice of the weight function in the wf is of minor importance we present the results only for the normal distribution as the wmf s weight function black line which is compared to the results with method of moments blue line maximum likelihood red line and l moments only for pe3 green line the graphs show that in general both the pearson type 3 and shifted inverse gaussian models relatively well describe the variability of the annual maxima in three selected datasets although the methods of estimation differ much for smaller values of annual peak flows they converge for the middle values of the annual maxima and to certain extend diverge again for the highest floods in fact it is hard to point one universal estimation method that would be able to mimic annual maxima in their entire variability as for the smaller values the mlm seems to be an optimal solution for both pe3 and iga3 the middle and largest values are better represented by wf and or mom estimating methods out of the four three for the iga3 methods of estimation the novel wf method performs very well and being deprived of the negative characteristics of mom and mlm it constitutes good alternative for the estimation of the upper quantiles 5 conclusions and recommendations the method of the weighted function proposed for pearson type 3 distribution function by ma 1984 consists on the replacement of the estimation of the coefficient of skewness in mom by means of original way that does not require higher moments than the second ones the conditions of feasibility of the wf to other ffa models were formulated and then successfully applied the wf for the 3 parameter inverse gaussian model to assess the properties and capacity of the wf the comparison of the estimation accuracy of the upper quantiles estimates xf 0 9 and xf 0 99 with the mom and other classical methods of estimation namely mlm and lmm has been carried out additionally the sensitivity analysis of the outcomes by the wf with regard to the hydrological realism of polish rivers i e adequate lengths of datasets n 50 was performed the monte carlo simulation experiments were carried out to analyse the accuracy of upper quantiles estimators the relative bias and relative root mean square error served as the criteria of correctness the calculations based on 6 weight functions both for pe3 and iga3 first the knowledge of the parent distribution was assumed h true for various coefficients of variability cv 0 25 0 5 and 1 0 and coefficient of skewness cs 1 2 3 the results revealed i for the pe3 the wf manifested high competitiveness with regard to the mom lmm and supremacy over the mlm ii in most cases for the iga3 the mom and also mlm performed better in terms of the accuracy than the wf the lmm was not applied the simulations repeated for the case of unknown parent distribution h false revealed i for the pair f pe3 t iga3 despite noticeable drop in competitiveness the wf method remained on his leading position with respect to the upper quantiles estimation accuracy ii for the pair f iga3 t pe3 one can observe the improvement in competitiveness of the wf especially with respect to the mlm as far as the sensitivity of the results to the choice of one of the six weight functions is concerned for the pe3 the differences in rb and rrmse for various weight functions do not exceed a few percent and are of the same magnitude order as the respective differences for other three competitive estimation methods taking the pe3 with wf as the model for samples generated from iga3 in general we obtain the decrease in accuracy of the quantiles estimation regardless the weight function but the differences between both rbs and rrmses got for various weight function were even smaller than those between the classical methods much higher values ware observed for iga3 as true or false distribution the differences between results for various weight functions were bigger than those for the mom and mlm the inverse gaussian distribution having the tail heavier than the gamma can be more affected by cv underestimation strupczewski et al 2011 besides obviously heavy tailed distribution quantiles provide higher flood frequency estimates i e with large return period than thin tailed competitors even though they have the same statistical characteristics mean and variance so as the start point of the light or heavy tail is not a fixed value it happens that the 0 99 quantile lies below the tail s starting point in the context of light heavy definitions all in all we were unable to find a general pattern of the selection of optimal weight function for the models therefore we propose to use the averaged estimates over all six weight functions as the table 7 shows in such a case the rb of the upper quantile by the wf was much lower than for the classical estimation methods for small values of the cs the rb was small and hardly ever exceeded 2 so the differences between the rb with regard to the weight function are negligible however they rise very fast with the asymmetry of the distribution function the case study for the representative hydrostations showed clearly that wf is appropriate method for estimating of the moderate and high annual peak flows by means of pe3 and iga3 models but rather should not be used for small flows the competitiveness of the wf method is visible regardless of the regime of the river the choice of the weight function is practically indifferent to sum up being deprived of the negative features of the mlm and mom the wf constitutes interesting alternative for flood frequency analysis acknowledgments this research was carried out within statutory activities no 3841 e 41 s 2017 of the ministry of science and higher education of poland the authors would like to express their appreciation for eng noemi saraò for her help in computer calculations 
7380,the idea of the weighted function wf method for estimation of pearson type 3 pe3 distribution introduced by ma in 1984 has been revised and successfully applied for shifted inverse gaussian iga3 distribution also the conditions of wf applicability to a shifted distribution have been formulated the accuracy of wf flood quantiles for both pe3 and iga3 distributions was assessed by monte caro simulations under the true and false distribution assumption versus the maximum likelihood mlm moment mom and l moments lmm methods three datasets of annual peak flows of polish catchments serve the case studies to compare the results of the wf mom mlm and lmm performance for the real flood data for the hundred year flood the wf method revealed the explicit superiority only over the mlm surpassing the mom and especially lmm both for the true and false distributional assumption with respect to relative bias and relative mean root square error values generally the wf method performs well and for hydrological sample size and constitutes good alternative for the estimation of the flood upper quantiles keywords probability distribution skewness quantiles estimation shifted inverse gaussian pearson 3 type weighted functions 1 introduction and literature review in flood frequency analysis ffa and water management policy there is a need to estimate the maximum discharge of the flood wave for the given return period or probability of non exceedance f in other words the estimation of the upper quantiles by means of the sample of maximum annual flows in the river griffis and stedinger 2007 the statistical inference concerning the upper quantiles generates the problems of both the statistical and hydrological nature that are rarely treated jointly the statistical uncertainty of the upper quantiles estimators stems inter alia from short time series erroneous datasets wrong assumption of the model of annual flow maxima simplifications e g independent identically distributed elements in the sample and assumption on the stationarity of the river regime in order to improve the quality of the estimates of the flood quantiles the indispensable attempts to correct the quality of the datasets by e g engaging better measurement technology and hydrological information from various non systematic sources viglione et al 2013 should be supported by the proper hydrological models and methods of estimation both the input data in terms of their size and quality and the procedures of estimation understood as the distribution function and estimation method should be of the highest quality to obtain authoritative estimators of the annual peak flows strupczewski et al 2005 kochanek et al 2005 in the flood frequency analysis a probability density function pdf is fitted to the datasets by means of more or less subjective methods from among the positively skewed mostly two or three parameter continuous distribution functions e g katz et al 2002 cunnane 1985 1989 claims that some of these models were introduced to the hydrology because of their flexibility to adjust various shapes of peak discharge distributions often the theoretical arguments supporting the choice of a certain type of the ffa model can be easily undermined so more the empirical advantages of the model seem to be more important than the a priori argumentation in poland as in some other countries the pearson type 3 model pe3 was recommended in engineering applications for the estimation of annual peak flows in the polish rivers nowadays different models can be used e g weibull logpearson lognormal gev to name the most popular and different methods e g seasonal or regional approach estimated mainly by means of mlm however pe3 distribution still plays a role in the polish ffa as the reference or alternative model our former research strupczewski et al 2001 strupczewski and węglarczyk 2002c strupczewski et al 2003 strupczewski et al 2006 markiewicz et al 2015 indicate that the shifted inverse gaussian iga3 distribution function aka the shifted convective diffusion or the shifted wald distribution being an alternative to the shifted log normal distribution for medium skewness samples strupczewski et al 2002b is increasingly used in the ffa and represents relatively good upper quantiles in polish rivers regardless the flood generation processes and hydro morphology of the river one has to bear in mind however that the real model of the flood quantiles population is unknown and even though it was known it would have too many parameters to be estimated from short hydrological datasets all the more so the perfectly fitted model is only a part of the estimation procedure which consists also of the method of the estimation of quantiles the carefully selected method of estimation can help with the mitigation of the modelling and sampling errors as well as the measurement mistakes strupczewski et al 2002a b therefore statisticians and hydrologists have still been developing methods of estimations that could address certain problems of the ffa the historically first methods of estimation were based on graphical representation of the maximal annual flows and their plotting positions hazen 1930 although some of these visual concepts are still in use soon after the estimation methods evolved into statistical parametric paradigm and now the most popular methods used in at site ffa are the maximum likelihood e g kaczmarek 1977 rao hamed 2000 coles 2001 moments rao and hamed 2000 and l moments greenwood et al 1979 hosking 1986 hosking and wallis 1997 hosking 2006 recently bayesian methods and expected moments algorithm are of great interest especially when historical information is available e g paretti et al 2014 parkes and demeritt 2016 the mlm is said to provide asymptotically unbiased and optimal in the sense of minimum variance estimators of the parameters when the assumed model is true but it concentrates on the main mass of the probability far from the upper quantiles strupczewski 2000 its theoretical advantages fade when a wrong estimating model is fitted to the dataset strupczewski et al 2002b moreover the numerical algorithms of the mlm can fail for unknown reasons when the number of estimated parameter is large even more than 2 the main attractiveness of the lmm stems from the fact that the l moments are the linear of course combinations of the sample elements which does not lead to the multiplication of errors and guarantees the existence of all the theoretical l moments provided that the mean exists stedinger and vogel 1992 also the lmm can give equally good estimates of the upper quantiles as the mlm and is robust to the outliers but unfortunately it can be hardly applied to the pdfs that do not have the explicit mathematical form of the quantile including the pearson type 3 see hosking and wallis 1997 as well as the shifted inverse gaussian besides the lmm requires the order monotonically increasing samples that ruins the temporal order of the floods events and impedes the use of this method in the non stationary ffa as far as the mom is concerned the monte carlo simulations showed that for short samples and false assumption of the model this method gives smaller bias of the upper quantile estimators than the mlm strupczewski et al 2002a b strupczewski et al 2005 kochanek et al 2005 moreover the mom estimates are characterised by relatively low mean square error however especially the systematic error rises with the order of the moments because the sample elements are squared as in the variance var and coefficient of variation cv and cubed as in coefficient of skewness cs when the three parameter pdf is involved additionally the upper quantiles by mom are undervalued negative bias which is unwelcome when flood security systems are designed in the classical remarkable work just a moment wallis et al 1974 analysed in detail the positive and negative features of the mom for the most frequently used distribution functions including pearson type 3 of course the trio mom mlm and lmm does not exhaust the range of the methods of parameters estimation used nowadays in hydrology but their description falls far beyond the scope of this paper review applied 2012 the aforementioned features of the lmm and the mom their numerical simplicity encouraged the scientists to find a way to merge the advantages of both methods without their disadvantages i e keep the powers of the sample elements as low as possible as in the lmm and no need to have the explicit mathematical form of the quantile and to order samples mom one of such ideas first proposed by kartvelisvili as early as in 1963 was based on the generalisation of the moments by resigning from the traditional assumption that the moments are the functions of the sample elements raised to the positive integer power i e moments power 1 mean 2 variance 3 skewness etc e g ashkar bobee 1987 ashkar and mahdi 2003 2006 kochanek feluch 2016 despite the vast literature giving the impression that there is no room for other moment based method of upper quantiles estimation the two papers liang et al 2014 wang et al 2015 referring to the article of ma 1984 in chinese presented the new approach to the estimation of the pearson type 3 pdf pe3 where the cs is expressed as a function of the cv and two weighted central moments in consequence this new approach powered down the moments from 3 to 2 this idea known as the weighted function method wf was modified and developed by liang et al 2014 by further reduction of the power from 2 to 1 it resulted in the concept of the modified weighted function method mwf in the liang at al s paper the normal distribution plays the role of the weight function however the authors suggest that the other probability density function can also serve as the weight functions in the mwf method the monte carlo simulations showed that the wf and mwf for the pe3 generally proved to generate smaller bias of upper quantiles f 0 99 0 9999 for hydrological sample size n 20 50 compared with the results by the lmm also the mean square error of the upper quantiles estimators by the wf is competitive when the true that is pe3 model is assumed as far as the weight function is concerned its choice is constrained to the family of unimodal probability density functions however for a finite sample the selection of the weight function can affect the estimator of skewness and thus the usability of the wf method therefore we started our work from the assessment of the sensitivity of the estimate of the upper quantiles to the weight function choice for the pe3 distribution the six two parameter probability density functions serve as the alternatives for weight functions namely normal exponential exponential compare liang et al 2014 wang et al 2015 gumbel log normal gamma and inverse gaussian although the wf method derives from the mom and is intended to improve its deficiencies none of the two articles compares the accuracy of these methods also there was no comparison with the most popular mlm method so we compared of wf accuracy in respect to upper quantiles estimators with the outcomes of three routine ffa methods that is mom mlm and lmm in recognition of attractiveness of the wf method with regard to the pearson 3 distribution we searched for other probability distribution functions used in the ffa for which wf method would be applicable the conditions of wf applicability have been formulated and the wf has been successfully applied for the shifted inverse gaussian iga3 distribution with the same weighted functions as in pe3 by means of the monte carlo calculations we analyse the accuracy of the upper quantiles estimates by the procedures pe3 wf and iga3 wf with different weight functions and compare the results with classical procedures based on the mom mlm and lmm the last one for pe3 only the numerical experiment is carried out in the condition of true and false assumption of the parent distribution for various sample size coefficient of variation cv and asymmetry cs the values of moments selected for simulation experiments are representative annual maxima series of polish rivers showing the potential capacity of the wf methodology finally the best performing procedures will be applied to selected polish datasets to show the potential capacity of the wf methodology the results are widely discussed in this paper after the introduction and literature review section 1 we present the idea of the wf method section 2 indispensable conditions of the distribution functions for its use with the wf and its implementation for two distribution functions pe3 and iga3 section 3 gives the results of the comparison of the wf and other estimation techniques by numerical experiment the case study with regard to accuracy of upper quantiles estimation for the selected rivers in poland is presented in section 4 and the relevant conclusions and recommendations are given in the last section 2 method of the weighted function for estimation of distribution parameters 2 1 idea of the wf for the estimation of parameters the idea of the method of the weighted function ma 1984 and later the method of the modified weighted function liang et al 2014 was to reduce the power of the moments in traditional method of moments in fact this effect had been earlier achieved by the probability weighted moments greenwood et al 1979 whose linear combination is used in the l moments method hosking and wallis 1990 1997 these authors developed original methodology to the pearson type 3 shifted gamma distribution model the positive results of the wf method with respect to pe3 distribution urged us to look for other three parameter shifted distributions for which the wf method could be applied for this purpose by analysing the derivation of the wf estimation of pe3 skewness shortly presented below we formulated conditions for distribution functions necessary for the use of the wf method finding that they are completely fulfilled by the iga3 see table 1 the detailed derivation of the wf for the pe3 with comments one can find in liang et al 2014 so let us just draw up a sketch of the wf aspects with the liang s symbols the probability distribution function pdf of the pe3 table 1 1 f x β γ γ γ x μ γ 1 exp β x μ x μ where β γ μ are the scale shape and location parameters and γ is the gamma function after taking the natural logarithm of both sides of eq 1 and taking the derivatives one gets 2 df x dx γ 1 f x x μ β f x since e x μ 2σ cs where e x is the expected value σ the standard deviation the eq 2 can be re written as 3 x e x γ β df x dx 1 β x e x f x multiplication of both

consider that lim x μ f x lim x f x 0 then and integrate eq 4 by parts we get 5 μ μ ϕ x f x dx β μ x e x ϕ x f x dx μ x ϕ x f x dx knowing that β 2 σ cs and γ 4 cs 2 the eq 5 can be re written as 6 a cs 2 σ μ x e x ϕ x f x dx σ 2 μ ϕ x f x dx μ x e x ϕ x f x dx which shows the cs as the function of σ and e x regardless the form of the weight function φ x provided that the denominator of the eq 6a is not equal to zero the n element sample elements sorted in ascending order estimator for the cs 6 b c s 2 s i 1 n x i x ϕ x i s 2 i 1 n ϕ x i i 1 n x i x ϕ x i where x and s represent the sample mean and standard deviation respectively please note that the denominator is likely to be close to zero which may cause numerical calculation problems therefore function should be selected from the group to disable zeroing of the denominator for instance from the probability distribution functions it is difficult to formulate sufficient and necessary conditions for application of the wf method for other shifted distributions traditionally used in the ffa however some suggestions can be expressed first the method requires that the coefficient of skewness depends only on the shape parameter and that the shape parameter can be expressed in an explicit form in terms of cs the scale and location parameters should also be algebraic expressions of distribution moments to give the unique algebraic solution of three equations involving sample estimates of the first three central moments secondly the form of the derivative of ln f x should be a rational expression containing at most squares of the variable x μ what guaranties the effect of powering down i e the wf cs estimator is calculated on the base of lower than three power of data described below in the end of this section next the distribution parameters and the observation variable should be involved in the density function in a specific way that will enable the equation e g eq 5 for pe3 to be solved with respect to cs a good choice is to consider the exponential family for non shifted counterparts of candidate distributions which have some useful algebraic properties not all members of the exponential family in their shifted versions can be estimated by the wf method the possible candidates should be characterised by in non shifted version the pair of sufficient statistics equal to ln x x ln x 1 x or x 1 x to ensure the powering down effect considering the conditions mentioned above we point at another distribution function used in the ffa which can be estimated by the wf method that is shifted inverse gaussian distribution 2 2 derivation of wf estimate of cs for shifted inverse gaussian iga3 distribution as far as the shifted inverse gaussian model is concerned 7 f x α π x μ 3 exp α β α x μ 2 x μ α

distribution is a positively skewed distribution β 0 the negative root of the eq 14 is out of the cs domain however two positive roots are possible too according to our experimental calculations if

the wf the weight functions are the neutral element that would satisfy two requirements a φ x should be a continuous and differentiable function b ϕ x dx 1 it means that the probability density functions are good candidates for the weight functions liang et al 2014 and wang et al 2015 proposed normal distribution function and exp exp function as the weight functions we extended the list of the potential weight functions by gumbel log normal gamma and inverse gaussian probability distribution functions table 2 the list of the selected functions can be of course broadened by other pdfs but we concentrated on two parametric probability density functions commonly used in the ffa since according to the theoretical basis of the wf the choice of the weight function is indifferent regardless the type applied to the estimation of a model s parameters and quantiles the result should be the same in practice however especially for the small sample sizes the wide variety of forms of the weight functions the differences in the assumptions concerning their parameters and numerical constrains may lead to the noticeable differences in the results of the estimation that disappear with the growth of the sample length so for the practical application of the wf methodology the weight function should be chosen carefully to minimise the errors of estimation 2 4 the powering down of the moments by the wf the main advantage of the wf and its potential superiority over the other methods of estimation stems from the fact that it is supposed to power down the statistical moments used for the cs estimation in short the wf provides the opportunity to present the coefficient of skewness data cubed as a function of standard deviation data squared mean value original data i e raised to the first power and a two parameter weight function which requires dataset squared at maximum this would lead to the reduction of the errors whose magnitude rises with the power of moments as it is in case of the l moments data to the first power only on the other hand the moments with higher powers tend to describe the areas far from the main mass of probability i e the distribution function s tails important from the ffa point of view the estimator of the cs based on the method of moments for the gamma and inverse gaussian distributions is based on the first two moments and equals to 2cv and 3cv respectively so the cs is expressed by the data in first and second power and distribution dependent estimate obviously the method of moments gives non unique estimators since a rank of moments used in estimation procedure can be arbitrary to some extent if we consider three parameter distribution with location scale and shape parameters we need any three moments in estimation procedure and a natural choice is to assume the first three moments if so the mean variance and the skewness coefficient are distribution free many authors emphasize the large negative and significant sampling bias of skewness coefficient when estimated on the base of third second and first moments especially for small samples and proposed the bias correction methods e g wallis et al 1974 bobee and robitaille 1975 vogel and mcmartin 1991 and many others the wf method introduce another way to estimate skew in pe3 distribution by combining classical method of moments with weighted sample estimators of the first two moments in such way the cs estimator is distribution dependent in each estimation procedure an important part is an assessment of the uncertainty of parameters and quantiles let us note here that the mlm and wf are distributional oriented in the case of wrong distributional assumption mlm estimates of upper quantile are highly asymptotically biased strupczewski et al 2002a b and one can expect also a large model error for the wf estimates of upper quantile exceeding the asymptotic bias of lmm and mom liang et al 2014 and wang et al 2015 do not discuss the issue of the asymptotic bias model error of quantile estimates thus in order obtain joined estimation and model bias for the hydrological size of samples we applied the numerical experiments for comparison of the bias by the ffa estimation methods and the wf 3 the comparison of the wf with other estimation techniques by numerical experiment to compare the accuracy of the wf and maximum likelihood moments and l moments only for pe3 methods we first assume the knowledge of a probability distribution from which the samples are generated i e h true the hypothesis is true and we consider the length of the datasets compatible with hydrological realities the two cases are investigated i e when the parent distributions is pe3 and iga3 the true parent distribution in practical hydrological situation is not known therefore the applicability of the wf method should be also tested in close to reality conditions namely while dealing with wrongly assumed distribution used for flood quintile i e h false the hypothesis is false in such an experiment the estimating model differs from the parent distribution the two cases are described a when the parent distribution is pe3 and the estimating model is iga3 and b vice versa the three parameter pearson type 3 and shifted inverse gaussian serve here as parent distributions in simulation experiments which are performed for various coefficient of variation cv coefficient of asymmetry cs and two sample sizes i e n 50 and 100 with expected value m 10 the coefficients of variation equal 0 25 0 5 and 1 0 correspond to standard deviations 2 5 5 0 and 10 0 accordingly for both distributions the shape parameter values corresponding to the chosen cs values 1 0 2 0 and 3 0 are equal to 4 0 1 0 and 4 9 for the pe3 distribution and 4 5 9 8 and 0 5 respectively for the shifted gaussian distribution the application of the ffa statistical procedures for the records smaller than 50 elements is technically pointless while measurement series of annual peak flows larger than 100 elements rarely exist in data sets according to our analysis of the 38 annual maxima datasets collected over the years in gauging stations located in all bigger polish rivers the values of the coefficient of variation cv and coefficient of asymmetry cs selected for simulation experiments series fits perfectly within the range of values occurring in polish rivers compare kochanek et al 2012 table 1 markiewicz et al 2015 diagram 1 for brevity the results will be presented only for one parent mean m 10 three coefficients of variation i e cv 0 25 0 5 and 1 0 and three values of the coefficient of asymmetry cs 1 0 2 0 and 3 0 for each variant cv cs n 1000 series have been generated the selected upper quantiles of pe3 and iga3 models namely x f 0 9 and x f 0 99 are computed by means of the wf mlm mom and lmm estimation methods the relative bias rb and the absolute relative root mean square errors rrmse of the upper quantiles estimators x f 0 9 and x f 0 99 got by the each method serve here as goodness of fit criteria 23 rb x f e x f j x f x f 24 rrmse x f e x f j x f 2 x f where j subsequent monte carlo iteration xf true theoretical value of the upper quantile 3 1 case i known parent distribution h true the results of monte carlo experiment are shown in tables 3 and 4 for pearson type 3 and shifted inverse gaussian parent distribution respectively due to the limitation of the paper we decided to publish the tables for n 50 elements only however the results for n 100 are also taken into account and discussed when necessary as far as the pe3 model as the parent and estimation distributions are concerned table 3 one can easily see that for x f 0 9 and x f 0 99 the wf mostly gives lower both rb and rrmse than the mlm cells marked in green mom cells in blue or even both mlm and mom cells in orange regardless the cv and cs values and weight function it means that for pearson type 3 the wf is highly recommended as the practical alternative for classical methods of estimation the wf is often better than the lmm too but this case was discussed in liang et al 2014 and wang et al 2015 and was omitted in this work please note also that even for n 50 elements the choice of the weight function is indifferent for the pe3 the results for both the rb and rrmse and for both considered probabilities of non exceedance f 0 9 and f 0 99 are similar and quite stable within the context of the applied weight function to give the idea how the choice of the weight function influences the accuracy of the 100 year flood the table 7 is provided with the mean values and standard deviation of rb and rrmse of six weight functions additionally the results for n 100 not shown practically confirm all the conclusions drawn from the table 3 however the stability of the rb and rrmse values in terms of the weight function is even more visible nevertheless in practice for small sample sizes we recommend using all weight functions and accept the mean value of the estimator which gives satisfactory effects table 7 unfortunately the regular superior position of the wf over the classical methods of estimation does not hold for the iga3 model case table 4 the wf proves better than the mlm in green mom in blue or both methods in orange incidentally for selected cases of cv 0 25 and cv 0 5 the superiority of the wf grows with the value of the cs and indeed for big values of the cs that are far behind the range observed in polish annual peak flow datasets checked up to cs 10 the iga3 with the wf becomes highly competitive note that the method of l moments does not apply for iga3 model since the cumulative distribution function and quantile function of this model cannot be presented in a clear algebraic form although this is also the case for pearson 3 distribution hosking 1986 1990 elaborated an efficient algorithm dealing with the lmm estimation of pe3 distribution which we used in this study interesting is also that the variability of the results within the context of the weight function is much more visible than in case of the pe3 compare with table 7 the level of the similarity of results for various weight functions grow of course with n but due to the quadratic character of the cs equation eq 14 it does not reach the level of the similarity offered by the pe3 out of 6 variants of the weight functions the normal pdf weight function seems to be the best for the iga3 model however here as in the pe3 case we recommend using all weight functions and accept the mean value of the estimator superior over the rb by the competitive methods table 7 lower left panel in fact the wf table 7 presents the results of the weighted average but here all weights are equal to one though is it possible to refine and differentiate these weights by means of bayesian approach 3 2 case ii unknown parent distribution h false in practice the distribution function fitted to the sample is false so it is more realistic to consider the case when the parent and estimating models differ for the rational application it is worthy to evaluate the total error caused by false distribution assumption bear in mind that the overall bias of the estimators is the sum of the model and sampling bias which can be of reverse sign and compensate absolute values of each other thus ironically in some situations the total bias for false assumption of the model can be lower than for true assumption since the true distribution function is not known the assessment of the accuracy of the method can be carried out by applying the monte carlo tests to various true false pairs of distributions for a sample of a given parent distribution that is true t the quantile estimates got by a false f distribution depend on the estimation method and sample size in this paper two pairs are considered namely f pe3 t iga3 and f iga3 t pe3 the comparison of the robustness of the wf method with respect to classical methods mom mlm and lmm for misleading the distribution function will refer to rb and rrmse values for upper quantiles x f 0 90 and x f 0 99 the results of the numerical experiment are shown in tables 5 and 6 respectively and selected summary statistics of the relative bias results are shown in table 7 pair f pe3 t iga3 comparison of the results f pe3 t iga3 i e tables 5 and 7 upper right panel with the results f pe3 t pe3 i e tables 3 and 7 upper left panel shows significant reduction in the predominance of the wf estimate on mom and mlm but the wf method applied to pe3 still retains its first position among the methods considered used for samples from iga3 parent distribution however note that for cs 1 and f 0 90 in majority of the weight functions the wf method is better only than the mlm marked in green which come as no surprise because the sensitivity of mlm estimates to the error model of upper quantiles is greater than other estimation methods considered in other words the wf method provides here the accuracy comparable with the mom and lmm too one can observe high stability of the results with regard to the weight functions especially on the rrmse of course the differences between the various weight functions tent to disappear with growing n however when n 100 not shown the wf manifests its superiority over the mom and mlm only for x f 0 99 for this pair of true and false distribution functions the wf seems to be a good choice for estimating the upper quantiles in real ffa situations with short datasets regardless of the weight function choice like in h t case for practical applications we recommend use the estimator of the upper quantiles averaged over the weight functions table 7 upper right panel pair f iga3 t ipe3 comparison of results f iga3 t pe3 i e tables 6 and 7 lower right panel with the results for f iga3 t iga3 i e table 4 and table 7 lower left panel shows significant reduction in superiority of the estimates by the wf method over the results by the mom and mlm in terms of rb or rrmse in the case of wrong model selection the number of green cells in table 6 surpassing the amount of orange cells means also that the mom exceeds the accuracy of the wf method rather than the mlm the wf method revealed the superiority over mlm in the rb and rrmse values mainly for x f 0 99 the superiority of the wf over the mlm becomes even more visible for higher values of cs as the variability of the rb and rrmse for the wf within the context of the choice of weight function is high it is hard to recommend one weight function for practical use however one could coin a rule of thumb more skewed is your sample the more skewed weight function you should apply despite we recommend use averaged results by the weight functions table 7 the results for n 100 practically confirm the findings based on n 50 except the superiority of the wf over the mlm is even more evident note that the procedure iga3 wf performs better than the iga3 with competing methods mom mlm more often for the unknown underlying parent distribution than for the h true case especially for x f 0 99 table 7 4 case study accuracy of upper quantiles estimation for the selected rivers in poland the wf was used to estimate quantiles for three gauging stations on three polish rivers of flood regime warsaw nadwilanówka 1921 2013 at the middle course of the river vistula poznań at the river warta 1822 2013 and nowy targ at the river dunajec 1921 2013 see fig 1 these three stations are characterised by different flood generating processes the high flows in first station originate either from summer rainfalls or winter snowmelt mixed origin of floods in the second one the majority of peak flows come from winter snows and in the third station representing mountain regime from the summer rainfalls these three hydrostations characterise the regimes of polish rivers and constitute good examples of practical cases encountered by polish hydrological service the moment characteristics of the measurement samples for three gauges are presented in table 8 the graphs in fig 2 show the annual maxima for all three gauging stations grey with the results of modelling by two fitted probability distribution functions pe3 the left panel and iga3 the right panel with different methods of estimation since for large samples the choice of the weight function in the wf is of minor importance we present the results only for the normal distribution as the wmf s weight function black line which is compared to the results with method of moments blue line maximum likelihood red line and l moments only for pe3 green line the graphs show that in general both the pearson type 3 and shifted inverse gaussian models relatively well describe the variability of the annual maxima in three selected datasets although the methods of estimation differ much for smaller values of annual peak flows they converge for the middle values of the annual maxima and to certain extend diverge again for the highest floods in fact it is hard to point one universal estimation method that would be able to mimic annual maxima in their entire variability as for the smaller values the mlm seems to be an optimal solution for both pe3 and iga3 the middle and largest values are better represented by wf and or mom estimating methods out of the four three for the iga3 methods of estimation the novel wf method performs very well and being deprived of the negative characteristics of mom and mlm it constitutes good alternative for the estimation of the upper quantiles 5 conclusions and recommendations the method of the weighted function proposed for pearson type 3 distribution function by ma 1984 consists on the replacement of the estimation of the coefficient of skewness in mom by means of original way that does not require higher moments than the second ones the conditions of feasibility of the wf to other ffa models were formulated and then successfully applied the wf for the 3 parameter inverse gaussian model to assess the properties and capacity of the wf the comparison of the estimation accuracy of the upper quantiles estimates xf 0 9 and xf 0 99 with the mom and other classical methods of estimation namely mlm and lmm has been carried out additionally the sensitivity analysis of the outcomes by the wf with regard to the hydrological realism of polish rivers i e adequate lengths of datasets n 50 was performed the monte carlo simulation experiments were carried out to analyse the accuracy of upper quantiles estimators the relative bias and relative root mean square error served as the criteria of correctness the calculations based on 6 weight functions both for pe3 and iga3 first the knowledge of the parent distribution was assumed h true for various coefficients of variability cv 0 25 0 5 and 1 0 and coefficient of skewness cs 1 2 3 the results revealed i for the pe3 the wf manifested high competitiveness with regard to the mom lmm and supremacy over the mlm ii in most cases for the iga3 the mom and also mlm performed better in terms of the accuracy than the wf the lmm was not applied the simulations repeated for the case of unknown parent distribution h false revealed i for the pair f pe3 t iga3 despite noticeable drop in competitiveness the wf method remained on his leading position with respect to the upper quantiles estimation accuracy ii for the pair f iga3 t pe3 one can observe the improvement in competitiveness of the wf especially with respect to the mlm as far as the sensitivity of the results to the choice of one of the six weight functions is concerned for the pe3 the differences in rb and rrmse for various weight functions do not exceed a few percent and are of the same magnitude order as the respective differences for other three competitive estimation methods taking the pe3 with wf as the model for samples generated from iga3 in general we obtain the decrease in accuracy of the quantiles estimation regardless the weight function but the differences between both rbs and rrmses got for various weight function were even smaller than those between the classical methods much higher values ware observed for iga3 as true or false distribution the differences between results for various weight functions were bigger than those for the mom and mlm the inverse gaussian distribution having the tail heavier than the gamma can be more affected by cv underestimation strupczewski et al 2011 besides obviously heavy tailed distribution quantiles provide higher flood frequency estimates i e with large return period than thin tailed competitors even though they have the same statistical characteristics mean and variance so as the start point of the light or heavy tail is not a fixed value it happens that the 0 99 quantile lies below the tail s starting point in the context of light heavy definitions all in all we were unable to find a general pattern of the selection of optimal weight function for the models therefore we propose to use the averaged estimates over all six weight functions as the table 7 shows in such a case the rb of the upper quantile by the wf was much lower than for the classical estimation methods for small values of the cs the rb was small and hardly ever exceeded 2 so the differences between the rb with regard to the weight function are negligible however they rise very fast with the asymmetry of the distribution function the case study for the representative hydrostations showed clearly that wf is appropriate method for estimating of the moderate and high annual peak flows by means of pe3 and iga3 models but rather should not be used for small flows the competitiveness of the wf method is visible regardless of the regime of the river the choice of the weight function is practically indifferent to sum up being deprived of the negative features of the mlm and mom the wf constitutes interesting alternative for flood frequency analysis acknowledgments this research was carried out within statutory activities no 3841 e 41 s 2017 of the ministry of science and higher

7381,classification and similarity based methods which have recently received major attention in the field of surface water hydrology namely through the pub prediction in ungauged basins initiative have not yet been applied to groundwater systems however it can be hypothesised that the principle of similar systems responding similarly to similar forcing applies in subsurface hydrology as well one fundamental prerequisite to test this hypothesis and eventually to apply the principle to make predictions for ungauged groundwater systems is efficient methods to quantify the similarity of groundwater system responses i e groundwater hydrographs in this study a large spatially extensive as well as geologically and geomorphologically diverse dataset from southern germany and western austria was used to test and compare a set of 32 grouping methods which have previously only been used individually in local scale studies the resulting groupings are compared to a heuristic visual classification which serves as a baseline a performance ranking of these classification methods is carried out and differences in homogeneity of grouping results were shown whereby selected groups were related to hydrogeological indices and geological descriptors this exploratory empirical study shows that the choice of grouping method has a large impact on the object distribution within groups as well as on the homogeneity of patterns captured in groups the study provides a comprehensive overview of a large number of grouping methods which can guide researchers when attempting similarity based groundwater hydrograph classification keywords groundwater time series similarity hydrograph classification cluster analysis groundwater systems pub for groundwater 1 introduction 1 1 background this study is motivated by the perception that there is a lack of appropriate tools to assess the current and future status of groundwater resources in particular on the regional scale the regional scale here understood as regions e g catchments from 103 to 105 km2 in size plays an important role in water resources management as it connects global projections to local impacts vanroosmalen et al 2007 and allows the integrated analyses of feedback interactions between nature and society holman et al 2012 the dominant problem on the regional scale is scarcity and the uneven distribution of groundwater observations paired with the huge diversity of different hydrogeological conditions as a result observations are patchy in both space and time with respect to the observed variables groundwater quantity and quality and the selection of monitored hydrogeological formations see barthel 2014b for an extended discussion the surface water hydrological community has in a large joint effort systematically worked on solutions to cope with data scarcity with the pub initiative predictions in ungauged catchments hrachowitz et al 2013 one of the approaches developed by pub is based on similarity analysis of time series of hydrological observations and structural features of catchments see inductive reasoning in olden et al 2012 the underlying idea here is that similar catchments exposed to similar climate forcing will respond with similar discharge so that the hydrological signatures of ungauged catchments with known characteristics can be predicted based on its similarity to a gauged catchment mcdonnell and woods 2004 sivakumar and singh 2012 wagener et al 2007 these concepts however have not yet been extended into the groundwater field while hydrogeological classification has been applied in groundwater hydrology for a long time e g blank and schroeder 1973 this has been done with different objectives and usually with a low degree of formalisation the most common application is mapping and hydro stratigraphic classification of hydro geological formations aquifers aquitards but there is a lack of systematic similarity based concepts in groundwater research which has been pointed out by various authors e g de marsily et al 2005 voss 2005 see barthel 2014a for further discussion in the present study we perform a similarity search of groundwater dynamics as a first step in the direction of adopting and translating pub into the groundwater field by postulating that similar input to similar groundwater aquifers results in similar responses this is based on the intuition that the pattern of fluctuation of a groundwater hydrograph contains information on hydraulic functioning and properties of an aquifer as well as of catchment and climate characteristics cuthbert 2014 moon et al 2004 within a similarity based approach the straightforward approach for prediction is groundwater hydrograph classification the goal is to find structurally similar groups expressed by groundwater head variability maximizing hydrograph transferability to other groundwater systems of the same class in a later step hydrograph classes can be transferred based on climatic geologic and catchment characteristics with for example cross validated classification or regression analysis fig 1 olden et al 2012 translating the catchment similarity principles of pub to groundwater is a task with many challenges and unknowns which cannot be addressed in one single effort thus the present paper focusses on one of the basic prerequisites namely the similarity search of groundwater dynamics red box in fig 1 1 2 groundwater hydrograph classification as a starting point to the knowledge of the authors there have been few attempts to analyse the similarity of groundwater hydrographs systematically and to use this for comparison of groundwater systems or even making predictions by classification of groundwater hydrographs sequence of historical observations of groundwater levels at different locations the grouping of time series into classes according to similar fluctuation patterns is meant this can be manifested on different temporal scales inter annual annual and intra annual cluster analysis ca is commonly used for time series grouping a considerable number of clustering algorithms exist differing substantially in their grouping methodology and results aghabozorgi et al 2015 in the hydrological sciences time series clustering is commonly carried out using principal component analysis pca and ca or a combination thereof hannah et al 2000 kingston et al 2011 ouyang et al 2010 this is also reflected in the studies carried out on groundwater hydrographs using solely ca bloomfield et al 2015 kovács et al 2015 lafare et al 2015 only pca lischeid et al 2010 moon et al 2004 or pca and ca in combination machiwal and singh 2015 triki et al 2014 upton and jackson 2011 further to the knowledge of the authors the clustering algorithms k means and agglomerative hierarchical ca are exclusively applied where the latter is combined with different distance measures a different approach was taken by martens et al 2013 based on groundwater depth and inter and intra annual fluctuation adding to a classification framework proposed by van der sluijs and de gruijter 1985 this approach is not considered in this study due to the specific design for shallow aquifers the number of studies grouping groundwater hydrographs has grown increasingly in the past couple of years most studies apply one of the many available grouping algorithms but only bloomfield et al 2015 attempted to test two methods within a study this comparison is limited to a mathematical criterion and does not explicitly take into account the skill of methods in grouping similar dynamics with the exception of moon et al 2004 who used a relatively scarce dataset in space with a short record length in time the areal extent of the study areas are limited to under 10 000 km2 visual inspection and comparison of time series is frequently mentioned and used in the attempt to characterize similarity crochemore et al 2015 showed that the perception of similarity between time series of runoff by the human eye is often incongruent with the available numerical measures ehret and zehe 2011 and in a second iteration seibert et al 2016 develop a method with the aim to reproduce visual hydrograph comparison for streamflow records to the best of our knowledge there is no prior study on the relationship between visual perception and numerical measures of similarity of groundwater level time series or the systematic application of visual similarity based classification thus no conclusive guidance is available on grouping technique for groundwater hydrographs 1 3 objectives and scope the main aim of the present paper is to compare hydrograph classification methods with regard to homogeneity of groundwater dynamics this is done by an inter comparison of a number of numerical grouping methods as well as a heuristic visual classification vc of groundwater hydrographs differences between similarity based groundwater hydrograph grouping methods are carved out by means of a comparative study of a large number of previously used grouping methods thereby combinations of grouping algorithms and distance measures are introduced that haven t been previously tested in the hydrological sciences this is best achieved by applying the candidate methods to a large dataset larger in station number and geologically and geomorphologically more diverse than those in prior studies this study covers development of a visual hydrograph classification a feasibility test for similarity based hydrograph classification on the regional scale comparison of group homogeneity achieved with candidate hydrograph grouping methods with regard to qualitative performance based on visual inspection quantitative performance based on indices and hydrogeological characteristics 2 data and study area the greater part of the data used in this study was initially collected in the course of the glowa danube gd project which was realised by an interdisciplinary consortium of 17 research groups between 2001 and 2011 gd aimed to provide an integrated approach for predicting global change impacts to the hydrological cycle in the upper danube catchment udc fig 2 gd placed a strong focus on climate changes but was most interested in its various feedback mechanisms with other natural and societal processes of change demographic change economic change changes in resource use etc see e g barthel 2011 the udc is a large heterogeneous and mountainous catchment with altitudes ranging from 287 to 4049 m above sea level and a size of 77 000 km2 across the catchment annual precipitation ranges from 650 to over 2000 mm average annual temperature ranges from 4 8 to 9 c mauser and bach 2009 the population of the udc is approximately 11 5 million groundwater is the main source for water supply irrigation is not widely applied but steadily increasing an average temperature increase of 1 5 c over the 1960 2006 period has been determined and precipitation patterns have changed yet with no clear trend reiter et al 2012 a smaller part of the data used in this study stems from an adjacent region northwest of the upper danube catchment the neckar catchment which has an area of 14 000 km2 the data used in this study was primarily supplied by the state office of the environment in bavaria germany by the state office for environment measurements and nature conservation in baden württemberg bw and for austria at from the federal ministry for agriculture forestry environment and water management from their respective groundwater level monitoring databases also described by kumar et al 2016 groundwater level data from 4002 locations was available with variable sampling rates at different wells but also varying within a time series from hourly to monthly the length of the records is up to 100 years see römer et al 2016 for detailed information on data sources in order to be able to carry out this study on a diverse dataset an attempt was made to maximize the number of stations adhering to certain criteria steps outlined in table 1 the ability to capture multi annual and to a certain extent decadal periodicities in the groundwater signal while maximizing the number of wells points led to a choice of a 10 year measurement length step 2 the period with the largest number of concurrent time series agreeing to the criteria was 1987 1997 when being limited to time series with gap free minimum weekly measurement frequency step 3 after visual inspection and removal of wells influenced by human activity step 4 as described in section 3 1 512 groundwater hydrographs could be included in the study the dataset contains time series with a mixed daily weekly measurement frequency so for a consistent impression an aggregated weekly mean was chosen for all visual inspections and classifications in order to reduce noise from sample timing and circumvent problems with the curse of dimensionality steinbach et al 2004 a monthly average was calculated consistent with prior studies of groundwater hydrograph classification amplitude scaling of the data was performed by subtracting each value from the series mean shifting to mean and dividing by the standard deviation normalisation 3 methods 3 1 visual classification as a baseline in an effort to determine which classification approaches perform best an initial reference system was developed which allowed intuitive evaluation of results in absence of ground truth information as a first visual inspection the set of hydrographs immediately suggested grouping by visual appearance it was therefore decided to put some effort in performing a systematic visual classification and to use this as a reference system the term reference system might easily be misinterpreted here the biases and shortcomings introduced by visual inspection are fully respected see discussion below yet this study was encouraged by jain et al 2000 p 4 who claim the best pattern recognizers in most instances are humans yet we do not understand how humans recognize patterns having performed this study it was concluded that visual classification and visual inspection of time series are extremely valuable and unavoidable tasks essential to understanding data and group results notwithstanding these should not be overestimated these conclusions are confirmed by others who suggest visual inspection e g of simulated versus observed values as a standard procedure for calibration and validation in engineering practice ehret and zehe 2011 thus when using the term reference system with regard to vc it is not used in terms of better or worse but more or less different depending on scaling selected period and data point distance the visual appearance shape of the same data can diverge substantially each hydrograph see table 1 was therefore plotted four times i normalised for easy comparability of the hydrograph s general behaviour ii zero mean for clearer comparability of hydrograph dynamics iii with zero mean but only during a three year period 1994 1997 in order to more clearly identify shapes of peaks and yearly fluctuations and iv ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd plots eemd was proposed by wu and huang 2009 and can be used to decompose a signal into a number of intrinsic mode functions imfs here the first five imfs were plotted and subsequently used as a visual aid for separating dissimilar objects from vc groups fig 3 with the data selection procedures described in section 2 short and patchy hydrographs were already removed and excluded from vc however 101 hydrographs with irregular appearance were removed from the collection of hydrographs these were classified as irregular and excluded from the grouping as such irregularities in this sense could be anything that calls attention indicating sudden or continuous changes of hydrograph characteristics which the authors found difficult to explain without assuming drastic human interference or error it should be highlighted that hydrographs classified as irregular by visual inspection should not be regarded as unsuitable on the contrary they provide a wealth of information on system behaviour yet in the context of the present paper we disregarded irregular time series as each record receives its own group grouping of hydrographs was achieved by displaying the plots as icons on the computer screen and simply dragging the similar looking ones in separate sub folders this was done in several iterations i e by refining and revising the groups several times until a satisfactory result was obtained the visual description of the final grouping result was aided by spectral density estimates autocorrelation and first order time series of differences which was used to describe flashiness 3 2 candidate methods for formalising groundwater hydrograph classification for this study 32 different candidate grouping methods are tested a non clustering approach pca with varimax rotation and four clustering methods k means algorithm as well as three linkage based hierarchical clustering algorithms average complete and ward linkage the linkage based clustering algorithms are combined with different configurations of pairwise distance measures on the original and pca transformed time series distance measures and grouping methods are shown in table 2 and explained in more detail in supplement s1 all statistical analysis was carried out using the r software environment r development core team 2017 with packages tsclust montero and vilar 2014 and igraph csardi and nepusz 2006 3 3 evaluation of grouping results when evaluating grouping results in general no optimal strategy is available to test the quality and within group homogeneity of the groupings measuring the performance of classification strategies can be treated in very different ways depending on the nature of the information to be classified and the objective brun et al 2007 halkidi et al 2001 halkidi et al 2002a b when no true classification is known the available methods are based on minimization of numerical criteria which do not explicitly take into account specifics of the patterns of objects within a group what similarity of patterns of groundwater fluctuations are has not yet been universally formalized which renders any single optimization criteria insufficient for the cause therefore an ensemble based approach was chosen combining qualitative and quantitate types of evaluation visual inspection based grouping similarity based indices based and hydrogeological information based the visual inspection based evaluation was carried out in the following manner a the number of clusters is set equal to the classes found in vc this increases comparability of candidate methods with the vc while retaining the central tendency of characteristics in each grouping method b hydrographs within a class are plotted on top of each other with transparency to make visible distributions of groupings and deviations from an average group behaviour c spectral densities were estimated using fast fourier transform and plotted on top of each other with transparency d using the spectral densities dominant patterns were identified of inter annual annual and intra annual fluctuation aided by the spectral density plots the perception of homogeneity was evaluated in the time domain for each of the dominating patterns of fluctuation as in b dominating patterns of fluctuation were identified by visually finding the highest power of frequencies in spectral density plots relating to larger than yearly intra annual yearly annual and lower than yearly inter annual periodicity examples are given in fig 4 b with respective time series in fig 4a the classification for all candidate methods can be found in supplement s2 e for each type of dominant fluctuation pattern a ratio of homogeneous to total number within type was calculated which is averaged to obtain a total mean score for each candidate method f additionally cluster size distribution was calculated in order to quantitatively compare groupings with regard to group composition the adjusted rand index ari was used hubert and arabie 1985 which is based on the rand index rand 1971 the rand index can be used to calculate the overlap or similarity between two partitions it can be interpreted as a ratio between number agreements and number of disagreements between the partitions compared the ari is the rand index adjusted for chance grouping of elements with the generalized hypergeometric distribution ari yields values between 1 and 1 where 1 means that compared groupings are identical and 0 complete randomness of class membership negative values express disagreement below what is expected from a random clustering here we calculated the ari between the vc and each candidate method at cluster numbers 1 to 80 and selected the method with highest similarity to the vc among each algorithm by maximizing ari hydrographs within the same group should exhibit similar groundwater dynamics apart from evaluating this visually numerical indices that express different aspects of the dynamics of a time series can be calculated within surface hydrology this concept is commonly used for different purposes cf olden and poff 2003 less so in hydrogeology nevertheless we apply this concept to groundwater hydrograph for assessing within group homogeneity this is done by calculating mean within group standard deviation of each index for the candidate methods at cluster number 1 80 as well as vc the selected indices express contingency colwell 1974 i e dependency of fluctuation on season flashiness as described by the richards baker index baker et al 2004 as well as inter annual fluctuation the expression of martens et al 2013 was adapted to time series normalized for depth dependence further the pardé coefficient pardé 1933 was calculated as well as the julian date maxima and minima as implemented by castellarin et al 2001 subsequently the best performing method among each algorithm was selected by minimising the within group standard deviation of the index values a different way to evaluate the performance of a given classification method is to evaluate whether the found classifications make sense if compared with data sets of e g hydrogeological geographic and climatic information here we evaluated whether the members of groups of similar hydrographs originate from observation wells with similar geological characteristics this approach is problematic in its attempt to find the most suitable methods for grouping hydrographs as it relies on the assumption that the hypothesis to be tested similar input to similar structure similar output is true moreover if matching such information becomes implicitly part of the grouping strategy hydrograph grouping approaches will not be independent and thus transferable between regions of different characteristic therefore the approach can serve as an indicator for the reasonability of the hypothesis not as an independent test as the scope of this article is the determination of the most suitable approaches for hydrograph grouping and not to validate the underlying hypothesis as such depth to groundwater table and aquifer depth were chosen to exemplify how such tests could be performed for that purpose the within group standard deviation within each class of the grouping methods and the vc were calculated as well as the mean standard deviation and standard error of the standard deviation for each candidate method 4 results 4 1 visual classification groundwater level hydrographs at 512 locations were classified by eye into 34 perceived groups with 3 50 objects and a mean of 14 objects per group the vc was performed first on the raw equidistant plots in the time domain only in a second step the resulting groups were subdivided further based on visual similarity of the first five intrinsic mode functions of an ensemble empirical mode decomposition an attempt was made to sort the groups by degree of similarity where structural similarities between groups of classes were identified this resulted in a heuristic hierarchy to summarize the 34 groups into 6 structural groups where groundwater hydrographs from different observation wells which have been classed into the same group are plotted on top of each other in this study only one subgroup per structural group has been presented which can be seen in fig 5 a f the 28 subgroups not visualised here are briefly described and can be reviewed in the supplementary material a post hoc summary of the vc based on features exhibited in time domain frequency domain autocorrelation and first difference follows in the classes vc1 x here 1 identifies the structural group the x stands for a sub group therein time series with dominant multi year decadal periodicity fig 5a can be identified accordingly the peak of the spectral density is found at low frequencies the autocorrelation range is long and the flashiness is low see fig 6 a subgroups belonging to this structural group with growing numeration x have an increasing yearly seasonality associated with a peak in the spectral density at a frequency equivalent one year λ 0 12 ten time series were grouped into subgroup vc1 1 which are mostly located in sandstone aquifers particularly clustered in north eastern bavaria fig 7 those sandstones are typically large in horizontal and vertical spatial extent and often located deep covered by rocks of lower permeability vc2 x is dominated by yearly seasonality as seen in fig 5b but with a strong underlying multi year seasonality which is manifested in the spectral density with peaks at low frequencies and equivalent to one year see fig 6b one of the hydrographs in the example shown in fig 5b shows a deviating behaviour the strength of the yearly seasonality increases with growing numeration x vc 2 1 1 1 contains 8 hydrographs mainly situated in sand and gravel aquifers well distributed within the study area fig 7 but mainly located in the medium deep tertiary formations of the alpine forelands which extend as a belt from the western to the eastern border of the case study area vc3 x has strong yearly seasonality which can be seen in the spectral density with dominant peaks at frequency 1 12 and only gradually dampened autocorrelation range for yearly and negative for half yearly values see fig 5c and fig 6c differences between subgroups are mostly exhibited in the shape of the recession limb the subgroup vc3 2 1 contains 21 hydrographs which are mostly confined to a small geographical region and to shallow fluvial deposits in wetlands fig 7 in contrary to other fluvial deposits in narrow river valleys those wetland aquifers have a large horizontal extent in two dimensions vc4 x has a less regular yearly seasonality than vc3 x high peaks in some years and a relatively pronounced lower bound see fig 5d furthermore fluctuation within a year intra yearly fluctuation can be exhibited also seen in the spectral density fig 6d differences among the subgroups in vc4 x are mostly related to degree of flashiness of the signatures the 28 members of vc4 2 1 are geographically completely dispersed but mostly located in mesozoic karstic limestone vc5 x has a similar pattern but slightly weaker flashiness as vc4 x without the lower bound or the pronounced high peaks which can be seen in the more symmetrical time series of differences see fig 6e as can be seen from fig 7 stations within subgroup vc5 1 are dispersed but can be found in valleys where wells are mainly located in deeper terraces i e slightly consolidated fluvial gravel and sand in parts covered by thicker layers of younger sediments vc6 x has more regular flashiness than vc5 x see fig 5e and f apart from a regular yearly fluctuation a multi year variation can be seen which is similar in magnitude fig 6f the 17 stations grouped into vc6 2 2 are largely located in sand and gravel aquifers in river valleys when plotting groundwater hydrographs together classified by looking at the time domain only heterogeneities become visible in all groups this is even more apparent in the frequency domain and autocorrelation although it is generally accepted that the human eye is a great classifier establishing a vc of groundwater hydrographs proved difficult for a number of reasons two groups of problems occur which are rooted in the inevitability of subjective perception subjectivity of human eye brain grouping time series demands concentration to ensure consistency for long periods after an interruption a previous grouping work may seem inappropriate after having looked at one group intensively the focus on which characteristics should be prioritised may change going back to a result that was considered final some days ago can create disappointment and thus the wish to significantly reorganise the way the plots are prepared plays an outstanding role strong trends lead to bias in sorting different scales lead to prominence and the perceptual importance of different characteristics expectation of the classifying individual temptation to create equally distributed groups of hydrographs temptation to plot the location of different groups on maps or to relate the groups to geology depth and other features is strong doing this should be avoided as it as all other possible cross checks easily makes you rethink and reorganise your classifications to better match your initial expectations with visual classification largely homogeneous classes could be found with regard to perceived similarity of dynamics and hydrogeological conditions despite doubts arising from inherent subjectivity 4 2 candidate methods 4 2 1 visual inspection the five candidate grouping methods described in section 3 2 were applied to the data the number of groups was limited to 34 equivalent to the number identified by vc dendrograms produced by hierarchical ca were cut into 34 clusters while only the first 34 principal components were used for pca with varimax according to the kaiser criterion the ideal number of principal components for the dataset is 33 which also accounts for 95 of the variance the number of components according to the kaiser criterion was used for pca transformed hydrographs grouped through ca the groupings produced by the different algorithms differ moderately to strongly with regard to composition and number of hydrographs the different strengths and weaknesses of the grouping methods with regard to visual perception are summarised below k means clustering creates equally sized groups with only one cluster containing three or fewer objects groups with dominant yearly and intra yearly fluctuation patterns appear mostly homogenous more so than the groups created by vc groups of groundwater hydrographs which are dominated by low frequencies multi year seasonality are clustered into three moderately heterogeneous clusters see fig 8 these three groups exhibit a similar multi year periodicity but include a number of objects with a superposed yearly fluctuation pattern pca with varimax rotation produces equally distributed groups that are generally homogeneous except when it comes to dominant inter year periodicity a clear separation equivalent to hydrographs in vc1 x and vc2 x of the vc is not perceivable hydrographs dominated by inter year periodicity are grouped together with those with both strong inter yearly and yearly modes fig 9 resulting in five groups of heterogeneous clusters with many misclassified objects average linkage yields a number of large clusters with at least 100 objects and many small clusters in all cases of average linkage bar pca transformed hydrographs with a correlation distance more than a third of groups comprise a single object many of these objects classed as outliers could visually be matched to other classes in the grouping given the shape generally clusters are quite heterogeneous especially when it comes to clusters with hydrographs that are dominated by multi year seasonality among the average linkage groupings with different distance measures the most strongly deviating results are produced when clustering pca transformed time series with a euclidean distance nearly all objects are grouped into a single cluster while correlation on pca transformed data gives the most evenly distributed homogeneous groups discrete wavelet transform based distance achieves the highest combined homogeneity of 77 results from euclidean nse and correlation distance measures on the original time series give very similar cluster compositions and perform slightly better on groups with dominant annual periodicity however results in some clusters are merged and split differently dynamic time warping is particularly weak grouping time series with inter annual periodicity while generating most groups with dominant intra annual periodicity complete linkage clusters the time series into uniform and mostly homogenous groups although on average a fourth of clusters are small with only one to three objects groups that have more than three objects are mostly large holding more objects than expected when compared to the vc groups that contain hydrographs dominated by inter annual periodicity equivalent to vc1 x are not always well separated in some cases these are mixed with hydrographs exhibiting a strong yearly seasonality when considering the groupings with different distance measures the pca transformed time series with euclidean distance results in the least comprehensible results with large heterogeneous clusters while discrete wavelet transform based distance yield best performance with 85 homogeneity euclidean dynamic time warping and correlation distance measures on original time series yield homogeneous clustering results with around 65 homogeneity correlation distance splits some larger clusters which are merged with euclidean distance on original time series however groups containing such hydrographs are larger than expected given the vc ward linkage creates mostly homogenous and well separated clusters relatively equal in size without outliers and or small clusters the pattern of performance of distance measures is similar to complete and average linkage save a weak performance of correlation distance the distribution of objects in groups which is related to homogeneity varies greatly among the different candidate grouping methods while k means varimax and ward linkage generally have groups of equal sizes complete linkage and average linkage show more single object clusters see fig 10 cluster size proportions group size is equally distributed for groupings with pca transformed hydrographs the candidate methods average a perception of homogeneity of about 50 but with large variations among methods between with four methods reaching 100 for inter annual dominated patterns dwt average complete linkage per average linkage and kge complete linkage as seen in fig 10 under visual perception of homogeneity although the linkage algorithm hierarchical methods shows a strong impact on the group size distribution homogeneity performance of groups is generally dependent on distance measure and follows largely a similar pattern see mean score fig 10 in particular discrete wavelet transform performs well reaching homogeneity of around 80 nse and euclidean yield similar results with homogeneities around 65 while average linkage performs well with correlation based distances but heterogeneity when it comes to dynamic time warping complete and ward linkage shows performance of around 60 homogeneity 4 2 2 similarity of candidate methods to visual classification the adjusted rand index was calculated for group sizes from 1 to 80 between each candidate method and the vc fixed group size fig 11 generally ari between vc and the candidate methods remains below 0 4 which is not very high given that identical partitions yield 1 and randomness 0 most methods reach a plateau after which similarity falls or increases only slightly for those with similarity still rising at 80 clusters a fall would be expected at some cluster numbers thereafter when cluster composition should become purely random patterns of similarity among the hierarchical clustering methods are similar with kge and euclidean on pca except ward distance measures showing least similarity to the vc k means has the steepest increase but similarity fluctuates with a rising number of clusters after around 20 clusters this is most likely due to the k means algorithm getting stuck on local optima not finding the optimal cluster centroid at each iteration with higher number of clusters similarity at the peaks is on par with or higher than hierarchical clustering and particularly ward clustering which exhibits a similarly steep rise at lower cluster numbers a maximum similarity is reached at about 30 clusters and decreases from then on continuously the pattern seen for k means is similar to what can be seen with varimax rotation ward clustering has the relatively highest performance in ensemble for all distance measures but kge where the increase of similarity begins to level off at 20 30 clusters dynamic time warping exhibits the largest similarity and reaches this plateau at around the 34 groups found by vc correlation on pca shows the highest similarity with the vc substantially above other distance measures combined with average linkage most likely this is due to the more even distribution of cluster sizes as identified in section 4 2 1 euclidean distance combined with complete linkage reaches values over 0 4 but not until the data set is split into more than 60 clusters this is the overall highest similarity but only by a small margin where correlation and nse show a similar pattern distance measures where dissimilarity is measured in a transformed domain autocorrelation periodogram and discrete wavelet transform based exhibit a lower similarity compared to time domain based distance measures intuitively this indicates that euclidean nse dtw and correlation measures mimic best the perception of similarity as seen in the time domain 4 3 hydrologic index based evaluation within group numeric homogeneity measures of the 32 candidate methods as well as the vc were calculated homogeneity increases as the mean of within group standard deviation decreases here the homogeneity is compared by means of contingency flashiness inter annual fluctuation pardé coefficient julian date of yearly minima and maxima fig 12 presents the homogeneity dependent of cluster number 1 50 for k means varimax and the 3 best performing distance measures of each of the three hierarchical clustering algorithms within group homogeneity converges differently for different indices but increases strongest for cluster sizes 10 20 the hierarchical methods yield the highest homogeneity across the indices except for inter annual fluctuation where k means performs slightly better than ward among hierarchical methods only distance measures calculated in frequency and wavelet domain perform well average linkage shows the overall best performance together with the periodogram based distance for contingency flashiness and pardé coefficient the method s performance is also in par with the other best performing methods on inter annual fluctuation and the julian date indices for both complete and ward linkage discrete wavelet transform gives the highest within group homogeneity for all indices varimax rotation yields the most heterogeneous groups and shows instability from cluster number to cluster number this is even more pronounced in k means which has been seen in section 4 2 2 and is attributed to the algorithm getting stuck in local optima visual classification achieves at 34 clusters within group homogeneity in par with kmeans the best performing distance measures with complete and ward linkage only significantly surpassed by average linkage this indicates that visual classification is a viable tool for grouping hydrographs based on groundwater dynamics the homogeneity for julian date minima and maxima of the vc is comparatively low the reason for this might be the construction of the visual classification where overall dynamics patterns determine the group membership and not point to point distance which is important in a measure of extrema timing whether the measures compared here are important indicators for groundwater dynamics and its functional classification remains to be proved 4 4 relation of classification to geological features the usefulness of a descriptor as an explanatory variable in a predictive model is dependent on how much variability is introduced by the variable therefore the homogeneity of the groups found by the candidate grouping methods regarding depth to groundwater and aquifer depth are compared here homogeneity is expressed as the inversely related within group standard deviation as argued in section 3 3 of different geological descriptors is purely an indicator for homogeneity and not conclusive evidence for a superior candidate method fig 13 a and b show the means of within group standard deviation of depth to groundwater table and aquifer depth for each of the best performing distance measures among hierarchical methods as well as varimax and k means the shaded area shows the range of the standard deviation for each method i e the minimum and maximum within group standard variation for each cluster the number of clusters at which within group standard deviation approaches a minimum can be found at around ten clusters for most hierarchical methods the exception is ward clustering where convergence is reached later at 15 20 clusters the cluster number at which the minimum of within group standard deviation is reached is the partitioning optimum for a particular method and descriptor this means that even when partitioning the set of hydrographs into more individual groups the within group homogeneity doesn t increase the average standard deviation within a group at the optimum eleven clusters for the best performing average linkage with dynamic time warping is 4 4 m and 13 4 m for aquifer depth and depth to groundwater table respectively average and ward linkage performs best with dynamic time warping distance measures while complete linkage yields the lowest standard deviation combined with euclidean distance on pca transformed hydrographs in total average linkage has the lowest standard deviation as well as the narrowest range band of within group standard deviations k means and varimax hardly improve with increased number of clusters the decrease of cluster heterogeneity remains linear with instability as mentioned in sections above between 1 and 50 clusters the vc has an equivalent heterogeneity with regard to mean and range than k means and varimax the hierarchical methods are more homogeneous except for the case of complete linkage when looking at depth to groundwater table 5 discussion in this study methods for groundwater hydrograph classification were compared the overarching aim was to develop a methodology to classify groundwater dynamics with the future objective of arriving at a groundwater system classification that for example can be used for prediction and hydrological model enhancement vc gives the possibility to combine the pattern recognition capabilities of the human eye with expert knowledge the hydrograph classes created can be organised into a hierarchy sorting the classes by decreasing multi year fluctuations and increasing intra year fluctuations enhanced by eemd the similarity within groups and their relative homogeneity are perceivable by a general audience and experts alike however when scrutinising single groups visually it soon became clear that some objects might be misclassified and should instead belong to another group or even a new previously non existing group further certain similar groups could be merged in other words the sense of similarity is fuzzy and only partially reproducible thus categorisation determined by eyesight should be seen as purely heuristic although groundwater dynamics are well separated in vc making it a useful tool as a baseline for comparison of grouping methods the risk of inconsistency coupled with the apparent problems of the time consuming subjective act of visually classifying groundwater hydrographs create good incentives to explore the possibilities of an objective and systematic methodology that is scalable to larger datasets as the analysis shows among the 32 candidate grouping methods outcomes were very diverse fig 10 and similarity to the vc is generally low with regard to cluster composition fig 11 for instance average linkage which has previously only been used on streamflow hydrographs hannah et al 2000 gives few and large clusters and many outliers except for when used with pca transformed hydrographs and a correlation distance when more significant clusters are identified this uneven cluster size distribution does not mean that the groupings generated are worse than the visual classification as the perceived homogeneity of the produced clusters can be very high especially in combination with the distance measure discrete wavelet transform furthermore performance with regard to hydrogeological indices and geological descriptors was generally highest when using average linkage with dwt and dynamic time warping this measure also performs above average on visual homogeneity most studies dealing with groundwater hydrograph grouping use pca alone or a combination with ca moon et al 2004 triki et al 2014 upton and jackson 2011 all aspects considered the present study shows that the combination of pca and ca does not deliver the best results although this combination yields evenly sized groups they generally have lower cluster homogeneity than groupings performed on the original time series one exceptions is the similarity to vc with average linkage and correlation distance overall the reduction of information achieved with pca does not seem to improve the separating of the groundwater time series and in diverse datasets actually produces more disorderly groups of hydrographs pca has successfully been applied and is a popular pre processing tool in groundwater hydrograph grouping studies its use might be preferable for studies on smaller scales where fewer principal components and subsequently fewer classes are needed to express the major part of the variance of the dataset the most popular method in previous studies of groundwater hydrograph grouping has been complete linkage results for complete linkage are mixed for different configurations but visual inspection shows that the separation of different periodicities and thus homogeneity is slightly higher on average than other methods while numeric evaluation shows results in par or better than the vc extremes between distance measures and original or transformed are large which calls for a careful selection when using complete linkage in groundwater hydrograph classification k means has previously only been applied by bloomfield et al 2015 who demonstrated better cluster separation than the hierarchical complete linkage here this result is not confirmed but not rejected either visual homogeneity is relatively high around 70 but instability of cluster distribution is exhibited at cluster numbers higher than 20 this is especially worrisome given a high number of iterations in the centroid optimization this issue with the k means algorithm converging only to a local minimum at higher cluster numbers has earlier been documented by jain 2010 and lisboa et al 2013 this study confirms the results presented by machiwal and singh 2015 which showed that linkage has a major effect on the resulting grouping which is a result of the distribution of cluster sizes differences among groupings with different distance measures within a linkage method follow roughly the same pattern discrete wavelet analysis produces the groups with the highest homogeneity while euclidean and nse distances receive about the same scores correlation periodogram based and dynamic time warping distances can work similarly well but are more dependent on linkage algorithm the kge based distance measure does not create particularly homogeneous groups which is most likely due to the more skewed distribution of distances due to the relatively larger penalization of dissimilar time series pairs when comparing raw time series clustering to the vc reference the eye discovers similarity in groundwater hydrographs that have the same fluctuation pattern but phase differences or different trends and responses at certain periods during the comparison interval distance based measures in the time domain penalise this type of deviation except for dynamic time warping which could be expected to lead to a classification more similar to the vc the expectation that dtw is less sensitive to phase shifts than other distance measures and thus leads to improved classification could not be confirmed although all candidate methods produced visually inhomogeneous groups of time series they achieved equal or better results in the within group homogeneity evaluated with numerical and geological criteria than the vc this raises the questions if the vc is inadequate or if some information may be missing that is obvious visually but not manifested in the numerical measures a possible strategy would be to calculate relevant metrics and base groupings on distance between the metrics instead of on the proximity of original time series wang et al 2006 furthermore this approach could eliminate the need for concurrent time series a limiting factor in the proposed ensemble based classification a question that has not been addressed in this study is how to determine the appropriate number of clusters which remains one of the major difficulties for groundwater hydrograph classification and clustering in general jain 2010 in order to estimate the appropriate number of groups the adequate level of granularity can only be based on the predictive capability of the grouping the question is how many clusters result in a useful prediction as can be seen in this study in figs 12 and 13 different candidate methods reach optima at different cluster numbers dependent on the measure of interest this problem can only be solved iteratively to find the best trade off between generalization and variance reduction furthermore it should be performed dependent on physical descriptors and a specific application physical descriptors are influenced by a wider range of factors and are therefore not discussed in this present paper consequently this study does not yield a validation or absolute quality assessment of a classification approach but can only provide information on the relative capability of approaches with regard to homogenous grouping of groundwater dynamics 6 conclusions the purpose of this study was to investigate differences between groundwater hydrograph grouping methods the main focus was the methods relationship to intuitive perception of similarity and group homogeneity with regard to groundwater dynamics this was done by visual inspection as well as comparing with a heuristic visual classification assessing within group homogeneity according to a number of hydro geo logical indices and two hydrogeological descriptors based on this comparison it can be concluded that visual classification and visual inspection of hydrographs are valuable and unavoidable tasks essential to understand data and grouping results notwithstanding these should not be overestimated as they are subjective and do not guarantee optimal homogeneity of groups no single method closely resembled the visual classification nonetheless certain methods such as those based on discrete wavelet transform yield clusters with perceived homogeneity of up to 80 this method performs well also with regard to hydrological index based homogeneity consequently the perception of homogeneity is not necessarily related to similarity to the cluster composition of the visual classification methods comparing hydrographs with distance measures in the time domain are more skilful when describing similarity as seen by the human eye these measures do not perform equally well when looking for within group homogeneity based on specific aspects of the groundwater dynamics expressed by hydro geo logical indices this poses the question whether visual similarity is helpful in finding functionally similar groups which is hampered by inherent problems of subjectivity for further studies when attempting to improve grouping of groundwater hydrographs for instance for better separation of periodicities a more explicit characterisation of the aspects of groundwater dynamics is needed this could be achieved with an index based approach similar to grouping of streamflow regimes based on hydrologic indices candidates for such indices of groundwater hydrographs can for example

profit sectors we would like to thank erwin zehe and two anonymous reviewers for their valuable input to improve this manuscript appendix a candidate methods in detail distance measures to quantify the similarity and find groups of groundwater hydrographs with similar fluctuation patterns a measure of distance between the series is needed distance measures can be estimated on the raw values transformations and extracted features of the original time series lhermitte et al 2011 in many applications the standard and most straightforward distance measure for proximity of values is the euclidean distance eucl given two time series u u i u n and v v i v n a 1 d eucl u v i 1 n u i v i 2 for d euclidean to work adequately pairs of sequences must be well aligned in terms of timing which makes it not optimal for hydrological time series because it is sensitive to small offsets in timing to find similarity between two signals with variable shifts in time dynamic time warping dtw was developed by sakoe and chiba 1978 it determines the best alignment of two series i e minimising distance within a so called warping path w i by elastically shifting one of the series in time using dynamic programming technique the warping path is determined between all combinations of pairs of the two series u a and v b at the ith element of the path or can be constrained by a search window to compute the similarity matrix of groundwater hydrographs the distance metric for dtw is given by a 2 d dtw u v min r m i 1 n u a i v b i with r being pairs of elements of the two series and m the number of observations a measure commonly used to estimate dependency between hydrological series is the pearson product moment correlation coefficient it can also be used as a distance measure when trying to group series with respect to the degree of their linear relationship to turn the correlation coefficient ρ into a dissimilarity measure d cor the following formulation is generally used a 3 d cor u v 2 1 ρ u i v i in similarity search within group homogeneity can also be understood as how well one hydrograph can be expressed by another within the same group this corresponds to the goodness of fit between modelled and observed time series in hydrological models which is often assessed with the nash sutcliff efficiency nse and has previously been applied in groundwater jackson et al 2016 this has been implemented as a distance measure as well as was implemented as a distance measure a 4 d nse u v nse u i v i 1 another common measure for model efficiency is the kling gupta efficiency gupta et al 2009 which decomposes the sum of squares into three components for bias variation and correlation the aggregate kge was implemented as a distance measure a 5 d kge u v kge u i v i 1 three distance measures were included that do not measure dissimilarity in the time domain but in autocorrelation frequency and wavelet domain the implementations given by the tsclust package in r were applied montero and vilar 2014 the autocorrelation based dissimilarity d acf with a max lag of 5 years is defined as the euclidean distance between autocorrelation series compare eq a 1 the periodogram based distance measure d per is computed in an equal manner with euclidean distance periodograms are estimated using fast fourier transform by base functions in r r development core team 2017 the discrete wavelet transform based distance measure d dwt is computed by first extracting wavelet approximation coefficients with low redundancy in an unsupervised manner of both series subsequently the euclidean distance is calculated between the series coefficients when referring to methods in the manuscript using the above distance measures only the index such as nse in d nse is used pca transformation an additional approach was tested in this study which is based on transformations with pca the method aims to describe the major part of the total variation in a dataset of correlated variables x x 1 x q by a set of uncorrelated principal components pcs y y 1 y q this is done by eigenvalue decomposition of the dataset s correlation matrix transforming the variables into a lower dimensional space two different approaches were then followed i estimating dissimilarity between loadings with the correlation based pca cor or euclidean distance pca eucl and subsequent hierarchical clustering as well as ii applying varimax rotation kaiser 1958 to the pc loadings pca varimax this is done to maximise the sum of the variances of the squared loadings making the matching of groundwater hydrographs to classes possible cluster analysis in hierarchical clustering hca a hierarchy of clusters is constructed either in a top down divisive or a bottom up agglomerative fashion one of the major advantages of hca is that the final number of clusters does not have to be predefined but can be derived from the clustering result ratanamahatana et al 2010 in this study the more commonly used and computationally less expensive agglomerative clustering rui and wunsch 2005 is applied each object starts out as a cluster of its own and is then merged into larger clusters until the desired number is obtained in both methods clusters are split or merged according to some distance measure as well as based on what provides the largest between group dissimilarity three different algorithms for merging objects into clusters were used in this study i complete linkage uses the pair of observations with maximum distance between them as the cluster cluster distance also called furthest neighbour technique ii average linkage calculates the averages of the distances at each step of the joined cluster and the remaining objects and iii ward linkage selects clusters by minimising the error sum of squares between objects in a cluster at each step rui and wunsch 2005 provide more detailed information k means clustering is a partitioning method that minimises the sum of squared errors within each cluster and is therefore implicitly based on pairwise euclidean distance it is designed for minimising variance and works best for low dimensional spaces sun et al 2012 the number of clusters must be predefined and the number of inter cluster objects roughly the same size ratanamahatana et al 2010 the above mentioned properties make the method appear less useful for the task but it has previously successfully been employed in groundwater hydrograph clustering bloomfield et al 2015 appendix b supplementary data supplementary data associated with this article can

7381,classification and similarity based methods which have recently received major attention in the field of surface water hydrology namely through the pub prediction in ungauged basins initiative have not yet been applied to groundwater systems however it can be hypothesised that the principle of similar systems responding similarly to similar forcing applies in subsurface hydrology as well one fundamental prerequisite to test this hypothesis and eventually to apply the principle to make predictions for ungauged groundwater systems is efficient methods to quantify the similarity of groundwater system responses i e groundwater hydrographs in this study a large spatially extensive as well as geologically and geomorphologically diverse dataset from southern germany and western austria was used to test and compare a set of 32 grouping methods which have previously only been used individually in local scale studies the resulting groupings are compared to a heuristic visual classification which serves as a baseline a performance ranking of these classification methods is carried out and differences in homogeneity of grouping results were shown whereby selected groups were related to hydrogeological indices and geological descriptors this exploratory empirical study shows that the choice of grouping method has a large impact on the object distribution within groups as well as on the homogeneity of patterns captured in groups the study provides a comprehensive overview of a large number of grouping methods which can guide researchers when attempting similarity based groundwater hydrograph classification keywords groundwater time series similarity hydrograph classification cluster analysis groundwater systems pub for groundwater 1 introduction 1 1 background this study is motivated by the perception that there is a lack of appropriate tools to assess the current and future status of groundwater resources in particular on the regional scale the regional scale here understood as regions e g catchments from 103 to 105 km2 in size plays an important role in water resources management as it connects global projections to local impacts vanroosmalen et al 2007 and allows the integrated analyses of feedback interactions between nature and society holman et al 2012 the dominant problem on the regional scale is scarcity and the uneven distribution of groundwater observations paired with the huge diversity of different hydrogeological conditions as a result observations are patchy in both space and time with respect to the observed variables groundwater quantity and quality and the selection of monitored hydrogeological formations see barthel 2014b for an extended discussion the surface water hydrological community has in a large joint effort systematically worked on solutions to cope with data scarcity with the pub initiative predictions in ungauged catchments hrachowitz et al 2013 one of the approaches developed by pub is based on similarity analysis of time series of hydrological observations and structural features of catchments see inductive reasoning in olden et al 2012 the underlying idea here is that similar catchments exposed to similar climate forcing will respond with similar discharge so that the hydrological signatures of ungauged catchments with known characteristics can be predicted based on its similarity to a gauged catchment mcdonnell and woods 2004 sivakumar and singh 2012 wagener et al 2007 these concepts however have not yet been extended into the groundwater field while hydrogeological classification has been applied in groundwater hydrology for a long time e g blank and schroeder 1973 this has been done with different objectives and usually with a low degree of formalisation the most common application is mapping and hydro stratigraphic classification of hydro geological formations aquifers aquitards but there is a lack of systematic similarity based concepts in groundwater research which has been pointed out by various authors e g de marsily et al 2005 voss 2005 see barthel 2014a for further discussion in the present study we perform a similarity search of groundwater dynamics as a first step in the direction of adopting and translating pub into the groundwater field by postulating that similar input to similar groundwater aquifers results in similar responses this is based on the intuition that the pattern of fluctuation of a groundwater hydrograph contains information on hydraulic functioning and properties of an aquifer as well as of catchment and climate characteristics cuthbert 2014 moon et al 2004 within a similarity based approach the straightforward approach for prediction is groundwater hydrograph classification the goal is to find structurally similar groups expressed by groundwater head variability maximizing hydrograph transferability to other groundwater systems of the same class in a later step hydrograph classes can be transferred based on climatic geologic and catchment characteristics with for example cross validated classification or regression analysis fig 1 olden et al 2012 translating the catchment similarity principles of pub to groundwater is a task with many challenges and unknowns which cannot be addressed in one single effort thus the present paper focusses on one of the basic prerequisites namely the similarity search of groundwater dynamics red box in fig 1 1 2 groundwater hydrograph classification as a starting point to the knowledge of the authors there have been few attempts to analyse the similarity of groundwater hydrographs systematically and to use this for comparison of groundwater systems or even making predictions by classification of groundwater hydrographs sequence of historical observations of groundwater levels at different locations the grouping of time series into classes according to similar fluctuation patterns is meant this can be manifested on different temporal scales inter annual annual and intra annual cluster analysis ca is commonly used for time series grouping a considerable number of clustering algorithms exist differing substantially in their grouping methodology and results aghabozorgi et al 2015 in the hydrological sciences time series clustering is commonly carried out using principal component analysis pca and ca or a combination thereof hannah et al 2000 kingston et al 2011 ouyang et al 2010 this is also reflected in the studies carried out on groundwater hydrographs using solely ca bloomfield et al 2015 kovács et al 2015 lafare et al 2015 only pca lischeid et al 2010 moon et al 2004 or pca and ca in combination machiwal and singh 2015 triki et al 2014 upton and jackson 2011 further to the knowledge of the authors the clustering algorithms k means and agglomerative hierarchical ca are exclusively applied where the latter is combined with different distance measures a different approach was taken by martens et al 2013 based on groundwater depth and inter and intra annual fluctuation adding to a classification framework proposed by van der sluijs and de gruijter 1985 this approach is not considered in this study due to the specific design for shallow aquifers the number of studies grouping groundwater hydrographs has grown increasingly in the past couple of years most studies apply one of the many available grouping algorithms but only bloomfield et al 2015 attempted to test two methods within a study this comparison is limited to a mathematical criterion and does not explicitly take into account the skill of methods in grouping similar dynamics with the exception of moon et al 2004 who used a relatively scarce dataset in space with a short record length in time the areal extent of the study areas are limited to under 10 000 km2 visual inspection and comparison of time series is frequently mentioned and used in the attempt to characterize similarity crochemore et al 2015 showed that the perception of similarity between time series of runoff by the human eye is often incongruent with the available numerical measures ehret and zehe 2011 and in a second iteration seibert et al 2016 develop a method with the aim to reproduce visual hydrograph comparison for streamflow records to the best of our knowledge there is no prior study on the relationship between visual perception and numerical measures of similarity of groundwater level time series or the systematic application of visual similarity based classification thus no conclusive guidance is available on grouping technique for groundwater hydrographs 1 3 objectives and scope the main aim of the present paper is to compare hydrograph classification methods with regard to homogeneity of groundwater dynamics this is done by an inter comparison of a number of numerical grouping methods as well as a heuristic visual classification vc of groundwater hydrographs differences between similarity based groundwater hydrograph grouping methods are carved out by means of a comparative study of a large number of previously used grouping methods thereby combinations of grouping algorithms and distance measures are introduced that haven t been previously tested in the hydrological sciences this is best achieved by applying the candidate methods to a large dataset larger in station number and geologically and geomorphologically more diverse than those in prior studies this study covers development of a visual hydrograph classification a feasibility test for similarity based hydrograph classification on the regional scale comparison of group homogeneity achieved with candidate hydrograph grouping methods with regard to qualitative performance based on visual inspection quantitative performance based on indices and hydrogeological characteristics 2 data and study area the greater part of the data used in this study was initially collected in the course of the glowa danube gd project which was realised by an interdisciplinary consortium of 17 research groups between 2001 and 2011 gd aimed to provide an integrated approach for predicting global change impacts to the hydrological cycle in the upper danube catchment udc fig 2 gd placed a strong focus on climate changes but was most interested in its various feedback mechanisms with other natural and societal processes of change demographic change economic change changes in resource use etc see e g barthel 2011 the udc is a large heterogeneous and mountainous catchment with altitudes ranging from 287 to 4049 m above sea level and a size of 77 000 km2 across the catchment annual precipitation ranges from 650 to over 2000 mm average annual temperature ranges from 4 8 to 9 c mauser and bach 2009 the population of the udc is approximately 11 5 million groundwater is the main source for water supply irrigation is not widely applied but steadily increasing an average temperature increase of 1 5 c over the 1960 2006 period has been determined and precipitation patterns have changed yet with no clear trend reiter et al 2012 a smaller part of the data used in this study stems from an adjacent region northwest of the upper danube catchment the neckar catchment which has an area of 14 000 km2 the data used in this study was primarily supplied by the state office of the environment in bavaria germany by the state office for environment measurements and nature conservation in baden württemberg bw and for austria at from the federal ministry for agriculture forestry environment and water management from their respective groundwater level monitoring databases also described by kumar et al 2016 groundwater level data from 4002 locations was available with variable sampling rates at different wells but also varying within a time series from hourly to monthly the length of the records is up to 100 years see römer et al 2016 for detailed information on data sources in order to be able to carry out this study on a diverse dataset an attempt was made to maximize the number of stations adhering to certain criteria steps outlined in table 1 the ability to capture multi annual and to a certain extent decadal periodicities in the groundwater signal while maximizing the number of wells points led to a choice of a 10 year measurement length step 2 the period with the largest number of concurrent time series agreeing to the criteria was 1987 1997 when being limited to time series with gap free minimum weekly measurement frequency step 3 after visual inspection and removal of wells influenced by human activity step 4 as described in section 3 1 512 groundwater hydrographs could be included in the study the dataset contains time series with a mixed daily weekly measurement frequency so for a consistent impression an aggregated weekly mean was chosen for all visual inspections and classifications in order to reduce noise from sample timing and circumvent problems with the curse of dimensionality steinbach et al 2004 a monthly average was calculated consistent with prior studies of groundwater hydrograph classification amplitude scaling of the data was performed by subtracting each value from the series mean shifting to mean and dividing by the standard deviation normalisation 3 methods 3 1 visual classification as a baseline in an effort to determine which classification approaches perform best an initial reference system was developed which allowed intuitive evaluation of results in absence of ground truth information as a first visual inspection the set of hydrographs immediately suggested grouping by visual appearance it was therefore decided to put some effort in performing a systematic visual classification and to use this as a reference system the term reference system might easily be misinterpreted here the biases and shortcomings introduced by visual inspection are fully respected see discussion below yet this study was encouraged by jain et al 2000 p 4 who claim the best pattern recognizers in most instances are humans yet we do not understand how humans recognize patterns having performed this study it was concluded that visual classification and visual inspection of time series are extremely valuable and unavoidable tasks essential to understanding data and group results notwithstanding these should not be overestimated these conclusions are confirmed by others who suggest visual inspection e g of simulated versus observed values as a standard procedure for calibration and validation in engineering practice ehret and zehe 2011 thus when using the term reference system with regard to vc it is not used in terms of better or worse but more or less different depending on scaling selected period and data point distance the visual appearance shape of the same data can diverge substantially each hydrograph see table 1 was therefore plotted four times i normalised for easy comparability of the hydrograph s general behaviour ii zero mean for clearer comparability of hydrograph dynamics iii with zero mean but only during a three year period 1994 1997 in order to more clearly identify shapes of peaks and yearly fluctuations and iv ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd plots eemd was proposed by wu and huang 2009 and can be used to decompose a signal into a number of intrinsic mode functions imfs here the first five imfs were plotted and subsequently used as a visual aid for separating dissimilar objects from vc groups fig 3 with the data selection procedures described in section 2 short and patchy hydrographs were already removed and excluded from vc however 101 hydrographs with irregular appearance were removed from the collection of hydrographs these were classified as irregular and excluded from the grouping as such irregularities in this sense could be anything that calls attention indicating sudden or continuous changes of hydrograph characteristics which the authors found difficult to explain without assuming drastic human interference or error it should be highlighted that hydrographs classified as irregular by visual inspection should not be regarded as unsuitable on the contrary they provide a wealth of information on system behaviour yet in the context of the present paper we disregarded irregular time series as each record receives its own group grouping of hydrographs was achieved by displaying the plots as icons on the computer screen and simply dragging the similar looking ones in separate sub folders this was done in several iterations i e by refining and revising the groups several times until a satisfactory result was obtained the visual description of the final grouping result was aided by spectral density estimates autocorrelation and first order time series of differences which was used to describe flashiness 3 2 candidate methods for formalising groundwater hydrograph classification for this study 32 different candidate grouping methods are tested a non clustering approach pca with varimax rotation and four clustering methods k means algorithm as well as three linkage based hierarchical clustering algorithms average complete and ward linkage the linkage based clustering algorithms are combined with different configurations of pairwise distance measures on the original and pca transformed time series distance measures and grouping methods are shown in table 2 and explained in more detail in supplement s1 all statistical analysis was carried out using the r software environment r development core team 2017 with packages tsclust montero and vilar 2014 and igraph csardi and nepusz 2006 3 3 evaluation of grouping results when evaluating grouping results in general no optimal strategy is available to test the quality and within group homogeneity of the groupings measuring the performance of classification strategies can be treated in very different ways depending on the nature of the information to be classified and the objective brun et al 2007 halkidi et al 2001 halkidi et al 2002a b when no true classification is known the available methods are based on minimization of numerical criteria which do not explicitly take into account specifics of the patterns of objects within a group what similarity of patterns of groundwater fluctuations are has not yet been universally formalized which renders any single optimization criteria insufficient for the cause therefore an ensemble based approach was chosen combining qualitative and quantitate types of evaluation visual inspection based grouping similarity based indices based and hydrogeological information based the visual inspection based evaluation was carried out in the following manner a the number of clusters is set equal to the classes found in vc this increases comparability of candidate methods with the vc while retaining the central tendency of characteristics in each grouping method b hydrographs within a class are plotted on top of each other with transparency to make visible distributions of groupings and deviations from an average group behaviour c spectral densities were estimated using fast fourier transform and plotted on top of each other with transparency d using the spectral densities dominant patterns were identified of inter annual annual and intra annual fluctuation aided by the spectral density plots the perception of homogeneity was evaluated in the time domain for each of the dominating patterns of fluctuation as in b dominating patterns of fluctuation were identified by visually finding the highest power of frequencies in spectral density plots relating to larger than yearly intra annual yearly annual and lower than yearly inter annual periodicity examples are given in fig 4 b with respective time series in fig 4a the classification for all candidate methods can be found in supplement s2 e for each type of dominant fluctuation pattern a ratio of homogeneous to total number within type was calculated which is averaged to obtain a total mean score for each candidate method f additionally cluster size distribution was calculated in order to quantitatively compare groupings with regard to group composition the adjusted rand index ari was used hubert and arabie 1985 which is based on the rand index rand 1971 the rand index can be used to calculate the overlap or similarity between two partitions it can be interpreted as a ratio between number agreements and number of disagreements between the partitions compared the ari is the rand index adjusted for chance grouping of elements with the generalized hypergeometric distribution ari yields values between 1 and 1 where 1 means that compared groupings are identical and 0 complete randomness of class membership negative values express disagreement below what is expected from a random clustering here we calculated the ari between the vc and each candidate method at cluster numbers 1 to 80 and selected the method with highest similarity to the vc among each algorithm by maximizing ari hydrographs within the same group should exhibit similar groundwater dynamics apart from evaluating this visually numerical indices that express different aspects of the dynamics of a time series can be calculated within surface hydrology this concept is commonly used for different purposes cf olden and poff 2003 less so in hydrogeology nevertheless we apply this concept to groundwater hydrograph for assessing within group homogeneity this is done by calculating mean within group standard deviation of each index for the candidate methods at cluster number 1 80 as well as vc the selected indices express contingency colwell 1974 i e dependency of fluctuation on season flashiness as described by the richards baker index baker et al 2004 as well as inter annual fluctuation the expression of martens et al 2013 was adapted to time series normalized for depth dependence further the pardé coefficient pardé 1933 was calculated as well as the julian date maxima and minima as implemented by castellarin et al 2001 subsequently the best performing method among each algorithm was selected by minimising the within group standard deviation of the index values a different way to evaluate the performance of a given classification method is to evaluate whether the found classifications make sense if compared with data sets of e g hydrogeological geographic and climatic information here we evaluated whether the members of groups of similar hydrographs originate from observation wells with similar geological characteristics this approach is problematic in its attempt to find the most suitable methods for grouping hydrographs as it relies on the assumption that the hypothesis to be tested similar input to similar structure similar output is true moreover if matching such information becomes implicitly part of the grouping strategy hydrograph grouping approaches will not be independent and thus transferable between regions of different characteristic therefore the approach can serve as an indicator for the reasonability of the hypothesis not as an independent test as the scope of this article is the determination of the most suitable approaches for hydrograph grouping and not to validate the underlying hypothesis as such depth to groundwater table and aquifer depth were chosen to exemplify how such tests could be performed for that purpose the within group standard deviation within each class of the grouping methods and the vc were calculated as well as the mean standard deviation and standard error of the standard deviation for each candidate method 4 results 4 1 visual classification groundwater level hydrographs at 512 locations were classified by eye into 34 perceived groups with 3 50 objects and a mean of 14 objects per group the vc was performed first on the raw equidistant plots in the time domain only in a second step the resulting groups were subdivided further based on visual similarity of the first five intrinsic mode functions of an ensemble empirical mode decomposition an attempt was made to sort the groups by degree of similarity where structural similarities between groups of classes were identified this resulted in a heuristic hierarchy to summarize the 34 groups into 6 structural groups where groundwater hydrographs from different observation wells which have been classed into the same group are plotted on top of each other in this study only one subgroup per structural group has been presented which can be seen in fig 5 a f the 28 subgroups not visualised here are briefly described and can be reviewed in the supplementary material a post hoc summary of the vc based on features exhibited in time domain frequency domain autocorrelation and first difference follows in the classes vc1 x here 1 identifies the structural group the x stands for a sub group therein time series with dominant multi year decadal periodicity fig 5a can be identified accordingly the peak of the spectral density is found at low frequencies the autocorrelation range is long and the flashiness is low see fig 6 a subgroups belonging to this structural group with growing numeration x have an increasing yearly seasonality associated with a peak in the spectral density at a frequency equivalent one year λ 0 12 ten time series were grouped into subgroup vc1 1 which are mostly located in sandstone aquifers particularly clustered in north eastern bavaria fig 7 those sandstones are typically large in horizontal and vertical spatial extent and often located deep covered by rocks of lower permeability vc2 x is dominated by yearly seasonality as seen in fig 5b but with a strong underlying multi year seasonality which is manifested in the spectral density with peaks at low frequencies and equivalent to one year see fig 6b one of the hydrographs in the example shown in fig 5b shows a deviating behaviour the strength of the yearly seasonality increases with growing numeration x vc 2 1 1 1 contains 8 hydrographs mainly situated in sand and gravel aquifers well distributed within the study area fig 7 but mainly located in the medium deep tertiary formations of the alpine forelands which extend as a belt from the western to the eastern border of the case study area vc3 x has strong yearly seasonality which can be seen in the spectral density with dominant peaks at frequency 1 12 and only gradually dampened autocorrelation range for yearly and negative for half yearly values see fig 5c and fig 6c differences between subgroups are mostly exhibited in the shape of the recession limb the subgroup vc3 2 1 contains 21 hydrographs which are mostly confined to a small geographical region and to shallow fluvial deposits in wetlands fig 7 in contrary to other fluvial deposits in narrow river valleys those wetland aquifers have a large horizontal extent in two dimensions vc4 x has a less regular yearly seasonality than vc3 x high peaks in some years and a relatively pronounced lower bound see fig 5d furthermore fluctuation within a year intra yearly fluctuation can be exhibited also seen in the spectral density fig 6d differences among the subgroups in vc4 x are mostly related to degree of flashiness of the signatures the 28 members of vc4 2 1 are geographically completely dispersed but mostly located in mesozoic karstic limestone vc5 x has a similar pattern but slightly weaker flashiness as vc4 x without the lower bound or the pronounced high peaks which can be seen in the more symmetrical time series of differences see fig 6e as can be seen from fig 7 stations within subgroup vc5 1 are dispersed but can be found in valleys where wells are mainly located in deeper terraces i e slightly consolidated fluvial gravel and sand in parts covered by thicker layers of younger sediments vc6 x has more regular flashiness than vc5 x see fig 5e and f apart from a regular yearly fluctuation a multi year variation can be seen which is similar in magnitude fig 6f the 17 stations grouped into vc6 2 2 are largely located in sand and gravel aquifers in river valleys when plotting groundwater hydrographs together classified by looking at the time domain only heterogeneities become visible in all groups this is even more apparent in the frequency domain and autocorrelation although it is generally accepted that the human eye is a great classifier establishing a vc of groundwater hydrographs proved difficult for a number of reasons two groups of problems occur which are rooted in the inevitability of subjective perception subjectivity of human eye brain grouping time series demands concentration to ensure consistency for long periods after an interruption a previous grouping work may seem inappropriate after having looked at one group intensively the focus on which characteristics should be prioritised may change going back to a result that was considered final some days ago can create disappointment and thus the wish to significantly reorganise the way the plots are prepared plays an outstanding role strong trends lead to bias in sorting different scales lead to prominence and the perceptual importance of different characteristics expectation of the classifying individual temptation to create equally distributed groups of hydrographs temptation to plot the location of different groups on maps or to relate the groups to geology depth and other features is strong doing this should be avoided as it as all other possible cross checks easily makes you rethink and reorganise your classifications to better match your initial expectations with visual classification largely homogeneous classes could be found with regard to perceived similarity of dynamics and hydrogeological conditions despite doubts arising from inherent subjectivity 4 2 candidate methods 4 2 1 visual inspection the five candidate grouping methods described in section 3 2 were applied to the data the number of groups was limited to 34 equivalent to the number identified by vc dendrograms produced by hierarchical ca were cut into 34 clusters while only the first 34 principal components were used for pca with varimax according to the kaiser criterion the ideal number of principal components for the dataset is 33 which also accounts for 95 of the variance the number of components according to the kaiser criterion was used for pca transformed hydrographs grouped through ca the groupings produced by the different algorithms differ moderately to strongly with regard to composition and number of hydrographs the different strengths and weaknesses of the grouping methods with regard to visual perception are summarised below k means clustering creates equally sized groups with only one cluster containing three or fewer objects groups with dominant yearly and intra yearly fluctuation patterns appear mostly homogenous more so than the groups created by vc groups of groundwater hydrographs which are dominated by low frequencies multi year seasonality are clustered into three moderately heterogeneous clusters see fig 8 these three groups exhibit a similar multi year periodicity but include a number of objects with a superposed yearly fluctuation pattern pca with varimax rotation produces equally distributed groups that are generally homogeneous except when it comes to dominant inter year periodicity a clear separation equivalent to hydrographs in vc1 x and vc2 x of the vc is not perceivable hydrographs dominated by inter year periodicity are grouped together with those with both strong inter yearly and yearly modes fig 9 resulting in five groups of heterogeneous clusters with many misclassified objects average linkage yields a number of large clusters with at least 100 objects and many small clusters in all cases of average linkage bar pca transformed hydrographs with a correlation distance more than a third of groups comprise a single object many of these objects classed as outliers could visually be matched to other classes in the grouping given the shape generally clusters are quite heterogeneous especially when it comes to clusters with hydrographs that are dominated by multi year seasonality among the average linkage groupings with different distance measures the most strongly deviating results are produced when clustering pca transformed time series with a euclidean distance nearly all objects are grouped into a single cluster while correlation on pca transformed data gives the most evenly distributed homogeneous groups discrete wavelet transform based distance achieves the highest combined homogeneity of 77 results from euclidean nse and correlation distance measures on the original time series give very similar cluster compositions and perform slightly better on groups with dominant annual periodicity however results in some clusters are merged and split differently dynamic time warping is particularly weak grouping time series with inter annual periodicity while generating most groups with dominant intra annual periodicity complete linkage clusters the time series into uniform and mostly homogenous groups although on average a fourth of clusters are small with only one to three objects groups that have more than three objects are mostly large holding more objects than expected when compared to the vc groups that contain hydrographs dominated by inter annual periodicity equivalent to vc1 x are not always well separated in some cases these are mixed with hydrographs exhibiting a strong yearly seasonality when considering the groupings with different distance measures the pca transformed time series with euclidean distance results in the least comprehensible results with large heterogeneous clusters while discrete wavelet transform based distance yield best performance with 85 homogeneity euclidean dynamic time warping and correlation distance measures on original time series yield homogeneous clustering results with around 65 homogeneity correlation distance splits some larger clusters which are merged with euclidean distance on original time series however groups containing such hydrographs are larger than expected given the vc ward linkage creates mostly homogenous and well separated clusters relatively equal in size without outliers and or small clusters the pattern of performance of distance measures is similar to complete and average linkage save a weak performance of correlation distance the distribution of objects in groups which is related to homogeneity varies greatly among the different candidate grouping methods while k means varimax and ward linkage generally have groups of equal sizes complete linkage and average linkage show more single object clusters see fig 10 cluster size proportions group size is equally distributed for groupings with pca transformed hydrographs the candidate methods average a perception of homogeneity of about 50 but with large variations among methods between with four methods reaching 100 for inter annual dominated patterns dwt average complete linkage per average linkage and kge complete linkage as seen in fig 10 under visual perception of homogeneity although the linkage algorithm hierarchical methods shows a strong impact on the group size distribution homogeneity performance of groups is generally dependent on distance measure and follows largely a similar pattern see mean score fig 10 in particular discrete wavelet transform performs well reaching homogeneity of around 80 nse and euclidean yield similar results with homogeneities around 65 while average linkage performs well with correlation based distances but heterogeneity when it comes to dynamic time warping complete and ward linkage shows performance of around 60 homogeneity 4 2 2 similarity of candidate methods to visual classification the adjusted rand index was calculated for group sizes from 1 to 80 between each candidate method and the vc fixed group size fig 11 generally ari between vc and the candidate methods remains below 0 4 which is not very high given that identical partitions yield 1 and randomness 0 most methods reach a plateau after which similarity falls or increases only slightly for those with similarity still rising at 80 clusters a fall would be expected at some cluster numbers thereafter when cluster composition should become purely random patterns of similarity among the hierarchical clustering methods are similar with kge and euclidean on pca except ward distance measures showing least similarity to the vc k means has the steepest increase but similarity fluctuates with a rising number of clusters after around 20 clusters this is most likely due to the k means algorithm getting stuck on local optima not finding the optimal cluster centroid at each iteration with higher number of clusters similarity at the peaks is on par with or higher than hierarchical clustering and particularly ward clustering which exhibits a similarly steep rise at lower cluster numbers a maximum similarity is reached at about 30 clusters and decreases from then on continuously the pattern seen for k means is similar to what can be seen with varimax rotation ward clustering has the relatively highest performance in ensemble for all distance measures but kge where the increase of similarity begins to level off at 20 30 clusters dynamic time warping exhibits the largest similarity and reaches this plateau at around the 34 groups found by vc correlation on pca shows the highest similarity with the vc substantially above other distance measures combined with average linkage most likely this is due to the more even distribution of cluster sizes as identified in section 4 2 1 euclidean distance combined with complete linkage reaches values over 0 4 but not until the data set is split into more than 60 clusters this is the overall highest similarity but only by a small margin where correlation and nse show a similar pattern distance measures where dissimilarity is measured in a transformed domain autocorrelation periodogram and discrete wavelet transform based exhibit a lower similarity compared to time domain based distance measures intuitively this indicates that euclidean nse dtw and correlation measures mimic best the perception of similarity as seen in the time domain 4 3 hydrologic index based evaluation within group numeric homogeneity measures of the 32 candidate methods as well as the vc were calculated homogeneity increases as the mean of within group standard deviation decreases here the homogeneity is compared by means of contingency flashiness inter annual fluctuation pardé coefficient julian date of yearly minima and maxima fig 12 presents the homogeneity dependent of cluster number 1 50 for k means varimax and the 3 best performing distance measures of each of the three hierarchical clustering algorithms within group homogeneity converges differently for different indices but increases strongest for cluster sizes 10 20 the hierarchical methods yield the highest homogeneity across the indices except for inter annual fluctuation where k means performs slightly better than ward among hierarchical methods only distance measures calculated in frequency and wavelet domain perform well average linkage shows the overall best performance together with the periodogram based distance for contingency flashiness and pardé coefficient the method s performance is also in par with the other best performing methods on inter annual fluctuation and the julian date indices for both complete and ward linkage discrete wavelet transform gives the highest within group homogeneity for all indices varimax rotation yields the most heterogeneous groups and shows instability from cluster number to cluster number this is even more pronounced in k means which has been seen in section 4 2 2 and is attributed to the algorithm getting stuck in local optima visual classification achieves at 34 clusters within group homogeneity in par with kmeans the best performing distance measures with complete and ward linkage only significantly surpassed by average linkage this indicates that visual classification is a viable tool for grouping hydrographs based on groundwater dynamics the homogeneity for julian date minima and maxima of the vc is comparatively low the reason for this might be the construction of the visual classification where overall dynamics patterns determine the group membership and not point to point distance which is important in a measure of extrema timing whether the measures compared here are important indicators for groundwater dynamics and its functional classification remains to be proved 4 4 relation of classification to geological features the usefulness of a descriptor as an explanatory variable in a predictive model is dependent on how much variability is introduced by the variable therefore the homogeneity of the groups found by the candidate grouping methods regarding depth to groundwater and aquifer depth are compared here homogeneity is expressed as the inversely related within group standard deviation as argued in section 3 3 of different geological descriptors is purely an indicator for homogeneity and not conclusive evidence for a superior candidate method fig 13 a and b show the means of within group standard deviation of depth to groundwater table and aquifer depth for each of the best performing distance measures among hierarchical methods as well as varimax and k means the shaded area shows the range of the standard deviation for each method i e the minimum and maximum within group standard variation for each cluster the number of clusters at which within group standard deviation approaches a minimum can be found at around ten clusters for most hierarchical methods the exception is ward clustering where convergence is reached later at 15 20 clusters the cluster number at which the minimum of within group standard deviation is reached is the partitioning optimum for a particular method and descriptor this means that even when partitioning the set of hydrographs into more individual groups the within group homogeneity doesn t increase the average standard deviation within a group at the optimum eleven clusters for the best performing average linkage with dynamic time warping is 4 4 m and 13 4 m for aquifer depth and depth to groundwater table respectively average and ward linkage performs best with dynamic time warping distance measures while complete linkage yields the lowest standard deviation combined with euclidean distance on pca transformed hydrographs in total average linkage has the lowest standard deviation as well as the narrowest range band of within group standard deviations k means and varimax hardly improve with increased number of clusters the decrease of cluster heterogeneity remains linear with instability as mentioned in sections above between 1 and 50 clusters the vc has an equivalent heterogeneity with regard to mean and range than k means and varimax the hierarchical methods are more homogeneous except for the case of complete linkage when looking at depth to groundwater table 5 discussion in this study methods for groundwater hydrograph classification were compared the overarching aim was to develop a methodology to classify groundwater dynamics with the future objective of arriving at a groundwater system classification that for example can be used for prediction and hydrological model enhancement vc gives the possibility to combine the pattern recognition capabilities of the human eye with expert knowledge the hydrograph classes created can be organised into a hierarchy sorting the classes by decreasing multi year fluctuations and increasing intra year fluctuations enhanced by eemd the similarity within groups and their relative homogeneity are perceivable by a general audience and experts alike however when scrutinising single groups visually it soon became clear that some objects might be misclassified and should instead belong to another group or even a new previously non existing group further certain similar groups could be merged in other words the sense of similarity is fuzzy and only partially reproducible thus categorisation determined by eyesight should be seen as purely heuristic although groundwater dynamics are well separated in vc making it a useful tool as a baseline for comparison of grouping methods the risk of inconsistency coupled with the apparent problems of the time consuming subjective act of visually classifying groundwater hydrographs create good incentives to explore the possibilities of an objective and systematic methodology that is scalable to larger datasets as the analysis shows among the 32 candidate grouping methods outcomes were very diverse fig 10 and similarity to the vc is generally low with regard to cluster composition fig 11 for instance average linkage which has previously only been used on streamflow hydrographs hannah et al 2000 gives few and large clusters and many outliers except for when used with pca transformed hydrographs and a correlation distance when more significant clusters are identified this uneven cluster size distribution does not mean that the groupings generated are worse than the visual classification as the perceived homogeneity of the produced clusters can be very high especially in combination with the distance measure discrete wavelet transform furthermore performance with regard to hydrogeological indices and geological descriptors was generally highest when using average linkage with dwt and dynamic time warping this measure also performs above average on visual homogeneity most studies dealing with groundwater hydrograph grouping use pca alone or a combination with ca moon et al 2004 triki et al 2014 upton and jackson 2011 all aspects considered the present study shows that the combination of pca and ca does not deliver the best results although this combination yields evenly sized groups they generally have lower cluster homogeneity than groupings performed on the original time series one exceptions is the similarity to vc with average linkage and correlation distance overall the reduction of information achieved with pca does not seem to improve the separating of the groundwater time series and in diverse datasets actually produces more disorderly groups of hydrographs pca has successfully been applied and is a popular pre processing tool in groundwater hydrograph grouping studies its use might be preferable for studies on smaller scales where fewer principal components and subsequently fewer classes are needed to express the major part of the variance of the dataset the most popular method in previous studies of groundwater hydrograph grouping has been complete linkage results for complete linkage are mixed for different configurations but visual inspection shows that the separation of different periodicities and thus homogeneity is slightly higher on average than other methods while numeric evaluation shows results in par or better than the vc extremes between distance measures and original or transformed are large which calls for a careful selection when using complete linkage in groundwater hydrograph classification k means has previously only been applied by bloomfield et al 2015 who demonstrated better cluster separation than the hierarchical complete linkage here this result is not confirmed but not rejected either visual homogeneity is relatively high around 70 but instability of cluster distribution is exhibited at cluster numbers higher than 20 this is especially worrisome given a high number of iterations in the centroid optimization this issue with the k means algorithm converging only to a local minimum at higher cluster numbers has earlier been documented by jain 2010 and lisboa et al 2013 this study confirms the results presented by machiwal and singh 2015 which showed that linkage has a major effect on the resulting grouping which is a result of the distribution of cluster sizes differences among groupings with different distance measures within a linkage method follow roughly the same pattern discrete wavelet analysis produces the groups with the highest homogeneity while euclidean and nse distances receive about the same scores correlation periodogram based and dynamic time warping distances can work similarly well but are more dependent on linkage algorithm the kge based distance measure does not create particularly homogeneous groups which is most likely due to the more skewed distribution of distances due to the relatively larger penalization of dissimilar time series pairs when comparing raw time series clustering to the vc reference the eye discovers similarity in groundwater hydrographs that have the same fluctuation pattern but phase differences or different trends and responses at certain periods during the comparison interval distance based measures in the time domain penalise this type of deviation except for dynamic time warping which could be expected to lead to a classification more similar to the vc the expectation that dtw is less sensitive to phase shifts than other distance measures and thus leads to improved classification could not be confirmed although all candidate methods produced visually inhomogeneous groups of time series they achieved equal or better results in the within group homogeneity evaluated with numerical and geological criteria than the vc this raises the questions if the vc is inadequate or if some information may be missing that is obvious visually but not manifested in the numerical measures a possible strategy would be to calculate relevant metrics and base groupings on distance between the metrics instead of on the proximity of original time series wang et al 2006 furthermore this approach could eliminate the need for concurrent time series a limiting factor in the proposed ensemble based classification a question that has not been addressed in this study is how to determine the appropriate number of clusters which remains one of the major difficulties for groundwater hydrograph classification and clustering in general jain 2010 in order to estimate the appropriate number of groups the adequate level of granularity can only be based on the predictive capability of the grouping the question is how many clusters result in a useful prediction as can be seen in this study in figs 12 and 13 different candidate methods reach optima at different cluster numbers dependent on the measure of interest this problem can only be solved iteratively to find the best trade off between generalization and variance reduction furthermore it should be performed dependent on physical descriptors and a specific application physical descriptors are influenced by a wider range of factors and are therefore not discussed in this present paper consequently this study does not yield a validation or absolute quality assessment of a classification approach but can only provide information on the relative capability of approaches with regard to homogenous grouping of groundwater dynamics 6 conclusions the purpose of this study was to investigate differences between groundwater hydrograph grouping methods the main focus was the methods relationship to intuitive perception of similarity and group homogeneity with regard to groundwater dynamics this was done by visual inspection as well as comparing with a heuristic visual classification assessing within group homogeneity according to a number of hydro geo logical indices and two hydrogeological descriptors based on this comparison it can be concluded that visual classification and visual inspection of hydrographs are valuable and unavoidable tasks essential to understand data and grouping results notwithstanding these should not be overestimated as they are subjective and do not guarantee optimal homogeneity of groups no single method closely resembled the visual classification nonetheless certain methods such as those based on discrete wavelet transform yield clusters with perceived homogeneity of up to 80 this method performs well also with regard to hydrological index based homogeneity consequently the perception of homogeneity is not necessarily related to similarity to the cluster composition of the visual classification methods comparing hydrographs with distance measures in the time domain are more skilful when describing similarity as seen by the human eye these measures do not perform equally well when looking for within group homogeneity based on specific aspects of the groundwater dynamics expressed by hydro geo logical indices this poses the question whether visual similarity is helpful in finding functionally similar groups which is hampered by inherent problems of subjectivity for further studies when attempting to improve grouping of groundwater hydrographs for instance for better separation of periodicities a more explicit characterisation of the aspects of groundwater dynamics is needed this could be achieved with an index based approach similar to grouping of streamflow regimes based on hydrologic indices candidates for such indices of groundwater hydrographs can for example

profit sectors we would like to thank erwin zehe and two anonymous reviewers for their valuable input to improve this manuscript appendix a candidate methods in detail distance measures to quantify the similarity and find groups of groundwater hydrographs with similar fluctuation patterns a measure of distance between the series is needed distance measures can be estimated on the raw values transformations and extracted features of the original time series lhermitte et al 2011 in many applications the standard and most straightforward distance measure for proximity of values is the euclidean distance eucl given two time series u u i u n and v v i v n a 1 d eucl u v i 1 n u i v i 2 for d euclidean to work adequately pairs of sequences must be well aligned in terms of timing which makes it not optimal for hydrological time series because it is sensitive to small offsets in timing to find similarity between two signals with variable shifts in time dynamic time warping dtw was developed by sakoe and chiba 1978 it determines the best alignment of two series i e minimising distance within a so called warping path w i by elastically shifting one of the series in time using dynamic programming technique the warping path is determined between all combinations of pairs of the two series u a and v b at the ith element of the path or can be constrained by a search window to compute the similarity matrix of groundwater hydrographs the distance metric for dtw is given by a 2 d dtw u v min r m i 1 n u a i v b i with r being pairs of elements of the two series and m the number of observations a measure commonly used to estimate dependency between hydrological series is the pearson product moment correlation coefficient it can also be used as a distance measure when trying to group series with respect to the degree of their linear relationship to turn the correlation coefficient ρ into a dissimilarity measure d cor the following formulation is generally used a 3 d cor u v 2 1 ρ u i v i in similarity search within group homogeneity can also be understood as how well one hydrograph can be expressed by another within the same group this corresponds to the goodness of fit between modelled and observed time series in hydrological models which is often assessed with the nash sutcliff efficiency nse and has previously been applied in groundwater jackson et al 2016 this has been implemented as a distance measure as well as was implemented as a distance measure a 4 d nse u v nse u i v i 1 another common measure for model efficiency is the kling gupta efficiency gupta et al 2009 which decomposes the sum of squares into three components for bias variation and correlation the aggregate kge was implemented as a distance measure a 5 d kge u v kge u i v i 1 three distance measures were included that do not measure dissimilarity in the time domain but in autocorrelation frequency and wavelet domain the implementations given by the tsclust package in r were applied montero and vilar 2014 the autocorrelation based dissimilarity d acf with a max lag of 5 years is defined as the euclidean distance between autocorrelation series compare eq a 1 the periodogram based distance measure d per is computed in an equal manner with euclidean distance periodograms are estimated using fast fourier transform by base functions in r r development core team 2017 the discrete wavelet transform based distance measure d dwt is computed by first extracting wavelet approximation coefficients with low redundancy in an unsupervised manner of both series subsequently the euclidean distance is calculated between the series coefficients when referring to methods in the manuscript using the above distance measures only the index such as nse in d nse is used pca transformation an additional approach was tested in this study which is based on transformations with pca the method aims to describe the major part of the total variation in a dataset of correlated variables x x 1 x q by a set of uncorrelated principal components pcs y y 1 y q this is done by eigenvalue decomposition of the dataset s correlation matrix transforming the variables into a lower dimensional space two different approaches were then followed i estimating dissimilarity between loadings with the correlation based pca cor or euclidean distance pca eucl and subsequent hierarchical clustering as well as ii applying varimax rotation kaiser 1958 to the pc loadings pca varimax this is done to maximise the sum of the variances of the squared loadings making the matching of groundwater hydrographs to classes possible cluster analysis in hierarchical clustering hca a hierarchy of clusters is constructed either in a top down divisive or a bottom up agglomerative fashion one of the major advantages of hca is that the final number of clusters does not have to be predefined but can be derived from the clustering result ratanamahatana et al 2010 in this study the more commonly used and computationally less expensive agglomerative clustering rui and wunsch 2005 is applied each object starts out as a cluster of its own and is then merged into larger clusters until the desired number is obtained in both methods clusters are split or merged according to some distance measure as well as based on what provides the largest between group dissimilarity three different algorithms for merging objects into clusters were used in this study i complete linkage uses the pair of observations with maximum distance between them as the cluster cluster distance also called furthest neighbour technique ii average linkage calculates the averages of the distances at each step of the joined cluster and the remaining objects and iii ward linkage selects clusters by minimising the error sum of squares between objects in a cluster at each step rui and wunsch 2005 provide more detailed information k means clustering is a partitioning method that minimises the sum of squared errors within each cluster and is therefore implicitly based on pairwise euclidean distance it is designed for minimising variance and works best for low dimensional spaces sun et al 2012 the number of clusters must be predefined and the number of inter cluster objects roughly the same size ratanamahatana et al 2010 the above mentioned properties make the method appear less useful for the task but it has previously successfully been employed in groundwater hydrograph clustering bloomfield et al 2015 appendix b supplementary data supplementary data associated with this article can

7382,changes in the extent and amount of snow cover in eurasia are of great interest because of their vital impacts on the global climate system and regional water resource management this study investigated the spatial and temporal variability of the snow cover extent sce and snow water equivalent swe of the continental eurasia using the northern hemisphere equal area scalable earth grid ease grid weekly sce data for 1972 2006 and the global monthly ease grid swe data for 1979 2004 the results indicated that in general the spatial extent of snow cover significantly decreased during spring and summer but varied little during autumn and winter over eurasia in the study period the date at which snow cover began to disappear in spring has significantly advanced whereas the timing of snow cover onset in autumn did not vary significantly during 1972 2006 the snow cover persistence period declined significantly in the western tibetan plateau as well as partial area of central asia and northwestern russia but varied little in other parts of eurasia snow free breaks sfbs with intermittent snow cover in the cold season were principally observed in the tibetan plateau and central asia causing a low sensitivity of snow cover persistence period to the timings of snow cover onset and disappearance over the areas with shallow snow the averaged sfbs were 1 14 weeks during the study period and the maximum intermittence could even reach 25 weeks in certain years at a seasonal scale swe usually peaked in february or march but fell gradually since april across eurasia both annual mean and annual maximum swe decreased significantly during 1979 2004 in most parts of eurasia except for eastern siberia as well as northwestern and northeastern china the possible cross platform inconsistencies between two passive microwave radiometers may cause uncertainties in the detected trends of swe here suggesting an urgent need of producing a long term more homogeneous swe product in future keywords eurasia snow cover fraction snow cover phenology snow cover persistence period snow free breaks snow water equivalent 1 introduction changes in the extent and amount of eurasian snow cover are of great interest in the context of anthropogenic climate change because of their impact on both human societies and natural ecosystems cohen et al 2014a grippa et al 2005 najafi et al 2016 yeo et al 2017 both observation and simulation based studies have illustrated the importance of eurasian snow cover to regional and global climate systems barnett et al 1989 cohen et al 2014b gong et al 2003 liu and yanai 2001 saito and cohen 2003 wu et al 2014 for example the variability in october eurasian snow cover extent sce affects boreal wintertime conditions over the northern hemisphere via a dynamical pathway involving the stratosphere and changes in the surface based arctic oscillation allen and zender 2011 cohen et al 2014a yeo et al 2017 cohen et al 2014b suggested that high sce in october across eurasia favors the building of high sea level pressure across the northern eurasia from early november through mid december enhancing the poleward heat flux in the lower stratosphere peings et al 2013 demonstrated that the positive negative snow anomalies during 1976 2010 over siberia played a key role in the eastward westward phase of the quasi biennial oscillation in the equatorial stratosphere the sce over eurasia has gradually declined in last few decades brown and robinson 2011 déry and brown 2007 najafi et al 2016 in accordance with the arctic amplification cohen et al 2014a serreze et al 2009 which represents the strongest and the most rapid warming in northern hemisphere high latitudes relative to the globe as a whole however the response of snow cover persistence period onset and disappearing timings to the warming remains controversial on the one hand using the meteorological stations measured snow information peng et al 2013 identified that 70 of the eurasian sites showed a trend towards an earlier end date of snow cover during 1980 2006 while the onset timing of snow cover appeared to become later leading to an overall decrease of snow cover duration this is supported by yu et al 2017 who reported that the number of snow cover days has decreased by 4 72 from 1970 to 2013 over siberia rikiishi and nakasato 2006 also suggested that the snow cover persistence period has declined at all elevations of tibetan plateau during 1966 2011 on the other hand groisman et al 2006 identified an increase in the duration of the period with snow on the ground in russia during 1936 2004 qin et al 2006 also noted a significant increasing trend of annual number of snow covered days over the tibetan plateau from 1957 to 1998 ye and ellison 2003 found that during 1937 1994 the length of continuous snow cover increased to some extent in the northern eurasia but decrease of duration of continuous snow cover was indeed true in the southern siberia while the different snow datasets used in previous studies as well as the spatial heterogeneity of snow cover may partially explain above different findings one should realize that the definition of the snow cover duration based on the first and last dates of seasonal snow cover that does not account for snow free breaks sfbs i e the intermittent snow free conditions that may occur before the last observed snow cover week in spring or after the first observed snow cover week in autumn dye 2002 rikiishi and nakasato 2006 may also plays a key role in accurately detecting the trend of snow cover persistence period during past few decades numerous studies have linked the snow cover variability to the changes of air temperature brown and robinson 2011 foster et al 1983 mccabe and wolock 2009 peng et al 2013 yeo et al 2017 peng et al 2013 demonstrated that the trends of snow cover phenology are primarily associated with the local temperature trends they also quantified that the sensitivity of spring autumn temperature to the end onset date of snow is 0 077 0 068 c d in the northern hemisphere brown and robinson 2011 indicated that the decrease of spring sce in eurasia was mainly driven by warming of air temperature which have significantly increased with rates of 0 6 and 0 36 c 10 yr in march and april during 1970 2010 respectively however based on climate model simulations using future climate scenarios musselman et al 2017 argued that the fraction of meltwater volume produced at high snowmelt rates would be dramatically reduced in a warmer climate over western north america due to a contraction of the snowmelt season to a period of relatively lower available energy it is therefore important to investigate the effect of climate warming on snow cover by examining not only the changes in sce but also snow cover persistence period previous studies have indicated that the air temperature in 20th century is marked by two distinct warming periods 1910 1940 and 1970 2000 euskirchen et al 2007 wang et al 2017a in particular air temperature during the latter period significantly increased with a rate of more than 0 035 c yr between 50 n and 75 n euskirchen et al 2007 it should be noted that however the global land surface temperature has remained relatively flat since early 2000s referred to as warming hiatus guan et al 2015 kosaka and xie 2013 in this regard an accurate investigation on the spatiotemporal variability of not only sce but also its persistence period onset and disappearing times during such an obvious warming period i e 1970s 2000s over eurasia is highly needed traditionally snow properties have been deduced by data measured at ground points in general point measurements of snow are high quality data representative of a small fetch e g 20 m2 see kinar and pomeroy 2015 for an exhaustive review on the ground measurements of snow properties to monitor the snow cover in a temporally and spatially comprehensive manner however optimum interpolation of the point measurements must be undertaken in this way the possible discrepancy of spatial representativeness of local measurements for a relatively larger grid may cause considerable uncertainties atkinson and kelly 1997 clark et al 2011 in particular the spatial density of snow properties measurements in most parts of the world is rather low molotch and bales 2005 demonstrated that for example the snow telemetry network snow water equivalent swe data are usually unrepresentative of the mean grid element swe in the western united states while a wide range of land surface models have been extensively employed to simulate snow processes including sce snow depth and swe across multiple spatial and temporal scales chen et al 2014 ma et al 2017 the skill of such models depends primarily on the accuracy of the input parameter values and atmospheric forcings a challenge for high elevation and high latitude regions because of their inclement environment zhang et al 2015 additionally the real physics of the snow processes are yet far more complicated than we can currently represent numerically for example noah ek et al 2003 one of land surface models used to produce the near real time snow information in the global land data assimilation system rodell et al 2004 often overestimates snow mass and the length of snow season in most boreal regions because of the greater thermal inertia of the combined snow vegetation and soil layer niu et al 2011 yang et al 2011 satellite earth observation is the only way to collect globally consistent data regularly especially as many snow affected regions are sparsely populated advances in satellite observation which cover wide swaths and can provide rapid repeat global coverage are ideally suited for augmenting global snow measurements and are spatially integrated for complete coverage across snow covered areas of the northern hemisphere dietz et al 2012 dozier and painter 2004 reliable estimates of snow cover extent from satellite data have been extensively used to not only investigate the long term variations of snow cover at continental and or hemispheric scales brown and robinson 2011 déry and brown 2007 najafi et al 2016 robinson and frei 2000 but also evaluate land surface models ma et al 2017 toure et al 2016 to improve the climate and weather predictions in terms of hydrological modeling applications it is essential to characterize not only where snow cover exists but also how much water is stored in the snowpack a great amount of attention has also focused on the variability of hydrologically significant snow variables such as snow depth and swe clark et al 2011 clifford 2010 liu et al 2018 sturm et al 2010 roesch 2006 has noted that it is necessary to validate snow mass and sce data separately because the relationship between swe and the snow cover fraction scf on the ground surface is highly nonlinear composite swe patterns at different temporal resolutions and time periods capture different characteristics of the seasonal snow conditions changes in the snow mass can substantially alter soil water status because of its effects on both hydrological and energy cycles barnett et al 1989 blankinship et al 2014 sugimoto et al 2003 furthermore positive swe anomalies enhance freshwater discharge especially in high latitude and high elevation river basins where snowmelt contributes as much as 80 of the annual streamflow barnett et al 2005 kinar and pomeroy 2015 mcnamara et al 1998 jenicek et al 2016 found that for example even the summer low flow was significantly sensitive to any winter and spring swe changes in the alpine catchments of switzerland precise swe information can also improve the skill of streamflow models thereby facilitating an accurate water yield forecast throughout the year koster et al 2010 in this regard an accurate documentation of how swe varies in a warming climate is not only vital to understanding how regional hydrological cycle responses to climate change but also critical for sustainable water resource management using the national snow and ice data center nsidc equal area scalable earth grid ease grid weekly sce product during september 1979 june 2007 and monthly swe product during january 1979 may 2005 the objectives of the present study are 1 elucidating the spatiotemporal variability of snow cover persistence period onset and disappearing timings and swe over eurasia and its four suregions 2 quantifying the interannual variations of annual and seasonal snow cover fraction scf and 3 examining the spatial pattern of snow free breaks in the cold season and its effects on the snow cover persistence period note that any snow data after mid 2000s was deliberately excluded in the present analysis since we only focused on the aforementioned period with a significant warming in the past few decades 2 materials and methods 2 1 nsidc ease grid weekly sce and monthly swe data we used the northern hemisphere 25 km ease grid weekly snow cover and sea ice extent product version 3 1 which contains the snow cover extent at weekly intervals for 3 october 1966 to 24 june 2007 armstrong and brodzik 2005 in the period of october 1966 to june 1999 the snow cover extent was estimated by visually assessing the satellite shortwave imagery robinson and frei 2000 from june 1999 to the present the manual approach was replaced by the national ice center daily interactive multisensor snow and ice mapping system helfrich et al 2007 which combines the visible satellite imagery station observations and passive microwave data to improve snow monitoring during cloudy days the snow cover extent is regridded to an equal area grid of 25 km for the ease grid product each grid cell was flagged as snow covered if more than 50 of its area had visible snow cover otherwise it was categorized as snow free in this regard the scattered snowpacks or patches of snow cover may be overlooked more information about the data processing and quality control procedures is available online at http nsidc org data nsidc 0046 html some gaps occur in the northern hemisphere ease grid weekly snow cover data i e 4 weeks from 1 to 28 july 1968 21 weeks from 2 june 26 october 1969 and 12 weeks from 5 july 26 september 1971 we therefore only used snow cover data for the period from september 1972 to june 2007 we also used the global monthly ease grid snow water equivalent product version 1 armstrong et al 2005 which is the only available long term global swe product based entirely on satellite observations clifford 2010 monthly average swe is calculated from interpolated daily swe which is derived from horizontally polarized difference algorithm of chang et al 1987 with the inputs of daily brightness temperatures measured by passive microwave pmw radiometers including scanning multichannel microwave radiometer smmr before july 1987 and selected special sensor microwave imagers ssm i after august 1987 in particular the possible bias in producing such swe data due to forest cover was corrected using a method proposed by chang et al 1996 the swe data are also gridded onto northern and southern hemisphere 25 km ease grids note that the northern hemisphere swe data are enhanced with snow cover frequencies derived from above mentioned northern hemisphere ease grid weekly sce data more information about this dataset is available online at http nsidc org data nsidc 0271 html the monthly swe data used in the present study is from january 1979 to may 2005 it should be noted that nsidc ease grid weekly sce product is not the only satellite derived product that can be used to investigate large scale variability in snow cover in addition the smmr and ssm i derived swe data used in this study are not the only global swe product a variety of sensors such as moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer and système probatoire d observation de la terre have been well developed to produce snow information with relatively higher spatial resolution dozier and painter 2004 brown et al 2007 for example modis is able to provide sce information with a spatial resolution of 500 m at multiple temporal scales e g 1 d 8 d and monthly riggers and hall 2016 in addition to frequent cloud obstruction and snow misclassification dong and menzel 2016 the temporal coverage of modis snow products only starts in 2000 which is insufficient for examining the long term snow cover variability such a concern is also true for the swe product derived from another pmw radiometer the advanced microwave scanning radiometer earth observing system kelly et al 2003 which is only available from 2002 to 2011 although the nsidc ease grid weekly sce product may be less accurate in highly vegetated and or mountainous areas they are the longest available consistent record of continental scale variations in snow cover extent najafi et al 2016 and are considered to be sufficiently accurate for investigating the continental scale for monitoring snow cover variability brown 2000 déry and brown 2007 dye 2002 the impact of snow cover changes on streamflow yang et al 2007 and validation of climate model performance frei et al 2003 besides the nsidc monthly ease grid swe product used in the present study is the only available long term global swe product based entirely on satellite observations clifford 2010 which is appropriate for scrutinizing the multidecadal variability of swe 2 2 reliability and potential uncertainties in weekly sce and monthly swe data wu and kirtman 2007 investigated the reliability of ease grid weekly sce data by examining the local correlation between the number of days of snow cover and snow depth observed at the stations in siberia demonstrating the correlations between the snow cover and snow depth may depend on the season as evidenced by the similar seasonal and spatial dependence of the correlation coefficients the correlation for the tibetan plateau reached 0 5 in february and 0 7 in april indicating that ease grid weekly sce data are reliable even in this irregular snow cover region wu and kirtman 2007 with the help of the historical soviet daily snow depth dataset peings et al 2013 also assessed the accuracy of nsidc ease grid weekly sce data as well as the reconstructed 20th century reanalysis sce data during 1972 1994 reporting that both snow products show well agreement with the ground based observations derksen et al 2003 compared ssm i derived 25 km ease grid swe data with the surface swe estimates from stations in central north america suggesting that the former agrees well with the latter since the differences between these two are usually less than 15 mm hancock et al 2013 assessed three global swe products including ssm i amsr e and globsnow using the weather station observed snow depth data in finland and they found that these three products overall agree with each other as long as the peak swe was below 100 mm koenig and forster 2004 also demonstrated using the ground measured swe results as a reference that the chang algorithm based swe derived from the ssm i brightness temperature was within 30 mm of the spatially averaged swe for the kuparuk river watershed in alaska while satellite observed sce is usually considered reliable brown 2000 déry and brown 2007 frei et al 2003 hancock et al 2013 the swe may be problematic in some cases the chang algorithm chang et al 1987 the basis for deriving swe data with the pmw radiometer observed brightness temperature has also been shown to saturate in areas of relatively deep snow cover because the higher frequency microwaves no longer decrease with increasing swe derksen et al 2010 in this way the accuracy may be reduced to some extent in areas covered by very deep snow hancock et al 2013 another issue stems from the snowpack properties e g snow bulk density and grain size which play a vital role in the passive microwave estimates of swe dietz et al 2012 dozier and painter 2004 for example ssm i derived swe assumes a fixed value of 0 35 mm for the grain size however the snow grain size may increase with a relatively high temperature gradient across the snow pack hancock et al 2013 leading to potential errors in the estimated swe in different seasons in brief although a comprehensive evaluation of the monthly ease grid swe data using ground measured snow information is beyond the scope of the present study the possible uncertainties in such a pmw radiometer derived swe product caused by biases of either algorithms that relate satellite observed raw signals to physical properties of the snow pack or by the parameters employed cannot be neglected 2 3 snow cover persistence period and snow free breaks we examined the onset and disappearance timings of snow cover as well as the snow cover persistence period for each ease grid weekly totals of the snow covered grid cells were counted for the study region annual seasonal mean numbers of snow covered grids were also calculated for the five categories i e the region as a whole and the four subregions see section 3 1 similar to the water year approach we defined the snow year as starting on 1 september and ending on 31 august of the ensuing year in the present study so for example the snow year of 1972 represents the period from september 1 1972 to august 31 1973 for each snow year the timing of the onset of snow cover was defined as the first week when snow cover was initially observed to exist for two continuous weeks and the timing of the disappearance of snow cover was defined as the last week when snow cover was lastly observed to exist for two continuous weeks the interval between snow cover onset and disappearance timings was defined as the cold season when snowfall likely occurs the snow cover persistence period was defined as the total number of weeks with snow cover during the cold season such a definition of the snow cover persistence period considers the intermittent snow free conditions i e snow free episodes that may occur before the last observed snow cover week in spring or after the first observed snow cover week in autumn note that the length of snow cover persistence period can differ from that of the cold season obviously the difference between the two lengths represents the number of days without snow cover during a cold season or a measure of the intermittency of seasonal snow cover for simplicity this was defined as the snow free breaks during a cold season in the present study to investigate the variations of seasonal snow cover we applied a linear fitting method to the 35 year time series of the annual mean number of snow covered grid cells the length of snow cover persistence period and the onset and disappearance timings of snow cover assuming that the linear trends were independent of variations on smaller time scales linear fitting was applied not only to the time series of snow cover for the five categories but also to those for individual ease grid cells in the latter case we only included the cells showing snow cover for more than 27 of 35 seasons to ensure statistical reliability the statistical method for swe was similar to that for snow cover except that the study period of the former was only from january 1979 to may 2005 3 results 3 1 spatial pattern of snow cover persistence period and swe fig 1 presents the mean snow cover persistence period in weeks over eurasia with the average values calculated for the snow year of 1972 2006 spatially the snow cover persistence period clearly exhibited a latitudinal zonal pattern in the region north of 60 n its length was longer than 31 weeks with the exception of a belt in the western area where it ranged from 26 to 30 weeks the most intensive spatial variability was found in the region of 40 60 n for which snow persistence period obviously declined with the decrease of latitude from ca 30 weeks in the north to less than 5 weeks in the south for example the snow cover persistence period was often less than 5 weeks over the taklimakan and badain jaran deserts of china it appears that however the elevational variation of the snow cover persistence period was surprisingly pronounced between 20 and 40 n which was characterized by an uneven geographical distribution due to the varying snow cover in asia s high mountains this is especially true in the high mountain asia where for example the snow cover persistence period in the karakoram ranges and the western himalayas 40 weeks was much longer than that in the central himalayas 20 25 weeks the snow cover persistence period was roughly 5 10 weeks over the most parts of inner tibetan plateau fig 2 illustrates the spatial pattern of multiyear 1979 2005 mean january february march and april swe across eurasia the swe was also unevenly distributed geographically for a given month in general the swe of higher latitude areas always seemed greater than that of lower latitudes unlike the snow cover persistence period fig 1 however obvious differences of swe were observed between the western and the eastern siberia the latter often shows a maximum swe when compared with other parts of eurasia at a monthly scale one can see that swe values of february and march tended to be higher than those of january in most parts of northern eurasia followed by april when snow gradually melts while a few previous studies have analyzed average snow cover over all of eurasia as an index to address the relationship between eurasian snow cover and other hydrological processes e g yang and xu 1994 the snow anomalies often exhibit opposite results when the western and the eastern eurasia are compared clifford 2010 dash et al 2005 fasullo 2004 we therefore argue that it is not appropriate to use snow cover of the entire eurasian region as a single index based on the above analyses of the spatial patterns of snow cover we recognized an overall latitudinal zonal pattern between 40 80 n as well as a general elevational rule between 20 40 n for the snow cover persistence period in addition the eastern and the western siberia should be treated separately because of their remarkable differences in swe fig 2 in this study therefore we divided the target region into the following four subregions to reflect the spatial difference of snow characteristics i e subregion iw 60 80 n 30 120 e subregion ie 60 80 n 120 180 e subregion ii 40 60 n 30 180 e and subregion iii 20 40 n 30 180 e see fig 1 in this way the first two subregions represent the general conditions of western and eastern siberia respectively the last subregion as mentioned above has different factors that were used in determining snow cover persistence period when compared with others 3 2 seasonality of snow cover fraction and swe having a regular annual cycle of sce is preferred for agricultural practices and ecological balance dramatic changes in the timing of sce such as late or early spring snowmelt and ill timed peak coverage may lead to extreme hydrological events and adverse effects to water resource management in downstream areas since the area of each subregion and the entire region of eurasia are different it is not proper to compare the sce for different subregions directly therefore we used a standardized proxy scf in the remaining text to show the variability in sce simply scf is the ratio of snow covered area to the total area of a subregion or all of eurasia fig 3 a plots the multiyear mean september 1972 to june 2007 annual cycle of scf averaged over four subregions as well as for all of eurasia evident seasonal variations in scf were observed across the entire eurasian continent with higher values in winter and lower values in summer overall eurasian scf peaks in january with maximum values of ca 60 from early october to late april snow covered more than 25 of total area of eurasia with regard to the four subregions the seasonal variations of scf depended on the corresponding locations and varied by subregion in eastern subregion ie and western subregion iw siberia averaged scfs remain larger than 60 in all seasons except summer with a value of 100 lasting approximately 6 7 months in a year the maximum scf over subregion ii was roughly 88 in february followed by a steady decline until july while the extent of snow cover in the tibetan plateau is expected to be very widespread during cold seasons snow seldom falls in southeastern china and southern asia leading to a lowest scf in subregion iii of which weekly values were even less than 20 in winter the multiyear mean january 1979 to may 2005 seasonal variation of swe in fig 3b demonstrates that snow usually begins accumulating in november growing in depth until peaking in february or march after which swe falls rapidly in april across eurasia the late peak and short ablation duration lead to spring droughts and are beneficial to people living in the region in some winters the peak was delayed by about 1 month whereas in other winters the peak appeared earlier by two weeks broad peaks last for 10 weeks whereas sharp peaks last for only 4 weeks the peak snow amount also varied markedly the peak amounts of snow storage between heavy and light snow winters differed by 68 41 51 and 24 mm in subregions iw ie ii and iii respectively the highly variable nature of annual cycles was principally responsible for the anomalies in spring runoff as well as for the seasonality of river flow in the region note that the annual pattern of swe for subregion iii differed from those for the other subregions fig 3b a good example of this is in the tibetan plateau where the snow season normally begins in mid september the swe grew rapidly in the first half of winter with the maximum coverage occurring in february a very slow decline in swe followed until june because of the generally low temperature a long snow season early snow peak rapid increase in snow depth and slow snowmelt were evident in this area of all snow seasons winter december february djf had the largest snow storage accounting for 45 2 of the annual snow storage spring march may mam and autumn september november son occupied 28 0 and 21 2 of the annual snow storage respectively 3 3 interannual variations of snow cover fraction normalized year to year variations of scf were rather low in winter whereas the normalized variability increased toward spring and peaked in autumn when only remnants of snow are left in siberia figs 3a and 4 this finding is reasonable because the winter snowpack was quite stable in most parts of the northern eurasia where temperatures remained below the freezing point for all subregions the scf with the greatest interannual variability occurred in autumn son fig 4 c this was especially true for subregions iw and ie of which the largest anomaly reached 15 in both positive and negative directions fig 4c during the snow ablation season mam scf has relatively lower interannual variability compared with son figs 3a and 4b note that in summer and autumn when the subregional mean scfs are normally low the normalized standard deviations may be less reliable because moderate variations in total scf may drastically change the normalized variations while the annual mean scf for the present study period did not show a significant declining trend over the whole of eurasia table 1 it decreased significantly over subregions iw and iii with rates of 0 8 10 yr and 0 5 10 yr respectively in the maximum snow season djf the extent of snow cover in all subregions changed little during the entire period of 1972 2006 in particular scf during djf in the subregions i and ii were almost 100 in all years because of their high latitudes the scf in the summer june august jja shrunk significantly in all subregions except in eastern siberia in particular the scf in jja fell significantly at rates of 1 8 10 yr and 0 9 10 yr in subregions iw and iii respectively leading to a significant decline 0 8 10 yr of summer scf over all of eurasia during the study period similarly the scf in the snow ablation season mam also declined in every subregion although such decreasing trends were not significant except in subregion iii during the snow accumulation season son the scf showed slight decreasing trends in all subregions except in eastern siberia 3 4 interannual variations of the onset disappearance timing and persistence period of snow cover fig 5 provides details related to the spatial heterogeneity of the trends of snow cover onset and time of disappearance as well as the snow cover persistence period across eurasia during 1972 2006 derived from weekly ease grid sce data note again that the trends are given in the unit of week 10 yr basically a positive trend of the onset timings dominated in the southern tibetan plateau but it varied little over siberia negative disappearance timing trend was common across the continent and particularly concentrated in western siberia central asia tibetan plateau mongolia and the northern border of the eurasian continent the snow cover persistence period decreased significantly in the western tibetan plateau and southern part of central asia with a rates of approximately 2 week 10 yr and in parts of northwestern russia with a rates of about 1 2 week 10 yr however snow cover persistence period increased slightly in a belt between 110 and 140 e in terms of the entire region of eurasia more than 60 of all grids showed a declining trend in the snow cover persistence period which is consistent with the overall negative trend of entire regional mean snow cover persistence period see table 2 the anomaly time series of the snow cover onset timing disappearance timing and persistence period from 1972 to 2006 across each subregion and the entire eurasian continent are depicted in the fig 6 along with corresponding trends illustrated in table 2 with regard to the whole eurasia where snow cover has started to appear a little later and terminated significantly earlier the snow cover persistence period showed a slight decreasing trend during 1972 2006 the timing of the occurrence of snow cover in autumn in both subregions iw and ie became slightly earlier during 1972 2006 as can be seen their negative trends the timing of the disappearance of snow cover however also became earlier in these two regions with trends of 0 49 and 0 28 week 10 yr respectively as a result the snow cover persistence period only showed slight decreasing trends with rates of 0 33 and 0 08 week 10 yr for subregions iw and ie respectively subregions ii and iii varied by similar phases the snow cover started later i e slight and significant positive trends for onset timing of subregions ii and iii respectively but disappeared significantly earlier i e significant negative trends for the time of disappearance this resulted in slightly shortened length for the snow cover persistence period from 1972 to 2006 with trends of 0 18 and 0 16 week 10 yr respectively to summarize the timing of the onset of snow cover varied little except for a significant delay in subregion iii while the timing of the disappearance of snow cover significantly decreased in the majority of subregions except for in subregion ie table 2 3 5 interannual variations of swe to investigate the interannual variability in mean swe over the study domain a snow cover area weighted monthly mean swe was computed over the grid domain normalized time series of mean swe for winter spring and autumn and the annual series which was averaged over all subregions and the whole of eurasia are shown in fig 7 at a regional scale both annual mean and seasonal mean swe across eurasia showed significant decreasing trends during 1979 2004 table 3 regarding to the four subregions the annual mean swe declined significantly in all subregions except in eastern siberia subregion ie similarly winter spring and autumn mean swe also fell significantly in these three subregions the swe in subregion ie varied little in all seasons except spring where it significantly declined at a rate of 5 7 mm 10 yr during the study period table 3 generally stable accumulations are suggested by the swe time series in autumn with a low interannual variability however dramatic heterogeneity of snowmelt both temporally and spatially is suggested by the time series in spring of four subregions fig 7 in general the winter and spring swe have similar trends to the annual swe because of large contribution of the former to the annual values one of the most useful variables for assessing water availability is annual maximum swe or the amount of water that would be obtained by melting of the accumulated snow jenicek et al 2016 water resource managers can estimate the water available for use in spring by the swe of a given season such information is also vital for emergency managers involved in assessing the potential for snow melt induced floods furthermore long term records of swe are also useful to architects and civil engineers trying to determine snow load standards for structures fig 8 shows the spatial pattern of the trends of annual maximum swe during 1979 2004 specifically positive trends extended widely over eastern siberia as well as northwestern and northeastern china and also in part of central asia whereas negative trends dominated in western siberia the trends of maximum swe were generally spatially heterogeneous in the mid latitude region subregion ii ranging from 2 to 2 mm 10 yr these trends must be considered in the context of their representativeness of interannual changes fig 9 shows that the anomalies of annual maximum swe averaged in every subregion and the whole of eurasia one can see that subregion iw had a most obvious interannual variability of annual maximum swe leading to possibly remarkable interannual variations of water resources in spring over the western siberia 4 discussions 4 1 comparisons with previous studies this study examined the temporal and spatial variability in the snow cover extent sce and snow water equivalent swe in the continental eurasia as a whole and as divided into four subregions the investigation was based on quantitative analyses of satellite observed ease grid weekly sce data and monthly swe data we found a significantly decreasing trend in snow covered areas during spring and summer while snow covered areas varied little or even increased slightly during winter and autumn from 1972 to 2006 over the entire scale of eurasia which agreed with the findings of déry and brown 2007 and robinson and frei 2000 brown 2000 found that significant sce shrinking in april over the western eurasia represents a decrease in mean snow cover in excess of 20 during 1922 1997 brown and robinson 2011 further suggested that the declines in march and april sce over northern hemisphere during the period of 1970 2010 equaled to a 7 and 11 decrease in those of pre 1970s values respectively mccabe and wolock 2009 attributed the significant decrease of march sce since 1970 to the substantial increase of winter temperatures over northern hemisphere yeo et al 2017 suggested that the decreased sce over the eurasia during spring is predominantly attributed to the warm air temperature anomalies while the increased sce in october was due to the loss of arctic sea ice and the ensuing moisture transport to the atmosphere in general the date when spring snow cover began to disappear in eurasia advanced significantly from 1972 to 2006 while only slightly negative trends were observed for the onset of snow cover in the two highest latitude subregions i e subregions iw and ie mostly above 60 n the snow cover in other two subregions with relatively low latitudes was starting later during the study period in particular subregion iii showed a significantly positive trend of the onset snow cover with a rate of 0 69 week 10 yr these results were generally consistent with an analysis employing the records of meteorological stations by peng et al 2013 who suggested that the termination onset date of snow cover has advanced delayed by 2 6 5 6 d decade 1 3 4 9 d decade during 1980 2006 across eurasia consistent with previous studies that indicated an increase in the snow free period caused by climatic warming maxwell 1992 dye 2002 we found overall shortening trends for the snow cover persistence period in eurasia during 1972 2006 table 2 however such trends were only significant in the southern part of central asia the western tibetan plateau and parts of northwestern russia the results of the present study were generally consistent with han et al 2014 who also identified a significant decrease in the duration of the snow cover over the tibetan plateau using the pmw radiometer derived snow cover data similarly rikiishi and nakasato 2006 quantified that the length of a snow cover season was generally decreasing at rates of 0 2 0 4 week yr in the karakoram ranges and 0 0 2 week yr in the tibetan plateau during 1966 2011 dye 2002 also demonstrated that the duration of the snow free days in northern hemisphere has increased by ca 3 6 d decade during 1972 2000 principally as a result of earlier snow cover disappearance in spring because the sce data used in the present study has only weekly values it may be not able to capture the fast snow accumulation ablation processes under abrupt weather conditions that is the relatively low temporal resolution of sce product may impact the accuracy of the snow cover persistence period shown here though such a concern may be only true occasionally in certain areas we believe that future data with improved temporal and or spatial resolutions would be of help for comprehensive monitoring the variability of snow cover persistence period in a changing climate overall swe showed highest values in the eastern siberia but it decreased both southward and westward because swe data is essentially derived from the estimated snow depth using the satellite observed brightness temperature chang et al 1987 the variations in snow depth based on station observations show features similar to those of the swe qin et al 2006 wu and kirtman 2007 note that the decreasing trends of swe during 1979 2004 found in the present study may bear some uncertainties since this swe product is derived from smmr and ssm i for the periods of 1979 1987 and 1987 2005 respectively inevitably the different spatial temporal and radiometric resolutions between these two pmw radiometers may cause potential inconsistencies which are critical for characterizing the long term variability in swe clifford 2010 a previous consistency assessment using observations during summer suggested that ssm i brightness temperatures might systematically exceed smmr measurements over north america derksen et al 2003 however the lack of a direct overlap in winter between the two sensors makes it difficult to determine whether such differences are caused by the internal variations of swe in a changing climate or by cross platform inconsistencies we believe that if more adjustments that are more sophisticated were used to produce a more consistent brightness temperature time series this could remedy such a possible deficiency so this topic deserves further study in future 4 2 effects of cold season snow free breaks on the snow cover persistence period we found significantly negative correlations between the length of snow cover persistence period and the timing of the onset of snow cover in a majority of subregions except for subregion iii at the same time the length of snow cover persistence period was significantly and positively correlated with the timing of the disappearance of snow cover in most subregions except for subregion ii fig 10 the slope in each regression equation in fig 10 essentially represents the overall sensitivity of the snow cover persistence period to the timings of the onset disappearance of snow cover in subregions iw and ie the slopes are slightly smaller than 1 due to the short interval between the subregional mean onset timing of snow cover to the timing when scf reached 100 that is also true for the snowmelt process during the spring season in subregions ii and iii however the slopes are much smaller than 1 in particular a 1 week advance of the time of snow disappearance and 1 week delay of the onset only leads to shortening of 0 11 week and 0 02 week of snow cover persistence period for subregion iii respectively fig 10 although the relatively low scf in these two subregions also had an effect in calculating the subregional mean snow cover onset and disappearance timings the possible intermittence of snow cover during the cold season may also play an important role in such a low sensitivity furthermore the sce analysis in table 2 also reveals inconsistent changes between the timings of the onset disappearance of snow cover and its persistence periods in the subregions ii and iii where shallow snow was widely distributed specifically the timings of snow cover onset have delayed to some extent with trends of 0 08 and 0 69 week 10 yr in subregions ii and iii respectively meanwhile the time of snow cover disappearance was starting significantly earlier with trends of 0 47 and 0 88 week 10 yr in the same respective subregions however the snow cover persistence periods were only slightly shortened by 0 18 and 0 16 week 10 yr in subregions ii and iii respectively such an apparent contradiction might be explained by the temporal discontinuity of snow cover possible causes of the temporal discontinuity are sublimation as well as drifting and or fast melting that cause snow cover to be intermittent in a cold season if the snow is not thick enough for example qin et al 2006 suggested that sublimation contributes largely to decreases in the scf during winter and may consume all the snow mass over areas covered by thin snow in western china ye and ellison 2003 attributed this type of a temporal discontinuity to the transitional snowfall season i e the difference between the first last snowfall date and the first last date of continuous ground snow cover and considered it to be present even in northern siberia here we referred to this type of a discontinuity as a snow free break sfb because it may be witnessed in mid cold season fig 11 illustrates the multiyear mean and maximum sfbs across eurasia during 1972 2006 it can be seen that the sfbs mainly occurred south of 50 n and was concentrated in the tibetan plateau and central asia in particular the averaged intermittence of snow cover was 1 14 weeks and could even reach 25 weeks in certain extreme years in the tibetan plateau we believe that such obvious discontinuities of snow cover over the tibetan plateau were a result of the very low amount of precipitation received during winter the winter precipitation with an amount of less than 75 mm averaged for the entire tibetan plateau generally occupies less than 10 of annual total precipitation wang et al 2017b sui et al 2013 the largest sfb e g mean value of 14 weeks appeared in the northwestern part of tibetan plateau in which the lowest precipitation typically occurs the presently observed sfbs are also consistent with basist et al 1996 and armstrong and brodzik 2001 who reported that snow cover in tibetan plateau is often intermittent in spatial distribution specifically they suggested that although roughly 50 of the plateau was being snow covered the single snow covered area hardly exceeded several hundred square kilometers armstrong and brodzik 2001 basist et al 1996 rikiishi and nakasato 2006 also quantified that during approximately 40 of the days of the cold season the ground was not covered by snow in most parts of tibetan plateau 5 conclusions the present study analyzed the spatiotemporal variability of snow cover and snow water equivalent over eurasia using the satellite observed ease grid weekly sce data and monthly swe data from 1972 to 2006 the spatial extent of snow cover during spring and summer has decreased significantly but it varied little during winter and autumn in most parts of eurasia in general during 1972 2006 the date when spring snow cover began to disappear in eurasia has significantly advanced whereas the onset timing of snow cover varied little in most parts of eurasia the multiyear mean snow cover persistence period showed zonal distribution between 40 n and 80 n declining with the decrease in latitude from more than 31 weeks to less than 5 weeks however it became more dependent on the elevation over the high mountain asia over the 35 year study period the length of snow cover persistence period overall declined but such negative trends are only significant in the western tibetan plateau and southern part of central asia with rates of about 2 week 10 yr and in parts of the northwestern of russia with a rate of 1 2 week 10 yr snow free breaks with intermittent snow cover in the mid cold season were mainly observed in the tibetan plateau and central asia with values of 1 14 weeks average during 1972 2006 causing a low sensitivity of the length of snow cover persistence period to the onset and disappearance timings in subregions ii and iii the swe was largest in the eastern siberia and decreased both southward and westward differing from the spatial pattern of snow cover persistence period seasonally swe usually reached the maximum in february or march followed by a gradual decline since april across eurasia both the annual mean and annual maximum swe decreased significantly during 1979 2004 in most parts of eurasia except for eastern siberia as well as northwestern and northeastern china note that the potential inconsistencies between two passive microwave sensors may lead to uncertainties in the detected trend of swe from 1979 to 2004 over eurasia in the present study a wide range of studies have attempted to elucidate the causes of such sce and swe changes however both sce and swe changes do not fully correspond with changes in air temperature which has significantly increased in cold seasons e g mccabe and wolock 2009 yeo et al 2017 you et al 2010 numerous researchers have also demonstrated that atmospheric circulation is the factor indirectly influencing snow cover by acting on radiation temperature and precipitation conditions clark et al 1999 seager et al 2010 more knowledge of atmospheric circulation snow cover

7382,changes in the extent and amount of snow cover in eurasia are of great interest because of their vital impacts on the global climate system and regional water resource management this study investigated the spatial and temporal variability of the snow cover extent sce and snow water equivalent swe of the continental eurasia using the northern hemisphere equal area scalable earth grid ease grid weekly sce data for 1972 2006 and the global monthly ease grid swe data for 1979 2004 the results indicated that in general the spatial extent of snow cover significantly decreased during spring and summer but varied little during autumn and winter over eurasia in the study period the date at which snow cover began to disappear in spring has significantly advanced whereas the timing of snow cover onset in autumn did not vary significantly during 1972 2006 the snow cover persistence period declined significantly in the western tibetan plateau as well as partial area of central asia and northwestern russia but varied little in other parts of eurasia snow free breaks sfbs with intermittent snow cover in the cold season were principally observed in the tibetan plateau and central asia causing a low sensitivity of snow cover persistence period to the timings of snow cover onset and disappearance over the areas with shallow snow the averaged sfbs were 1 14 weeks during the study period and the maximum intermittence could even reach 25 weeks in certain years at a seasonal scale swe usually peaked in february or march but fell gradually since april across eurasia both annual mean and annual maximum swe decreased significantly during 1979 2004 in most parts of eurasia except for eastern siberia as well as northwestern and northeastern china the possible cross platform inconsistencies between two passive microwave radiometers may cause uncertainties in the detected trends of swe here suggesting an urgent need of producing a long term more homogeneous swe product in future keywords eurasia snow cover fraction snow cover phenology snow cover persistence period snow free breaks snow water equivalent 1 introduction changes in the extent and amount of eurasian snow cover are of great interest in the context of anthropogenic climate change because of their impact on both human societies and natural ecosystems cohen et al 2014a grippa et al 2005 najafi et al 2016 yeo et al 2017 both observation and simulation based studies have illustrated the importance of eurasian snow cover to regional and global climate systems barnett et al 1989 cohen et al 2014b gong et al 2003 liu and yanai 2001 saito and cohen 2003 wu et al 2014 for example the variability in october eurasian snow cover extent sce affects boreal wintertime conditions over the northern hemisphere via a dynamical pathway involving the stratosphere and changes in the surface based arctic oscillation allen and zender 2011 cohen et al 2014a yeo et al 2017 cohen et al 2014b suggested that high sce in october across eurasia favors the building of high sea level pressure across the northern eurasia from early november through mid december enhancing the poleward heat flux in the lower stratosphere peings et al 2013 demonstrated that the positive negative snow anomalies during 1976 2010 over siberia played a key role in the eastward westward phase of the quasi biennial oscillation in the equatorial stratosphere the sce over eurasia has gradually declined in last few decades brown and robinson 2011 déry and brown 2007 najafi et al 2016 in accordance with the arctic amplification cohen et al 2014a serreze et al 2009 which represents the strongest and the most rapid warming in northern hemisphere high latitudes relative to the globe as a whole however the response of snow cover persistence period onset and disappearing timings to the warming remains controversial on the one hand using the meteorological stations measured snow information peng et al 2013 identified that 70 of the eurasian sites showed a trend towards an earlier end date of snow cover during 1980 2006 while the onset timing of snow cover appeared to become later leading to an overall decrease of snow cover duration this is supported by yu et al 2017 who reported that the number of snow cover days has decreased by 4 72 from 1970 to 2013 over siberia rikiishi and nakasato 2006 also suggested that the snow cover persistence period has declined at all elevations of tibetan plateau during 1966 2011 on the other hand groisman et al 2006 identified an increase in the duration of the period with snow on the ground in russia during 1936 2004 qin et al 2006 also noted a significant increasing trend of annual number of snow covered days over the tibetan plateau from 1957 to 1998 ye and ellison 2003 found that during 1937 1994 the length of continuous snow cover increased to some extent in the northern eurasia but decrease of duration of continuous snow cover was indeed true in the southern siberia while the different snow datasets used in previous studies as well as the spatial heterogeneity of snow cover may partially explain above different findings one should realize that the definition of the snow cover duration based on the first and last dates of seasonal snow cover that does not account for snow free breaks sfbs i e the intermittent snow free conditions that may occur before the last observed snow cover week in spring or after the first observed snow cover week in autumn dye 2002 rikiishi and nakasato 2006 may also plays a key role in accurately detecting the trend of snow cover persistence period during past few decades numerous studies have linked the snow cover variability to the changes of air temperature brown and robinson 2011 foster et al 1983 mccabe and wolock 2009 peng et al 2013 yeo et al 2017 peng et al 2013 demonstrated that the trends of snow cover phenology are primarily associated with the local temperature trends they also quantified that the sensitivity of spring autumn temperature to the end onset date of snow is 0 077 0 068 c d in the northern hemisphere brown and robinson 2011 indicated that the decrease of spring sce in eurasia was mainly driven by warming of air temperature which have significantly increased with rates of 0 6 and 0 36 c 10 yr in march and april during 1970 2010 respectively however based on climate model simulations using future climate scenarios musselman et al 2017 argued that the fraction of meltwater volume produced at high snowmelt rates would be dramatically reduced in a warmer climate over western north america due to a contraction of the snowmelt season to a period of relatively lower available energy it is therefore important to investigate the effect of climate warming on snow cover by examining not only the changes in sce but also snow cover persistence period previous studies have indicated that the air temperature in 20th century is marked by two distinct warming periods 1910 1940 and 1970 2000 euskirchen et al 2007 wang et al 2017a in particular air temperature during the latter period significantly increased with a rate of more than 0 035 c yr between 50 n and 75 n euskirchen et al 2007 it should be noted that however the global land surface temperature has remained relatively flat since early 2000s referred to as warming hiatus guan et al 2015 kosaka and xie 2013 in this regard an accurate investigation on the spatiotemporal variability of not only sce but also its persistence period onset and disappearing times during such an obvious warming period i e 1970s 2000s over eurasia is highly needed traditionally snow properties have been deduced by data measured at ground points in general point measurements of snow are high quality data representative of a small fetch e g 20 m2 see kinar and pomeroy 2015 for an exhaustive review on the ground measurements of snow properties to monitor the snow cover in a temporally and spatially comprehensive manner however optimum interpolation of the point measurements must be undertaken in this way the possible discrepancy of spatial representativeness of local measurements for a relatively larger grid may cause considerable uncertainties atkinson and kelly 1997 clark et al 2011 in particular the spatial density of snow properties measurements in most parts of the world is rather low molotch and bales 2005 demonstrated that for example the snow telemetry network snow water equivalent swe data are usually unrepresentative of the mean grid element swe in the western united states while a wide range of land surface models have been extensively employed to simulate snow processes including sce snow depth and swe across multiple spatial and temporal scales chen et al 2014 ma et al 2017 the skill of such models depends primarily on the accuracy of the input parameter values and atmospheric forcings a challenge for high elevation and high latitude regions because of their inclement environment zhang et al 2015 additionally the real physics of the snow processes are yet far more complicated than we can currently represent numerically for example noah ek et al 2003 one of land surface models used to produce the near real time snow information in the global land data assimilation system rodell et al 2004 often overestimates snow mass and the length of snow season in most boreal regions because of the greater thermal inertia of the combined snow vegetation and soil layer niu et al 2011 yang et al 2011 satellite earth observation is the only way to collect globally consistent data regularly especially as many snow affected regions are sparsely populated advances in satellite observation which cover wide swaths and can provide rapid repeat global coverage are ideally suited for augmenting global snow measurements and are spatially integrated for complete coverage across snow covered areas of the northern hemisphere dietz et al 2012 dozier and painter 2004 reliable estimates of snow cover extent from satellite data have been extensively used to not only investigate the long term variations of snow cover at continental and or hemispheric scales brown and robinson 2011 déry and brown 2007 najafi et al 2016 robinson and frei 2000 but also evaluate land surface models ma et al 2017 toure et al 2016 to improve the climate and weather predictions in terms of hydrological modeling applications it is essential to characterize not only where snow cover exists but also how much water is stored in the snowpack a great amount of attention has also focused on the variability of hydrologically significant snow variables such as snow depth and swe clark et al 2011 clifford 2010 liu et al 2018 sturm et al 2010 roesch 2006 has noted that it is necessary to validate snow mass and sce data separately because the relationship between swe and the snow cover fraction scf on the ground surface is highly nonlinear composite swe patterns at different temporal resolutions and time periods capture different characteristics of the seasonal snow conditions changes in the snow mass can substantially alter soil water status because of its effects on both hydrological and energy cycles barnett et al 1989 blankinship et al 2014 sugimoto et al 2003 furthermore positive swe anomalies enhance freshwater discharge especially in high latitude and high elevation river basins where snowmelt contributes as much as 80 of the annual streamflow barnett et al 2005 kinar and pomeroy 2015 mcnamara et al 1998 jenicek et al 2016 found that for example even the summer low flow was significantly sensitive to any winter and spring swe changes in the alpine catchments of switzerland precise swe information can also improve the skill of streamflow models thereby facilitating an accurate water yield forecast throughout the year koster et al 2010 in this regard an accurate documentation of how swe varies in a warming climate is not only vital to understanding how regional hydrological cycle responses to climate change but also critical for sustainable water resource management using the national snow and ice data center nsidc equal area scalable earth grid ease grid weekly sce product during september 1979 june 2007 and monthly swe product during january 1979 may 2005 the objectives of the present study are 1 elucidating the spatiotemporal variability of snow cover persistence period onset and disappearing timings and swe over eurasia and its four suregions 2 quantifying the interannual variations of annual and seasonal snow cover fraction scf and 3 examining the spatial pattern of snow free breaks in the cold season and its effects on the snow cover persistence period note that any snow data after mid 2000s was deliberately excluded in the present analysis since we only focused on the aforementioned period with a significant warming in the past few decades 2 materials and methods 2 1 nsidc ease grid weekly sce and monthly swe data we used the northern hemisphere 25 km ease grid weekly snow cover and sea ice extent product version 3 1 which contains the snow cover extent at weekly intervals for 3 october 1966 to 24 june 2007 armstrong and brodzik 2005 in the period of october 1966 to june 1999 the snow cover extent was estimated by visually assessing the satellite shortwave imagery robinson and frei 2000 from june 1999 to the present the manual approach was replaced by the national ice center daily interactive multisensor snow and ice mapping system helfrich et al 2007 which combines the visible satellite imagery station observations and passive microwave data to improve snow monitoring during cloudy days the snow cover extent is regridded to an equal area grid of 25 km for the ease grid product each grid cell was flagged as snow covered if more than 50 of its area had visible snow cover otherwise it was categorized as snow free in this regard the scattered snowpacks or patches of snow cover may be overlooked more information about the data processing and quality control procedures is available online at http nsidc org data nsidc 0046 html some gaps occur in the northern hemisphere ease grid weekly snow cover data i e 4 weeks from 1 to 28 july 1968 21 weeks from 2 june 26 october 1969 and 12 weeks from 5 july 26 september 1971 we therefore only used snow cover data for the period from september 1972 to june 2007 we also used the global monthly ease grid snow water equivalent product version 1 armstrong et al 2005 which is the only available long term global swe product based entirely on satellite observations clifford 2010 monthly average swe is calculated from interpolated daily swe which is derived from horizontally polarized difference algorithm of chang et al 1987 with the inputs of daily brightness temperatures measured by passive microwave pmw radiometers including scanning multichannel microwave radiometer smmr before july 1987 and selected special sensor microwave imagers ssm i after august 1987 in particular the possible bias in producing such swe data due to forest cover was corrected using a method proposed by chang et al 1996 the swe data are also gridded onto northern and southern hemisphere 25 km ease grids note that the northern hemisphere swe data are enhanced with snow cover frequencies derived from above mentioned northern hemisphere ease grid weekly sce data more information about this dataset is available online at http nsidc org data nsidc 0271 html the monthly swe data used in the present study is from january 1979 to may 2005 it should be noted that nsidc ease grid weekly sce product is not the only satellite derived product that can be used to investigate large scale variability in snow cover in addition the smmr and ssm i derived swe data used in this study are not the only global swe product a variety of sensors such as moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer and système probatoire d observation de la terre have been well developed to produce snow information with relatively higher spatial resolution dozier and painter 2004 brown et al 2007 for example modis is able to provide sce information with a spatial resolution of 500 m at multiple temporal scales e g 1 d 8 d and monthly riggers and hall 2016 in addition to frequent cloud obstruction and snow misclassification dong and menzel 2016 the temporal coverage of modis snow products only starts in 2000 which is insufficient for examining the long term snow cover variability such a concern is also true for the swe product derived from another pmw radiometer the advanced microwave scanning radiometer earth observing system kelly et al 2003 which is only available from 2002 to 2011 although the nsidc ease grid weekly sce product may be less accurate in highly vegetated and or mountainous areas they are the longest available consistent record of continental scale variations in snow cover extent najafi et al 2016 and are considered to be sufficiently accurate for investigating the continental scale for monitoring snow cover variability brown 2000 déry and brown 2007 dye 2002 the impact of snow cover changes on streamflow yang et al 2007 and validation of climate model performance frei et al 2003 besides the nsidc monthly ease grid swe product used in the present study is the only available long term global swe product based entirely on satellite observations clifford 2010 which is appropriate for scrutinizing the multidecadal variability of swe 2 2 reliability and potential uncertainties in weekly sce and monthly swe data wu and kirtman 2007 investigated the reliability of ease grid weekly sce data by examining the local correlation between the number of days of snow cover and snow depth observed at the stations in siberia demonstrating the correlations between the snow cover and snow depth may depend on the season as evidenced by the similar seasonal and spatial dependence of the correlation coefficients the correlation for the tibetan plateau reached 0 5 in february and 0 7 in april indicating that ease grid weekly sce data are reliable even in this irregular snow cover region wu and kirtman 2007 with the help of the historical soviet daily snow depth dataset peings et al 2013 also assessed the accuracy of nsidc ease grid weekly sce data as well as the reconstructed 20th century reanalysis sce data during 1972 1994 reporting that both snow products show well agreement with the ground based observations derksen et al 2003 compared ssm i derived 25 km ease grid swe data with the surface swe estimates from stations in central north america suggesting that the former agrees well with the latter since the differences between these two are usually less than 15 mm hancock et al 2013 assessed three global swe products including ssm i amsr e and globsnow using the weather station observed snow depth data in finland and they found that these three products overall agree with each other as long as the peak swe was below 100 mm koenig and forster 2004 also demonstrated using the ground measured swe results as a reference that the chang algorithm based swe derived from the ssm i brightness temperature was within 30 mm of the spatially averaged swe for the kuparuk river watershed in alaska while satellite observed sce is usually considered reliable brown 2000 déry and brown 2007 frei et al 2003 hancock et al 2013 the swe may be problematic in some cases the chang algorithm chang et al 1987 the basis for deriving swe data with the pmw radiometer observed brightness temperature has also been shown to saturate in areas of relatively deep snow cover because the higher frequency microwaves no longer decrease with increasing swe derksen et al 2010 in this way the accuracy may be reduced to some extent in areas covered by very deep snow hancock et al 2013 another issue stems from the snowpack properties e g snow bulk density and grain size which play a vital role in the passive microwave estimates of swe dietz et al 2012 dozier and painter 2004 for example ssm i derived swe assumes a fixed value of 0 35 mm for the grain size however the snow grain size may increase with a relatively high temperature gradient across the snow pack hancock et al 2013 leading to potential errors in the estimated swe in different seasons in brief although a comprehensive evaluation of the monthly ease grid swe data using ground measured snow information is beyond the scope of the present study the possible uncertainties in such a pmw radiometer derived swe product caused by biases of either algorithms that relate satellite observed raw signals to physical properties of the snow pack or by the parameters employed cannot be neglected 2 3 snow cover persistence period and snow free breaks we examined the onset and disappearance timings of snow cover as well as the snow cover persistence period for each ease grid weekly totals of the snow covered grid cells were counted for the study region annual seasonal mean numbers of snow covered grids were also calculated for the five categories i e the region as a whole and the four subregions see section 3 1 similar to the water year approach we defined the snow year as starting on 1 september and ending on 31 august of the ensuing year in the present study so for example the snow year of 1972 represents the period from september 1 1972 to august 31 1973 for each snow year the timing of the onset of snow cover was defined as the first week when snow cover was initially observed to exist for two continuous weeks and the timing of the disappearance of snow cover was defined as the last week when snow cover was lastly observed to exist for two continuous weeks the interval between snow cover onset and disappearance timings was defined as the cold season when snowfall likely occurs the snow cover persistence period was defined as the total number of weeks with snow cover during the cold season such a definition of the snow cover persistence period considers the intermittent snow free conditions i e snow free episodes that may occur before the last observed snow cover week in spring or after the first observed snow cover week in autumn note that the length of snow cover persistence period can differ from that of the cold season obviously the difference between the two lengths represents the number of days without snow cover during a cold season or a measure of the intermittency of seasonal snow cover for simplicity this was defined as the snow free breaks during a cold season in the present study to investigate the variations of seasonal snow cover we applied a linear fitting method to the 35 year time series of the annual mean number of snow covered grid cells the length of snow cover persistence period and the onset and disappearance timings of snow cover assuming that the linear trends were independent of variations on smaller time scales linear fitting was applied not only to the time series of snow cover for the five categories but also to those for individual ease grid cells in the latter case we only included the cells showing snow cover for more than 27 of 35 seasons to ensure statistical reliability the statistical method for swe was similar to that for snow cover except that the study period of the former was only from january 1979 to may 2005 3 results 3 1 spatial pattern of snow cover persistence period and swe fig 1 presents the mean snow cover persistence period in weeks over eurasia with the average values calculated for the snow year of 1972 2006 spatially the snow cover persistence period clearly exhibited a latitudinal zonal pattern in the region north of 60 n its length was longer than 31 weeks with the exception of a belt in the western area where it ranged from 26 to 30 weeks the most intensive spatial variability was found in the region of 40 60 n for which snow persistence period obviously declined with the decrease of latitude from ca 30 weeks in the north to less than 5 weeks in the south for example the snow cover persistence period was often less than 5 weeks over the taklimakan and badain jaran deserts of china it appears that however the elevational variation of the snow cover persistence period was surprisingly pronounced between 20 and 40 n which was characterized by an uneven geographical distribution due to the varying snow cover in asia s high mountains this is especially true in the high mountain asia where for example the snow cover persistence period in the karakoram ranges and the western himalayas 40 weeks was much longer than that in the central himalayas 20 25 weeks the snow cover persistence period was roughly 5 10 weeks over the most parts of inner tibetan plateau fig 2 illustrates the spatial pattern of multiyear 1979 2005 mean january february march and april swe across eurasia the swe was also unevenly distributed geographically for a given month in general the swe of higher latitude areas always seemed greater than that of lower latitudes unlike the snow cover persistence period fig 1 however obvious differences of swe were observed between the western and the eastern siberia the latter often shows a maximum swe when compared with other parts of eurasia at a monthly scale one can see that swe values of february and march tended to be higher than those of january in most parts of northern eurasia followed by april when snow gradually melts while a few previous studies have analyzed average snow cover over all of eurasia as an index to address the relationship between eurasian snow cover and other hydrological processes e g yang and xu 1994 the snow anomalies often exhibit opposite results when the western and the eastern eurasia are compared clifford 2010 dash et al 2005 fasullo 2004 we therefore argue that it is not appropriate to use snow cover of the entire eurasian region as a single index based on the above analyses of the spatial patterns of snow cover we recognized an overall latitudinal zonal pattern between 40 80 n as well as a general elevational rule between 20 40 n for the snow cover persistence period in addition the eastern and the western siberia should be treated separately because of their remarkable differences in swe fig 2 in this study therefore we divided the target region into the following four subregions to reflect the spatial difference of snow characteristics i e subregion iw 60 80 n 30 120 e subregion ie 60 80 n 120 180 e subregion ii 40 60 n 30 180 e and subregion iii 20 40 n 30 180 e see fig 1 in this way the first two subregions represent the general conditions of western and eastern siberia respectively the last subregion as mentioned above has different factors that were used in determining snow cover persistence period when compared with others 3 2 seasonality of snow cover fraction and swe having a regular annual cycle of sce is preferred for agricultural practices and ecological balance dramatic changes in the timing of sce such as late or early spring snowmelt and ill timed peak coverage may lead to extreme hydrological events and adverse effects to water resource management in downstream areas since the area of each subregion and the entire region of eurasia are different it is not proper to compare the sce for different subregions directly therefore we used a standardized proxy scf in the remaining text to show the variability in sce simply scf is the ratio of snow covered area to the total area of a subregion or all of eurasia fig 3 a plots the multiyear mean september 1972 to june 2007 annual cycle of scf averaged over four subregions as well as for all of eurasia evident seasonal variations in scf were observed across the entire eurasian continent with higher values in winter and lower values in summer overall eurasian scf peaks in january with maximum values of ca 60 from early october to late april snow covered more than 25 of total area of eurasia with regard to the four subregions the seasonal variations of scf depended on the corresponding locations and varied by subregion in eastern subregion ie and western subregion iw siberia averaged scfs remain larger than 60 in all seasons except summer with a value of 100 lasting approximately 6 7 months in a year the maximum scf over subregion ii was roughly 88 in february followed by a steady decline until july while the extent of snow cover in the tibetan plateau is expected to be very widespread during cold seasons snow seldom falls in southeastern china and southern asia leading to a lowest scf in subregion iii of which weekly values were even less than 20 in winter the multiyear mean january 1979 to may 2005 seasonal variation of swe in fig 3b demonstrates that snow usually begins accumulating in november growing in depth until peaking in february or march after which swe falls rapidly in april across eurasia the late peak and short ablation duration lead to spring droughts and are beneficial to people living in the region in some winters the peak was delayed by about 1 month whereas in other winters the peak appeared earlier by two weeks broad peaks last for 10 weeks whereas sharp peaks last for only 4 weeks the peak snow amount also varied markedly the peak amounts of snow storage between heavy and light snow winters differed by 68 41 51 and 24 mm in subregions iw ie ii and iii respectively the highly variable nature of annual cycles was principally responsible for the anomalies in spring runoff as well as for the seasonality of river flow in the region note that the annual pattern of swe for subregion iii differed from those for the other subregions fig 3b a good example of this is in the tibetan plateau where the snow season normally begins in mid september the swe grew rapidly in the first half of winter with the maximum coverage occurring in february a very slow decline in swe followed until june because of the generally low temperature a long snow season early snow peak rapid increase in snow depth and slow snowmelt were evident in this area of all snow seasons winter december february djf had the largest snow storage accounting for 45 2 of the annual snow storage spring march may mam and autumn september november son occupied 28 0 and 21 2 of the annual snow storage respectively 3 3 interannual variations of snow cover fraction normalized year to year variations of scf were rather low in winter whereas the normalized variability increased toward spring and peaked in autumn when only remnants of snow are left in siberia figs 3a and 4 this finding is reasonable because the winter snowpack was quite stable in most parts of the northern eurasia where temperatures remained below the freezing point for all subregions the scf with the greatest interannual variability occurred in autumn son fig 4 c this was especially true for subregions iw and ie of which the largest anomaly reached 15 in both positive and negative directions fig 4c during the snow ablation season mam scf has relatively lower interannual variability compared with son figs 3a and 4b note that in summer and autumn when the subregional mean scfs are normally low the normalized standard deviations may be less reliable because moderate variations in total scf may drastically change the normalized variations while the annual mean scf for the present study period did not show a significant declining trend over the whole of eurasia table 1 it decreased significantly over subregions iw and iii with rates of 0 8 10 yr and 0 5 10 yr respectively in the maximum snow season djf the extent of snow cover in all subregions changed little during the entire period of 1972 2006 in particular scf during djf in the subregions i and ii were almost 100 in all years because of their high latitudes the scf in the summer june august jja shrunk significantly in all subregions except in eastern siberia in particular the scf in jja fell significantly at rates of 1 8 10 yr and 0 9 10 yr in subregions iw and iii respectively leading to a significant decline 0 8 10 yr of summer scf over all of eurasia during the study period similarly the scf in the snow ablation season mam also declined in every subregion although such decreasing trends were not significant except in subregion iii during the snow accumulation season son the scf showed slight decreasing trends in all subregions except in eastern siberia 3 4 interannual variations of the onset disappearance timing and persistence period of snow cover fig 5 provides details related to the spatial heterogeneity of the trends of snow cover onset and time of disappearance as well as the snow cover persistence period across eurasia during 1972 2006 derived from weekly ease grid sce data note again that the trends are given in the unit of week 10 yr basically a positive trend of the onset timings dominated in the southern tibetan plateau but it varied little over siberia negative disappearance timing trend was common across the continent and particularly concentrated in western siberia central asia tibetan plateau mongolia and the northern border of the eurasian continent the snow cover persistence period decreased significantly in the western tibetan plateau and southern part of central asia with a rates of approximately 2 week 10 yr and in parts of northwestern russia with a rates of about 1 2 week 10 yr however snow cover persistence period increased slightly in a belt between 110 and 140 e in terms of the entire region of eurasia more than 60 of all grids showed a declining trend in the snow cover persistence period which is consistent with the overall negative trend of entire regional mean snow cover persistence period see table 2 the anomaly time series of the snow cover onset timing disappearance timing and persistence period from 1972 to 2006 across each subregion and the entire eurasian continent are depicted in the fig 6 along with corresponding trends illustrated in table 2 with regard to the whole eurasia where snow cover has started to appear a little later and terminated significantly earlier the snow cover persistence period showed a slight decreasing trend during 1972 2006 the timing of the occurrence of snow cover in autumn in both subregions iw and ie became slightly earlier during 1972 2006 as can be seen their negative trends the timing of the disappearance of snow cover however also became earlier in these two regions with trends of 0 49 and 0 28 week 10 yr respectively as a result the snow cover persistence period only showed slight decreasing trends with rates of 0 33 and 0 08 week 10 yr for subregions iw and ie respectively subregions ii and iii varied by similar phases the snow cover started later i e slight and significant positive trends for onset timing of subregions ii and iii respectively but disappeared significantly earlier i e significant negative trends for the time of disappearance this resulted in slightly shortened length for the snow cover persistence period from 1972 to 2006 with trends of 0 18 and 0 16 week 10 yr respectively to summarize the timing of the onset of snow cover varied little except for a significant delay in subregion iii while the timing of the disappearance of snow cover significantly decreased in the majority of subregions except for in subregion ie table 2 3 5 interannual variations of swe to investigate the interannual variability in mean swe over the study domain a snow cover area weighted monthly mean swe was computed over the grid domain normalized time series of mean swe for winter spring and autumn and the annual series which was averaged over all subregions and the whole of eurasia are shown in fig 7 at a regional scale both annual mean and seasonal mean swe across eurasia showed significant decreasing trends during 1979 2004 table 3 regarding to the four subregions the annual mean swe declined significantly in all subregions except in eastern siberia subregion ie similarly winter spring and autumn mean swe also fell significantly in these three subregions the swe in subregion ie varied little in all seasons except spring where it significantly declined at a rate of 5 7 mm 10 yr during the study period table 3 generally stable accumulations are suggested by the swe time series in autumn with a low interannual variability however dramatic heterogeneity of snowmelt both temporally and spatially is suggested by the time series in spring of four subregions fig 7 in general the winter and spring swe have similar trends to the annual swe because of large contribution of the former to the annual values one of the most useful variables for assessing water availability is annual maximum swe or the amount of water that would be obtained by melting of the accumulated snow jenicek et al 2016 water resource managers can estimate the water available for use in spring by the swe of a given season such information is also vital for emergency managers involved in assessing the potential for snow melt induced floods furthermore long term records of swe are also useful to architects and civil engineers trying to determine snow load standards for structures fig 8 shows the spatial pattern of the trends of annual maximum swe during 1979 2004 specifically positive trends extended widely over eastern siberia as well as northwestern and northeastern china and also in part of central asia whereas negative trends dominated in western siberia the trends of maximum swe were generally spatially heterogeneous in the mid latitude region subregion ii ranging from 2 to 2 mm 10 yr these trends must be considered in the context of their representativeness of interannual changes fig 9 shows that the anomalies of annual maximum swe averaged in every subregion and the whole of eurasia one can see that subregion iw had a most obvious interannual variability of annual maximum swe leading to possibly remarkable interannual variations of water resources in spring over the western siberia 4 discussions 4 1 comparisons with previous studies this study examined the temporal and spatial variability in the snow cover extent sce and snow water equivalent swe in the continental eurasia as a whole and as divided into four subregions the investigation was based on quantitative analyses of satellite observed ease grid weekly sce data and monthly swe data we found a significantly decreasing trend in snow covered areas during spring and summer while snow covered areas varied little or even increased slightly during winter and autumn from 1972 to 2006 over the entire scale of eurasia which agreed with the findings of déry and brown 2007 and robinson and frei 2000 brown 2000 found that significant sce shrinking in april over the western eurasia represents a decrease in mean snow cover in excess of 20 during 1922 1997 brown and robinson 2011 further suggested that the declines in march and april sce over northern hemisphere during the period of 1970 2010 equaled to a 7 and 11 decrease in those of pre 1970s values respectively mccabe and wolock 2009 attributed the significant decrease of march sce since 1970 to the substantial increase of winter temperatures over northern hemisphere yeo et al 2017 suggested that the decreased sce over the eurasia during spring is predominantly attributed to the warm air temperature anomalies while the increased sce in october was due to the loss of arctic sea ice and the ensuing moisture transport to the atmosphere in general the date when spring snow cover began to disappear in eurasia advanced significantly from 1972 to 2006 while only slightly negative trends were observed for the onset of snow cover in the two highest latitude subregions i e subregions iw and ie mostly above 60 n the snow cover in other two subregions with relatively low latitudes was starting later during the study period in particular subregion iii showed a significantly positive trend of the onset snow cover with a rate of 0 69 week 10 yr these results were generally consistent with an analysis employing the records of meteorological stations by peng et al 2013 who suggested that the termination onset date of snow cover has advanced delayed by 2 6 5 6 d decade 1 3 4 9 d decade during 1980 2006 across eurasia consistent with previous studies that indicated an increase in the snow free period caused by climatic warming maxwell 1992 dye 2002 we found overall shortening trends for the snow cover persistence period in eurasia during 1972 2006 table 2 however such trends were only significant in the southern part of central asia the western tibetan plateau and parts of northwestern russia the results of the present study were generally consistent with han et al 2014 who also identified a significant decrease in the duration of the snow cover over the tibetan plateau using the pmw radiometer derived snow cover data similarly rikiishi and nakasato 2006 quantified that the length of a snow cover season was generally decreasing at rates of 0 2 0 4 week yr in the karakoram ranges and 0 0 2 week yr in the tibetan plateau during 1966 2011 dye 2002 also demonstrated that the duration of the snow free days in northern hemisphere has increased by ca 3 6 d decade during 1972 2000 principally as a result of earlier snow cover disappearance in spring because the sce data used in the present study has only weekly values it may be not able to capture the fast snow accumulation ablation processes under abrupt weather conditions that is the relatively low temporal resolution of sce product may impact the accuracy of the snow cover persistence period shown here though such a concern may be only true occasionally in certain areas we believe that future data with improved temporal and or spatial resolutions would be of help for comprehensive monitoring the variability of snow cover persistence period in a changing climate overall swe showed highest values in the eastern siberia but it decreased both southward and westward because swe data is essentially derived from the estimated snow depth using the satellite observed brightness temperature chang et al 1987 the variations in snow depth based on station observations show features similar to those of the swe qin et al 2006 wu and kirtman 2007 note that the decreasing trends of swe during 1979 2004 found in the present study may bear some uncertainties since this swe product is derived from smmr and ssm i for the periods of 1979 1987 and 1987 2005 respectively inevitably the different spatial temporal and radiometric resolutions between these two pmw radiometers may cause potential inconsistencies which are critical for characterizing the long term variability in swe clifford 2010 a previous consistency assessment using observations during summer suggested that ssm i brightness temperatures might systematically exceed smmr measurements over north america derksen et al 2003 however the lack of a direct overlap in winter between the two sensors makes it difficult to determine whether such differences are caused by the internal variations of swe in a changing climate or by cross platform inconsistencies we believe that if more adjustments that are more sophisticated were used to produce a more consistent brightness temperature time series this could remedy such a possible deficiency so this topic deserves further study in future 4 2 effects of cold season snow free breaks on the snow cover persistence period we found significantly negative correlations between the length of snow cover persistence period and the timing of the onset of snow cover in a majority of subregions except for subregion iii at the same time the length of snow cover persistence period was significantly and positively correlated with the timing of the disappearance of snow cover in most subregions except for subregion ii fig 10 the slope in each regression equation in fig 10 essentially represents the overall sensitivity of the snow cover persistence period to the timings of the onset disappearance of snow cover in subregions iw and ie the slopes are slightly smaller than 1 due to the short interval between the subregional mean onset timing of snow cover to the timing when scf reached 100 that is also true for the snowmelt process during the spring season in subregions ii and iii however the slopes are much smaller than 1 in particular a 1 week advance of the time of snow disappearance and 1 week delay of the onset only leads to shortening of 0 11 week and 0 02 week of snow cover persistence period for subregion iii respectively fig 10 although the relatively low scf in these two subregions also had an effect in calculating the subregional mean snow cover onset and disappearance timings the possible intermittence of snow cover during the cold season may also play an important role in such a low sensitivity furthermore the sce analysis in table 2 also reveals inconsistent changes between the timings of the onset disappearance of snow cover and its persistence periods in the subregions ii and iii where shallow snow was widely distributed specifically the timings of snow cover onset have delayed to some extent with trends of 0 08 and 0 69 week 10 yr in subregions ii and iii respectively meanwhile the time of snow cover disappearance was starting significantly earlier with trends of 0 47 and 0 88 week 10 yr in the same respective subregions however the snow cover persistence periods were only slightly shortened by 0 18 and 0 16 week 10 yr in subregions ii and iii respectively such an apparent contradiction might be explained by the temporal discontinuity of snow cover possible causes of the temporal discontinuity are sublimation as well as drifting and or fast melting that cause snow cover to be intermittent in a cold season if the snow is not thick enough for example qin et al 2006 suggested that sublimation contributes largely to decreases in the scf during winter and may consume all the snow mass over areas covered by thin snow in western china ye and ellison 2003 attributed this type of a temporal discontinuity to the transitional snowfall season i e the difference between the first last snowfall date and the first last date of continuous ground snow cover and considered it to be present even in northern siberia here we referred to this type of a discontinuity as a snow free break sfb because it may be witnessed in mid cold season fig 11 illustrates the multiyear mean and maximum sfbs across eurasia during 1972 2006 it can be seen that the sfbs mainly occurred south of 50 n and was concentrated in the tibetan plateau and central asia in particular the averaged intermittence of snow cover was 1 14 weeks and could even reach 25 weeks in certain extreme years in the tibetan plateau we believe that such obvious discontinuities of snow cover over the tibetan plateau were a result of the very low amount of precipitation received during winter the winter precipitation with an amount of less than 75 mm averaged for the entire tibetan plateau generally occupies less than 10 of annual total precipitation wang et al 2017b sui et al 2013 the largest sfb e g mean value of 14 weeks appeared in the northwestern part of tibetan plateau in which the lowest precipitation typically occurs the presently observed sfbs are also consistent with basist et al 1996 and armstrong and brodzik 2001 who reported that snow cover in tibetan plateau is often intermittent in spatial distribution specifically they suggested that although roughly 50 of the plateau was being snow covered the single snow covered area hardly exceeded several hundred square kilometers armstrong and brodzik 2001 basist et al 1996 rikiishi and nakasato 2006 also quantified that during approximately 40 of the days of the cold season the ground was not covered by snow in most parts of tibetan plateau 5 conclusions the present study analyzed the spatiotemporal variability of snow cover and snow water equivalent over eurasia using the satellite observed ease grid weekly sce data and monthly swe data from 1972 to 2006 the spatial extent of snow cover during spring and summer has decreased significantly but it varied little during winter and autumn in most parts of eurasia in general during 1972 2006 the date when spring snow cover began to disappear in eurasia has significantly advanced whereas the onset timing of snow cover varied little in most parts of eurasia the multiyear mean snow cover persistence period showed zonal distribution between 40 n and 80 n declining with the decrease in latitude from more than 31 weeks to less than 5 weeks however it became more dependent on the elevation over the high mountain asia over the 35 year study period the length of snow cover persistence period overall declined but such negative trends are only significant in the western tibetan plateau and southern part of central asia with rates of about 2 week 10 yr and in parts of the northwestern of russia with a rate of 1 2 week 10 yr snow free breaks with intermittent snow cover in the mid cold season were mainly observed in the tibetan plateau and central asia with values of 1 14 weeks average during 1972 2006 causing a low sensitivity of the length of snow cover persistence period to the onset and disappearance timings in subregions ii and iii the swe was largest in the eastern siberia and decreased both southward and westward differing from the spatial pattern of snow cover persistence period seasonally swe usually reached the maximum in february or march followed by a gradual decline since april across eurasia both the annual mean and annual maximum swe decreased significantly during 1979 2004 in most parts of eurasia except for eastern siberia as well as northwestern and northeastern china note that the potential inconsistencies between two passive microwave sensors may lead to uncertainties in the detected trend of swe from 1979 to 2004 over eurasia in the present study a wide range of studies have attempted to elucidate the causes of such sce and swe changes however both sce and swe changes do not fully correspond with changes in air temperature which has significantly increased in cold seasons e g mccabe and wolock 2009 yeo et al 2017 you et al 2010 numerous researchers have also demonstrated that atmospheric circulation is the factor indirectly influencing snow cover by acting on radiation temperature and precipitation conditions clark et al 1999 seager et al 2010 more knowledge of atmospheric circulation snow cover

7383,using a moisture tracking model with 32 year reanalysis data and station precipitation observations we diagnosed the sources of moisture for summer june 1 august 31 precipitation in mid lower reaches of the yangtze river basin yrb results indicate the dominant role of oceanic evaporation compared to terrestrial evapotranspiration and the previously overlooked southern indian ocean as a source region is found to contribute more moisture than the well known arabian sea or bay of bengal terrestrial evapotranspiration appears to be important for summer precipitation especially in early june when moisture contribution is more than 50 the terrestrial contribution then decreases and is generally less than 40 after late june the indian ocean is the most important oceanic source before mid july with its largest contribution during the period of heavy precipitation while the pacific ocean becomes the more important oceanic source after mid july to quantitatively analyze paths of moisture transport to yrb we proposed the trajectory frequency method the most intense branch of water vapor transport to yrb stretches from the arabian sea through the bay of bengal the indochina peninsula the south china sea and south china the other main transport branches are westerly moisture fluxes to the south of the tibetan plateau cross equatorial flows north of australia and separate branches located in the north and equatorial pacific ocean significant intraseasonal variability for these branches is presented additionally the importance of the south china sea for moisture transport to yrb especially from the sea areas is emphasized keywords quantitative diagnosis mid lower yangtze river basin summer precipitation moisture sources moisture paths 1 introduction the mid lower reaches of the yangtze river basin yrb is one of the most densely populated regions in the world ge and feng 2010 wei et al 2012 and one of the most economically developed regions in china huang et al 2013 however in summer when precipitation accounts for 40 50 of the annual amount zhou et al 2009 this region has been threatened frequently by severe floods zeng et al 2016 e g the 1998 flood caused about 4000 deaths and 26 billion in economic losses wei et al 2012 floods are primarily caused by heavy precipitation wei et al 2012 which is directly related to sufficient water vapor and its transport process huang et al 2004 trenberth 2011 sun and wang 2014b knowledge about the atmospheric water transport process is important for assessing and managing water resources martinez and dominguez 2014 and may improve the predictive skill of numerical models and also help design the observational network in the upstream region which could benefit heavy precipitation forecasts chen et al 2013 therefore it is important to understand where the moisture may originate i e moisture sources dirmeyer and brubaker 1999 guo and wang 2014 and how it is transported to sink regions i e moisture transport pathways zhou et al 2008 e g yrb the origin of water vapor over yrb has been studied extensively using a range of methods it is well known that yrb is a typical monsoon area wang and lin 2002 ding and chan 2005 the moisture supply for yrb is largely influenced by southerly winds which are controlled by the indian summer monsoon ism and the east asian summer monsoon easm and bring substantial moisture from the indian ocean and from the western pacific along the west margin of the western pacific subtropical high wpsh in summer xue et al 2003 wang and chen 2012 sun and wang 2015 zeng et al 2017 consequently many previous studies have highlighted the importance of oceanic sources for summer precipitation over yrb some early works suggested that the bay of bengal the south china sea and the western pacific are the main moisture sources for yrb summer precipitation using the method of calculating water vapor flux e g simmonds et al 1999 zhou and yu 2005 he et al 2007 zhou et al 2008 xu et al 2008 argued that the low latitude band from the bayof bengal to the philippines is the dominant moisture source region for yrb summer precipitation using the method of correlation analysis based on the information along trajectories from a particle dispersion model flexpart stohl and james 2004 2005 proposed a method to identify moisture sources for precipitation using this method chen et al 2013 identified the east china sea south china sea indian peninsula and the bay of bengal and arabian sea as four major moisture sources for yrb summer water vapor however several studies have indicated the importance of terrestrial sources for yrb summer precipitation for example van der ent et al 2010 found that the moisture evaporating from the eurasian continent contributed most water vapor to annual precipitation over china when studying the origin of atmospheric moisture over global continents based on a method termed the water accounting model using a lagrangian method called the quasi isentropic back trajectory qibt method dirmeyer and brubaker 1999 2007 brubaker et al 2001 wei et al 2012 explored the sources of water vapor for wet season precipitation over yrb and found that the major direct moisture sources are yrb itself and the associated over land moisture transport pathways other important moisture sources include the bay of bengal the indochina peninsula the south china sea and the western north pacific ocean with the flexpart model drumond et al 2011 found that the moisture evaporating from land areas is important for summer precipitation over yrb and sun and wang 2015 found that evapotranspiration over land seems to be the dominant source of moisture for summer precipitation in yrb while the evaporation over the western pacific follows in a quantitative study the aforementioned results indicated that knowledge about the moisture sources for yrb summer precipitation has not reached a consensus in addition to the differences in data and study region the drawbacks of methods used in previous studies could limit the identification of exact moisture sources and may contribute more to the differences in their results as indicated by wei et al 2012 the method of calculating water vapor flux is difficult to identify moisture sources and sinks and simple correlation analysis is difficult to generate convincing conclusions the qibt method uses quasi isentropic tracking which may lead to limitations when diabatic process is important and assumes that evaporation can contribute to the moisture increase along trajectories that are above the boundary layer sodemann et al 2008 the method based on flexpart however cannot clearly separate evaporation and precipitation gimeno et al 2012 therefore the identification of moisture sources for yrb summer precipitation may be obtained using other effective methods such as the modified dynamic recycling model drm dominguez et al 2006 martinez and dominguez 2014 the drm which is directly derived from the vertically integrated balance equation for water vapor was initially proposed by dominguez et al 2006 for the study of precipitation recycling dominguez and kumar 2008 dominguez et al 2008 and has been used to study local precipitation recycling in regions in china hua et al 2015 2016 martinez and dominguez 2014 subsequently modified the drm to study the moisture sources for precipitation over the la plata river basin compared with the aforementioned qibt dirmeyer and brubaker 1999 2007 brubaker et al 2001 and flexpart stohl and james 2004 2005 nieto et al 2014 the drm is computationally much less demanding hu and dominguez 2015 another significant advantage of the drm is that it is valid at the daily timescale as it explicitly includes temporal changes in moisture storage bisselink and dolman 2008 which were neglected in previous precipitation recycling models budyko 1974 brubaker et al 1993 eltahir and bras 1994 making them valid only at monthly or longer timescales however the drm assumes a well mixed atmosphere which neglects some physical and dynamic processes in the atmosphere and may cause errors in regions with strong vertical wind shear or otherwise incomplete vertical mixing goessling and reick 2013 despite this possible limitation the drm has been shown to produce good results when used to study moisture sources over the south american continent hoyos et al 2017 and it has also been applied successfully to the north american monsoon region hu and dominguez 2015 additionally it has been indicated that the well mixed assumption applies better over yrb than over the south american continent or the north american monsoon region and the vertical shear condition over yrb is similar to those over the south american continent and the north american monsoon region e g figs 3 and 4 by goessling and reick 2013 and fig 11 by van der ent et al 2013 these results provide confidence that the drm can be used as a proper method to study moisture sources for summer precipitation over yrb whereas a variety of methods have been used to study moisture sources somewhat fewer methods are available to study water vapor transport paths stohl and james 2004 and dominguez et al 2008 used the method of listing part of trajectories to diagnose moisture transport pathways however presenting the trajectories is an intuitive method which is not directly and numerically quantified and would make the interpretation of the results more dependent on users to some extent thus it is necessary to quantitatively deal with the large number of trajectories after obtaining them with various tracking methods currently a commonly used method to quantitatively diagnose water vapor transport pathways e g sodemann et al 2008 sun and wang 2014a huang and cui 2015 is cluster analysis e g moody and galloway 1988 dorling et al 1992 however this approach is somewhat subjective as it involves grouping a large number of vapor trajectories into an arbitrary number of clusters david et al 2010 li et al 2016 li et al 2016 used a circulation constrained method by grouping trajectories into several predefined categories based on the general circulation feature and particle positions along the trajectories which did not show the complete moisture transport paths and could overlook some detailed characteristics of moisture transport therefore it is necessary to develop new methods that account for all trajectories to diagnose water vapor transport pathways both quantitatively and objectively in this paper our objectives are i to quantitatively estimate the sources of moisture for summer precipitation over yrb using the modified drm dominguez et al 2006 martinez and dominguez 2014 and ii to quantitatively diagnose water vapor transport pathways using a newly developed method hence after the description for study site and materials section 2 these objectives provide the structural sub headings used in the following methods section 3 results section 4 and discussion section 5 sections 2 study site and materials 2 1 study site in this study the sink region we chose is the mid lower reaches of the yangtze river basin i e yrb in fig 1 which is the same as that in xu et al 2008 located in east china yrb is a typical east asian monsoon region and characterized by the meiyu front in summer e g ge et al 2008 jiang et al 2009 ding et al 2010 though we chose yrb as the sink region the potential source area fig 1 encompasses most of the eurasian continent the indian ocean and the pacific ocean which is large enough to ensure that the relative contribution from evaporation along the trajectory to precipitation in the sink region is close to 1 the total source area is divided into 16 sub regions fig 1 based on the results of previous studies e g wei et al 2012 sun and wang 2015 and large scale geography of these regions chosen 7 sub regions are land based and 9 are oceanic regions 3 of the 9 oceanic regions are part of the indian ocean 5 are part of the pacific ocean and another 1 oceanic region is the residual sea portion of the total source area 2 2 materials 2 2 1 the reanalysis data we use data from the 32 year 1979 2010 6 h resolution climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr from the national centers for environmental prediction ncep https rda ucar edu datasets ds093 0 which is a third generation reanalysis product that provides a very good estimate of a global land ocean atmosphere coupled system at high spatiotemporal resolution and over an extended period saha et al 2010 geophysical fields used in this study include latent heat flux surface pressure precipitation zonal and meridional wind speeds and specific humidity the atmospheric data zonal and meridional wind speeds and specific humidity are available on a 0 5 0 5 horizontal grid with 37 pressure levels from 1000 to 1 hpa but here we only use data from the lowest 23 levels from 1000 to 200 hpa precipitation data are provided at the same horizontal resolution latent heat flux and surface pressure data are provided at a higher resolution of 0 3125 but are bilinearly interpolated onto the same 0 5 grid for this analysis zonal and meridional wind speeds specific humidity and surface pressure were used to calculate precipitable water and moisture weighted zonal and meridional wind fields latent heat flux was used to calculate total evapotranspiration which is not provided explicitly by cfsr lorenz and kunstmann 2012 according to the classification of kalnay et al 1996 zonal and meridional wind are type a variables that is data are reliable as they are strongly constrained by observations specific humidity is a type b variable and we consider it also to be reliable as it is influenced by both the model and observations actual evapotranspiration and precipitation are type c variables which are determined entirely by model physics for catchments where there is limited preferable no inter basin water transfer and limited water regulation the long term actual evapotranspiration can be validated against the result of long term i e at least 10 years precipitation minus streamflow donohue et al 2007 liu et al 2016 yang et al 2016 for regions that are not the catchments in hydrology e g potential moisture source areas in this study fig 1 the method for evaporation validation using precipitation minus runoff is not applicable the validity of precipitation can however be estimated through comparison with observational data 2 2 2 correction of the cfsr precipitation we compared cfsr precipitation with observations from 86 stations http data cma cn in yrb and found significant differences in both temporal evolution and spatial distributions fig 2 cfsr precipitation is overestimated from late june onwards and the spatial distribution is quite different from that of the observation stations the pattern correlation coefficient is 0 52 though these differences may have only a small impact on the recycling ratio dominguez et al 2006 they do affect the amount of precipitation that is contributed by each source region therefore we corrected the cfsr 6 hourly precipitation by the following steps i daily precipitation from 86 stations in yrb and the surrounding area were interpolated onto the 0 5 grid using the barnes scheme barnes 1964 to obtain grid observational data ii the cfsr 6 hourly precipitation on each grid in yrb was aggregated to daily precipitation and iii the 6 hourly cfsr precipitation was corrected by multiplying the ratio of daily observational precipitation to the cfsr precipitation the mean time series of the corrected cfsr precipitation is highly consistent with the station precipitation series fig 2a indicating that the correction is reasonable 3 methods 3 1 the moisture sources of precipitation the modified drm dominguez et al 2006 martinez and dominguez 2014 was used to calculate the moisture sources of precipitation in this study in the drm the vertically integrated balance equation for water vapor is resolved by applying a semi lagrangian scheme and the recycling ratio is expressed as 1 r χ ξ τ 1 exp 0 τ ε χ ξ τ ω χ ξ τ τ where χ ξ and τ represent the x y and t dimensions respectively and r ε and ω are the recycling ratio evapotranspiration and precipitable water respectively in the semi lagrangian coordinate system χ ξ τ in the modified drm martinez and dominguez 2014 the recycling ratio for a large domain was decomposed into moisture contributions from several sub regions thus it can be used to quantify the relative contributions from different sources to the atmospheric moisture over a given sink region we implemented a tracking algorithm for each grid point in the sink region every 6 h to coincide with the cfsr resolution each tracking algorithm was stopped when the tracking time was longer than 40 days or the trajectory was out of the source area as shown in fig 1 as described by martinez and dominguez 2014 the value of a k i j t which represents the contribution from the source region a k to the moisture at point i j was calculated the averaged precipitation over a chosen period e g one day p m a k a s over the sink region a s i e yrb in this study contributed by the source region a k can be expressed as 2 p m a k a s t i j a s p i j t a k i j t δ a i j i j a s δ a i j where p i j t is the 6 hourly precipitation at grid point i j and δ a i j is the area of the cell centered at i j the averaged precipitation p a s over the sink region a s can be calculated as 3 p a s t i j a s p i j t δ a i j i j a s δ a i j therefore the ratio of the contribution from moisture evaporating from the source region a k to precipitation over the sink region a s can be expressed as 4 r a k a s p m a k a s p a s throughout this paper we refer to p m a k a s as the amount contribution hu and dominguez 2015 and to r a k a s multiplied by 100 as the percentage contribution it should be noted that both a source region a k and a sink region a s can represent either a larger region or a single grid cell within the 0 5 0 5 mesh 3 2 the moisture transport paths to evaluate both quantitatively and objectively the pathways of water vapor transport into a given area e g yrb we propose a method utilizing the density frequency of moisture trajectories termed the trajectory frequency method tfm which is described below as the drm calculates the moisture sources of precipitation by the lagrangian tracking e g martinez and dominguez 2014 the exact location within a certain grid cell for a moisture parcel can be recorded at each time step and then a trajectory could be obtained after a tracking for each grid cell with a precipitation event during a tracking interval e g in agreement with the interval of the cfsr data 6 hourly trackings were performed throughout june august in the present study at each time step of tracking i e the 6 hourly interval here the numbers of trajectories on each grid cell were recorded and accumulated if there exist n a s trajectories that arrive on the sink region a s during a specific period e g one day each passing through different grid cells then if a grid cell i j has n i j a s trajectories passing through it the ratio of grid cell i j passed through by the total trajectories could be calculated as 5 r f i j a s n i j a s n a s fig 3 a shows a schematic of the calculation of r f i j a s by using the r f i j a s parameter large numbers of trajectories are reduced to a 2 d dimensionless frequency distribution which presents as compared to above mentioned method for moisture paths more quantitative and detailed information during water vapor transport along the trajectories similar to a grid cell the ratio of a certain region a k passed through by the total trajectories could also be expressed as 6 r f a k a s n a k a s n a s where n a k a s represents the number of trajectories that pass through the region a k among the n a s trajectories fig 3b we refer to the n a s trajectories end in the moisture sink region a s as the a s end i e yrb end in this study trajectories and the n a k a s trajectories that pass through the region a k as the a k pass e g scs pass trajectories in this paper this ratio in eq 6 reflects the importance of the region a k for the water vapor transport to the sink region a s a higher ratio indicates a k is more important for the water vapor transport to a s e g if the ratio is close to 1 it could be concluded that a k is the dominant area with the most moisture transport pathways when considering the a k pass trajectories as the total trajectories two ratios similar to those in eqs 5 and 6 could be obtained as 7 r f i j a k n i j a k n a k a s and 8 r f a l a k n a l a k n a k a s where n i j a k n a l a k is the number of trajectories that pass through grid cell i j region a l with the location in the downstream of a k among the n a k a s a k pass trajectories note that n a l a k is not the summation of n i j a k over the grid cells in a particular region e g if one trajectory passes through many grid cells over the region n a l a k 1 as eq 7 only involves the a k pass trajectories the 2 d distribution of r f i j a k specifically reflects both the paths of water vapor transport to the sink region a s from source region a k and the source regions these source regions are upstream for a k and also provide evaporated moisture for precipitation in the sink region a s through the a k pass trajectories notably the 2 d distribution of r f i j a s also includes the path information of water vapor transport from a k but reflects the moisture transport paths to the sink region from a k less clearly than the distribution of r f i j a k the value of r f a l a k could be used to reflect the importance of region a l for the transport of moisture evaporating from the source region a k to the sink region a s fig 3b the tfm can quantitatively record information from numerous calculated trajectories using the ratios of trajectories passing through a grid cell or region i e eqs 5 and 7 for individual grid cells and eqs 6 and 8 for regions it is noteworthy that the drm derived percentage contributions denote the contribution of evaporation to precipitation while the tfm derived ratios represent the dominant water vapor transport pathways and could also be a supplementary parameter for hydrological cycling 4 results 4 1 the moisture sources of precipitation in this section the modified drm dominguez et al 2006 martinez and dominguez 2014 is used to quantitatively diagnose the sources of moisture for summer precipitation over yrb 4 1 1 summer mean 4 1 1 1 grid cell evaporation contributions to yrb precipitation fig 4 shows the distribution of percentage contributions from each grid cell to summer precipitation over yrb the precipitationsheds i e the upwind atmosphere and surface that contributes evaporation to a specific region s precipitation keys et al 2012 were calculated using the method similar to that by van der ent and savenije 2013 at 70 black dots and 90 black and grey dots thresholds similar to the result of wei et al 2012 the major moisture sources are located to the southwest of yrb and large contributions come from yrb itself and surrounding land areas the indochina peninsula the south china sea the western pacific and the indian ocean are also important source regions 4 1 1 2 source region evaporation contributions to yrb precipitation the percentage contributions of the 16 sub regions to yrb summer precipitation are shown in fig 5 yrb chi sea ars bb si scs and wp are clearly the main sources of moisture for summer precipitation over yrb these eight sources contribute 90 of the moisture for summer precipitation over yrb among them chi contributes the most moisture 18 1 followed by wp 14 6 and ars contributes the least 7 4 the percentage contribution from yrb i e the recycling ratio is 9 similar to the contributions from sea bb and scs it is surprising that though the percentage contributions from si grid cells are much lower than those in ars or bb fig 4 the percentage contribution from si is as much as 12 9 which is larger than that from ars or bb the combined contributions from land areas the indian ocean and the pacific ocean were also calculated the percentage contribution from land areas is 40 2 which similar to the result 41 8 of sun and wang 2015 the contribution from sea areas is 57 7 and contributions from the indian and pacific oceans are 29 9 and 27 6 respectively 4 1 1 3 source region evaporation contributions to precipitation of grid cells within yrb we next analyze contributions from the eight key moisture source regions to summer precipitation in individual grid cells in yrb as shown in fig 6 the distributions of the contributions from the eight major moisture source regions show large scale gradients but the directions of strongest variability are different the largest contributions from yrb itself are to the northeast corner of the yrb region while the contributions to the south and west areas of yrb are lower this is primarily a result of the directionality imparted by the summer monsoon the contributions from chi decrease from northwest to southeast while the contributions from scs and wp decrease from southeast to northwest the contributions from sea ars bb and si all decrease from southwest to northeast the distributions of contributions from external sources fig 6b h are generally a result of how moisture from these sources penetrate into yrb e g moisture from sea ars bb and si would mainly flow into yrb from the southwest as the percentage contributions decrease along downwind directions with a larger loss of moisture due to the precipitation process along a longer trajectory 4 1 2 intraseasonal variability the summer season june 1 to august 31 is now divided into 18 pentads to analyze the intraseasonal variability of the contributions from different source regions the 12th and 18th pentads are actually 6 days in length to account for the total of 31 days in july and august respectively the amount and percentage contributions from land areas the indian ocean and the pacific ocean and sub regions within throughout the summer season are shown in figs 7 and 8 fig 7 highlights the importance of terrestrial moisture for summer precipitation over yrb especially in early june when the percentage contribution from land areas exceeds 50 however the relative importance of land areas gradually decreases to percentage contributions of 35 40 in late june as the increase in the amount contribution from land does not keep pace with the increase in yrb precipitation the seesaw relationship between contributions from the indian ocean and the pacific ocean can also be seen in fig 7 which well corresponds to the same relationship between the contributions from bb and wp which was identified by wei et al 2012 the indian ocean is the more important oceanic source before july 11 especially during the period of heavy precipitation while the pacific ocean becomes more important from july 26 the two oceans contribute similar amounts of moisture between july 11 and july 25 chi is the most important source among land sub regions fig 8a and b accounting for around half of the total land contribution throughout summer similar to wei et al 2012 the contribution from yrb the recycling ratio is lower during the period of intense precipitation the contributions from the three sub regions of the indian ocean fig 8c and d show almost identical intraseasonal variation the contribution from si ars is the largest smallest among the three sub regions while the contribution from bb is intermediate throughout summer with the exception of the first pentad the percentage contribution from si increases faster than that of ars or bb in june when the percentage contribution from the indian ocean as a whole is increasing fig 8e and f show the temporal evolution of the contributions from the two main sub regions of the pacific ocean and through comparison with fig 7 it can be seen that the amount contribution from scs closely follows the total yrb precipitation the percentage contribution from scs remains steady at around 10 after june 21 during which temporal variability in the pacific ocean contribution comes mainly from wp in august wp becomes the most important of the eight sources probably due to the northeastward movement of wpsh and the landfall of typhoons ren et al 2002 su and xue 2010 wei et al 2012 the intraseasonal variability can be also found in contributions from each grid cell fig 9 during june 1 5 fig 9a the largest contributions are from yrb and land areas to the southwest while the contributions from oceanic areas particularly wp are lower by june 26 30 fig 9b contributions from grid cells over land have decreased substantially while the contributions from oceanic areas have increased especially in the indian ocean later during july 21 25 fig 9c the most notable feature is that the contributions from grid cells in the indian ocean have decreased while those from wp have increased by august 26 31 fig 9d this trend continues as contributions from the indian ocean wp further decrease increase these results indicate clear intraseasonal variation in the contributions from each moisture source region with evaporation from land areas dominating the moisture supply to yrb in early summer june 1 10 but decreasing over time while evaporation from oceanic areas increases over time and is the dominant source of moisture for yrb from the third pentad onwards among the oceanic sources the indian ocean contributes more before july 11 while the pacific ocean is the larger oceanic source from july 26 onwards 4 2 the moisture transport paths diagnosis of moisture sources for yrb summer precipitation was presented in the previous section as both the seasonal results and intraseasonal variability are closely associated with the paths of moisture transport in this section we use the tfm to quantitatively analyze the moisture paths 4 2 1 summer mean fig 10 a shows the distribution of ratios of grid cells passed through by yrb end trajectories eq 5 which indicates the paths of water vapor transport to yrb during the whole summer period moisture evaporating from the southern indian ocean crosses the equator and merges with moisture evaporating from the northern indian ocean and the subsequent transport path through indochina the south china sea and south china into yrb is the most intense branch of water vapor transport although cross equatorial flows exist throughout the equatorial indian ocean the strongest branch is located at the western boundary and is associated with water vapor transport by the somali jet from the southern indian ocean to the northern indian ocean wang and xue 2003 joseph and sijikumar 2004 zhou et al 2008 there is a substantial westerly branch of water vapor transport to the south of the tibetan plateau also there are three major branches of water vapor transport over the pacific ocean one in the north pacific entering scs at low latitudes or entering yrb directly from the east one in the equatorial region entering scs along the equator and the other due to the australia cross equatorial flows zhu 2012 li and li 2014 which primarily transports the moisture evaporating from the java sea and the southern pacific ocean into scs abovementioned results suggest that the south china sea plays a very important role in the transport of water vapor to yrb especially for moisture evaporating from oceanic areas to more clearly show the water vapor transport to yrb from the oceanic source regions fig 10b f presents the transport pathways of moisture evaporating from sub regions of the pacific and indian ocean most large portion of the indian pacific oceanic areas provides moisture for yrb precipitation through the scs pass trajectories fig 10b apparently some moisture evaporating from the java sea and the southern pacific ocean appears to be transported to si first and to bb by crossing the equator at the eastern equatorial indian ocean and then be transported to yrb together with the moisture evaporating from bb fig 10c which presents much clearer paths for moisture transport from wp to yrb fig 10c vs a similar patterns fig 10d f indicates that moisture evaporating from the 3 sub regions of the indian ocean is transported to yrb through almost the same trajectories which is probably responsible for the consistent intraseasonal variability of contributions from the 3 sub regions of the indian ocean fig 8c d meanwhile some differences can also be clearly identified for instance there exist differences between fig 10e or 10f and 10d near the east equatorial indian ocean and the north ars and ind the difference over the former area appears to be mainly caused by the cross equatorial flows over the area the difference over the later area indicates that compared to bb pass trajectories considerable ars pass trajectories through more northern areas which may result in a lower ratio of the ars pass trajectories passing through scs in contrast to the ratio of the bb pass trajectories passing through scs the importance of scs for the water vapor transport to yrb has been also noted by previous studies e g simmonds et al 1999 ding and chan 2005 however this importance has not been quantitatively estimated to our knowledge to solve the problem the ratios of scs passed through by the yrb end trajectories eq 6 and the ars bb si and wp pass trajectories eq 8 were calculated the tfm derived values 0 65 0 60 0 73 0 77 and 0 78 respectively indicate that most of the yrb end trajectories and the ars bb si and wp pass trajectories pass through scs confirm the dominant role of scs i e as a path rather than a source for moisture in water vapor transport to yrb 4 2 2 intraseasonal variability due to the importance of scs for the water vapor transport to yrb we first analyze the intraseasonal variations in the ratios of scs passed through by the yrb end trajectories and the ars bb si and wp pass trajectories fig 11 for simplicity we denote the ratios as the yrb ars bb si and wp ratios e g the yrb ratio represents the ratio of scs passed through by the yrb end trajectories several characteristics can be found e g the ars bb and si ratios present consistent intraseasonal variations but the value of ars ratio is lower than those of approximately equivalent bb and si ratios whose patterns are similar fig 10d f scs seems less important for the transport of moisture evaporating from the indian ocean due to the values of the ars bb and si ratios less than 0 5 for the first pentad of the summer and becomes more important with the increase of time for the transport of moisture evaporating from wp scs is very important throughout the summer despite that the wp ratio decreases in later summer another interesting characteristic is that the intraseasonal variation of the yrb ratio is identical with bb ratio before july 21 but identical with wp ratio after august 1 as can be explained by the ratios of bb and wp passed through by the yrb end trajectories the former value is higher than the later before july 21 not shown while fig 11 indicates obvious intraseasonal variability of water vapor transport pathways to yrb fig 12 shows the spatial patterns of the moisture transport pathways to yrb during different pentads throughout the season in early summer fig 12a there are four major branches of water vapor transport branches exist to the south and to the north of the tibetan plateau via which moisture evaporating from the eurasian continent can bypass the tibetan plateau and enter yrb from the west the southern part of these two branches is the most intense of the four branches and even extends to ars some of the moisture evaporating from ars and si is also transported by this branch the third branch extends from ars passes through bb indochina and southwest china and enters yrb from the southwest the fourth branch is located in the north pacific and passes through scs in low latitudes and enters yrb from the south with transported moisture supplemented by moisture evaporating along the branch from scs to southern china because the most intense branch of moisture transport is over land and the branch over the indian ocean i e the third branch does not pass through scs it is understandable that at this stage the yrb ars bb and si ratios are low fig 11 and the percentage contribution from land areas is large figs 7b and 9a by the end of june fig 12b the branch north of the tibetan plateau has essentially disappeared and the branch south of the tibetan plateau is much weaker the indian ocean branch has become the most intense and it extends to the southern indian ocean cross equatorial flows in the indian ocean are stronger especially on the western side of the basin and moisture evaporating from the southern indian ocean crosses the equator and merges with moisture evaporating from the northern indian ocean most part of this moisture then travels through the indochina peninsula scs and south china and enters yrb from the south while little passes through the indochina peninsula and southwest china and enters yrb from the southwest the north pacific branch is strengthened and water vapor continues to enter scs at low latitudes in addition moisture evaporating from the java sea and the south pacific begins to enter scs through cross equatorial flows north of australia the variation in distribution fig 12a b is responsible for the increase in the yrb ars bb and si ratios fig 11 and the decrease increase in percentage contribution from the land areas the indian ocean figs 7b and 9a b in late july fig 12c the branch south of the tibetan plateau has disappeared compared with late june the branch in the indian ocean has become weaker the branch in the north pacific has strengthened further and some moisture evaporating from the north pacific now enters yrb at its eastern boundary which would cause the decrease of the wp ratio during this period fig 11 a new branch of water vapor transport appears in the equatorial pacific ocean and enters scs from the east along the equator additionally the feature can be inferred that the weaker stronger of water vapor transport to yrb from the indian pacific ocean leads to the decrease increase of percentage contribution from the indian pacific ocean figs 7b 9b c similar feature can also be identified from the last pentad of the summer fig 12d during this period the water vapor transport branch in the indian ocean has weakened further a large amount of moisture evaporating from the pacific ocean enters yrb through its eastern boundary which leads to a large decrease of the wp ratio fig 11 and the branch to the north of the tibetan plateau has reappeared 5 discussion 5 1 the moisture sources of precipitation we found that land areas in china and southeast asia the indian ocean the south china sea and the western pacific ocean are the main moisture source regions for summer precipitation over yrb the results are consistent with other recent research e g drumond et al 2011 wei et al 2012 sun and wang 2015 although the studied regions and periods differed among these reports the continental sources contribute 40 2 of moisture for the summer precipitation over yrb which suggests that moisture evaporating from land areas is very important however land areas still contribute less moisture than oceanic areas do the percentage contribution is 57 7 these results differ from those of wei et al 2012 and sun and wang 2015 who found that land areas contribute more moisture than oceanic areas do possible reasons for this discrepancy include i the sink regions used are different the sink regions used in the aforementioned studies are located further westward and fig 6 shows that the west of yrb seems to receive more moisture from land areas ii the periods considered are april september in wei et al 2012 and may september in sun and wang 2015 respectively which are longer than that used in this study june august and include longer period before the arrival and after the withdraw of the summer monsoon in which land areas may be more important fig 7 iii different methods are used wei et al 2012 used the qibt method and sun and wang 2015 used the flexpart model with tracking time of 15 and 10 days respectively and the tracking time in their studies was shorter which would lead to lower total contributions along the derived trajectories e g the total contribution in sun and wang 2015 was 80 5 than those in the present study in addition the calculation of contributions from land and sea areas in this study is more rigorous and iv different data are used as mentioned in wei et al 2012 the evapotranspiration in their study is higher over land jiménez et al 2011 and lower over ocean bosilovich et al 2011 compared with other reanalysis we also found that si contributes more moisture than the well known ars or bb does however as a moisture source for yrb si has been overlooked in previous studies probably because si is so far away from yrb that the tracking time generally used in the quantitative studies e g wei et al 2012 sun and wang 2015 is relatively short for the region it should be noted that this result is consistent with previous studies which investigated the relationship between the yrb summer precipitation and the somali jet e g wang and xue 2003 wang and yang 2014 dai and xiao 2015 and indicated the crucial role of the somali jet in transporting moisture from si to the north hemisphere in boreal summer wang and xue 2003 zhu 2012 jiang et al 2016 we suggest that the important contribution from si is reasonable due to the reasons as follows i si has relatively low precipitation but high evaporation not shown in boreal summer which implies that most of the evaporated moisture would be transported to the north indian ocean by the prevailing wind i e the cross equatorial flows and then to yrb together with moisture evaporated from ars and bb and ii though the grid cell contributions over si are generally lower than those over ars or bb fig 4 the summation of grid cell contributions of si could be larger than that of ars or bb fig 5 due to the much larger area of si fig 1 5 2 the moisture transport paths 5 2 1 the trajectory frequency method the tfm is proposed to quantitatively and objectively diagnose the moisture transport paths to yrb by dealing with the trajectories obtained from the modified drm dominguez et al 2006 martinez and dominguez 2014 which is used to quantify moisture sources for yrb summer precipitation in this study the results derived from the tfm eq 5 figs 10a and 12 and the drm figs 4 and 9 show consistent tendencies in variation and quite similar spatial patterns with some differences especially in the regions far away from yrb e g the eastern pacific oceans the drm derived percentage contribution is determined by the local collection of moisture from each grid cell and how much it would lose during the transport process along the trajectory martinez and dominguez 2014 which is a combination of trajectory information and local moisture conditions i e evaporation and precipitable water over each grid cell along the trajectory from the grid cell to the sink region the tfm derived result is fully determined by the trajectories eq 5 which means that all of the grid cells passed through by a trajectory have the same weight no matter how far away the grid cells are from the sink region and that each trajectory has the same weight no matter how much moisture a trajectory could carry in this context the tfm only presents the information of moisture transport paths that are derived from the drm results which helps to reveal the dominant circulation pattern therefore the trajectory information in both the drm and tfm derived results is responsible for their similarities i e between the drm derived percentage contribution and the eq 5 ratio of tfm while the local moisture conditions along the trajectories lead to the spatial differences between drm and tfm in particular most of the moisture evaporated from the regions far away from the sink region would lose gradually during the transport process to approach the sink region which greatly influences the percentage contributions in moisture amount from the source regions however the tfm derived results are not influenced by the local moisture conditions along the trajectories consequently in the regions farther away from yrb i e the sink region the spatial differences between drm and tfm are more obvious it is suggested that by dealing with the trajectories the tfm can serve as a diagnosis method for the tracked trajectories by corresponding methods or models e g drm different from the other methods used to deal with the trajectories such as the commonly used cluster analysis e g moody and galloway 1988 dorling et al 1992 tfm is a method intended to describe the paths with the frequency nature over various areas and can be regarded as a more objective method for natural clustering although there are a number of methods for cluster analysis they have been little if any use for a single region of moisture source eq 7 in particular tfm is capable of quantitatively estimating the relative importance of a given region e g scs in this study in the transport of moisture evaporating from upstream source regions eqs 6 8 in this context the relative importance of particular pathways can be assessed by the tfm e g the pathways through scs in the present study thus the method offers a new perspective on the analysis of moisture paths as the trajectories are the foundation of the tfm the tfm must be used together with the drm or the other lagrangian methods such as qibt dirmeyer and brubaker 1999 flexpart stohl and james 2004 2005 and 3d t tuinenburg et al 2012 although care must be taken when calculating trajectories in 3 d space 5 2 2 association with the asian summer monsoon as introduced in section 1 the moisture supply for yrb summer precipitation is closely related to the asian summer monsoon which includes the ism and easm ding and chan 2005 to reveal the association between the moisture transport process to yrb and the asian summer monsoon fig 13 presents the moisuture weighted vertically integrated wind fields in a relatively small region which shows more detailed information compared with fig 12 and the 500 hpa geopotential height at different pentads throughout the summer season in early summer fig 13a wpsh is over scs and yrb is dominated by westerly flow which corresponds to the intense moisture transport branch south to the tibetan plateau fig 12a the intense moisture transport from oceans can only reach the northwestern margin of wpsh i e south china which corresponds to the last phase of the so called pre summer rainy season in south china with the ending time in the first 10 day period of june ding and chan 2005 by the end of june fig 13b wpsh has northward shifted and exists over the southeast side of yrb which leads to stronger moisture transport from wp fig 12b compared to early summer fig 12a the ism has begun wang and lin 2002 prasad and hayashi 2005 and yrb is dominated by southernly flow from oceanic areas which corresponds to the intense moisture transport from the indian ocean fig 12b with the period generally known as the meiyu rainy season in yrb ding 2004 ge et al 2008 in late july fig 13c the wpsh is more westward and northward compared to late june fig 13b which would enhance the moisture transport from wp fig 12c though the wind field seems to be almost the same as in fig 13b the difference field not shown shows that ism has weakened which coincides with the weakened moisture transport from the indian ocean fig 12c compared to late june fig 12b by the end of summer fig 13d wpsh is slightly more northward compared to late july fig 13c and has retreated to the east side of yrb with almost at the same latitudes as yrb and the southeastly flow along the south margin of wpsh carries a large amount of moisture from wp that enters yrb from the east side which agrees with the variation of the moisture sources fig 9d and paths fig 12d the southwestly flow over yrb and south china seems to have disappeared and ism has withdrawn from china ding 2007 as a result the moisture transport branch over the indian ocean weakens fig 12d and the contribution from the indian ocean decreases figs 7b 9d 6 conclusion we utilized high temporal and spatial resolution cfsr reanalysis data and station precipitation observations in the mid lower reaches of the yangtze river basin over an extended period 1979 2010 to quantitatively analyze the sources of moisture for summer june 1 august 31 precipitation over yrb using the modified drm dominguez et al 2006 martinez and dominguez 2014 we have also quantitatively diagnosed the pathways for moisture transport from source regions to yrb using a newly developed trajectory frequency method tfm by dealing with the moisture transport paths for yrb the tfm serves as a diagnosis method in terms of pathway frequency for the tracked trajectories provided by drm or other corresponding models the main conclusions are as follows i in the summer land areas in china and southeast asia the indian ocean the south china sea and the western pacific ocean are found to be the main moisture source regions for precipitation over yrb the total land areas the indian ocean and the pacific ocean contribute 40 2 29 9 and 27 6 of the moisture for summer precipitation over yrb respectively which indicates that the contribution of terrestrial evapotranspiration is important but less important than the contribution of oceanic evaporation the contribution from si 12 9 which has been overlooked in previous studies is larger than that from either ars 7 4 or bb 9 6 ii averaged over the whole summer period with tfm the branch of water vapor transport stretching from the arabian sea through the bay of bengal the indochina peninsula south china sea and over south china is the most intense vapor transport pathway other main paths include the westerly flow south to the tibetan plateau the branch in the northern west pacific ocean the easterly flow in the equatorial pacific ocean and the australia cross equatorial flow iii the percentage contribution from land areas is over 50 in the early summer and then decreases to less than 40 after late june the indian ocean is the most important oceanic source before mid july with its largest contribution during the period of heavy precipitation while the pacific ocean becomes the more important oceanic source after mid july all of these are closely associated with the similar intraseasonal variabilities in moisture sources and moisture transport paths which is caused by the changes in the asian monsoon dynamics including wpsh activities as qualitatively summarized in fig 14 iv except for early summer the south china sea is very important for water vapor transport to yrb because most of the moisture evaporated from other oceanic sources is transported into yrb passing through the south china sea as quantitatively indicated by the tfm results acknowledgments this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant nos 41675007 and 41475063

7383,using a moisture tracking model with 32 year reanalysis data and station precipitation observations we diagnosed the sources of moisture for summer june 1 august 31 precipitation in mid lower reaches of the yangtze river basin yrb results indicate the dominant role of oceanic evaporation compared to terrestrial evapotranspiration and the previously overlooked southern indian ocean as a source region is found to contribute more moisture than the well known arabian sea or bay of bengal terrestrial evapotranspiration appears to be important for summer precipitation especially in early june when moisture contribution is more than 50 the terrestrial contribution then decreases and is generally less than 40 after late june the indian ocean is the most important oceanic source before mid july with its largest contribution during the period of heavy precipitation while the pacific ocean becomes the more important oceanic source after mid july to quantitatively analyze paths of moisture transport to yrb we proposed the trajectory frequency method the most intense branch of water vapor transport to yrb stretches from the arabian sea through the bay of bengal the indochina peninsula the south china sea and south china the other main transport branches are westerly moisture fluxes to the south of the tibetan plateau cross equatorial flows north of australia and separate branches located in the north and equatorial pacific ocean significant intraseasonal variability for these branches is presented additionally the importance of the south china sea for moisture transport to yrb especially from the sea areas is emphasized keywords quantitative diagnosis mid lower yangtze river basin summer precipitation moisture sources moisture paths 1 introduction the mid lower reaches of the yangtze river basin yrb is one of the most densely populated regions in the world ge and feng 2010 wei et al 2012 and one of the most economically developed regions in china huang et al 2013 however in summer when precipitation accounts for 40 50 of the annual amount zhou et al 2009 this region has been threatened frequently by severe floods zeng et al 2016 e g the 1998 flood caused about 4000 deaths and 26 billion in economic losses wei et al 2012 floods are primarily caused by heavy precipitation wei et al 2012 which is directly related to sufficient water vapor and its transport process huang et al 2004 trenberth 2011 sun and wang 2014b knowledge about the atmospheric water transport process is important for assessing and managing water resources martinez and dominguez 2014 and may improve the predictive skill of numerical models and also help design the observational network in the upstream region which could benefit heavy precipitation forecasts chen et al 2013 therefore it is important to understand where the moisture may originate i e moisture sources dirmeyer and brubaker 1999 guo and wang 2014 and how it is transported to sink regions i e moisture transport pathways zhou et al 2008 e g yrb the origin of water vapor over yrb has been studied extensively using a range of methods it is well known that yrb is a typical monsoon area wang and lin 2002 ding and chan 2005 the moisture supply for yrb is largely influenced by southerly winds which are controlled by the indian summer monsoon ism and the east asian summer monsoon easm and bring substantial moisture from the indian ocean and from the western pacific along the west margin of the western pacific subtropical high wpsh in summer xue et al 2003 wang and chen 2012 sun and wang 2015 zeng et al 2017 consequently many previous studies have highlighted the importance of oceanic sources for summer precipitation over yrb some early works suggested that the bay of bengal the south china sea and the western pacific are the main moisture sources for yrb summer precipitation using the method of calculating water vapor flux e g simmonds et al 1999 zhou and yu 2005 he et al 2007 zhou et al 2008 xu et al 2008 argued that the low latitude band from the bayof bengal to the philippines is the dominant moisture source region for yrb summer precipitation using the method of correlation analysis based on the information along trajectories from a particle dispersion model flexpart stohl and james 2004 2005 proposed a method to identify moisture sources for precipitation using this method chen et al 2013 identified the east china sea south china sea indian peninsula and the bay of bengal and arabian sea as four major moisture sources for yrb summer water vapor however several studies have indicated the importance of terrestrial sources for yrb summer precipitation for example van der ent et al 2010 found that the moisture evaporating from the eurasian continent contributed most water vapor to annual precipitation over china when studying the origin of atmospheric moisture over global continents based on a method termed the water accounting model using a lagrangian method called the quasi isentropic back trajectory qibt method dirmeyer and brubaker 1999 2007 brubaker et al 2001 wei et al 2012 explored the sources of water vapor for wet season precipitation over yrb and found that the major direct moisture sources are yrb itself and the associated over land moisture transport pathways other important moisture sources include the bay of bengal the indochina peninsula the south china sea and the western north pacific ocean with the flexpart model drumond et al 2011 found that the moisture evaporating from land areas is important for summer precipitation over yrb and sun and wang 2015 found that evapotranspiration over land seems to be the dominant source of moisture for summer precipitation in yrb while the evaporation over the western pacific follows in a quantitative study the aforementioned results indicated that knowledge about the moisture sources for yrb summer precipitation has not reached a consensus in addition to the differences in data and study region the drawbacks of methods used in previous studies could limit the identification of exact moisture sources and may contribute more to the differences in their results as indicated by wei et al 2012 the method of calculating water vapor flux is difficult to identify moisture sources and sinks and simple correlation analysis is difficult to generate convincing conclusions the qibt method uses quasi isentropic tracking which may lead to limitations when diabatic process is important and assumes that evaporation can contribute to the moisture increase along trajectories that are above the boundary layer sodemann et al 2008 the method based on flexpart however cannot clearly separate evaporation and precipitation gimeno et al 2012 therefore the identification of moisture sources for yrb summer precipitation may be obtained using other effective methods such as the modified dynamic recycling model drm dominguez et al 2006 martinez and dominguez 2014 the drm which is directly derived from the vertically integrated balance equation for water vapor was initially proposed by dominguez et al 2006 for the study of precipitation recycling dominguez and kumar 2008 dominguez et al 2008 and has been used to study local precipitation recycling in regions in china hua et al 2015 2016 martinez and dominguez 2014 subsequently modified the drm to study the moisture sources for precipitation over the la plata river basin compared with the aforementioned qibt dirmeyer and brubaker 1999 2007 brubaker et al 2001 and flexpart stohl and james 2004 2005 nieto et al 2014 the drm is computationally much less demanding hu and dominguez 2015 another significant advantage of the drm is that it is valid at the daily timescale as it explicitly includes temporal changes in moisture storage bisselink and dolman 2008 which were neglected in previous precipitation recycling models budyko 1974 brubaker et al 1993 eltahir and bras 1994 making them valid only at monthly or longer timescales however the drm assumes a well mixed atmosphere which neglects some physical and dynamic processes in the atmosphere and may cause errors in regions with strong vertical wind shear or otherwise incomplete vertical mixing goessling and reick 2013 despite this possible limitation the drm has been shown to produce good results when used to study moisture sources over the south american continent hoyos et al 2017 and it has also been applied successfully to the north american monsoon region hu and dominguez 2015 additionally it has been indicated that the well mixed assumption applies better over yrb than over the south american continent or the north american monsoon region and the vertical shear condition over yrb is similar to those over the south american continent and the north american monsoon region e g figs 3 and 4 by goessling and reick 2013 and fig 11 by van der ent et al 2013 these results provide confidence that the drm can be used as a proper method to study moisture sources for summer precipitation over yrb whereas a variety of methods have been used to study moisture sources somewhat fewer methods are available to study water vapor transport paths stohl and james 2004 and dominguez et al 2008 used the method of listing part of trajectories to diagnose moisture transport pathways however presenting the trajectories is an intuitive method which is not directly and numerically quantified and would make the interpretation of the results more dependent on users to some extent thus it is necessary to quantitatively deal with the large number of trajectories after obtaining them with various tracking methods currently a commonly used method to quantitatively diagnose water vapor transport pathways e g sodemann et al 2008 sun and wang 2014a huang and cui 2015 is cluster analysis e g moody and galloway 1988 dorling et al 1992 however this approach is somewhat subjective as it involves grouping a large number of vapor trajectories into an arbitrary number of clusters david et al 2010 li et al 2016 li et al 2016 used a circulation constrained method by grouping trajectories into several predefined categories based on the general circulation feature and particle positions along the trajectories which did not show the complete moisture transport paths and could overlook some detailed characteristics of moisture transport therefore it is necessary to develop new methods that account for all trajectories to diagnose water vapor transport pathways both quantitatively and objectively in this paper our objectives are i to quantitatively estimate the sources of moisture for summer precipitation over yrb using the modified drm dominguez et al 2006 martinez and dominguez 2014 and ii to quantitatively diagnose water vapor transport pathways using a newly developed method hence after the description for study site and materials section 2 these objectives provide the structural sub headings used in the following methods section 3 results section 4 and discussion section 5 sections 2 study site and materials 2 1 study site in this study the sink region we chose is the mid lower reaches of the yangtze river basin i e yrb in fig 1 which is the same as that in xu et al 2008 located in east china yrb is a typical east asian monsoon region and characterized by the meiyu front in summer e g ge et al 2008 jiang et al 2009 ding et al 2010 though we chose yrb as the sink region the potential source area fig 1 encompasses most of the eurasian continent the indian ocean and the pacific ocean which is large enough to ensure that the relative contribution from evaporation along the trajectory to precipitation in the sink region is close to 1 the total source area is divided into 16 sub regions fig 1 based on the results of previous studies e g wei et al 2012 sun and wang 2015 and large scale geography of these regions chosen 7 sub regions are land based and 9 are oceanic regions 3 of the 9 oceanic regions are part of the indian ocean 5 are part of the pacific ocean and another 1 oceanic region is the residual sea portion of the total source area 2 2 materials 2 2 1 the reanalysis data we use data from the 32 year 1979 2010 6 h resolution climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr from the national centers for environmental prediction ncep https rda ucar edu datasets ds093 0 which is a third generation reanalysis product that provides a very good estimate of a global land ocean atmosphere coupled system at high spatiotemporal resolution and over an extended period saha et al 2010 geophysical fields used in this study include latent heat flux surface pressure precipitation zonal and meridional wind speeds and specific humidity the atmospheric data zonal and meridional wind speeds and specific humidity are available on a 0 5 0 5 horizontal grid with 37 pressure levels from 1000 to 1 hpa but here we only use data from the lowest 23 levels from 1000 to 200 hpa precipitation data are provided at the same horizontal resolution latent heat flux and surface pressure data are provided at a higher resolution of 0 3125 but are bilinearly interpolated onto the same 0 5 grid for this analysis zonal and meridional wind speeds specific humidity and surface pressure were used to calculate precipitable water and moisture weighted zonal and meridional wind fields latent heat flux was used to calculate total evapotranspiration which is not provided explicitly by cfsr lorenz and kunstmann 2012 according to the classification of kalnay et al 1996 zonal and meridional wind are type a variables that is data are reliable as they are strongly constrained by observations specific humidity is a type b variable and we consider it also to be reliable as it is influenced by both the model and observations actual evapotranspiration and precipitation are type c variables which are determined entirely by model physics for catchments where there is limited preferable no inter basin water transfer and limited water regulation the long term actual evapotranspiration can be validated against the result of long term i e at least 10 years precipitation minus streamflow donohue et al 2007 liu et al 2016 yang et al 2016 for regions that are not the catchments in hydrology e g potential moisture source areas in this study fig 1 the method for evaporation validation using precipitation minus runoff is not applicable the validity of precipitation can however be estimated through comparison with observational data 2 2 2 correction of the cfsr precipitation we compared cfsr precipitation with observations from 86 stations http data cma cn in yrb and found significant differences in both temporal evolution and spatial distributions fig 2 cfsr precipitation is overestimated from late june onwards and the spatial distribution is quite different from that of the observation stations the pattern correlation coefficient is 0 52 though these differences may have only a small impact on the recycling ratio dominguez et al 2006 they do affect the amount of precipitation that is contributed by each source region therefore we corrected the cfsr 6 hourly precipitation by the following steps i daily precipitation from 86 stations in yrb and the surrounding area were interpolated onto the 0 5 grid using the barnes scheme barnes 1964 to obtain grid observational data ii the cfsr 6 hourly precipitation on each grid in yrb was aggregated to daily precipitation and iii the 6 hourly cfsr precipitation was corrected by multiplying the ratio of daily observational precipitation to the cfsr precipitation the mean time series of the corrected cfsr precipitation is highly consistent with the station precipitation series fig 2a indicating that the correction is reasonable 3 methods 3 1 the moisture sources of precipitation the modified drm dominguez et al 2006 martinez and dominguez 2014 was used to calculate the moisture sources of precipitation in this study in the drm the vertically integrated balance equation for water vapor is resolved by applying a semi lagrangian scheme and the recycling ratio is expressed as 1 r χ ξ τ 1 exp 0 τ ε χ ξ τ ω χ ξ τ τ where χ ξ and τ represent the x y and t dimensions respectively and r ε and ω are the recycling ratio evapotranspiration and precipitable water respectively in the semi lagrangian coordinate system χ ξ τ in the modified drm martinez and dominguez 2014 the recycling ratio for a large domain was decomposed into moisture contributions from several sub regions thus it can be used to quantify the relative contributions from different sources to the atmospheric moisture over a given sink region we implemented a tracking algorithm for each grid point in the sink region every 6 h to coincide with the cfsr resolution each tracking algorithm was stopped when the tracking time was longer than 40 days or the trajectory was out of the source area as shown in fig 1 as described by martinez and dominguez 2014 the value of a k i j t which represents the contribution from the source region a k to the moisture at point i j was calculated the averaged precipitation over a chosen period e g one day p m a k a s over the sink region a s i e yrb in this study contributed by the source region a k can be expressed as 2 p m a k a s t i j a s p i j t a k i j t δ a i j i j a s δ a i j where p i j t is the 6 hourly precipitation at grid point i j and δ a i j is the area of the cell centered at i j the averaged precipitation p a s over the sink region a s can be calculated as 3 p a s t i j a s p i j t δ a i j i j a s δ a i j therefore the ratio of the contribution from moisture evaporating from the source region a k to precipitation over the sink region a s can be expressed as 4 r a k a s p m a k a s p a s throughout this paper we refer to p m a k a s as the amount contribution hu and dominguez 2015 and to r a k a s multiplied by 100 as the percentage contribution it should be noted that both a source region a k and a sink region a s can represent either a larger region or a single grid cell within the 0 5 0 5 mesh 3 2 the moisture transport paths to evaluate both quantitatively and objectively the pathways of water vapor transport into a given area e g yrb we propose a method utilizing the density frequency of moisture trajectories termed the trajectory frequency method tfm which is described below as the drm calculates the moisture sources of precipitation by the lagrangian tracking e g martinez and dominguez 2014 the exact location within a certain grid cell for a moisture parcel can be recorded at each time step and then a trajectory could be obtained after a tracking for each grid cell with a precipitation event during a tracking interval e g in agreement with the interval of the cfsr data 6 hourly trackings were performed throughout june august in the present study at each time step of tracking i e the 6 hourly interval here the numbers of trajectories on each grid cell were recorded and accumulated if there exist n a s trajectories that arrive on the sink region a s during a specific period e g one day each passing through different grid cells then if a grid cell i j has n i j a s trajectories passing through it the ratio of grid cell i j passed through by the total trajectories could be calculated as 5 r f i j a s n i j a s n a s fig 3 a shows a schematic of the calculation of r f i j a s by using the r f i j a s parameter large numbers of trajectories are reduced to a 2 d dimensionless frequency distribution which presents as compared to above mentioned method for moisture paths more quantitative and detailed information during water vapor transport along the trajectories similar to a grid cell the ratio of a certain region a k passed through by the total trajectories could also be expressed as 6 r f a k a s n a k a s n a s where n a k a s represents the number of trajectories that pass through the region a k among the n a s trajectories fig 3b we refer to the n a s trajectories end in the moisture sink region a s as the a s end i e yrb end in this study trajectories and the n a k a s trajectories that pass through the region a k as the a k pass e g scs pass trajectories in this paper this ratio in eq 6 reflects the importance of the region a k for the water vapor transport to the sink region a s a higher ratio indicates a k is more important for the water vapor transport to a s e g if the ratio is close to 1 it could be concluded that a k is the dominant area with the most moisture transport pathways when considering the a k pass trajectories as the total trajectories two ratios similar to those in eqs 5 and 6 could be obtained as 7 r f i j a k n i j a k n a k a s and 8 r f a l a k n a l a k n a k a s where n i j a k n a l a k is the number of trajectories that pass through grid cell i j region a l with the location in the downstream of a k among the n a k a s a k pass trajectories note that n a l a k is not the summation of n i j a k over the grid cells in a particular region e g if one trajectory passes through many grid cells over the region n a l a k 1 as eq 7 only involves the a k pass trajectories the 2 d distribution of r f i j a k specifically reflects both the paths of water vapor transport to the sink region a s from source region a k and the source regions these source regions are upstream for a k and also provide evaporated moisture for precipitation in the sink region a s through the a k pass trajectories notably the 2 d distribution of r f i j a s also includes the path information of water vapor transport from a k but reflects the moisture transport paths to the sink region from a k less clearly than the distribution of r f i j a k the value of r f a l a k could be used to reflect the importance of region a l for the transport of moisture evaporating from the source region a k to the sink region a s fig 3b the tfm can quantitatively record information from numerous calculated trajectories using the ratios of trajectories passing through a grid cell or region i e eqs 5 and 7 for individual grid cells and eqs 6 and 8 for regions it is noteworthy that the drm derived percentage contributions denote the contribution of evaporation to precipitation while the tfm derived ratios represent the dominant water vapor transport pathways and could also be a supplementary parameter for hydrological cycling 4 results 4 1 the moisture sources of precipitation in this section the modified drm dominguez et al 2006 martinez and dominguez 2014 is used to quantitatively diagnose the sources of moisture for summer precipitation over yrb 4 1 1 summer mean 4 1 1 1 grid cell evaporation contributions to yrb precipitation fig 4 shows the distribution of percentage contributions from each grid cell to summer precipitation over yrb the precipitationsheds i e the upwind atmosphere and surface that contributes evaporation to a specific region s precipitation keys et al 2012 were calculated using the method similar to that by van der ent and savenije 2013 at 70 black dots and 90 black and grey dots thresholds similar to the result of wei et al 2012 the major moisture sources are located to the southwest of yrb and large contributions come from yrb itself and surrounding land areas the indochina peninsula the south china sea the western pacific and the indian ocean are also important source regions 4 1 1 2 source region evaporation contributions to yrb precipitation the percentage contributions of the 16 sub regions to yrb summer precipitation are shown in fig 5 yrb chi sea ars bb si scs and wp are clearly the main sources of moisture for summer precipitation over yrb these eight sources contribute 90 of the moisture for summer precipitation over yrb among them chi contributes the most moisture 18 1 followed by wp 14 6 and ars contributes the least 7 4 the percentage contribution from yrb i e the recycling ratio is 9 similar to the contributions from sea bb and scs it is surprising that though the percentage contributions from si grid cells are much lower than those in ars or bb fig 4 the percentage contribution from si is as much as 12 9 which is larger than that from ars or bb the combined contributions from land areas the indian ocean and the pacific ocean were also calculated the percentage contribution from land areas is 40 2 which similar to the result 41 8 of sun and wang 2015 the contribution from sea areas is 57 7 and contributions from the indian and pacific oceans are 29 9 and 27 6 respectively 4 1 1 3 source region evaporation contributions to precipitation of grid cells within yrb we next analyze contributions from the eight key moisture source regions to summer precipitation in individual grid cells in yrb as shown in fig 6 the distributions of the contributions from the eight major moisture source regions show large scale gradients but the directions of strongest variability are different the largest contributions from yrb itself are to the northeast corner of the yrb region while the contributions to the south and west areas of yrb are lower this is primarily a result of the directionality imparted by the summer monsoon the contributions from chi decrease from northwest to southeast while the contributions from scs and wp decrease from southeast to northwest the contributions from sea ars bb and si all decrease from southwest to northeast the distributions of contributions from external sources fig 6b h are generally a result of how moisture from these sources penetrate into yrb e g moisture from sea ars bb and si would mainly flow into yrb from the southwest as the percentage contributions decrease along downwind directions with a larger loss of moisture due to the precipitation process along a longer trajectory 4 1 2 intraseasonal variability the summer season june 1 to august 31 is now divided into 18 pentads to analyze the intraseasonal variability of the contributions from different source regions the 12th and 18th pentads are actually 6 days in length to account for the total of 31 days in july and august respectively the amount and percentage contributions from land areas the indian ocean and the pacific ocean and sub regions within throughout the summer season are shown in figs 7 and 8 fig 7 highlights the importance of terrestrial moisture for summer precipitation over yrb especially in early june when the percentage contribution from land areas exceeds 50 however the relative importance of land areas gradually decreases to percentage contributions of 35 40 in late june as the increase in the amount contribution from land does not keep pace with the increase in yrb precipitation the seesaw relationship between contributions from the indian ocean and the pacific ocean can also be seen in fig 7 which well corresponds to the same relationship between the contributions from bb and wp which was identified by wei et al 2012 the indian ocean is the more important oceanic source before july 11 especially during the period of heavy precipitation while the pacific ocean becomes more important from july 26 the two oceans contribute similar amounts of moisture between july 11 and july 25 chi is the most important source among land sub regions fig 8a and b accounting for around half of the total land contribution throughout summer similar to wei et al 2012 the contribution from yrb the recycling ratio is lower during the period of intense precipitation the contributions from the three sub regions of the indian ocean fig 8c and d show almost identical intraseasonal variation the contribution from si ars is the largest smallest among the three sub regions while the contribution from bb is intermediate throughout summer with the exception of the first pentad the percentage contribution from si increases faster than that of ars or bb in june when the percentage contribution from the indian ocean as a whole is increasing fig 8e and f show the temporal evolution of the contributions from the two main sub regions of the pacific ocean and through comparison with fig 7 it can be seen that the amount contribution from scs closely follows the total yrb precipitation the percentage contribution from scs remains steady at around 10 after june 21 during which temporal variability in the pacific ocean contribution comes mainly from wp in august wp becomes the most important of the eight sources probably due to the northeastward movement of wpsh and the landfall of typhoons ren et al 2002 su and xue 2010 wei et al 2012 the intraseasonal variability can be also found in contributions from each grid cell fig 9 during june 1 5 fig 9a the largest contributions are from yrb and land areas to the southwest while the contributions from oceanic areas particularly wp are lower by june 26 30 fig 9b contributions from grid cells over land have decreased substantially while the contributions from oceanic areas have increased especially in the indian ocean later during july 21 25 fig 9c the most notable feature is that the contributions from grid cells in the indian ocean have decreased while those from wp have increased by august 26 31 fig 9d this trend continues as contributions from the indian ocean wp further decrease increase these results indicate clear intraseasonal variation in the contributions from each moisture source region with evaporation from land areas dominating the moisture supply to yrb in early summer june 1 10 but decreasing over time while evaporation from oceanic areas increases over time and is the dominant source of moisture for yrb from the third pentad onwards among the oceanic sources the indian ocean contributes more before july 11 while the pacific ocean is the larger oceanic source from july 26 onwards 4 2 the moisture transport paths diagnosis of moisture sources for yrb summer precipitation was presented in the previous section as both the seasonal results and intraseasonal variability are closely associated with the paths of moisture transport in this section we use the tfm to quantitatively analyze the moisture paths 4 2 1 summer mean fig 10 a shows the distribution of ratios of grid cells passed through by yrb end trajectories eq 5 which indicates the paths of water vapor transport to yrb during the whole summer period moisture evaporating from the southern indian ocean crosses the equator and merges with moisture evaporating from the northern indian ocean and the subsequent transport path through indochina the south china sea and south china into yrb is the most intense branch of water vapor transport although cross equatorial flows exist throughout the equatorial indian ocean the strongest branch is located at the western boundary and is associated with water vapor transport by the somali jet from the southern indian ocean to the northern indian ocean wang and xue 2003 joseph and sijikumar 2004 zhou et al 2008 there is a substantial westerly branch of water vapor transport to the south of the tibetan plateau also there are three major branches of water vapor transport over the pacific ocean one in the north pacific entering scs at low latitudes or entering yrb directly from the east one in the equatorial region entering scs along the equator and the other due to the australia cross equatorial flows zhu 2012 li and li 2014 which primarily transports the moisture evaporating from the java sea and the southern pacific ocean into scs abovementioned results suggest that the south china sea plays a very important role in the transport of water vapor to yrb especially for moisture evaporating from oceanic areas to more clearly show the water vapor transport to yrb from the oceanic source regions fig 10b f presents the transport pathways of moisture evaporating from sub regions of the pacific and indian ocean most large portion of the indian pacific oceanic areas provides moisture for yrb precipitation through the scs pass trajectories fig 10b apparently some moisture evaporating from the java sea and the southern pacific ocean appears to be transported to si first and to bb by crossing the equator at the eastern equatorial indian ocean and then be transported to yrb together with the moisture evaporating from bb fig 10c which presents much clearer paths for moisture transport from wp to yrb fig 10c vs a similar patterns fig 10d f indicates that moisture evaporating from the 3 sub regions of the indian ocean is transported to yrb through almost the same trajectories which is probably responsible for the consistent intraseasonal variability of contributions from the 3 sub regions of the indian ocean fig 8c d meanwhile some differences can also be clearly identified for instance there exist differences between fig 10e or 10f and 10d near the east equatorial indian ocean and the north ars and ind the difference over the former area appears to be mainly caused by the cross equatorial flows over the area the difference over the later area indicates that compared to bb pass trajectories considerable ars pass trajectories through more northern areas which may result in a lower ratio of the ars pass trajectories passing through scs in contrast to the ratio of the bb pass trajectories passing through scs the importance of scs for the water vapor transport to yrb has been also noted by previous studies e g simmonds et al 1999 ding and chan 2005 however this importance has not been quantitatively estimated to our knowledge to solve the problem the ratios of scs passed through by the yrb end trajectories eq 6 and the ars bb si and wp pass trajectories eq 8 were calculated the tfm derived values 0 65 0 60 0 73 0 77 and 0 78 respectively indicate that most of the yrb end trajectories and the ars bb si and wp pass trajectories pass through scs confirm the dominant role of scs i e as a path rather than a source for moisture in water vapor transport to yrb 4 2 2 intraseasonal variability due to the importance of scs for the water vapor transport to yrb we first analyze the intraseasonal variations in the ratios of scs passed through by the yrb end trajectories and the ars bb si and wp pass trajectories fig 11 for simplicity we denote the ratios as the yrb ars bb si and wp ratios e g the yrb ratio represents the ratio of scs passed through by the yrb end trajectories several characteristics can be found e g the ars bb and si ratios present consistent intraseasonal variations but the value of ars ratio is lower than those of approximately equivalent bb and si ratios whose patterns are similar fig 10d f scs seems less important for the transport of moisture evaporating from the indian ocean due to the values of the ars bb and si ratios less than 0 5 for the first pentad of the summer and becomes more important with the increase of time for the transport of moisture evaporating from wp scs is very important throughout the summer despite that the wp ratio decreases in later summer another interesting characteristic is that the intraseasonal variation of the yrb ratio is identical with bb ratio before july 21 but identical with wp ratio after august 1 as can be explained by the ratios of bb and wp passed through by the yrb end trajectories the former value is higher than the later before july 21 not shown while fig 11 indicates obvious intraseasonal variability of water vapor transport pathways to yrb fig 12 shows the spatial patterns of the moisture transport pathways to yrb during different pentads throughout the season in early summer fig 12a there are four major branches of water vapor transport branches exist to the south and to the north of the tibetan plateau via which moisture evaporating from the eurasian continent can bypass the tibetan plateau and enter yrb from the west the southern part of these two branches is the most intense of the four branches and even extends to ars some of the moisture evaporating from ars and si is also transported by this branch the third branch extends from ars passes through bb indochina and southwest china and enters yrb from the southwest the fourth branch is located in the north pacific and passes through scs in low latitudes and enters yrb from the south with transported moisture supplemented by moisture evaporating along the branch from scs to southern china because the most intense branch of moisture transport is over land and the branch over the indian ocean i e the third branch does not pass through scs it is understandable that at this stage the yrb ars bb and si ratios are low fig 11 and the percentage contribution from land areas is large figs 7b and 9a by the end of june fig 12b the branch north of the tibetan plateau has essentially disappeared and the branch south of the tibetan plateau is much weaker the indian ocean branch has become the most intense and it extends to the southern indian ocean cross equatorial flows in the indian ocean are stronger especially on the western side of the basin and moisture evaporating from the southern indian ocean crosses the equator and merges with moisture evaporating from the northern indian ocean most part of this moisture then travels through the indochina peninsula scs and south china and enters yrb from the south while little passes through the indochina peninsula and southwest china and enters yrb from the southwest the north pacific branch is strengthened and water vapor continues to enter scs at low latitudes in addition moisture evaporating from the java sea and the south pacific begins to enter scs through cross equatorial flows north of australia the variation in distribution fig 12a b is responsible for the increase in the yrb ars bb and si ratios fig 11 and the decrease increase in percentage contribution from the land areas the indian ocean figs 7b and 9a b in late july fig 12c the branch south of the tibetan plateau has disappeared compared with late june the branch in the indian ocean has become weaker the branch in the north pacific has strengthened further and some moisture evaporating from the north pacific now enters yrb at its eastern boundary which would cause the decrease of the wp ratio during this period fig 11 a new branch of water vapor transport appears in the equatorial pacific ocean and enters scs from the east along the equator additionally the feature can be inferred that the weaker stronger of water vapor transport to yrb from the indian pacific ocean leads to the decrease increase of percentage contribution from the indian pacific ocean figs 7b 9b c similar feature can also be identified from the last pentad of the summer fig 12d during this period the water vapor transport branch in the indian ocean has weakened further a large amount of moisture evaporating from the pacific ocean enters yrb through its eastern boundary which leads to a large decrease of the wp ratio fig 11 and the branch to the north of the tibetan plateau has reappeared 5 discussion 5 1 the moisture sources of precipitation we found that land areas in china and southeast asia the indian ocean the south china sea and the western pacific ocean are the main moisture source regions for summer precipitation over yrb the results are consistent with other recent research e g drumond et al 2011 wei et al 2012 sun and wang 2015 although the studied regions and periods differed among these reports the continental sources contribute 40 2 of moisture for the summer precipitation over yrb which suggests that moisture evaporating from land areas is very important however land areas still contribute less moisture than oceanic areas do the percentage contribution is 57 7 these results differ from those of wei et al 2012 and sun and wang 2015 who found that land areas contribute more moisture than oceanic areas do possible reasons for this discrepancy include i the sink regions used are different the sink regions used in the aforementioned studies are located further westward and fig 6 shows that the west of yrb seems to receive more moisture from land areas ii the periods considered are april september in wei et al 2012 and may september in sun and wang 2015 respectively which are longer than that used in this study june august and include longer period before the arrival and after the withdraw of the summer monsoon in which land areas may be more important fig 7 iii different methods are used wei et al 2012 used the qibt method and sun and wang 2015 used the flexpart model with tracking time of 15 and 10 days respectively and the tracking time in their studies was shorter which would lead to lower total contributions along the derived trajectories e g the total contribution in sun and wang 2015 was 80 5 than those in the present study in addition the calculation of contributions from land and sea areas in this study is more rigorous and iv different data are used as mentioned in wei et al 2012 the evapotranspiration in their study is higher over land jiménez et al 2011 and lower over ocean bosilovich et al 2011 compared with other reanalysis we also found that si contributes more moisture than the well known ars or bb does however as a moisture source for yrb si has been overlooked in previous studies probably because si is so far away from yrb that the tracking time generally used in the quantitative studies e g wei et al 2012 sun and wang 2015 is relatively short for the region it should be noted that this result is consistent with previous studies which investigated the relationship between the yrb summer precipitation and the somali jet e g wang and xue 2003 wang and yang 2014 dai and xiao 2015 and indicated the crucial role of the somali jet in transporting moisture from si to the north hemisphere in boreal summer wang and xue 2003 zhu 2012 jiang et al 2016 we suggest that the important contribution from si is reasonable due to the reasons as follows i si has relatively low precipitation but high evaporation not shown in boreal summer which implies that most of the evaporated moisture would be transported to the north indian ocean by the prevailing wind i e the cross equatorial flows and then to yrb together with moisture evaporated from ars and bb and ii though the grid cell contributions over si are generally lower than those over ars or bb fig 4 the summation of grid cell contributions of si could be larger than that of ars or bb fig 5 due to the much larger area of si fig 1 5 2 the moisture transport paths 5 2 1 the trajectory frequency method the tfm is proposed to quantitatively and objectively diagnose the moisture transport paths to yrb by dealing with the trajectories obtained from the modified drm dominguez et al 2006 martinez and dominguez 2014 which is used to quantify moisture sources for yrb summer precipitation in this study the results derived from the tfm eq 5 figs 10a and 12 and the drm figs 4 and 9 show consistent tendencies in variation and quite similar spatial patterns with some differences especially in the regions far away from yrb e g the eastern pacific oceans the drm derived percentage contribution is determined by the local collection of moisture from each grid cell and how much it would lose during the transport process along the trajectory martinez and dominguez 2014 which is a combination of trajectory information and local moisture conditions i e evaporation and precipitable water over each grid cell along the trajectory from the grid cell to the sink region the tfm derived result is fully determined by the trajectories eq 5 which means that all of the grid cells passed through by a trajectory have the same weight no matter how far away the grid cells are from the sink region and that each trajectory has the same weight no matter how much moisture a trajectory could carry in this context the tfm only presents the information of moisture transport paths that are derived from the drm results which helps to reveal the dominant circulation pattern therefore the trajectory information in both the drm and tfm derived results is responsible for their similarities i e between the drm derived percentage contribution and the eq 5 ratio of tfm while the local moisture conditions along the trajectories lead to the spatial differences between drm and tfm in particular most of the moisture evaporated from the regions far away from the sink region would lose gradually during the transport process to approach the sink region which greatly influences the percentage contributions in moisture amount from the source regions however the tfm derived results are not influenced by the local moisture conditions along the trajectories consequently in the regions farther away from yrb i e the sink region the spatial differences between drm and tfm are more obvious it is suggested that by dealing with the trajectories the tfm can serve as a diagnosis method for the tracked trajectories by corresponding methods or models e g drm different from the other methods used to deal with the trajectories such as the commonly used cluster analysis e g moody and galloway 1988 dorling et al 1992 tfm is a method intended to describe the paths with the frequency nature over various areas and can be regarded as a more objective method for natural clustering although there are a number of methods for cluster analysis they have been little if any use for a single region of moisture source eq 7 in particular tfm is capable of quantitatively estimating the relative importance of a given region e g scs in this study in the transport of moisture evaporating from upstream source regions eqs 6 8 in this context the relative importance of particular pathways can be assessed by the tfm e g the pathways through scs in the present study thus the method offers a new perspective on the analysis of moisture paths as the trajectories are the foundation of the tfm the tfm must be used together with the drm or the other lagrangian methods such as qibt dirmeyer and brubaker 1999 flexpart stohl and james 2004 2005 and 3d t tuinenburg et al 2012 although care must be taken when calculating trajectories in 3 d space 5 2 2 association with the asian summer monsoon as introduced in section 1 the moisture supply for yrb summer precipitation is closely related to the asian summer monsoon which includes the ism and easm ding and chan 2005 to reveal the association between the moisture transport process to yrb and the asian summer monsoon fig 13 presents the moisuture weighted vertically integrated wind fields in a relatively small region which shows more detailed information compared with fig 12 and the 500 hpa geopotential height at different pentads throughout the summer season in early summer fig 13a wpsh is over scs and yrb is dominated by westerly flow which corresponds to the intense moisture transport branch south to the tibetan plateau fig 12a the intense moisture transport from oceans can only reach the northwestern margin of wpsh i e south china which corresponds to the last phase of the so called pre summer rainy season in south china with the ending time in the first 10 day period of june ding and chan 2005 by the end of june fig 13b wpsh has northward shifted and exists over the southeast side of yrb which leads to stronger moisture transport from wp fig 12b compared to early summer fig 12a the ism has begun wang and lin 2002 prasad and hayashi 2005 and yrb is dominated by southernly flow from oceanic areas which corresponds to the intense moisture transport from the indian ocean fig 12b with the period generally known as the meiyu rainy season in yrb ding 2004 ge et al 2008 in late july fig 13c the wpsh is more westward and northward compared to late june fig 13b which would enhance the moisture transport from wp fig 12c though the wind field seems to be almost the same as in fig 13b the difference field not shown shows that ism has weakened which coincides with the weakened moisture transport from the indian ocean fig 12c compared to late june fig 12b by the end of summer fig 13d wpsh is slightly more northward compared to late july fig 13c and has retreated to the east side of yrb with almost at the same latitudes as yrb and the southeastly flow along the south margin of wpsh carries a large amount of moisture from wp that enters yrb from the east side which agrees with the variation of the moisture sources fig 9d and paths fig 12d the southwestly flow over yrb and south china seems to have disappeared and ism has withdrawn from china ding 2007 as a result the moisture transport branch over the indian ocean weakens fig 12d and the contribution from the indian ocean decreases figs 7b 9d 6 conclusion we utilized high temporal and spatial resolution cfsr reanalysis data and station precipitation observations in the mid lower reaches of the yangtze river basin over an extended period 1979 2010 to quantitatively analyze the sources of moisture for summer june 1 august 31 precipitation over yrb using the modified drm dominguez et al 2006 martinez and dominguez 2014 we have also quantitatively diagnosed the pathways for moisture transport from source regions to yrb using a newly developed trajectory frequency method tfm by dealing with the moisture transport paths for yrb the tfm serves as a diagnosis method in terms of pathway frequency for the tracked trajectories provided by drm or other corresponding models the main conclusions are as follows i in the summer land areas in china and southeast asia the indian ocean the south china sea and the western pacific ocean are found to be the main moisture source regions for precipitation over yrb the total land areas the indian ocean and the pacific ocean contribute 40 2 29 9 and 27 6 of the moisture for summer precipitation over yrb respectively which indicates that the contribution of terrestrial evapotranspiration is important but less important than the contribution of oceanic evaporation the contribution from si 12 9 which has been overlooked in previous studies is larger than that from either ars 7 4 or bb 9 6 ii averaged over the whole summer period with tfm the branch of water vapor transport stretching from the arabian sea through the bay of bengal the indochina peninsula south china sea and over south china is the most intense vapor transport pathway other main paths include the westerly flow south to the tibetan plateau the branch in the northern west pacific ocean the easterly flow in the equatorial pacific ocean and the australia cross equatorial flow iii the percentage contribution from land areas is over 50 in the early summer and then decreases to less than 40 after late june the indian ocean is the most important oceanic source before mid july with its largest contribution during the period of heavy precipitation while the pacific ocean becomes the more important oceanic source after mid july all of these are closely associated with the similar intraseasonal variabilities in moisture sources and moisture transport paths which is caused by the changes in the asian monsoon dynamics including wpsh activities as qualitatively summarized in fig 14 iv except for early summer the south china sea is very important for water vapor transport to yrb because most of the moisture evaporated from other oceanic sources is transported into yrb passing through the south china sea as quantitatively indicated by the tfm results acknowledgments this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant nos 41675007 and 41475063

7384,this study uses daily rainfall records of a dense network of 240 gauges in central arizona to gain insights on i the variability of the seasonal distributions of rainfall extremes ii how the seasonal distributions affect the shape of the annual distribution and iii the presence of spatial patterns and orographic control for these distributions for this aim recent methodological advancements in peak over threshold analysis and application of the generalized pareto distribution gpd were used to assess the suitability of the gpd hypothesis and improve the estimation of its parameters while limiting the effect of short sample sizes the distribution of daily rainfall extremes was found to be heavy tailed i e gpd shape parameter ξ 0 during the summer season dominated by convective monsoonal thunderstorms the exponential distribution a special case of gpd with ξ 0 was instead showed to be appropriate for modeling wintertime daily rainfall extremes mainly caused by cold fronts transported by westerly flow the annual distribution exhibited a mixed behavior with lighter upper tails than those found in summer a hybrid model mixing the two seasonal distributions was demonstrated capable of reproducing the annual distribution organized spatial patterns mainly controlled by elevation were observed for the gpd scale parameter while ξ did not show any clear control of location or orography the quantiles returned by the gpd were found to be very similar to those provided by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa atlas 14 which used the generalized extreme value gev distribution results of this work are useful to improve statistical modeling of daily rainfall extremes at high spatial resolution and provide diagnostic tools for assessing the ability of climate models to simulate extreme events keywords rainfall extremes peak over threshold analysis generalized pareto distribution seasonal extremes annual extremes spatial variability 1 introduction the statistical characterization and modeling of rainfall extremes are crucial to support hydrologic engineering and climate studies with high societal economic and environmental impacts they are needed to inform hydrologic modeling of floods norbiato et al 2009 golian et al 2010 hapuarachchi et al 2011 alfieri et al 2016 which are one of the most severe natural hazards causing significant losses in terms of both property and fatalities ashley and ashley 2008 di baldassarre et al 2010 gochis et al 2015 peden et al 2017 statistical models of extreme rainfall are critical to design and manage infrastructures e g madsen et al 2002 bonnin et al 2006 langousis and veneziano 2007 haddad et al 2011 which are becoming increasingly interdependent and then more vulnerable to extreme events rinaldi et al 2001 hasan and foliente 2015 in addition several climate projections wilby and wigley 2002 frei et al 2006 wuebbles et al 2014 prein et al 2017 and theoretical arguments frei et al 1998 trenberth 1999 emori and brown 2005 suggest that intensity and occurrence of hydrologic extremes can be significantly affected by global warming as a result the analysis of historical rainfall records is essential to evaluate the ability of climate models to capture heavy rainfall in future scenarios the statistical investigation of rainfall extreme intensities over a given duration has been mainly carried out by analyzing the frequency of two types of data the block maxima bm and the peak over threshold pot series the bm series are built by extracting the maximum rainfall rate over a specified time window usually one year while the pot data are obtained by retaining all records above a given threshold u for an infinite sample size the theoretical distribution of the bm is the generalized extreme value gev fisher and tippett 1928 gnedenko 1943 coles 2001 while the limit distribution for pot data over a high enough threshold belongs to the domain of the generalized pareto distribution gpd balkema and de haan 1974 pickands 1975 the extreme value theory evt davison 1990 coles 2001 salvadori and de michele 2001 and papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2013 provides theoretical evidence that links parameters of the gev distribution and the gpd specifically both distributions have a shape parameter that controls the upper tail and under suitable conditions the evt shows that the shape parameter of the gev distribution and the corresponding gpd are the same since the annual bm only retains one value per year their frequency analysis requires long term datasets usually 30 years to robustly estimate the distribution parameters several studies have adopted the gev model to characterize and simulate annual rainfall maxima at daily scale in many areas of the world e g nadarajah 2005 aryal et al 2009 papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2013 villarini et al 2011a villarini 2012 on the other hand the pot series is able to preserve a larger portion of the hydrologic information available in the dataset so that relatively shorter records may be sufficient to analyze this type of data previous work has shown that the gpd is able to successfully reproduce daily rainfall extremes by analyzing pot series observed in different climatic settings madsen et al 1997a b 2002 deidda and puliga 2006 beguería and vicente serrano 2006 beguería et al 2009 serinaldi and kilsby 2014 moreover the efficiency and lower data requirement of the gpd have stimulated studies devoted to test improve existing or develop new methods for analyzing pot data and fitting the gpd specifically work has been focused on i the comparison of graphical and numerical methods to identify a proper threshold u deidda and puliga 2006 langousis et al 2016 solari et al 2017 ii the evaluation of different parameter estimators de michele and salvadori 2005 deidda and puliga 2009 iii the development of a threshold invariant method for estimating parameters of the gpd deidda 2010 and iv the analysis of the bias on the estimation of the gpd shape parameter due to the sample size serinaldi and kilsby 2014 this study uses some these methodological advancements on pot analysis and application of the gpd to address three research questions that so far have received limited attention including i how does the distribution of rainfall extremes vary with the seasons when these are characterized by markedly different weather systems ii how do the seasonal distributions affect the shape of the annual distribution and iii how do annual and seasonal distributions vary in space and are affected by orography to answer these questions statistical analyses of daily rainfall extremes are conducted at annual and seasonal scales using a dense network of rain gauges in central arizona fig 1 this region of the desert southwest united states has experienced rapid urbanization and population growth over the last few decades mostly concentrated in the phoenix metropolitan area chow et al 2012 as a result of this land cover and land use change the vulnerability to flooding has increased under both summer monsoonal thunderstorms adams and comrie 1997 and wintertime rain episodes associated with cold fronts sheppard et al 2002 rivera et al 2014 despite this the statistical characterization of rainfall extremes in this region has received little attention with the notable exception of the updated version of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration atlas 14 noaa14 bonnin et al 2006 that provides the intensity durationfrequency idf curves adopted for infrastructure design and management the research questions are here investigated using records of a dense network of gauges installed by the flood control district of the maricopa county fcdmc over the last 30 years fig 1b this dataset is complemented by long term observations of gauges of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa national center for environmental information ncei after demonstrating that the gpd is a suitable distribution to model the pot daily rainfall extremes at annual and seasonal scales its parameters are bias corrected to account for short sample sizes following the recent findings of papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2013 and serinaldi and kilsby 2014 next it is shown how the gpd distribution of daily rainfall extremes varies in the summer and winter seasons which are dominated by markedly different synoptic patterns leading to heavy rainfall a hybrid model that mixes the two seasonal distributions is then proposed and tested to reproduce the annual distribution subsequently the spatial variability of the gpd parameters is investigated along with the effect of orography which has been shown to exert an important control on rainfall properties and regimes in central arizona e g adams and comrie 1997 mascaro 2017 as well as on the shape of the rainfall extreme distributions in specific regions of united states padoan et al 2012 reich and shaby 2012 and at global scale cavanaugh and gershunov 2015 finally the implications of the study for engineering applications and climate change analyses are discussed while this work is focused on central arizona the methodologies proposed are broadly applicable to other regions to gain insights on the seasonal and spatial variability of rainfall extremes improve the ability to model them and assess the skill of climate models 2 study area and dataset the study area is located in the state of arizona fig 1a in southwestern united states as shown in the digital elevation model of fig 1b the area includes two distinct physiographic regions with a sharp elevation range the first and largest is part of the basin and range province which is a region at lower elevation from 200 to 600 m a s l that includes the phoenix metropolitan area surrounded by the sonoran desert and crop fields the second region is instead part of the transition zone to the colorado plateau here elevation is much higher with peaks reaching up to 2000 m a s l in the mogollon rim located in the northeastern corner in central arizona the constant presence of a subtropical high pressure ridge guarantees dry and warm conditions all year around sheppard et al 2002 for example in phoenix the annual mean temperature and precipitation are 24 c and 204 mm respectively as obtained from the ncei records from 1970 to 2000 climate is also characterized by a strong seasonality due to different synoptic conditions dominating weather in summer and winter which lead to a bimodal rainfall regime the months from july to september are more humid due to the occurrence of the north american monsoon when water vapor is transported from the eastern tropical pacific ocean and gulf of california and to a lower extent from the gulf of mexico adams and comrie 1997 during the monsoon convective thunderstorms with high rainfall intensities very short duration 1 h and small spatial extent occur relatively frequently according to a diurnally modulated cycle balling and brazel 1987 these storms accounts on average for 33 of the annual total rainfall but this percentage varies considerably from year to year the months from late fall to early summer are instead much drier during this period dominated by westerly flow occasional cold fronts generate storm systems that occupy large areas and may last for multiple days while these systems are in general characterized by low to moderate rain intensities in some cases they may include convective cells with higher rates sheppard et al 2002 a recent study by mascaro 2017 analyzed a number of statistical properties of rainfall in central arizona using records from the gauges of the fcdmc network analyses were conducted separately for the summer from june to september and winter from november to march seasons the main results that are useful for the goals of this paper include the following i due to its widespread nature wintertime rainfall exhibits higher inter gauge correlation as compared to the more intermittent summer storms for example the characteristic spatial scales of daily rainfall are 50 km in summer and 500 km in winter as measured through the correlation distances of the rainfall signals ii in both seasons elevation controls the rainfall seasonal accumulation that for summer varies linearly from 50 mm at 200 m a s l to 200 mm at 2300 m a s l iii a simple investigation of the seasonal climatology of maximum rainfall intensities revealed that at daily scale their magnitude does not differ substantially in summer and winter and is affected by orography this study uses the same rainfall records collected by the fcdmc network analyzed by mascaro 2017 the fcdmc network has been installed since the beginning of the 1980s to monitor in real time the movement of regional storm systems in the phoenix metropolitan region and surrounding areas as shown in fig 1b most of the gauges are located within the maricopa county an additional set of gauges has been also deployed in neighboring counties mostly the yavapai county to capture larger systems and areas at higher elevation where storms can cause floods and flash floods in the urban areas downstream fig 1c shows how the number of gauges has constantly increased in time reaching a total of 310 the network covers an area of 29600 km2 with a density of 1 gauge every 100 km2 which increases up to 4 3 gauges in urban areas depending on date of installation and periods of missing data the record lengths vary from 5 to 34 years over the period from 1980 to 2013 fig 1b the gauges span a wide range of elevation from 220 to 2325 m a s l fig 1d shows the number of gauges falling in 10 elevation bins covering the interval from 200 to 2000 m a s l the relation has been plotted with a continuous back line using all 310 gauges currently a total of 263 47 gauges are located at elevation lower higher than 800 m since the sample length affects the statistical analyses on rainfall extremes these were performed on a subset of the 220 gauges with 15 years of observations the choice of 15 years has been considered a good compromise between the needs to i support the statistical significance of the analyses and ii capture a large range of elevations and locations in the region the dashed black line in fig 1d shows how the elevation distribution for the subsample of 220 gauges resembles well the distribution of the entire network given the limited record length of the fcdmc gauges longer rainfall time series from the ncei database were also acquired focusing on the 20 gauges of this region with 30 years of observations of which at least 15 are included in the period 1980 2013 the location of these stations is also reported in fig 1b along with the corresponding record length which reaches up to 98 years the gray line in fig 1d shows instead that the ncei gauges are all located at relatively low elevation 800 m mostly within the urban areas the rain gauges of the fcdmc are of the tipping bucket type with an accumulated rain depth of 1 mm which causes problems of quantization of the rainfall signal deidda and puliga 2006 2009 langousis et al 2016 that need to be properly taken into account in the analyses as described in the next section the raw rainfall data containing the tipping instants in seconds were acquired from the fcdmc database processed according to the technique described in mascaro et al 2013 appendix a and then aggregated at daily resolution the records of the ncei stations were instead directly downloaded at daily resolution differently from the fcdmc records the ncei data have a precision of 0 1 mm 3 methods analyses of daily rainfall extremes were conducted on the records of 240 gauges of the fcdmc and ncei networks at annual and seasonal scale the latter includes the summer monsoon period which occurs from july to september and the winter season defined from november to march as in mascaro 2017 the methodologies applied to evaluate the suitability of the gpd hypothesis to model the annual and seasonal daily rainfall extremes and estimate its parameters are described in the following subsections for clarity of exposition the technique adopted to correct the bias in the estimation of the gpd shape parameter due to the sample size and the hybrid model used to mix the seasonal distributions are instead directly illustrated in the results section 3 1 autocorrelation and trend analysis accounting for field significance a set of preliminary analyses was conducted on the pot times series to assess the statistical independence of the samples prior to fitting the gpd distribution first the presence of temporal correlation was investigated testing the significance of the lag 1 autocorrelation computing the kendall correlation coefficient next the existence of monotonically increasing or decreasing trends was analyzed using the mann kendall test mann 1945 both tests have been utilized in similar studies e g villarini et al 2011a b villarini 2012 guerreiro et al 2014 serinaldi and kilsby 2014 here they have been applied with a significance level α 5 since the gauges are geographically closed and the spatial correlation among the rainfall observations can be significant especially in winter mascaro 2017 results of multiple statistical tests may be affected by the problem known as test multiplicity wilks 2011 this relates to the fact that when a test is applied collectively and independently to n gauges with a significance level α the null hypothesis may be rejected on average for α z n gauges while holding true for the entire set of stations the local significance level α cannot then be used to evaluate the test applied to all stations because the chance of detecting a false change is actually larger than α the global or field significance should be instead calculated wilks 2011 summarizes the main approaches that have been proposed to estimate the field significance for independent and spatially correlated fields or stations with focus on applications in atmospheric sciences previous studies where the field significance has been estimated on hydrologic records include the work of douglas et al 2000 and guerreiro et al 2014 and references therein here to account for the spatial correlation among the gauges a method based on bootstrap resampling was used to determine the field significance for the autocorrelation and mann kendall tests as in guerreiro et al 2014 the method is described in appendix a 3 2 the generalized pareto distribution the generalized pareto distribution gpd was used to model statistically the daily rainfall extremes the cumulative distribution function fu x of the gpd derived from the exceedances of x above the threshold u both in mm is defined as 1 f u x f u x α u ξ 1 1 ξ x u α u 1 ξ ξ 0 1 exp x u α u ξ 0 where ξ is the shape parameter and α u 0 in mm is the scale parameter the shape parameter ξ controls the upper tail of the distribution and then the tendency to generate heavy extremes for ξ 0 the gpd reduces to the exponential distribution for ξ 0 the gpd is heavy tailed or subexponential and for ξ 0 the gpd is short tailed with an upper bound value equal to u α u ξ here parameters of the gpd were estimated using the multiple threshold method mtm proposed by deidda 2010 in this approach the following relation is used for the cdf of nonnegative rainfall data f x 2 f x 1 ζ 0 ζ 0 f 0 x x 0 where ζ 0 pr x 0 and f0 x is the cdf of x 0 if f0 x is modeled with the gpd i e u 0 mm eq 2 becomes 3 f x f x α 0 ξ ζ 0 1 ζ 0 1 ξ x α 0 1 ξ ξ 0 1 ζ 0 exp x α 0 ξ 0 for x 0 where the shape parameter α 0 is linked to α u through the relation α 0 α u ξ u the mtm is based on a hierarchal approach for estimating parameters of 3 which is briefly summarized in appendix b as shown by deidda 2010 serinaldi and kilsby 2014 langousis et al 2016 and mamalakis et al 2017 the mtm is able to minimize uncertainty and bias associated with the threshold selection and to reduce the distortions due to quantization of the rainfall signal the mtm was applied with the probability weighted moments pwm estimator hosking and wallis 1997 which resulted to be less biased and more efficient than the maximum likelihood method according to monte carlo simulations where gpd samples were generated adopting similar ranges of parameters and size of the analyzed rainfall records 3 3 goodness of fit tests accounting for field significance the anderson darling cramér von mises and kolmogorov smirnov goodness of fit tests were applied to assess the suitability of the gpd to model the data since the rainfall records of the fcdmc network are discretized with a resolution of 1 mm the procedure based on monte carlo simulations proposed by deidda and puliga 2006 was followed to calculate the acceptance region of each test this procedure is described in appendix c as for the mann kendall and autocorrelation tests the problem of field significance also arises when multiple goodness of fit tests are applied if the hypothesis of spatial independence among the gauges is assumed the method proposed by livezey and chen 1983 can be adopted to compute the field significance this technique assumes that the number of failures is distributed according to a binomial distribution with a number of trials equal to the number of gauges and probability of event occurrence i e the rejection of the null hypothesis equal to the significance level of each test to account for the presence of spatial dependence this method can be adapted by using the beta binomial distribution as in serinaldi et al 2018 this is a compound distribution based on the binomial distribution with a probability of event occurrence that is not fixed but that varies based on a beta distribution as explained by serinaldi et al 2018 appendix b parameters of the beta binomial distribution are estimated as a function of the constant probability of event occurrence assumed in the standard binomial distribution and the mean cross correlation between the rainfall time series of all gauges 4 results 4 1 evaluation of the gpd hypothesis before testing the suitability of the gpd the hypothesis that the samples of rainfall records are independent and identically distributed was evaluated for this aim the lag 1 autocorrelation and mann kendall tests were applied to the annual and seasonal time series for the threshold u 4 mm corresponding to 95th percentiles of the empirical rainfall distribution of most gauges table 1 shows the percent of gauges including both fcdmc and ncei where the lag 1 autocorrelation and the presence of trends were found to be statistically significant at 95 confidence level if the test multiplicity is not taken into account the null hypothesis should be rejected if these percentages are 5 which happens in most cases however when the field significance and spatial correlation are taken into account the critical values calculated through the bootstrap resampling experiments of appendix a are larger than or in some cases very close to the observed percentages of rejections table 1 based on these results there is no evidence of the presence of autocorrelation and trend in the analyzed records moreover it is worth noticing that a recent study of serinaldi et al 2018 poses serious concerns on the utility of tests for trend detection in exploratory phase these authors recommend instead their adoption to verify hypotheses on data behavior that are guided by the underlying physics and validated through independent observations the suitability of the gpd was then preliminarily explored using the l moments ratio diagrams hosking 1990 fig 2 shows the relation between l skewness and l kurtosis for a range of distributions see caption for details along with the sampling values calculated from the annual summer and winter records of ncei and fcdmc networks with the threshold u 4 mm the corresponding means of the sample l moments are also reported it is apparent that for both networks the gpd appears to be the best candidate to model the pot samples above a high threshold the mean values of the sample l moments reveal additional insights first the behavior of summer and winter records is different especially for ncei second the annual mean lies between the summer and winter averages third the average of the sample l moments for the winter records is located very close to the l moments of the exponential distribution a special case of the gpd these preliminary findings will be further explored and discussed in the next sections 4 2 estimation and bias correction of gpd parameters since the l moments ratio diagrams supported the suitability of the gpd this distribution was fitted to the full records of the gauges using the mtm approach to estimate its parameters table 2 reports mean standard deviation of the estimates of the shape parameter ξ across the gauges of ncei and fcdmc networks for the annual and seasonal periods original the values of ξ are in most cases 0 confirming the evidence found in previous studies that the distribution of extreme daily rainfall tends to be characterized by heavy tails e g deidda and puliga 2006 villarini et al 2011a b papalexiou et al 2013 serinaldi and kilsby 2014 cavanaugh et al 2015 langousis et al 2016 as shown in fig 1b the record length of each gauge is different implying that the ξ estimates have been obtained for different sample sizes recently papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2013 and serinaldi and kilsby 2014 hereafter pk13 and sk14 respectively have studied the effect of the sample size on the shape parameter ξ of the gev distribution and gpd respectively proposing empirical equations to correct the bias due to the sample length a similar approach was adopted here using some of the numerical findings of these two studies that analyzed a larger number of gauges with longer records fig 3 shows the relation between the ξ estimates and the sample size n since the application of mtm involves the computation of pot data over a range of thresholds each associated with a different sample size see appendix b the value of n was obtained as the mean of all sample lengths from fig 3 one can note i the much larger size of the ncei records and ii the reduced spread of the ξ estimates as n increases regarding the latter point it is important to highlight that the number of stations with larger n n 500 and 200 at annual and seasonal scales respectively is significantly lower than that of the gauges with shorter records this implies that the uncertainty of the ξ values for large n is higher despite this the assumption of reduced spread of ξ could be considered reasonable based on similar findings on larger datasets reported by pk13 and sk14 assuming that the true distribution of ξ for n is normal with mean μξ and standard deviation σξ then the distribution for a finite n can also be assumed normal with mean μξ n and standard deviation σξ n as in sk14 the following equations were used to estimate μξ n and σξ n 4a μ ξ n μ ξ b μ n c μ 4b σ ξ n σ ξ b σ n c σ in pk13 and sk14 the asymptotic values μξ and σξ were estimated along with bμ cμ bσ and cσ by fitting eqs 4a and 4b to all points which were uniformly distributed across the range of analyzed n values here since most of the points were available for low n μξ and σξ were estimated prior to the fitting specifically the values of μξ in each time period were estimated as the mean of the ξ estimates at the ncei gauges see mean values of original in table 2 as these exhibit an asymptotic behavior across a large range of high n values as shown in table 2 the value of μξ estimated from the ncei dataset is larger in summer as compared to winter consistent with sk14 who fitted the gpd in the same seasons to the pot data exceeding the 98th percentile of gauges in europe north america and australia for the annual time period the estimated μξ 0 091 see table 2 is instead very close to the asymptotic values of 0 15 and 0 114 obtained by koutsoyiannis 2004b and pk13 respectively applying the gev distribution at annual scale for σξ given the limited number of gauges analyzed here the value of 0 045 reported by pk13 was adopted in all cases as it is based on the analyses of 15 137 gauges parameters bμ cμ bσ and cσ were then estimated for each time period by i dividing the points of fig 3 into 15 classes with equal number of points ii calculating the mean and standard deviation of ξ for each class and the corresponding average of n and iii fitting eqs 4a and 4b to the 15 points of the classes the estimated values of bμ cμ bσ and cσ are displayed in table 3 while the μξ n and σξ n relations are plotted in fig 3 with solid and dashed lines respectively as a next step the μξ n and σξ n relations were used to correct the bias of the ξ estimates by applying the unbiased estimator proposed by papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2013 5 ξ n σ ξ σ ξ l ξ μ ξ l μ ξ where ξ is the mtm estimate of the shape parameter and ξ n is the bias corrected value the mean and standard deviation across the gauges of the bias corrected ξ are also reported in table 2 consistent with sk14 the application of eq 5 led to an increase of the mean and reduction of the variance the mtm method constrained with the bias corrected values of ξ was then applied to re estimate the other parameters of the gpd the goodness of fit tests were applied to assess the suitability of the gpd with bias corrected parameters results are presented in table 4 columns labeled gpd which shows the percent of stations where each test was rejected at the local 5 significance level if the hypothesis of spatial independence is assumed the method based on the binomial distribution with a number of trials equal to 240 the number of gauges of both networks and probability of event occurrence of 0 05 leads to a total of 18 rejections or 7 5 at the global 5 significance level if the spatial dependence is taken into account via the beta binomial distribution see section 3 3 the number of rejections rises to 84 50 and 94 or 35 0 20 8 and 39 2 for the annual summer and winter periods respectively as shown in table 4 these percent thresholds are never exceeded overall the probability charts of fig 2 and the goodness of fit tests indicate that the gpd with bias corrected parameters is a good candidate to represent the distribution of daily rainfall extremes this is further confirmed by fig 4 which shows examples of the comparison between the empirical survival function and the gpd fitted to the annual summer and winter records of one and two gauges of ncei and fcdmc networks respectively spanning different elevations see figure caption one can note i the excellent ability of the gpd to represent the empirical distributions ii the heavier tails larger ξ of the distributions in summer iii the tendency of the gpd to approach the exponential distribution in winter ξ close to 0 and iv the intermediate behavior at annual scale the differences between the distributions of the daily rainfall extremes in the two seasons are further investigated in the next section 4 3 seasonal variability of the probability distribution of daily rainfall extremes the seasonal behavior of the distributions of the daily rainfall extremes was analyzed first by plotting in fig 5 the frequency distributions of the annual and seasonal bias corrected shape parameter ξ of all gauges the distribution of ξ in each time period appears to be bell shaped thus confirming the findings obtained by papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2013 with the gev distribution on a larger dataset in summer the daily extremes are characterized by heavier tails as compared to winter with mean ξ of 0 145 and 0 005 respectively when considering the annual records the behavior is intermediate with an average ξ of 0 093 the standard deviation of the ξ estimates at all gauges is instead rather constant across all time periods with a value of 0 050 as expected after the bias correction since the ξ estimates for the winter records are distributed around a mean value close to 0 the hypothesis that the winter pot rainfall data are drawn from the exponential distribution was evaluated by fitting the gpd with ξ 0 and then applying the goodness of fit tests for comparison this was also done for the summer records results are shown in table 4 columns labeled exp the percent rejections in winter are below the critical threshold of 39 2 at the global significance level of 5 while those in summer are larger than the corresponding threshold of 20 8 as a consequence the exponential distribution can be considered an alternative good candidate to model daily rainfall extremes in winter while it does not capture properly the summer distributions that tend to be heavy tailed to further support this fig 6 presents the q q plots of the gpd with bias corrected ξ and the exponential distribution ξ 0 fitted to the winter records of the three gauges displayed in fig 4 it is apparent that the differences are minimal 4 4 hybrid probability distribution for annual daily rainfall extremes prior studies e g kozubowski et al 2009 villarini 2012 cavanaugh et al 2015 have suggested that the annual distribution of the daily rainfall extremes could be obtained by mixing the distributions of different rainfall generation mechanisms which can be distinct in each season this hypothesis was tested here by evaluating whether in central arizona the shape of the annual distribution could be reproduced by mixing the exponential distribution and the heavy tailed gpd that were found to be suitable to model the winter and summer extreme intensities respectively however the summer and winter seasons defined here do not include the months from april to june and of october which are usually very dry mascaro 2017 but where weather events leading to extreme rainfall could still occur pool 2005 two sets of analyses were then carried out to assess the importance of each season summer winter and other months on the distribution of the annual rainfall extremes both analyses were conducted using the records from 1980 to 2013 to have a common climatic reference the first test aims at identifying the seasons when the largest daily rainfall intensities were observed more frequently on an annual basis for each gauge the daily rainfall data of a given year were sorted and the seasons when the largest m values occurred were identified using data of all years the number of times when each season was found in the m ranks was counted and converted in percentage fig 7 a shows results for m 15 obtained by averaging the percentages across all gauges within each year the highest daily rainfall rates were observed more frequently in winter 52 of the times followed by the summer season 35 these events occurred instead in a limited fraction of times 13 in the other months the second analysis was instead performed using the entire record of daily rainfall data with the goal of evaluating which season has the largest effect on the upper tail of the annual distribution of the daily extremes for each gauge the seasons when the largest 100 daily rainfall values occurred were identified next the percent of times when each season was found in the first 100 ranks was computed using data of all gauges results of this analysis are presented in fig 7b which shows that winter and summer time weather events led to the largest daily rainfall values in about 90 of the cases with a prevalence of events occurring in winter on average 52 as compared to summer 38 for all cases the fraction of events observed in the other months was instead quite low 10 the findings of fig 7 suggest that the contribution of the other months is negligible as a result a hybrid model mixing the summer and winter distributions was applied to simulate the annual distribution of the daily rainfall extremes the cdf of the hybrid model fhyb x is defined as 6 f hyb x α 0 w ζ 0 w α 0 s ξ s ζ 0 s p w p s p w f exp x α 0 w ζ 0 w p s f gpd x α 0 s ξ s ζ 0 s for x 0 where fexp x is the cdf of the exponential distribution 3 with parameters α0 w and ζ0 w estimated on winter records fgpd x is the cdf of the gpd 3 with parameters α0 s ξ s and ζ0 s estimated on summer records applying the bias correction for ξ s as explained in section 4 2 and pw and ps are the weights of the seasonal distributions estimated as 7a p w n w n w n s 7b p s n s n w n s 1 p w where nw 151 and ns 92 are the number of days of the winter and summer seasons respectively similar hybrid probability distributions were successfully applied to daily rainfall data by woolhiser and pegram 1979 woolhiser and roldán 1982 and foufoula georgiou and lettenmaier 1987 to model jointly low and high rain rates or rainfall occurrence the suitability of the hybrid distribution was assessed again through the application of the goodness of fit tests as illustrated in section 3 3 and appendix c a monte carlo approach was adopted to generate the critical level of each test in order to account for data quantization this required the generation of random samples extracted from the hybrid model for this aim a set of numbers ui i 1 n included between 0 and 1 was randomly generated from a uniform distribution then if ui pw ui pw the corresponding quantile was computed from the exponential distribution gpd results are presented in table 4 column labeled hybrid which shows that the percent rejection is always lower than the corresponding critical values at the 5 global significance level in addition performances of the hybrid distribution were compared with those of the gpd applied at annual scale by reporting in fig 8 the q q plots for the same three gauges displayed in previous figures the differences between the two distributions are small apart from slight discrepancies for the higher quantiles these are due to the fact that compound distributions tend to exhibit heavier tails than single distributions fitted to the same dataset see e g koutsoyiannis 2004a 4 5 spatial variability of the distribution of daily rainfall extremes and effect of elevation as a next step the spatial variability of the gpd parameters and their relation with gauge elevation were evaluated at seasonal and annual scale fig 9 shows results for parameters α0 and ζ0 of the exponential distribution fitted to the winter rainfall data fig 9a reveals that the scale parameter α0 which controls the mean of the distribution tends to increase from south to north this pattern is partially explained by elevation z as shown in fig 9b where α0 increases with z up to 1000 m a s l and then assumes a relatively constant mean value to interpret this relation the following equation was fitted to the data 8 α 0 z a a α 0 e bz where α 0 is the value of α0 for z 0 that was assumed equal to 4 mm based on values previously published e g beguería and vicente serrano 2006 deidda 2010 and a and b are parameters estimated via non linear fitting whose values are reported in table 5 the fraction of rainy days ζ0 grows from southwest to northeast fig 9c and is linearly related to z fig 9d consistent with the pattern found by mascaro 2017 for the annual totals table 5 reports parameters of the linear regression between ζ0 and z to explore the validity of the equations adopted to interpret the relations between z and parameters α0 and ζ0 the 90 confidence intervals of these curves were built through monte carlo experiments as described in appendix d as shown in fig 9b and d the confidence intervals of both curves are very narrow across all values of z thus confirming the robustness of the adopted analytical equations overall these results indicate that the intensity of wintertime daily rainfall extremes increases from the valley areas in the south to the mountainous regions in the northern portion of the domain results of the same analysis for parameters ξ α0 and ζ0 of the gpd fitted to the pot rainfall data in summer are displayed in fig 10 as previously discussed the distribution of extreme daily rainfall during the monsoon season is heavy tailed i e ξ 0 fig 10a and b show that the shape parameter ξ does not exhibit an organized spatial pattern and is not significantly controlled by orography as indicated by the very low coefficient of determination r2 and the relatively wide confidence intervals of the linear regression see appendix d which partially do not include the line fitted on the original data the values of the scale parameter α0 are rather scattered throughout the urbanized area and tend to slightly rise at higher elevation fig 10c and d this pattern is well captured by eq 8 as shown by the relatively narrow confidence intervals finally the portion of rainy days ζ0 displays a clear orographic control fig 10e and f that is stronger than the one found in winter as revealed by the higher r2 and slope of the regression line reported in table 5 the uncertainty of the linear fitting is instead slightly larger than winter as shown by the wider confidence intervals fig 11 presents results for parameters of the gpd fitted to the annual pot rainfall data interestingly the shape parameter ξ seems to be characterized by an increasing relation with elevation fig 11a and b however r2 is low table 5 and the uncertainty of the linear fitting is relatively large especially for large z the spatial pattern of α0 and its relation with z fig 11c and d display a mixed behavior of what has been found in winter and summer while there is a general tendency for α0 to rise from south to north this pattern is less organized than the winter one fig 9b due to the effect of summertime rainfall events that are distributed more randomly in space fig 10c as found in both seasons ζ0 also increases from southwest to northeast and is controlled by orography fig 11e and f the mixed behavior at annual scale is also reflected in the values of the regression parameters reported in table 5 which are intermediate between those estimated in the two seasons again the narrow confidence intervals of fig 11d and f show that eq 8 and the linear regression capture rather well the relations linking α0 and ζ0 with z respectively 5 discussion 5 1 comparison with noaa atlas 14 the analyses conducted in this study are based on a dense network of 240 gauges distributed in central arizona and thus they can give insight on the spatial variability of rainfall extremes and support the design of civil infrastructure however since the length of the analyzed records is in most cases shorter than 30 years the reliability of the gpd in the region should be assessed through a comparison with existing studies based on long term records for this aim the quantiles of the gpd were compared with those obtained from noaa14 bonnin et al 2006 in arizona the daily idf curves from noaa14 have been obtained by i fitting the gev to long term up to 94 years rainfall records of a sparse network of 270 stations covering the entire state and ii applying regionalization techniques based on l moments hosking and wallis 1997 to obtain more robust estimates of the gev parameters recently keefer et al 2016 estimated the idf curves applying the lognormal distribution to records of a dense network of gauges in southeast arizona a region close to the study site of this paper and found minimal differences with noaa14 fig 12 shows the scatterplots between the quantiles xt for the return periods t 10 100 and 1000 years obtained from noaa14 at each gauge location and those derived from i the gpd fitted to the annual record and ii the hybrid model based on the mixture of the summer and winter rainfall distributions since the record lengths of ncei and noaa14 gauges are comparable the scatterplots have been reported separately for the ncei and fcdmc networks to isolate the effect of the sample size for the gpd and hybrid models the 90 confidence intervals characterizing the sampling uncertainty have also been reported these were built with the monte carlo simulations illustrated in appendix e the root mean square errors rmses and mean percent errors for each case are also presented in table 6 the comparison between the quantiles at the ncei gauges reveals that the differences between noaa14 and the methods based on the gpd are relatively small with percent errors rmse ranging from 8 to 3 6 5 to 15 9 mm the confidence intervals intersect the 1 1 line in almost all cases and are quite narrow indicating low sampling uncertainty as a consequence when applied to long records both the gpd and gev distributions have similar ability to represent the daily rainfall extremes in the region for both networks the gpd and hybrid model underestimate the quantiles of noaa14 for t 10 years the percent error is reduced for t 100 years and negligible for t 1000 years except for the hybrid model in the ncei network furthermore as t increases the gpd and hybrid model tend to return larger ranges of quantiles for a given value of xt estimated by noaa14 in addition to potential differences due to the methodologies this is an indication that the gpd and hybrid model are able to capture the spatial variability of the rainfall extremes with higher details as they have been applied on a denser network of gauges finally as reported in table 6 the rmses and percent errors computed for the gpd fitted to the annual records are lower than those returned by the hybrid distribution which only accounts for the contribution of summer and winter data and thus may not be able to represent the entire range of observed extreme events moreover while for both distributions the confidence intervals intersect the 1 1 line in the majority of the cases their width is significantly larger i e uncertainty is higher for the hybrid model since it depends on a larger number of parameters as a consequence the gpd fitted to the annual pot rainfall data with bias corrected parameters is recommended for the estimation of design storms in engineering applications 5 2 comparison with previous studies on the distributions of seasonal rainfall extremes results of the seasonal analyses presented here are consistent with previous studies conducted in different regions kozubowski et al 2009 investigated whether daily annual rainfall records from north america follow an exponential distribution or a gpd with heavy tail and cavanaugh et al 2015 extended this analysis using a global dataset these authors found that i heavy tails are mostly found in regions and seasons where multiple types of synoptic systems occur and ii in areas dominated by a single type of weather event the distribution is mainly exponential the seasonal analyses of villarini 2012 and sk14 based on the gev distribution and the gpd respectively reached similar conclusions other studies focused instead on the utility of seasonal statistical models i e models where parameters vary with the season allamano et al 2011 showed that for models based on pot approaches disregarding the seasonality of rainfall extremes and using models where all data are pooled together may lead to significant underestimation of design values on the contrary they found that the role of seasonality is negligible for bm models rasmussen and rosbjerg 1991 compared seasonal and nonseasonal flood models based on nonclustered poissonian occurrence times and exponentially distributed exceedances using synthetic experiments where the strength of the seasonality was varied these authors showed that i simple nonseasonal models may be preferable when the seasonality is weak and ii data from the dominant seasons should be merged to apply a one seasonal model when the seasonality is pronounced overall previous studies support and provide physical explanations for the results found for central arizona the exponential distribution was demonstrated to be appropriate for modeling wintertime daily rainfall extremes which are mainly caused by a single type of synoptic pattern consisting of cold fronts driven by westerly flow from the pacific ocean in contrast the distribution of daily extremes was found to be heavy tailed during the summer monsoon season when multiple convective thunderstorms with short lifetime 1 h occur over one day the time scale here analyzed since these storms are originated by gulf surges of moisture associated with different synoptic patterns e g bordoni and stevens 2006 favors and abatzoglou 2013 the heavy tailed behavior could be caused by the superposition of diverse types of storms further investigations based on the examination of synoptic patterns derived from reanalysis products would be however needed to support this empirical evidence 5 3 utility for climate change studies projections of several climate models suggest that a warmer climate will impact occurrence and intensity of hydrologic extremes however the uncertainty of these projections is still significant especially at regional or local scales e g frei et al 2006 kao and ganguly 2011 piras et al 2016 the investigation of rainfall extremes at seasonal scale conducted here could be used as a diagnostic tool to assess the ability of climate models to capture the physical processes leading to extreme events under current climate conditions e g tripathi and dominguez 2013 as discussed in the previous section synoptic systems that are dominant in specific seasons can lead to distinct probability distributions of rainfall extremes whose characteristics e g the shape parameter should be reproduced by the climate models this is a critical step to test their skill to simulate extreme events under future warmer conditions and eventually reduce the uncertainty the use of a dense network of gauges and the study of the effect of location and orography on parameters of the gpd can support the development and refinement of downscaling tools aimed at increasing the utility of climate model outputs for example mamalakis et al 2017 have recently proposed a parametric approach based on the gpd to correct the bias and downscale in space the daily rainfall simulated by climate models this methodology has been tested in the mediterranean island of sardinia italy and demonstrated to be more accurate and less sensitive to the calibration period as compared to non parametric approaches that have been widely used in the past e g maurer and hidalgo 2008 maraun et al 2010 gudmundsson et al 2012 results found in central arizona can be utilized to further test the skill of this methodology in a new location and improve it by incorporating the relations between model parameters and local terrain features 6 conclusions the gpd was utilized to investigate the annual and seasonal distributions of daily rainfall extremes in central arizona as well as their spatial variability using a dense network of gauges recent methodological advancements were applied to assess the suitability of the gpd hypothesis improve the estimation of its parameters and limit the bias due to short sample sizes in this region it was found that the seasonal distributions of daily rainfall extremes are different in summer and winter seasons which are characterized by markedly different synoptic systems these distributions can be merged through a simple hybrid probability distribution to model the daily extremes at annual scale organized spatial patterns mainly controlled by elevation were observed for parameter α 0 controlling the mean of the distributions in contrast orography plays a negligible influence on the variability of parameter ξ controlling the shape of the upper tail finally in this region it was found that the design values estimated with pot models are similar to those provided by noaa14 based on bm approaches results of this work i increase the knowledge of daily extreme rainfall in the region and improve the modeling capability at higher spatial resolution ii provide tools to evaluate the ability of climate models to reproduce extreme events and iii support application and development of spatial downscaling routines the methodologies proposed are broadly applicable to other regions including urban areas where rainfall records of dense networks of gauges are becoming increasingly available acknowledgments the author thanks dr elena volpi and dr francesco serinaldi for their in depth reviews that helped to significantly improve the quality of paper stephen d waters from the flood control district of the maricopa county is also thanked for providing the rainfall data of the network prof roberto deidda is also thanked for his suggestions fcdmc data are also available at the website http www fcd maricopa gov 3847 flood control district and ncei data can be downloaded at https www ncdc noaa gov data access appendix a the method used to compute the field significance for the autocorrelation and mann kendall tests is based on bootstrap resampling and was adapted from guerreiro et al 2014 a total of 1000 samples were generated by sampling the rainfall records in the time period 1980 2013 each sample was created through an iterative procedure based on a random selection of days without replacement for each day the rainfall observations at all available stations were extracted in order to preserve the spatial correlation among the stations the random selection of days was repeated until the number of days with data for each station was at least equal to the sample size of the corresponding observed record once the sample was built the autocorrelation and mann kendall tests were applied at 5 significance level at each location and the percent of gauges where the test failed was recorded this resulted in 1000 values that were used to find the 95th percentile defining the critical value for assessing the test significance appendix b the mtm uses a hierarchal approach for estimating parameters of eq 3 consisting of the following steps i parameters α 0 ξ and ζ 0 of eq 3 are estimated for a range of thresholds u ii the median value of ξ across the thresholds is calculated and used to constrain a second estimate of α 0 and ζ 0 for the same range of thresholds u iii the median value of α 0 is then calculated and used to constrain a third estimate of ζ 0 and iv the median value of ζ 0 is finally computed the median values of ξ α 0 and ζ 0 calculated in steps ii iv are the final parameters appendix c the application of the technique proposed by deidda and puliga 2006 and here adopted to account for the application of goodness of fit test with discretized data involved the following steps the gpd was first fitted to the original data and used to randomly generate an ensemble of 1000 samples with the same size of the original record for each random sample the same rounding off rule of the original data in this case discretization at 1 mm resolution was applied the gpd was estimated in each sample and the metrics of the three goodness of fit tests were calculated this resulted in 1000 values for each metric that were used to calculate the acceptance regions of the tests at a significance level of 5 appendix d the monte carlo experiments designed to build the confidence intervals of the analytical equations between elevation and parameters of the gpd and exponential distribution eq 8 or linear regression consisted of the following steps for each gauge i a sample with the same size of the original record was randomly generated from the gpd or exponential distribution with bias corrected parameters and ii parameters were re estimated on the randomly generated sample the relations linking the parameters with z were fitted again on the re estimated parameter values of all gauges a total of 1000 experiments were conducted and the 90 confidence intervals of the relations were calculated appendix e the confidence intervals for the quantiles xt with t being the return period of the gpd and hybrid distributions were obtained through monte carlo experiments where i for each gauge 1000 samples with the same size of the original record were randomly generated from the gpd or hybrid distributions with bias corrected parameters ii parameters were re estimated on the randomly generated samples and the quantiles xt were calculated and iii the 5th and 95th quantiles were extracted from the empirical distribution of xt 
7384,this study uses daily rainfall records of a dense network of 240 gauges in central arizona to gain insights on i the variability of the seasonal distributions of rainfall extremes ii how the seasonal distributions affect the shape of the annual distribution and iii the presence of spatial patterns and orographic control for these distributions for this aim recent methodological advancements in peak over threshold analysis and application of the generalized pareto distribution gpd were used to assess the suitability of the gpd hypothesis and improve the estimation of its parameters while limiting the effect of short sample sizes the distribution of daily rainfall extremes was found to be heavy tailed i e gpd shape parameter ξ 0 during the summer season dominated by convective monsoonal thunderstorms the exponential distribution a special case of gpd with ξ 0 was instead showed to be appropriate for modeling wintertime daily rainfall extremes mainly caused by cold fronts transported by westerly flow the annual distribution exhibited a mixed behavior with lighter upper tails than those found in summer a hybrid model mixing the two seasonal distributions was demonstrated capable of reproducing the annual distribution organized spatial patterns mainly controlled by elevation were observed for the gpd scale parameter while ξ did not show any clear control of location or orography the quantiles returned by the gpd were found to be very similar to those provided by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa atlas 14 which used the generalized extreme value gev distribution results of this work are useful to improve statistical modeling of daily rainfall extremes at high spatial resolution and provide diagnostic tools for assessing the ability of climate models to simulate extreme events keywords rainfall extremes peak over threshold analysis generalized pareto distribution seasonal extremes annual extremes spatial variability 1 introduction the statistical characterization and modeling of rainfall extremes are crucial to support hydrologic engineering and climate studies with high societal economic and environmental impacts they are needed to inform hydrologic modeling of floods norbiato et al 2009 golian et al 2010 hapuarachchi et al 2011 alfieri et al 2016 which are one of the most severe natural hazards causing significant losses in terms of both property and fatalities ashley and ashley 2008 di baldassarre et al 2010 gochis et al 2015 peden et al 2017 statistical models of extreme rainfall are critical to design and manage infrastructures e g madsen et al 2002 bonnin et al 2006 langousis and veneziano 2007 haddad et al 2011 which are becoming increasingly interdependent and then more vulnerable to extreme events rinaldi et al 2001 hasan and foliente 2015 in addition several climate projections wilby and wigley 2002 frei et al 2006 wuebbles et al 2014 prein et al 2017 and theoretical arguments frei et al 1998 trenberth 1999 emori and brown 2005 suggest that intensity and occurrence of hydrologic extremes can be significantly affected by global warming as a result the analysis of historical rainfall records is essential to evaluate the ability of climate models to capture heavy rainfall in future scenarios the statistical investigation of rainfall extreme intensities over a given duration has been mainly carried out by analyzing the frequency of two types of data the block maxima bm and the peak over threshold pot series the bm series are built by extracting the maximum rainfall rate over a specified time window usually one year while the pot data are obtained by retaining all records above a given threshold u for an infinite sample size the theoretical distribution of the bm is the generalized extreme value gev fisher and tippett 1928 gnedenko 1943 coles 2001 while the limit distribution for pot data over a high enough threshold belongs to the domain of the generalized pareto distribution gpd balkema and de haan 1974 pickands 1975 the extreme value theory evt davison 1990 coles 2001 salvadori and de michele 2001 and papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2013 provides theoretical evidence that links parameters of the gev distribution and the gpd specifically both distributions have a shape parameter that controls the upper tail and under suitable conditions the evt shows that the shape parameter of the gev distribution and the corresponding gpd are the same since the annual bm only retains one value per year their frequency analysis requires long term datasets usually 30 years to robustly estimate the distribution parameters several studies have adopted the gev model to characterize and simulate annual rainfall maxima at daily scale in many areas of the world e g nadarajah 2005 aryal et al 2009 papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2013 villarini et al 2011a villarini 2012 on the other hand the pot series is able to preserve a larger portion of the hydrologic information available in the dataset so that relatively shorter records may be sufficient to analyze this type of data previous work has shown that the gpd is able to successfully reproduce daily rainfall extremes by analyzing pot series observed in different climatic settings madsen et al 1997a b 2002 deidda and puliga 2006 beguería and vicente serrano 2006 beguería et al 2009 serinaldi and kilsby 2014 moreover the efficiency and lower data requirement of the gpd have stimulated studies devoted to test improve existing or develop new methods for analyzing pot data and fitting the gpd specifically work has been focused on i the comparison of graphical and numerical methods to identify a proper threshold u deidda and puliga 2006 langousis et al 2016 solari et al 2017 ii the evaluation of different parameter estimators de michele and salvadori 2005 deidda and puliga 2009 iii the development of a threshold invariant method for estimating parameters of the gpd deidda 2010 and iv the analysis of the bias on the estimation of the gpd shape parameter due to the sample size serinaldi and kilsby 2014 this study uses some these methodological advancements on pot analysis and application of the gpd to address three research questions that so far have received limited attention including i how does the distribution of rainfall extremes vary with the seasons when these are characterized by markedly different weather systems ii how do the seasonal distributions affect the shape of the annual distribution and iii how do annual and seasonal distributions vary in space and are affected by orography to answer these questions statistical analyses of daily rainfall extremes are conducted at annual and seasonal scales using a dense network of rain gauges in central arizona fig 1 this region of the desert southwest united states has experienced rapid urbanization and population growth over the last few decades mostly concentrated in the phoenix metropolitan area chow et al 2012 as a result of this land cover and land use change the vulnerability to flooding has increased under both summer monsoonal thunderstorms adams and comrie 1997 and wintertime rain episodes associated with cold fronts sheppard et al 2002 rivera et al 2014 despite this the statistical characterization of rainfall extremes in this region has received little attention with the notable exception of the updated version of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration atlas 14 noaa14 bonnin et al 2006 that provides the intensity durationfrequency idf curves adopted for infrastructure design and management the research questions are here investigated using records of a dense network of gauges installed by the flood control district of the maricopa county fcdmc over the last 30 years fig 1b this dataset is complemented by long term observations of gauges of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa national center for environmental information ncei after demonstrating that the gpd is a suitable distribution to model the pot daily rainfall extremes at annual and seasonal scales its parameters are bias corrected to account for short sample sizes following the recent findings of papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2013 and serinaldi and kilsby 2014 next it is shown how the gpd distribution of daily rainfall extremes varies in the summer and winter seasons which are dominated by markedly different synoptic patterns leading to heavy rainfall a hybrid model that mixes the two seasonal distributions is then proposed and tested to reproduce the annual distribution subsequently the spatial variability of the gpd parameters is investigated along with the effect of orography which has been shown to exert an important control on rainfall properties and regimes in central arizona e g adams and comrie 1997 mascaro 2017 as well as on the shape of the rainfall extreme distributions in specific regions of united states padoan et al 2012 reich and shaby 2012 and at global scale cavanaugh and gershunov 2015 finally the implications of the study for engineering applications and climate change analyses are discussed while this work is focused on central arizona the methodologies proposed are broadly applicable to other regions to gain insights on the seasonal and spatial variability of rainfall extremes improve the ability to model them and assess the skill of climate models 2 study area and dataset the study area is located in the state of arizona fig 1a in southwestern united states as shown in the digital elevation model of fig 1b the area includes two distinct physiographic regions with a sharp elevation range the first and largest is part of the basin and range province which is a region at lower elevation from 200 to 600 m a s l that includes the phoenix metropolitan area surrounded by the sonoran desert and crop fields the second region is instead part of the transition zone to the colorado plateau here elevation is much higher with peaks reaching up to 2000 m a s l in the mogollon rim located in the northeastern corner in central arizona the constant presence of a subtropical high pressure ridge guarantees dry and warm conditions all year around sheppard et al 2002 for example in phoenix the annual mean temperature and precipitation are 24 c and 204 mm respectively as obtained from the ncei records from 1970 to 2000 climate is also characterized by a strong seasonality due to different synoptic conditions dominating weather in summer and winter which lead to a bimodal rainfall regime the months from july to september are more humid due to the occurrence of the north american monsoon when water vapor is transported from the eastern tropical pacific ocean and gulf of california and to a lower extent from the gulf of mexico adams and comrie 1997 during the monsoon convective thunderstorms with high rainfall intensities very short duration 1 h and small spatial extent occur relatively frequently according to a diurnally modulated cycle balling and brazel 1987 these storms accounts on average for 33 of the annual total rainfall but this percentage varies considerably from year to year the months from late fall to early summer are instead much drier during this period dominated by westerly flow occasional cold fronts generate storm systems that occupy large areas and may last for multiple days while these systems are in general characterized by low to moderate rain intensities in some cases they may include convective cells with higher rates sheppard et al 2002 a recent study by mascaro 2017 analyzed a number of statistical properties of rainfall in central arizona using records from the gauges of the fcdmc network analyses were conducted separately for the summer from june to september and winter from november to march seasons the main results that are useful for the goals of this paper include the following i due to its widespread nature wintertime rainfall exhibits higher inter gauge correlation as compared to the more intermittent summer storms for example the characteristic spatial scales of daily rainfall are 50 km in summer and 500 km in winter as measured through the correlation distances of the rainfall signals ii in both seasons elevation controls the rainfall seasonal accumulation that for summer varies linearly from 50 mm at 200 m a s l to 200 mm at 2300 m a s l iii a simple investigation of the seasonal climatology of maximum rainfall intensities revealed that at daily scale their magnitude does not differ substantially in summer and winter and is affected by orography this study uses the same rainfall records collected by the fcdmc network analyzed by mascaro 2017 the fcdmc network has been installed since the beginning of the 1980s to monitor in real time the movement of regional storm systems in the phoenix metropolitan region and surrounding areas as shown in fig 1b most of the gauges are located within the maricopa county an additional set of gauges has been also deployed in neighboring counties mostly the yavapai county to capture larger systems and areas at higher elevation where storms can cause floods and flash floods in the urban areas downstream fig 1c shows how the number of gauges has constantly increased in time reaching a total of 310 the network covers an area of 29600 km2 with a density of 1 gauge every 100 km2 which increases up to 4 3 gauges in urban areas depending on date of installation and periods of missing data the record lengths vary from 5 to 34 years over the period from 1980 to 2013 fig 1b the gauges span a wide range of elevation from 220 to 2325 m a s l fig 1d shows the number of gauges falling in 10 elevation bins covering the interval from 200 to 2000 m a s l the relation has been plotted with a continuous back line using all 310 gauges currently a total of 263 47 gauges are located at elevation lower higher than 800 m since the sample length affects the statistical analyses on rainfall extremes these were performed on a subset of the 220 gauges with 15 years of observations the choice of 15 years has been considered a good compromise between the needs to i support the statistical significance of the analyses and ii capture a large range of elevations and locations in the region the dashed black line in fig 1d shows how the elevation distribution for the subsample of 220 gauges resembles well the distribution of the entire network given the limited record length of the fcdmc gauges longer rainfall time series from the ncei database were also acquired focusing on the 20 gauges of this region with 30 years of observations of which at least 15 are included in the period 1980 2013 the location of these stations is also reported in fig 1b along with the corresponding record length which reaches up to 98 years the gray line in fig 1d shows instead that the ncei gauges are all located at relatively low elevation 800 m mostly within the urban areas the rain gauges of the fcdmc are of the tipping bucket type with an accumulated rain depth of 1 mm which causes problems of quantization of the rainfall signal deidda and puliga 2006 2009 langousis et al 2016 that need to be properly taken into account in the analyses as described in the next section the raw rainfall data containing the tipping instants in seconds were acquired from the fcdmc database processed according to the technique described in mascaro et al 2013 appendix a and then aggregated at daily resolution the records of the ncei stations were instead directly downloaded at daily resolution differently from the fcdmc records the ncei data have a precision of 0 1 mm 3 methods analyses of daily rainfall extremes were conducted on the records of 240 gauges of the fcdmc and ncei networks at annual and seasonal scale the latter includes the summer monsoon period which occurs from july to september and the winter season defined from november to march as in mascaro 2017 the methodologies applied to evaluate the suitability of the gpd hypothesis to model the annual and seasonal daily rainfall extremes and estimate its parameters are described in the following subsections for clarity of exposition the technique adopted to correct the bias in the estimation of the gpd shape parameter due to the sample size and the hybrid model used to mix the seasonal distributions are instead directly illustrated in the results section 3 1 autocorrelation and trend analysis accounting for field significance a set of preliminary analyses was conducted on the pot times series to assess the statistical independence of the samples prior to fitting the gpd distribution first the presence of temporal correlation was investigated testing the significance of the lag 1 autocorrelation computing the kendall correlation coefficient next the existence of monotonically increasing or decreasing trends was analyzed using the mann kendall test mann 1945 both tests have been utilized in similar studies e g villarini et al 2011a b villarini 2012 guerreiro et al 2014 serinaldi and kilsby 2014 here they have been applied with a significance level α 5 since the gauges are geographically closed and the spatial correlation among the rainfall observations can be significant especially in winter mascaro 2017 results of multiple statistical tests may be affected by the problem known as test multiplicity wilks 2011 this relates to the fact that when a test is applied collectively and independently to n gauges with a significance level α the null hypothesis may be rejected on average for α z n gauges while holding true for the entire set of stations the local significance level α cannot then be used to evaluate the test applied to all stations because the chance of detecting a false change is actually larger than α the global or field significance should be instead calculated wilks 2011 summarizes the main approaches that have been proposed to estimate the field significance for independent and spatially correlated fields or stations with focus on applications in atmospheric sciences previous studies where the field significance has been estimated on hydrologic records include the work of douglas et al 2000 and guerreiro et al 2014 and references therein here to account for the spatial correlation among the gauges a method based on bootstrap resampling was used to determine the field significance for the autocorrelation and mann kendall tests as in guerreiro et al 2014 the method is described in appendix a 3 2 the generalized pareto distribution the generalized pareto distribution gpd was used to model statistically the daily rainfall extremes the cumulative distribution function fu x of the gpd derived from the exceedances of x above the threshold u both in mm is defined as 1 f u x f u x α u ξ 1 1 ξ x u α u 1 ξ ξ 0 1 exp x u α u ξ 0 where ξ is the shape parameter and α u 0 in mm is the scale parameter the shape parameter ξ controls the upper tail of the distribution and then the tendency to generate heavy extremes for ξ 0 the gpd reduces to the exponential distribution for ξ 0 the gpd is heavy tailed or subexponential and for ξ 0 the gpd is short tailed with an upper bound value equal to u α u ξ here parameters of the gpd were estimated using the multiple threshold method mtm proposed by deidda 2010 in this approach the following relation is used for the cdf of nonnegative rainfall data f x 2 f x 1 ζ 0 ζ 0 f 0 x x 0 where ζ 0 pr x 0 and f0 x is the cdf of x 0 if f0 x is modeled with the gpd i e u 0 mm eq 2 becomes 3 f x f x α 0 ξ ζ 0 1 ζ 0 1 ξ x α 0 1 ξ ξ 0 1 ζ 0 exp x α 0 ξ 0 for x 0 where the shape parameter α 0 is linked to α u through the relation α 0 α u ξ u the mtm is based on a hierarchal approach for estimating parameters of 3 which is briefly summarized in appendix b as shown by deidda 2010 serinaldi and kilsby 2014 langousis et al 2016 and mamalakis et al 2017 the mtm is able to minimize uncertainty and bias associated with the threshold selection and to reduce the distortions due to quantization of the rainfall signal the mtm was applied with the probability weighted moments pwm estimator hosking and wallis 1997 which resulted to be less biased and more efficient than the maximum likelihood method according to monte carlo simulations where gpd samples were generated adopting similar ranges of parameters and size of the analyzed rainfall records 3 3 goodness of fit tests accounting for field significance the anderson darling cramér von mises and kolmogorov smirnov goodness of fit tests were applied to assess the suitability of the gpd to model the data since the rainfall records of the fcdmc network are discretized with a resolution of 1 mm the procedure based on monte carlo simulations proposed by deidda and puliga 2006 was followed to calculate the acceptance region of each test this procedure is described in appendix c as for the mann kendall and autocorrelation tests the problem of field significance also arises when multiple goodness of fit tests are applied if the hypothesis of spatial independence among the gauges is assumed the method proposed by livezey and chen 1983 can be adopted to compute the field significance this technique assumes that the number of failures is distributed according to a binomial distribution with a number of trials equal to the number of gauges and probability of event occurrence i e the rejection of the null hypothesis equal to the significance level of each test to account for the presence of spatial dependence this method can be adapted by using the beta binomial distribution as in serinaldi et al 2018 this is a compound distribution based on the binomial distribution with a probability of event occurrence that is not fixed but that varies based on a beta distribution as explained by serinaldi et al 2018 appendix b parameters of the beta binomial distribution are estimated as a function of the constant probability of event occurrence assumed in the standard binomial distribution and the mean cross correlation between the rainfall time series of all gauges 4 results 4 1 evaluation of the gpd hypothesis before testing the suitability of the gpd the hypothesis that the samples of rainfall records are independent and identically distributed was evaluated for this aim the lag 1 autocorrelation and mann kendall tests were applied to the annual and seasonal time series for the threshold u 4 mm corresponding to 95th percentiles of the empirical rainfall distribution of most gauges table 1 shows the percent of gauges including both fcdmc and ncei where the lag 1 autocorrelation and the presence of trends were found to be statistically significant at 95 confidence level if the test multiplicity is not taken into account the null hypothesis should be rejected if these percentages are 5 which happens in most cases however when the field significance and spatial correlation are taken into account the critical values calculated through the bootstrap resampling experiments of appendix a are larger than or in some cases very close to the observed percentages of rejections table 1 based on these results there is no evidence of the presence of autocorrelation and trend in the analyzed records moreover it is worth noticing that a recent study of serinaldi et al 2018 poses serious concerns on the utility of tests for trend detection in exploratory phase these authors recommend instead their adoption to verify hypotheses on data behavior that are guided by the underlying physics and validated through independent observations the suitability of the gpd was then preliminarily explored using the l moments ratio diagrams hosking 1990 fig 2 shows the relation between l skewness and l kurtosis for a range of distributions see caption for details along with the sampling values calculated from the annual summer and winter records of ncei and fcdmc networks with the threshold u 4 mm the corresponding means of the sample l moments are also reported it is apparent that for both networks the gpd appears to be the best candidate to model the pot samples above a high threshold the mean values of the sample l moments reveal additional insights first the behavior of summer and winter records is different especially for ncei second the annual mean lies between the summer and winter averages third the average of the sample l moments for the winter records is located very close to the l moments of the exponential distribution a special case of the gpd these preliminary findings will be further explored and discussed in the next sections 4 2 estimation and bias correction of gpd parameters since the l moments ratio diagrams supported the suitability of the gpd this distribution was fitted to the full records of the gauges using the mtm approach to estimate its parameters table 2 reports mean standard deviation of the estimates of the shape parameter ξ across the gauges of ncei and fcdmc networks for the annual and seasonal periods original the values of ξ are in most cases 0 confirming the evidence found in previous studies that the distribution of extreme daily rainfall tends to be characterized by heavy tails e g deidda and puliga 2006 villarini et al 2011a b papalexiou et al 2013 serinaldi and kilsby 2014 cavanaugh et al 2015 langousis et al 2016 as shown in fig 1b the record length of each gauge is different implying that the ξ estimates have been obtained for different sample sizes recently papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2013 and serinaldi and kilsby 2014 hereafter pk13 and sk14 respectively have studied the effect of the sample size on the shape parameter ξ of the gev distribution and gpd respectively proposing empirical equations to correct the bias due to the sample length a similar approach was adopted here using some of the numerical findings of these two studies that analyzed a larger number of gauges with longer records fig 3 shows the relation between the ξ estimates and the sample size n since the application of mtm involves the computation of pot data over a range of thresholds each associated with a different sample size see appendix b the value of n was obtained as the mean of all sample lengths from fig 3 one can note i the much larger size of the ncei records and ii the reduced spread of the ξ estimates as n increases regarding the latter point it is important to highlight that the number of stations with larger n n 500 and 200 at annual and seasonal scales respectively is significantly lower than that of the gauges with shorter records this implies that the uncertainty of the ξ values for large n is higher despite this the assumption of reduced spread of ξ could be considered reasonable based on similar findings on larger datasets reported by pk13 and sk14 assuming that the true distribution of ξ for n is normal with mean μξ and standard deviation σξ then the distribution for a finite n can also be assumed normal with mean μξ n and standard deviation σξ n as in sk14 the following equations were used to estimate μξ n and σξ n 4a μ ξ n μ ξ b μ n c μ 4b σ ξ n σ ξ b σ n c σ in pk13 and sk14 the asymptotic values μξ and σξ were estimated along with bμ cμ bσ and cσ by fitting eqs 4a and 4b to all points which were uniformly distributed across the range of analyzed n values here since most of the points were available for low n μξ and σξ were estimated prior to the fitting specifically the values of μξ in each time period were estimated as the mean of the ξ estimates at the ncei gauges see mean values of original in table 2 as these exhibit an asymptotic behavior across a large range of high n values as shown in table 2 the value of μξ estimated from the ncei dataset is larger in summer as compared to winter consistent with sk14 who fitted the gpd in the same seasons to the pot data exceeding the 98th percentile of gauges in europe north america and australia for the annual time period the estimated μξ 0 091 see table 2 is instead very close to the asymptotic values of 0 15 and 0 114 obtained by koutsoyiannis 2004b and pk13 respectively applying the gev distribution at annual scale for σξ given the limited number of gauges analyzed here the value of 0 045 reported by pk13 was adopted in all cases as it is based on the analyses of 15 137 gauges parameters bμ cμ bσ and cσ were then estimated for each time period by i dividing the points of fig 3 into 15 classes with equal number of points ii calculating the mean and standard deviation of ξ for each class and the corresponding average of n and iii fitting eqs 4a and 4b to the 15 points of the classes the estimated values of bμ cμ bσ and cσ are displayed in table 3 while the μξ n and σξ n relations are plotted in fig 3 with solid and dashed lines respectively as a next step the μξ n and σξ n relations were used to correct the bias of the ξ estimates by applying the unbiased estimator proposed by papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2013 5 ξ n σ ξ σ ξ l ξ μ ξ l μ ξ where ξ is the mtm estimate of the shape parameter and ξ n is the bias corrected value the mean and standard deviation across the gauges of the bias corrected ξ are also reported in table 2 consistent with sk14 the application of eq 5 led to an increase of the mean and reduction of the variance the mtm method constrained with the bias corrected values of ξ was then applied to re estimate the other parameters of the gpd the goodness of fit tests were applied to assess the suitability of the gpd with bias corrected parameters results are presented in table 4 columns labeled gpd which shows the percent of stations where each test was rejected at the local 5 significance level if the hypothesis of spatial independence is assumed the method based on the binomial distribution with a number of trials equal to 240 the number of gauges of both networks and probability of event occurrence of 0 05 leads to a total of 18 rejections or 7 5 at the global 5 significance level if the spatial dependence is taken into account via the beta binomial distribution see section 3 3 the number of rejections rises to 84 50 and 94 or 35 0 20 8 and 39 2 for the annual summer and winter periods respectively as shown in table 4 these percent thresholds are never exceeded overall the probability charts of fig 2 and the goodness of fit tests indicate that the gpd with bias corrected parameters is a good candidate to represent the distribution of daily rainfall extremes this is further confirmed by fig 4 which shows examples of the comparison between the empirical survival function and the gpd fitted to the annual summer and winter records of one and two gauges of ncei and fcdmc networks respectively spanning different elevations see figure caption one can note i the excellent ability of the gpd to represent the empirical distributions ii the heavier tails larger ξ of the distributions in summer iii the tendency of the gpd to approach the exponential distribution in winter ξ close to 0 and iv the intermediate behavior at annual scale the differences between the distributions of the daily rainfall extremes in the two seasons are further investigated in the next section 4 3 seasonal variability of the probability distribution of daily rainfall extremes the seasonal behavior of the distributions of the daily rainfall extremes was analyzed first by plotting in fig 5 the frequency distributions of the annual and seasonal bias corrected shape parameter ξ of all gauges the distribution of ξ in each time period appears to be bell shaped thus confirming the findings obtained by papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2013 with the gev distribution on a larger dataset in summer the daily extremes are characterized by heavier tails as compared to winter with mean ξ of 0 145 and 0 005 respectively when considering the annual records the behavior is intermediate with an average ξ of 0 093 the standard deviation of the ξ estimates at all gauges is instead rather constant across all time periods with a value of 0 050 as expected after the bias correction since the ξ estimates for the winter records are distributed around a mean value close to 0 the hypothesis that the winter pot rainfall data are drawn from the exponential distribution was evaluated by fitting the gpd with ξ 0 and then applying the goodness of fit tests for comparison this was also done for the summer records results are shown in table 4 columns labeled exp the percent rejections in winter are below the critical threshold of 39 2 at the global significance level of 5 while those in summer are larger than the corresponding threshold of 20 8 as a consequence the exponential distribution can be considered an alternative good candidate to model daily rainfall extremes in winter while it does not capture properly the summer distributions that tend to be heavy tailed to further support this fig 6 presents the q q plots of the gpd with bias corrected ξ and the exponential distribution ξ 0 fitted to the winter records of the three gauges displayed in fig 4 it is apparent that the differences are minimal 4 4 hybrid probability distribution for annual daily rainfall extremes prior studies e g kozubowski et al 2009 villarini 2012 cavanaugh et al 2015 have suggested that the annual distribution of the daily rainfall extremes could be obtained by mixing the distributions of different rainfall generation mechanisms which can be distinct in each season this hypothesis was tested here by evaluating whether in central arizona the shape of the annual distribution could be reproduced by mixing the exponential distribution and the heavy tailed gpd that were found to be suitable to model the winter and summer extreme intensities respectively however the summer and winter seasons defined here do not include the months from april to june and of october which are usually very dry mascaro 2017 but where weather events leading to extreme rainfall could still occur pool 2005 two sets of analyses were then carried out to assess the importance of each season summer winter and other months on the distribution of the annual rainfall extremes both analyses were conducted using the records from 1980 to 2013 to have a common climatic reference the first test aims at identifying the seasons when the largest daily rainfall intensities were observed more frequently on an annual basis for each gauge the daily rainfall data of a given year were sorted and the seasons when the largest m values occurred were identified using data of all years the number of times when each season was found in the m ranks was counted and converted in percentage fig 7 a shows results for m 15 obtained by averaging the percentages across all gauges within each year the highest daily rainfall rates were observed more frequently in winter 52 of the times followed by the summer season 35 these events occurred instead in a limited fraction of times 13 in the other months the second analysis was instead performed using the entire record of daily rainfall data with the goal of evaluating which season has the largest effect on the upper tail of the annual distribution of the daily extremes for each gauge the seasons when the largest 100 daily rainfall values occurred were identified next the percent of times when each season was found in the first 100 ranks was computed using data of all gauges results of this analysis are presented in fig 7b which shows that winter and summer time weather events led to the largest daily rainfall values in about 90 of the cases with a prevalence of events occurring in winter on average 52 as compared to summer 38 for all cases the fraction of events observed in the other months was instead quite low 10 the findings of fig 7 suggest that the contribution of the other months is negligible as a result a hybrid model mixing the summer and winter distributions was applied to simulate the annual distribution of the daily rainfall extremes the cdf of the hybrid model fhyb x is defined as 6 f hyb x α 0 w ζ 0 w α 0 s ξ s ζ 0 s p w p s p w f exp x α 0 w ζ 0 w p s f gpd x α 0 s ξ s ζ 0 s for x 0 where fexp x is the cdf of the exponential distribution 3 with parameters α0 w and ζ0 w estimated on winter records fgpd x is the cdf of the gpd 3 with parameters α0 s ξ s and ζ0 s estimated on summer records applying the bias correction for ξ s as explained in section 4 2 and pw and ps are the weights of the seasonal distributions estimated as 7a p w n w n w n s 7b p s n s n w n s 1 p w where nw 151 and ns 92 are the number of days of the winter and summer seasons respectively similar hybrid probability distributions were successfully applied to daily rainfall data by woolhiser and pegram 1979 woolhiser and roldán 1982 and foufoula georgiou and lettenmaier 1987 to model jointly low and high rain rates or rainfall occurrence the suitability of the hybrid distribution was assessed again through the application of the goodness of fit tests as illustrated in section 3 3 and appendix c a monte carlo approach was adopted to generate the critical level of each test in order to account for data quantization this required the generation of random samples extracted from the hybrid model for this aim a set of numbers ui i 1 n included between 0 and 1 was randomly generated from a uniform distribution then if ui pw ui pw the corresponding quantile was computed from the exponential distribution gpd results are presented in table 4 column labeled hybrid which shows that the percent rejection is always lower than the corresponding critical values at the 5 global significance level in addition performances of the hybrid distribution were compared with those of the gpd applied at annual scale by reporting in fig 8 the q q plots for the same three gauges displayed in previous figures the differences between the two distributions are small apart from slight discrepancies for the higher quantiles these are due to the fact that compound distributions tend to exhibit heavier tails than single distributions fitted to the same dataset see e g koutsoyiannis 2004a 4 5 spatial variability of the distribution of daily rainfall extremes and effect of elevation as a next step the spatial variability of the gpd parameters and their relation with gauge elevation were evaluated at seasonal and annual scale fig 9 shows results for parameters α0 and ζ0 of the exponential distribution fitted to the winter rainfall data fig 9a reveals that the scale parameter α0 which controls the mean of the distribution tends to increase from south to north this pattern is partially explained by elevation z as shown in fig 9b where α0 increases with z up to 1000 m a s l and then assumes a relatively constant mean value to interpret this relation the following equation was fitted to the data 8 α 0 z a a α 0 e bz where α 0 is the value of α0 for z 0 that was assumed equal to 4 mm based on values previously published e g beguería and vicente serrano 2006 deidda 2010 and a and b are parameters estimated via non linear fitting whose values are reported in table 5 the fraction of rainy days ζ0 grows from southwest to northeast fig 9c and is linearly related to z fig 9d consistent with the pattern found by mascaro 2017 for the annual totals table 5 reports parameters of the linear regression between ζ0 and z to explore the validity of the equations adopted to interpret the relations between z and parameters α0 and ζ0 the 90 confidence intervals of these curves were built through monte carlo experiments as described in appendix d as shown in fig 9b and d the confidence intervals of both curves are very narrow across all values of z thus confirming the robustness of the adopted analytical equations overall these results indicate that the intensity of wintertime daily rainfall extremes increases from the valley areas in the south to the mountainous regions in the northern portion of the domain results of the same analysis for parameters ξ α0 and ζ0 of the gpd fitted to the pot rainfall data in summer are displayed in fig 10 as previously discussed the distribution of extreme daily rainfall during the monsoon season is heavy tailed i e ξ 0 fig 10a and b show that the shape parameter ξ does not exhibit an organized spatial pattern and is not significantly controlled by orography as indicated by the very low coefficient of determination r2 and the relatively wide confidence intervals of the linear regression see appendix d which partially do not include the line fitted on the original data the values of the scale parameter α0 are rather scattered throughout the urbanized area and tend to slightly rise at higher elevation fig 10c and d this pattern is well captured by eq 8 as shown by the relatively narrow confidence intervals finally the portion of rainy days ζ0 displays a clear orographic control fig 10e and f that is stronger than the one found in winter as revealed by the higher r2 and slope of the regression line reported in table 5 the uncertainty of the linear fitting is instead slightly larger than winter as shown by the wider confidence intervals fig 11 presents results for parameters of the gpd fitted to the annual pot rainfall data interestingly the shape parameter ξ seems to be characterized by an increasing relation with elevation fig 11a and b however r2 is low table 5 and the uncertainty of the linear fitting is relatively large especially for large z the spatial pattern of α0 and its relation with z fig 11c and d display a mixed behavior of what has been found in winter and summer while there is a general tendency for α0 to rise from south to north this pattern is less organized than the winter one fig 9b due to the effect of summertime rainfall events that are distributed more randomly in space fig 10c as found in both seasons ζ0 also increases from southwest to northeast and is controlled by orography fig 11e and f the mixed behavior at annual scale is also reflected in the values of the regression parameters reported in table 5 which are intermediate between those estimated in the two seasons again the narrow confidence intervals of fig 11d and f show that eq 8 and the linear regression capture rather well the relations linking α0 and ζ0 with z respectively 5 discussion 5 1 comparison with noaa atlas 14 the analyses conducted in this study are based on a dense network of 240 gauges distributed in central arizona and thus they can give insight on the spatial variability of rainfall extremes and support the design of civil infrastructure however since the length of the analyzed records is in most cases shorter than 30 years the reliability of the gpd in the region should be assessed through a comparison with existing studies based on long term records for this aim the quantiles of the gpd were compared with those obtained from noaa14 bonnin et al 2006 in arizona the daily idf curves from noaa14 have been obtained by i fitting the gev to long term up to 94 years rainfall records of a sparse network of 270 stations covering the entire state and ii applying regionalization techniques based on l moments hosking and wallis 1997 to obtain more robust estimates of the gev parameters recently keefer et al 2016 estimated the idf curves applying the lognormal distribution to records of a dense network of gauges in southeast arizona a region close to the study site of this paper and found minimal differences with noaa14 fig 12 shows the scatterplots between the quantiles xt for the return periods t 10 100 and 1000 years obtained from noaa14 at each gauge location and those derived from i the gpd fitted to the annual record and ii the hybrid model based on the mixture of the summer and winter rainfall distributions since the record lengths of ncei and noaa14 gauges are comparable the scatterplots have been reported separately for the ncei and fcdmc networks to isolate the effect of the sample size for the gpd and hybrid models the 90 confidence intervals characterizing the sampling uncertainty have also been reported these were built with the monte carlo simulations illustrated in appendix e the root mean square errors rmses and mean percent errors for each case are also presented in table 6 the comparison between the quantiles at the ncei gauges reveals that the differences between noaa14 and the methods based on the gpd are relatively small with percent errors rmse ranging from 8 to 3 6 5 to 15 9 mm the confidence intervals intersect the 1 1 line in almost all cases and are quite narrow indicating low sampling uncertainty as a consequence when applied to long records both the gpd and gev distributions have similar ability to represent the daily rainfall extremes in the region for both networks the gpd and hybrid model underestimate the quantiles of noaa14 for t 10 years the percent error is reduced for t 100 years and negligible for t 1000 years except for the hybrid model in the ncei network furthermore as t increases the gpd and hybrid model tend to return larger ranges of quantiles for a given value of xt estimated by noaa14 in addition to potential differences due to the methodologies this is an indication that the gpd and hybrid model are able to capture the spatial variability of the rainfall extremes with higher details as they have been applied on a denser network of gauges finally as reported in table 6 the rmses and percent errors computed for the gpd fitted to the annual records are lower than those returned by the hybrid distribution which only accounts for the contribution of summer and winter data and thus may not be able to represent the entire range of observed extreme events moreover while for both distributions the confidence intervals intersect the 1 1 line in the majority of the cases their width is significantly larger i e uncertainty is higher for the hybrid model since it depends on a larger number of parameters as a consequence the gpd fitted to the annual pot rainfall data with bias corrected parameters is recommended for the estimation of design storms in engineering applications 5 2 comparison with previous studies on the distributions of seasonal rainfall extremes results of the seasonal analyses presented here are consistent with previous studies conducted in different regions kozubowski et al 2009 investigated whether daily annual rainfall records from north america follow an exponential distribution or a gpd with heavy tail and cavanaugh et al 2015 extended this analysis using a global dataset these authors found that i heavy tails are mostly found in regions and seasons where multiple types of synoptic systems occur and ii in areas dominated by a single type of weather event the distribution is mainly exponential the seasonal analyses of villarini 2012 and sk14 based on the gev distribution and the gpd respectively reached similar conclusions other studies focused instead on the utility of seasonal statistical models i e models where parameters vary with the season allamano et al 2011 showed that for models based on pot approaches disregarding the seasonality of rainfall extremes and using models where all data are pooled together may lead to significant underestimation of design values on the contrary they found that the role of seasonality is negligible for bm models rasmussen and rosbjerg 1991 compared seasonal and nonseasonal flood models based on nonclustered poissonian occurrence times and exponentially distributed exceedances using synthetic experiments where the strength of the seasonality was varied these authors showed that i simple nonseasonal models may be preferable when the seasonality is weak and ii data from the dominant seasons should be merged to apply a one seasonal model when the seasonality is pronounced overall previous studies support and provide physical explanations for the results found for central arizona the exponential distribution was demonstrated to be appropriate for modeling wintertime daily rainfall extremes which are mainly caused by a single type of synoptic pattern consisting of cold fronts driven by westerly flow from the pacific ocean in contrast the distribution of daily extremes was found to be heavy tailed during the summer monsoon season when multiple convective thunderstorms with short lifetime 1 h occur over one day the time scale here analyzed since these storms are originated by gulf surges of moisture associated with different synoptic patterns e g bordoni and stevens 2006 favors and abatzoglou 2013 the heavy tailed behavior could be caused by the superposition of diverse types of storms further investigations based on the examination of synoptic patterns derived from reanalysis products would be however needed to support this empirical evidence 5 3 utility for climate change studies projections of several climate models suggest that a warmer climate will impact occurrence and intensity of hydrologic extremes however the uncertainty of these projections is still significant especially at regional or local scales e g frei et al 2006 kao and ganguly 2011 piras et al 2016 the investigation of rainfall extremes at seasonal scale conducted here could be used as a diagnostic tool to assess the ability of climate models to capture the physical processes leading to extreme events under current climate conditions e g tripathi and dominguez 2013 as discussed in the previous section synoptic systems that are dominant in specific seasons can lead to distinct probability distributions of rainfall extremes whose characteristics e g the shape parameter should be reproduced by the climate models this is a critical step to test their skill to simulate extreme events under future warmer conditions and eventually reduce the uncertainty the use of a dense network of gauges and the study of the effect of location and orography on parameters of the gpd can support the development and refinement of downscaling tools aimed at increasing the utility of climate model outputs for example mamalakis et al 2017 have recently proposed a parametric approach based on the gpd to correct the bias and downscale in space the daily rainfall simulated by climate models this methodology has been tested in the mediterranean island of sardinia italy and demonstrated to be more accurate and less sensitive to the calibration period as compared to non parametric approaches that have been widely used in the past e g maurer and hidalgo 2008 maraun et al 2010 gudmundsson et al 2012 results found in central arizona can be utilized to further test the skill of this methodology in a new location and improve it by incorporating the relations between model parameters and local terrain features 6 conclusions the gpd was utilized to investigate the annual and seasonal distributions of daily rainfall extremes in central arizona as well as their spatial variability using a dense network of gauges recent methodological advancements were applied to assess the suitability of the gpd hypothesis improve the estimation of its parameters and limit the bias due to short sample sizes in this region it was found that the seasonal distributions of daily rainfall extremes are different in summer and winter seasons which are characterized by markedly different synoptic systems these distributions can be merged through a simple hybrid probability distribution to model the daily extremes at annual scale organized spatial patterns mainly controlled by elevation were observed for parameter α 0 controlling the mean of the distributions in contrast orography plays a negligible influence on the variability of parameter ξ controlling the shape of the upper tail finally in this region it was found that the design values estimated with pot models are similar to those provided by noaa14 based on bm approaches results of this work i increase the knowledge of daily extreme rainfall in the region and improve the modeling capability at higher spatial resolution ii provide tools to evaluate the ability of climate models to reproduce extreme events and iii support application and development of spatial downscaling routines the methodologies proposed are broadly applicable to other regions including urban areas where rainfall records of dense networks of gauges are becoming increasingly available acknowledgments the author thanks dr elena volpi and dr francesco serinaldi for their in depth reviews that helped to significantly improve the quality of paper stephen d waters from the flood control district of the maricopa county is also thanked for providing the rainfall data of the network prof roberto deidda is also thanked for his suggestions fcdmc data are also available at the website http www fcd maricopa gov 3847 flood control district and ncei data can be downloaded at https www ncdc noaa gov data access appendix a the method used to compute the field significance for the autocorrelation and mann kendall tests is based on bootstrap resampling and was adapted from guerreiro et al 2014 a total of 1000 samples were generated by sampling the rainfall records in the time period 1980 2013 each sample was created through an iterative procedure based on a random selection of days without replacement for each day the rainfall observations at all available stations were extracted in order to preserve the spatial correlation among the stations the random selection of days was repeated until the number of days with data for each station was at least equal to the sample size of the corresponding observed record once the sample was built the autocorrelation and mann kendall tests were applied at 5 significance level at each location and the percent of gauges where the test failed was recorded this resulted in 1000 values that were used to find the 95th percentile defining the critical value for assessing the test significance appendix b the mtm uses a hierarchal approach for estimating parameters of eq 3 consisting of the following steps i parameters α 0 ξ and ζ 0 of eq 3 are estimated for a range of thresholds u ii the median value of ξ across the thresholds is calculated and used to constrain a second estimate of α 0 and ζ 0 for the same range of thresholds u iii the median value of α 0 is then calculated and used to constrain a third estimate of ζ 0 and iv the median value of ζ 0 is finally computed the median values of ξ α 0 and ζ 0 calculated in steps ii iv are the final parameters appendix c the application of the technique proposed by deidda and puliga 2006 and here adopted to account for the application of goodness of fit test with discretized data involved the following steps the gpd was first fitted to the original data and used to randomly generate an ensemble of 1000 samples with the same size of the original record for each random sample the same rounding off rule of the original data in this case discretization at 1 mm resolution was applied the gpd was estimated in each sample and the metrics of the three goodness of fit tests were calculated this resulted in 1000 values for each metric that were used to calculate the acceptance regions of the tests at a significance level of 5 appendix d the monte carlo experiments designed to build the confidence intervals of the analytical equations between elevation and parameters of the gpd and exponential distribution eq 8 or linear regression consisted of the following steps for each gauge i a sample with the same size of the original record was randomly generated from the gpd or exponential distribution with bias corrected parameters and ii parameters were re estimated on the randomly generated sample the relations linking the parameters with z were fitted again on the re estimated parameter values of all gauges a total of 1000 experiments were conducted and the 90 confidence intervals of the relations were calculated appendix e the confidence intervals for the quantiles xt with t being the return period of the gpd and hybrid distributions were obtained through monte carlo experiments where i for each gauge 1000 samples with the same size of the original record were randomly generated from the gpd or hybrid distributions with bias corrected parameters ii parameters were re estimated on the randomly generated samples and the quantiles xt were calculated and iii the 5th and 95th quantiles were extracted from the empirical distribution of xt
