7075,glacier recession and formation of glacial lakes along with outburst flood hazards are increasing in response to changing climate in the himalayan region this study describes evolution of dalung and padam glaciers and their associated lakes employing multi temporal datasets of landsat mss tm etm indian remote sensing liss iii google earthtm aster gdem and survey of india topographic maps the dalung glacier dg and lake dl are present in suru river catchment whereas the padam glacier pg and lake pl are present in tsarap river catchment of zanskar basin western himalaya from 1962 to 2015 the dg and pg have shrunk at different rates the dg has shrunk by 2 6 0 56 km2 19 2 4 1 at a rate of 0 05 0 01 km2 a 1 whereas the pg has shrunk by 3 4 0 65 km2 12 7 2 4 at a rate of 0 06 0 01 km2 a 1 the frontal recession was recorded as 1 240 0 02 km 15 7 2 0 at a rate of 20 0 4 m a 1 for dg and 2 690 0 5 m 21 3 2 1 at a rate of 50 7 0 1 m a 1 for pg consequently the proglacial glacial lakes have formed indicating an expansion of 20 3 4 dl and 58 4 5 pl during 1990 2015 using integrated criteria of standard indices for the identification of potentially dangerous glacial lakes pdgls the lakes were found to be vulnerable and have a potential to cause breaching in the coming years in order to provide inputs for the emergency action plan one dimensional mike 11 model was used to generate the peak flood hydrographs at the lake and other vulnerable sites downstream highest peak discharge of 3361 7 m3 s 1 dl and 4210 3 m3 s 1 pl were estimated at the lake sites which has reduced to 1520 9 m3 s 1 and 1722 4 m3 s 1 respectively at the outlet sites the reduced discharge at downstream sites still bears the potential to create dangerous flood hazards keywords zanskar dalung padam glacier retreat glof mike 11 1 introduction the climate change has caused a continuous glacier recession and emergence of glacial lakes behind the newly exposed unstable moraines in most of the glaciated regions of the world zemp et al 2009 bolch et al 2012 like other regions the formation of glacial lakes in the himalayas in response to climate change is a new development and most of the lakes in this region have formed within the last five decades raj 2010 a majority of these lakes are behind loosely consolidated end moraine dams typically composed of poorly consolidated and inherently unstable glacial material until recent past a number of glacial lakes have been identified and found expanding owing to climate change and glacier thinning reynolds 2000 benn et al 2000 lohani 2015 mir et al 2017 jain and mir 2017 the moraines provide a physical barrier to glacial melt water drainage which ultimately leads to formation of moraine dammed glacial lakes costa and schuster 1988 with a potential to form a glacial lake outburst flood glof hazard westoby et al 2014 worni et al 2014 lohani 2015 normally two types of glacial lakes are recognized i proglacial lakes and ii supraglacial lakes the proglacial lakes often grow downstream of steep glaciers where water is collected behind former moraines richardson and reynolds 2000a komori 2008 due to the recession of glacier terminus frey et al 2010 westoby et al 2014 the supraglacial lakes develop on the surface of glacier itself and grow by coalescence of small ponds richardson and reynolds 2000a benn et al 2012 these glacial lakes have the capacity to impound large volumes of melt water in excess of 106 107 m3 following the continuous lake expansion sakai et al 2000 janský et al 2009 somos valenzuela et al 2014 due to the impounded huge volumes of water and unstable nature of moraine deposits such lakes have high tendency of breaching and therefore are expected to be hazardous in case of any breaching the resulting rapid discharge burst of massive amounts of water and debris is known as glacial lake outburst flood glof such a glof can be catastrophic in downstream areas in mountainous regions such as himalayas richardson and reynolds 2000a several major glofs in the asian territory have been previously reported and studied in detail which include the luggye tsho in bhutan himalaya watanabe and rothacher 1996 tam pokhari in mt everest region osti and egashira 2009 and lake zyndan in tien shan narama et al 2009 further past studies covering more lake outbursts also include bajracharya et al 2007 narama et al 2009 hewitt and liu 2010 jain et al 2010 chen et al 2010 icimod 2011 jain et al 2015a lohani 2015 2016 lohani et al 2015 jain et al 2015b lohani and jain 2016 and aggarwal et al 2013 thus the risks to human life and property located downstream of potentially hazardous glacial lakes pdgls of the himalayan region have augmented due to frequent glacier recession and glof events reported during past several decades at least 14 glof events have been reported in nepal icimod 2011 30 in the tibet autonomous region tar in china liu et al 2013 and 21 in bhutan komori et al 2012 and 5 in the hunza basin pakistan ashraf et al 2012 previous studies have revealed an occurrence of glof about 450 years ago along the seti khola ives 2010 the first glof event in the indian himalaya has been reported in 1926 from the shyok glacier jammu and kashmir which has caused tremendous destruction of abudan village and the surrounding land covering a distance of 400 km from the outburst source mason 1929 an outburst of landslide dammed lake at parechu river china during june 2005 caused a transboundary flood in himachal pradesh india chorabari lake in kedarnath india was a very disastrous recent event in the year 2013 jain et al 2013 in the hindu kush himalayan hkr region 8000 glacial lakes and 209 pdgls 26 in nepal ives et al 2010 24 in bhutan kattelmann 2003 30 in india bajracharya et al 2007 52 in pakistan ashraf et al 2012 and 77 in china bajracharya et al 2007 have been reported similarly in an attempt worni et al 2013 have provided an inventory of 103 glacial lakes for indian himalayan region in which three potentially hazardous lakes have been studied in detail in response to recent climate warming scenario the glacial lakes have greatly expanded in the hkh region gardelle et al 2011 zhang et al 2015 overall the lake area is reported to have increased at an average rate of 0 8 1 0 a 1 in the himalayas qinghai tibetan plateau in china and tian shan mountains wang et al 2012a b zhang et al 2015 in the eastern and middle himalayas the lake area has increased by 20 60 and 17 contrary to expansion it is also reported that the lake area has declined by 30 50 in the karakoram and hindu kush mountains in general the rapid expansion or formation of lakes as a result of ice melt at the margins of receding glaciers in response to climate change potentially increase the possibility of glofs barros et al 2014 field et al 2012 considering the above facts the glacial lakes particularly the pdgls should be monitored regularly so as to process mitigation measures well in time and to warn people before any serious upcoming hazard however this is difficult cumbersome and time consuming employing conventional methods owing to inaccessibility and harsh weather conditions prevailing at high altitude himalayan regions instead the modern techniques of geographic information system gis and remote sensing are highly suitable which enable rapid analysis of large areas and number in an inexpensive and economical act huggel et al 2002b kääb et al 2005 these techniques are more specific and advantageous to identify vulnerable lakes in a particular region and help carry out detailed studies like glof modeling and risk assessment in order to discover any potential risk to down lake communities or infrastructure bajracharya et al 2007 mergili and schneider 2011 worni et al 2012 it is pertinent to mention that the modeling of glofs is usually similar to the dam break study of the moraine dams jain et al 2012 2015b generally the scaled physical hydraulic models or mathematical simulation models are frequently used for the dam break flood simulation studies wecs 1987 carrivick 2006 bajracharya et al 2007 the zanskar basin a part of western indian himalayan or hkh region is highly glaciated with about 697 glaciers sangewar and shukhla 2009 the glaciers have exhibited dominantly a retreating trend despite advancing nature of certain glaciers during recent past nathawat et al 2008 kamp et al 2011 pandey et al 2011 ghosh et al 2014 mir and majeed 2016 like other regions the glacier recession has resulted in the formation and expansion of glacial lakes in this area as well in this area indications of earlier flash floods or glofs far upstream have been reported in the ladakh mountain range running parallel to the zanskar mountain range gergan et al 2009 but till date a complete inventory of glacier lakes indicating the number of pdgls and their detailed study on risk assessment and glof simulations are unavailable in this area except a brief few studies for example worni et al 2013 recently carried out the mapping and classification of few glacial lakes in terms of glof in this basin as a part of glacial lake inventory for the whole indian himalaya additionally raj 2010 has studied a lake for glof assessment in the zanskar basin using remote sensing and empirical equations in the present study two benchmark glaciers and lakes present in the zanskar basin were selected for a detailed temporal evolution study using satellite data an assessment of the glof hazards to the downstream areas from selected lakes has also been attempted the one dimensional mike 11 model was used for glof modeling in this study 2 the study area the present study areas dalung and padam glaciers lakes are a part of zanskar basin western himalaya fig 1 the elevation of the zanskar basin varies from 3070 to 6400 m a s l with a mean elevation of 4735 m a s l the zanskar basin is situated between the greater himalayan range ghr and ladakh mountain ranges and holds a multiple glacial records mitchell et al 1999 the area is drained by two major rivers such as the suru river flowing towards northwest direction and stod river flowing towards southeast direction the suru and stod rivers take opposite flowing directions at pensi la 4030 m a s l the pensi la pensi pass is called the gateway to zanskar and also acts as a water divide for the suru and stod rivers the glaciers having various dimensions are mainly concentrated on the northern aspect in the valley however due to the snow accumulation on the glaciers by the influence of south asian summer monsoon mostly valley glaciers and tongue glaciers are formed in the zanskar mountain range kamp et al 2011 one notable feature of the glaciers in the zanskar basin is that a significant number of clean glaciers are present with lesser amount of debris cover in addition to glaciers having ablation areas covered heavily with debris the zanskar basin hosts several famous glaciers such as durung drung parkachik pensilungpa haskira kange and hagshu besides other large number of glaciers it is important to note that the names of the glaciers are normally mentioned and adopted according to the survey of india topographic soi maps but these maps didn t mention any name for the padam glacier selected for the present study therefore the name padam is adopted for the glacier based on its nearest major locality that is padam town another reason for the selection of name padam is that the flood hazard has been routed up to padam town from the lake in this area padam town is the major and only administrative tehsil of kargil district jammu and kashmir india but sac 2016 has named the padam glacier as katkar glacier in its report probably due to a small katkar nala that emerges from the glacier accordingly based on the mother glaciers name the lakes are also assigned the proper names hereafter the selected glaciers and lakes will be designated as dg dalung glacier dl dalung lake pg padam glacier and pl padam lake the geographical coordinates of dl are as n33 56 22 e76 13 43 and those of pl are as n33 09 27 e76 59 05 the dg is having a total catchment area of about 39 km2 flows from the peaks of the greater himalaya located towards northwest of pensi la it contributes to the suru river which flows in northwest direction the pg is located in the tsarap sub basin of zanskar basin which flows towards the north east and joins the river stod at padam town from the pg a small tributary stream called as katkar nala emerges and joins with another glacier fed small stream reru phu near sumdo the katkar and reru phu streams run over a small distance from the source glaciers before their final confluence with the main tsarap river of the basin in other words the katkar forms a small sub tributary catchment of the main tsarap river catchment the river stod is also known as the doda which flows south east from pensi la towards padam and merges with the river tsarap to create the zanskar river the pg has a catchment area of about 118 km2 the snout altitude of dg and pg for the year 2015 is 4031 m and 3942 m a s l respectively overall the equilibrium line altitude ela for the glaciers in this region with a northwest northeast orientation is between 5200 m and 5400 m a s l burbank and fort 1985 the accumulation of snow mass accumulation on these glaciers occurs through direct snowfall blowing snow and avalanche the zanskar mountain range is a high altitude semi desert lying on the northern flank of the ghr the ghr acts as a climatic barrier preventing the area from most of the monsoons and develops a rain shadow zone the area receives most of the snowfall during winter season because of the western disturbances and rainfall during the summer season while the mean annual precipitation in zanskar region is reported about 250 mm the weather at leh station 3506 m a s l which is close to the zanskar basin records a mean annual precipitation of about 93 mm klimes 2003 archer and fowler 2004 the pattern of precipitation changes from southeast to northwest of the region as the northwestern part is in proximity to the pensi la pass en route to an air mass link to pamirs the snowfall ranges between 2 05 and 6 84 mm at padam and 7 25 12 mm in the durung drung glacier valley raina and koul 2011 however the precipitation in this region occasionally occurs as rain at lower elevations the mean annual maximum and minimum temperature varies from 23 7 c august and 15 6 c january at leh station singh 1998 as reported the mean maximum temperature at the durung drung glacier in zanskar valley varies from 18 23 to 7 96 c during the summer season whereas the mean minimum temperature ranges between 1 32 and 7 8 c shukla and qadir 2016 in this region the wide range of fluctuations in winter temperature is primarily caused by western disturbances of winter season october april raina and koul 2011 this is probably due to the increasing northward aridity in this region having valley glaciers that are mainly restricted to the ghr and zanskar ranges however in the northern ladakh and karakoram ranges the cirque glaciers are commonly found and valley glaciers are rarely formed kamp et al 2011 3 data used in this study the soi topographic maps 1 50 000 satellite data of landsat series i e mss etm tm from national aeronautics space agency distributed through university of maryland s global land cover facility glcf http earthexplorer usgs gov and irs p6 liss iii linear imaging self scanning from national remote sensing centre nrsc hyderabad datasets have been used for the year 2015 the high resolution virtual google earthtm images hereafter as gei were used as the recent source of information the details of the data used are given in table 1 the prerequisite requirement of the available datasets for the identification and delineation of glaciers and glacial lakes is that the data images must be snow free and cloud free or with minimum snow cover and cloud cover so that these features can be visible for the himalayan region this kind of data is generally available during september to november months of the year thus the choice of data is limited to these three months furthermore available data must be free from anomalies due to defective or inefficient sensors the soi topographic maps provide essential old detailed topographic information and therefore these maps were used as the base map for glacier and lake evolution studies however there are several studies which have reported problems of glacial extent demarcation on the soi maps e g bhambri and bolch 2009 mir et al 2017 but in this study we have observed that the glacial extent demarcation on soi maps of 1962 matched well with the landsat image of 1975 except near the glaciers tongues where the temporal changes are obvious the landsat series of satellites provided longest continuous record of satellite based observations and are available at no cost for the public use the landsat is an important resource for monitoring glacier recession and glacial lake expansion and is also a main source of medium spatial resolution earth observations used in decision making woodcock et al 2008 chander et al 2009 the liss iii images were used to assist the mapping of pg pl on landsat etm scene of 2005 because this image has data gaps due to the scan line error produced by the slc scan line corrector failure since early summer 2003 aster dem was used to generate the spatial information like catchment area elevation slope contour co ordinates of points etc aster is an imaging instrument that is flying on the terra satellite launched in december 1999 as a part of nasa s earth observing system eos and produces 30 m resolution elevation data previously the gdem has been used successfully for hydrodynamic modeling in the himalayan region e g sharma et al 2009 jain et al 2012 agarwal et al 2013 therefore this study also involves the use of aster gdem to create the input layers such as stream centerline cross sections and elevation values of it for simulation in one dimensional mike11 hd model 4 methodology for glacier and lake mapping for each phase of mapping multiple images were used to ensure the reliable delineation of glacier and lake boundaries initially the soi maps were scanned and georeferenced using the gis platform the soi maps were used for the co registration of all the satellites images based on about more than 100 ground control points evenly distributed within the whole basin the root mean square error rmse for mss scene was found to be 35 m 0 53 whereas for tm etm scenes it was 15 m 0 5 respectively the liss iii images were orthorectified based on the aster dem before co registration to soi maps and showed a registration error of 20 m 0 67 furthermore the images were geometrically rectified to the same projection system of wgs 84 utm zone 43 overall the rmses obtained were considered accurate for the study from the soi maps the glaciers were directly delineated by manual digitization in gis platform similarly using the landsat mss scene a false color composite fcc consisting bands of 432 rgb was used for the direct manual digitization of the glaciers and lakes the accuracy of manual digitization was controlled within one pixel however it is important to mention that the lakes were not clearly demarcated on soi maps surveyed year 1962 therefore the appearance of these lakes was assumed to be after the year 1962 for the recent year 2015 the glacier and lake extents were delineated from gei directly by on screen digitization that are created as vector data files in kml or kmz format these vector data files were then converted to shp files in arcgis software 10 2 using the tm and etm images the glaciers were first automatically delimited using band ratios of near infrared and shortwave infrared channels i e tm4 tm5 of the images paul et al 2009 because these glaciers are clean type or debris free this approach revealed high reflectance over ice and snow whereas low reflectance over the other terrain similarly for the delineation of glacial lakes a semi automated mapping with a normalized difference water index ndwi was applied using the blue and near infrared channels which express maximum and minimum reflectance differences for glacial water and give good discrimination from ice and snow huggel et al 2002a jain et al 2012 however it is important to note that the effect of shadows on glacier and lake mapping was insignificant in this area and therefore considered negligible still through close visual inspection the misclassified glacier areas if any such as water bodies shadows and isolated rocks were eliminated during post processing i e manual exclusion inclusion of wrongly classified missing areas additionally the aster gdem was used for better visualization and extraction of ice divides and glacier extents wherever possible visual inspection of the glacier lakes and other associated glacial features on gei was highly ensured and any mismatch found was eliminated manually mir et al 2017 the accuracy of manual digitization was controlled within a half pixel after mapping the glacier lake area glacier average length glacier terminus elevation median elevation elevation of snow line altitude equilibrium line altitude sla ela glacier slope orientation and other attribute information was determined in gis platform the mean slope data of both the glaciers was estimated as an average value of all pixels falling in its respective classes intersected by the glacier outlines the mean aspect was estimated by dividing the mean sine by the mean cosine of aspect across all cells guo et al 2015 mir et al 2017 the average mid altitude was derived as the arithmetic mean of all glacier pixel altitudes whereas the median elevation was extracted as the 50th percentile of the cumulative number distribution of pixel elevations as suggested by guo et al 2015 the glacier length was derived manually in this study first a central flow line from the snout to the highest point in the accumulation zone along the maximum length of the glaciers was selected then a band of stripes with a distance of 50 m between each stripe was drawn parallel to the main central flow line of the glaciers the average length of the glacier was then calculated from the intersection of the stripes with the glacier outlines in terms of its retreat for comparison with average length change mir and majeed 2016 mir et al 2017 the termini snout of glaciers were determined through visual interpretation technique based on shape size pattern tone texture and association in satellite images mir et al 2017 in addition the contour maps generated from gdem were also used for locating and determining the altitude of the glacier snouts glacier retreat was measured along the centerline using snout positions delineated on the different satellite datasets the snowline equilibrium line was delineated using standard color combinations of bands rgb such as band 2 band 3 and band 5 of landsat datasets and their visual interpretations østrem 1975 using the proxy that at the end of the melt season the snow line altitude sla remains approximately coincident with equilibrium line altitude ela in the temperate glaciers due to the insignificant extent of superimposed ice zone paterson 1998 rabatel et al 2012 the temporal and spatial changes in slas are an indicator of elas and subsequent changes in glacier mass balance guo et al 2014 the ela discriminates the ablation and accumulation zones of the glacier the utility of remote sensing based sla estimation as a proxy to ascertain the mass variation in glaciers has recently gained popularity in view of their difficult access and dearth of field data mcfadden et al 2011 guo et al 2014 wu et al 2014 mir et al 2014a though less accurate than glaciological methods racoviteanu et al 2008 hanshaw and bookhagen 2014 these proxies are reliable enough to reflect the status of glaciers health pesu 2007 pellika and rees 2009 however it is important to note that the inaccuracy in sla s estimation may be caused by the non optimal date of the satellite data image taken before the timing of maximum ablation or inaccuracies in the classification itself pellikka 2007 the aster dem data were also used for semi automatic delineation of drainage basins watersheds of each glacier lakes and extraction of topographic parameters using archydro tools in arcgis software the river cross section details elevation information at a regular interval of 1 km downstream from both the lakes were also obtained from the dem because of the unavailability of field based details of the river cross sections fig 2 a b the cross sections were created at a closer interval essentially at some critical locations where significant topographical variations existed also a buffer zone of 1 km was created along the river stretch for simulations arcgis software was used to delineate cross sections of the streams originating from dl and pl respectively for this purpose vector layers of the streams and the buffer lines along the streams on both sides of it at a distance of 1 5 km were created the vector layers of river cross sections were overlaid on the dem of the basin using erdas imagine software fig 2a b the spatial profile viewer in erdas was used to create a height cross section profile along a route as it allows to visualize the reflectance spectrum of a poly line of data file values in a single band of data one dimensional mode or in many bands perspective three dimensional mode and helps in interpretation of changes in elevation along a planned route and in identifying the sections of the route which are particularly steep or flat after this along each cross section line of the streams about 100 points were created in arcgis the corresponding elevation values of all these points along each cross section were extracted in gis platform 4 1 uncertainty assessment of glacier and glacial lake mapping the glacier and lake outlines derived from satellite datasets at various spatial and temporal resolutions are subjected to various degrees of uncertainty paul et al 2013 jain and mir 2017 for instance the positional accuracy of the glaciers snout is influenced by the sensor resolution williams et al 1997 and co registration error hall et al 2003 similarly the accuracy of the glacier outlines is influenced by the debris cover on the glaciers paul et al 2013 therefore the quantification of error is crucial to ascertain the accuracy and significance of the results the most accurate way to assess glacier outline errors would be to use high resolution images paul et al 2013 but such a data were not available for our study region still wherever possible the higher resolution images from virtual ge were inspected in conjunction with the landsat images to maintain the accuracy in this study mainly the errors of co registration and glacier lake boundary delineations were considered that might have resulted in different levels of accuracy this is because most of the utilized scenes of landsat series have similar resolutions except liss iii and mss scenes and the glaciers are debris free the linear terminus change uncertainty u was estimated by using the remote sensing uncertainty evaluation formula ye et al 2006 mir et al 2014b 2017 as u a 2 b 2 σ where a and b are the resolutions of images a and b respectively and σ is the registration error of each image to the base image which in this case were the soi maps overall the terminus accuracy was estimated to be 88 11 m for mss image 50 92 m for tm etm images 47 68 m for etm image 43 73 m for liss iii image and 17 16 m for ge images the measurement of uncertainty of glacier area uarea for both the glaciers was obtained by using the following formula ye et al 2006 mir et al 2014b as uarea 2 uv where u is the terminus uncertainty and v is the image pixel resolution the uncertainty a combination of mapping uncertainty and the uncertainty of the misregistration in the area extent of the glaciers was estimated to be 0 01 km2 1 using mss 0 003 km2 0 3 for tm etm image of similar resolutions 0 0025 km2 0 25 for etm image 0 002 km2 0 2 for liss iii image and 0 0001 km2 0 01 for ge images respectively furthermore the uncertainty was also evaluated by comparing the glacier outlines derived from the landsat tm etm 27 m of 2005 and those derived from of irs liss iii image 23 5 m of the same year as suggested by paul et al 2013 the resultant uncertainty was found to be 0 6 in case of soi maps the uncertainty of 0 02 km2 2 was estimated by calculating the area of a buffer around glaciers having a width equal to the digitizing errors rmsr 10 m granshaw and fountain 2006 mir et al 2017 the overall uncertainty values estimated are well within or below the previously reported acceptable ranges racoviteanu et al 2008 bolch et al 2010 mir et al 2014a 2017 for accuracy assessment of glacial lake extents the accuracy of manual digitization using the landsat and liss iii datasets was controlled within quarter pixel 7 m the digitization error of 7 m used as buffer increment resulted in an accuracy of 3 for ge images the accuracy was checked by repeating the digitization of lakes three times by three experts which resulted in an accuracy of approximately 1 the area change uncertainty of the glaciers and its associated lakes for various data scenes for all the time intervals was estimated according to the law of error propagation using a given formula as θ change θ period 1 2 θ period 2 2 where θ period 1 and θ period 2 represent the uncertainties of the glacier outlines in period 1 and period 2 respectively 5 identifying potentially dangerous glacial lakes a substantial number of studies have reported many indices and several criteria e g type of lake and its volume rate of lake formation and growth position of lake dam condition conditions of associated mother glacier activity of supraglacial lakes reaction of glacier to climate change activity of glacier morphometric characteristics of glacier physical conditions of surrounding area presence of dead ice in end moraines situation down valley etc for the identification of pdgls richardson and reynolds 2000a b clague and evans 2000 campbell 2005 mckillop and clague 2007 xin et al 2008 bolch et al 2008a 2011 icimod 2011 mergili and schneider 2011 wang et al 2013 2012a b fujita et al 2013 however uncertainties remain with respect to the choice of most effective criteria with which to objectively evaluate glof probability fujita et al 2013 the detailed field investigations are essential and may be carried out to have a better understanding of above mentioned parameters of glacial lakes but field investigations are generally very difficult and time consuming due to inaccessible mountainous terrain with harsh weather conditions and large involved logistics huggel et al 2003 kääb et al 2005 quincey et al 2005 bolch et al 2011 icimod 2011 mir et al 2014a b therefore remote sensing techniques have proved to be the efficient tools and have been frequently applied for the identification of pdgls during recent decades e g wang et al 2012a b jain et al 2015a kapitsa et al 2017 in this study also the identification of pdgls was attempted with limited but important information acquired through remote sensing techniques for the characterization of the selected glacial lakes i e dl and pl as pdgls the indices and integrated criteria adopted are given in table 2 the criteria were derived from landsat images high resolution gei and aster gdem these indices of the criteria are ordered following che et al 2014 who based on literature review calculated the weightage of frequent application of the indices and then concluded that the frequently used indices as more important criterion in terms of glof assessment for the evaluation of glof hazard a typical trigger event is also essentially required there are a number of causes and mechanisms of triggering glof events fig 3 generally the different triggering mechanisms of glof depend on the position of the lake nature and position of the associated mother glaciers volume of water in the lakes nature of the damming materials physical and topographical conditions and other physical conditions of the surroundings moreover an interaction between the processes linked to these factors may strongly increase the vulnerability of the glacial lakes to glof hazard the pdgls may burst due to triggering by dam failures induced due to area expansion rate of lake up glacier and down valley expansion rate dead ice melting seepage degradation of permafrost seismic activity a flood wave caused due to rock snow or ice avalanche into the lake and abrupt rise in water level due to heavy precipitation consequently a sudden release of huge reserve of water and debris may occur to cause the glof watanabe et al 2009 bolch et al 2011 6 hydrodynamic modeling of glofs keeping in view the recent glof events in the himalayan basins and for planning the water resources projects in the region it is important to design flood and glofs therefore the identification of pdgls in the upstream catchments and glof modeling is very imperative for planning and designing of the water resources projects considering this the present study has been taken up as it provides a methodology for glof modeling useful for the upcoming hydro power projects the mike11 1d hydrodynamic model methodology was adopted for glof modeling mike11 is a professional engineering software package developed by dhi water and environment in 1987 and is used for simulation of one dimensional flow in estuaries rivers irrigation systems channels and other water bodies the software has been successfully used for glof modeling in himalayan basins by various researchers e g jain et al 2012 aggarwal et al 2013 lohani 2015 2016 lohani and jain 2016 thakur et al 2016 in processing it is very user friendly and dynamic modeling tool for the detailed design management and operation of both simple as well as complex channel systems mike11 user manual 2003 the essence of dam break modeling is hydrodynamic modeling which involves finding solutions of two partial differential equations originally derived by barre de saint venant in 1871 sleigh and goodwill 2000 the st venant equations cannot be solved explicitly except by making some assumptions which are unrealistic for most situations therefore numerical techniques have to be used three groups of methods are usually used finite difference finite elements and finite volumes sleigh and goodwill 2000 it is one of the models which use the above methods using finite difference method to compute the water level and discharge values for the cross sections along the river abbott and basco 1989 thakur et al 2016 the river channel is feed as a stream centerline with a buffer zone of 1 km along the river stretch and by a series of cross section profiles at regular intervals created from dems fig 2a b in the model the lakes are represented as dam break structures such as reservoirs with certain crest level and crest length the representation of lakes as a reservoir is achieved by its elevation surface area relation at chainage 0 km of the reservoir branch table 3 the resultant outburst flood peak flow is directly related to lake volume dam height and width dam material composition failure mechanism downstream topography and sediment availability it is notable that the glofs increase to peak flow then gradually or abruptly decrease to normal levels once the water source is exhausted in order to get the maximum glof peak at any location the breaching of moraine dam of lake has to be considered along with channel routing the model assesses the flood hydrograph of discharge from the dam breach and water level discharge time series at different locations of the river downstream of the dam due to propagation of flood waves however it is notable that the difference between the computed discharge and measured discharge can be minimized by modifying the dem derived cross sections and adjusting the values of manning n ramesh et al 2000 the aster dem used in this study has a pre production accuracy of 7 14 m at 95 confidence for vertical data and 30 m at 95 confidence for horizontal data therefore the derived cross section profiles and its width were modified after ge images and applying correction factors as well as taking theoretical water depth river profile as a function of river discharge from the literature julien 2002 cushman roisin 2014 further due to the low spatial resolution 30 m of the dem the generated river network cross sections and banks in few of the upstream cross sections were covered within a single pixel value with same elevation thus the validation of the input layers was first carried out against virtual ge images because of the non availability of field data errors wherever found were edited and corrected in gis platform to further minimize the errors in cross section extraction correction factors were applied after comparing the dem extracted cross sections with the available ground truth data for other places the layers were also edited to adjust for minimum bed elevation wherever downstream cross section elevation was found to be more than upstream elevation this editing was done because most of the dems do not contain full bathymetry information past studies have used the aster gdem successfully in generating the river centerlines cross sections etc with tolerable errors in the himalayan region wang et al 2012a jain et al 2012 thakur et al 2016 the manning s n was adopted from thakur et al 2016 thakur et al 2016 have derived the manning s n according to lulc land use land cover in nearby dhauliganga basin garhwal himalaya subsequently the adjusted cross sections were used in mike11 hd model for the simulation of the river flow at different sections to attain conveyance factor the simulation of dam breach required several input parameters which are classified as 1 lake information i e volume area and depth 2 cross sections from lake to the outlet of the basin these are used to model the channel s topography and routing 3 the dam breach parameters i e initial and final breach width and level time duration of breach development and breach invert level time of failure etc the details of the input parameters for the simulation are given in the table 4 further as the glof modeling carried out in this study is not being performed on the measured flood discharge data to compare the results of the simulations with or calibrate the model therefore the error analysis is not performed but there are several previous studies that have reported a higher accuracy and acceptable application of the model in the himalayas e g jain et al 2012 aggarwal et al 2013 thakur et al 2016 in a recent study thakur et al 2016 based on linear regression 0 954 and nash coefficients 0 94 have reported more than 94 of validation between the observed and simulated water discharge data at joshimath site in a nearby dhauliganga basin located in the western himalayas 7 results and discussion in this study the changes in glaciers and associated lakes were analyzed for different time periods between 1962 and 1975 1976 1990 1991 2000 2001 2005 2006 2009 and 2010 2015 depending upon the availability of the satellite datasets it is notable that the pg and pl are clearly visible on the images of 1989 and 2010 whereas the dg and dl are not clearly visible on these images due to presence of snow cover particularly towards the northern areas therefore the images of 1989 and 2010 were used for the delineation of pg and pl whereas the images of 1990 and 2009 were used for the delineation of dg and dl due to the clear visibility for this time but in order to maintain the consistency in results and to undergo systematic comparative analysis of glacier and lake evolution the 1990 and 2009 years were considered representative and standard years therefore the data derived during 1989 and 2010 for the pg and pl were also represented in terms of the considered standard years this is because the smaller changes if any during a small period of time of one year from 1989 to 1990 and 2009 2010 were supposed to be very insignificant the detailed characteristics of these glaciers are given in table 5 7 1 glacier retreat area and sla changes monitoring changes in the terminal positions of the two selected glaciers for a total time period of 53 years 1962 2015 in the study area shows that the glaciers dg and pg have receded continuously and rapidly fig 4 a b for instance during 1962 the snout of the dg was at an elevation of 4362 m a s l and has retreated to an elevation of 4471 m a s l as observed during 2015 similarly the pg s snout was observed at an elevation of 4479 m a s l which has retreated to an elevation of 4536 m a s l since the snout retreat has a direct bearing on the length of the glaciers an analysis of the length changes was also carried out the length of dg was 7 93 0 74 km during 1962 and has decreased gradually to 6 77 0 11 km during 2015 overall the total retreat of 1240 140 m 15 7 0 17 from 1962 to 2015 at a rate of 23 3 2 6 m a 1 was found for dg fig 5 a previously kamp et al 2011 based on soi maps and satellite data have reported a retreat of 745 m at a rate of 26 6 m a 1 for this glacier between the years from 1975 to 2003 which is in agreement to our results likely the length of pg was observed to be 12 6 1 11 km during 1962 which has gradually decreased to 9 91 0 17 km 2015 for this glacier the total retreat observed was 2690 650 m 21 3 2 44 from 1962 to 2015 at a rate of 50 7 12 2 m a 1 fig 5b for this glacier raj 2010 has studied the retreat from 1975 to 2005 and reported an average retreat rate of 12 m a 1 considering a similar time period from 1975 to 2005 in the present study the total retreat was determined to be 830 230 m at a rate of 27 6 6 4 m a 1 which is two times higher than a retreat of 12 m a 1 this difference in the recession rate was attributed to the variable methodologies adopted in these two studies for example in the present study the average length was calculated from the intersection of stripes with the glacier outlines in terms of its retreat whereas the glacier retreat measurements have been carried out along the maximum length of the glacier in case of raj 2010 however the present observed retreat rates i e 23 3 2 6 and 50 7 12 2 m a 1 fall within the range of the glacier retreat rates of 0 88 m a 1 reported from 1975 1989 1992 to 2001 in this area pandey et al 2011 similarly kamp et al 2011 have also reported recession rates varying between 0 6 and 60 9 m a 1 studied from 1975 to 2003 2006 for selected ten large glaciers of same basin following the continuous recession of the glaciers the area has also decreased considerably from 1962 to 2015 the dg s area was 13 7 0 56 km2 during 1962 which has decreased to 11 0 0 04 km2 2015 overall the dg has shrunk by 2 6 0 56 km2 19 2 4 1 at a rate of 0 05 0 01 km2 a 1 during the last 53 years period fig 5a similarly the area of pg has decreased considerably from 26 7 0 65 km2 during 1962 to 23 3 0 04 km2 during 2015 the pg has decreased by 3 4 0 65 km2 21 7 2 4 from 1962 to 2015 at a rate of 0 06 0 004 km2 a 1 fig 5b overall the dg and pg revealed a higher and continuous trend in glacier retreat and areal loss from 1962 to 2015 with a slight decline after 2005 during the time from 1962 1975 to 2000 the glaciers exhibited higher loss these results are more or less comparable to earlier studies in this area and elsewhere which suggest that the decade after 1990s experienced greater glacier wastage and retreat bolch et al 2008a b ren et al 2006 pandey et al 2011 the higher glacier loss during 1990s may be linked to a relative increase in annual mean temperature ren et al 2006 moreover a comparison of changes between these two selected glaciers revealed a heterogeneous pattern of retreat and areal loss for instance the dg showed a retreat rate of 23 3 2 6 m a 1 15 7 0 17 which is relatively small than a retreat rate of 50 7 12 2 m a 1 21 3 2 44 of pg table 6 the heterogeneous pattern of glacier shrinkage and retreat shown by these glaciers dg and pg is attributed to the difference in aspect altitude local climate and other topographic factors as these glaciers are located in widely separated sub basins of the zanskar basin as a result of continuous retreat of these glaciers proglacial lakes have developed at the termini of them therefore the higher retreat of these two glaciers may be attributed to the presence of these moraine dammed proglacial lakes particularly the higher retreat rate of the pg can be attributed to the presence of its moraine dammed lake and relatively steep gradient of its mother glacier s tongue in the zanskar sub basin previous studies have reported an average rate of retreat of 20 m a 1 mostly for the glaciers without proglacial lakes kamp et al 2011 kulkarni et al 2011 the average retreat rate of 20 m a 1 is comparatively lower than the retreat results of the present glaciers in addition the higher area loss of 19 24 4 1 and lower retreat of 15 7 0 17 23 3 2 6 m a 1 of dg as compared to the lower area loss of 12 71 2 4 and higher retreat of 21 3 2 44 50 7 12 2 m a 1 of pg is probably due to the variable topographic configuration and length width ratio of the glaciers which controls the area and length changes mir et al 2017 for example the greater width of the frontal part of the dg terminus yields a higher areal loss with lower terminus recession the change in length also depends on various factors such as bed slope and length of the glacier and its response time etc it is commonly seen that the flat bedded glaciers e g dg show large area change due to vertical thinning with marginal frontal recession conversely steep slope at the glacier front will lead to excessive frontal recession e g pg the higher and heterogeneous pattern of glacier shrinkage and retreat shown by these glaciers dg and pg is in the line of past studies carried out in this area for example nathawat et al 2008 reported that glaciers have lost 18 of area and retreated by 6 33 m a 1 from 1962 to 2001 in parts of the zanskar valley a recent study on five large glaciers of the zanskar basin reported an area loss of 13 15 at a retreat rate of 8 19 m a 1 of clean glaciers and 14 21 of area loss at a retreat rate of 2 3 m a 1 of debris covered glaciers shukla and qadir 2016 similarly pandey et al 2011 reported a heterogeneous pattern of glacier shrinkage in this area for example they reported a glacier area loss of 1 5 and a retreat of 3 42 m a 1 from 1975 to 1989 1992 followed by an area loss of 4 and a glacier retreat of 0 88 m a 1 from 1989 1992 to 2001 they further reported that the change in glacier area was 3 for 23 glaciers and 2 for 7 glaciers and the glacier retreat was 0 80 m a 1 from 2001 to 2007 rai et al 2013 have reported a glacier area loss of 19 9 1 85 km2 a 1 from 1962 to 2001 in the doda valley of zanskar basin in contrast kulkarni et al 2011 have reported an area loss of 9 2 2 41 km2 a 1 from 1962 to 2001 in the zanskar basin similarly schmidt and nüsser 2009 have reported an area loss of 13 3 0 34 km2 a 1 from 1969 to 2010 in the kang yatze massif zanskar basin kamp et al 2011 also reported a general trend of glacier recession from 1975 to 2008 in the zanskar himalaya mir and majeed 2016 have reported a small retreat and areal loss of parkachik glacier located in close proximity to dg in the suru sub basin of this area they reported a total retreat of 127 0 09 m at a rate of 2 9 0 004 m a 1 and an area loss of 740 0 7 m2 1 5 0 09 at a rate of 74 0 7 m2 a 1 of the parkachik glacier from 1971 to 2015 thus from the above discussion it is clear that the glaciers in the zanskar basin are retreating and losing area at heterogeneous rates which probably depends upon the aspects altitude hypsometry the characteristics and thickness of supraglacial debris cover on the glacier surface characteristics of supraglacial and proglacial lakes topographic configuration and length width ratio of glacier tongue ablation zone the local climatic system the glacier size and accumulation area ratio etc as reported by previous studies the continuous recession of the zanskar basin glaciers is most likely caused by the combined effect of warmer temperatures and reduced precipitation ren et al 2006 kamp et al 2011 shukla and qadir 2016 mir and majeed 2016 in a recent study in this region it has been reported that the climate is warming and precipitation is reducing from the last few decades chevuturi et al 2016 this observation is also supported by analyzing the changes in the sla ela in this study ohmura et al 1992 lie et al 2003 shukla and qadir 2016 for example an analysis of the mean sla ela of the dg revealed that it has risen from 4807 m a s l 1975 to 5080 m a s l 2015 as shown in fig 5c the sla ela estimation for the dg was carried out for 1975 1990 2000 2005 2009 and 2015 years similarly the sla ela of the pg monitored for 1975 1990 2000 and 2015 years have gone up from 4920 m a s l 1976 to 5210 m a s l 2015 the results reveal that the present glaciers have experienced a steady increase in sla ela values from 1975 to 2000 but little variability from 2000 to 2015 however an overall increasing trend of sla ela is evident fig 5c further between the dg and pg the specific sla ela values are generally increasing but the temporal variability differs likely due to several environmental factors such as local temperature precipitation hypsometry humidity and differential shading mcfadden et al 2011 guo et al 2014 thus it appears that a general rise in sla ela may be attributed to regional climatic warming while individual sla ela variation may be related to the topographic factors these results are similar to a recent study carried out by shukla and qadir 2016 who have reported an overall increasing trend of sla for certain selected glaciers of the same basin that is ascribed to the rise in temperature and decline in precipitation 7 2 lake formation and expansion appearance of glacial lakes on the himalayan glaciers is a recent development that is linked to the overall glacier recession and negative mass balance of glaciers kääb et al 2012 gardelle et al 2013 neckel et al 2014 however in this study the presence of proglacial lakes i e dl and pl associated with dg and pg before 1990 1975 is not well documented due to the non availability of the appropriate data and especially doubtful demarcation of lakes on the soi maps of 1962 but it can be inferred that due to the continuous and rapid glacier recession of the dg at a rate of 23 3 2 6 m a 1 from 1962 a proglacial lake has developed at its snout after then the area has continuously expanded during different time periods from 1990 to 2015 for instance the lake area was observed to be 0 20 0 004 km2 during 1990 which has increased gradually to 0 48 0 009 km2 in 2015 overall the area of dl has increased by 0 28 0 005 km2 140 10 from 1990 to 2015 at a rate 0 011 0 0002 km2 a 1 fig 5a 6a similarly after the formation of pl its area was observed to be 0 17 0 007 km2 in 1975 that has increased to 0 58 0 01 km2 in 2015 overall the area of pl has increased by 0 41 0 008 km2 241 1 17 from 1975 to 2015 at a rate 0 010 0 0003 km2 a 1 figs 5b 6b like heterogeneous loss of mother glaciers the expansion of its associated lakes also showed a heterogeneous pattern for instance the dl showed a higher expansion from 1990 to 2000 0 20 0 004 km2 whereas the pl showed a higher expansion of 0 15 0 003 km2 from 1975 to 1990 table 6 similar results have been reported by earlier studies during recent decades the glacial lakes have greatly expanded in high regions of asia characterizing the outstanding regional differences in lake area change which are indicative of inhomogeneous climate warming for example the lake area increased at average rate of 0 8 1 0 a 1 in the himalayas qinghai tibetan plateau in china and tian shan mountains 20 60 in the eastern himalayas and 17 in the middle himalayas of hkh region generally due to climate warming wang et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 based on the expansion studies of lakes in the central himalayan region about 67 glacial lakes have been identified as rapidly expanding lakes nie et al 2013 in general an expanding lake is considered to have an imbalanced water budget where the glacial meltwater and precipitation inputs outbalances evaporation or discharge outputs thus the temperature precipitation and evaporation are considered the common climatic factors that control the glacial lakes changes there are several past studies that have attributed the rapid expansion of glacial lakes to the climate warming and increasing glacier melt precipitation increase and evaporation decrease bolch et al 2012 wang et al 2013 the formation and rapid expansion of ice contact lakes is a more direct signal of temperature rise resulting in increase of glacier melt jain and mir 2017 the conversion of form of precipitation from solid to liquid due to the rising temperature a common phenomenon observed in the western himalayan region mir et al 2015a b 2017 may also be a major factor of rapid lake expansion as a result of higher glacier thinning and wastage however an analysis of the glacial lake expansion in this study showed that the continuous and rapid recession rates of dg and pg may in turn be linked to the development and enlargement of these proglacial lakes at their snouts that is the higher and rapid recession of dg and pg is due to the rapid disintegration wasting of glacier ice front through ice calving activity at the termini besides other factors probably in response to the climate change and warming pattern in the area chevuturi et al 2016 this observation is further supported by the presence of crevasses and cracks on the present studied glaciers ablation zones termini there are many field based measurements and or glacial hydrological modeling studies which have indicated that the development of moraine dammed glacial lakes might be largely related to glacier retreat and down wasting calving of ice yamada and sharma 1993 richardson and reynolds 2000a quincey et al 2007 conversely the ice calving into the lake could have been the key mechanism for the faster and up glacier growth of the lakes after its formation otherwise downward expansion of lakes would have also been large in the present case the terminus disintegration might be higher due to the debris free nature of the glacier ablation areas it is reported that the glacier contact proglacial lakes expand upstream by promoting calving and subaerial melting at the debris free glacier terminus gardelle et al 2011 this is because the proglacial lakes have a marked impact on glacier dynamics as they modify the stress regime of the glacier ice in contact basnett et al 2013 mir and majeed 2016 the presence of proglacial lakes also transmits thermal energy to the ice front accelerating melting calving which leads to enhanced glacier retreat komori 2008 sakai 2012 basnett et al 2013 mir and majeed 2016 additionally the observed upstream lake expansion of the present debris free glaciers is a phenomenon similarly observed in most other proglacial lakes in contact with debris covered glaciers song et al 2016 past studies have also reported that the glacier fed lakes expand rapidly for example in the poiqu river basin glacier fed lakes expanded significantly by 122 1 from 1976 to 2010 whereas non glacier fed lakes remained stable 2 8 this contrast in glacial lake growth is because the glacier fed lakes are influenced by glacial retreat and melting e g subaerial melting water line melting and ice calving gardelle et al 2011 as compared to the non glacier fed lakes thus with retreat and melting of mother glaciers glacier fed lakes will receive a larger area to expand which typically results in lake expansion the contrasting patterns of glacier fed lakes and non glacier fed lakes verify the importance of glacial retreat with regard to lake expansion on a regional scale 7 3 susceptibility of glof hazards from dalung and padam lakes in this study using the remote sensing data in conjunction with high resolution virtual ge images 5m conditions of the glaciers associated lakes and their surroundings have been investigated in detail based on integrated criteria of standard and essential indices table 2 the following facts regarding the future development and the danger of existing lakes were drawn after analysis both the lakes were found moraine dammed having areas more than a threshold value of 0 10 km2 with a volume of more than 10 million m3 considered in this study previously the minimum magnitude of 0 1 km2 has been taken by several studies as the threshold for the analysis of glof events for example a similar threshold has been taken in chinese himalaya lv 1999 wang et al 2012a b tien shan mountains etc wang et al 2013 additionally the area of the present lakes is also higher than a threshold value of 0 2 km2 which possess a potential danger suggested some researchers mool et al 2001 che et al 2004 in general the larger lakes are considered more hazardous than smaller lakes as the lakes with larger areas are generally deeper and may exert higher hydrostatic pressures over the dams making them more susceptible to failure richardson and reynolds 2000b the larger lakes have also a greater surface area potentially exposed to more mass movement and ice avalanche impacts it is also notable that the dynamics of the parent glaciers are directly associated with glof occurrence and the distance between the lake and parent glacier is the most direct measure of the degree of their linkage in the chinese himalaya a horizontal distances of less than 500 m between the lake and parent glacier has been reported for all the recorded glof events lv 1999 however the presently selected lakes are located at the snout connected with mother glaciers and therefore can be affected directly by the dynamics of the parent glaciers such as ice calving activity and the sudden floating of the dead ice during the last three decades a continuous glacier recession has resulted in a progressive growth and expansion of the lake areas e g 20 3 4 expansion of dl and 58 4 5 of pl the lakes have attained a continuous and rapid up glacier growth which was examined by using overlaying of the lake outlines of different time periods the lakes have also witnessed down glacier growth large amount in case of pl than the dl which was however very little and hence considered insignificant fig 6 a b the expanding lakes are considered the more hazardous than the lakes which remain stable or shrink the examples of minor moraine dammed lake area reduction that are not related to glofs have been observed in patagonia loriaux and casassa 2013 the slope of glaciers termini and lake outlets is higher than a threshold value of 7 and 10 in both cases there is also a steep gradient of the emerging stream from the lakes a small distance to the outlet of the basin main river and settlement areas previously it has been reported that the high dams which produce outbursts with high peak discharges usually have steep outlets walder and o connor 1997 similarly the other indices such as glacier areas slope between the mother glaciers and lakes top width of the moraine dams are higher than the defined criteria see table 2 thereby suggesting that the lakes are potentially dangerous since the first appearance of these lakes the growth rate is almost rapid and continuous and it is very likely that the lakes will continue to grow this is because 1 the proglacial lakes have a marked impact on glacier dynamics as they tend to modify the stress regime of the glacier ice in contact basnett et al 2013 and increase the terminus disintegration by the process of calving and accelerating melting komori 2008 sakai 2012 basnett et al 2013 mir and majeed 2016 moreover 2 the debris free ablation zones of these glaciers have a gentle slope i e 10 15 for a considerable length of 1 km which may provide favorable conditions to further accelerate the glacier retreat and up glacier lake growth the glaciers with a low angle terminus are the indicators of negative mass balance consequently the lakes in contact with moderately flat glacier fronts are likely to grow as a consequence of glacier retreat frey et al 2010 thus the continuous glacier ice melting will produce a large volume of water thereby increasing the hydrostatic pressure against the moraine dams which consist mostly of unconsolidated loose poorly sorted sediments and granular glacial deposits which are highly susceptible to failure in the himalayan region the glacial lakes are commonly dammed by the moraines which are normally unstable due to the unconsolidated composition jain et al 2012 agarwal et al 2013 however it is important to mention that the presence of any channels may relatively help in draining the excess melt water and reduce the increasing water level hydrostatic pressure for example there are narrow spillways channels present in case of moraine dams of the present lakes in case of dl the channel has a width of about 5 m whereas in case of pl the channel is comparatively wider having a width of about 15 m however the influence of these channels on drainage of surplus water that might have been produced during last decades as a result of observed rapid glacier recession seems to be insignificant this is because the lakes have indicated a rapid and continuous expansion from 1970s reflecting an increase in the area and probably the volume hydrostatic pressure of the melt water however to elaborately understand this phenomenon water level change studies of these lakes should be carried out in the future moreover the creation of icebergs due to the ice calving activity or floating of dead ice at the glacier termini of these glaciers can t be ignored the floating icebergs are clearly identifiable on ge images especially in case of dl the icebergs can cause blockade of the channels and raise the water level potentially overtopping and breaching the dam there is also a high probability of blockade of these channels due to the debris fall flow from the surrounding high elevated side slopes and adjacent tributary glacier valleys especially during the periods of high intensity precipitation bookhagen et al 2005 presently large deposits of debris are also present mainly in the form of alluvial fans scree deposits adjacent to these lakes occurrence of intense and frequent extreme precipitation events like cloudbursts due to climate change dash et al 2007 nandargi and dhar 2011 is the most probable factor for dam failure overall in the ladakh region occurrences of six flood events due to cloud bursts in a short span of six years since 2005 have been reported recently thayyen et al 2013 as reported the cloud bursts have triggered a devastating debris flow landsliding in this region hobley et al 2012 in the indian himalayan region flash flooding glofs landslides etc resulting from sudden downpours due to cloudbursts is very common in the monsoonal season raj 2010 dimri et al 2016 thayyen et al 2013 most importantly for the development of pdgls the down wasting of the glacier tongues is an essential factor among the recorded glof events in the himalayas the north american cordillera and the tropical andes slope movements such as ice avalanches rockfall and landslides have been found to be the most frequent glof triggers clague and evans 2000 richardson and reynolds 2000a b emmer and cochachin 2013 however the likelihood of an ice avalanche impacting a lake depends on the distance slope and roughness of the terrain between the glacier and the lake therefore to locate the site of ice calving and avalanches in these areas a detailed study of the glacier morphology and topography of the surroundings have been taken into account first the longitudinal profiles a b were generated starting from the lower end of the moraine dams to the head walls of the glaciers fig 7 a b the calculated longitudinal profiles shed light on the possible sites of ice calving upslope of the lakes for instance a convex area with a steep gradient is present at a distance of 1 5 km slope 45 above dl and 1 25 km slope 25 above pl that might cause ice detachment wasting or sliding into the lakes in the coming years this observation is further supported by the presence of a dense network of transverse crevasses cracks at the steep part of the ablation zones of the glaciers fig 8 a b the presence of transverse crevasses may facilitate the rapid ice detachment by facilitating higher penetration of the glacier meltwater or rainfall produced as a result of climate change the penetration of the water into the glacier may affect the glacier movement by influencing the stress distribution at the glacier bed and thereby the rate at which the ice slides over the bed however presently the large ices avalanche calving at the glaciers termini is unlikely to occur because of the gentle slope and low elevation of the ice front but due to the continuous and progressive glacier retreat the successive lake growth and expansion is certain to increase and to reach the steep site of ice avalanche zone secondly the presence of steeper surroundings around the lakes particularly towards right side can be a probable source of mass movement i e rockfall or slide fig 8a b the steep unvegetated slopes are a common source of mass movements peduzzi 2010 large and high velocity mass movement landslides can generate impulse waves of hundreds of meters of run up that can easily over top dams starting progressive erosion and lake drainage walder et al 2003 to analyze these factors both the study areas were divided into five slope classes using the aster dem after the classification of reynolds 2000 as shown in fig 9 a b the slopes steeper particularly more than 45 are considered the dangerous and probable source areas for mass movements alean 1985 bolch et al 2011 as found the gradient of the slopes surrounding the lakes is very steep at most of the areas particularly towards the south of the dl and south west of pl also see fig 8a b the mass movements of ice and rock are the most common trigger of recorded glof events in the himalayas as well richardson and reynolds 2000 and the frequency of such triggering may be directly influenced by warming of the climate system deline et al 2014 mass movement impacts have been related to outburst floods in patagonia and other andean regions hubbard et al 2005 harrison et al 2006 however in the himalayas the cause of the outbursts has been reported mostly by the ice avalanches on the mother glacier tongues by analyzing earlier glofs ding and liu 1992 lv 1999 furthermore the characteristics of the moraines and the freeboard were manually addressed based on the aster dem the freeboard was observed to be low 10 m limited freeboard between the crest of the moraine dam and the lake level facilitate the waves to overtop the moraine dam reynolds 2003 there is also a large difference between the elevation at which the lakes are present and confluence point where the stream emerging from the lakes join the main rivers for instance the pl and dl are located approximately at an elevation of 4500 m and 4350 m a s l whereas the confluence points are located at an elevation of 3750 m and 4050 m a s l respectively in addition the relative height between the lake water levels and base levels of the terminal moraine dams is 4373 and 4348 m a s l i e 25 m dl and 4496 m and 4476 m i e 20 m pl that is similar to widely known imja tsho 20 m which is regarded as one of the important pdgl in the nepal himalayas icimod 2011 the climate is one of the important factors as regards to creation and stability of moraine dams hansel 2003 the failures of moraine dams is becoming increasingly frequent due to global warming and have occurred in the himalayas european alps north american rockies andes tien shan mountains and pamirs reynolds 2000 nevertheless the frequency and magnitude of moraine dam failures and glofs will continue to increase with the current and continued scenario of rising temperatures and increased variability of precipitation rgsl 2003 bajracharya et al 2006 the intensity of glofs risk is also at rise due to the risk of a rockfall or an avalanche due to tectonically active zone in this region bilham et al 2011 have postulated an occurrence of m 9 0 earthquake and have estimated a 13 17 mm convergence rate and inferred a locked zone of 200 km width extending from zanskar range to peshawar basin in kohistan range the tectonically active areas and presence of active faults fault zones close to an area that contains moraine dammed lakes is at an elevated risk of experiencing earthquake induced glofs due to the earth quakes if any large and high velocity landslides possess a greater threat for the dam failure in this area thus based on the above discussed factors the pl and dl are suggested potentially dangerous and susceptible to an outburst floods 7 4 comparison of the adopted criteria with other studies assessing the susceptibility of glacial lakes to outburst floods as mentioned earlier a number of methods can be used for the assessment of susceptibility of the glacial lakes to outburst floods however these methods vary considerably based on the parameters considered number and selection of assessed characteristics the level of importance placed upon each parameter the amount and type of required input data and their levels of objectivity emmer and vilímek 2013 it is also notable that the use of various approaches can also lead to different classifications of the hazard associated with an individual glacial lake for instance the imja tsho and chamlang south tsho located in the nepal region have been classified differently by different classifications richardson and reynolds 2000a examined the processes of formation and development of potentially hazardous glacial lakes in the himalayas and discussed briefly technical and implementation issues associated with hazard assessment and mitigation considering these facts in the present study the maximum number of criterion indicators about 16 indicators as found in literature have been used remote sensing data have been used to derive these indicators to analyze and classify the lakes as pdgls a standard approach was adopted based on glacier dynamics glacial lake dynamics dam characteristics and down valley status topographic features around the lakes and glaciers and thresholds for indicating pdgls previously worni et al 2013 have classified both the lakes as critically potential based on the condition of the dam similarly raj 2010 also classified the padam lake as dangerous additionally wang et al 2012a b based on almost similar criteria identified about 142 pdmdls in the chinese himalaya another study by khanal et al 2015 have identified 10 pdgls poiqu bhotekoshi sun koshi river basin in the central himalayas jha and khare 2017 have identified 2 pdgls using similar approach in dhauliganga basin garhwal himalaya aggarwal et al 2013 have reported 18 pdgls in the teesta basin sikkim himalaya using the similar approach in general the adopted approach can be used for the glof risk assessment in a time and cost effective manner through the application of remote sensing with or without in situ surveys in combination with other tools 7 5 glof simulation and risk assessment in the present study an integrated criteria based on 16 indices frequently used by the researchers indicated that the selected glacial lakes are potentially dangerous for example the lake area changes reflected the state of hydric balance of the lakes the rapid glacier retreat and subsequent changes in the lake areas may disturb the hydric balance thus promoting moraine dammed lake outbursts therefore taking into account the availability of data obtained from remote sensing not including fieldwork the glacial lake outburst flood modeling was carried out the breaching and failure of the moraine dams was considered due to the overtopping and increased hydrostatic pressure against the moraine dams as a result of increased glacier melt resulting due to rapid glacier shrinkage wastage the over topping of the lakes may result due to waves generated by the rockfall ice avalanche into the lakes considering this an attempt has been made to generate the flood hydrographs and to model semi quantitatively the glofs at the lake and downstream sites using one dimensional mike 11 model as mentioned the dl is located in a tributary catchment of suru river and therefore the dam breach flood i e glof has been routed through the suru river for a total length of 35 km from the lake up to a major village where another major tributary confluences with it the river profile has been represented in the model as a stream line with a number of cross sections considering a breach width of 60 and 25 m the flood hydrographs at the lake site and at the downstream outlet site has been generation fig 10 a the simulation revealed a total flood peak due to glof at the lake site of 3361 7 m3 s 1 same flood peak gets mitigated to 1520 9 m3 s 1 at the outlet the time of travel of flood peak from the lake site to outlet is about 1 h and 42 min there is almost a half attenuation of the flood wave magnitude between the lake site and the outlet site table 7 similarly the pl is located in a tributary catchment of tsarap basin and therefore dam breach flood i e glof has been routed first through tributary stream followed by main tsarap river up to its confluence with the stod river at padam town the stod and tsarap rivers after confluence give rise to the zanskar river the river profile from pl site down to the catchment outlet has a total length of 50 km in this case simulations have been carried out for a breach width of 67 and 27 m the flood hydrographs produced at the lake site revealed a glof peak of 4210 3 m3 s 1 same flood peak gets mitigated to 1722 4 m3 s 1 at the outlet fig 10b the time of travel of flood peak from the lake site to the outlet was estimated to be about 1 h and 40 min for pl there is almost a one third attenuation of the flood wave magnitude between the lake site and the outlet site table 7 from these results it is inferred that the high glof peak discharge downstream at a distance of 50 km has a higher potential for hazard in case of pl failure nevertheless the minimum travel distance 35 km to catchment outlet and steep slope in case dl can also cause a worse scenario of glof past studies have reported an enormous glof event from dig tsho nepal in 1985 bajracharya and mool 2009 that resulted in a flood wave of 600 2000 m3 s 1 viuchard and zimmerman 1987 with enormous consequences noticeable even 90 km below the dammed lake richardson and reynolds 2000a in addition the modeled results of flood hydrographs of the present study lakes are more or less similar to the past studies for instance agarwal et al 2013 using the same mike 11 one dimensional model have estimated almost a similar flood hydrograph of 2611 136 m3 s 1 at lake site and 1417 844 m3 s 1 at the outlet site in tista basin skim himalaya similarly thakur et al 2016 estimated a similar flood discharge peak of 1394 28 1552 04 and 1898 04 m3 s 1 for a breach width of 40 60 and 80 m at the downstream sites in the dhauliganga river of alaknanda basin western himalaya however raj 2010 used empirical formulas and estimated a peak discharge varying from 1 7 196 m3 s 1 for the padam lake that is however significantly lower than the presently modeled peak discharge additionally the past studies have reported peak discharges of 2500 3600 m3 s 1 in case of glof from glacial lake lc2 in patagonia chile jacquet et al 2017 2500 m3 s 1 of luggye tsho in bhutan richardson and reynolds 2000a 4500 m3 s 1 of gelhaipuco lake in china chen et al 2013 3690 m3 s 1 of qubixiama cho lake in china ligg 1988 the glof can attain a peak discharge of 30 000 m3 s 1 and travel a distance of 200 km richardson and reynolds 2000a however it is notable that the magnitude of risk associated with outburst floods depend upon the downstream density of settlements and infrastructures in case of high population density and costly infrastructure high fatalities and damage could be inflicted by even small outburst floods the dalung and padam valleys are almost uninhabited downstream for approximately 10 km from dl and about 20 km from pl however many people from farther downstream commute and also install temporary huts within a major part of the suru and tsarap river valleys through which the glofs have been routed during the summer season april october for grazing their yaks sheep and goats there is also frequent inflow of tourists into these areas during summers in addition a major padam town district leh is located in the tsarap river valley which consist a few hundred households and thousands of people their property livestock crops and agricultural land along with several bridges irrigation canals and military camps in the flood routed prone areas rizvi 1996 schettler et al 1981 in this town there are other several government administrative units a post office internet cafes and telephone booths a number of notable buddhist monasteries such as bardan monasteryandkursha monastery in addition there are also several hotels home stays restaurants and tea shops meant for tourists rizvi 1996 osada et al 2000 similarly the downstream areas of the suru valley is inhabited by 25 000 people rizvi 1996 near therangdum village there is the famous rangdum monasterybelonging to thegelugpasect of tibetan buddhism and a summer tent camp meant for tourists however there is limited number of other facilities for visitors in this valley but the lower areas of this valley are considered one of the most agriculturally productive parts of ladakh region with the cultivation two crops a year schettler et al 1981 rizvi 1996 in this study the critical information needed to assess glof hazards have been achieved through a detailed study of glacier recession and associated lake formation and its expansion topography around the lakes and glof modeling this study integrated remote sensing and high resolution gei and one dimensional flood modeling studies which have not been achieved previously in spite of the assumptions and limitations as outlined below the adopted approach for indicating pdgls and hydrodynamic modeling is found to be good enough as it provides reasonable estimate of glofs thus enabling the appropriate estimation of flood design however future research pertaining to the calculations of size of potential displacement waves estimation of volume of ice or rockfall that may detach from the glaciers or steep mountain slopes water level changes of the lakes and a detailed field survey to assess the risk in the downstream areas for the more reliable evaluation of these pdgls is suggested limitations of the approach applied in this study 1 a number of remotely sensed images can be used to observe the changes in glacial lakes and expansion mechanisms for monitoring purposes however relying only on remote sensing data is inadequate as it cannot provide the necessary bathymetric information changes in the height of the damming moraine and other moraine dam properties such as the presence of bedrock ice and pipes or changes in lake level cui et al 2003 which are also important additionally the geometry parameters of the dam and parent glaciers as derived from aster gdem may include inaccuracies frey et al 2010 fujita et al 2008 therefore high resolution satellite images such as spot5 2 5 m resolution in the panchromatic band and ikonos 1 m resolution in the panchromatic band images may provide alternative data for the analysis 2 the studied pdgls are located at higher elevations 4300 m in the himalayas where permafrost are normally developed the interactions and chain reactions of permafrost thaw in a lake basin due to atmospheric warming will also possibly reduce the stability of the moraine dam however due to the absence of suitable data e g multi temporal optical or sar data and the limitations of remote sensing based studies it was difficult to obtain the physical characteristics of permafrost and the stability of the moraine dam and other permafrost related activities in the present work 3 glacial lake outburst flood modeling process is an approximation of a physical phenomenon through which the physical phenomenon and its effects are studied for water resources structure design and flood management in glof modeling assumptions were mainly associated with the breach parameters especially breach width and breach depth which may have impact on flood peak and arrival times 8 conclusions the present study has been carried out to study the glacier recession glacier surface area changes glacial lake expansion and topography around lakes to determine the lake s development and dynamic processes and to assess the prospect of glofs using multi temporal satellite data and one dimensional breach modeling over a period of last five decades the area of dg and pg has respectively shrunk by 2 64 0 56 km2 19 2 4 1 at a rate of 0 05 0 01 km2 a 1 and 3 4 0 65 km2 12 71 2 4 at a rate of 0 06 0 01 km2 a 1 from 1962 to 2015 during the same time period the dg retreated by 1240 140 m 15 7 0 17 at a rate of 23 3 0 m a 1 whereas the pg has retreat by 2690 210 m 21 3 1 67 at a rate of 50 7 4 0 m a 1 the sla ela has risen from 4807 m to 5080 m a s l in case of dg whereas it has gone up from 4920 m to 5210 m a s l in case of pg from 1975 to 2015 the glacier recession and areal changes were found to be rapid and continuous during the studied period as a consequence of glacier recession proglacial lakes dammed by moraine deposits have appeared after 1962 and have expanded continuously up slope from 1970 s the area of dl has expanded by 0 32 0 03 km2 0 20 0 004 0 48 0 009 km2 from 1990 to 2015 whereas the pl area has expanded by 0 41 0 008 km2 0 17 0 007 0 58 0 01 km2 from 1975 to 2015 moreover the present glaciers have an extensive possibility of further upslope recession due to the presence of gentle gradient 15 up to a distance of 1 km and debris free ablation zones in the future consequently the associated lakes have also a wide possibility of expansion associated with glacier recession based on an integrated criterion of standard indices as used in this study the lakes were indicated as potentially dangerous the terminal moraine dams consisting unconsolidated composition and the pronounced altitude difference between the lake and the base of the moraine dam the dams are highly susceptible to failure the steep slopes around the lakes and steep gradient 30 in the glacier ablation zones are considered potential sites for mass movements trigging an outburst flood thus using the one dimensional mike 11 model the flood hydrographs were generated with a peak discharge of 3361 7 m3 a 1 and 4210 3 m3 a 1 at lake sites of dl and pl the flood peak of dl gets mitigated to 1520 9 m3 a 1 and that of pl gets mitigated to 1722 4 m3 a 1at the outlet sites the high glof peak discharge of pl downstream at a distance of 50 km has a higher potential for hazards whereas the minimum travel distance of dl 35 km to the catchment outlet and its steep slope can cause a worse scenario of glof therefore a regular monitoring of the lakes is recommended acknowledgements the authors are grateful to the nasa for making the landsat and aster gdem datasets freely available

7075,glacier recession and formation of glacial lakes along with outburst flood hazards are increasing in response to changing climate in the himalayan region this study describes evolution of dalung

dalung glacier dg and lake dl are present in suru river catchment whereas the padam glacier pg and lake pl are present in tsarap river catchment of zanskar basin western himalaya from 1962 to 2015 the dg and pg have shrunk at different rates the dg has shrunk by 2 6 0 56 km2 19 2 4 1 at a rate of 0 05 0 01 km2 a 1 whereas the pg has shrunk by 3 4 0 65 km2 12 7 2 4 at a rate of 0 06 0 01 km2 a 1 the frontal recession was recorded as 1 240 0 02 km 15 7 2 0 at a rate of 20 0 4 m a 1 for dg and 2 690 0 5 m 21 3 2 1 at a rate of 50 7 0 1 m a 1 for pg consequently the proglacial glacial lakes have formed indicating an expansion of 20 3 4 dl and 58 4 5 pl during 1990 2015 using integrated criteria of standard indices for the identification of potentially dangerous glacial lakes pdgls the lakes were found to be vulnerable and have a potential to cause breaching in the coming years in order to provide inputs for the emergency action plan one dimensional mike 11 model was used to generate the peak flood hydrographs at the lake and other vulnerable sites downstream highest peak discharge of 3361 7 m3 s 1 dl and 4210 3 m3 s 1 pl were estimated at the lake sites which has reduced to 1520 9 m3 s 1 and 1722 4 m3 s 1 respectively at the outlet sites the reduced discharge at downstream sites still bears the potential to create dangerous flood hazards keywords zanskar dalung padam glacier retreat glof mike 11 1 introduction the climate change has caused a continuous glacier recession and emergence of glacial lakes behind the newly exposed unstable moraines in most of the glaciated regions of the world zemp et al 2009 bolch et al 2012 like other regions the formation of glacial lakes in the himalayas in response to climate change is a new development and most of the lakes in this region have formed within the last five decades raj 2010 a majority of these lakes are behind loosely consolidated end moraine dams typically composed of poorly consolidated and inherently unstable glacial material until recent past a number of glacial lakes have been identified and found expanding owing to climate change and glacier thinning reynolds 2000 benn et al 2000 lohani 2015 mir et al 2017 jain and mir 2017 the moraines provide a physical barrier to glacial melt water drainage which ultimately leads to formation of moraine dammed glacial lakes costa and schuster 1988 with a potential to form a glacial lake outburst flood glof hazard westoby et al 2014 worni et al 2014 lohani 2015 normally two types of glacial lakes are recognized i proglacial lakes and ii supraglacial lakes the proglacial lakes often grow downstream of steep glaciers where water is collected behind former moraines richardson and reynolds 2000a komori 2008 due to the recession of glacier terminus frey et al 2010 westoby et al 2014 the supraglacial lakes develop on the surface of glacier itself and grow by coalescence of small ponds richardson and reynolds 2000a benn et al 2012 these glacial lakes have the capacity to impound large volumes of melt water in excess of 106 107 m3 following the continuous lake expansion sakai et al 2000 janský et al 2009 somos valenzuela et al 2014 due to the impounded huge volumes of water and unstable nature of moraine deposits such lakes have high tendency of breaching and therefore are expected to be hazardous in case of any breaching the resulting rapid discharge burst of massive amounts of water and debris is known as glacial lake outburst flood glof such a glof can be catastrophic in downstream areas in mountainous regions such as himalayas richardson and reynolds 2000a several major glofs in the asian territory have been previously reported and studied in detail which include the luggye tsho in bhutan himalaya watanabe and rothacher 1996 tam pokhari in mt everest region osti and egashira 2009 and lake zyndan in tien shan narama et al 2009 further past studies covering more lake outbursts also include bajracharya et al 2007 narama et al 2009 hewitt and liu 2010 jain et al 2010 chen et al 2010 icimod 2011 jain et al 2015a lohani 2015 2016 lohani et al 2015 jain et al 2015b lohani and jain 2016 and aggarwal et al 2013 thus the risks to human life and property located downstream of potentially hazardous glacial lakes pdgls of the himalayan region have augmented due to frequent glacier recession and glof events reported during past several decades at least 14 glof events have been reported in nepal icimod 2011 30 in the tibet autonomous region tar in china liu et al 2013 and 21 in bhutan komori et al 2012 and 5 in the hunza basin pakistan ashraf et al 2012 previous studies have revealed an occurrence of glof about 450 years ago along the seti khola ives 2010 the first glof event in the indian himalaya has been reported in 1926 from the shyok glacier jammu and kashmir which has caused tremendous destruction of abudan village and the surrounding land covering a distance of 400 km from the outburst source mason 1929 an outburst of landslide dammed lake at parechu river china during june 2005 caused a transboundary flood in himachal pradesh india chorabari lake in kedarnath india was a very disastrous recent event in the year 2013 jain et al 2013 in the hindu kush himalayan hkr region 8000 glacial lakes and 209 pdgls 26 in nepal ives et al 2010 24 in bhutan kattelmann 2003 30 in india bajracharya et al 2007 52 in pakistan ashraf et al 2012 and 77 in china bajracharya et al 2007 have been reported similarly in an attempt worni et al 2013 have provided an inventory of 103 glacial lakes for indian himalayan region in which three potentially hazardous lakes have been studied in detail in response to recent climate warming scenario the glacial lakes have greatly expanded in the hkh region gardelle et al 2011 zhang et al 2015 overall the lake area is reported to have increased at an average rate of 0 8 1 0 a 1 in the himalayas qinghai tibetan plateau in china and tian shan mountains wang et al 2012a b zhang et al 2015 in the eastern and middle himalayas the lake area has increased by 20 60 and 17 contrary to expansion it is also reported that the lake area has declined by 30 50 in the karakoram and hindu kush mountains in general the rapid expansion or formation of lakes as a result of ice melt at the margins of receding glaciers in response to climate change potentially increase the possibility of glofs barros et al 2014 field et al 2012 considering the above facts the glacial lakes particularly the pdgls should be monitored regularly so as to process mitigation measures well in time and to warn people before any serious upcoming hazard however this is difficult cumbersome and time consuming employing conventional methods owing to inaccessibility and harsh weather conditions prevailing at high altitude himalayan regions instead the modern techniques of geographic information system gis and remote sensing are highly suitable which enable rapid analysis of large areas and number in an inexpensive and economical act huggel et al 2002b kääb et al 2005 these techniques are more specific and advantageous to identify vulnerable lakes in a particular region and help carry out detailed studies like glof modeling and risk assessment in order to discover any potential risk to down lake communities or infrastructure bajracharya et al 2007 mergili and schneider 2011 worni et al 2012 it is pertinent to mention that the modeling of glofs is usually similar to the dam break study of the moraine dams jain et al 2012 2015b generally the scaled physical hydraulic models or mathematical simulation models are frequently used for the dam break flood simulation studies wecs 1987 carrivick 2006 bajracharya et al 2007 the zanskar basin a part of western indian himalayan or hkh region is highly glaciated with about 697 glaciers sangewar and shukhla 2009 the glaciers have exhibited dominantly a retreating trend despite advancing nature of certain glaciers during recent past nathawat et al 2008 kamp et al 2011 pandey et al 2011 ghosh et al 2014 mir and majeed 2016 like other regions the glacier recession has resulted in the formation and expansion of glacial lakes in this area as well in this area indications of earlier flash floods or glofs far upstream have been reported in the ladakh mountain range running parallel to the zanskar mountain range gergan et al 2009 but till date a complete inventory of glacier lakes indicating the number of pdgls and their detailed study on risk assessment and glof simulations are unavailable in this area except a brief few studies for example worni et al 2013 recently carried out the mapping and classification of few glacial lakes in terms of glof in this basin as a part of glacial lake inventory for the whole indian himalaya additionally raj 2010 has studied a lake for glof assessment in the zanskar basin using remote sensing and empirical equations in the present study two benchmark glaciers and lakes present in the zanskar basin were selected for a detailed temporal evolution study using satellite data an assessment of the glof hazards to the downstream areas from selected lakes has also been attempted the one dimensional mike 11 model was used for glof modeling in this study 2 the study area the present study areas dalung and padam glaciers lakes are a part of zanskar basin western himalaya fig 1 the elevation of the zanskar basin varies from 3070 to 6400 m a s l with a mean elevation of 4735 m a s l the zanskar basin is situated between the greater himalayan range ghr and ladakh mountain ranges and holds a multiple glacial records mitchell et al 1999 the area is drained by two major rivers such as the suru river flowing towards northwest direction and stod river flowing towards southeast direction the suru and stod rivers take opposite flowing directions at pensi la 4030 m a s l the pensi la pensi pass is called the gateway to zanskar and also acts as a water divide for the suru and stod rivers the glaciers having various dimensions are mainly concentrated on the northern aspect in the valley however due to the snow accumulation on the glaciers by the influence of south asian summer monsoon mostly valley glaciers and tongue glaciers are formed in the zanskar mountain range kamp et al 2011 one notable feature of the glaciers in the zanskar basin is that a significant number of clean glaciers are present with lesser amount of debris cover in addition to glaciers having ablation areas covered heavily with debris the zanskar basin hosts several famous glaciers such as durung drung parkachik pensilungpa haskira kange and hagshu besides other large number of glaciers it is important to note that the names of the glaciers are normally mentioned and adopted according to the survey of india topographic soi maps but these maps didn t mention any name for the padam glacier selected for the present study therefore the name padam is adopted for the glacier based on its nearest major locality that is padam town another reason for the selection of name padam is that the flood hazard has been routed up to padam town from the lake in this area padam town is the major and only administrative tehsil of kargil district jammu and kashmir india but sac 2016 has named the padam glacier as katkar glacier in its report probably due to a small katkar nala that emerges from the glacier accordingly based on the mother glaciers name the lakes are also assigned the proper names hereafter the selected glaciers and lakes will be designated as dg dalung glacier dl dalung lake pg padam glacier and pl padam lake the geographical coordinates of dl are as n33 56 22 e76 13 43 and those of pl are as n33 09 27 e76 59 05 the dg is having a total catchment area of about 39 km2 flows from the peaks of the greater himalaya located towards northwest of pensi la it contributes to the suru river which flows in northwest direction the pg is located in the tsarap sub basin of zanskar basin which flows towards the north east and joins the river stod at padam town from the pg a small tributary stream called as katkar nala emerges and joins with another glacier fed small stream reru phu near sumdo the katkar and reru phu streams run over a small distance from the source glaciers before their final confluence with the main tsarap river of the basin in other words the katkar forms a small sub tributary catchment of the main tsarap river catchment the river stod is also known as the doda which flows south east from pensi la towards padam and merges with the river tsarap to create the zanskar river the pg has a catchment area of about 118 km2 the snout altitude of dg and pg for the year 2015 is 4031 m and 3942 m a s l respectively overall the equilibrium line altitude ela for the glaciers in this region with a northwest northeast orientation is between 5200 m and 5400 m a s l burbank and fort 1985 the accumulation of snow mass accumulation on these glaciers occurs through direct snowfall blowing snow and avalanche the zanskar mountain range is a high altitude semi desert lying on the northern flank of the ghr the ghr acts as a climatic barrier preventing the area from most of the monsoons and develops a rain shadow zone the area receives most of the snowfall during winter season because of the western disturbances and rainfall during the summer season while the mean annual precipitation in zanskar region is reported about 250 mm the weather at leh station 3506 m a s l which is close to the zanskar basin records a mean annual precipitation of about 93 mm klimes 2003 archer and fowler 2004 the pattern of precipitation changes from southeast to northwest of the region as the northwestern part is in proximity to the pensi la pass en route to an air mass link to pamirs the snowfall ranges between 2 05 and 6 84 mm at padam and 7 25 12 mm in the durung drung glacier valley raina and koul 2011 however the precipitation in this region occasionally occurs as rain at lower elevations the mean annual maximum and minimum temperature varies from 23 7 c august and 15 6 c january at leh station singh 1998 as reported the mean maximum temperature at the durung drung glacier in zanskar valley varies from 18 23 to 7 96 c during the summer season whereas the mean minimum temperature ranges between 1 32 and 7 8 c shukla and qadir 2016 in this region the wide range of fluctuations in winter temperature is primarily caused by western disturbances of winter season october april raina and koul 2011 this is probably due to the increasing northward aridity in this region having valley glaciers that are mainly restricted to the ghr and zanskar ranges however in the northern ladakh and karakoram ranges the cirque glaciers are commonly found and valley glaciers are rarely formed kamp et al 2011 3 data used in this study the soi topographic maps 1 50 000 satellite data of landsat

that the data images must be snow free and cloud free or with minimum snow cover and cloud cover so that these features can be visible for the himalayan region this kind of data is generally available during september to november months of the year thus the choice of data is limited to these three months furthermore available data must be free from anomalies due to defective or inefficient sensors the soi topographic maps provide essential old detailed topographic information and therefore these maps were used as the base map for glacier and lake evolution studies however there are several studies which have reported problems of glacial extent demarcation on the soi maps e g bhambri and bolch 2009 mir et al 2017 but in this study we have observed that the glacial extent demarcation on soi maps of 1962 matched well with the landsat image of 1975 except near the glaciers tongues where the temporal changes are obvious the landsat series of satellites provided longest continuous record of satellite based observations and are available at no cost for the public use the landsat is an important resource for monitoring glacier recession and glacial lake expansion and is also a main source of medium spatial resolution earth observations used in decision making woodcock et al 2008 chander et al 2009 the liss iii images were used to assist the mapping of pg pl on landsat etm scene of 2005 because this image has data gaps due to the scan line error produced by the slc scan line corrector failure since early summer 2003 aster dem was used to generate the spatial information like catchment area elevation slope contour co ordinates of points etc aster is an imaging instrument that is flying on the terra satellite launched in december 1999 as a part of nasa s earth observing system eos and produces 30 m resolution elevation data previously the gdem has been used successfully for hydrodynamic modeling in the himalayan region e g sharma et al 2009 jain et al 2012 agarwal et al 2013 therefore this study also involves the use of aster gdem to create the input layers such as stream centerline cross sections and elevation values of it for simulation in one dimensional mike11 hd model 4 methodology for glacier and lake mapping for each phase of mapping multiple images were used to ensure the reliable delineation of glacier and lake boundaries initially the soi maps were scanned and georeferenced using the gis platform the soi maps were used for the co registration of all the satellites images based on about more than 100 ground control points evenly distributed within the whole basin the root mean square error rmse for mss scene was found to be 35 m 0 53 whereas for tm etm scenes it was 15 m 0 5 respectively the liss iii images were orthorectified based on the aster dem before co registration to soi maps and showed a registration error of 20 m 0 67 furthermore the images were geometrically rectified to the same projection system of wgs 84 utm zone 43 overall the rmses obtained were considered accurate for the study from the soi maps the glaciers were directly delineated by manual digitization in gis platform similarly using the landsat mss scene a false color composite fcc consisting bands of 432 rgb was used for the direct manual digitization of the glaciers and lakes the accuracy of manual digitization was controlled within one pixel however it is important to mention that the lakes were not clearly demarcated on soi maps surveyed year 1962 therefore the appearance of these lakes was assumed to be after the year 1962 for the recent year 2015 the glacier and lake extents were delineated from gei directly by on screen digitization that are created as vector data files in kml or kmz format these vector data files were then converted to shp files in arcgis software 10 2 using the tm and etm images the glaciers were first automatically delimited using band ratios of near infrared and shortwave infrared channels i e tm4 tm5 of the images paul et al 2009 because these glaciers are clean type or debris free this approach revealed high reflectance over ice and snow whereas low reflectance over the other terrain similarly for the delineation of glacial lakes a semi automated mapping with a normalized difference water index ndwi was applied using the blue and near infrared channels which express maximum and minimum reflectance differences for glacial water and give good discrimination from ice and snow huggel et al 2002a jain et al 2012 however it is important to note that the effect of shadows on glacier and lake mapping was insignificant in this area and therefore considered negligible still through close visual inspection the misclassified glacier areas if any such as water bodies shadows and isolated rocks were eliminated during post processing i e manual exclusion inclusion of wrongly classified missing areas additionally the aster gdem was used for better visualization and extraction of ice divides and glacier extents wherever possible visual inspection of the glacier lakes and other associated glacial features on gei was highly ensured and any mismatch found was eliminated manually mir et al 2017 the accuracy of manual digitization was controlled within a half pixel after mapping the glacier lake area glacier average length glacier terminus elevation median elevation elevation of snow line altitude equilibrium line altitude sla ela glacier slope orientation and other attribute information was determined in gis platform the mean slope data of both the glaciers was estimated as an average value of all pixels falling in its respective classes intersected by the glacier outlines the mean aspect was estimated by dividing the mean sine by the mean cosine of aspect across all cells guo et al 2015 mir et al 2017 the average mid altitude was derived as the arithmetic mean of all glacier pixel altitudes whereas the median elevation was extracted as the 50th percentile of the cumulative number distribution of pixel elevations as suggested by guo et al 2015 the glacier length was derived manually in this study first a central flow line from the snout to the highest point in the accumulation zone along the maximum length of the glaciers was selected then a band of stripes with a distance of 50 m between each stripe was drawn parallel to the main central flow line of the glaciers the average length of the glacier was then calculated from the intersection of the stripes with the glacier outlines in terms of its retreat for comparison with average length change mir and majeed 2016 mir et al 2017 the termini snout of glaciers were determined through visual interpretation technique based on shape size pattern tone texture and association in satellite images mir et al 2017 in addition the contour maps generated from gdem were also used for locating and determining the altitude of the glacier snouts glacier retreat was measured along the centerline using snout positions delineated on the different satellite datasets the snowline equilibrium line was delineated using standard color combinations of bands rgb such as band 2 band 3 and band 5 of landsat datasets and their visual interpretations østrem 1975 using the proxy that at the end of the melt season the snow line altitude sla remains approximately coincident with equilibrium line altitude ela in the temperate glaciers due to the insignificant extent of superimposed ice zone paterson 1998 rabatel et al 2012 the temporal and spatial changes in slas are an indicator of elas and subsequent changes in glacier mass balance guo et al 2014 the ela discriminates the ablation and accumulation zones of the glacier the utility of remote sensing based sla estimation as a proxy to ascertain the mass variation in glaciers has recently gained popularity in view of their difficult access and dearth of field data mcfadden et al 2011 guo et al 2014 wu et al 2014 mir et al 2014a though less accurate than glaciological methods racoviteanu et al 2008 hanshaw and bookhagen 2014 these proxies are reliable enough to reflect the status of glaciers health pesu 2007 pellika and rees 2009 however it is important to note that the inaccuracy in sla s estimation may be caused by the non optimal date of the satellite data image taken before the timing of maximum ablation or inaccuracies in the classification itself pellikka 2007 the aster dem data were also used for semi automatic delineation of drainage basins watersheds of each glacier lakes and extraction of topographic parameters using archydro tools in arcgis software the river cross section details elevation information at a regular interval of 1 km downstream from both the lakes were also obtained from the dem because of the unavailability of field based details of the river cross sections fig 2 a b the cross sections were created at a closer interval essentially at some critical locations where significant topographical variations existed also a buffer zone of 1 km was created along the river stretch for simulations arcgis software was used to delineate cross sections of the streams originating from dl and pl respectively for this purpose vector layers of the streams and the buffer lines along the streams on both sides of it at a distance of 1 5 km were created the vector layers of river cross sections were overlaid on the dem of the basin using erdas imagine software fig 2a b the spatial profile viewer in erdas was used to create a height cross section profile along a route as it allows to visualize the reflectance spectrum of a poly line of data file values in a single band of data one dimensional mode or in many bands perspective three dimensional mode and helps in interpretation of changes in elevation along a planned route and in identifying the sections of the route which are particularly steep or flat after this along each cross section line of the streams about 100 points were created in arcgis the corresponding elevation values of all these points along each cross section were extracted in gis platform 4 1 uncertainty assessment of glacier and glacial lake mapping the glacier and lake outlines derived from satellite datasets at various spatial and temporal resolutions are subjected to various degrees of uncertainty paul et al 2013 jain and mir 2017 for instance the positional accuracy of the glaciers snout is influenced by the sensor resolution williams et al 1997 and co registration error hall et al 2003 similarly the accuracy of the glacier outlines is influenced by the debris cover on the glaciers paul et al 2013 therefore the quantification of error is crucial to ascertain the accuracy and significance of the results the most accurate way to assess glacier outline errors would be to use high resolution images paul et al 2013 but such a data were not available for our study region still wherever possible the higher resolution images from virtual ge were inspected in conjunction with the landsat images to maintain the accuracy in this study mainly the errors of co registration and glacier lake boundary delineations were considered that might have resulted in different levels of accuracy this is because most of the utilized scenes of landsat series have similar resolutions except liss iii and mss scenes and the glaciers are debris free the linear terminus change uncertainty u was estimated by using the remote sensing uncertainty evaluation formula ye et al 2006 mir et al 2014b 2017 as u a 2 b 2 σ where a and b are the resolutions of images a and b respectively and σ is the registration error of each image to the base image which in this case were the soi maps overall the terminus accuracy was estimated to be 88 11 m for mss image 50 92 m for tm etm images 47 68 m for etm image 43 73 m for liss iii image and 17 16 m for ge images the measurement of uncertainty of glacier area uarea for both the glaciers was obtained by using the following formula ye et al 2006 mir et al 2014b as uarea 2 uv where u is the terminus uncertainty and v is the image pixel resolution the uncertainty a combination of mapping uncertainty and the uncertainty of the misregistration in the area extent of the glaciers was estimated to be 0 01 km2 1 using mss 0 003 km2 0 3 for tm etm image of similar resolutions 0 0025 km2 0 25 for etm image 0 002 km2 0 2 for liss iii image and 0 0001 km2 0 01 for ge images respectively furthermore the uncertainty was also evaluated by comparing the glacier outlines derived from the landsat tm etm 27 m of 2005 and those derived from of irs liss iii image 23 5 m of the same year as suggested by paul et al 2013 the resultant uncertainty was found to be 0 6 in case of soi maps the uncertainty of 0 02 km2 2 was estimated by calculating the area of a buffer around glaciers having a width equal to the digitizing errors rmsr 10 m granshaw and fountain 2006 mir et al 2017 the overall uncertainty values estimated are well within or below the previously reported acceptable ranges racoviteanu et al 2008 bolch et al 2010 mir et al 2014a 2017 for accuracy assessment of glacial lake extents the accuracy of manual digitization using the landsat and liss iii datasets was controlled within quarter pixel 7 m the digitization error of 7 m used as buffer increment resulted in an accuracy of 3 for ge images the accuracy was checked by repeating the digitization of lakes three times by three experts which resulted in an accuracy of approximately 1 the area change uncertainty of the glaciers and its associated lakes for various data scenes for all the time intervals was estimated according to the law of error propagation using a given formula as θ change θ period 1 2 θ period 2 2 where θ period 1 and θ period 2 represent the uncertainties of the glacier outlines in period 1 and period 2 respectively 5 identifying potentially dangerous glacial lakes a substantial number of studies have reported many indices and several criteria e g type of lake and its volume rate of lake formation and growth position of lake dam condition conditions of associated mother glacier activity of supraglacial lakes reaction of glacier to climate change activity of glacier morphometric characteristics of glacier physical conditions of surrounding area presence of dead ice in end moraines situation down valley etc for the identification of pdgls richardson and reynolds 2000a b clague and evans 2000 campbell 2005 mckillop and clague 2007 xin et al 2008 bolch et al 2008a 2011 icimod 2011 mergili and schneider 2011 wang et al 2013 2012a b fujita et al 2013 however uncertainties remain with respect to the choice of most effective criteria with which to objectively evaluate glof probability fujita et al 2013 the detailed field investigations are essential and may be carried out to have a better understanding of above mentioned parameters of glacial lakes but field investigations are generally very difficult and time consuming due to inaccessible mountainous terrain with harsh weather conditions and large involved logistics huggel et al 2003 kääb et al 2005 quincey et al 2005 bolch et al 2011 icimod 2011 mir et al 2014a b therefore remote sensing techniques have proved to be the efficient tools and have been frequently applied for the identification of pdgls during recent decades e g wang et al 2012a b jain et al 2015a kapitsa et al 2017 in this study also the identification of pdgls was attempted with limited but important information acquired through remote sensing techniques for the characterization of the selected glacial lakes i e dl and pl as pdgls the indices and integrated criteria adopted are given in table 2 the criteria were derived from landsat images high resolution gei and aster gdem these indices of the criteria are ordered following che et al 2014 who based on literature review calculated the weightage of frequent application of the indices and then concluded that the frequently used indices as more important criterion in terms of glof assessment for the evaluation of glof hazard a typical trigger event is also essentially required there are a number of causes and mechanisms of triggering glof events fig 3 generally the different triggering mechanisms of glof depend on the position of the lake nature and position of the associated mother glaciers volume of water in the lakes nature of the damming materials physical and topographical conditions and other physical conditions of the surroundings moreover an interaction between the processes linked to these factors may strongly increase the vulnerability of the glacial lakes to glof hazard the pdgls may burst due to triggering by dam failures induced due to area expansion rate of lake up glacier and down valley expansion rate dead ice melting seepage degradation of permafrost seismic activity a flood wave caused due to rock snow or ice avalanche into the lake and abrupt rise in water level due to heavy precipitation consequently a sudden release of huge reserve of water and debris may occur to cause the glof watanabe et al 2009 bolch et al 2011 6 hydrodynamic modeling of glofs keeping in view the recent glof events in the himalayan basins and for planning the water resources projects in the region it is important to design flood and glofs therefore the identification of pdgls in the upstream catchments and glof modeling is very imperative for planning and designing of the water resources projects considering this the present study has been taken up as it provides a methodology for glof modeling useful for the upcoming hydro power projects the mike11 1d hydrodynamic model methodology was adopted for glof modeling mike11 is a professional engineering software package developed by dhi water and environment in 1987 and is used for simulation of one dimensional flow in estuaries rivers irrigation systems channels and other water bodies the software has been successfully used for glof modeling in himalayan basins by various researchers e g jain et al 2012 aggarwal et al 2013 lohani 2015 2016 lohani and jain 2016 thakur et al 2016 in processing it is very user friendly and dynamic modeling tool for the detailed design management and operation of both simple as well as complex channel systems mike11 user manual 2003 the essence of dam break modeling is hydrodynamic modeling which involves finding solutions of two partial differential equations originally derived by barre de saint venant in 1871 sleigh and goodwill 2000 the st venant equations cannot be solved explicitly except by making some assumptions which are unrealistic for most situations therefore numerical techniques have to be used three groups of methods are usually used finite difference finite elements and finite volumes sleigh and goodwill 2000 it is one of the models which use the above methods using finite difference method to compute the water level and discharge values for the cross sections along the river abbott and basco 1989 thakur et al 2016 the river channel is feed as a stream centerline with a buffer zone of 1 km along the river stretch and by a series of cross section profiles at regular intervals created from dems fig 2a b in the model the lakes are represented as dam break structures such as reservoirs with certain crest level and crest length the representation of lakes as a reservoir is achieved by its elevation surface area relation at chainage 0 km of the reservoir branch table 3 the resultant outburst flood peak flow is directly related to lake volume dam height and width dam material composition failure mechanism downstream topography and sediment availability it is notable that the glofs increase to peak flow then gradually or abruptly decrease to normal levels once the water source is exhausted in order to get the maximum glof peak at any location the breaching of moraine dam of lake has to be considered along with channel routing the model assesses the flood hydrograph of discharge from the dam breach and water level discharge time series at different locations of the river downstream of the dam due to propagation of flood waves however it is notable that the difference between the computed discharge and measured discharge can be minimized by modifying the dem derived cross sections and adjusting the values of manning n ramesh et al 2000 the aster dem used in this study has a pre production accuracy of 7 14 m at 95 confidence for vertical data and 30 m at 95 confidence for horizontal data therefore the derived cross section profiles and its width were modified after ge images and applying correction factors as well as taking theoretical water depth river profile as a function of river discharge from the literature julien 2002 cushman roisin 2014 further due to the low spatial resolution 30 m of the dem the generated river network cross sections and banks in few of the upstream cross sections were covered within a single pixel value with same elevation thus the validation of the input layers was first carried out against virtual ge images because of the non availability of field data errors wherever found were edited and corrected in gis platform to further minimize the errors in cross section extraction correction factors were applied after comparing the dem extracted cross sections with the available ground truth data for other places the layers were also edited to adjust for minimum bed elevation wherever downstream cross section elevation was found to be more than upstream elevation this editing was done because most of the dems do not contain full bathymetry information past studies have used the aster gdem successfully in generating the river centerlines cross sections etc with tolerable errors in the himalayan region wang et al 2012a jain et al 2012 thakur et al 2016 the manning s n was adopted from thakur et al 2016 thakur et al 2016 have derived the manning s n according to lulc land use land cover in nearby dhauliganga basin garhwal himalaya subsequently the adjusted cross sections were used in mike11 hd model for the simulation of the river flow at different sections to attain conveyance factor the simulation of dam breach required several input parameters which are classified as 1 lake information i e volume area and depth 2 cross sections from lake to the outlet of the basin these are used to model the channel s topography and routing 3 the dam breach parameters i e initial and final breach width and level time duration of breach development and breach invert level time of failure etc the details of the input parameters for the simulation are given in the table 4 further as the glof modeling carried out in this study is not being performed on the measured flood discharge data to compare the results of the simulations with or calibrate the model therefore the error analysis is not performed but there are several previous studies that have reported a higher accuracy and acceptable application of the model in the himalayas e g jain et al 2012 aggarwal et al 2013 thakur et al 2016 in a recent study thakur et al 2016 based on linear regression 0 954 and nash coefficients 0 94 have reported more than 94 of validation between the observed and simulated water discharge data at joshimath site in a nearby dhauliganga basin located in the western himalayas 7 results and discussion in this study the changes in glaciers and associated lakes were analyzed for different time periods between 1962 and 1975 1976 1990 1991 2000 2001 2005 2006 2009 and 2010 2015 depending upon the availability of the satellite datasets it is notable that the pg and pl are clearly visible on the images of 1989 and 2010 whereas the dg and dl are not clearly visible on these images due to presence of snow cover particularly towards the northern areas therefore the images of 1989 and 2010 were used for the delineation of pg and pl whereas the images of 1990 and 2009 were used for the delineation of dg and dl due to the clear visibility for this time but in order to maintain the consistency in results and to undergo systematic comparative analysis of glacier and lake evolution the 1990 and 2009 years were considered representative and standard years therefore the data derived during 1989 and 2010 for the pg and pl were also represented in terms of the considered standard years this is because the smaller changes if any during a small period of time of one year from 1989 to 1990 and 2009 2010 were supposed to be very insignificant the detailed characteristics of these glaciers are given in table 5 7 1 glacier retreat area and sla changes monitoring changes in the terminal positions of the two selected glaciers for a total time period of 53 years 1962 2015 in the study area shows that the glaciers dg and pg have receded continuously and rapidly fig 4 a b for instance during 1962 the snout of the dg was at an elevation of 4362 m a s l and has retreated to an elevation of 4471 m a s l as observed during 2015 similarly the pg s snout was observed at an elevation of 4479 m a s l which has retreated to an elevation of 4536 m a s l since the snout retreat has a direct bearing on the length of the glaciers an analysis of the length changes was also carried out the length of dg was 7 93 0 74 km during 1962 and has decreased gradually to 6 77 0 11 km during 2015 overall the total retreat of 1240 140 m 15 7 0 17 from 1962 to 2015 at a rate of 23 3 2 6 m a 1 was found for dg fig 5 a previously kamp et al 2011 based on soi maps and satellite data have reported a retreat of 745 m at a rate of 26 6 m a 1 for this glacier between the years from 1975 to 2003 which is in agreement to our results likely the length of pg was observed to be 12 6 1 11 km during 1962 which has gradually decreased to 9 91 0 17 km 2015 for this glacier the total retreat observed was 2690 650 m 21 3 2 44 from 1962 to 2015 at a rate of 50 7 12 2 m a 1 fig 5b for this glacier raj 2010 has studied the retreat from 1975 to 2005 and reported an average retreat rate of 12 m a 1 considering a similar time period from 1975 to 2005 in the present study the total retreat was determined to be 830 230 m at a rate of 27 6 6 4 m a 1 which is two times higher than a retreat of 12 m a 1 this difference in the recession rate was attributed to the variable methodologies adopted in these two studies for example in the present study the average length was calculated from the intersection of stripes with the glacier outlines in terms of its retreat whereas the glacier retreat measurements have been carried out along the maximum length of the glacier in case of raj 2010 however the present observed retreat rates i e 23 3 2 6 and 50 7 12 2 m a 1 fall within the range of the glacier retreat rates of 0 88 m a 1 reported from 1975 1989 1992 to 2001 in this area pandey et al 2011 similarly kamp et al 2011 have also reported recession rates varying between 0 6 and 60 9 m a 1 studied from 1975 to 2003 2006 for selected ten large glaciers of same basin following the continuous recession of the glaciers the area has also decreased considerably from 1962 to 2015 the dg s area was 13 7 0 56 km2 during 1962 which has decreased to 11 0 0 04 km2 2015 overall the dg has shrunk by 2 6 0 56 km2 19 2 4 1 at a rate of 0 05 0 01 km2 a 1 during the last 53 years period fig 5a similarly the area of pg has decreased considerably from 26 7 0 65 km2 during 1962 to 23 3 0 04 km2 during 2015 the pg has decreased by 3 4 0 65 km2 21 7 2 4 from 1962 to 2015 at a rate of 0 06 0 004 km2 a 1 fig 5b overall the dg and pg revealed a higher and continuous trend in glacier retreat and areal loss from 1962 to 2015 with a slight decline after 2005 during the time from 1962 1975 to 2000 the glaciers exhibited higher loss these results are more or less comparable to earlier studies in this area and elsewhere which suggest that the decade after 1990s experienced greater glacier wastage and retreat bolch et al 2008a b ren et al 2006 pandey et al 2011 the higher glacier loss during 1990s may be linked to a relative increase in annual mean temperature ren et al 2006 moreover a comparison of changes between these two selected glaciers revealed a heterogeneous pattern of retreat and areal loss for instance the dg showed a retreat rate of 23 3 2 6 m a 1 15 7 0 17 which is relatively small than a retreat rate of 50 7 12 2 m a 1 21 3 2 44 of pg table 6 the heterogeneous pattern of glacier shrinkage and retreat shown by these glaciers dg and pg is attributed to the difference in aspect altitude local climate and other topographic factors as these glaciers are located in widely separated sub basins of the zanskar basin as a result of continuous retreat of these glaciers proglacial lakes have developed at the termini of them therefore the higher retreat of these two glaciers may be attributed to the presence of these moraine dammed proglacial lakes particularly the higher retreat rate of the pg can be attributed to the presence of its moraine dammed lake and relatively steep gradient of its mother glacier s tongue in the zanskar sub basin previous studies have reported an average rate of retreat of 20 m a 1 mostly for the glaciers without proglacial lakes kamp et al 2011 kulkarni et al 2011 the average retreat rate of 20 m a 1 is comparatively lower than the retreat results of the present glaciers in addition the higher area loss of 19 24 4 1 and lower retreat of 15 7 0 17 23 3 2 6 m a 1 of dg as compared to the lower area loss of 12 71 2 4 and higher retreat of 21 3 2 44 50 7 12 2 m a 1 of pg is probably due to the variable topographic configuration and length width ratio of the glaciers which controls the area and length changes mir et al 2017 for example the greater width of the frontal part of the dg terminus yields a higher areal loss with lower terminus recession the change in length also depends on various factors such as bed slope and length of the glacier and its response time etc it is commonly seen that the flat bedded glaciers e g dg show large area change due to vertical thinning with marginal frontal recession conversely steep slope at the glacier front will lead to excessive frontal recession e g pg the higher and heterogeneous pattern of glacier shrinkage and retreat shown by these glaciers dg and pg is in the line of past studies carried out in this area for example nathawat et al 2008 reported that glaciers have lost 18 of area and retreated by 6 33 m a 1 from 1962 to 2001 in parts of the zanskar valley a recent study on five large glaciers of the zanskar basin reported an area loss of 13 15 at a retreat rate of 8 19 m a 1 of clean glaciers and 14 21 of area loss at a retreat rate of 2 3 m a 1 of debris covered glaciers shukla and qadir 2016 similarly pandey et al 2011 reported a heterogeneous pattern of glacier shrinkage in this area for example they reported a glacier area loss of 1 5 and a retreat of 3 42 m a 1 from 1975 to 1989 1992 followed by an area loss of 4 and a glacier retreat of 0 88 m a 1 from 1989 1992 to 2001 they further reported that the change in glacier area was 3 for 23 glaciers and 2 for 7 glaciers and the glacier retreat was 0 80 m a 1 from 2001 to 2007 rai et al 2013 have reported a glacier area loss of 19 9 1 85 km2 a 1 from 1962 to 2001 in the doda valley of zanskar basin in contrast kulkarni et al 2011 have reported an area loss of 9 2 2 41 km2 a 1 from 1962 to 2001 in the zanskar basin similarly schmidt and nüsser 2009 have reported an area loss of 13 3 0 34 km2 a 1 from 1969 to 2010 in the kang yatze massif zanskar basin kamp et al 2011 also reported a general trend of glacier recession from 1975 to 2008 in the zanskar himalaya mir and majeed 2016 have reported a small retreat and areal loss of parkachik glacier located in close proximity to dg in the suru sub basin of this area they reported a total retreat of 127 0 09 m at a rate of 2 9 0 004 m a 1 and an area loss of 740 0 7 m2 1 5 0 09 at a rate of 74 0 7 m2 a 1 of the parkachik glacier from 1971 to 2015 thus from the above discussion it is clear that the glaciers in the zanskar basin are retreating and losing area at heterogeneous rates which probably depends upon the aspects altitude hypsometry the characteristics and thickness of supraglacial debris cover on the glacier surface characteristics of supraglacial and proglacial lakes topographic configuration and length width ratio of glacier tongue ablation zone the local climatic system the glacier size and accumulation area ratio etc as reported by previous studies the continuous recession of the zanskar basin glaciers is most likely caused by the combined effect of warmer temperatures and reduced precipitation ren et al 2006 kamp et al 2011 shukla and qadir 2016 mir and majeed 2016 in a recent study in this region it has been reported that the climate is warming and precipitation is reducing from the last few decades chevuturi et al 2016 this observation is also supported by analyzing the changes in the sla ela in this study ohmura et al 1992 lie et al 2003 shukla and qadir 2016 for example an analysis of the mean sla ela of the dg revealed that it has risen from 4807 m a s l 1975 to 5080 m a s l 2015 as shown in fig 5c the sla ela estimation for the dg was carried out for 1975 1990 2000 2005 2009 and 2015 years similarly the sla ela of the pg monitored for 1975 1990 2000 and 2015 years have gone up from 4920 m a s l 1976 to 5210 m a s l 2015 the results reveal that the present glaciers have experienced a steady increase in sla ela values from 1975 to 2000 but little variability from 2000 to 2015 however an overall increasing trend of sla ela is evident fig 5c further between the dg and pg the specific sla ela values are generally increasing but the temporal variability differs likely due to several environmental factors such as local temperature precipitation hypsometry humidity and differential shading mcfadden et al 2011 guo et al 2014 thus it appears that a general rise in sla ela may be attributed to regional climatic warming while individual sla ela variation may be related to the topographic factors these results are similar to a recent study carried out by shukla and qadir 2016 who have reported an overall increasing trend of sla for certain selected glaciers of the same basin that is ascribed to the rise in temperature and decline in precipitation 7 2 lake formation and expansion appearance of glacial lakes on the himalayan glaciers is a recent development that is linked to the overall glacier recession and negative mass balance of glaciers kääb et al 2012 gardelle et al 2013 neckel et al 2014 however in this study the presence of proglacial lakes i e dl and pl associated with dg and pg before 1990 1975 is not well documented due to the non availability of the appropriate data and especially doubtful demarcation of lakes on the soi maps of 1962 but it can be inferred that due to the continuous and rapid glacier recession of the dg at a rate of 23 3 2 6 m a 1 from 1962 a proglacial lake has developed at its snout after then the area has continuously expanded during different time periods from 1990 to 2015 for instance the lake area was observed to be 0 20 0 004 km2 during 1990 which has increased gradually to 0 48 0 009 km2 in 2015 overall the area of dl has increased by 0 28 0 005 km2 140 10 from 1990 to 2015 at a rate 0 011 0 0002 km2 a 1 fig 5a 6a similarly after the formation of pl its area was observed to be 0 17 0 007 km2 in 1975 that has increased to 0 58 0 01 km2 in 2015 overall the area of pl has increased by 0 41 0 008 km2 241 1 17 from 1975 to 2015 at a rate 0 010 0 0003 km2 a 1 figs 5b 6b like heterogeneous loss of mother glaciers the expansion of its associated lakes also showed a heterogeneous pattern for instance the dl showed a higher expansion from 1990 to 2000 0 20 0 004 km2 whereas the pl showed a higher expansion of 0 15 0 003 km2 from 1975 to 1990 table 6 similar results have been reported by earlier studies during recent decades the glacial lakes have greatly expanded in high regions of asia characterizing the outstanding regional differences in lake area change which are indicative of inhomogeneous climate warming for example the lake area increased at average rate of 0 8 1 0 a 1 in the himalayas qinghai tibetan plateau in china and tian shan mountains 20 60 in the eastern himalayas and 17 in the middle himalayas of hkh region generally due to climate warming wang et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 based on the expansion studies of lakes in the central himalayan region about 67 glacial lakes have been identified as rapidly expanding lakes nie et al 2013 in general an expanding lake is considered to have an imbalanced water budget where the glacial meltwater and precipitation inputs outbalances evaporation or discharge outputs thus the temperature precipitation and evaporation are considered the common climatic factors that control the glacial lakes changes there are several past studies that have attributed the rapid expansion of glacial lakes to the climate warming and increasing glacier melt precipitation increase and evaporation decrease bolch et al 2012 wang et al 2013 the formation and rapid expansion of ice contact lakes is a more direct signal of temperature rise resulting in increase of glacier melt jain and mir 2017 the conversion of form of precipitation from solid to liquid due to the rising temperature a common phenomenon observed in the western himalayan region mir et al 2015a b 2017 may also be a major factor of rapid lake expansion as a result of higher glacier thinning and wastage however an analysis of the glacial lake expansion in this study showed that the continuous and rapid recession rates of dg and pg may in turn be linked to the development and enlargement of these proglacial lakes at their snouts that is the higher and rapid recession of dg and pg is due to the rapid disintegration wasting of glacier ice front through ice calving activity at the termini besides other factors probably in response to the climate change and warming pattern in the area chevuturi et al 2016 this observation is further supported by the presence of crevasses and cracks on the present studied glaciers ablation zones termini there are many field based measurements and or glacial hydrological modeling studies which have indicated that the development of moraine dammed glacial lakes might be largely related to glacier retreat and down wasting calving of ice yamada and sharma 1993 richardson and reynolds 2000a quincey et al 2007 conversely the ice calving into the lake could have been the key mechanism for the faster and up glacier growth of the lakes after its formation otherwise downward expansion of lakes would have also been large in the present case the terminus disintegration might be higher due to the debris free nature of the glacier ablation areas it is reported that the glacier contact proglacial lakes expand upstream by promoting calving and subaerial melting at the debris free glacier terminus gardelle et al 2011 this is because the proglacial lakes have a marked impact on glacier dynamics as they modify the stress regime of the glacier ice in contact basnett et al 2013 mir and majeed 2016 the presence of proglacial lakes also transmits thermal energy to the ice front accelerating melting calving which leads to enhanced glacier retreat komori 2008 sakai 2012 basnett et al 2013 mir and majeed 2016 additionally the observed upstream lake expansion of the present debris free glaciers is a phenomenon similarly observed in most other proglacial lakes in contact with debris covered glaciers song et al 2016 past studies have also reported that the glacier fed lakes expand rapidly for example in the poiqu river basin glacier fed lakes expanded significantly by 122 1 from 1976 to 2010 whereas non glacier fed lakes remained stable 2 8 this contrast in glacial lake growth is because the glacier fed lakes are influenced by glacial retreat and melting e g subaerial melting water line melting and ice calving gardelle et al 2011 as compared to the non glacier fed lakes thus with retreat and melting of mother glaciers glacier fed lakes will receive a larger area to expand which typically results in lake expansion the contrasting patterns of glacier fed lakes and non glacier fed lakes verify the importance of glacial retreat with regard to lake expansion on a regional scale 7 3 susceptibility of glof hazards from dalung and padam lakes in this study using the remote sensing data in conjunction with high resolution virtual ge images 5m conditions of the glaciers associated lakes and their surroundings have been investigated in detail based on integrated criteria of standard and essential indices table 2 the following facts regarding the future development and the danger of existing lakes were drawn after analysis both the lakes were found moraine dammed having areas more than a threshold value of 0 10 km2 with a volume of more than 10 million m3 considered in this study previously the minimum magnitude of 0 1 km2 has been taken by several studies as the threshold for the analysis of glof events for example a similar threshold has been taken in chinese himalaya lv 1999 wang et al 2012a b tien shan mountains etc wang et al 2013 additionally the area of the present lakes is also higher than a threshold value of 0 2 km2 which possess a potential danger suggested some researchers mool et al 2001 che et al 2004 in general the larger lakes are considered more hazardous than smaller lakes as the lakes with larger areas are generally deeper and may exert higher hydrostatic pressures over the dams making them more susceptible to failure richardson and reynolds 2000b the larger lakes have also a greater surface area potentially exposed to more mass movement and ice avalanche impacts it is also notable that the dynamics of the parent glaciers are directly associated with glof occurrence and the distance between the lake and parent glacier is the most direct measure of the degree of their linkage in the chinese himalaya a horizontal distances of less than 500 m between the lake and parent glacier has been reported for all the recorded glof events lv 1999 however the presently selected lakes are located at the snout connected with mother glaciers and therefore can be affected directly by the dynamics of the parent glaciers such as ice calving activity and the sudden floating of the dead ice during the last three decades a continuous glacier recession has resulted in a progressive growth and expansion of the lake areas e g 20 3 4 expansion of dl and 58 4 5 of pl the lakes have attained a continuous and rapid up glacier growth which was examined by using overlaying of the lake outlines of different time periods the lakes have also witnessed down glacier growth large amount in case of pl than the dl which was however very little and hence considered insignificant fig 6 a b the expanding lakes are considered the more hazardous than the lakes which remain stable or shrink the examples of minor moraine dammed lake area reduction that are not related to glofs have been observed in patagonia loriaux and casassa 2013 the slope of glaciers termini and lake outlets is higher than a threshold value of 7 and 10 in both cases there is also a steep gradient of the emerging stream from the lakes a small distance to the outlet of the basin main river and settlement areas previously it has been reported that the high dams which produce outbursts with high peak discharges usually have steep outlets walder and o connor 1997 similarly the other indices such as glacier areas slope between the mother glaciers and lakes top width of the moraine dams are higher than the defined criteria see table 2 thereby suggesting that the lakes are potentially dangerous since the first appearance of these lakes the growth rate is almost rapid and continuous and it is very likely that the lakes will continue to grow this is because 1 the proglacial lakes have a marked impact on glacier dynamics as they tend to modify the stress regime of the glacier ice in contact basnett et al 2013 and increase the terminus disintegration by the process of calving and accelerating melting komori 2008 sakai 2012 basnett et al 2013 mir and majeed 2016 moreover 2 the debris free ablation zones of these glaciers have a gentle slope i e 10 15 for a considerable length of 1 km which may provide favorable conditions to further accelerate the glacier retreat and up glacier lake growth the glaciers with a low angle terminus are the indicators of negative mass balance consequently the lakes in contact with moderately flat glacier fronts are likely to grow as a consequence of glacier retreat frey et al 2010 thus the continuous glacier ice melting will produce a large volume of water thereby increasing the hydrostatic pressure against the moraine dams which consist mostly of unconsolidated loose poorly sorted sediments and granular glacial deposits which are highly susceptible to failure in the himalayan region the glacial lakes are commonly dammed by the moraines which are normally unstable due to the unconsolidated composition jain et al 2012 agarwal et al 2013 however it is important to mention that the presence of any channels may relatively help in draining the excess melt water and reduce the increasing water level hydrostatic pressure for example there are narrow spillways channels present in case of moraine dams of the present lakes in case of dl the channel has a width of about 5 m whereas in case of pl the channel is comparatively wider having a width of about 15 m however the influence of these channels on drainage of surplus water that might have been produced during last decades as a result of observed rapid glacier recession seems to be insignificant this is because the lakes have indicated a rapid and continuous expansion from 1970s reflecting an increase in the area and probably the volume hydrostatic pressure of the melt water however to elaborately understand this phenomenon water level change studies of these lakes should be carried out in the future moreover the creation of icebergs due to the ice calving activity or floating of dead ice at the glacier termini of these glaciers can t be ignored the floating icebergs are clearly identifiable on ge images especially in case of dl the icebergs can cause blockade of the channels and raise the water level potentially overtopping and breaching the dam there is also a high probability of blockade of these channels due to the debris fall flow from the surrounding high elevated side slopes and adjacent tributary glacier valleys especially during the periods of high intensity precipitation bookhagen et al 2005 presently large deposits of debris are also present mainly in the form of alluvial fans scree deposits adjacent to these lakes occurrence of intense and frequent extreme precipitation events like cloudbursts due to climate change dash et al 2007 nandargi and dhar 2011 is the most probable factor for dam failure overall in the ladakh region occurrences of six flood events due to cloud bursts in a short span of six years since 2005 have been reported recently thayyen et al 2013 as reported the cloud bursts have triggered a devastating debris flow landsliding in this region hobley et al 2012 in the indian himalayan region flash flooding glofs landslides etc resulting from sudden downpours due to cloudbursts is very common in the monsoonal season raj 2010 dimri et al 2016 thayyen et al 2013 most importantly for the development of pdgls the down wasting of the glacier tongues is an essential factor among the recorded glof events in the himalayas the north american cordillera and the tropical andes slope movements such as ice avalanches rockfall and landslides have been found to be the most frequent glof triggers clague and evans 2000 richardson and reynolds 2000a b emmer and cochachin 2013 however the likelihood of an ice avalanche impacting a lake depends on the distance slope and roughness of the terrain between the glacier and the lake therefore to locate the site of ice calving and avalanches in these areas a detailed study of the glacier morphology and topography of the surroundings have been taken into account first the longitudinal profiles a b were generated starting from the lower end of the moraine dams to the head walls of the glaciers fig 7 a b the calculated longitudinal profiles shed light on the possible sites of ice calving upslope of the lakes for instance a convex area with a steep gradient is present at a distance of 1 5 km slope 45 above dl and 1 25 km slope 25 above pl that might cause ice detachment wasting or sliding into the lakes in the coming years this observation is further supported by the presence of a dense network of transverse crevasses cracks at the steep part of the ablation zones of the glaciers fig 8 a b the presence of transverse crevasses may facilitate the rapid ice detachment by facilitating higher penetration of the glacier meltwater or rainfall produced as a result of climate change the penetration of the water into the glacier may affect the glacier movement by influencing the stress distribution at the glacier bed and thereby the rate at which the ice slides over the bed however presently the large ices avalanche calving at the glaciers termini is unlikely to occur because of the gentle slope and low elevation of the ice front but due to the continuous and progressive glacier retreat the successive lake growth and expansion is certain to increase and to reach the steep site of ice avalanche zone secondly the presence of steeper surroundings around the lakes particularly towards right side can be a probable source of mass movement i e rockfall or slide fig 8a b the steep unvegetated slopes are a common source of mass movements peduzzi 2010 large and high velocity mass movement landslides can generate impulse waves of hundreds of meters of run up that can easily over top dams starting progressive erosion and lake drainage walder et al 2003 to analyze these factors both the study areas were divided into five slope classes using the aster dem after the classification of reynolds 2000 as shown in fig 9 a b the slopes steeper particularly more than 45 are considered the dangerous and probable source areas for mass movements alean 1985 bolch et al 2011 as found the gradient of the slopes surrounding the lakes is very steep at most of the areas particularly towards the south of the dl and south west of pl also see fig 8a b the mass movements of ice and rock are the most common trigger of recorded glof events in the himalayas as well richardson and reynolds 2000 and the frequency of such triggering may be directly influenced by warming of the climate system deline et al 2014 mass movement impacts have been related to outburst floods in patagonia and other andean regions hubbard et al 2005 harrison et al 2006 however in the himalayas the cause of the outbursts has been reported mostly by the ice avalanches on the mother glacier tongues by analyzing earlier glofs ding and liu 1992 lv 1999 furthermore the characteristics of the moraines and the freeboard were manually addressed based on the aster dem the freeboard was observed to be low 10 m limited freeboard between the crest of the moraine dam and the lake level facilitate the waves to overtop the moraine dam reynolds 2003 there is also a large difference between the elevation at which the lakes are present and confluence point where the stream emerging from the lakes join the main rivers for instance the pl and dl are located approximately at an elevation of 4500 m and 4350 m a s l whereas the confluence points are located at an elevation of 3750 m and 4050 m a s l respectively in addition the relative height between the lake water levels and base levels of the terminal moraine dams is 4373 and 4348 m a s l i e 25 m dl and 4496 m and 4476 m i e 20 m pl that is similar to widely known imja tsho 20 m which is regarded as one of the important pdgl in the nepal himalayas icimod 2011 the climate is one of the important factors as regards to creation and stability of moraine dams hansel 2003 the failures of moraine dams is becoming increasingly frequent due to global warming and have occurred in the himalayas european alps north american rockies andes tien shan mountains and pamirs reynolds 2000 nevertheless the frequency and magnitude of moraine dam failures and glofs will continue to increase with the current and continued scenario of rising temperatures and increased variability of precipitation rgsl 2003 bajracharya et al 2006 the intensity of glofs risk is also at rise due to the risk of a rockfall or an avalanche due to tectonically active zone in this region bilham et al 2011 have postulated an occurrence of m 9 0 earthquake and have estimated a 13 17 mm convergence rate and inferred a locked zone of 200 km width extending from zanskar range to peshawar basin in kohistan range the tectonically active areas and presence of active faults fault zones close to an area that contains moraine dammed lakes is at an elevated risk of experiencing earthquake induced glofs due to the earth quakes if any large and high velocity landslides possess a greater threat for the dam failure in this area thus based on the above discussed factors the pl and dl are suggested potentially dangerous and susceptible to an outburst floods 7 4 comparison of the adopted criteria with other studies assessing the susceptibility of glacial lakes to outburst floods as mentioned earlier a number of methods can be used for the assessment of susceptibility of the glacial lakes to outburst floods however these methods vary considerably based on the parameters considered number and selection of assessed characteristics the level of importance placed upon each parameter the amount and type of required input data and their levels of objectivity emmer and vilímek 2013 it is also notable that the use of various approaches can also lead to different classifications of the hazard associated with an individual glacial lake for instance the imja tsho and chamlang south tsho located in the nepal region have been classified differently by different classifications richardson and reynolds 2000a examined the processes of formation and development of potentially hazardous glacial lakes in the himalayas and discussed briefly technical and implementation issues associated with hazard assessment and mitigation considering these facts in the present study the maximum number of criterion indicators about 16 indicators as found in literature have been used remote sensing data have been used to derive these indicators to analyze and classify the lakes as pdgls a standard approach was adopted based on glacier dynamics glacial lake dynamics dam characteristics and down valley status topographic features around the lakes and glaciers and thresholds for indicating pdgls previously worni et al 2013 have classified both the lakes as critically potential based on the condition of the dam similarly raj 2010 also classified the padam lake as dangerous additionally wang et al 2012a b based on almost similar criteria identified about 142 pdmdls in the chinese himalaya another study by khanal et al 2015 have identified 10 pdgls poiqu bhotekoshi sun koshi river basin in the central himalayas jha and khare 2017 have identified 2 pdgls using similar approach in dhauliganga basin garhwal himalaya aggarwal et al 2013 have reported 18 pdgls in the teesta basin sikkim himalaya using the similar approach in general the adopted approach can be used for the glof risk assessment in a time and cost effective manner through the application of remote sensing with or without in situ surveys in combination with other tools 7 5 glof simulation and risk assessment in the present study an integrated criteria based on 16 indices frequently used by the researchers indicated that the selected glacial lakes are potentially dangerous for example the lake area changes reflected the state of hydric balance of the lakes the rapid glacier retreat and subsequent changes in the lake areas may disturb the hydric balance thus promoting moraine dammed lake outbursts therefore taking into account the availability of data obtained from remote sensing not including fieldwork the glacial lake outburst flood modeling was carried out the breaching and failure of the moraine dams was considered due to the overtopping and increased hydrostatic pressure against the moraine dams as a result of increased glacier melt resulting due to rapid glacier shrinkage wastage the over topping of the lakes may result due to waves generated by the rockfall ice avalanche into the lakes considering this an attempt has been made to generate the flood hydrographs and to model semi quantitatively the glofs at the lake and downstream sites using one dimensional mike 11 model as mentioned the dl is located in a tributary catchment of suru river and therefore the dam breach flood i e glof has been routed through the suru river for a total length of 35 km from the lake up to a major village where another major tributary confluences with it the river profile has been represented in the model as a stream line with a number of cross sections considering a breach width of 60 and 25 m the flood hydrographs at the lake site and at the downstream outlet site has been generation fig 10 a the simulation revealed a total flood peak due to glof at the lake site of 3361 7 m3 s 1 same flood peak gets mitigated to 1520 9 m3 s 1 at the outlet the time of travel of flood peak from the lake site to outlet is about 1 h and 42 min there is almost a half attenuation of the flood wave magnitude between the lake site and the outlet site table 7 similarly the pl is located in a tributary catchment of tsarap basin and therefore dam breach flood i e glof has been routed first through tributary stream followed by main tsarap river up to its confluence with the stod river at padam town the stod and tsarap rivers after confluence give rise to the zanskar river the river profile from pl site down to the catchment outlet has a total length of 50 km in this case simulations have been carried out for a breach width of 67 and 27 m the flood hydrographs produced at the lake site revealed a glof peak of 4210 3 m3 s 1 same flood peak gets mitigated to 1722 4 m3 s 1 at the outlet fig 10b the time of travel of flood peak from the lake site to the outlet was estimated to be about 1 h and 40 min for pl there is almost a one third attenuation of the flood wave magnitude between the lake site and the outlet site table 7 from these results it is inferred that the high glof peak discharge downstream at a distance of 50 km has a higher potential for hazard in case of pl failure nevertheless the minimum travel distance 35 km to catchment outlet and steep slope in case dl can also cause a worse scenario of glof past studies have reported an enormous glof event from dig tsho nepal in 1985 bajracharya and mool 2009 that resulted in a flood wave of 600 2000 m3 s 1 viuchard and zimmerman 1987 with enormous consequences noticeable even 90 km below the dammed lake richardson and reynolds 2000a in addition the modeled results of flood hydrographs of the present study lakes are more or less similar to the past studies for instance agarwal et al 2013 using the same mike 11 one dimensional model have estimated almost a similar flood hydrograph of 2611 136 m3 s 1 at lake site and 1417 844 m3 s 1 at the outlet site in tista basin skim himalaya similarly thakur et al 2016 estimated a similar flood discharge peak of 1394 28 1552 04 and 1898 04 m3 s 1 for a breach width of 40 60 and 80 m at the downstream sites in the dhauliganga river of alaknanda basin western himalaya however raj 2010 used empirical formulas and estimated a peak discharge varying from 1 7 196 m3 s 1 for the padam lake that is however significantly lower than the presently modeled peak discharge additionally the past studies have reported peak discharges of 2500 3600 m3 s 1 in case of glof from glacial lake lc2 in patagonia chile jacquet et al 2017 2500 m3 s 1 of luggye tsho in bhutan richardson and reynolds 2000a 4500 m3 s 1 of gelhaipuco lake in china chen et al 2013 3690 m3 s 1 of qubixiama cho lake in china ligg 1988 the glof can attain a peak discharge of 30 000 m3 s 1 and travel a distance of 200 km richardson and reynolds 2000a however it is notable that the magnitude of risk associated with outburst floods depend upon the downstream density of settlements and infrastructures in case of high population density and costly infrastructure high fatalities and damage could be inflicted by even small outburst floods the dalung and padam valleys are almost uninhabited downstream for approximately 10 km from dl and about 20 km from pl however many people from farther downstream commute and also install temporary huts within a major part of the suru and tsarap river valleys through which the glofs have been routed during the summer season april october for grazing their yaks sheep and goats there is also frequent inflow of tourists into these areas during summers in addition a major padam town district leh is located in the tsarap river valley which consist a few hundred households and thousands of people their property livestock crops and agricultural land along with several bridges irrigation canals and military camps in the flood routed prone areas rizvi 1996 schettler et al 1981 in this town there are other several government administrative units a post office internet cafes and telephone booths a number of notable buddhist monasteries such as bardan monasteryandkursha monastery in addition there are also several hotels home stays restaurants and tea shops meant for tourists rizvi 1996 osada et al 2000 similarly the downstream areas of the suru valley is inhabited by 25 000 people rizvi 1996 near therangdum village there is the famous rangdum monasterybelonging to thegelugpasect of tibetan buddhism and a summer tent camp meant for tourists however there is limited number of other facilities for visitors in this valley but the lower areas of this valley are considered one of the most agriculturally productive parts of ladakh region with the cultivation two crops a year schettler et al 1981 rizvi 1996 in this study the critical information needed to assess glof hazards have been achieved through a detailed study of glacier recession and associated lake formation and its expansion topography around the lakes and glof modeling this study integrated remote sensing and high resolution gei and one dimensional flood modeling studies which have not been achieved previously in spite of the assumptions and limitations as outlined below the adopted approach for indicating pdgls and hydrodynamic modeling is found to be good enough as it provides reasonable estimate of glofs thus enabling the appropriate estimation of flood design however future research pertaining to the calculations of size of potential displacement waves estimation of volume of ice or rockfall that may detach from the glaciers or steep mountain slopes water level changes of the lakes and a detailed field survey to assess the risk in the downstream areas for the more reliable evaluation of these pdgls is suggested limitations of the approach applied in this study 1 a number of remotely sensed images can be used to observe the changes in glacial lakes and expansion mechanisms for monitoring purposes however relying only on remote sensing data is inadequate as it cannot provide the necessary bathymetric information changes in the height of the damming moraine and other moraine dam properties such as the presence of bedrock ice and pipes or changes in lake level cui et al 2003 which are also important additionally the geometry parameters of the dam and parent glaciers as derived from aster gdem may include inaccuracies frey et al 2010 fujita et al 2008 therefore high resolution satellite images such as spot5 2 5 m resolution in the panchromatic band and ikonos 1 m resolution in the panchromatic band images may provide alternative data for the analysis 2 the studied pdgls are located at higher elevations 4300 m in the himalayas where permafrost are normally developed the interactions and chain reactions of permafrost thaw in a lake basin due to atmospheric warming will also possibly reduce the stability of the moraine dam however due to the absence of suitable data e g multi temporal optical or sar data and the limitations of remote sensing based studies it was difficult to obtain the physical characteristics of permafrost and the stability of the moraine dam and other permafrost related activities in the present work 3 glacial lake outburst flood modeling process is an approximation of a physical phenomenon through which the physical phenomenon and its effects are studied for water resources structure design and flood management in glof modeling assumptions were mainly associated with the breach parameters especially breach width and breach depth which may have impact on flood peak and arrival times 8 conclusions the present study has been carried out to study the glacier recession glacier surface area changes glacial lake expansion and topography around lakes to determine the lake s development and dynamic processes and to assess the prospect of glofs using multi temporal satellite data and one dimensional breach modeling over a period of last five decades the area of dg and pg has respectively shrunk by 2 64 0 56 km2 19 2 4 1 at a rate of 0 05 0 01 km2 a 1 and 3 4 0 65 km2 12 71 2 4 at a rate of 0 06 0 01 km2 a 1 from 1962 to 2015 during the same time period the dg retreated by 1240 140 m 15 7 0 17 at a rate of 23 3 0 m a 1 whereas the pg has retreat by 2690 210 m 21 3 1 67 at a rate of 50 7 4 0 m a 1 the sla ela has risen from 4807 m to 5080 m a s l in case of dg whereas it has gone up from 4920 m to 5210 m a s l in case of pg from 1975 to 2015 the glacier recession and areal changes were found to be rapid and continuous during the studied period as a consequence of glacier recession proglacial lakes dammed by moraine deposits have appeared after 1962 and have expanded continuously up slope from 1970 s the area of dl has expanded by 0 32 0 03 km2 0 20 0 004 0 48 0 009 km2 from 1990 to 2015 whereas the pl area has expanded by 0 41 0 008 km2 0 17 0 007 0 58 0 01 km2 from 1975 to 2015 moreover the present glaciers have an extensive possibility of further upslope recession due to the presence of gentle gradient 15 up to a distance of 1 km and debris free ablation zones in the future consequently the associated lakes have also a wide possibility of expansion associated with glacier recession based on an integrated criterion of standard indices as used in this study the lakes were indicated as potentially dangerous the terminal moraine dams consisting unconsolidated composition and the pronounced altitude difference between the lake and the base of the moraine dam the dams are highly susceptible to failure the steep slopes around the lakes and steep gradient 30 in the glacier ablation zones are considered potential sites for mass movements trigging an outburst flood thus using the one dimensional mike 11 model the flood hydrographs were generated with a peak discharge of 3361 7 m3 a 1 and 4210 3 m3 a 1 at lake sites of dl and pl the flood peak of dl gets mitigated to 1520 9 m3 a 1 and that of pl gets mitigated to 1722 4 m3 a 1at the outlet sites the high glof peak discharge of pl downstream at a distance of 50 km has a higher potential for hazards whereas the minimum travel distance of dl 35 km to the catchment outlet and its steep slope can cause a

7076,an empirical geo statistical modelling scheme is developed to address the challenges of modelling the severity and distribution of groundwater droughts given their spatially and temporally heterogeneous nature and given typically highly irregular groundwater level observations in space and time the scheme is tested using gwl measurements from 948 observation boreholes across the chalk aquifer uk to estimate monthly groundwater drought status from 1960 to 2013 for each borehole monthly gwls are simulated using empirical mixed models where the fixed effects are based on applying an impulse response function to the local monthly precipitation modelled gwls are standardised using the standardised groundwater index sgi and the monthly sgi values interpolated across the aquifer to produce spatially distributed monthly maps of sgi drought status for 54 years for the chalk the mixed models include fewer parameters than comparable lumped parameter groundwater models while explaining a similar proportion more than 65 of gwl variation in addition the empirical modelling approach enables confidence bounds on the predicted gwls and sgi values to be estimated without the need for prior information about catchment or aquifer parameters the results of the modelling scheme are illustrated for three major episodes of multi annual drought 1975 1976 1988 1992 2011 2012 they agree with previous documented analyses of the groundwater droughts while providing for the first time a systematic spatially coherent characterisation of the events the scheme is amenable to use in near real time to provide short term forecasts of groundwater drought status if suitable forecasts of the driving meteorology are available keywords groundwater drought standardised groundwater level

below normal groundwater level or reduced spring discharge tallaksen and van lanen 2004 mishra and singh 2010 van loon 2015 it is a natural hazard that can have a wide range of often profound social economic and environmental impacts shahid and hazarika 2010 hughes et al 2012 van dijk et al 2013 medellin azuara et al 2015 including reductions in deployable output from boreholes potentially leading to costly restrictions to public supply reduced abstractions for agriculture and industry and reduction in groundwater discharge to groundwater supported rivers and wetlands which can cause ecological stress and lead to loss of amenity value lange et al 2017 consequently there is a need to assess the severity and distribution of groundwater droughts to improve groundwater drought warnings to contribute to improved water resource decision making during episodes of drought and to improve longer term drought and water resources management plans van lanen et al 2016 however assessment of the severity and distribution of groundwater droughts is challenging due to a combination of issues primarily related to the availability and nature of groundwater level gwl data bachmair et al 2016 van loon et al 2017 and because groundwater droughts are commonly spatially and temporally heterogeneous in character peters et al 2006 mendicino et al 2008 tallaksen et al 2009 bloomfield et al 2015 although there is increasing use of telemetry gwls are still often measured at relatively low frequencies on the order of days to months or seasons depending on the purpose of the groundwater monitoring li et al 2015 in addition gwl data are often temporally irregular and may contain artefacts as a result the availability of suitable gwl data at timescales relevant to the systematic assessment of droughts is often limited van loon et al 2017 hydrological droughts propagate from a spatially and temporally heterogeneous meteorological signal precipitation deficit through soils soil moisture deficit and via reduced recharge lead to reduced groundwater levels peters et al 2003 the spatio temporal characteristics of the drought signal changes as it passes through the terrestrial water cycle so that groundwater droughts are typically lagged and attenuated compared with meteorological droughts van loon 2015 there are many catchment and aquifer related factors that influence these changes in drought signal and that can affect the eventual spatio temporal expression of groundwater droughts including the nature of land cover and the thickness and hydraulic characteristics of the soil and unsaturated zone that influence recharge the hydraulic properties of the saturated zone and the location and hydraulic characteristics of major groundwater discharge areas tallaksen et al 2009 bloomfield et al 2015 this paper describes the first modelling method to take account of both the irregular and uncertain nature of groundwater level data and the spatial and temporally varying nature of droughts as they propagate through the terrestrial water cycle to estimate the monthly status of groundwater droughts including confidence bands on those estimates the novel modelling scheme is tested with a large gwl data set from the cretaceous chalk limestone the main aquifer in the united kingdom the results of the modelling are illustrated with the analysis of three major episodes of multi annual drought across the chalk 1995 1996 1988 1992 and 2011 2012 and it is shown that they provide a high level of detail with regard to spatio temparal variability of individual episodes of groundwater drought across the study area finally the underlying causes of heterogeneity in the modelled gwls and droughts are discussed as are the wider applications of the modelling scheme for groundwater drought and groundwater resource assessments 2 modelling context a range of methods have previously been used to model groundwater drought status including simple graphical representations of groundwater levels for example of ranked historic records the use of proxies of groundwater drought status primarily to address issues related to the lack of suitable gwl data process based distributed groundwater models and more recently the use of multiple site specific empirical and lumped parameter models estimating groundwater drought status across a region can be as simple as relating recent observations of gwls to historic data for a given site for example by rank or percentile marsh et al 2013 natural environment research council 2017 usgs 2017 however such approaches rarely reveal sufficient detail of heterogeneity within episodes of groundwater drought to help with management responses van loon et al 2017 bachmair et al 2016 note in a recent survey of drought monitoring that there is a lack of widespread monitoring of groundwater drought and that the scarcity of water status observations especially for groundwater reflects the common focus on drought seen through the lens of rainfall and soil moisture that can be easily remotely monitored and or modelled in this context attempts have been made to overcome the common limitations of gwl data for drought status assessments by modelling gwl data with other more spatially extensive and or higher frequency and or more temporally regular hydrometric data such as remotely sensed data including for example data from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace tapley et al 2004 the modelled gwl data can then be used as proxies for groundwater drought status and hence used to obtain more detailed spatio temporal descriptions of episodes of groundwater drought however remotely sensed data products can have low spatial resolution e g 400 km grid squares for grace and the use of remotely sensed data can be particularly sensitive to model parameterisation such as depth to water table and depth to bedrock and hence to spatial variations in often uncertain catchment properties e g li and rodell 2015 another approach to assess and analyse groundwater droughts is to use measures of precipitation deficits such as the standardised precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 or the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 as a proxy for groundwater drought and using linear models to relate precipitation and gwls khan et al 2008 bloomfield and marchant 2013 bloomfield et al 2015 kumar et al 2016 van loon et al 2017 however the correlation between spi or spei and sgi is typically highly variable one source of uncertainty in such simple correlations is because the effect of precipitation on gwls varies over time due for example to non linear changes in soil moisture and degree of saturation in the unsaturated zone or due to changes in saturated groundwater flow and discharge as a function of gwl consequently a simple linear model relating precipitation and gwls may not be appropriate impulse response functions irfs von asmuth et al 2002 von asmuth and bierkens 2005 can be used to describe the increase in gwl that will result from a single unit of precipitation as a function of time since the precipitation occurred irfs not only account for non linear relationships between precipitation and gwls but also when estimated on a site by site basis will take account of spatial variations in such relationships regardless of the specific non linear recharge or discharge processes in operation in a catchment irfs have previously been used to describe relationships between effective precipitation and gwls calver 1997 von asmuth et al 2002 von asmuth and bierkens 2005 karst hydrographs and precipitation long and derickson 1999 stream aquifer interactions hantush 2005 and spatial variation in recharge bakker et al 2007 process based distributed groundwater models are used to undertake groundwater resource assessments at the catchment scale they are designed to represent spatial variations in catchment and aquifer characteristics and can be used to model groundwater extremes upton and jackson 2011 however they require extensive data for calibration and can be difficult and costly to update frequently so are of limited use in the assessment of the status of groundwater drought site specific lumped parameter models are more flexible and typically easier to update and are increasingly being developed to provide a range of groundwater hydrological services including gwl status assessments for example aquimod a lumped parameter model mackay et al 2014 jackson et al 2016 marchant et al 2016 driven by rainfall data is used to produce 1 3 month outlooks for gwl for the uk hydrological outlooks 2017 prudhomme et al 2017 recently marchant et al 2016 incorporated aquimod as a fixed effect into a mixed model for simulation of gwls and used it to quantify uncertainties in gwl simulations gwl reconstructions using formal likelihood methods the mixed model approach enabled outliers and anomalies in the gwl data to be identified periods of missing data to be infilled and for hydrographs to be reconstructed on regular dates within a formal uncertainty framework however even relatively simple lumped parameter models require a number of parameters in the case of aquimod thirteen mackay et al 2014 to either be fitted to the data or determined from other sources building on the mixed model approach of marchant et al 2016 this paper reports on a simple approach to model groundwater drought status that both accounts for issues related to the availability and nature of gwl data and that takes account of catchment and aquifer heterogeneity and the heterogeneous propagation of droughts an irf similar to that of von asmuth et al 2002 is used as the fixed effect within the mixed model instead of a lumped parameter model such as aquimod this results in a more parsimonious model with fewer parameters that need to be fitted compared with aquimod while still accounting for the potentially spatially varying non linear relationship between precipitation and gwl the approach not only enables the issues of data quality to be addressed for example to screen out poor data or sites infill missing data and to model levels and drought status on a regular time step but also enables uncertainty in the modelled levels to be quantified the model does not require parameterisation using information on site characteristics and hence there are no a priori assumptions necessary about spatial variation in catchment or hydrogeological characteristics 3 study area and data 3 1 the study area fig 1 shows the location of major features of the study area the extent of the chalk aquifer in england and overlying clay with flints and crag deposits allen et al 1997 and the location of observation boreholes used in the spatio temporal analysis of groundwater drought status the chalk extends from the yorkshire coast in the north east of england southwards to east anglia along the chilterns and berkshire downs and throughout the london basin to the north and south downs on the margins of the weald and westward on the margins of and beneath the hampshire wessex basin although mapped as a single geological unit the chalk exhibits regional variations in stratigraphy and geological structure and intrinsic hydrogeological characteristics such as porosity permeability transmissivity storage and hydraulic diffusivity over a range of scales downing et al 2005 allen et al 1997 the chalk aquifer is a dual porosity dual permeability limestone aquifer where groundwater storage and flow are primarily dependent on the nature of the fracture system which may locally be sub karstic bloomfield 1996 allen et al 1997 macdonald and allen 2001 downing et al 2005 maurice et al 2006 groundwater levels in the chalk respond to local hydro climatology they are sensitive to episodes of drought and depend on a combination of catchment characteristics such as unsaturated zone thickness and intrinsic hydraulic properties of the aquifer such as hydraulic diffusivity bloomfield and marchant 2013 a characteristic feature of the chalk aquifer as noted by bloomfield et al 2015 and rudd et al 2017 is that compared with other aquifers in the uk such as the permo triassic sandstones and jurassic limestone aquifers it is relatively susceptible to droughts typically experiencing more severe and prolonged responses to droughts than other major aquifers in the uk as a first order approximation the broad meteorological drought history of the study area can be considered to be spatially homogeneous this claim is consistent with the previously documented spatial coherence of major hydrological droughts in the uk see region 4 of hannaford et al 2011 for example during the period 1960 2013 a number of episodes of major multi annual drought affected the chalk aquifer across the uk notably 1975 1976 1988 1992 1995 1997 2004 2006 and 2010 2012 marsh et al 2007 kendon et al 2013 bloomfield and marchant 2013 bloomfield et al 2015 however within the study area spatio temporal variations in the nature of groundwater droughts may be expected due to both spatial variation in the driving meteorology and the effects of heterogeneity in catchment and aquifer characteristics variably modifying the meteorological signals as they pass through to the groundwater system van loon 2015 3 2 data the borehole locations and gwl observations were downloaded from the environment agency s gwl monitoring network database environment agency 2014 the database included more than 4500 sites the sites are monitoring or observation boreholes and wells that are typically open throughout their length in the chalk and are not pumped or used for groundwater abstraction the termination depths and construction details for individual boreholes and wells were not available to this study and no screening of the data had been conducted prior to downloading of the data however although the observation boreholes represent a wide range of hydrogeological settings including unconfined and confined chalk sites close to or more distant to recharge and discharge areas and observation boreholes that may be variably affected by groundwater withdrawals from neighbouring abstraction boreholes or the effects of long term changes in water resource management the majority of sites reflect groundwater level variations in the unconfined chalk aquifer there was also great variation in the temporal frequency of gwl observations some borehole records include periods of sampling every 15 min whereas others included fewer than 10 observations in total the gwl data was subsampled so that there was no more than one observation per borehole per month the resultant distribution of monthly observations is shown in fig 2 fewer than 10 of the borehole records included an observation for more than half of the months between 1960 and 2013 note also that there are some time periods such as during the uk foot and mouth crisis in 2001 where very few observations are made because workers were restricted from visiting the boreholes fig 2 the precipitation data are taken from the ceh gear dataset tanguy et al 2015 this dataset consists of a 1 km2 gridded estimate of monthly rainfall derived from the met office national database of observed precipitation ceh gear uses a natural neighbour interpolation methodology including a normalisation step based on average annual rainfall to generate the daily and monthly estimates the total monthly precipitation from 1960 to 2013 has been extracted for each ceh gear 1 km2 grid square that contains a groundwater level observation borehole 4 methods 4 1 overview of modelling workflow the modelling workflow separately addresses the temporal fig 3 and spatial fig 4 variation of gwls to produce spatiotemporal predictions of groundwater drought status this approach contrasts with the use of space time models e g de cesare et al 2001 li et al 2016 to simultaneously account for both the spatial and temporal correlation amongst a set of observations of an environmental variable space time models can be used to estimate a variable of interest at a particular location and time using data that was not observed at either the same time or the same location however they require the assumptions that the degree of spatial and temporal correlation exhibited by the data is constant across the study region and for all times this assumption is inappropriate for gwl variation the chalk where markedly different patterns of temporal correlation are apparent at different boreholes the temporal portion fig 3 of the workflow treats each borehole separately and uses the available gwl and precipitation data to produce 1000 simulations of the sgi on a monthly time step the sgi simulations from each borehole are then combined in the spatial portion of the workflow fig 4 which leads to i the identification of spatial clusters of boreholes which exhibit similar patterns of sgi variation and ii space time predictions of the unimpacted drought status across the chalk for a monthly time step between 1960 and 2013 4 2 temporal modelling of groundwater levels temporal models of the gwls are required in each borehole so that the gwls might be predicted in months when they were not observed and to quantify the uncertainty of these predictions marchant et al 2016 demonstrated that this could be achieved for long and irregularly sampled gwl records by coupling mechanistic models of gwls such as aquimod mackay et al 2014 with a statistical or empirical model of the residuals they represented the observed gwls for month m z m by a mixed model 1 z m f m r m where f m was the estimated gwl according to aquimod and r m was the model residual the time series of residuals was assumed to be realized from a second order stationary random function with zero mean that was characterised by a marginal distribution function and a temporal correlation function in the mixed model context the f m are referred to as the fixed effects and the r m as the random effects dobson 1990 however for the majority of the boreholes in the chalk there are insufficient observations to estimate the large number at least 13 of aquimod parameters instead the approach based on irfs proposed by von asmuth et al 2002 is used to relate the gwls to the observed rainfall von asmuth et al 2002 suggested that gwl response to rainfall could be modelled using a convolution between an irf and the observed time series of effective rainfall i e 2 f m β 0 0 m α τ p e m τ d τ where α τ is the impulse response function p e m the effective rainfall in month m and β 0 is the gwl that occurs in the absence of any rainfall the effective rainfall is the rainfall minus the water that is lost to evapotranspiration their irf was based on a pearson type iii distribution 3 α τ a a s τ s 1 e x p a τ γ s where a a and s are parameters and γ s is the gamma function of order s if the effective rainfall is recorded every month then the integral in 2 may be discretized such that 4 f m β 0 τ 0 m α τ p e m τ in the uk natural seasonal patterns of gwl variability are primarily the result of the seasonal variation in evapotranspiration so here effective rainfall is replaced by the rainfall p m and sinusoids of periods of 6 and 12 months are added to the fixed effects to represent the seasonal variation caused by evapotranspiration the summation in eq 4 is also restricted to the previous n m 60 months hence if m m 1 m 2 m n t is the vector of months for which gwls were recorded then the fixed effects can be written 5 f m x β where x is the n 5 n m matrix 6 1 s i n 2 π m 1 12 c o s 2 π m 1 12 s i n 2 π m 1 6 c o s 2 π m 1 6 p m 1 p m 1 n m 1 1 s i n 2 π m n 12 c o s 2 π m n 12 s i n 2 π m n 6 c o s 2 π m n 6 p m n p m n n m 1 and β β 0 β 4 n m t is a vector of fixed effects parameters the β 1 β 2 β 3 and β 4 are the parameters for the sinusoid terms and the remaining β 4 i α i it is assumed that the random effects are realized from a second order stationary multivariate gaussian random function where the correlation is represented by a nested nugget and matérn function marchant and lark 2007 7 c h c 0 c 1 if h 0 c 1 g h for h 0 where 8 g h 1 2 ν 1 γ ν 2 ν h a ν k ν 2 ν h a here γ is the gamma function and k ν is a modified bessel function of the second kind of order ν the random effects model parameters are c 0 the nugget c 1 the partial sill a the distance parameter and ν the smoothness parameter thus the mixed model has a total of 12 parameters eight of these parameters are related to the fixed effects five fewer than the minimum required by aquimod and the remaining four are related to the random effects the parameters values for each borehole are estimated by maximum likelihood marchant et al 2016 the likelihood is a mathematical formula for the probability that a particular set of observations would have resulted from a specified statistical model the maximum likelihood estimator uses a numerical optimization routine to find the parameter values which lead to the largest likelihood value for the observed data in some of the chalk boreholes there was a negligible correlation between the fixed effects related to the rainfall irf and the observed gwls this might have been because the variation of gwls was primarily controlled by anthropogenic processes such as abstraction or because there were too few observations to reliably estimate the parameters of the irf in these circumstances the estimates of the irf parameters are likely to be uncertain and the mixed model could be overfitted this would mean that the model predictions on dates when the gwl was not observed are unreliable to check for this occurrence a simpler model of gwls for each borehole is estimated where the fixed effects consisted of only a constant and the two sinusoids the two models are compared by means of the akaike information criterion aic akaike 1973 9 a i c 2 k 2 l where k is the number of model parameters and l is the logarithm of the maximised likelihood the model that has the lowest aic is selected thus the aic is a criterion by which it is tested whether the additional three parameters of the irf lead to a substantial improvement of the fit of the model once the best fitting mixed model has been estimated it is used along with the observed gwls to predict gwls on dates when they were not observed within the best linear unbiased predictor marchant et al 2016 which is commonly referred to in the geostatistics literature as the universal kriging predictor webster and oliver 2007 this predictor yields a prediction z i of the expected gwl on each date t i and a covariance matrix for these predictions the entries on the main diagonal of this covariance matrix are the prediction variances σ i 2 which reflect the uncertainty of each individual prediction whereas the off diagonal elements describe the relationship between the errors on different dates the prediction variances can be used to validate the estimated mixed model via the standardised squared prediction error sspe θ i z i z i 2 σ i 2 where z i is the gwl predicted by the model for month i σ i 2 is the corresponding prediction variance and z i is the observed gwl for month i observation z i must be excluded from the predictor when calculating z i a leave one out cross validation is employed where each observation is omitted in turn and the remainder are used to predict the gwl on the corresponding date and to calculate the sspe if the errors are normally distributed then the sspe should be realized from a standardised chi squared distribution and the expected value of the mean of the sspes is equal to 1 the sspe provides a means by which to identify the small number of typographical errors that are contained in the dataset if a θ i value is greater than a threshold set at 50 then this indicates that z i is an outlier which might have undue influence on the model estimation procedure in this case the outlier is removed from the dataset and the mixed model is re estimated a large threshold value for the outliers has intentionally been chosen the expected number of false positives across the whole dataset according to the fitted model is fewer than 10 6 to ensure that the removed observations are errors in data recording rather that examples of extreme gwls once the model has been estimated it is used in combination with the available data to produce uncertain simulations of the gwls on a monthly time step the cholesky simulation approach deutsch and journel 1998 is applied to the predicted covariance matrix c to produce 1000 realizations of the errors in the predicted gwls the predictions are added to these simulations and the resultant time series are de seasonalized and normalised each of the resultant time to produce 1000 simulations for the borehole de seasonalization and normalisation is performed by applying the standardised groundwater index bloomfield and marchant 2013 a non parametric estimation that uses a normal scores transform webster and oliver 2007 of groundwater level data for each calendar month the nonparametric normalisation assigns a value to observations groundwater levels for a given month the normal scores transform is undertaken by applying the inverse normal cumulative distribution function to n equally spaced pi values ranging from 1 2n to 1 1 2n the values that result are the sgi values for the given month these are then re ordered such that the largest sgi value is assigned to the i for which pi is largest the second largest sgi value is assigned to the i for which pi is second largest and so on the normalisation is undertaken for each of the 12 calendar months separately and the resulting normalised monthly indices then merged to form a continuous sgi time series this modelling procedure was applied to the 948 boreholes with the most gwl observations the remaining boreholes generally had too few observations to identify the parameters of the irf 4 3 cluster analysis of the sgi series groups of similarly behaving sgi time series are formed by performing a cluster analysis webster and oliver 1990 discuss various clustering algorithms which lead to either hierarchical or non hierarchical groups of individuals here following bloomfield et al 2015 the flexible k means clustering method is used to form a specified number of non hierarchical groups the k means approach also requires that a distance function is specified which is used to assess the difference between different sgi time series in this case the euclidean distance between the time series is used a numerical optimisation routine is used to select the partitioning of the boreholes which minimizes the difference between each sgi time series and the centroid of the time series for the cluster in which it is contained this procedure is repeated for two to nine groups and then expert interpretation is used to decide which number of groups is most suitable to reflect our understanding of the hydrogeological system the expert interpretation is guided by the following aims of the clustering to identify and so exclude from further analysis sites that are systematically influenced by anthropogenic effects or that are outliers where the sgi time series do not correlate with the driving climatology and that the remaining clusters are spatially coherent and represent regional variations in groundwater droughts in the chalk the approach adopted is to identify the smallest number of clusters that reasonably satisfies the aims of the clustering note that these aims or rules are specific to the current study however for any given study area the target number of classes and hence the rules used can be adapted to reflect the regional hydrogeology and in particular any knowledge of heterogeneity in the aquifer systems under investigation 4 4 spatial interpolation of the sgi time series geostatistical methods webster and oliver 2007 are used to spatially interpolate simulated sgi values on each date a spatial correlation function is estimated for the sgi values by the method of moments webster and oliver 2007 this approach calculates the semi variance i e half the squared difference between pairs of observations and then estimates a model of how the semi variance varies with the distance separating the boreholes at which the observations were made in common with the temporal analyses the nested nugget and matérn model eqs 7 and 8 is used this ensures that the resultant correlation matrices are positive definite and that the prediction variances that result are not negative when calculating the semi variances comparisons are restricted to pairs of sgi values from the same date and from boreholes where the gwl was recorded on that date this ensures that the temporal variation and the estimation variance of the sgi do not unduly influence our estimated semi variances having estimated the spatial correlation function sgi values are spatially interpolated on the first day of each month and the uncertainty of these predictions estimated by kriging webster and oliver 2007 the kriging predictor is applied 1000 times taking a different simulated sgi value from each borehole each time the sgi prediction at each unobserved site is equal to the mean prediction for these 1000 iterations the variance of the 1000 predictions is calculated at each site and added to the spatial kriging variance to yield the total prediction variance thus this prediction variance accounts for both spatial and temporal uncertainty although this approach does assume that the random effects from each borehole for a particular month are independent any location that is more than 75 km from a borehole is omitted from the region where predictions are calculated since the correlation between the gwls at such a site and the observed gwls will be small and hence the predictions unreliable 5 results 5 1 temporal modelling of sgi values the results of the temporal modelling procedure are illustrated for two boreholes denoted a and b in fig 1 right borehole a is an observation borehole from the interfluve area of the eastern chilterns and has a monthly sgi hydrograph that shows annual and multi annual responses to the driving meteorology and no clear annual minima whereas borehole b is an observation borehole from the northern part of the hampshire basin with a monthly sgi hydrograph that is dominated by an annual signal and a consistent annual minima typically just below 80 m above sea level masl associated with a local groundwater base level fig 5 shows the estimated irfs for these two boreholes the borehole a irf takes almost two years to reach its peak and precipitation is still having some influence on the gwls 40 months after it has occurred in contrast the irf for borehole b reaches its peak after five months and it is negligibly small after 20 months thus the modelled and observed gwls from borehole a vary relatively smoothly fig 6 upper panel whereas the gwls from borehole b fig 6 lower panel have a much flashier pattern of variation the 95 confidence limits in the predicted gwls fig 6 are determined from the values that are simulated from the estimated mixed model the confidence limits for borehole a are generally narrow although they widen during periods such as 1998 where few gwl observations are available similarly the predictions of gwls for borehole b are rather uncertain in the early 1960s since this time precedes the observation of gwls at this borehole the sgi and 95 confidence limits of the sgi for each borehole are shown in fig 7 again these are based on the simulated gwls and for borehole a they are relatively narrow except at times when the gwls were not observed the confidence limits for the flashier sgi time series from borehole b are much wider particularly at times when the observed data were sparse when applying the temporal analysis workflow fig 3 across all of the boreholes it was necessary to remove 28 outlying gwl observations which were inconsistent with the initial estimated model once these outliers had been removed and the models re fitted the resultant mean sspes for each borehole were generally close to 1 for 93 of the boreholes table 1 the mean of the sspe was between 0 9 and 1 1 indicating that the average observed squared errors upon cross validation were on within 10 of the predicted squared errors of the best fitting models for each of the 948 boreholes analysed 77 included an irf and hence a significant relationship with precipitation table 1 overall the best fitting models for all the sites explained an average of 52 of the variation in gwls and on average more than half of this was explained by the irf component 5 2 cluster analysis of sgi time series modelled gwls from the 948 boreholes were used as the basis for the cluster analysis and the spatial distribution of sites for between two and nine clusters are shown in fig 8 following the rules set for cluster selection the results are shown in figs 8f and fig 9 and seven clusters have been identified the centroids i e averages for the sgi time series for these seven clusters are shown in fig 10 the seven clusters include two clusters of modelled hydrographs that show long term trends and a poor explanation of observed variation in gwls fig 10 and table 1 are interpreted as reflecting long term anthropogenic influence on sgi time series namely o cluster 7 cl7 shows an upward trend from 1960 to 2013 fig 10 where only 41 of the best fitting models include the irf table 1 and only 21 of the gwl variation is explained by the model sites in this cluster are not spatially coherent and are interpreted as being affected by a range of anthropogenic influences including for example previously documented post industrial groundwater rebound in the confined chalk beneath the central london lucas and robinson 1995 fig 9c o cluster 3 cl3 shows a downward trend fig 10 where only 29 of the best fitting models include the irf table 1 and only 12 of the gwl variation is explained by the model sites in this cluster like those in cl7 are widely dispersed and are interpreted as being due to long term or historic over abstraction from the chalk for example as previously documented in lincolnshire whitehead and lawrence 2006 and cambridgeshire petts et al 1999 acreman et al 2000 fig 9c one cluster cluster 4 cl4 of modelled hydrographs shows no trend and a very poor explanation of observed variation in gwls table 1 and fig 9c this cluster is interpreted as corresponding to sites where there is insufficient evidence observations to model the gwl variation the remaining four clusters clusters 1 2 5 and 6 cl1 cl2 cl5 and cl6 respectively occupy broadly spatially coherent regions with cl1 coinciding with the berkshire and north wessex downs cl2 with yorkshire lincolnshire and north norfolk cl5 the south downs and wessex and cl6 coincides with the chilterns north downs and suffolk a high proportion of the models in each of these clusters include irf models and a high proportion of the variance of gwls is explained by the models table 1 sites in clusters cl7 cl3 and cl4 are not analysed further since they are considered to be either anthropogenically impacted cl7 and cl3 or the modelled gwls are inferred to be unrelated to precipitation cl4 the remaining four clusters cl1 cl2 cl5 and cl6 are taken to represent the broadly unimpacted responses of groundwater levels in the unconfined or partially confined aquifer to the driving meteorology as modified by catchment and aquifer characteristics and are the focus of subsequent analysis the average and standardised to a sum of one irfs for each of the four unimpacted clusters are shown in fig 11 the irf for cl1 and cl2 are very similar reaching a peak after about 7 months and becoming negligibly small after 40 months thus the sgi centroids for these two clusters fig 10 have a similar degree of smoothness the irf for cl5 immediately reaches its peak and decreases to be negligibly small soon after 20 months this behaviour is reflected by a much flashier sgi centroid in fig 10 conversely the irf from cl6 remains positive beyond 50 months corresponding to a very smooth sgi centroid for the four unimpacted clusters the vast majority of best fitting models include the irf table 1 and the models for cl1 cl2 and cl5 on average explain more than 65 of gwl variation this level of performance is comparable with that achieved using aquimod lumped parameter model jackson et al 2016 on average only 45 of the variation in the gwls is explained for cl6 boreholes but this is consistent with the findings of marchant et al 2016 that predictive performance is relatively poor for smoothly varying gwls the mean sspes are generally close to one for all of the clusters table 1 although the proportion of sites where the mean sspe is outside the range 0 9 1 1 is relatively large for the three impacted clusters and the more smoothly varying cl6 to understand what may be influencing the composition of the clusters including their temporal and spatial features it is helpful to consider both the precipitation time series associated with each sgi cluster and the spatial distribution of key catchment and hydrogeological factors fig 12 shows the mean normalised and standardised precipitation in the preceding 12 months spi12 bloomfield and marchant 2013 for clusters cl1 cl2 cl5 and cl6 fig 12 is consistent with the assumption that the broad drought history of the study area is spatially homogeneous time series of spi12 for each of the four clusters closely parallel the spi12 for the region as a whole and all four show the previously documented major episodes of drought 1975 1976 1988 1992 1995 1997 2004 2006 and 2010 2012 marsh et al 1994 marsh et al 2007 kendon et al 2013 bloomfield and marchant 2013 bloomfield et al 2015 although it is noted that two additional episodes of spi12 drought taken here as spi12 1 of a similar magnitude to previously recorded episodes of drought are also indicated for 1962 1966 and 1972 1973 there are however minor deviations in the spi12 time series between individual clusters and the region as a whole for example the 1975 1976 spi12 drought was more acute in cl1 centred on the southern chalk rather than in cl2 i e over the chalk of the north east the 1988 1992 event appears to have been both more acute and continuous in cl2 than in cl1 and cl5 where it was slightly less severe and consisted of three individual phases and the onset of the 2011 2012 drought appears to be slightly earlier in cl1 than the other three clusters fig 12 even though episodes of groundwater drought taken here as sgi 1 are more attenuated than the equivalent drought in the driving meteorology compare fig 10 with fig 12 and as would be expected from van loon 2015 the subtle differences in the driving meteorology are propagated through to and are reflected in similar differences in the sgi time series for example the sgi centroids for cl1 and cl2 are highly correlated fig 10 but some differences are evident the 1976 groundwater drought appears to be more severe for cl1 while the groundwater drought in the early 1990s is continuous for cl2 whereas in cl1 there is a small break and the 2010 2012 groundwater drought commences slightly earlier in cl1 based on the above it appears that small changes in the driving meteorology within the study area between cl2 in the north east of the study area and cl1 and cl5 in the south of the chalk have had some influence on the composition of the clusters the sgi centroids fig 10 represent an integrated system response to the driving meteorology however there are features of the four clusters and their expression of groundwater droughts that appear to be influenced by regional variation in unsaturated zone and recharge process and by some saturated zone and catchment characteristics sites in cl6 may be influenced by features of the regional hydrogeology that act to modify recharge and hence affect the form of the sgi hydrographs cl6 is associated with east anglia the chilterns and the north downs and is characterised by the smoothest of the sgi centroids fig 10 across large parts of east anglia the chalk is covered by the crag a series of younger gravels sands and silts and by glacial deposits jones et al 2000 weathering deposits in the form of clay with flints are also present extensively over the chalk of the chilterns and north downs goudie 1993 bloomfield et al 2009 the hydraulic relationship between these overlying deposits and the chalk is locally complex for example the crag may be in hydraulic continuity with the underlying chalk or may be separated from the chalk by a relatively low permeability clay jones et al 2000 where it is in hydraulic continuity it adds significantly to the storage of the aquifer where the basal clay is present the chalk may locally be confined over the chilterns and the north downs the clay with flints deposits another relatively low permeability clay is typically found on high ground across the main recharge area associated with cl6 here the clay with flints limits recharge but also leads to focused recharge at the margins of the deposit allen et al 1997 macdonald et al 1998 although locally complex in their hydrogeological effects at a regional scale these deposits that overly the chalk may either add significant storage to the chalk aquifer or limit or delay recharge in both instances these processes will contribute to the relatively smooth nature of the sgi centroid of cl6 fig 10 bloomfield and marchant 2013 have previously shown that the range of temporal autocorrelation in the sgi from a borehole scales with the hydraulic diffusivity of the aquifer consequently it could be expected that the spatially coherent sgi clusters fig 9b should reflect any spatial heterogeneity in transmissivity t and storativity s of the chalk at a regional scale macdonald and allen 2001 analysed the aquifer properties of the chalk based on 2100 pumping tests in four regions southern the thames basin including the north downs east anglia and yorkshire and lincolnshire but the results were inconclusive they found that the distribution of t and s was broadly similar for all four regions and that within a given region transmissivity and storage co efficients could vary by over five orders of magnitude however they also noted that the dataset was highly biased most pumping tests have been undertaken in valley areas where the yield of the chalk is highest and it is unclear how this may have influenced the results of the analysis of the t and s data the inference from these observations is that there appears to be no strong or reliable evidence for a relationship between t and s and the spatial distribution of the clusters notwithstanding this relationships between the location of the observation borehole catchment boundaries and local groundwater level base levels and hence unsaturated zone thickness will influence the form of the sgi time series peters et al 2006 bloomfield and marchant 2013 compared with the other three clusters catchments in wessex and the south downs associated with cl5 are typically relatively small and the chalk is relatively highly faulted and fractured compared with other regions jones and robins 1999 these observations are consistent with the relatively flashy nature of the cl5 sgi centroid compared with cl1 cl2 and cl6 fig 9 in summary it is not trivial to disentangle the various contributing factors to the form of the four sgi clusters however there is evidence that small changes in the driving meteorology between the north east of the study area and the south of the study area may have influenced the formation of clusters cl1 cl2 and cl5 that overlying deposits and their effect on unsaturated zone storage and recharge may have influenced the formation of cl6 and cl5 is consistent with known spatial variations in catchment and rock mass characteristics 5 3 spatial interpolation of sgi values the estimated spatial variogram function for the sgi predictions for all data in clusters cl1 cl2 cl5 and cl6 is shown in fig 13 the spatial variation is relatively smooth with little difference between sgi values a few km apart and there is some degree of spatial correlation beyond 100 km this is consistent with the spatial coherency of the clusters typically of the order of 100 200 km fig 9b using the spatial variogram function sgi values have been spatially interpolated for each month from january 1960 to march 2013 spatial interpolations of the sgi are shown for three major episodes of drought in fig 14 1975 1975 event fig 15 1988 1992 event and fig 16 2011 2012 event and reflect the observed differences between the sgi centroids for clusters cl1 cl2 cl5 and cl6 fig 10 in figs 14 16 the distribution of negative values of sgi in the chalk have been mapped where sgi 0 5 is denoted as pre drought 1 as groundwater drought 1 5 as a severe groundwater drought and 2 as an extreme groundwater drought comparison of figs 14 16 shows the unique spatio temporal nature of each episode of groundwater drought for example fig 14 shows that the 1975 1976 drought although national in extent at its peak in the summer of 1976 was most extreme in southern england hampshire and the berkshire downs consistent with previous observations of rodda and marsh 2011 the 2011 2012 groundwater drought fig 16 was also national in extent however it was less pronounced than the 1975 1976 event had a slightly more easterly footprint and at its height in late winter spring 2012 was most extreme in north norfolk and parts of the chilterns and berkshire consistent with the observations of marsh et al 2013 both the 1975 1976 and 2011 2012 episodes were effectively two winter groundwater droughts where in any given region the drought status grew continuously over the entire period to a maximum and then declined as the drought broke marsh et al 2013 however in contrast to both these episodes the 1988 1992 event was a longer multi annual event and is characterised by waves of increasing and decreasing groundwater drought status throughout the longer period for example fig 15 shows yorkshire and parts of hampshire passing into and back out of drought severe drought status before finally reaching peak drought status in spring summer 1992 compared with both the 1975 1976 and 2011 2012 droughts at its peak the 1988 1992 groundwater drought was more extensive across the whole of the english chalk however both before and after peak drought status see march 1992 fig 15 the episode generally had a more north easterly focus than the other two episodes of drought marsh et al 1994 6 discussion the empirical approach adopted here successfully meets the challenges of assessing the severity and distribution of groundwater droughts while explicitly addressing issues associated with the availability and nature of gwl data and also accounting for and quantifying the spatio temporal heterogeneity of episodes of drought the empirical approach uses available gwl data for a region in this case for the chalk of the uk and requires no additional information other than precipitation data it does not need any process based assumptions to be made and the models do not require parameterisation using information about site characteristics as a consequence it is not necessary to have additional information about the spatial variation in catchment or hydrogeological characteristics over the modelled region this means that the approach is applicable for use in monitoring and assessing groundwater drought status wherever there are suitable available gwl observations and precipitation data the approach is more parsimonious with respect to the number of parameters that need to be calibrated than aquimod a process based lumped model while at the same time the performance of the empirical model has been shown to be comparable with that achieved using aquimod jackson et al 2016 the modelling scheme figs 3 and 4 takes gwl time series data however irregular or noisy and through sub sampling and modelling transforms these into regular monthly modelled gwl time series that can be correlated with precipitation data to estimate sgi and hence groundwater drought status in this scheme as with previous studies khan et al 2008 bloomfield and marchant 2013 bloomfield et al 2015 kumar et al 2016 van loon et al 2017 precipitation is used as a proxy for groundwater drought status however the mixed model differs from and is an improvement on those previous studies that use proxies in two main ways by using an irf calver 1997 von asmuth et al 2002 the empirical approach accounts for non linearities in the relationship between precipitation and groundwater levels in addition the method explicitly quantifies the uncertainty in both the modelled site and spatial groundwater drought status fig 7 fig 17 shows spatial variation of the sgi prediction variance i e uncertainty across the chalk for november 1962 and november 2012 the average prediction variances across the chalk are 0 17 in november 1962 and 0 14 in november 2012 this difference reflects the greater number of groundwater observations in 2012 spatially the uncertainty increases with distance from the nearest borehole van lanen et al 2016 laaha et al 2017 and van loon et al 2017 have each provided assessments of and commentaries on the last major european drought in 2015 van loon et al 2017 note that there is a need to promote more long term groundwater measurement and international sharing of groundwater level data we re emphasise this need data driven models of drought status such as the one described here require relatively long term time series data across wide geographical areas to adequately represent variations in spatio temporal status of groundwater droughts laaha et al 2017 point out that a particular failing of hydrological assessments during the european drought of 2015 was the inability to obtain and analyse data in near real time in that context any models of hydrological status that are calibrated on precipitation data which is available in near real time and that can be used in a nowcasting mode or for short term forecasts of drought status for example out to one or two months would be highly valuable although outside the scope of the present study the empirical model described here is amenable to be used in such a manner the precision of these forecasts in a particular region will greatly depend upon the degree of temporal autocorrelation amongst the observed gwls in nearby boreholes van lanen et al 2016 noted that during droughts such as that in europe in 2015 groundwater resources are stressed not just due to precipitation deficits but also due to over abstraction and that typically no separation is made between impacts due to the drought itself as compared to abstractions due to increased groundwater exploitation this observation has been further developed by van loon et al 2016 in their analysis of drought in the anthropocene although not the focus of the current study the modelling approach adopted here lends itself well to identification of the impacts of abstraction on groundwater droughts because the modelling does not rely on process based assumptions of the hydrogeology at each site it is easy to identify the degree to which variation in groundwater levels can be explained by variations in precipitation alone where it is not possible for the model to explain groundwater levels adequately it is reasonable to postulate that in many cases the effects of abstraction may be significant at that site for example in the present study sites in clusters cl3 and cl7 have been inferred to be affected by long term changes in groundwater management with cluster cl3 interpreted as showing evidence of long term abstraction extracting episodes of drought from hydrographs from cl3 where historic over abstraction has previously been documented e g whitehead and lawrence 2006 and systematically analysing these in the context of equivalent hydrographs from cluster cl2 hydrographs from the same region but that show no influence of long term abstraction figs 9 and 10 should provide new insights into the effects of long term abstraction on the onset magnitude and duration groundwater drought acknowledgements we would like to thank mark whiteman as well as staff at the crowmarsh gifford office of the environment agency for

7076,an empirical geo statistical modelling scheme is developed to address the challenges of modelling the severity and distribution of groundwater droughts given their spatially and temporally heterogeneous nature and given typically highly irregular groundwater level observations in space and time the scheme is tested using gwl measurements from 948 observation boreholes across the chalk aquifer uk to estimate monthly groundwater drought status from 1960 to 2013 for each borehole monthly gwls are simulated using empirical mixed models where the fixed effects are based on applying an impulse response function to the local monthly precipitation modelled gwls are standardised using the standardised groundwater index sgi and the monthly sgi values interpolated across the aquifer to produce spatially distributed monthly maps of sgi drought status for 54 years for the chalk the mixed models include fewer parameters than comparable lumped parameter groundwater models while explaining a similar proportion more than 65 of gwl variation in addition the empirical modelling approach enables confidence bounds on the predicted gwls and sgi values to be estimated without the need for prior information about catchment or aquifer parameters the results of the modelling scheme are illustrated for three major episodes of multi annual drought 1975 1976 1988 1992 2011 2012 they agree with previous documented analyses of the groundwater droughts while providing for the first time a systematic spatially coherent characterisation of the events the scheme is amenable to use in near real time to provide short term forecasts of groundwater drought status if suitable forecasts of the driving meteorology are available keywords groundwater drought standardised groundwater level index sgi spatio temporal variability of groundwater levels impulse response function mixed model kriging 1 introduction groundwater drought is a type of hydrological drought defined as a period of below normal groundwater level or reduced spring discharge tallaksen and van lanen 2004 mishra and singh 2010 van loon 2015 it is a natural hazard that can have a wide range of often profound social economic and environmental impacts shahid and hazarika 2010 hughes et al 2012 van dijk et al 2013 medellin azuara et al 2015 including reductions in deployable output from boreholes potentially leading to costly restrictions to public supply reduced abstractions for agriculture and industry and reduction in groundwater discharge to groundwater supported rivers and wetlands which can cause ecological stress and lead to loss of amenity value lange et al 2017 consequently there is a need to assess the severity and distribution of groundwater droughts to improve groundwater drought warnings to contribute to improved water resource decision making during episodes of drought and to improve longer term drought and water resources management plans van lanen et al 2016 however assessment of the severity and distribution of groundwater droughts is challenging due to a combination of issues primarily related to the availability and nature of groundwater level gwl data bachmair et al 2016 van loon et al 2017 and because groundwater droughts are commonly spatially and temporally heterogeneous in character peters et al 2006 mendicino et al 2008 tallaksen et al 2009 bloomfield et al 2015 although there is increasing use of telemetry gwls are still often measured at relatively low frequencies on the order of days to months or seasons depending on the purpose of the groundwater monitoring li et al 2015 in addition gwl data are often temporally irregular and may contain artefacts as a result the availability of suitable gwl data at timescales relevant to the systematic assessment of droughts is often limited van loon et al 2017 hydrological droughts propagate from a spatially and temporally heterogeneous meteorological signal precipitation deficit through soils soil moisture deficit and via reduced recharge lead to reduced groundwater levels peters et al 2003 the spatio temporal characteristics of the drought signal changes as it passes through the terrestrial water cycle so that groundwater droughts are typically lagged and attenuated compared with meteorological droughts van loon 2015 there are many catchment and aquifer related factors that influence these changes in drought signal and that can affect the eventual spatio temporal expression of groundwater droughts including the nature of land cover and the thickness and hydraulic characteristics of the soil and unsaturated zone that influence recharge the hydraulic properties of the saturated zone and the location and hydraulic characteristics of major groundwater discharge areas tallaksen et al 2009 bloomfield et al 2015 this paper describes the first modelling method to take account of both the irregular and uncertain nature of groundwater level data and the spatial and temporally varying nature of droughts as they propagate through the terrestrial water cycle to estimate the monthly status of groundwater droughts including confidence bands on those estimates the novel modelling scheme is tested with a large gwl data set from the cretaceous chalk limestone the main aquifer in the united kingdom the results of the modelling are illustrated with the analysis of three major episodes of multi annual drought across the chalk 1995 1996 1988 1992 and 2011 2012 and it is shown that they provide a high level of detail with regard to spatio temparal variability of individual episodes of groundwater drought across the study area finally the underlying causes of heterogeneity in the modelled gwls and droughts are discussed as are the wider applications of the modelling scheme for groundwater drought and groundwater resource assessments 2 modelling context a range of methods have previously been used to model groundwater drought status including simple graphical representations of groundwater levels for example of ranked historic records the use of proxies of groundwater drought status primarily to address issues related to the lack of suitable gwl data process based distributed groundwater models and more recently the use of multiple site specific empirical and lumped parameter models estimating groundwater drought status across a region can be as simple as relating recent observations of gwls to historic data for a given site for example by rank or percentile marsh et al 2013 natural environment research council 2017 usgs 2017 however such approaches rarely reveal sufficient detail of heterogeneity within episodes of groundwater drought to help with management responses van loon et al 2017 bachmair et al 2016 note in a recent survey of drought monitoring that there is a lack of widespread monitoring of groundwater drought and that the scarcity of water status observations especially for groundwater reflects the common focus on drought seen through the lens of rainfall and soil moisture that can be easily remotely monitored and or modelled in this context attempts have been made to overcome the common limitations of gwl data for drought status assessments by modelling gwl data with other more spatially extensive and or higher frequency and or more temporally regular hydrometric data such as remotely sensed data including for example data from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace tapley et al 2004 the modelled gwl data can then be used as proxies for groundwater drought status and hence used to obtain more detailed spatio temporal descriptions of episodes of groundwater drought however remotely sensed data products can have low spatial resolution e g 400 km grid squares for grace and the use of remotely sensed data can be particularly sensitive to model parameterisation such as depth to water table and depth to bedrock and hence to spatial variations in often uncertain catchment properties e g li and rodell 2015 another approach to assess and analyse groundwater droughts is to use measures of precipitation deficits such as the standardised precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 or the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 as a proxy for groundwater drought and using linear models to relate precipitation and gwls khan et al 2008 bloomfield and marchant 2013 bloomfield et al 2015 kumar et al 2016 van loon et al 2017 however the correlation between spi or spei and sgi is typically highly variable one source of uncertainty in such simple correlations is because the effect of precipitation on gwls varies over time due for example to non linear changes in soil moisture and degree of saturation in the unsaturated zone or due to changes in saturated groundwater flow and discharge as a function of gwl consequently a simple linear model relating precipitation and gwls may not be appropriate impulse response functions irfs von asmuth et al 2002 von asmuth and bierkens 2005 can be used to describe the increase in gwl that will result from a single unit of precipitation as a function of time since the precipitation occurred irfs not only account for non linear relationships between precipitation and gwls but also when estimated on a site by site basis will take account of spatial variations in such relationships regardless of the specific non linear recharge or discharge processes in operation in a catchment irfs have previously been used to describe relationships between effective precipitation and gwls calver 1997 von asmuth et al 2002 von asmuth and bierkens 2005 karst hydrographs and precipitation long and derickson 1999 stream aquifer interactions hantush 2005 and spatial variation in recharge bakker et al 2007 process based distributed groundwater models are used to undertake groundwater resource assessments at the catchment scale they are designed to represent spatial variations in catchment and aquifer characteristics and can be used to model groundwater extremes upton and jackson 2011 however they require extensive data for calibration and can be difficult and costly to update frequently so are of limited use in the assessment of the status of groundwater drought site specific lumped parameter models are more flexible and typically easier to update and are increasingly being developed to provide a range of groundwater hydrological services including gwl status assessments for example aquimod a lumped parameter model mackay et al 2014 jackson et al 2016 marchant et al 2016 driven by rainfall data is used to produce 1 3 month outlooks for gwl for the uk hydrological outlooks 2017 prudhomme et al 2017 recently marchant et al 2016 incorporated aquimod as a fixed effect into a mixed model for simulation of gwls and used it to quantify uncertainties in gwl simulations gwl reconstructions using formal likelihood methods the mixed model approach enabled outliers and anomalies in the gwl data to be identified periods of missing data to be infilled and for hydrographs to be reconstructed on regular dates within a formal uncertainty framework however even relatively simple lumped parameter models require a number of parameters in the case of aquimod thirteen mackay et al 2014 to either be fitted to the data or determined from other sources building on the mixed model approach of marchant et al 2016 this paper reports on a simple approach to model groundwater drought status that both accounts for issues related to the availability and nature of gwl data and that takes account of catchment and aquifer heterogeneity and the heterogeneous propagation of droughts an irf similar to that of von asmuth et al 2002 is used as the fixed effect within the mixed model instead of a lumped parameter model such as aquimod this results in a more parsimonious model with fewer parameters that need to be fitted compared with aquimod while still accounting for the potentially spatially varying non linear relationship between precipitation and gwl the approach not only enables the issues of data quality to be addressed for example to screen out poor data or sites infill missing data and to model levels and drought status on a regular time step but also enables uncertainty in the modelled levels to be quantified the model does not require parameterisation using information on site characteristics and hence there are no a priori assumptions necessary about spatial variation in catchment or hydrogeological characteristics 3 study area and data 3 1 the study area fig 1 shows the location of major features of the study area the extent of the chalk aquifer in england and overlying clay with flints and crag deposits allen et al 1997 and the location of observation boreholes used in the spatio temporal analysis of groundwater drought status the chalk extends from the yorkshire coast in the north east of england southwards to east anglia along the chilterns and berkshire downs and throughout the london basin to the north and south downs on the margins of the weald and westward on the margins of and beneath the hampshire wessex basin although mapped as a single geological unit the chalk exhibits regional variations in stratigraphy and geological structure and intrinsic hydrogeological characteristics such as porosity permeability transmissivity storage and hydraulic diffusivity over a range of scales downing et al 2005 allen et al 1997 the chalk aquifer is a dual porosity dual permeability limestone aquifer where groundwater storage and flow are primarily dependent on the nature of the fracture system which may locally be sub karstic bloomfield 1996 allen et al 1997 macdonald and allen 2001 downing et al 2005 maurice et al 2006 groundwater levels in the chalk respond to local hydro climatology they are sensitive to episodes of drought and depend on a combination of catchment characteristics such as unsaturated zone thickness and intrinsic hydraulic properties of the aquifer such as hydraulic diffusivity bloomfield and marchant 2013 a characteristic feature of the chalk aquifer as noted by bloomfield et al 2015 and rudd et al 2017 is that compared with other aquifers in the uk such as the permo triassic sandstones and jurassic limestone aquifers it is relatively susceptible to droughts typically experiencing more severe and prolonged responses to droughts than other major aquifers in the uk as a first order approximation the broad meteorological drought history of the study area can be considered to be spatially homogeneous this claim is consistent with the previously documented spatial coherence of major hydrological droughts in the uk see region 4 of hannaford et al 2011 for example during the period 1960 2013 a number of episodes of major multi annual drought affected the chalk aquifer across the uk notably 1975 1976 1988 1992 1995 1997 2004 2006 and 2010 2012 marsh et al 2007 kendon et al 2013 bloomfield and marchant 2013 bloomfield et al 2015 however within the study area spatio temporal variations in the nature of groundwater droughts may be expected due to both spatial variation in the driving meteorology and the effects of heterogeneity in catchment and aquifer characteristics variably modifying the meteorological signals as they pass through to the groundwater system van loon 2015 3 2 data the borehole locations and gwl observations were downloaded from the environment agency s gwl monitoring network database environment agency 2014 the database included more than 4500 sites the sites are monitoring or observation boreholes and wells that are typically open throughout their length in the chalk and are not pumped or used for groundwater abstraction the termination depths and construction details for individual boreholes and wells were not available to this study and no screening of the data had been conducted prior to downloading of the data however although the observation boreholes represent a wide range of hydrogeological settings including unconfined and confined chalk sites close to or more distant to recharge and discharge areas and observation boreholes that may be variably affected by groundwater withdrawals from neighbouring abstraction boreholes or the effects of long term changes in water resource management the majority of sites reflect groundwater level variations in the unconfined chalk aquifer there was also great variation in the temporal frequency of gwl observations some borehole records include periods of sampling every 15 min whereas others included fewer than 10 observations in total the gwl data was subsampled so that there was no more than one observation per borehole per month the resultant distribution of monthly observations is shown in fig 2 fewer than 10 of the borehole records included an observation for more than half of the months between 1960 and 2013 note also that there are some time periods such as during the uk foot and mouth crisis in 2001 where very few observations are made because workers were restricted from visiting the boreholes fig 2 the precipitation data are taken from the ceh gear dataset tanguy et al 2015 this dataset consists of a 1 km2 gridded estimate of monthly rainfall derived from the met office national database of observed precipitation ceh gear uses a natural neighbour interpolation methodology including a normalisation step based on average annual rainfall to generate the daily and monthly estimates the total monthly precipitation from 1960 to 2013 has been extracted for each ceh gear 1 km2 grid square that contains a groundwater level observation borehole 4 methods 4 1 overview of modelling workflow the modelling workflow separately addresses the temporal fig 3 and spatial fig 4 variation of gwls to produce spatiotemporal predictions of groundwater drought status this approach contrasts with the use of space time models e g de cesare et al 2001 li et al 2016 to simultaneously account for both the spatial and temporal correlation amongst a set of observations of an environmental variable space time models can be used to estimate a variable of interest at a particular location and time using data that was not observed at either the same time or the same location however they require the assumptions that the degree of spatial and temporal correlation exhibited by the data is constant across the study region and for all times this assumption is inappropriate for gwl variation the chalk where markedly different patterns of temporal correlation are apparent at different boreholes the temporal portion fig 3 of the workflow treats each borehole separately and uses the available gwl and precipitation data to produce 1000 simulations of the sgi on a monthly time step the sgi simulations from each borehole are then combined in the spatial portion of the workflow fig 4 which leads to i the identification of spatial clusters of boreholes which exhibit similar patterns of sgi variation and ii space time predictions of the unimpacted drought status across the chalk for a monthly time step between 1960 and 2013 4 2 temporal modelling of groundwater levels temporal models of the gwls are required in each borehole so that the gwls might be predicted in months when they were not observed and to quantify the uncertainty of these predictions marchant et al 2016 demonstrated that this could be achieved for long and irregularly sampled gwl records by coupling mechanistic models of gwls such as aquimod mackay et al 2014 with a statistical or empirical model of the residuals they represented the observed gwls for month m z m by a mixed model 1 z m f m r m where f m was the estimated gwl according to aquimod and r m was the model residual the time series of residuals was assumed to be realized from a second order stationary random function with zero mean that was characterised by a marginal distribution function and a temporal correlation function in the mixed model context the f m are referred to as the fixed effects and the r m as the random effects dobson 1990 however for the majority of the boreholes in the chalk there are insufficient observations to estimate the large number at least 13 of aquimod parameters instead the approach based on irfs proposed by von asmuth et al 2002 is used to relate the gwls to the observed rainfall von asmuth et al 2002 suggested that gwl response to rainfall could be modelled using a convolution between an irf and the observed time series of effective rainfall i e 2 f m β 0 0 m α τ p e m τ d τ where α τ is the impulse response function p e m the effective rainfall in month m and β 0 is the gwl that occurs in the absence of any rainfall the effective rainfall is the rainfall minus the water that is lost to evapotranspiration their irf was based on a pearson type iii distribution 3 α τ a a s τ s 1 e x p a τ γ s where a a and s are parameters and γ s is the gamma function of order s if the effective rainfall is recorded every month then the integral in 2 may be discretized such that 4 f m β 0 τ 0 m α τ p e m τ in the uk natural seasonal patterns of gwl variability are primarily the result of the seasonal variation in evapotranspiration so here effective rainfall is replaced by the rainfall p m and sinusoids of periods of 6 and 12 months are added to the fixed effects to represent the seasonal variation caused by evapotranspiration the summation in eq 4 is also restricted to the previous n m 60 months hence if m m 1 m 2 m n t is the vector of months for which gwls were recorded then the fixed effects can be written 5 f m x β where x is the n 5 n m matrix 6 1 s i n 2 π m 1 12 c o s 2 π m 1 12 s i n 2 π m 1 6 c o s 2 π

the parameters for the sinusoid terms and the remaining β 4 i α i it is assumed that the random effects are realized from a second order stationary multivariate gaussian random function where the correlation is represented by a nested nugget and matérn function marchant and lark 2007 7 c h c 0 c 1 if h 0 c 1 g h for h 0 where 8 g h 1 2 ν 1 γ ν 2 ν h a ν k ν 2 ν h a here γ is the gamma function and k ν is a modified bessel function of the second kind of order ν the random effects model parameters are c 0 the nugget c 1 the partial sill a the distance parameter and ν the smoothness parameter thus the mixed model has a total of 12 parameters eight of these parameters are related to the fixed effects five fewer than the minimum required by aquimod and the remaining four are related to the random effects the parameters values for each borehole are estimated by maximum likelihood marchant et al 2016 the likelihood is a mathematical formula for the probability that a particular set of observations would have resulted from a specified statistical model the maximum likelihood estimator uses a numerical optimization routine to find the parameter values which lead to the largest likelihood value for the observed data in some of the chalk boreholes there was a negligible correlation between the fixed effects related to the rainfall irf and the observed gwls this might have been because the variation of gwls was primarily controlled by anthropogenic processes such as abstraction or because there were too few observations to reliably estimate the parameters of the irf in these circumstances the estimates of the irf parameters are likely to be uncertain and the mixed model could be overfitted this would mean that the model predictions on dates when the gwl was not observed are unreliable to check for this occurrence a simpler model of gwls for each borehole is estimated where the fixed effects consisted of only a constant and the two sinusoids the two models are compared by means of the akaike information criterion aic akaike 1973 9 a i c 2 k 2 l where k is the number of model parameters and l is the logarithm of the maximised likelihood the model that has the lowest aic is selected thus the aic is a criterion by which it is tested whether the additional three parameters of the irf lead to a substantial improvement of the fit of the model once the best fitting mixed model has been estimated it is used along with the observed gwls to predict gwls on dates when they were not observed within the best linear unbiased predictor marchant et al 2016 which is commonly referred to in the geostatistics literature as the universal kriging predictor webster and oliver 2007 this predictor yields a prediction z i of the expected gwl on each date t i and a covariance matrix for these predictions the entries on the main diagonal of this covariance matrix are the prediction variances σ i 2 which reflect the uncertainty of each individual prediction whereas the off diagonal elements describe the relationship between the errors on different dates the prediction variances can be used to validate the estimated mixed model via the standardised squared prediction error sspe θ i z i z i 2 σ i 2 where z i is the gwl predicted by the model for month i σ i 2 is the corresponding prediction variance and z i is the observed gwl for month i observation z i must be excluded from the predictor when calculating z i a leave one out cross validation is employed where each observation is omitted in turn and the remainder are used to predict the gwl on the corresponding date and to calculate the sspe if the errors are normally distributed then the sspe should be realized from a standardised chi squared distribution and the expected value of the mean of the sspes is equal to 1 the sspe provides a means by which to identify the small number of typographical errors that are contained in the dataset if a θ i value is greater than a threshold set at 50 then this indicates that z i is an outlier which might have undue influence on the model estimation procedure in this case the outlier is removed from the dataset and the mixed model is re estimated a large threshold value for the outliers has intentionally been chosen the expected number of false positives across the whole dataset according to the fitted model is fewer than 10 6 to ensure that the removed observations are errors in data recording rather that examples of extreme gwls once the model has been estimated it is used in combination with the available data to produce uncertain simulations of the gwls on a monthly time step the cholesky simulation approach deutsch and journel 1998 is applied to the predicted covariance matrix c to produce 1000 realizations of the errors in the predicted gwls the predictions are added to these simulations and the resultant time series are de seasonalized and normalised each of the resultant time to produce 1000 simulations for the borehole de seasonalization and normalisation is performed by applying the standardised groundwater index bloomfield and marchant 2013 a non parametric estimation that uses a normal scores transform webster and oliver 2007 of groundwater level data for each calendar month the nonparametric normalisation assigns a value to observations groundwater levels for a given month the normal scores transform is undertaken by applying the inverse normal cumulative distribution function to n equally spaced pi values ranging from 1 2n to 1 1 2n the values that result are the sgi values for the given month these are then re ordered such that the largest sgi value is assigned to the i for which pi is largest the second largest sgi value is assigned to the i for which pi is second largest and so on the normalisation is undertaken for each of the 12 calendar months separately and the resulting normalised monthly indices then merged to form a continuous sgi time series this modelling procedure was applied to the 948 boreholes with the most gwl observations the remaining boreholes generally had too few observations to identify the parameters of the irf 4 3 cluster analysis of the sgi series groups of similarly behaving sgi time series are formed by performing a cluster analysis webster and oliver 1990 discuss various clustering algorithms which lead to either hierarchical or non hierarchical groups of individuals here following bloomfield et al 2015 the flexible k means clustering method is used to form a specified number of non hierarchical groups the k means approach also requires that a distance function is specified which is used to assess the difference between different sgi time series in this case the euclidean distance between the time series is used a numerical optimisation routine is used to select the partitioning of the boreholes which minimizes the difference between each sgi time series and the centroid of the time series for the cluster in which it is contained this procedure is repeated for two to nine groups and then expert interpretation is used to decide which number of groups is most suitable to reflect our understanding of the hydrogeological system the expert interpretation is guided by the following aims of the clustering to identify and so exclude from further analysis sites that are systematically influenced by anthropogenic effects or that are outliers where the sgi time series do not correlate with the driving climatology and that the remaining clusters are spatially coherent and represent regional variations in groundwater droughts in the chalk the approach adopted is to identify the smallest number of clusters that reasonably satisfies the aims of the clustering note that these aims or rules are specific to the current study however for any given study area the target number of classes and hence the rules used can be adapted to reflect the regional hydrogeology and in particular any knowledge of heterogeneity in the aquifer systems under investigation 4 4 spatial interpolation of the sgi time series geostatistical methods webster and oliver 2007 are used to spatially interpolate simulated sgi values on each date a spatial correlation function is estimated for the sgi values by the method of moments webster and oliver 2007 this approach calculates the semi variance i e half the squared difference between pairs of observations and then estimates a model of how the semi variance varies with the distance separating the boreholes at which the observations were made in common with the temporal analyses the nested nugget and matérn model eqs 7 and 8 is used this ensures that the resultant correlation matrices are positive definite and that the prediction variances that result are not negative when calculating the semi variances comparisons are restricted to pairs of sgi values from the same date and from boreholes where the gwl was recorded on that date this ensures that the temporal variation and the estimation variance of the sgi do not unduly influence our estimated semi variances having estimated the spatial correlation function sgi values are spatially interpolated on the first day of each month and the uncertainty of these predictions estimated by kriging webster and oliver 2007 the kriging predictor is applied 1000 times taking a different simulated sgi value from each borehole each time the sgi prediction at each unobserved site is equal to the mean prediction for these 1000 iterations the variance of the 1000 predictions is calculated at each site and added to the spatial kriging variance to yield the total prediction variance thus this prediction variance accounts for both spatial and temporal uncertainty although this approach does assume that the random effects from each borehole for a particular month are independent any location that is more than 75 km from a borehole is omitted from the region where predictions are calculated since the correlation between the gwls at such a site and the observed gwls will be small and hence the predictions unreliable 5 results 5 1 temporal modelling of sgi values the results of the temporal modelling procedure are illustrated for two boreholes denoted a and b in fig 1 right borehole a is an observation borehole from the interfluve area of the eastern chilterns and has a monthly sgi hydrograph that shows annual and multi annual responses to the driving meteorology and no clear annual minima whereas borehole b is an observation borehole from the northern part of the hampshire basin with a monthly sgi hydrograph that is dominated by an annual signal and a consistent annual minima typically just below 80 m above sea level masl associated with a local groundwater base level fig 5 shows the estimated irfs for these two boreholes the borehole a irf takes almost two years to reach its peak and precipitation is still having some influence on the gwls 40 months after it has occurred in contrast the irf for borehole b reaches its peak after five months and it is negligibly small after 20 months thus the modelled and observed gwls from borehole a vary relatively smoothly fig 6 upper panel whereas the gwls from borehole b fig 6 lower panel have a much flashier pattern of variation the 95 confidence limits in the predicted gwls fig 6 are determined from the values that are simulated from the estimated mixed model the confidence limits for borehole a are generally narrow although they widen during periods such as 1998 where few gwl observations are available similarly the predictions of gwls for borehole b are rather uncertain in the early 1960s since this time precedes the observation of gwls at this borehole the sgi and 95 confidence limits of the sgi for each borehole are shown in fig 7 again these are based on the simulated gwls and for borehole a they are relatively narrow except at times when the gwls were not observed the confidence limits for the flashier sgi time series from borehole b are much wider particularly at times when the observed data were sparse when applying the temporal analysis workflow fig 3 across all of the boreholes it was necessary to remove 28 outlying gwl observations which were inconsistent with the initial estimated model once these outliers had been removed and the models re fitted the resultant mean sspes for each borehole were generally close to 1 for 93 of the boreholes table 1 the mean of the sspe was between 0 9 and 1 1 indicating that the average observed squared errors upon cross validation were on within 10 of the predicted squared errors of the best fitting models for each of the 948 boreholes analysed 77 included an irf and hence a significant relationship with precipitation table 1 overall the best fitting models for all the sites explained an average of 52 of the variation in gwls and on average more than half of this was explained by the irf component 5 2 cluster analysis of sgi time series modelled gwls from the 948 boreholes were used as the basis for the cluster analysis and the spatial distribution of sites for between two and nine clusters are shown in fig 8 following the rules set for cluster selection the results are shown in figs 8f and fig 9 and seven clusters have been identified the centroids i e averages for the sgi time series for these seven clusters are shown in fig 10 the seven clusters include two clusters of modelled hydrographs that show long term trends and a poor explanation of observed variation in gwls fig 10 and table 1 are interpreted as reflecting long term anthropogenic influence on sgi time series namely o cluster 7 cl7 shows an upward trend from 1960 to 2013 fig 10 where only 41 of the best fitting models include the irf table 1 and only 21 of the gwl variation is explained by the model sites in this cluster are not spatially coherent and are interpreted as being affected by a range of anthropogenic influences including for example previously documented post industrial groundwater rebound in the confined chalk beneath the central london lucas and robinson 1995 fig 9c o cluster 3 cl3 shows a downward trend fig 10 where only 29 of the best fitting models include the irf table 1 and only 12 of the gwl variation is explained by the model sites in this cluster like those in cl7 are widely dispersed and are interpreted as being due to long term or historic over abstraction from the chalk for example as previously documented in lincolnshire whitehead and lawrence 2006 and cambridgeshire petts et al 1999 acreman et al 2000 fig 9c one cluster cluster 4 cl4 of modelled hydrographs shows no trend and a very poor explanation of observed variation in gwls table 1 and fig 9c this cluster is interpreted as corresponding to sites where there is insufficient evidence observations to model the gwl variation the remaining four clusters clusters 1 2 5 and 6 cl1 cl2 cl5 and cl6 respectively occupy broadly spatially coherent regions with cl1 coinciding with the berkshire and north wessex downs cl2 with yorkshire lincolnshire and north norfolk cl5 the south downs and wessex and cl6 coincides with the chilterns north downs and suffolk a high proportion of the models in each of these clusters include irf models and a high proportion of the variance of gwls is explained by the models table 1 sites in clusters cl7 cl3 and cl4 are not analysed further since they are considered to be either anthropogenically impacted cl7 and cl3 or the modelled gwls are inferred to be unrelated to precipitation cl4 the remaining four clusters cl1 cl2 cl5 and cl6 are taken to represent the broadly unimpacted responses of groundwater levels in the unconfined or partially confined aquifer to the driving meteorology as modified by catchment and aquifer characteristics and are the focus of subsequent analysis the average and standardised to a sum of one irfs for each of the four unimpacted clusters are shown in fig 11 the irf for cl1 and cl2 are very similar reaching a peak after about 7 months and becoming negligibly small after 40 months thus the sgi centroids for these two clusters fig 10 have a similar degree of smoothness the irf for cl5 immediately reaches its peak and decreases to be negligibly small soon after 20 months this behaviour is reflected by a much flashier sgi centroid in fig 10 conversely the irf from cl6 remains positive beyond 50 months corresponding to a very smooth sgi centroid for the four unimpacted clusters the vast majority of best fitting models include the irf table 1 and the models for cl1 cl2 and cl5 on average explain more than 65 of gwl variation this level of performance is comparable with that achieved using aquimod lumped parameter model jackson et al 2016 on average only 45 of the variation in the gwls is explained for cl6 boreholes but this is consistent with the findings of marchant et al 2016 that predictive performance is relatively poor for smoothly varying gwls the mean sspes are generally close to one for all of the clusters table 1 although the proportion of sites where the mean sspe is outside the range 0 9 1 1 is relatively large for the three impacted clusters and the more smoothly varying cl6 to understand what may be influencing the composition of the clusters including their temporal and spatial features it is helpful to consider both the precipitation time series associated with each sgi cluster and the spatial distribution of key catchment and hydrogeological factors fig 12 shows the mean normalised and standardised precipitation in the preceding 12 months spi12 bloomfield and marchant 2013 for clusters cl1 cl2 cl5 and cl6 fig 12 is consistent with the assumption that the broad drought history of the study area is spatially homogeneous time series of spi12 for each of the four clusters closely parallel the spi12 for the region as a whole and all four show the previously documented major episodes of drought 1975 1976 1988 1992 1995 1997 2004 2006 and 2010 2012 marsh et al 1994 marsh et al 2007 kendon et al 2013 bloomfield and marchant 2013 bloomfield et al 2015 although it is noted that two additional episodes of spi12 drought taken here as spi12 1 of a similar magnitude to previously recorded episodes of drought are also indicated for 1962 1966 and 1972 1973 there are however minor deviations in the spi12 time series between individual clusters and the region as a whole for example the 1975 1976 spi12 drought was more acute in cl1 centred on the southern chalk rather than in cl2 i e over the chalk of the north east the 1988 1992 event appears to have been both more acute and continuous in cl2 than in cl1 and cl5 where it was slightly less severe and consisted of three individual phases and the onset of the 2011 2012 drought appears to be slightly earlier in cl1 than the other three clusters fig 12 even though episodes of groundwater drought taken here as sgi 1 are more attenuated than the equivalent drought in the driving meteorology compare fig 10 with fig 12 and as would be expected from van loon 2015 the subtle differences in the driving meteorology are propagated through to and are reflected in similar differences in the sgi time series for example the sgi centroids for cl1 and cl2 are highly correlated fig 10 but some differences are evident the 1976 groundwater drought appears to be more severe for cl1 while the groundwater drought in the early 1990s is continuous for cl2 whereas in cl1 there is a small break and the 2010 2012 groundwater drought commences slightly earlier in cl1 based on the above it appears that small changes in the driving meteorology within the study area between cl2 in the north east of the study area and cl1 and cl5 in the south of the chalk have had some influence on the composition of the clusters the sgi centroids fig 10 represent an integrated system response to the driving meteorology however there are features of the four clusters and their expression of groundwater droughts that appear to be influenced by regional variation in unsaturated zone and recharge process and by some saturated zone and catchment characteristics sites in cl6 may be influenced by features of the regional hydrogeology that act to modify recharge and hence affect the form of the sgi hydrographs cl6 is associated with east anglia the chilterns and the north downs and is characterised by the smoothest of the sgi centroids fig 10 across large parts of east anglia the chalk is covered by the crag a series of younger gravels sands and silts and by glacial deposits jones et al 2000 weathering deposits in the form of clay with flints are also present extensively over the chalk of the chilterns and north downs goudie 1993 bloomfield et al 2009 the hydraulic relationship between these overlying deposits and the chalk is locally complex for example the crag may be in hydraulic continuity with the underlying chalk or may be separated from the chalk by a relatively low permeability clay jones et al 2000 where it is in hydraulic continuity it adds significantly to the storage of the aquifer where the basal clay is present the chalk may locally be confined over the chilterns and the north downs the clay with flints deposits another relatively low permeability clay is typically found on high ground across the main recharge area associated with cl6 here the clay with flints limits recharge but also leads to focused recharge at the margins of the deposit allen et al 1997 macdonald et al 1998 although locally complex in their hydrogeological effects at a regional scale these deposits that overly the chalk may either add significant storage to the chalk aquifer or limit or delay recharge in both instances these processes will contribute to the relatively smooth nature of the sgi centroid of cl6 fig 10 bloomfield and marchant 2013 have previously shown that the range of temporal autocorrelation in the sgi from a borehole scales with the hydraulic diffusivity of the aquifer consequently it could be expected that the spatially coherent sgi clusters fig 9b should reflect any spatial heterogeneity in transmissivity t and storativity s of the chalk at a regional scale macdonald and allen 2001 analysed the aquifer properties of the chalk based on 2100 pumping tests in four regions southern the thames basin including the north downs east anglia and yorkshire and lincolnshire but the results were inconclusive they found that the distribution of t and s was broadly similar for all four regions and that within a given region transmissivity and storage co efficients could vary by over five orders of magnitude however they also noted that the dataset was highly biased most pumping tests have been undertaken in valley areas where the yield of the chalk is highest and it is unclear how this may have influenced the results of the analysis of the t and s data the inference from these observations is that there appears to be no strong or reliable evidence for a relationship between t and s and the spatial distribution of the clusters notwithstanding this relationships between the location of the observation borehole catchment boundaries and local groundwater level base levels and hence unsaturated zone thickness will influence the form of the sgi time series peters et al 2006 bloomfield and marchant 2013 compared with the other three clusters catchments in wessex and the south downs associated with cl5 are typically relatively small and the chalk is relatively highly faulted and fractured compared with other regions jones and robins 1999 these observations are consistent with the relatively flashy nature of the cl5 sgi centroid compared with cl1 cl2 and cl6 fig 9 in summary it is not trivial to disentangle the various contributing factors to the form of the four sgi clusters however there is evidence that small changes in the driving meteorology between the north east of the study area and the south of the study area may have influenced the formation of clusters cl1 cl2 and cl5 that overlying deposits and their effect on unsaturated zone storage and recharge may have influenced the formation of cl6 and cl5 is consistent with known spatial variations in catchment and rock mass characteristics 5 3 spatial interpolation of sgi values the estimated spatial variogram function for the sgi predictions for all data in clusters cl1 cl2 cl5 and cl6 is shown in fig 13 the spatial variation is relatively smooth with little difference between sgi values a few km apart and there is some degree of spatial correlation beyond 100 km this is consistent with the spatial coherency of the clusters typically of the order of 100 200 km fig 9b using the spatial variogram function sgi values have been spatially interpolated for each month from january 1960 to march 2013 spatial interpolations of the sgi are shown for three major episodes of drought in fig 14 1975 1975 event fig 15 1988 1992 event and fig 16 2011 2012 event and reflect the observed differences between the sgi centroids for clusters cl1 cl2 cl5 and cl6 fig 10 in figs 14 16 the distribution of negative values of sgi in the chalk have been mapped where sgi 0 5 is denoted as pre drought 1 as groundwater drought 1 5 as a severe groundwater drought and 2 as an extreme groundwater drought comparison of figs 14 16 shows the unique spatio temporal nature of each episode of groundwater drought for example fig 14 shows that the 1975 1976 drought although national in extent at its peak in the summer of 1976 was most extreme in southern england hampshire and the berkshire downs consistent with previous observations of rodda and marsh 2011 the 2011 2012 groundwater drought fig 16 was also national in extent however it was less pronounced than the 1975 1976 event had a slightly more easterly footprint and at its height in late winter spring 2012 was most extreme in north norfolk and parts of the chilterns and berkshire consistent with the observations of marsh et al 2013 both the 1975 1976 and 2011 2012 episodes were effectively two winter groundwater droughts where in any given region the drought status grew continuously over the entire period to a maximum and then declined as the drought broke marsh et al 2013 however in contrast to both these episodes the 1988 1992 event was a longer multi annual event and is characterised by waves of increasing and decreasing groundwater drought status throughout the longer period for example fig 15 shows yorkshire and parts of hampshire passing into and back out of drought severe drought status before finally reaching peak drought status in spring summer 1992 compared with both the 1975 1976 and 2011 2012 droughts at its peak the 1988 1992 groundwater drought was more extensive across the whole of the english chalk however both before and after peak drought status see march 1992 fig 15 the episode generally had a more north easterly focus than the other two episodes of drought marsh et al 1994 6 discussion the empirical approach adopted here successfully meets the challenges of assessing the severity and distribution of groundwater droughts while explicitly addressing issues associated with the availability and nature of gwl data and also accounting for and quantifying the spatio temporal heterogeneity of episodes of drought the empirical approach uses available gwl data for a region in this case for the chalk of the uk and requires no additional information other than precipitation data it does not need any process based assumptions to be made and the models do not require parameterisation using information about site characteristics as a consequence it is not necessary to have additional information about the spatial variation in catchment or hydrogeological characteristics over the modelled region this means that the approach is applicable for use in monitoring and assessing groundwater drought status wherever there are suitable available gwl observations and precipitation data the approach is more parsimonious with respect to the number of parameters that need to be calibrated than aquimod a process based lumped model while at the same time the performance of the empirical model has been shown to be comparable with that achieved using aquimod jackson et al 2016 the modelling scheme figs 3 and 4 takes gwl time series data however irregular or noisy and through sub sampling and modelling transforms these into regular monthly modelled gwl time series that can be correlated with precipitation data to estimate sgi and hence groundwater drought status in this scheme as with previous studies khan et al 2008 bloomfield and marchant 2013 bloomfield et al 2015 kumar et al 2016 van loon et al 2017 precipitation is used as a proxy for groundwater drought status however the mixed model differs from and is an improvement on those previous studies that use proxies in two main ways by using an irf calver 1997 von asmuth et al 2002 the empirical approach accounts for non linearities in the relationship between precipitation and groundwater levels in addition the method explicitly quantifies the uncertainty in both the modelled site and spatial groundwater drought status fig 7 fig 17 shows spatial variation of the sgi prediction variance i e uncertainty across the chalk for november 1962 and november 2012 the average prediction variances across the chalk are 0 17 in november 1962 and 0 14 in november 2012 this difference reflects the greater number of groundwater observations in 2012 spatially the uncertainty increases with distance from the nearest borehole van lanen et al 2016 laaha et al 2017 and van loon et al 2017 have each provided assessments of and commentaries on the last major european drought in 2015 van loon et al 2017 note that there is a need to promote more long term groundwater measurement and international sharing of groundwater level data we re emphasise this need data driven models of drought status such as the one described here require relatively long term time series data across wide geographical areas to adequately represent variations in spatio temporal status of groundwater droughts laaha et al 2017 point out that a particular failing of hydrological assessments during the european drought of 2015 was the inability to obtain and analyse data in near real time in that context any models of hydrological status that are calibrated on precipitation data which is available in near real time and that can be used in a nowcasting mode or for short term forecasts of drought status for example out to one or two months would be highly valuable although outside the scope of the present study the empirical model described here is amenable to be used in such a manner the precision of these forecasts in a particular region will greatly depend upon the degree of temporal autocorrelation amongst the observed gwls in nearby boreholes van lanen et al 2016 noted that during droughts such as that in europe in 2015 groundwater resources are stressed not just due to precipitation deficits but also due to over abstraction and that typically no separation is made between impacts due to the drought itself as compared to abstractions due to increased groundwater exploitation this observation has been further developed by van loon et al 2016 in their analysis of drought in the anthropocene although not the focus of the current study the modelling approach adopted here lends itself well to identification of the impacts of abstraction on groundwater droughts because the modelling does not rely on process based assumptions of the hydrogeology at each site it is easy to identify the degree to which variation in groundwater levels can be explained by variations in precipitation alone where it is not possible for the model to explain groundwater levels adequately it is reasonable to postulate that in many cases the effects of abstraction may be significant at that site for example in the present study sites in clusters cl3 and cl7 have been inferred to be affected by long term changes in groundwater management with cluster cl3 interpreted as showing evidence of long term abstraction extracting episodes of drought from hydrographs from cl3 where historic over abstraction has previously been documented e g whitehead and lawrence 2006 and systematically analysing these in the context of equivalent hydrographs from cluster cl2 hydrographs from the same region but that show no influence of long term abstraction figs 9 and 10 should provide new insights into the effects of long term abstraction on the onset magnitude and duration groundwater drought acknowledgements we would like to thank mark whiteman as well as staff at the crowmarsh gifford office of the environment agency for

7077,green roofs are valuable solutions for rain management improvements in urban areas as they can partly store and delay rainfall water here we point out that green roofs cannot be considered as static systems which performances remain constant over time this work is based on the cross use of a lab scale experiment and a modelling approach to evaluate the hydraulic performances of a green roof substrate over time experiments were conducted on new and aged materials after 30 months of in situ aging the experimental device was designed and implemented to simulate irrigation or rainfall and accurately monitor hydraulic fluxes an estimation of hydraulic parameters was obtained by using inverse modelling of experimental data with hydrus 1d software comparisons between measured and modelled data demonstrated the reliability of the model for simulating the hydraulic behavior of the green roofs considering an incoming water event which mimics a heavy rainfall of 43 mm h 1 and similar water content initial conditions our simulations indicate that the retention capacity and the delay effect were always higher for the new substrate than for the aged one both of these performance indicators strongly vary with the initial water content of the substrates whereas the relation is linear for the retention capacity ranging from 100 of retention for the drier conditions to 0 for the saturated substrates it is more complex for the delay effect such performances were comparable to analogous data from the existing literature furthermore this comparison confirmed that green roofs are submitted to an early aging in terms of structure i e porosity in our study the aged substrate presented less favorable performances thus highlighting the key role of the composition

pozzolana aggregates extracted in the volcanic region of massif central have a wide range of uses including the creation of green roof substrates such a material exhibits interesting properties such

called new substrate s0 because it was never exposed to climatic aging and the second sample is called evolved substrate s30 s30 was sampled 30 months after implementation on an in situ gr located in nancy france n48 41 11 8716 e6 13 7 0716 which exhibits a temperate climate without dry seasons class cfb according to the köppen geiger classification s30 was collected with roots and vegetation preserving the organization of each layer and then stored in a container before further lab experiments a bottom layer geotextile is used to prevent the leaching of the substrate it was a thin synthetic non woven polyester geotextile about 2 mm with apparent opening size about 90 µm 2 2 solid characterizations bulk density ρa was measured by filling and weighting the substrate in a stainless steel cylinder h 30 cm ø 20 cm in accordance with the nf en 12 580 norm real solid density ρr was measured on three replicates using a helium pycnometer micromeritics accupyc 1130 total porosity δ was then calculated after eq 1 1 δ 1 ρ a ρ r where ρa and ρr are respectively apparent and real soil density kg m 3 2 3 experimental setup a specific experimental device dedicated to water measurements in gr was built fig 1 the setup was made of a plexiglas box filled with three layers of a gr plants only on s30 a 140 mm thick substrate layer s0 or s30 and geotextile a 5 cm sand layer was used to homogenize and level off the incoming water on the substrate surface which was considered similar as a rain event qin water content in the substrate was followed using two water content probes decagon 5tm range 0 100 accuracy 2 using tdr technology they were inserted 50 mm below the surface percolating water qout was collected by a 200 mm diameter tube and continuously weighted by a balance avery weigh tronix range 0 25 kg accuracy 1 g a computer stored all the data with a sampling time of 1 s for the outgoing water and of 1 min for the water content sensors for each substrate the experiment consisted in five water injections equivalent to a total height of 43 mm four 8 mm at times 5 min 15 min 25 min and 45 min and 11 mm at 35 min initial experiment time was defined when water fell on the first layer this rain sequence did not intend to represent a moderate rain event but mimics extreme though realistic conditions to which a gr can be exposed and that would lead to a significant outflow buccola and spolek 2011 as the experimental device was covered and the length of the experiment was short the processes of water uptake by roots and evapotranspiration were neglected 2 4 performance evaluation the water balance terms in mm h 1 at the gr scale can be expressed as the sum of i incoming water qin ii water stored in the substrate and the vegetation δs during

combination with the mualem model for hydraulic conductivity curve eqs 4 6 mualem 1976 were used to model water flows 3 θ h θ r θ s θ r 1 α h n m h 0 θ s h 0 4 k s e k s s e l 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 where 5 s e θ h θ r θ s θ r and 6 m 1 1 n n 1 the upper boundary condition at the soil air interface was set as atmospheric boundary conditions with runoff the lower boundary condition was set as seepage face h 0 2 6 estimation of hydraulic parameters the hydrus 1d model šimůnek et al 2008 which includes a parameter optimization module was used to solve the water flow in the experimental device based on methods similar to previous works kelleners et al 2005 durner et al 2008 the initial conditions were set at the water content values measured by tdr probes at t0 two distinct objective functions were computed boundary flux at the bottom of the experimental device and the water content measured in the substrate the parameter estimation process described by šimůnek et al 2008 was applied to soil hydraulic parameters θr θs ks α n l respectively saturated soil water content residual soil water content saturated hydraulic conductivity two parameters in the soil water retention function tortuosity parameter in the conductivity function without any internal weighting but with a maximum of 20 iterations 2 7 reliability of fit estimation two indicators were used to qualify the reliability of fit between experimental and simulated values the nse is commonly used to quantitatively assess the accuracy of a hydrological model in reproducing the output flow nash and sutcliffe 1970 this index can vary from to 1 1 being a perfect fit if nse 0 the simulation is as accurate as the mean of the experimental data and a negative value indicates that the simulated outflow is far from the mean value of the observed data the nrmsd function was also used it expresses in a more readable way the errors between observed and simulated data the closer nrmsd is to zero the better the simulation is 3 results and discussion 3 1 direct measurements of physical properties measured substrate and geotextile physical characteristics are summarized in table 1 the geotextile is a very porous medium 86 for which solid and bulk densities are both very small this is consistent with a polyester composition the physical properties of s0 correspond to expected functions of low weight and high retention capacity with respectively a very low bulk density 800 kg m 3 and notably high porosity 72 it has a rather high solid density 2840 kg m 3 compared to natural soils average value 2650 kg m 3 indeed this crushed volcanic material is made of heavy compounds siliceous pyroclastic minerals and has a high porosity small decreases of all parameters were observed for s30 substrate reflecting a marked if not significant evolution of the aged substrate de ville et al 2015 already showed that the properties of gr substrates do change as a result of aging in our study such changes may be explained by the migration and loss of fine particles inside the substrate as already discussed in bouzouidja et al 2018 3 2 hydraulic behavior during the rain simulation experiment the evolution of the volumetric water content in s0 followed three distinct stages fig 3 a between 5 and 15 min the moisture increased sharply and continuously from 0 12 m3 m 3 to 0 27 m3 m 3 this pattern was reproduced between 15 and 60 min with a sharp increase of moisture content over the first minute after the injection followed by a slow decrease until the next injection the local maxima value reached 0 46 m3 m 3 after 60 min and the last injection a plateau value was progressively reached θend 0 38 m3 m 3 as the initial water content was low only the last event induced an outflow event of 5 1 mm at 46 min fig 3b in view of the experimental design the outflow occurred only when the bottom part of the substrate became fully saturated with water as this interface is in contact with the atmosphere the s30 substrate behaved differently with an initial water content of 0 21 m3 m 3 the first injection led directly to a sharp increase of water content that reached a local maximum of 0 34 m3 m 3 at 6 min followed by a slow decrease fig 4 a as for the s0 substrate the next injections reproduced this same pattern in this case the highest volumetric water content of 0 38 m3 m 3 was reached after the fourth injection at 36 min its value was significantly lower than for the s0 substrate after the last injection the water content decreased to reach a plateau θend 0 26 m3 m 3 also lower than for the s0 substrate three water outflow events were observed at 28 36 and 47 min reaching a cumulative out flow of 26 mm fig 4b the processes that control the retention on a gr entirely both depend on the hydraulic discontinuity induced by the transition between geotextile and the drainage layer atmospheric conditions and on the ability of the substrate to store water in our experiments the differences observed between both substrates rely on two factors their different initial volumetric water content and their respective physical and hydraulic properties the first stages were a priori mostly governed by initial volumetric water content in that respect the fact that s30 was wetter than s0 could explain the faster water breakthrough observed after the first rain injection the impact of the hydraulic substrate properties was more difficult to differentiate thus a modelling approach was used to estimate hydraulic properties on the one hand and to simulate functioning under similar initial conditions for both substrates on the other hand 3 3 estimation of hydraulic parameters from the experiments on s0 and s30 two sets of hydraulic parameters were computed table 2 the differences between the two parameters sets reflected significant evolution of the porosity of the substrate over time some explicit evolutions were computed notably the 4 decrease of the saturated water content from s0 to s30 and the 22 increase of the saturated hydraulic conductivity from s0 to s30 there is a significant decrease of the moisture at the field capacity content with the age of the substrate for s0 θ3 3m 0 12 and for s30 θ3 3m 0 08 as shown by the retention curves fig 5 the evaluation of hydraulic parameters of both initial and evolved substrates suggests an early pedogenesis of the gr only two years and a half after its implementation we already pointed out such evidences of an evolution of properties due to aging such as the modification of the pore size distribution bouzouidja et al 2018 the possible processes that were involved are i potential vertical transfer of particles and accumulation at the bottom of the substrate but also in the geotextile itself as it was mentioned by schwager et al 2015 ii filling of pores by roots iii creation of associations between organic and mineral particles iv increase of the bulk density resulting from settling of the substrate over time for example macivor and lundholm 2011 reported that vegetation roots development causes the substrate restructuring its upper part was highly colonized by roots which led to an increase in fresh organic matter which is consistent with the decrease of solid density similarly to us schrader and boening 2006 described the settling down of gr substrate 3 4 water transport modelling for s0 the simulation reproduced the global dynamics of the volumetric water content even though the numerical values significantly differed with a systematic underestimate fig 3a even if some major differences were noticed the reliability indicator values indicated a correct accuracy of the model to simulate water content nrmsd 0 08 the cumulative outflow reached the experimental value 5 1 mm but with a slight delay nse 0 91 fig 3b the simulation of volumetric water content during the s30 experiment reproduced the evolution of the volumetric water content over the experiment duration fig 4a as demonstrated by the very low values of nrmsd 0 06 even if the decreases were sometimes greater than observed the modelling of water outflow was accurate nse 0 95 fig 4b it can be noticed that the hydraulic behaviors of both substrates in terms of cumulative outflow were properly described by the modelling approach this original result can be positively compared to the drained water over prediction of previous studies hilten et al 2008 regarding the peak flow rate palla et al 2009 found that their model underestimates the observed value brunetti et al 2016 found that the van genuchten model was able to accurately describe the hydraulic behavior of the green roof with a sufficient score statistic nse 0 74 but failed in reproducing small outflows after rain and irrigation 3 5 water retention performances as a function of age and initial water content in order to compare water retention performances between the new substrate and the aged one a simulation was conducted fig 6 considering the same initial water content θini 0 11 m3 m 3 for s0 but with the hydraulic parameters previously adjusted for each substrate with the lab experiment data table 2 with these theoretical initial conditions the total simulated water outflow was significantly higher for s30 than for s0 qout respectively 11 5 mm and 4 6 mm in that case the retention capacity was 89 9 for s0 and 73 10 for s30 on the contrary the delay effect was significantly higher for s0 than for s30 td respectively 46 1 min and 36 2 min as the water was drained faster on the aged substrate these results unequivocally suggest that the water retention performances of gr substrate decreased overtime in the first years after its implementation such an assertion is supported by the changes in the physical and hydraulic parameters as they were measured and optimized in this study on analogous lab scale conditions buccola and spolek 2011 studied how soil depth and root zone development affects storm water flow through for each plant type they measured on a 14 cm substrate depth rc values of 56 12 and 64 30 respectively for a heavy 340 mm h 1 and a medium 16 mm h 1 rainstorms the authors showed that the depth of green roof soil layer as well as the composition of vegetation greatly influenced the water retention and release from the system on the other hand our results strongly contrast with previous work regarding the influence of gr ageing on hydraulic performances on an in situ large scale long term experiment getter et al 2007 reported an increase of rc over 5 years from 17 on the new substrate to 67 on the aged one speak et al 2013 explained that the age of the roof does not appear to have an impact on the retention ability of the gr even if the water holding capacity has drastically declined over a year a recent work demonstrated an increased water holding capacity and potential for retention performance with age of two green roof substrates de ville et al 2017 2018 such discrepancies between studies may be explained by the different nature of the constituents of the substrates that were used indeed de ville et al 2017 2018 worked on a crushed brick based substrate and a light expanded clay aggregate based substrate the present study was conducted on a pozzolana aggregate based substrate thus the composition of the substrate appears to play a key role on gr hydraulic performances however such hydraulic performances measured under various situations are hard to compare indeed the initial water content of the gr substrate is recognized to have a strong influence on its retention capacity during short time events hakimdavar et al 2014 hilten et al 2008 to overcome such variability the modelling approach is promising we conducted a series of simulations with hydrus 1d by varying the initial water content of each substrate s0 and s30 from θr to θs and then calculated and provided for both the retention capacity and the delay time fig 7 relationship between rc and θini is broadly linear for both substrates fig 7a the variations as a function of the initial water content are very strong ranging from 3 8 to 100 for s0 and from 0 to 87 3 for s30 logically there is a constant and rather large gap between s0 and s30 14 6 0 5 which is independent from the initial water content this additional result strengthens the above findings the shapes of the curves of delay time are step graphs for both substrates fig 7b due to the punctual and repeated injections of water in a short period once again the initial water content appears to play a key role on this hydraulic performance indicator as following our experimental protocol the delay times vary from 0 to 42 min it is also globally affected by the age of the substrate even if some similar initial water content lead to similar delay time for both substrates on each step 4 conclusion a lab scale experimental device has been designed and built to measure the retention capacity and delay effects of gr for short and heavy rain events under controlled conditions the contribution of the vegetation to evapotranspiration processes was not taken into account in addition physical modelling led to an accurate way to simulate water transfer inside and out of a gr this approach is very promising as it could be transposed to almost any type of gr using representative climatic data i e rainfall and evapotranspiration to estimate its hydraulic performances by taking also into account such crucial parameter as initial water content our results are conform with the literature demonstrating the efficient contribution of gr to store and delay rainwater in cities we confirmed a new aging hypothesis that emerged recently that suggests some variations of the hydraulic properties of gr over time under the effect of vegetation and climate that affect their performances besides this work contributes to strongly highlight the major influence of the composition of the substrate not only on the initial hydraulic performances but also on their aging over time further studies would also require an upscaling to take into account the vegetation contribution on a longer term in both cases some models and expertise can be found in soil physics and transposed to the study of such an original porous media as gr acknowledgements this work was

7077,green roofs are valuable solutions for rain management improvements in urban areas as they can partly store and delay rainfall water here we point out that green roofs cannot be considered as static systems which performances remain constant over time this work is based on the cross use of a lab scale experiment and a modelling approach to evaluate the hydraulic performances of a green roof substrate over time experiments were conducted on new and aged materials after 30 months of in situ aging the experimental device was designed and implemented to simulate irrigation or rainfall and accurately monitor hydraulic fluxes an estimation of hydraulic parameters was obtained by using inverse modelling of experimental data with hydrus 1d software comparisons between measured and modelled data demonstrated the reliability of the model for simulating the hydraulic behavior of the green roofs considering an incoming water event which mimics a heavy rainfall of 43 mm h 1 and similar water content initial conditions our simulations indicate that the retention capacity and the delay effect were always higher for the new substrate than for the aged one both of these performance indicators strongly vary with the initial water content of the substrates whereas the relation is linear for the retention capacity ranging from 100 of retention for the drier conditions to 0 for the saturated substrates it is more complex for the delay effect such performances were comparable to analogous data from the existing literature furthermore this comparison confirmed that green roofs are submitted to an early aging in terms of structure i e porosity in our study the aged substrate presented less favorable performances thus highlighting the key role of the composition

synthetic non woven polyester geotextile about 2 mm with apparent opening size about 90 µm 2 2 solid characterizations bulk density ρa was measured by filling and weighting the substrate in a stainless steel cylinder h 30 cm ø 20 cm in accordance with the nf en 12 580 norm real solid density ρr was measured on three replicates using a helium pycnometer micromeritics accupyc 1130 total porosity δ was then calculated after eq 1 1 δ 1 ρ a ρ r where ρa and ρr are respectively apparent and real soil density kg m 3 2 3 experimental setup a specific experimental device dedicated to water measurements in gr was built fig 1 the setup was made of a plexiglas box filled with three layers of a gr plants only on s30 a 140 mm thick substrate layer s0 or s30 and geotextile a 5 cm sand layer was used to homogenize and level off the incoming water on the substrate surface which was considered similar as a rain event qin water content in the substrate was followed using two water content probes decagon 5tm range 0 100 accuracy 2 using tdr technology they were inserted 50 mm below the surface percolating water qout was collected by a 200 mm diameter tube and continuously weighted by a balance avery weigh tronix range 0 25 kg accuracy 1 g a computer stored all the data with a sampling time of 1 s for the outgoing water and of 1 min for the water content sensors for each substrate the experiment consisted in five water injections equivalent to a total height of 43 mm four 8 mm at times 5 min 15 min 25 min and 45 min and 11 mm at 35 min initial experiment time was defined when water fell on the first layer this rain sequence did not intend to represent a moderate rain event but mimics extreme though realistic conditions to which a gr can be exposed and that would lead to a significant outflow buccola and spolek 2011 as the experimental device was covered and the length of the experiment was short the processes of water uptake by roots and evapotranspiration were neglected 2 4 performance evaluation the water balance terms in mm h 1 at the gr scale can be expressed as the sum of i incoming water qin ii water stored in the substrate and the vegetation δs during the whole duration of the event and iii evapotranspiration et iii the drainage or out coming water qout this experiment is designed to avoid evaporation and evapotranspiration phenomena by using a closed setup a short experiment time 2 h and an air moisture close to saturation the times considered here are ti the start time of the rain event tb the start time for the drainage and tf the final

combination with the mualem model for hydraulic conductivity curve eqs 4 6 mualem 1976 were used to model water flows 3 θ h θ r θ s θ r 1 α h n m h 0 θ s h 0 4 k s e k s s e l 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 where 5 s e θ h θ r θ s θ r and 6 m 1 1 n n 1 the upper boundary condition at the soil air interface was set as atmospheric boundary conditions with runoff the lower boundary condition was set as seepage face h 0 2 6 estimation of hydraulic parameters the hydrus 1d model šimůnek et al 2008 which includes a parameter optimization module was used to solve the water flow in the experimental device based on methods similar to previous works kelleners et al 2005 durner et al 2008 the initial conditions were set at the water content values measured by tdr probes at t0 two distinct objective functions were computed boundary flux at the bottom of the experimental device and the water content measured in the substrate the parameter estimation process described by šimůnek et al 2008 was applied to soil hydraulic parameters θr θs ks α n l respectively saturated soil water content residual soil water content saturated hydraulic conductivity two parameters in the soil water retention function tortuosity parameter in the conductivity function without any internal weighting but with a maximum of 20 iterations 2 7 reliability of fit estimation two indicators were used to qualify the reliability of fit between experimental and simulated values the nse is commonly used to quantitatively assess the accuracy of a hydrological model in reproducing the output flow nash and sutcliffe 1970 this index can vary from to 1 1 being a perfect fit if nse 0 the simulation is as accurate as the mean of the experimental data and a negative value indicates that the simulated outflow is far from the mean value of the observed data the nrmsd function was also used it expresses in a more readable way the errors between observed and simulated data the closer nrmsd is to zero the better the simulation is 3 results and discussion 3 1 direct measurements of physical properties measured substrate and geotextile physical characteristics are summarized in table 1 the geotextile is a very porous medium 86 for which solid and bulk densities are both very small this is consistent with a polyester composition the physical properties of s0 correspond to expected functions of low weight and high retention capacity with respectively a very low bulk density 800 kg m 3 and notably high porosity 72 it has a rather high solid density 2840 kg m 3 compared to natural soils average value 2650 kg m 3 indeed this crushed volcanic material is made of heavy compounds siliceous pyroclastic minerals and has a high porosity small decreases of all parameters were observed for s30 substrate reflecting a marked if not significant evolution of the aged substrate de ville et al 2015 already showed that the properties of gr substrates do change as a result of aging in our study such changes may be explained by the migration and loss of fine particles inside the substrate as already discussed in bouzouidja et al 2018 3 2 hydraulic behavior during the rain simulation experiment the evolution of the volumetric water content in s0 followed three distinct stages fig 3 a between 5 and 15 min the moisture increased sharply and continuously from 0 12 m3 m 3 to 0 27 m3 m 3 this pattern was reproduced between 15 and 60 min with a sharp increase of moisture content over the first minute after the injection followed by a slow decrease until the next injection the local maxima value reached 0 46 m3 m 3 after 60 min and the last injection a plateau value was progressively reached θend 0 38 m3 m 3 as the initial water content was low only the last event induced an outflow event of 5 1 mm at 46 min fig 3b in view of the experimental design the outflow occurred only when the bottom part of the substrate became fully saturated with water as this interface is in contact with the atmosphere the s30 substrate behaved differently with an initial water content of 0 21 m3 m 3 the first injection led directly to a sharp increase of water content that reached a local maximum of 0 34 m3 m 3 at 6 min followed by a slow decrease fig 4 a as for the s0 substrate the next injections reproduced this same pattern in this case the highest volumetric water content of 0 38 m3 m 3 was reached after the fourth injection at 36 min its value was significantly lower than for the s0 substrate after the last injection the water content decreased to reach a plateau θend 0 26 m3 m 3 also lower than for the s0 substrate three water outflow events were observed at 28 36 and 47 min reaching a cumulative out flow of 26 mm fig 4b the processes that control the retention on a gr entirely both depend on the hydraulic discontinuity induced by the transition between geotextile and the drainage layer atmospheric conditions and on the ability of the substrate to store water in our experiments the differences observed between both substrates rely on two factors their different initial volumetric water content and their respective physical and hydraulic properties the first stages were a priori mostly governed by initial volumetric water content in that respect the fact that s30 was wetter than s0 could explain the faster water breakthrough observed after the first rain injection the impact of the hydraulic substrate properties was more difficult to differentiate thus a modelling approach was used to estimate hydraulic properties on the one hand and to simulate functioning under similar initial conditions for both substrates on the other hand 3 3 estimation of hydraulic parameters from the experiments on s0 and s30 two sets of hydraulic parameters were computed table 2 the differences between the two parameters sets reflected significant evolution of the porosity of the substrate over time some explicit evolutions were computed notably the 4 decrease of the saturated water content from s0 to s30 and the 22 increase of the saturated hydraulic conductivity from s0 to s30 there is a significant decrease of the moisture at the field capacity content with the age of the substrate for s0 θ3 3m 0 12 and for s30 θ3 3m 0 08 as shown by the retention curves fig 5 the evaluation of hydraulic parameters of both initial and evolved substrates suggests an early pedogenesis of the gr only two years and a half after its implementation we already pointed out such evidences of an evolution of properties due to aging such as the modification of the pore size distribution bouzouidja et al 2018 the possible processes that were involved are i potential vertical transfer of particles and accumulation at the bottom of the substrate but also in the geotextile itself as it was mentioned by schwager et al 2015 ii filling of pores by roots iii creation of associations between organic and mineral particles iv increase of the bulk density resulting from settling of the substrate over time for example macivor and lundholm 2011 reported that vegetation roots development causes the substrate restructuring its upper part was highly colonized by roots which led to an increase in fresh organic matter which is consistent with the decrease of solid density similarly to us schrader and boening 2006 described the settling down of gr substrate 3 4 water transport modelling for s0 the simulation reproduced the global dynamics of the volumetric water content even though the numerical values significantly differed with a systematic underestimate fig 3a even if some major differences were noticed the reliability indicator values indicated a correct accuracy of the model to simulate water content nrmsd 0 08 the cumulative outflow reached the experimental value 5 1 mm but with a slight delay nse 0 91 fig 3b the simulation of volumetric water content during the s30 experiment reproduced the evolution of the volumetric water content over the experiment duration fig 4a as demonstrated by the very low values of nrmsd 0 06 even if the decreases were sometimes greater than observed the modelling of water outflow was accurate nse 0 95 fig 4b it can be noticed that the hydraulic behaviors of both substrates in terms of cumulative outflow were properly described by the modelling approach this original result can be positively compared to the drained water over prediction of previous studies hilten et al 2008 regarding the peak flow rate palla et al 2009 found that their model underestimates the observed value brunetti et al 2016 found that the van genuchten model was able to accurately describe the hydraulic behavior of the green roof with a sufficient score statistic nse 0 74 but failed in reproducing small outflows after rain and irrigation 3 5 water retention performances as a function of age and initial water content in order to compare water retention performances between the new substrate and the aged one a simulation was conducted fig 6 considering the same initial water content θini 0 11 m3 m 3 for s0 but with the hydraulic parameters previously adjusted for each substrate with the lab experiment data table 2 with these theoretical initial conditions the total simulated water outflow was significantly higher for s30 than for s0 qout respectively 11 5 mm and 4 6 mm in that case the retention capacity was 89 9 for s0 and 73 10 for s30 on the contrary the delay effect was significantly higher for s0 than for s30 td respectively 46 1 min and 36 2 min as the water was drained faster on the aged substrate these results unequivocally suggest that the water retention performances of gr substrate decreased overtime in the first years after its implementation such an assertion is supported by the changes in the physical and hydraulic parameters as they were measured and optimized in this study on analogous lab scale conditions buccola and spolek 2011 studied how soil depth and root zone development affects storm water flow through for each plant type they measured on a 14 cm substrate depth rc values of 56 12 and 64 30 respectively for a heavy 340 mm h 1 and a medium 16 mm h 1 rainstorms the authors showed that the depth of green roof soil layer as well as the composition of vegetation greatly influenced the water retention and release from the system on the other hand our results strongly contrast with previous work regarding the influence of gr ageing on hydraulic performances on an in situ large scale long term experiment getter et al 2007 reported an increase of rc over 5 years from 17 on the new substrate to 67 on the aged one speak et al 2013 explained that the age of the roof does not appear to have an impact on the retention ability of the gr even if the water holding capacity has drastically declined over a year a recent work demonstrated an increased water holding capacity and potential for retention performance with age of two green roof substrates de ville et al 2017 2018 such discrepancies between studies may be explained by the different nature of the constituents of the substrates that were used indeed de ville et al 2017 2018 worked on a crushed brick based substrate and a light expanded clay aggregate based substrate the present study was conducted on a pozzolana aggregate based substrate thus the composition of the substrate appears to play a key role on gr hydraulic performances however such hydraulic performances measured under various situations are hard to compare indeed the initial water content of the gr substrate is recognized to have a strong influence on its retention capacity during short time events hakimdavar et al 2014 hilten et al 2008 to overcome such variability the modelling approach is promising we conducted a series of simulations with hydrus 1d by varying the initial water content of each substrate s0 and s30 from θr to θs and then calculated and provided for both the retention capacity and the delay time fig 7 relationship between rc and θini is broadly linear for both substrates fig 7a the variations as a function of the initial water content are very strong ranging from 3 8 to 100 for s0 and from 0 to 87 3 for s30 logically there is a constant and rather large gap between s0 and s30 14 6 0 5 which is independent from the initial water content this additional result strengthens the above findings the shapes of the curves of delay time are step graphs for both substrates fig 7b due to the punctual and repeated injections of water in a short period once again the initial water content appears to play a key role on this hydraulic performance indicator as following our experimental protocol the delay times vary from 0 to 42 min it is also globally affected by the age of the substrate even if some similar initial water content lead to similar delay time for both substrates on each step 4 conclusion a lab scale experimental device has been designed and built to measure the retention capacity and delay effects of gr for short and heavy rain events under controlled conditions the contribution of the vegetation to evapotranspiration processes was not taken into account in addition physical modelling led to an accurate way to simulate water transfer inside and out of a gr this approach is very promising as it could be transposed to almost any type of gr using representative climatic data i e rainfall and evapotranspiration to estimate its hydraulic performances by taking also into account such crucial parameter as initial water content our results are conform with the literature demonstrating the efficient contribution of gr to store and delay rainwater in cities we confirmed a new aging hypothesis that emerged recently that suggests some variations of the hydraulic properties of gr over time under the effect of vegetation and climate that affect their performances besides this work contributes to strongly highlight the major influence of the composition of the substrate not only on the initial hydraulic performances but also on their aging over time further studies would also require an upscaling to take into account the vegetation contribution on a longer term in both cases some models and expertise can be found in soil physics and transposed to the study of such an original porous media as gr acknowledgements this work was

7078,changes in hydrological processes in large watersheds may heavily impact the dynamics of downstream aquatic ecosystems such as lakes and reservoirs in general simple approaches that neglect the spatial heterogeneity of watersheds impede understanding of the many processes occurring in these downstream aquatic ecosystems in most cases observed river discharges are used as the boundary condition for lake reservoir modeling which limits analyses of different situations and of areas that are ungauged or water bodies with little data available therefore coupling hydrological models with hydrodynamic models seems to be a promising approach to allow one to understand how catchment features e g land use topography and river discharges impact the dynamic patterns including local circulation patterns water levels and water quality in large water bodies in response to basin wide forcing factors in this study we used a complex spatially explicit integrated approach to assess the hydrological responses to external forcing factors such as wind and river discharges in the hydrodynamics of a large shallow subtropical lake a large scale integrated system composed of several sub watersheds and a lake was analyzed by coupling a large scale hydrological model with a hydrodynamic model our findings indicated that i the integrated model improved the capacity for representing the spatial and temporal variability of lake water surface levels ii the main hydrodynamic processes water levels and flow structure are controlled on a seasonal scale months by the river discharges and on a short time scale days by wind influence intensity and direction and iii the modeling strategy allowed evaluation of anthropogenic stressors such as irrigation withdrawals on lake levels this approach is an attempt to develop a physically based management model to simulate complex systems as a whole allowing one to understand the main factors controlling the hydrodynamic processes and

and kercher 2005 many of these waterbodies are threatened by changes in hydrological processes in upland basins human activities and climate change leading to significant variations in both the water level and hydrodynamic balance jones et al 2001 legesse et al 2004 carpenter et al 1992 casanova and brock 2000 these variations in water volume play a crucial role in physical processes environmental impacts and socio economic implications such as shoreline damage from episodes of high water levels foulds 1977 meadows et al 1997 and water quality issues during periods of low water levels wildman et al 2011 khan et al 2015 in addition for lakes and reservoirs it is important to understand the catchment and hydrodynamic processes that will control the aquatic ecosystem dynamics such as phytoplankton spatial heterogeneity sediment transport and density currents e g pinardi et al 2015 curtarelli et al 2015 qi et al 2016 the main inputs of water for reservoirs lagoons and lakes located in the downstream portion of large watersheds are the rivers that discharge directly into these ecosystems only a few studies have explored the mathematical modeling of catchment lake dynamics considering the behavior of both the watershed and the lake often lake modeling studies use approaches that consider only the lake itself without modeling the catchment where the hydrological processes occur in addition the majority of lake modeling studies have focused mainly on hydrodynamics and or water quality dynamics e g fernandes et al 2001 2002 2005 marques et al 2009 barros et al 2014 li et al 2017 seiler et al 2015 xue et al 2015 in these studies the inflows from river discharge to the lake were considered only at specific locations and were limited to observed data with limited temporal frequency since the river discharges were not properly represented the capacity to analyze different management scenarios and spatially explicit dynamic patterns e g mixing regime hydrodynamic patterns and relative importance of the river discharge to the overall water balance is limited in recent years coupling hydrological models with hydrodynamic models has been used successfully to study the catchment waterbody relationship optimizing management practices by describing the importance of representing hydrological and hydrodynamic processes simultaneously and allowing assessments of changes in waterbody hydrological regimes table 1 in contrast to traditional frameworks integrated modeling considering large lakes and their watersheds as a single system allows a better understanding of how physical hydrological processes interact over short spatial and temporal scales affecting the responses of downstream waterbodies this approach also improves the prediction capabilities of the basin response and waterbody behavior especially in waterbodies with hydrodynamics and water quality controlled by river discharges the coupling between hydrological and hydrodynamic models is not performed directly with numerical difficulties arising in this regard the coupled approach can show numerical instabilities due to the different spatial discretization often used in the catchment where a coarser computational grid is used and in the lake where a more refined computational grid is often applied chávarri et al 2013 cunge et al 1980 wu 2008 in addition the hydrological model might oversimplify the representation of physical processes due to the large computational and spatial scale required to model large watersheds todini 2007 however the most common problem encountered in using mathematical models to represent aquatic ecosystems is the availability of datasets that are required to use the models this can be a limitation especially in regions where the scarcity of available data and the data analysis preparation can be an excessively time consuming task patro et al 2009 also in some regions and countries hydrological data are often not publicly accessible chipman and lillesand 2007 remote sensing data can be an alternative way to obtain information for sites where in situ measurements are sparse or difficult to obtain alsdorf et al 2007 calmant et al 2008 satellite altimetry data derived from remote sensors are a cutting edge tool used for validation of models schneider et al 2017 providing data with unprecedentedly high spatial resolution from ungauged sites several studies have used satellite altimetry data to validate both hydrological and hydrodynamic models the most commonly used altimetry data are from the envisat mission birkinshaw et al 2014 paiva et al 2013b and the icesat satellite hall et al 2011 jarihani et al 2015 o loughlin et al 2016 these provide valuable information to calibrate and validate hydrological hydrodynamic models as complementary sources of data for regions where no gauges are available or the data are not in the public domain in this study we investigated the coupling between a large scale hydrological model with a hydrodynamic model to simulate the dynamics of a large lake and its catchment differently from previous studies here we proposed a first step toward using the synergy between large scale hydrological hydrodynamic modeling satellite altimetry data and in situ measurements in a large lake by using this integration we can improve our understanding of the main factors controlling the hydrodynamic processes in this ecosystem using a spatially explicit approach our approach goes beyond the conventional integration of these three tools due to the synchronization of the watershed lake system on a long term time scale allowing simultaneous evaluation of different periods wet and dry periods daily variation and seasonality and the responses to the ecosystem in addition our approach can be used to predict stream flow in areas that are ungauged or poorly gauged with better representation of larger discharge volumes and substantially higher peak discharges than are included in the available data in summary the study had three objectives i to build a coupled hydrological hydrodynamic model to better understand catchment lake behavior and the main hydrodynamic components lake water levels and flow structure ii to validate the use of satellite altimetry data by comparing against in situ and simulated lake water level values from the coupled model iii to quantify the effects of the external forcing river discharges water withdrawals and wind on the hydrodynamic processes in the lake these objectives provided the structural sub headings used in the following methods results and discussion sections 2 study site and materials the lake mirim basin which is a river basin shared by brazil and uruguay 31 00 and 35 00 s 052 15 and

hydrological conditions and output flow the lake is located in a strategic region for brazil and uruguay due to the political and economic significance of the region both countries use water from lake mirim for irrigating ricefields as well as to supply the surrounding population lake mirim is connected to the larger patos lagoon lake water surface area 10 000 km2 through the são gonçalo channel

brazilian authorities and with public domain data for the uruguayan side meteorological data were provided by the instituto uruguayo de meteorología inumet controlled by the uruguayan authorities and also with public domain data the hydrological model was forced using 53 rainfall gauges distributed near the basin boundary and 17 streamflow gauge stations which were used for flow calibration fig 1

model consisted of hourly air temperature solar radiation wind direction and intensity and daily relative humidity precipitation and evaporation these datasets were used as forces acting on the simulated water surface the data were obtained from three meteorological stations rio grande jaguarão and santa vitória and were provided by inmet daily water level time series were recorded at two

hydrological model mgb iph modelo de grandes bacias instituto de pesquisas hidráulicas collischonn et al 2007 2005 collischonn and tucci 2001 fan et al 2014 paiva et al 2013a and the iph eco model fragoso et al 2009 was adopted the simulated time series of river discharges from the hydrological model was used as input for the hydrodynamic model fig 2 the models were run sequentially first the mgb iph model to estimate the incoming flow into the lake and then the iph eco model to estimate and calibrate the water levels using the data observed at two stations in lake mirim 3 1 1 hydrological modeling the mgb iph model is a large scale distributed hydrological model that uses physical and conceptual equations to predict the process of the terrestrial hydrological cycle collischonn et al 2007 in the mgb iph model the basin is divided into small unit catchments using geoprocessing tools from digital elevation models combinations of land use and soil type within each catchment unit are defined following a hydrological response unit hru approach kouwen et al 1993 the mgb iph model calculates the evapotranspiration from the penman monteith approach shuttleworth 1993 using five climatology variables air temperature atmospheric pressure wind velocity vapor pressure and solar radiation canopy interception is calculated using the vegetation leaf area index the soil water balance and surface runoff are calculated using the approach proposed in the arno model todini 1996 and the streamflow is estimated through the river network using the muskingum cunge method the mgb iph model has been successfully used in south america in multiple studies of large basins in recent years e g collischonn et al 2005 paiva et al 2013a getirana et al 2010 nóbrega et al 2011 fan et al 2015a siqueira et al 2016 pontes et al 2017 for the mgb iph model application the lake mirim basin was divided into 26 sub basins and 499 small unit catchments each of these sub basins has its outlet on the lakeshore and is related to the larger rivers in the sub basin in the model discretization we used the digital elevation model from srtm dem farr et al 2007 six hrus were defined based on available soil type and land use maps and a daily time step was used in the simulations during the calibration and validation step the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nash and sutcliffe 1970 for streamflow ens nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient for logarithms of streamflow enslog and relative volume errors δv were calculated between in situ observed and model simulated data at each available gauging station 3 1 2 hydrodynamic modelling the iph eco model fragoso et al 2009 describes the main hydrodynamic biotic and abiotic components in aquatic environments it can be used to assess physical chemical or biological processes separately or to assess the simultaneous interaction of these processes the model has a hydrodynamic module that describes the velocity fields and water levels using a semi implicit approach based on the trim model to solve the navier stokes equation in structured quadrilateral grids casulli and cheng 1992 the model also uses the theta method to improve the accuracy of its numerical solution casulli and cattani 1994 the momentum equations are discretized using a eulerian lagrangian approach cheng et al 1993 the iph eco solves an advection diffusion reaction type of equation which integrates the velocity field and water level output from the hydrodynamic module with a heat budget described by chapra 2008 for lakes several studies e g cavalcanti et al 2016 fragoso et al 2011 2008 pereira et al 2013 have been conducted in brazil denmark and sweden to assess ecological processes in shallow lakes using the iph eco model for application to lake mirim the lake was discretized using a 500 m resolution structured quadrilateral grid resulting in 15 289 computational cells only one vertical layer was used resulting in a two dimensional vertically integrated model the wetting and drying of computational cells were performed with a drying limit of 0 05 m the period of simulation was set from 1 january 2000 to 31 december 2010 we used the first year 2000 as model spin up time to mitigate the influence of initial conditions the simulation was performed using a computational time step of 60 s the inflow time series from the hydrological model and a dynamic estimated outflow time series explained below were used as boundary conditions to simulate the lake mirim system to estimate the outflow time series from lake mirim we included the water withdrawal to supply ricefields along the lakeshore and the outflow through the são gonçalo channel fig 1 to represent water withdrawal to ricefields we assumed a constant pumping rate 2 l s 1 ha 1 during the rice cultivation period november february for the complete time series jan 2000 dec 2010 fig 3 which was successfully used in a previous application for the same watershed fragoso et al 2011 tassi et al 2013 the water withdrawal to ricefields was calculated from the rice yields in the 2000 2010 period on both the brazilian side irga 2013 klering et al 2013 and the uruguayan side mgap 2013 the outflows through the são gonçalo channel were modeled based on a trapezoidal weir equation the iph eco model was validated using the time series data available for daily water level recorded at the santa izabel and santa vitória gauge stations to evaluate the accuracy of the iph eco model the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient ens the coefficient of determination r2 bias and root mean square error rmse were calculated between the simulated water level and the in situ measurement in the results section we present the river basin hydrological modeling and the lake hydrodynamic modeling results for the eleven year study period 2000 2010 we also present the simulated flow structure in the results for lake mirim 3 2 validation of simulated water level using satellite altimetry data we validated the simulated water level from the iph eco model using six virtual stations derived from the icesat and envisat missions fig 6 the statistical analysis for icesat and envisat data was performed using the median of water level data estimated from satellite data compared against the median simulated water level data we evaluated the accuracy of the icesat and envisat data using the performance statistics ens r2 bias and rmse 3 3 effects of external forcings on hydrodynamic processes in the lake after validating the model we conducted tests to evaluate the effects of hydrological and external forcing on the main hydrodynamic components of the lake e g water levels velocity fields flow structure we studied the flow structure in different periods low and high water removing the effects of wind and analyzing the changes in different lake regions next we evaluated the impacts of irrigation withdrawals on the lake water levels using the proposed models considering that the water withdrawals are influenced by the water pumping rules for irrigation which in turn depend on the potential area for the rice crop we carried out a water withdrawal analysis using different pumping rates 0 1 2 and 3 l s 1 ha 1 we also calculated the water balance to evaluate the impacts of river discharges irrigation withdrawals evaporation and rainfall on the lake volume in addition we also evaluated the relative influence by altering the stream flow of the main tributary rivers and the impact of river flow regulation by reservoirs on lake mirim water levels in this latter scenario the regulated streamflow for each reservoir was expressed as 1 q reg 0 9 q m where q reg is the discharge rate due to the flow regulated by each reservoir and q m is the mean river discharge for the 2000 2010 period 4 results 4 1 large scale hydrological hydrodynamic modeling the results of the parameter estimation and the optimized values for both the distributed large scale hydrological model mgb iph and the hydrodynamic model iph eco are listed in table 2 4 1 1 discharges the results of the simulated against observed river discharges indicated that the simulated discharges derived from the mgb iph model agreed well with the observed discharges fig 4 in more than half of the stream gauges the ens was higher than 0 6 and the model accurately represented the mean volume discharge the relative volume errors δv are lower than 10 for all gauge stations the comparison between simulated and observed hydrographs at five checkpoints in the lake mirim basin fig 5 showed that for some peak flows and seasonal fluctuations from gauge stations located in the upper basin the hydrological model performed well the smaller peaks were represented with some limitations 4 1 2 lake water levels the results for water level showed that the observed daily water surface level was well represented for the 2000 2010 period fig 6 the coupled approach used accurately represented the seasonality and the maximum and minimum periods for the santa isabel gauge station fig 6a ens 0 91 r2 0 91 rmse 0 321 m bias 0 32 m and the santa vitória gauge station fig 6b ns 0 90 r2 0 90 rmse 0 355 m bias 0 10 m 4 2 validation of simulated water level using satellite altimetry data fig 7 shows the simulated water level validation at six virtual stations distributed along lake mirim the results showed a good fit between the icesat altimetry data and the simulated water levels virtual stations b c e f the envisat data provided a poorer fit than the icesat data virtual stations a d but the general trend of the level variations was well represented 4 3 effects of external forcings on hydrodynamic processes in the lake 4 3 1 flow structure in lake mirim in view of the difficulty of performing a detailed analysis for all simulations at each time step only four periods were used to analyze the results 7 april 2005 low water level period fig 8 a 27 may 2005 rising water level period fig 8b 6 july 2005 high water level period fig 8c and 21 december 2005 falling water level period fig 8d the different velocity fields in each period showed a complex flow structure composed of different recirculation areas the results also showed that the rising water levels 27 may 2005 fig 8b were related to an increase in flow velocities in the falling water level period 21 december 2005 fig 8d although the overall velocity intensity was lower the recirculation areas and flow patterns were similar to the other periods the maximum flow velocities about 0 20 m s 1 were observed in deeper regions near the lake center and the minimum flow velocities were observed in the nearshore areas 4 3 2 wind action on water levels and velocity fields wind forcing produces wide variations in flow structure and circulation patterns fig 9 shows the velocity fields for a situation without wind using the same four periods 7 april 2005 low water level period 27 may 2005 rising water level period 6 july 2005 high water level period and 21 december 2005 falling water level period for all periods the wind influences the flow structure leading to a decrease in surface flow velocities and circulation patterns indeed in comparison with the current scenario fig 8 the situation without wind fig 9 causes a decrease in flow velocities for the four critical time periods analyzed with velocities ranging between 0 and 0 05 m s 1 the results from three representative points located in the northern central and southern regions of lake mirim from january 2000 to december 2010 showed the influence of wind on the short term time scale of water level dynamics fig 10 daily water levels fluctuate widely when the wind acts on the lake which was not observed for the situation without wind the shallow areas were more prone to water level variations due to wind stress and fluctuated most at the northern point 1 7 m on 31 october 2010 4 3 3 influence of water withdrawals on surface water levels the impact of reducing the water withdrawals for irrigation on the monthly means and daily water levels is depicted in fig 11 the results showed that the lake water levels are strongly influenced by the irrigation withdrawals if the current pumping rate is increased to 3 l s 1 ha 1 the impact of irrigation would be stronger during november to march summer fig 11a reaching variations between 0 20 and 0 25 m in monthly lake water levels however this extreme value is unlikely since irrigation practices and management in the region are improving on a yearly basis the effect of water withdrawal is more variable with some years being more sensitive to irrigation e g 2001 and 2004 2006 than others 2000 2002 2003 and 2009 2010 4 3 4 water balance estimated for the lake the results for water balance fig 12 highlight the importance of the cebollati river as the main tributary of lake mirim this river contributed more than 40 of the total lake volume in 2010 and almost 35 of the volume in 2006 35 in the 2000 2010 average fig 12b other key factors in the water balance were evaporation and rainfall contributing more than 27 and 30 respectively in 2006 18 and 22 in the 2000 2010 average 4 3 5 relative influence of main tributary rivers on lake water levels the lake water levels are strongly affected by the river discharges and the cebollati river causes the main variations in lake water levels fig 13 the impact of the cebollati river was strongest during june and july winter accounting for variations between 0 93 m and 0 98 m in monthly lake water levels regarding the impact of river flow regulation on the lake water levels the widest variations 0 20 m in monthly lake water levels were observed when the streamflow of the main rivers cebollati tacuari and jaguarão were regulated simultaneously qreg ceb tac jag 5 discussion 5 1 large scale hydrological hydrodynamic modeling examination of the overall performance of the large scale hydrological model indicated that the mgb iph model was able to reproduce the observed hydrography at different spatial scales and showed better accuracy on the brazilian side than on the uruguayan side of the watershed this pattern may be related to the smaller number of rain gauges on the uruguayan side where the rainfall in the catchments in uruguay was estimated primarily by interpolation from gauges that are farther apart than on the brazilian side this was especially important for some higher peak flows in the years 2005 and 2008 in the cebollati river which were overestimated by the model also the coarser resolution of the soil type and soil use datasets may have made the hru delineation less reliable limiting the model calibration similar limitations related to input data in applications for south american basins were found by paiva et al 2013a fan et al 2014 and fan et al 2015b further applications to improve the river basin hydrological modeling results should include testing with more detailed rainfall data e g radar or more gauge stations and to obtain more detailed spatial data within uruguay the coupling between the large scale hydrological model mgb iph and the iph eco hydrodynamic module compared to in situ measurements and satellite altimetry data successfully represented the surface water levels in lake mirim even for maximum level 2002 and minimum level 2005 periods and the seasonal dynamics of the water levels although the evaluation of dry and wet years can be carried out from various drought indices e g standardized precipitation index spi percent of normal precipitation index pnpi with at least 30 years of data amirataee and montaseri 2016 our approach using 11 years of data provides interesting hints related to dry periods wet periods and extreme years although hydrodynamic modeling studies in lake mirim have not been conducted previously and no field data were available to assess the flow velocity our results indicated that the coupled models represent reasonably well the expected velocity fields and flow structure patterns from this approach it was possible to represent the high spatial and temporal heterogeneity in hydrodynamic features which is difficult to explore with an approach based on lumped models that employ simplified representations of hydrodynamic processes obtaining non representative results in most cases wu 2008 kim et al 2012 the results for the coupled models showed slightly better accuracy in daily water level estimation at the santa isabel gauge station than at the santa vitória gauge station this can be explained by the strong influence of large river discharges cebollati river in the southern lake region which raise the water level at the santa vitória gauge station as previously observed by oliveira et al 2015 5 2 validation of simulated water level using satellite altimetry data the results for validation of lake water levels from the satellite altimetry data indicated that the model fit better with the icesat derived levels than with those derived from envisat satellite data even though the time series obtained from envisat contains more altimetry data 2002 2012 operation period the accuracy of our data was consistent with the accuracies found in previous studies brenner et al 2007 zhang et al 2011 hall et al 2012 which showed that the water level data from the icesat instrument had higher precision and vertical accuracy than the envisat radar data besides the long repeat cycle 91 days errors in the saturation and atmospheric forward scattering o loughlin et al 2016 urban et al 2008 further altimetry missions using the icesat 2 and cryosat 2 satellites could be used to improve accuracy in water level measurements for lake mirim 5 3 effects of external forcings on hydrodynamic processes in the lake simulation results showed that the lake water levels velocity fields circulation patterns and flow recirculation were dominated at the seasonal scale months by the river discharges and at smaller scales days by wind both speed and direction which is similar to observations in large lakes within large river basins such as lake tana in ethiopia dargahi and setegn 2011 and poyang lake in china li et al 2014 despite the lack of previous studies and field data available to validate our results they provide interesting hints related to the lake hydrodynamics e g circulation patterns as observed in other studies huang et al 2014 laval et al 2003 lindim et al 2011 for lake mirim because of its large surface area 4000 km2 and shallow waters mean depth 4 5 m the wind directly influences the dynamic behavior of the water level variation as found in similar environments such as patos lagoon fernandes et al 2002 2005 and lake mangueira fragoso et al 2011 wind stress produces seiches that can result in wide variations in the lake water level up to 3 m between the south and north ends southerly winds push the water northward raising the water levels at the santa izabel gauge station while winds from the north raise the water levels in the southern lake regions nevertheless previous studies showed that in some regions of south america brazil and argentina the observed near surface wind speed trend is declining 0 017 and 0 023 m s 1 y 1 respectively da silva et al 2010 vautard et al 2010 which contributes to trends in the evaporative demand mcvicar et al 2012 and can affect the water levels in lake mirim the larger volume of water withdrawal qmax 420 m3 s 1 in the 2003 2004 period due to increasing demand for ricefield irrigation area to be irrigated 327 000 ha mgap 2013 irga 2013 klering et al 2013 is another key driving factor lowering the water levels in lake mirim highest variation 0 43 m although drawdown of irrigation water is a common problem in other large lakes desgranges et al 2006 leira and cantonati 2008 dargahi and setegn 2011 hassanzadeh et al 2014 this can be a matter of concern for water resource management in the lake mirim basin also affecting the physical chemical and biological processes in the lake as in other environments tatsumi and yamashiki 2015 liu et al 2015 ambrosetti et al 2003 our results also showed that the main hydrodynamic processes e g water levels velocity fields and flow structure in lake mirim are controlled at the seasonal scale months by the river discharges from the main tributaries and water withdrawals for irrigation and at smaller scales days by wind intensity and direction the simulated water levels showed that irrigation withdrawals significantly influence the water levels the calculated lake water balance fig 12 showed that the cebollati river is the main tributary of lake mirim 40 of the 2010 total lake volume and together with the remaining river discharges governs the temporal patterns water levels in the lake fig 13 and fig 14 this hydrodynamic driver has been observed previously in lake mirim oliveira et al 2015 lopes and fan 2015 and in other large lakes dawidek and ferencz 2014 dessie et al 2015 hu et al 2018 where the external forcing factors e g river discharges play an important role in the variations of lake water levels the good correspondence obtained between estimated and observed water levels in the calibration process would not be possible without the coupled large scale hydrological and hydrodynamic modeling affecting the spatial and temporal variability representation of lake mirim water levels the river discharges estimated using a hydrological regionalization method a traditional approach fig 15 b were overestimated when compared against the river discharges estimated in this study using the hydrological model fig 15a 5 4 uncertainty and limitations uncertainties still exist with the coupled hydrologic hydrodynamic modeling related to 1 water withdrawals for irrigation of ricefields which depends on the potential area for the rice crop 2 the complex variation of the boundary conditions such as the inflows into lake mirim estimated from the hydrological model and possible inconsistencies in some input data such as precipitation because of the scarcity of data for the region these data are the most sensitive variable that causes significant errors in all output variables e g flow discharge and water levels mul et al 2009 sharma et al 2012 3 the sensitivity of the model parameters related to the river and floodplain features roughness characteristics and bathymetry data 4 the lack of data on the sluice system operating rules in the são gonçalo channel 5 errors in the numerical solution methods discretization and iteration errors of the hydrologic hydrodynamic models chávarri et al 2013 wu 2008 and 6 the evaporation rates over the lake which can influence the lake water levels nevertheless this topic together with the lake heat fluxes net short wave sw net long wave lw sensible heat se and latent heat le will be further discussed in a future manuscript munar et al 2018 to be submitted despite the complexity in model calibration and validation and the difficulty in estimating the uncertainty propagated from the catchment model to the hydrodynamic model other approaches should also be implemented in the future for uncertainty analysis and to reduce the error in the modelling results such as approaches based on probabilistic framework camacho et al 2015 del giudice et al 2015 or using the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue method beven and binley 1992 beven et al 2015 finally one of the limitations of our assessment was related to our inability to represent groundwater flows and the surface runoff volume of the floodplain between the catchment hydrological model and the lake model lake mirim may gain or lose water to local aquifers despite the importance of this aspect for our approach the interaction between the lake and the shallow aquifers in terms of the groundwater flow was not apparent and was not an important term for the representation of the lake levels for example also the scale of our study and the data available to us do not allow us to further investigate this topic based on the authors field knowledge and irga no known irrigation wells of any significant size are present in the basin 6 conclusion this study demonstrated the coupling of the large scale mgb iph hydrological model with the iph eco hydrodynamic module in order to represent the river basin response and the main hydrodynamic processes in lake mirim e g velocity fields and water levels the coupled models allowed us to assess the hydrodynamic behavior of lake mirim during the 2000 2010 period it was possible to reproduce the lake responses to the watershed the main external forcing factors such as wind the spatial and temporal variability of the water levels and the complex flow structure this was the first study coupling a large scale basin with a large subtropical shallow waterbody using an eleven year time scale and validating the results from in situ measurements and satellite altimetry data our approach goes beyond the previously reported couplings allowing us to assess different hydrological conditions in the basin and the lake behavior and response to the impact of anthropogenic stressors e g irrigation withdrawals over the long term our results also showed that the main hydrodynamic processes e g water levels velocity fields and flow structure in lake mirim are controlled at the seasonal scale months by the river discharges from the main tributaries and water withdrawals for irrigation and at smaller scales days by wind intensity and direction the simulated water levels showed that irrigation withdrawals significantly influence the water levels the proposed approach integrating distributed hydrological modeling and hydrodynamic modeling is a first attempt to simulate the lake mirim basin as a whole improving understanding of the main driving factors that influence the responses of the lake to hydrological processes in the watershed lake system and also reducing dependence on the observed data for discharge boundaries this framework may be widely applicable in complex large scale watershed large shallow lake environments especially for areas that are ungauged or systems with limited data available the overall methodology proposed here can be

7078,changes in hydrological processes in large watersheds may heavily impact the dynamics of downstream aquatic ecosystems such as lakes and reservoirs in general simple approaches that neglect the spatial heterogeneity of watersheds impede understanding of the many processes occurring in these downstream aquatic ecosystems in most cases observed river discharges are used as the boundary condition for lake reservoir modeling which limits analyses of different situations and of areas that are ungauged or water bodies with little data available therefore coupling hydrological models with hydrodynamic models seems to be a promising approach to allow one to understand how catchment features e g land use topography and river discharges impact the dynamic patterns including local circulation patterns water levels and water quality in large water bodies in response to basin wide forcing factors in this study we used a complex spatially explicit integrated approach to assess the hydrological responses to external forcing factors such as wind and river discharges in the hydrodynamics of a large shallow subtropical lake a large scale integrated system composed of several sub watersheds and a lake was analyzed by coupling a large scale hydrological model with a hydrodynamic model our findings indicated that i the integrated model improved the capacity for representing the spatial and temporal variability of lake water surface levels ii the main hydrodynamic processes water levels and flow structure are controlled on a seasonal scale months by the river discharges and on a short time scale days by wind influence intensity and direction and iii the modeling strategy allowed evaluation of anthropogenic stressors such as irrigation withdrawals on lake levels this approach is an attempt to develop a physically based management model to simulate complex systems as a whole allowing one to understand the main factors controlling the hydrodynamic processes and

and kercher 2005 many of these waterbodies are threatened by changes in hydrological processes in upland basins human activities and climate change leading to significant variations in both the water level and hydrodynamic balance jones et al 2001 legesse et al 2004 carpenter et al 1992 casanova and brock 2000 these variations in water volume play a crucial role in physical processes environmental impacts and socio economic implications such as shoreline damage from episodes of high water levels foulds 1977 meadows et al 1997 and water quality issues during periods of low water levels wildman et al 2011 khan et al 2015 in addition for lakes and reservoirs it is important to understand the catchment and hydrodynamic processes that will control the aquatic ecosystem dynamics such as phytoplankton spatial heterogeneity sediment transport and density currents e g pinardi et al 2015 curtarelli et al 2015 qi et al 2016 the main inputs of water for reservoirs lagoons and lakes located in the downstream portion of large watersheds are the rivers that discharge directly into these ecosystems only a few studies have explored the mathematical modeling of catchment lake dynamics considering the behavior of both the watershed and the lake often lake modeling studies use approaches that consider only the lake itself without modeling the catchment where the hydrological processes occur in addition the majority of lake modeling studies have focused mainly on hydrodynamics and or water quality dynamics e g fernandes et al 2001 2002 2005 marques et al 2009 barros et al 2014 li et al 2017 seiler et al 2015 xue et al 2015 in these studies the inflows from river discharge to the lake were considered only at specific locations and were limited to observed data with limited temporal frequency since the river discharges were not properly represented the capacity to analyze different management scenarios and spatially explicit dynamic patterns e g mixing regime hydrodynamic patterns and relative importance of the river discharge to the overall water balance is limited in recent years coupling hydrological models with hydrodynamic models has been used successfully to study the catchment waterbody relationship optimizing management practices by describing the importance of representing hydrological and hydrodynamic processes simultaneously and allowing assessments of changes in waterbody hydrological regimes table 1 in contrast to traditional frameworks integrated modeling considering large lakes and their watersheds as a single system allows a better understanding of how physical hydrological processes interact over short spatial and temporal scales affecting the responses of downstream waterbodies this approach also improves the prediction capabilities of the basin response and waterbody behavior especially in waterbodies with hydrodynamics and water quality controlled by river discharges the coupling between hydrological and hydrodynamic models is not performed directly with numerical difficulties arising in this regard the coupled approach can show numerical instabilities due to the different spatial discretization often used in the catchment where a coarser computational grid is used and in the lake where a more refined computational grid is often applied chávarri et al 2013 cunge et al 1980 wu 2008 in addition the hydrological model might oversimplify the representation of physical processes due to the large computational and spatial scale required to model large watersheds todini 2007 however the most common problem encountered in using mathematical models to represent aquatic ecosystems is the availability of datasets that are required to use the models this can be a limitation especially in regions where the scarcity of available data and the data analysis preparation can be an excessively time consuming task patro et al 2009 also in some regions and countries hydrological data are often not publicly accessible chipman and lillesand 2007 remote sensing data can be an alternative way to obtain information for sites where in situ measurements are sparse or difficult to obtain alsdorf et al 2007 calmant et al 2008 satellite altimetry data derived from remote sensors are a cutting edge tool used for validation of models schneider et al 2017 providing data with unprecedentedly high spatial resolution from ungauged sites several studies have used satellite altimetry data to validate both hydrological and hydrodynamic models the most commonly used altimetry data are from the envisat mission birkinshaw et al 2014 paiva et al 2013b and the icesat satellite hall et al 2011 jarihani et al 2015 o loughlin et al 2016 these provide valuable information to calibrate and validate hydrological hydrodynamic models as complementary sources of data for regions where no gauges are available or the data are not in the public domain in this study we investigated the coupling between a large scale hydrological model with a hydrodynamic model to simulate the dynamics of a large lake and its catchment differently from previous studies here we proposed a first step toward using the synergy between large scale hydrological hydrodynamic modeling satellite altimetry data and in situ measurements in a large lake by using this integration we can improve our understanding of the main factors controlling the hydrodynamic processes in this ecosystem using a spatially explicit approach our approach goes beyond the conventional integration of these three tools due to the synchronization of the watershed lake system on a long term time scale allowing simultaneous evaluation of different periods wet and dry periods daily variation and seasonality and the responses to the ecosystem in addition our approach can be used to predict stream flow in areas that are ungauged or poorly gauged with better representation of larger discharge volumes and substantially higher peak discharges than are included in the available data in summary the study had three objectives i to build a coupled hydrological hydrodynamic model to better understand catchment lake behavior and the main hydrodynamic components lake water levels and flow structure ii to validate the use of satellite altimetry data by comparing against in situ and simulated lake water level values from the coupled model iii to quantify the effects of the external forcing river discharges water withdrawals and wind on the hydrodynamic processes in the lake these objectives provided the structural sub headings used in the following methods results and discussion sections 2 study site and materials the lake mirim basin which is a river basin shared by brazil and uruguay 31 00 and 35 00 s 052 15 and

hydrological conditions and output flow the lake is located in a strategic region for brazil and uruguay due to the political and economic significance of the region both countries use water from lake mirim for irrigating ricefields as well as to supply the surrounding population lake mirim is connected to the larger patos lagoon lake water surface area 10 000 km2 through the são gonçalo channel

2015a siqueira et al 2016 pontes et al 2017 for the mgb iph model application the lake mirim basin was divided into 26 sub basins and 499 small unit catchments each of these sub basins has its outlet on the lakeshore and is related to the larger rivers in the sub basin in the model discretization we used the digital elevation model from srtm dem farr et al 2007 six hrus were defined based on available soil type and land use maps and a daily time step was used in the simulations during the calibration and validation step the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nash and sutcliffe 1970 for streamflow ens nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient for logarithms of streamflow enslog and relative volume errors δv were calculated between in situ observed and model simulated data at each available gauging station 3 1 2 hydrodynamic modelling the iph eco model fragoso et al 2009 describes the main hydrodynamic biotic and abiotic components in aquatic environments it can be used to assess physical chemical or biological processes separately or to assess the simultaneous interaction of these processes the model has a hydrodynamic module that describes the velocity fields and water levels using a semi implicit approach based on the trim model to solve the navier stokes equation in structured quadrilateral grids casulli and cheng 1992 the model also uses the theta method to improve the accuracy of its numerical solution casulli and cattani 1994 the momentum equations are discretized using a eulerian lagrangian approach cheng et al 1993 the iph eco solves an advection diffusion reaction type of equation which integrates the velocity field and water level output from the hydrodynamic module with a heat budget described by chapra 2008 for lakes several studies e g cavalcanti et al 2016 fragoso et al 2011 2008 pereira et al 2013 have been conducted in brazil denmark and sweden to assess ecological processes in shallow lakes using the iph eco model for application to lake mirim the lake was discretized using a 500 m resolution structured quadrilateral grid resulting in 15 289 computational cells only one vertical layer was used resulting in a two dimensional vertically integrated model the wetting and drying of computational cells were performed with a drying limit of 0 05 m the period of simulation was set from 1 january 2000 to 31 december 2010 we used the first year 2000 as model spin up time to mitigate the influence of initial conditions the simulation was performed using a computational time step of 60 s the inflow time series from the hydrological model and a dynamic estimated outflow time series explained below were used as boundary conditions to simulate the lake mirim system to estimate the outflow time series from lake mirim we included the water withdrawal to supply ricefields along the lakeshore and the outflow through the são gonçalo channel fig 1 to represent water withdrawal to ricefields we assumed a constant pumping rate 2 l s 1 ha 1 during the rice cultivation period november february for the complete time series jan 2000 dec 2010 fig 3 which was successfully used in a previous application for the same watershed fragoso et al 2011 tassi et al 2013 the water withdrawal to ricefields was calculated from the rice yields in the 2000 2010 period on both the brazilian side irga 2013 klering et al 2013 and the uruguayan side mgap 2013 the outflows through the são gonçalo channel were modeled based on a trapezoidal weir equation the iph eco model was validated using the time series data available for daily water level recorded at the santa izabel and santa vitória gauge stations to evaluate the accuracy of the iph eco model the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient ens the coefficient of determination r2 bias and root mean square error rmse were calculated between the simulated water level and the in situ measurement in the results section we present the river basin hydrological modeling and the lake hydrodynamic modeling results for the eleven year study period 2000 2010 we also present the simulated flow structure in the results for lake mirim 3 2 validation of simulated water level using satellite altimetry data we validated the simulated water level from the iph eco model using six virtual stations derived from the icesat and envisat missions fig 6 the statistical analysis for icesat and envisat data was performed using the median of water level data estimated from satellite data compared against the median simulated water level data we evaluated the accuracy of the icesat and envisat data using the performance statistics ens r2 bias and rmse 3 3 effects of external forcings on hydrodynamic processes in the lake after validating the model we conducted tests to evaluate the effects of hydrological and external forcing on the main hydrodynamic components of the lake e g water levels velocity fields flow structure we studied the flow structure in different periods low and high water removing the effects of wind and analyzing the changes in different lake regions next we evaluated the impacts of irrigation withdrawals on the lake water levels using the proposed models considering that the water withdrawals are influenced by the water pumping rules for irrigation which in turn depend on the potential area for the rice crop we carried out a water withdrawal analysis using different pumping rates 0 1 2 and 3 l s 1 ha 1 we also calculated the water balance to evaluate the impacts of river discharges irrigation withdrawals evaporation and rainfall on the lake volume in addition we also evaluated the relative influence by altering the stream flow of the main tributary rivers and the impact of river flow regulation by reservoirs on lake mirim water levels in this latter scenario the regulated streamflow for each reservoir was expressed as 1 q reg 0 9 q m where q reg is the discharge rate due to the flow regulated by each reservoir and q m is the mean river discharge for the 2000 2010 period 4 results 4 1 large scale hydrological hydrodynamic modeling the results of the parameter estimation and the optimized values for both the distributed large scale hydrological model mgb iph and the hydrodynamic model iph eco are listed in table 2 4 1 1 discharges the results of the simulated against observed river discharges indicated that the simulated discharges derived from the mgb iph model agreed well with the observed discharges fig 4 in more than half of the stream gauges the ens was higher than 0 6 and the model accurately represented the mean volume discharge the relative volume errors δv are lower than 10 for all gauge stations the comparison between simulated and observed hydrographs at five checkpoints in the lake mirim basin fig 5 showed that for some peak flows and seasonal fluctuations from gauge stations located in the upper basin the hydrological model performed well the smaller peaks were represented with some limitations 4 1 2 lake water levels the results for water level showed that the observed daily water surface level was well represented for the 2000 2010 period fig 6 the coupled approach used accurately represented the seasonality and the maximum and minimum periods for the santa isabel gauge station fig 6a ens 0 91 r2 0 91 rmse 0 321 m bias 0 32 m and the santa vitória gauge station fig 6b ns 0 90 r2 0 90 rmse 0 355 m bias 0 10 m 4 2 validation of simulated water level using satellite altimetry data fig 7 shows the simulated water level validation at six virtual stations distributed along lake mirim the results showed a good fit between the icesat altimetry data and the simulated water levels virtual stations b c e f the envisat data provided a poorer fit than the icesat data virtual stations a d but the general trend of the level variations was well represented 4 3 effects of external forcings on hydrodynamic processes in the lake 4 3 1 flow structure in lake mirim in view of the difficulty of performing a detailed analysis for all simulations at each time step only four periods were used to analyze the results 7 april 2005 low water level period fig 8 a 27 may 2005 rising water level period fig 8b 6 july 2005 high water level period fig 8c and 21 december 2005 falling water level period fig 8d the different velocity fields in each period showed a complex flow structure composed of different recirculation areas the results also showed that the rising water levels 27 may 2005 fig 8b were related to an increase in flow velocities in the falling water level period 21 december 2005 fig 8d although the overall velocity intensity was lower the recirculation areas and flow patterns were similar to the other periods the maximum flow velocities about 0 20 m s 1 were observed in deeper regions near the lake center and the minimum flow velocities were observed in the nearshore areas 4 3 2 wind action on water levels and velocity fields wind forcing produces wide variations in flow structure and circulation patterns fig 9 shows the velocity fields for a situation without wind using the same four periods 7 april 2005 low water level period 27 may 2005 rising water level period 6 july 2005 high water level period and 21 december 2005 falling water level period for all periods the wind influences the flow structure leading to a decrease in surface flow velocities and circulation patterns indeed in comparison with the current scenario fig 8 the situation without wind fig 9 causes a decrease in flow velocities for the four critical time periods analyzed with velocities ranging between 0 and 0 05 m s 1 the results from three representative points located in the northern central and southern regions of lake mirim from january 2000 to december 2010 showed the influence of wind on the short term time scale of water level dynamics fig 10 daily water levels fluctuate widely when the wind acts on the lake which was not observed for the situation without wind the shallow areas were more prone to water level variations due to wind stress and fluctuated most at the northern point 1 7 m on 31 october 2010 4 3 3 influence of water withdrawals on surface water levels the impact of reducing the water withdrawals for irrigation on the monthly means and daily water levels is depicted in fig 11 the results showed that the lake water levels are strongly influenced by the irrigation withdrawals if the current pumping rate is increased to 3 l s 1 ha 1 the impact of irrigation would be stronger during november to march summer fig 11a reaching variations between 0 20 and 0 25 m in monthly lake water levels however this extreme value is unlikely since irrigation practices and management in the region are improving on a yearly basis the effect of water withdrawal is more variable with some years being more sensitive to irrigation e g 2001 and 2004 2006 than others 2000 2002 2003 and 2009 2010 4 3 4 water balance estimated for the lake the results for water balance fig 12 highlight the importance of the cebollati river as the main tributary of lake mirim this river contributed more than 40 of the total lake volume in 2010 and almost 35 of the volume in 2006 35 in the 2000 2010 average fig 12b other key factors in the water balance were evaporation and rainfall contributing more than 27 and 30 respectively in 2006 18 and 22 in the 2000 2010 average 4 3 5 relative influence of main tributary rivers on lake water levels the lake water levels are strongly affected by the river discharges and the cebollati river causes the main variations in lake water levels fig 13 the impact of the cebollati river was strongest during june and july winter accounting for variations between 0 93 m and 0 98 m in monthly lake water levels regarding the impact of river flow regulation on the lake water levels the widest variations 0 20 m in monthly lake water levels were observed when the streamflow of the main rivers cebollati tacuari and jaguarão were regulated simultaneously qreg ceb tac jag 5 discussion 5 1 large scale hydrological hydrodynamic modeling examination of the overall performance of the large scale hydrological model indicated that the mgb iph model was able to reproduce the observed hydrography at different spatial scales and showed better accuracy on the brazilian side than on the uruguayan side of the watershed this pattern may be related to the smaller number of rain gauges on the uruguayan side where the rainfall in the catchments in uruguay was estimated primarily by interpolation from gauges that are farther apart than on the brazilian side this was especially important for some higher peak flows in the years 2005 and 2008 in the cebollati river which were overestimated by the model also the coarser resolution of the soil type and soil use datasets may have made the hru delineation less reliable limiting the model calibration similar limitations related to input data in applications for south american basins were found by paiva et al 2013a fan et al 2014 and fan et al 2015b further applications to improve the river basin hydrological modeling results should include testing with more detailed rainfall data e g radar or more gauge stations and to obtain more detailed spatial data within uruguay the coupling between the large scale hydrological model mgb iph and the iph eco hydrodynamic module compared to in situ measurements and satellite altimetry data successfully represented the surface water levels in lake mirim even for maximum level 2002 and minimum level 2005 periods and the seasonal dynamics of the water levels although the evaluation of dry and wet years can be carried out from various drought indices e g standardized precipitation index spi percent of normal precipitation index pnpi with at least 30 years of data amirataee and montaseri 2016 our approach using 11 years of data provides interesting hints related to dry periods wet periods and extreme years although hydrodynamic modeling studies in lake mirim have not been conducted previously and no field data were available to assess the flow velocity our results indicated that the coupled models represent reasonably well the expected velocity fields and flow structure patterns from this approach it was possible to represent the high spatial and temporal heterogeneity in hydrodynamic features which is difficult to explore with an approach based on lumped models that employ simplified representations of hydrodynamic processes obtaining non representative results in most cases wu 2008 kim et al 2012 the results for the coupled models showed slightly better accuracy in daily water level estimation at the santa isabel gauge station than at the santa vitória gauge station this can be explained by the strong influence of large river discharges cebollati river in the southern lake region which raise the water level at the santa vitória gauge station as previously observed by oliveira et al 2015 5 2 validation of simulated water level using satellite altimetry data the results for validation of lake water levels from the satellite altimetry data indicated that the model fit better with the icesat derived levels than with those derived from envisat satellite data even though the time series obtained from envisat contains more altimetry data 2002 2012 operation period the accuracy of our data was consistent with the accuracies found in previous studies brenner et al 2007 zhang et al 2011 hall et al 2012 which showed that the water level data from the icesat instrument had higher precision and vertical accuracy than the envisat radar data besides the long repeat cycle 91 days errors in the saturation and atmospheric forward scattering o loughlin et al 2016 urban et al 2008 further altimetry missions using the icesat 2 and cryosat 2 satellites could be used to improve accuracy in water level measurements for lake mirim 5 3 effects of external forcings on hydrodynamic processes in the lake simulation results showed that the lake water levels velocity fields circulation patterns and flow recirculation were dominated at the seasonal scale months by the river discharges and at smaller scales days by wind both speed and direction which is similar to observations in large lakes within large river basins such as lake tana in ethiopia dargahi and setegn 2011 and poyang lake in china li et al 2014 despite the lack of previous studies and field data available to validate our results they provide interesting hints related to the lake hydrodynamics e g circulation patterns as observed in other studies huang et al 2014 laval et al 2003 lindim et al 2011 for lake mirim because of its large surface area 4000 km2 and shallow waters mean depth 4 5 m the wind directly influences the dynamic behavior of the water level variation as found in similar environments such as patos lagoon fernandes et al 2002 2005 and lake mangueira fragoso et al 2011 wind stress produces seiches that can result in wide variations in the lake water level up to 3 m between the south and north ends southerly winds push the water northward raising the water levels at the santa izabel gauge station while winds from the north raise the water levels in the southern lake regions nevertheless previous studies showed that in some regions of south america brazil and argentina the observed near surface wind speed trend is declining 0 017 and 0 023 m s 1 y 1 respectively da silva et al 2010 vautard et al 2010 which contributes to trends in the evaporative demand mcvicar et al 2012 and can affect the water levels in lake mirim the larger volume of water withdrawal qmax 420 m3 s 1 in the 2003 2004 period due to increasing demand for ricefield irrigation area to be irrigated 327 000 ha mgap 2013 irga 2013 klering et al 2013 is another key driving factor lowering the water levels in lake mirim highest variation 0 43 m although drawdown of irrigation water is a common problem in other large lakes desgranges et al 2006 leira and cantonati 2008 dargahi and setegn 2011 hassanzadeh et al 2014 this can be a matter of concern for water resource management in the lake mirim basin also affecting the physical chemical and biological processes in the lake as in other environments tatsumi and yamashiki 2015 liu et al 2015 ambrosetti et al 2003 our results also showed that the main hydrodynamic processes e g water levels velocity fields and flow structure in lake mirim are controlled at the seasonal scale months by the river discharges from the main tributaries and water withdrawals for irrigation and at smaller scales days by wind intensity and direction the simulated water levels showed that irrigation withdrawals significantly influence the water levels the calculated lake water balance fig 12 showed that the cebollati river is the main tributary of lake mirim 40 of the 2010 total lake volume and together with the remaining river discharges governs the temporal patterns water levels in the lake fig 13 and fig 14 this hydrodynamic driver has been observed previously in lake mirim oliveira et al 2015 lopes and fan 2015 and in other large lakes dawidek and ferencz 2014 dessie et al 2015 hu et al 2018 where the external forcing factors e g river discharges play an important role in the variations of lake water levels the good correspondence obtained between estimated and observed water levels in the calibration process would not be possible without the coupled large scale hydrological and hydrodynamic modeling affecting the spatial and temporal variability representation of lake mirim water levels the river discharges estimated using a hydrological regionalization method a traditional approach fig 15 b were overestimated when compared against the river discharges estimated in this study using the hydrological model fig 15a 5 4 uncertainty and limitations uncertainties still exist with the coupled hydrologic hydrodynamic modeling related to 1 water withdrawals for irrigation of ricefields which depends on the potential area for the rice crop 2 the complex variation of the boundary conditions such as the inflows into lake mirim estimated from the hydrological model and possible inconsistencies in some input data such as precipitation because of the scarcity of data for the region these data are the most sensitive variable that causes significant errors in all output variables e g flow discharge and water levels mul et al 2009 sharma et al 2012 3 the sensitivity of the model parameters related to the river and floodplain features roughness characteristics and bathymetry data 4 the lack of data on the sluice system operating rules in the são gonçalo channel 5 errors in the numerical solution methods discretization and iteration errors of the hydrologic hydrodynamic models chávarri et al 2013 wu 2008 and 6 the evaporation rates over the lake which can influence the lake water levels nevertheless this topic together with the lake heat fluxes net short wave sw net long wave lw sensible heat se and latent heat le will be further discussed in a future manuscript munar et al 2018 to be submitted despite the complexity in model calibration and validation and the difficulty in estimating the uncertainty propagated from the catchment model to the hydrodynamic model other approaches should also be implemented in the future for uncertainty analysis and to reduce the error in the modelling results such as approaches based on probabilistic framework camacho et al 2015 del giudice et al 2015 or using the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue method beven and binley 1992 beven et al 2015 finally one of the limitations of our assessment was related to our inability to represent groundwater flows and the surface runoff volume of the floodplain between the catchment hydrological model and the lake model lake mirim may gain or lose water to local aquifers despite the importance of this aspect for our approach the interaction between the lake and the shallow aquifers in terms of the groundwater flow was not apparent and was not an important term for the representation of the lake levels for example also the scale of our study and the data available to us do not allow us to further investigate this topic based on the authors field knowledge and irga no known irrigation wells of any significant size are present in the basin 6 conclusion this study demonstrated the coupling of the large scale mgb iph hydrological model with the iph eco hydrodynamic module in order to represent the river basin response and the main hydrodynamic processes in lake mirim e g velocity fields and water levels the coupled models allowed us to assess the hydrodynamic behavior of lake mirim during the 2000 2010 period it was possible to reproduce the lake responses to the watershed the main external forcing factors such as wind the spatial and temporal variability of the water levels and the complex flow structure this was the first study coupling a large scale basin with a large subtropical shallow waterbody using an eleven year time scale and validating the results from in situ measurements and satellite altimetry data our approach goes beyond the previously reported couplings allowing us to assess different hydrological conditions in the basin and the lake behavior and response to the impact of anthropogenic stressors e g irrigation withdrawals over the long term our results also showed that the main hydrodynamic processes e g water levels velocity fields and flow structure in lake mirim are controlled at the seasonal scale months by the river discharges from the main tributaries and water withdrawals for irrigation and at smaller scales days by wind intensity and direction the simulated water levels showed that irrigation withdrawals significantly influence the water levels the proposed approach integrating distributed hydrological modeling and hydrodynamic modeling is a first attempt to simulate the lake mirim basin as a whole improving understanding of the main driving factors that influence the responses of the lake to hydrological processes in the watershed lake system and also reducing dependence on the observed data for discharge boundaries this framework may be widely applicable in complex large scale watershed large shallow lake environments especially for areas that are ungauged or systems with limited data available the overall methodology proposed here can be

7079,globally water quality degradation severely threatens the security of water resources understanding a river s capacity to accommodate pollutants or water environmental capacity wec can help efficiently protect rivers however the requirement for comprehensive ground observed hydrological and water quality data in previous methods makes it difficult to estimate wec in areas with limited ground observations this paper proposes a new framework for wec estimation in data scarce areas based on remotely sensed skin water temperature and limited ground observations two new models were developed to calculate the two critical parameters for wec estimation water temperature and integrated pollutant degradation coefficients k images of aster surface kinetic temperature ast 08 90 m grid product were used to retrieve water temperatures the above results were subsequently used to calculate a river s capacity to accommodate pollutants or wec in agriculturally dominated areas the use of remote sensing techniques enables the methods to be applied over large spatial scales and to areas with limited ground observations the application and testing of the framework in four rivers including two chinese rivers the huai and the wei rivers and two australian rivers the ovens and the gwydir rivers suggest that the models performed well to calculate the real time water temperature and the coefficient k based on limited ground observations uncertainty analysis on water temperature calculated from remotely sensed land surface temperature and ground observed meteorological air temperature suggests that remotely sensed water temperature had high concurrence with ground observations rmse 3 08 c with r2 0 88 while the sparse spatially distributed meteorological stations reduced the accuracy in estimating water temperature rmse 4 39 c with r2 0 91 we found that the coefficient k increased with water temperature over different seasons in an exponential form but in a logarithmical form with streamflow velocity comparison with previous research and other models with abundant data revealed the practicability and effectiveness of our models which can be easily applied to rivers with insufficient ground observations across the globe keywords hydrology water quality river water environmental capacity data scarce area 1 introduction rapid socio economic development in developing countries has resulted in many quality problems in rivers levashova et al 2004 liu et al 2011 pollution discharged from upstream watersheds and excessive upstream water abstraction has dramatically changed the hydrological regimes and reduce the dilution capacity of a river and may significantly degrade water quality at downstream reaches yoon et al 2015 this deterioration of water quality negatively affects socio economic development and damages the water ecosystem joniak and kuczyńska kippen 2010 rui et al 2015 the rapid deterioration of river water quality urgently requires effective water quality management strategies to reduce the resulting environmental pressures li and zou 2015 the most common approach for water quality protection is the use of water quality standards allowing for the selection of protection levels han et al 2010 li et al 2010 water quality standards or boundary values for water quality indicators are then used to calculate the water environmental capacity wec or the capacity of a water body to accommodate a certain amount of pollutants and subsequently to reduce the amount of pollutants discharging into rivers the wec has a similar role in water quality protection with the terms assimilative capacity payandeh et al 2015 total maximum daily loads bachmann et al 2003 cooter et al 2010 kim et al 2014 etc wang et al 2015 management of the wec is a key factor to control pollution in rivers keller and cavallaro 2008 based on the estimation of the wec the total allowable amount of pollutants discharged into rivers can be obtained and allocated appropriately among different industries and areas to ensure that the emission quantities are within the wec chen et al 2014 a number of methods has emerged for determining the wec with either simple or complicated mathematical statistical models antonellini et al 2014 cuadra and björklund 2007 gong and jin 2009 liu and borthwick 2011 pandey et al 2011 zhang et al 2014b wang et al 2014 yang et al 2015 water quality models with one two and three dimensions have been used widely and significant progress has been achieved imteaz and asaeda 2000 wan et al 2001 park et al 2005 testa et al 2013 li et al 2015 in general the models have a high demand for ground observations of hydrology and water quality as well as for scientific expertise several models require extensive field measurement campaigns and also may rely on expert panels which can lack transparency in making recommendations or are influenced by expert bias hughes et al 2014 that can be very costly alcazar et al 2008 in addition in many real world situations neither the financial capacity nor the necessary scientific expertise is available consequently a lack of effective hydrological and water quality monitoring creates difficulties in river water quality protection yu et al 2015 this significantly restricts the wide application of traditional wec models in situations with insufficient ground monitoring of hydrological and water quality parameters therefore significantly limited data availability appeals less data intensive or parsimonious methods which can be applied in many different situations with limited ground observations hughes et al 2014 in the wec models the rate of pollutant degradation in rivers can be determined by using the integrated degradation coefficient caep 2003 dang et al 2009 the most critical factors influencing the integrated degradation coefficient are water temperature and river discharge chen et al 2007 gomes and wai 2014 for organic pollutants water temperature is the principal factor influencing the integrated degradation coefficient wright and mcdonell 1979 brown and barnwell 1987 li and liao 2002 yang et al 2014 therefore the integrated degradation coefficient for organic pollutants in rivers can be estimated via the water temperature dependent function this greatly facilitates estimation of the wec in areas with insufficient ground observations for water quality due to the easy access to water temperature estimated via meteorological air temperature or remotely sensed land surface temperature this significantly extends the potential to rapidly estimate the wec in data limited areas remote sensing techniques are very convenient in obtaining geo information from the earth s surface at multiple temporal spatial scales gassman et al 2007 nesme et al 2012 e g land use and vegetation leuning et al 2008 li et al 2009 nesme et al 2012 duan et al 2014 land surface temperature and

the great advantage for remote sensing in extrapolating land lst temperature makes it easy to estimate the wec in data limited areas among all remotely sensed lst the aster surface kinetic temperature

al 2013 teggi et al 2014 zhang et al 2014a wan et al 2017 is often derived from the methods for land surface temperature lst lst and wst are the most commonly remotely sensed data available for restoration of freshwater ecosystems because water temperature controls the biogeochemical and hydrological processes and plays crucial roles in energy and heat exchanges between water and atmosphere alcântara et al 2010 thiemann and schiller 2003 but the skin wst e g within the upper 0 1 mm of the water surface can merely reflect the thermal radiation status within a very thin depth under the water surface thus it cannot be directly used to replace the bulk wst e g within 10 cm or 4 m below the water surface torgersen et al 2001 a key parameter for wec estimation in the river ecosystem the photosynthetic rate of phytoplankton controlling the degeneration rate of organic pollutants and influencing the magnitude of wec often occurs in the upper 4 m water layer e g for lake constance around noon thiemann and schiller 2003 a conversion between skin and bulk wsts has to be made to avoid unexpected uncertainties in the applications li et al 2013 a regional algorithm for bulk temperature was presented for lake constance but had high data requirement e g data of air temperature from a weather station within the last three days which are often hard to get in data limited regions restricted its application in other regions across the world thiemann and schiller 2003 therefore it is urgently necessary to develop a new algorithm to convert the remotely sensed skin wst to bulk wst or water temperature used for wec calculation in ground data limited regions our primary goal was to set up a wec framework for rivers with limited ground observations based on the advantages of remote sensing techniques in obtaining data of water surface temperature our specific objectives were 1 to retrieve water temperature by converting remotely sensed skin wst to bulk wst in rivers with limited ground observations 2 to calculate the integrated degradation coefficient k for organic pollutants at any level of temperature and 3 to estimate the corresponding wec based on the coefficient k for ground observation limited areas this paper is structured around the three objectives in methods section 3 results and discussion section 4 and conclusion section 5 the data sets

varying with reach and season feng et al 2004 wu et al 2014a in the catchment of the river section between ljc and xy fig 1 many important cities and a large agriculture area are located water loss through agricultural activities industrial wastewater discharge and domestic sewage guo et al 2013 have seriously impacted the health of riverine ecosystems and has significantly restricted the sustainable development of the region to sustain the local socio economic development it is imperative to protect and restore the degraded water quality 2 2 dataset the mainstream of the wei river between the two water quality monitoring stations ljc and xy was selected to study its wec there are 9 sewage outlets 9 tributaries and 2 water abstraction canals along the 196 91 km length of this river section fig 1 the remotely sensed land surface temperatures ts aster surface kinetic temperature ast 08 90 m grid product from jan 2007 through dec 2009 were downloaded from the website https lpdaac usgs gov daily products with cloud cover were excluded to ensure the accuracy of monthly averaged values ts for water surface or wst within a mixing pixel was calculated using the esvep model in tang and li 2017 which can separate the net radiation from each other in a riparian mixing pixel as it considers the transmission of direct and diffuse shortwave radiation separately from the transmission of longwave radiation through the canopy taking the separated net radiation as a basis the temperature and evapotranspiration of components in the mixing pixel can be separated daily ts values at the pixel encompassing the water quality stations were selected and averaged as monthly values and subsequently used to construct a water temperature model all monthly ts values along the river section from ljc xy were subsequently inputted into the model to generate the monthly water temperature tw sequences along this river section additionally ground based air temperature ta data from nearby meteorological stations fig 1 were downloaded from the website of the china meteorological administration cma to test the effectiveness of remotely sensed land surface temperature ts in addition limited ground based tw measurements from jan 2007 to dec 2009 at station ljc were collected water quality indicators cod and nh3 n and stream flows at the water quality monitoring stations ljc and xy as well as at sewage outlets water use canal and tributaries were measured from jan 2007 to dec 2009 by the yellow river conservancy commission of the ministry of water resources mwr china all relevant data were subjected to quality control using the quality control methods of smirnov et al 2000 with which the high frequency temporal instability in the data series was eliminated by application of the criteria of triplet stability the water quality standard cs in mg l 1 highly affects the wec in sections with different water usage the wec was determined based on land use and vegetation cover maps drawn from satellite images as well as industrial statistics data the water usage of the river section between ljc and xy fig 1 represents the supply of water for both industrial and agricultural activities therefore the cs for the river section is restricted to 30 mg l 1 for cod and 1 5 mg l 1 for nh3 n according to the national environmental quality criteria for surface water gb 3838 2002 epac 2002 water with concentrations of cod and nh3 n lower than the corresponding standard values is fit for industrial and agricultural use 3 methods an empirical model for retrieval of water temperatures based on remotely sensed skin water surface temperature is initially presented for rivers with limited ground observations with this model the integrated degradation coefficient k for organic pollutants at any level of temperature is then calculated based on the calculated k the real time water environment capacity wec for rivers with limited ground observations can be estimated 3 1 retrieval of water temperature the abundantly available satellite products of skin wst ts in k bridge the gap to retrieve water temperatures in areas lacking ground observations in these areas the monthly bulk wst tw in c can be derived from remote sensed skin wst by using the newly developed regression equation between monthly tw and ts eq 1 the latter is the monthly skin wst averaged from the aster surface kinetic temperature daily 90 m grid product ast 08 in the present study 1 t w t w a t s t s b where t w and t s are regionally averaged annual bulk wst and skin wst e g the average annual values in a watershed which are easier to access than the daily or monthly values at a point a and b are coefficients that need to be calibrated before tw estimation 3 2 calculation of the integrated degradation coefficients the integrated degradation coefficient k in d 1 in a river section is often calibrated with the equation k 86 4 ln c 0 c 1 u l testa et al 2013 li et al 2015 where u is the averaged hydrological streamflow velocity in a river section in m s 1 and l is the length of the river section in km additionally the adjustment of k can be achieved by k 1 047 t w 20 k 20 caep 2003 chen et al 2014 where k20 is k at 20 c for water and tw stands for any water temperature combining the above two equations we can derive a new eq 2 to estimate the real time k at any level of water temperature 2 k 86 4 a 20 u l b 20 1 1 047 t w 20 where a20 and b20 are coefficients that can be easily calibrated for 20 c using the equation ln c 0 c 1 a 20 u l b 20 wang et al 2006 or directly using eq 2 based on a few observations in a straight river section therefore real time k for a given water temperature can be calculated easily with the satellite retrieved water temperature tw in eq 1 3 3 estimation of the water environmental capacity wec the wec allows for a certain amount of pollutants to be discharged into water bodies to ensure the concentration of pollutants are below water quality standards han et al 2010 chen et al 2014 the calculated integrated degradation coefficient k in section 3 2 and the water quality standard cs in mg l 1 for a river section were used to calculate wec based on zhao et al 2018 3 w q 0 q c s q 0 c 0 e k x 1 86 4 u where w is the water environmental capacity in g s 1 k is the integrated degradation coefficient q refers to the pollutant water discharge in m3 s 1 q0 is the river discharge through the upstream cross sections in the studied river section in m3 s 1 c0 is the concentration of a certain pollutant at the upstream cross section in mg l 1 and x1 is the distance from a sewage outlet or water use canal source to the upstream cross section in km water quality standard cs for the studied river section can be calculated considering the requirements of water supply in general the water usage requirement on pollutant concentration depends on regional land use vegetation cover and the socio economic development status in the adjacent terrestrial areas the former two can be mapped via satellite images e g landsat tm 30 m grid products and the latter is available in regional statistics records sbs and nbs sos 2007 2008 2009 cs was assigned the minimum value of requirements of all water usage on a pollutant nutrient for additional details please refer to zhao et al 2018 4 results and discussion 4 1 retrieval of water temperature with satellite lst products daily remotely sensed skin wst ts from the aster surface kinetic temperature 90 m grid product ast 08 in the wei river basin from 2007 to 2009 were initially averaged into monthly ts fig 2 based on these data the monthly ts values in the wei river were extracted the monthly aster surface temperature data at station ljc on the wei river were then correlated with the limited historical observations of water temperature at station ljc from 2007 to 2009 and subsequently used to determine the empirical formula between the surface temperature and the water temperature based on eq 1 as shown in eq 4 and fig 3 upper with this equation the water temperature sequence in the river section ljc xy was generated fig 3 lower which can be used to calculate k in eq 2 water temperature covering 36 months 2007 2009 at every pixel along the river section was retrieved over time water temperature varied periodically with seasons being high from the latter part of spring to summer orange and red colored areas in fig 3 lower more than 20 c and low during winter blue colors indicated areas less than 10 c spatially it varies slowly from upstream ljc to downstream xy with almost similarly colored areas despite some small fluctuations fig 3 lower all these water temperature values can be used for further calculation of the degradation coefficient k with eq 2 4 t w t w 1 14 t s t s 0 21 with t s 273 15 r 2 0 88 to evaluate uncertainties in water temperature assessments an alternative data source air temperature data ta from meteorological station no 57016 located near station ljc were analyzed together with the limited ground based tw measurements from jan 2007 to dec 2009 at station ljc using eq 1 a second formula to retrieve water temperature with meteorological air temperature was fitted as per eq 5 5 t w t w 0 63 t a t a 0 37 with t a 0 r 2 0 97 t w 0 62 t a t a 0 51 with t a 0 r 2 0 91 to analyze the uncertainties of the derived tw values between different data sources eq 4 was used to calculate the tw near the hydrological station ljc based on the aster surface temperature ts the results were plotted in fig 4 to compare with tw data derived from the meteorological air temperature ta data by using eq 5 tw values generated from meteorological air temperature data grey diamond in fig 4 were greater than the tw observations at station ljc rmse 4 39 c with r2 0 91 whereas tw values derived from the aster surface temperature blue circle in fig 4 were distributed evenly along the 1 1 line rmse 3 08 c with r2 0 88 the reason may be that the sparse distribution of meteorological stations caused discordance in the geographical position and produced bias from tw observations at station ljc in contrast the geographical position of remotely sensed ts products concurred with that of ground tw observations and produced a series of reasonable tw results also thermal inertia of air is very different from that of water causing bias in the tw generated from ta which is affected by meteorology more intensively than the water bodies 4 2 calculation of the integrated degradation coefficients to calibrate a20 and b20 in eq 2 observations from a field trial in 2006 were used the trial was conducted in a straight river section of 10 35 km between stations ljc and xy liu et al 2007 based on the selected observations at 20 c and using eq 2 parameters of a20 and b20 were calibrated as 1 14 and 0 11 for cod with a rmse root mean square error of 1 03 d 1 1 21 and 0 03 for nh3 n with a rmse of 0 47 d 1 based on these parameters two real time k equations were obtained 6 k 98 35 u l 0 89 1 047 t w 20 rmse 1 03 d 1 r 2 0 99 for cod and 7 k 104 37 u l 0 97 1 047 t w 20 rmse 0 47 d 1 r 2 0 99 for nh 3 n real time k changes with water temperature over different seasons and is also influenced by variations in hydrological streamflow velocity fig 5 the above real time k equations eqs 6 and 7 subsequently were used to estimate k in the wec of the wei river in the following sections of this paper in both eqs 6 and 7 k can be impacted by hydrological streamflow velocity u river length l and water temperature tw but the impact magnitudes of these three factors are unknown selection of the principal factor s impacting the k value is of great importance for the operation of water projects therefore relationships between degradation coefficients and river length k l water temperature k tw and streamflow velocity k u were studied figs 3 and 4 water temperature streamflow velocities and river lengths in decreasing pollutant concentrations were assumed to be important sources of uncertainties in k estimations liu et al 2007 wang et al 2012 thus the river section between ljc and xy was studied to demonstrate the influences of water temperature and streamflow velocity on k estimations based on relationships of k tw and k u analysis of all k related variables showed that water temperature and streamflow velocity do have the closest relationship with k fig 5 but accumulation of errors in estimating tw eq 4 from the remotely sensed aster surface kinetic temperature resulted in uncertainties in k estimates eqs 6 and 7 and subsequently lowered the correlation coefficients of k with water temperature and streamflow velocity r2 0 70 in fig 5 in general for both cod and nh3 n in the section between ljc and xy k increased with water temperature in an exponential form the value of k for cod was higher than that for nh3 n based on the same hydrological streamflow velocity regime with the correlation coefficient r of the former being slightly higher than that of the latter however the relationship between k and streamflow velocity exhibited a logarithmic form i e k increased with streamflow velocity logarithmically specifically k increased exponentially with water temperature and logarithmically with streamflow velocity as indicated in the research of zhao et al 2018 likewise results from chen et al 2014 showed that k for both cod and nh3 n increased with increasing water temperature similar to water temperature k for cod was higher than that for nh3 n at the same streamflow velocity in addition to water temperature and streamflow velocity river length was also studied to assess its impact on k using different lengths in a straight river section between ljc and xy generally the k values for both cod and nh3 n decreased with river length to explore the minimum river length required for k to maintain nearly constant values for the two parameters variations of ks and concentrations of the two parameters along with river length were plotted fig 6 it shows that k decreased abruptly in the initial 1 3 of the flow path while the decreasing trend slowed in the final 2 3 of the study section 4 10 km accordingly the concentration of the two parameters decreased rapidly with the reduction of k and reached relatively stable values after flowing more than 0 5 km in other words a river length of 4 km is required to attain a stable degradation coefficient which allows the pollutants as measured by cod and nh3 n to sufficiently degenerate as such the minimum river length of 4 km is required to maintain a steady k value in wec assessments overall k for cod was higher than that for nh3 n in the present study in july 2007 2009 k for cod was estimated as 0 38 0 83 d 1 and 0 70 1 27 d 1 upstream and downstream from station xy respectively and k for nh3 n was estimated as 0 24 0 57 d 1 and 0 47 0 91 d 1 upstream and downstream from station xy respectively liu et al 2007 studied the degradation coefficients for both cod and nh3 n near station xy in july 2006 and showed that the optimized k for cod was 1 03 d 1 and for nh3 n was 0 67 d 1 which are similar to results from the present study few differences exist because the variation of water temperature and streamflow velocity water temperature near station xy in july 2006 was 26 03 c with a streamflow velocity of 0 46 m s 1 liu et al 2007 while water temperature in july 2007 was 22 11 c with a streamflow velocity of 0 97 m s 1 which led to a higher k for cod 1 27 d 1 and the second highest k for nh3 n 0 91 d 1 an increase in streamflow velocity in july 2007 greater than two times that in july 2006 contributed significantly to the increase in ks both for cod and nh3 n su 2006 studied the degeneration process of cod near station xy using water quality data from 1992 to 2001 and found that the highest k for cod was 1 43 d 1 close to the highest value of 1 36 d 1 in aug 2007 in our study 4 3 estimation of the water environmental capacity wec both the wecs for cod and nh3 n were estimated in the wei river fig 7 their temporal variations concurred highly with the hydrological attributes streamflow velocity and runoff of the river as well as with water temperature the highest and lowest wecs were similar in their variations in relation to seasons generally in the wet season with high streamflow velocity and water temperature june to oct every year both of them showed steep increases in wec values in the dry season nov to may following year the wec values remained low with little fluctuation to evaluate our results two models of zhou et al 1999 and dang et al 2009 were then adopted to study uncertainties in wec estimation three rivers were selected one in china the huai river and two in australia the ovens and the gwydir rivers hadwen et al 2010 due to the scarce data availability the wecs for only cod in the huai river were calculated and compared and those for only nh3 n in the two australian rivers were compared fig 8 like that in the zhao et al 2018 study monthly river discharge datasets greater than zero in the huai river were selected from 1998 to 2003 the wec estimation results were then compared between the zhou et al 1999 dang et al 2009 and our models to further test the performance of our model we selected two rivers in australia the ovens and the gwydir rivers using nh3 n concentrations to compare the three models for their performance in calculating wec based on 12 concurrent samplings in december 2006 hadwen et al 2010 the results of our model in the huai river china fig 8a were between those of zhou et al 1999 and dang et al 2009 but closer to the latter model likewise the wec values based on our model in the two australian rivers fig 8b were between those of the zhou et al 1999 and dang et al 2009 models however the majority of the wec values derived from the dang et al 2009 model was below zero which deviates from standard practice this illustrates the feasibility of our model which is practical and more robust than the dang et al 2009 model this also demonstrates our model s potential application in regions with insufficient ground observations in brief the three comparisons in the three rivers revealed that our model is practical in assessing water environment capacities and shows good potential for application to rivers with insufficient ground observations 5 conclusion comprehensive water quality data required to run water environmental capacity wec models have limited their wide application in areas with limited ground observations a new framework to estimate the wec was presented in this framework water temperature was determined by using aster skin wst mapped from satellite images the degradation coefficient was calculated with few water quality observations the application of the framework in the wei river suggest that the real time k for cod is higher than that for nh3 n which varied with water temperature over different seasons and was also influenced by variations in streamflow velocity the k value increased exponentially with increasing water temperature but logarithmically with increasing streamflow velocity the minimum river length that assures a steady k value must be met before calculations can proceed modeling water temperatures calculated from remotely sensed land surface temperature and from meteorologically observed air temperature are promising the accuracy of the former attribute is higher than that of the latter the values of the former attribute were distributed evenly along the 1 1 line and had higher concurrence with ground observed values whereas the values of the latter attribute were much higher than that of the former deviating from the ground observed water temperature values this is attributed to the sparse distribution and coarse spatial resolution of the meteorological stations comparison with previous research and models which require comprehensive data reveals the practicability and effectiveness of our model which shows promise for application to rivers with insufficient ground observations

7079,globally water quality degradation severely threatens the security of water resources understanding a river s capacity to accommodate pollutants or water environmental capacity wec can help efficiently protect rivers however the requirement for comprehensive ground observed hydrological and water quality data in previous methods makes it difficult to estimate wec in areas with limited ground observations this paper proposes a new framework for wec estimation in data scarce areas based on remotely sensed skin water temperature and limited ground observations two new models were developed to calculate the two critical parameters for wec estimation water temperature and integrated pollutant degradation coefficients k images of aster surface kinetic temperature ast 08 90 m grid product were used to retrieve water temperatures the above results were subsequently used to calculate a river s capacity to accommodate pollutants or wec in agriculturally dominated areas the use of remote sensing techniques enables the methods to be applied over large spatial scales and to areas with limited ground observations the application and testing of the framework in four rivers including two chinese rivers the huai and the wei rivers and two australian rivers the ovens and the gwydir rivers suggest that the models performed well to calculate the real time water temperature and the coefficient k based on limited ground observations uncertainty analysis on water temperature calculated from remotely sensed land surface temperature and ground observed meteorological air temperature suggests that remotely sensed water temperature had high concurrence with ground observations rmse 3 08 c with r2 0 88 while the sparse spatially distributed meteorological stations reduced the accuracy in estimating water temperature rmse 4 39 c with r2 0 91 we found that the coefficient k increased with water temperature over different seasons in an exponential form but in a logarithmical form with streamflow velocity comparison with previous research and other models with abundant data revealed the practicability and effectiveness of our models which can be easily applied to rivers with insufficient ground observations across the globe keywords hydrology water quality river water environmental capacity data scarce area 1 introduction rapid socio economic development in developing countries has resulted in many quality problems in rivers levashova et al 2004 liu et al 2011 pollution discharged from upstream watersheds and excessive upstream water abstraction has dramatically changed the hydrological regimes and reduce the dilution capacity of a river and may significantly degrade water quality at downstream reaches yoon et al 2015 this deterioration of water quality negatively affects socio economic development and damages the water ecosystem joniak and kuczyńska kippen 2010 rui et al 2015 the rapid deterioration of river water quality urgently requires effective water quality management strategies to reduce the resulting environmental pressures li and zou 2015 the most common approach for water quality protection is the use of water quality standards allowing for the selection of protection levels han et al 2010 li et al 2010 water quality standards or boundary values for water quality indicators are then used to calculate the water environmental capacity wec or the capacity of a water body to accommodate a certain amount of pollutants and subsequently to reduce the amount of pollutants discharging into rivers the wec has a similar role in water quality protection with the terms assimilative capacity payandeh et al 2015 total maximum daily loads bachmann et al 2003 cooter et al 2010 kim et al 2014 etc wang et al 2015 management of the wec is a key factor to control pollution in rivers keller and cavallaro 2008 based on the estimation of the wec the total allowable amount of pollutants discharged into rivers can be obtained and allocated appropriately among different industries and areas to ensure that the emission quantities are within the wec chen et al 2014 a number of methods has emerged for determining the wec with either simple or complicated mathematical statistical models antonellini et al 2014 cuadra and björklund 2007 gong and jin 2009 liu and borthwick 2011 pandey et al 2011 zhang et al 2014b wang et al 2014 yang et al 2015 water quality models with one two and three dimensions have been used widely and significant progress has been achieved imteaz and asaeda 2000 wan et al 2001 park et al 2005 testa et al 2013 li et al 2015 in general the models have a high demand for ground observations of hydrology and water quality as well as for scientific expertise several models require extensive field measurement campaigns and also may rely on expert panels which can lack transparency in making recommendations or are influenced by expert bias hughes et al 2014 that can be very costly alcazar et al 2008 in addition in many real world situations neither the financial capacity nor the necessary scientific expertise is available consequently a lack of effective hydrological and water quality monitoring creates difficulties in river water quality protection yu et al 2015 this significantly restricts the wide application of traditional wec models in situations with insufficient ground monitoring of hydrological and water quality parameters therefore significantly limited data availability appeals less data intensive or parsimonious methods which can be applied in many different situations with limited ground observations hughes et al 2014 in the wec models the rate of pollutant degradation in rivers can be determined by using the integrated degradation coefficient caep 2003 dang et al 2009 the most critical factors influencing the integrated degradation coefficient are water temperature and river discharge chen et al 2007 gomes and wai 2014 for organic pollutants water temperature is the principal factor influencing the integrated degradation coefficient wright and mcdonell 1979 brown and barnwell 1987 li and liao 2002 yang et al 2014 therefore the integrated degradation coefficient for organic pollutants in rivers can be estimated via the water temperature dependent function this greatly facilitates estimation of the wec in areas with insufficient ground observations for water quality due to the easy access to water temperature estimated via meteorological air temperature or remotely sensed land surface temperature this significantly extends the potential to rapidly estimate the wec in data limited areas remote sensing techniques are very convenient in obtaining geo information from the earth s surface at multiple temporal spatial scales gassman et al 2007 nesme et al 2012 e g land use and vegetation leuning et al 2008 li et al 2009 nesme et al 2012 duan et al 2014 land surface temperature and

the great advantage for remote sensing in extrapolating land lst temperature makes it easy to estimate the wec in data limited areas among all remotely sensed lst the aster surface kinetic temperature ast 08 product generated using the five thermal infrared tir bands acquired either during the day or night time contains lst at 90 m spatial resolution for the land areas and is widely used for studies of volcanism thermal inertia surface energy and high resolution mapping of fires refer to https lpdaac usgs gov water surface temperature wst including skin or radiant wst and bulk wst li et al 2013 teggi et al 2014 zhang et al 2014a wan et al 2017 is often derived from the methods for land surface temperature lst lst and wst are the most commonly remotely sensed data available for restoration of freshwater ecosystems because water temperature controls the biogeochemical and hydrological processes and plays crucial roles in energy and heat exchanges between water and atmosphere alcântara et al 2010 thiemann and schiller 2003 but the skin wst e g within the upper 0 1 mm of the water surface can merely reflect the thermal radiation status within a very thin depth under the water surface thus it cannot be directly used to replace the bulk wst e g within 10 cm or 4 m below the water surface torgersen et al 2001 a key parameter for wec estimation in the river ecosystem the photosynthetic rate of phytoplankton controlling the degeneration rate of organic pollutants and influencing the magnitude of wec often occurs in the upper 4 m water layer e g for lake constance around noon thiemann and schiller 2003 a conversion between skin and bulk wsts has to be made to avoid unexpected uncertainties in the applications li et al 2013 a regional algorithm for bulk temperature was presented for lake constance but had high data requirement e g data of air temperature from a weather station within the last three days which are often hard to get in data limited regions restricted its application in other regions across the world thiemann and schiller 2003 therefore it is urgently necessary to develop a new algorithm to convert the remotely sensed skin wst to bulk wst or water temperature used for wec calculation in ground data limited regions our primary goal was to set up a wec framework for rivers with limited ground observations based on the advantages of remote sensing techniques in obtaining data of water surface temperature our specific objectives were 1 to retrieve water temperature by converting remotely sensed skin wst to bulk wst in rivers with limited ground observations 2 to calculate the integrated degradation coefficient k for organic pollutants at any level of temperature and 3 to estimate the corresponding wec based on the coefficient k for ground observation limited areas this paper is structured around the three objectives in methods section 3 results and discussion section 4 and conclusion section 5 the data sets used are described in section 2 2 study area and materials 2 1 study area the wei river basin situated between 103 5 and 110 5 e and 33 5 37 5 n is located in a continental monsoon climatic zone the mean temperature ranges from 6 to 14 c with a mean rainfall of 450 700 mm and the mean pan evaporation ranges from 1000 to 2000 mm li et al 2014 in recent decades the entire basin has encountered many serious droughts with long durations and high severity huang et al 2014 the basin is the primary region for agriculture industry and commerce in northwestern china song et al 2007 intensive human activities have resulted in substantial negative impacts on the wei river which are characterized by decreasing annual runoff and heavy pollution zuo et al 2014 as a result 69 2 of the water quality observations exceeded the national water protection standards e g in 2009 and resulted in serious degradation of ecosystem function wu et al 2014b the two principal issues in terms of pollution in this region are chemical oxygen demand cod and ammonia nitrogen nh3 n levels zhang et al 2012 which deserve special attention in future water resource protection strategies linjiacun ljc and xianyang xy are two important hydrological and water quality monitoring stations along the river the water surface width of this reach ranges from 27 to 500 m and the water depth varies from 0 25 to 3 9 m varying with reach and season feng et al 2004 wu et al 2014a in the catchment of the river section between ljc and xy fig 1 many important cities and a large agriculture area are located water loss through agricultural activities industrial wastewater discharge and domestic sewage guo et al 2013 have seriously impacted the health of riverine ecosystems and has significantly restricted the sustainable development of the region to sustain the local socio economic development it is imperative to protect and restore the degraded water quality 2 2 dataset the mainstream of the wei river between the two water quality monitoring stations ljc and xy was selected to study its wec there are 9 sewage outlets 9 tributaries and 2 water abstraction canals along the 196 91 km length of this river section fig 1 the remotely sensed land surface temperatures ts aster surface kinetic temperature ast 08 90 m grid product from jan 2007 through dec 2009 were downloaded from the website https lpdaac usgs gov daily products with cloud cover were excluded to ensure the accuracy of monthly averaged values ts for water surface or wst within a mixing pixel was calculated using the esvep model in tang and li 2017 which can separate the net radiation from each other in a riparian mixing pixel as it considers the transmission of direct and diffuse shortwave radiation separately from the transmission of longwave radiation through the canopy taking the separated net radiation as a basis the temperature and evapotranspiration of components in the mixing pixel can be separated daily ts values at the pixel encompassing the water quality stations were selected and averaged as monthly values and subsequently used to construct a water temperature model all monthly ts values along the river section from ljc xy were subsequently inputted into the model to generate the monthly water temperature tw sequences along this river section additionally ground based air temperature ta data from nearby meteorological stations fig 1 were downloaded from the website of the china meteorological administration cma to test the effectiveness of remotely sensed land surface temperature ts in addition limited ground based tw measurements from jan 2007 to dec 2009 at station ljc were collected water quality indicators cod and nh3 n and stream flows at the water quality monitoring stations ljc and xy as well as at sewage outlets water use canal and tributaries were measured from jan 2007 to dec 2009 by the yellow river conservancy commission of the ministry of water resources mwr china all relevant data were subjected to quality control using the quality control methods of smirnov et al 2000 with which the high frequency temporal instability in the data series was eliminated by application of the criteria of triplet stability the water quality standard cs in mg l 1 highly affects the wec in sections with different water usage the wec was determined based on land use and vegetation cover maps drawn from satellite images as well as industrial statistics data the water usage of the river section between ljc and xy fig 1 represents the supply of water for both industrial and agricultural activities therefore the cs for the river section is restricted to 30 mg l 1 for cod and 1 5 mg l 1 for nh3 n according to the national environmental quality criteria for surface water gb 3838 2002 epac 2002 water with concentrations of cod and nh3 n lower than the corresponding standard values is fit for industrial and agricultural use 3 methods an empirical model for retrieval of water temperatures based on remotely sensed skin water surface temperature is initially presented for rivers with limited ground observations with this model the integrated degradation coefficient k for organic pollutants at any level of temperature is then calculated based on the calculated k the real time water environment capacity wec for rivers with limited ground observations can be estimated 3 1 retrieval of water temperature the abundantly available satellite products of skin wst ts in k bridge the gap to retrieve water temperatures in areas lacking ground observations in these areas the monthly bulk wst tw in c can be derived from remote sensed skin wst by using the newly developed regression equation between monthly tw and ts eq 1 the latter is the monthly skin wst averaged from the aster surface kinetic temperature daily 90 m grid product ast 08 in the present study 1 t w t w a t s t s b where t w and t s are regionally averaged annual bulk wst and skin wst e g the average annual values in a watershed which are easier to access than the daily or monthly values at a point a and b are coefficients that need to be calibrated before tw estimation 3 2 calculation of the integrated degradation coefficients the integrated degradation coefficient k in d 1 in a river section is often calibrated with the equation k 86 4 ln c 0 c 1 u l testa et al 2013 li et al 2015 where u is the averaged hydrological streamflow velocity in a river section in m s 1 and l is the length of the river section in km additionally the adjustment of k can be achieved by k 1 047 t w 20 k 20 caep 2003 chen et al 2014 where k20 is k at 20 c for water and tw stands for any water temperature combining the above two equations we can derive a new eq 2 to estimate the real time k at any level of water temperature 2 k 86 4 a 20 u l b 20 1 1 047 t w 20 where a20 and b20 are coefficients that can be easily calibrated for 20 c using the equation ln c 0 c 1 a 20 u l b 20 wang et al 2006 or directly using eq 2 based on a few observations in a straight river section therefore real time k for a given water temperature can be calculated easily with the satellite retrieved water temperature tw in eq 1 3 3 estimation of the water environmental capacity wec the wec allows for a certain amount of pollutants to be discharged into water bodies to ensure the concentration of pollutants are below water quality standards han et al 2010 chen et al 2014 the calculated integrated degradation coefficient k in section 3 2 and the water quality standard cs in mg l 1 for a river section were used to calculate wec based on zhao et al 2018 3 w q 0 q c s q 0 c 0 e k x 1 86 4 u where w is the water environmental capacity in g s 1 k is the integrated degradation coefficient q refers to the pollutant water discharge in m3 s 1 q0 is the river discharge through the upstream cross sections in the studied river section in m3 s 1 c0 is the concentration of a certain pollutant at the upstream cross section in mg l 1 and x1 is the distance from a sewage outlet or water use canal source to the upstream cross section in km water quality standard cs for the studied river section can be calculated considering the requirements of water supply in general the water usage requirement on pollutant concentration depends on regional land use vegetation cover and the socio economic development status in the adjacent terrestrial areas the former two can be mapped via satellite images e g landsat tm 30 m grid products and the latter is available in regional statistics records sbs and nbs sos 2007 2008 2009 cs was assigned the minimum value of requirements of all water usage on a pollutant nutrient for additional details please refer to zhao et al 2018 4 results and discussion 4 1 retrieval of water temperature with satellite lst products daily remotely sensed skin wst ts from the aster surface kinetic temperature 90 m grid product ast 08 in the wei river basin from 2007 to 2009 were initially averaged into monthly ts fig 2 based on these data the monthly ts values in the wei river were extracted the monthly aster surface temperature data at station ljc on the wei river were then correlated with the limited historical observations of water temperature at station ljc from 2007 to 2009 and subsequently used to determine the empirical formula between the surface temperature and the water temperature based on eq 1 as shown in eq 4 and fig 3 upper with this equation the water temperature sequence in the river section ljc xy was generated fig 3 lower which can be used to calculate k in eq 2 water temperature covering 36 months 2007 2009 at every pixel along the river section was retrieved over time water temperature varied periodically with seasons being high from the latter part of spring to summer orange and red colored areas in fig 3 lower more than 20 c and low during winter blue colors indicated areas less than 10 c spatially it varies slowly from upstream ljc to downstream xy with almost similarly colored areas despite some small fluctuations fig 3 lower all these water temperature values can be used for further calculation of the degradation coefficient k with eq 2 4 t w t w 1 14 t s t s 0 21 with t s 273 15 r 2 0 88 to evaluate uncertainties in water temperature assessments an alternative data source air temperature data ta from meteorological station no 57016 located near station ljc were analyzed together with the limited ground based tw measurements from jan 2007 to dec 2009 at station ljc using eq 1 a second formula to retrieve water temperature with meteorological air temperature was fitted as per eq 5 5 t w t w 0 63 t a t a 0 37 with t a 0 r 2 0 97 t w 0 62 t a t a 0 51 with t a 0 r 2 0 91 to analyze the uncertainties of the derived tw values between different data sources eq 4 was used to calculate the tw near the hydrological station ljc based on the aster surface temperature ts the results were plotted in fig 4 to compare with tw data derived from the meteorological air temperature ta data by using eq 5 tw values generated from meteorological air temperature data grey diamond in fig 4 were greater than the tw observations at station ljc rmse 4 39 c with r2 0 91 whereas tw values derived from the aster surface temperature blue circle in fig 4 were distributed evenly along the 1 1 line rmse 3 08 c with r2 0 88 the reason may be that the sparse distribution of meteorological stations caused discordance in the geographical position and produced bias from tw observations at station ljc in contrast the geographical position of remotely sensed ts products concurred with that of ground tw observations and produced a series of reasonable tw results also thermal inertia of air is very different from that of water causing bias in the tw generated from ta which is affected by meteorology more intensively than the water bodies 4 2 calculation of the integrated degradation coefficients to calibrate a20 and b20 in eq 2 observations from a field trial in 2006 were used the trial was conducted in a straight river section of 10 35 km between stations ljc and xy liu et al 2007 based on the selected observations at 20 c and using eq 2 parameters of a20 and b20 were calibrated as 1 14 and 0 11 for cod with a rmse root mean square error of 1 03 d 1 1 21 and 0 03 for nh3 n with a rmse of 0 47 d 1 based on these parameters two real time k equations were obtained 6 k 98 35 u l 0 89 1 047 t w 20 rmse 1 03 d 1 r 2 0 99 for cod and 7 k 104 37 u l 0 97 1 047 t w 20 rmse 0 47 d 1 r 2 0 99 for nh 3 n real time k changes with water temperature over different seasons and is also influenced by variations in hydrological streamflow velocity fig 5 the above real time k equations eqs 6 and 7 subsequently were used to estimate k in the wec of the wei river in the following sections of this paper in both eqs 6 and 7 k can be impacted by hydrological streamflow velocity u river length l and water temperature tw but the impact magnitudes of these three factors are unknown selection of the principal factor s impacting the k value is of great importance for the operation of water projects therefore relationships between degradation coefficients and river length k l water temperature k tw and streamflow velocity k u were studied figs 3 and 4 water temperature streamflow velocities and river lengths in decreasing pollutant concentrations were assumed to be important sources of uncertainties in k estimations liu et al 2007 wang et al 2012 thus the river section between ljc and xy was studied to demonstrate the influences of water temperature and streamflow velocity on k estimations based on relationships of k tw and k u analysis of all k related variables showed that water temperature and streamflow velocity do have the closest relationship with k fig 5 but accumulation of errors in estimating tw eq 4 from the remotely sensed aster surface kinetic temperature resulted in uncertainties in k estimates eqs 6 and 7 and subsequently lowered the correlation coefficients of k with water temperature and streamflow velocity r2 0 70 in fig 5 in general for both cod and nh3 n in the section between ljc and xy k increased with water temperature in an exponential form the value of k for cod was higher than that for nh3 n based on the same hydrological streamflow velocity regime with the correlation coefficient r of the former being slightly higher than that of the latter however the relationship between k and streamflow velocity exhibited a logarithmic form i e k increased with streamflow velocity logarithmically specifically k increased exponentially with water temperature and logarithmically with streamflow velocity as indicated in the research of zhao et al 2018 likewise results from chen et al 2014 showed that k for both cod and nh3 n increased with increasing water temperature similar to water temperature k for cod was higher than that for nh3 n at the same streamflow velocity in addition to water temperature and streamflow velocity river length was also studied to assess its impact on k using different lengths in a straight river section between ljc and xy generally the k values for both cod and nh3 n decreased with river length to explore the minimum river length required for k to maintain nearly constant values for the two parameters variations of ks and concentrations of the two parameters along with river length were plotted fig 6 it shows that k decreased abruptly in the initial 1 3 of the flow path while the decreasing trend slowed in the final 2 3 of the study section 4 10 km accordingly the concentration of the two parameters decreased rapidly with the reduction of k and reached relatively stable values after flowing more than 0 5 km in other words a river length of 4 km is required to attain a stable degradation coefficient which allows the pollutants as measured by cod and nh3 n to sufficiently degenerate as such the minimum river length of 4 km is required to maintain a steady k value in wec assessments overall k for cod was higher than that for nh3 n in the present study in july 2007 2009 k for cod was estimated as 0 38 0 83 d 1 and 0 70 1 27 d 1 upstream and downstream from station xy respectively and k for nh3 n was estimated as 0 24 0 57 d 1 and 0 47 0 91 d 1 upstream and downstream from station xy respectively liu et al 2007 studied the degradation coefficients for both cod and nh3 n near station xy in july 2006 and showed that the optimized k for cod was 1 03 d 1 and for nh3 n was 0 67 d 1 which are similar to results from the present study few differences exist because the variation of water temperature and streamflow velocity water temperature near station xy in july 2006 was 26 03 c with a streamflow velocity of 0 46 m s 1 liu et al 2007 while water temperature in july 2007 was 22 11 c with a streamflow velocity of 0 97 m s 1 which led to a higher k for cod 1 27 d 1 and the second highest k for nh3 n 0 91 d 1 an increase in streamflow velocity in july 2007 greater than two times that in july 2006 contributed significantly to the increase in ks both for cod and nh3 n su 2006 studied the degeneration process of cod near station xy using water quality data from 1992 to 2001 and found that the highest k for cod was 1 43 d 1 close to the highest value of 1 36 d 1 in aug 2007 in our study 4 3 estimation of the water environmental capacity wec both the wecs for cod and nh3 n were estimated in the wei river fig 7 their temporal variations concurred highly with the hydrological attributes streamflow velocity and runoff of the river as well as with water temperature the highest and lowest wecs were similar in their variations in relation to seasons generally in the wet season with high streamflow velocity and water temperature june to oct every year both of them showed steep increases in wec values in the dry season nov to may following year the wec values remained low with little fluctuation to evaluate our results two models of zhou et al 1999 and dang et al 2009 were then adopted to study uncertainties in wec estimation three rivers were selected one in china the huai river and two in australia the ovens and the gwydir rivers hadwen et al 2010 due to the scarce data availability the wecs for only cod in the huai river were calculated and compared and those for only nh3 n in the two australian rivers were compared fig 8 like that in the zhao et al 2018 study monthly river discharge datasets greater than zero in the huai river were selected from 1998 to 2003 the wec estimation results were then compared between the zhou et al 1999 dang et al 2009 and our models to further test the performance of our model we selected two rivers in australia the ovens and the gwydir rivers using nh3 n concentrations to compare the three models for their performance in calculating wec based on 12 concurrent samplings in december 2006 hadwen et al 2010 the results of our model in the huai river china fig 8a were between those of zhou et al 1999 and dang et al 2009 but closer to the latter model likewise the wec values based on our model in the two australian rivers fig 8b were between those of the zhou et al 1999 and dang et al 2009 models however the majority of the wec values derived from the dang et al 2009 model was below zero which deviates from standard practice this illustrates the feasibility of our model which is practical and more robust than the dang et al 2009 model this also demonstrates our model s potential application in regions with insufficient ground observations in brief the three comparisons in the three rivers revealed that our model is practical in assessing water environment capacities and shows good potential for application to rivers with insufficient ground observations 5 conclusion comprehensive water quality data required to run water environmental capacity wec models have limited their wide application in areas with limited ground observations a new framework to estimate the wec was presented in this framework water temperature was determined by using aster skin wst mapped from satellite images the degradation coefficient was calculated with few water quality observations the application of the framework in the wei river suggest that the real time k for cod is higher than that for nh3 n which varied with water temperature over different seasons and was also influenced by variations in streamflow velocity the k value increased exponentially with increasing water temperature but logarithmically with increasing streamflow velocity the minimum river length that assures a steady k value must be met before calculations can proceed modeling water temperatures calculated from remotely sensed land surface temperature and from meteorologically observed air temperature are promising the accuracy of the former attribute is higher than that of the latter the values of the former attribute were distributed evenly along the 1 1 line and had higher concurrence with ground observed values whereas the values of the latter attribute were much higher than that of the former deviating from the ground observed water temperature values this is attributed to the sparse distribution and coarse spatial resolution of the meteorological stations comparison with previous research and models which require comprehensive data reveals the practicability and effectiveness of our model which shows promise for application to rivers with insufficient ground observations
