22175,a method based on the karhunen loève expansion kle is formulated for the assessment of arbitrary design spaces in shape optimization assessing the shape modification variability and providing the definition of a reduced dimensionality global model of the shape modification vector the method is based on the concept of geometric variance and does not require design performance analyses specifically the kle is applied to the continuous shape modification vector requiring the solution of a fredholm integral equation of the second kind once the equation is discretized the problem reduces to the principal component analysis pca of discrete geometrical data the objective of the present work is to demonstrate how this method can be used to a assess different design spaces and shape parameterization methods before optimization is performed and without the need of running simulations for the performance prediction and b reduce the dimensionality of the design space providing a shape reparameterization using kle pca eigenvalues and eigenmodes a demonstration for the hull form optimization of the dtmb 5415 model in calm water is shown where three design spaces are investigated namely provided by free form deformation radial basis functions and global modification functions keywords shape parameterization design space dimensionality reduction karhunen loève expansion proper orthogonal decomposition principal component analysis simulation based design optimization 1 introduction the simulation based design sbd paradigm has demonstrated the capability of supporting ship designers and marine ocean engineers not only providing large sets of design options but also exploring operational spaces by assessing the design performance for a large number of operating and environmental conditions the recent development of high performance computing hpc systems has driven the sbd towards integration with optimization algorithms and uncertainty quantification uq methods moving the sbd paradigm to automatic deterministic and stochastic sbd optimization sbdo campana et al 2006 diez et al 2018 and simulation driven sdd harries and abt 2019 formulations possibly aiming at global solutions to the design problem in shape design sbdo consists of three main elements as shown in fig 1 see right box i a deterministic and or stochastic simulation tool integrating physics based solvers with uq ii an optimization algorithm and iii a shape modification tool despite the increased computational power and robustness of numerical algorithms high fidelity sbdo for shape optimization still remains a challenging process from theoretical algorithmic and technological viewpoints among others one of the most complex challenge is how to deal with high dimensional large design spaces especially when computationally expensive black box functions are used for the performance analysis and a global optimum is sought after potential design improvements significantly depend on dimension and extension of the design space obviously high dimensionality and variability spaces are more difficult and expensive to explore but at the same time potentially allow for bigger improvements even if efficient global optimization algorithms have been proposed jones et al 1993 serani and diez 2018a and applied with success to sbdo campana et al 2015 serani et al 2016a finding a potentially global optimal solution within reasonable computational time cost remains a critical issue and a technological challenge additionally uq of complex applications is computationally very demanding especially if high order statistical moments and or quantiles need to be assessed as in robust and reliability based design optimization both global optimization and uq are affected by the curse of dimensionality as the algorithms complexity and computational cost rapidly increase with the problem dimension this is generally also true if metamodels are applied therefore the assessment and breakdown of the design space dimensionality are key elements for the efficiency and affordability of the sbdo diez et al 2015 in this context shape optimization research has traditionally focused on shape and topology parameterizations as critical factors to achieve the desired level of design variability rozvany et al 1992 bletzinger and maute 1997 samareh 2001 obviously the choice of the shape parameterization technique has a large impact on the practical implementation and the success of the optimization process shape deformation methods have been an area of continuous and extensive research within the fields of computer graphics and geometry modeling consequently a wide variety of techniques has been proposed during recent years sieger et al 2015 several techniques have been developed and applied samareh 2001 such as basis vector methods pickett jr et al 1973 domain element and discrete approaches leiva and watson 1998 partial differential equation bloor and wilson 1995 cad based yang 1995 analytical hicks and henne 1978 polynomials haftka and grandhi 1986 b splines grigoropoulos and chalkias 2010 non uniform rational bezier spline nurbs patches of bezier surfaces campana et al 2006 free form deformation ffd sederberg and parry 1986 and morphing approaches kandasamy et al 2013 in order for the sbdo to avoid the curse of dimensionality and be successful the parameterization method must efficiently describe the design variability with as few variables as possible however in most of past sbdo literature the trade off between geometric variability and design space dimensionality is not directly quantitatively addressed or only qualitatively assessed in order to solve complex and computationally demanding optimization problems on line linear design space dimensionality reduction techniques have been developed requiring the evaluation of the objective function or its gradient principal component analysis pca or proper orthogonal decomposition pod methods have been applied for local reduced dimensionality representations of feasible design regions raghavan et al 2013a b the associated pod pca based expansions are not truncated and the dimensionality reduction is achieved by a local representation of an α manifold of feasible designs embedding therefore the design constraints whose evaluation is required in the design parameterization and preserving the original feasible design variability a pca pod based approach is used in the active subspace method lukaczyk et al 2014 to discover and exploit low dimensional monotonic trends in the objective function based on the evaluation of its gradient this type of methods improve the optimization efficiency by basis rotation and or dimensionality reduction nevertheless they do not provide an assessment of the design space and associated shape parameterization before optimization is performed or objective function and or gradient are evaluated moreover if gradients are not directly provided as in the case of black box tools their evaluation by finite differences can be inaccurate due to numerical noise and or residuals affecting the solution finally these methods are local in nature and their extension to global optimization is not trivial nor straightforward off line or up front linear models have been developed with focus on design space variability and dimensionality reduction for efficient optimization procedures in borzì et al 2010 and schillings et al 2011 the karhunen loève expansion kle equivalent to pod is used for representing distributed geometrical uncertainties and building a reduced order spatial model for uq a method based on the kle has been formulated in diez et al 2015 for the assessment of the shape modification variability and the definition of a reduced dimensionality global model of the shape modification vector for arbitrary modification methods no objective function evaluation nor gradient is required by the method as this is entirely based on the concept of geometric variance kle is formulated in the continuous domain and reduces to the eigenproblem of an integral operator representing a fredholm integral equation of the second kind the discretization of the shape domain and associated integral equation yields the eigenproblem of a matrix which appears to be the autocovariance matrix of the discretized shape modification vector this corresponds to solving the pca of the discretized shape modification vector kle pca methods have been successfully applied for deterministic chen et al 2015 diez et al 2016a serani et al 2016a and stochastic diez et al 2018 hull form optimization of mono hulls and catamarans in calm water and waves respectively similarly poole et al 2017 have applied pod to airfoil shape optimization via singular value decomposition svd of an airfoil geometric data library off line methods improve the shape optimization efficiency by reparameterization and dimensionality reduction providing the assessment of the design space and the shape parameterization before optimization and or performance analysis are carried out the assessment is based on the geometric variability associated to the design space making the method fully off line and computationally very efficient and attractive as no simulations are required theory and mathematical derivation of design variability breakdown associated confidence levels and dimensionality reduction for hydrodynamic shape optimization still remain limited applications to ship hydrodynamic optimization are also limited the objective of the present work is to demonstrate how off line kle pca methods based on the concept on geometric variance can be used to assess different design spaces and shape parameterization methods before optimization is performed and without needing to run simulations for the design performance prediction the method is further exploited to reduce the dimensionality of the design spaces based on the kle pca eigenvalues providing an efficient shape reparameterization using kle pca eigenmodes the approach is shown in fig 1 the left box includes the elements of the geometry based formulation of the pre optimization off line design space dimensionality reduction method the right box represents a typical optimization loop including shape modification analysis tool e g computational fluid dynamics finite element analysis possibly coupled with uq and optimization algorithm whose detailed description is beyond the scope of the current work the method is demonstrated for the hull form optimization of the dtmb 5415 model an early and open to public version of the uss arleigh burke destroyer ddg 51 extensively used as an international benchmark for shape optimization problems e g campana et al 2018 hirsch et al 2018 the optimization aims at the reduction of the model scale calm water resistance at froude number equal to 0 28 simulations are based on a potential flow code with viscous correction three design spaces are investigated namely provided by ffd radial basis functions rbf and global modification functions gmf it may be noted that the objective of the investigation is not the comparison of different shape modification methods per se but the demonstration of how kle pca can be used to assess and compare different design spaces provided by arbitrary modification methods an example of comparison by kle pca of design spaces defined using the same modification method namely ffd is given in diez et al 2015 2 dimensionality reduction method general definitions and assumptions for design space assessment and dimensionality reduction are presented in the following for further details on the theory and implementation the interested reader is referred to diez et al 2015 2 1 general definitions and assumptions consider a geometric domain g which identifies the original or parent shape and a set of coordinates ξ g r n with n 1 2 3 assume that u u r m is the design variable vector which defines a continuous shape modification vector δ ξ u r m with m 1 2 3 with m not necessarily equal to n each ξ g is transformed in ξ g as 1 ξ ξ δ ξ u where g and g represent the original and modified shapes respectively see fig 2 consider u as a random variable with associated probability density function p u this corresponds to formulating the optimization problem as a problem affected by epistemic uncertainty in the sense that before solving the problem the optimal solution is yet unknown in this context the distribution p u represents the prior probability of finding an optimal solution in a given region of the design space although its definition can be based on experience and or earlier studies it is often not trivial and therefore the prior is usually defined as a uniform distribution function therefore giving each point in the design space the same probability to be an optimal solution the mean shape modification associated to p u is 2 δ u δ ξ u p u d u whereas the variance associated to the shape modification vector geometric variance is defined as 3 σ 2 δ 2 u g δ ξ u δ ξ u p u d ξ d u where δ δ δ for the sake of simplicity and without loss of generality in the following it is assumed δ 0 and δ δ 2 2 aim of dimensionality reduction and evaluation metrics within this framework the aim of the dimensionality reduction is to identify an approximated representation of the shape modification vector namely δ ˆ ξ x for which its shape modification depends on a new reduced dimensionality design variable x x r n with n m in general the reconstructed vector δ ˆ ξ x is estimated during a process of encoding decoding by the dimensionality reduction method the shape modification vector δ ξ u is encoded in a low dimensional latent space spanned by a new design variable x subsequently the decoding process reconstructs the original shape modification vector as δ ˆ ξ x fig 2 shows an example with the notation for n 1 and m 2 a common metrics to evaluate the quality of δ ˆ ξ x compared to δ ξ u is the mean squared error mse normalized to the total geometric variance σ 2 as 4 nmse mse σ 2 u x g δ ξ u δ ˆ ξ x 2 p u x d ξ d u d x u g δ ξ u 2 p u d ξ d u where p u x is an unknown joint probability distribution over the product space u x 2 3 karhunen loève expansion and principal component analysis at the continuous level an optimal linear representation of the shape modification vector is provided by its kle diez et al 2015 as 5 δ ˆ ξ x i 1 n x i φ i ξ where φ i are the eigensolutions of the fredholm integral equation of the second kind 6 g δ ξ u δ ψ u φ ψ d ψ λ φ ξ where indicates the outer product discretizing g by a number of q elements of equal measure δ g assuming for the sake of simplicity and without loss of generality δ g 1 and sampling u by a statistically convergent number of monte carlo mc realizations s so that u k k 1 s p u the spatial discretization d u k of δ ξ u k are organized in a s l data matrix as 7 d d u k 1 t d u k s t where l m q to simplify the notation in the following d u and d ˆ x are referred to as simply d and d ˆ respectively at the discrete level the integral problem in eq 6 reduces to solving the pca of d the principal components are defined by the solution of the eigenproblem 8 c z i λ i z i i 1 l where 9 c 1 s d t d is the l l covariance matrix pca allows to reduce the input dimensionality of the data performing a projection of data points in a new linear subspace defined by the orthonormal eigenvectors principal components of c these eigenvectors have the properties of maximizing the geometric variance of points projected on them and minimizing the mean squared distance between the original points and the relative projections moreover the eigenvalues λ i i 1 l with λ i λ i 1 represent the variance resolved along the associate eigenvectors z i i 1 l additionally 10 σ 2 i 1 λ i from this property a subset of n eigenvectors is used to compute a reduced dimensionality representation of the original vector d as 11 d ˆ k z x k where the matrix z has dimension l n and is composed by the first n largest variance principal components eq 11 represents the desired reparameterization of the shape modification vector by kle pca where d ˆ k represents the minimum squared error approximation of d k and the new design variables x k are given by 12 x k z t d k the discrete form of the nmse in eq 4 reads 13 nmse 1 s k 1 s d k d ˆ k 2 1 s k 1 s d k 2 1 s k 1 s d k 2 i 1 n z i t c z i 1 s k 1 s d k 2 which holds if one uses either a validation set or the training set for the assessment in the latter case eq 13 can be written as 14 nmse 1 i 1 n λ i 1 s k 1 s d k 2 it may be noted that in principle eqs 7 14 still hold if data standardization is used i e if a data matrix with unit variance columns is processed although this is a standard procedure to analyze heterogeneous and discrete data with pca and or non supervised machine learning methods this would change the hilbert space and the associated norm embedding the analysis and the definition of geometric variance in eq 3 modifying the key metrics the dimensionality reduction is based upon diez et al 2015 as a consequence the resulting reduced dimensionality representation of δ would not be optimal anymore to resolve the geometric variance associated to the original design space in this regard eqs 7 14 for discrete data derive directly from eqs 1 6 defined for continuous variables in particular pca eq 8 is the discrete counterpart of kle integral equation eq 6 therefore data and covariance matrices should not be standardized if an approximate discrete solution of eq 6 is sought after equations and examples of the use of generalized hilbert spaces at the continuous level are given in diez et al 2015 3 shape modification methods it is often convenient in the context of sbdo to apply shape modification methods that allow also for the modification of the computational grid without need for regridding from scratch this usually overcomes the difficulties and bottle necks associated to regridding of new designs sieger et al 2014 modification methods that modify not only the object shape but also the space embedding the object usually allows for automatic grid modification 1 the grid has not to be regenerated from scratch each time the object shape is modified 2 the initial topology is usually preserved and 3 parts of the object can be deformed with a prescribed degree of continuity here three common approaches to shape and grid modification are applied as described in the following these methods are suitable candidates for demonstrating shape reparameterization by kle pca since they allow for the use of a possibly infinite number of design variables 3 1 free form deformation ffd has been widely used in many technological fields menzel and sendhoff 2008 campana et al 2009 diez et al 2015 chen et al 2015 the technique was first described in sederberg and parry 1986 and is based on an earlier study described in barr 1984 the idea is to embed an object within a trapezoidal or other topology lattice and modify the object within the trapezoid as the lattice is modified a coordinate system is assumed with origin ξ 0 at one of the trapezoid vertices any point within the trapezoid has α β and γ coordinates such that 15 ξ ξ 0 α t ˆ 1 β t ˆ 2 γ t ˆ 3 with α β and γ bounded by 0 1 and given by α t ˆ 2 t ˆ 3 ξ ξ 0 t ˆ 2 t ˆ 3 t ˆ 1 β t ˆ 1 t ˆ 3 ξ ξ 0 t ˆ 1 t ˆ 3 t ˆ 2 16 γ t ˆ 1 t ˆ 2 ξ ξ 0 t ˆ 1 t ˆ 2 t ˆ 3 control points cps c i j k are defined as lattice nodes the number of cps used in t ˆ 1 t ˆ 2 and t ˆ 3 directions are t 1 t 2 and t 3 respectively the coordinates of modified cps depend on the original lattice nodes and the design variable vector as 17 c i j k u ξ 0 i t 1 t ˆ 1 j t 2 t ˆ 2 k t 3 t ˆ 3 u i j k the shape modification is achieved by interpolating the cps modification over the embedding space the interpolation can be performed using different polynomial bases herein a tensor product of trivariate bernstein polynomial is used sederberg and parry 1986 18 δ ξ u i 0 t 1 j 0 t 2 k 0 t 3 b i t 1 α b j t 2 β b k t 3 γ c i j k u ξ where the generic bernstein basis polynomials is defined as 19 b v r χ r v χ v 1 χ r v on the one hand the ffd can be applied to any computational grid topology and is suitable for a variety of analysis codes on the other hand the variables associated to the cps modification may have little or no physical meaning to the design engineers thereby making it difficult to define an effective design space 3 2 radial basis function the shape modification is defined starting from given modifications at specified cps which are usually nodes of the discretized object surface the rbf interpolation is based on three sets of coordinates original and modified cps c j and c j u c j u j respectively surface nodes ξ i i 1 q of the original discretized shape and additional conditions if necessary the goal is to find updated surface node positions all over the whole geometry treating the shape modification problem as a scattered data interpolation problem the shape modification function δ ξ u exactly interpolates the prescribed displacements at a given cp u i and smoothly interpolates these displacements onto the geometry the shape modification function is defined as a linear combination of radially symmetric kernel functions φ j ξ φ ξ c j centered in c j and weighted by w j r 3 plus a linear polynomial to guarantee linear precision such that 20 δ ξ u j 1 m w j φ j ξ k 1 4 q k π k ξ where π 1 π 2 π 3 π 4 ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ 3 1 is a basis of the space of linear trivariate polynomials weighted by coefficients q k r 3 sieger et al 2014 the weights w j and q k are found imposing ξ j c j and solving the m 4 m 4 linear system 21 a w b where a φ 1 c 1 φ m c 1 π 1 c 1 π 4 c 1 φ 1 c m φ m c m π 1

includes gaussian multiquadric and inverse multiquadric as summarized in table 1 rbf can be applied on the whole object or a part of it moreover the associated design variables can be related to a physical meaning since cps displacement is directly related to the shape modification in that regions 3 3 global modification function the shape modification δ ξ u is defined using a linear combination of m vector valued functions of the cartesian coordinates ξ r 3 over a hyper rectangle embedding the object serani et al 2016a 23 ϕ i ξ v 0 l ξ 1 0 l ξ 2 0 l ξ 3 r 3 r 3 with i 1 m as 24 δ ξ u i 1 m u i ϕ i ξ where the coefficients u i r i 1 m are the design variables and 25 ϕ i ξ j 1 3 sin a i j π ξ j l ξ j r i j e q i imposing the following orthogonality property 26 v ϕ i ξ ϕ k ξ d ξ δ i k in eq 25 a i j j 1 3 r define the order of the function along j th axis r i j j 1 3 r are the corresponding spatial phases l ξ j j 1 3 are the hyper rectangle edge lengths e q i is a unit vector shape modifications can be applied along ξ 1 ξ 2 or ξ 3 with q i 1 2 or 3 respectively on the one hand gmf is independent of computational grid topology on the other hand there is not a direct physical meaning associated to the shape modification 4 demonstration application the off line dimensionality reduction method is applied for the shape reparameterization and hull form optimization of the dtmb 5415 model see fig 3 main particulars of the model scale and optimization condition are summarized in table 2 since no rudder is considered here the length between perpendiculars l pp is calculated from the fore perpendicular to the transom bottom edge 4 1 optimization problem the problem formulation for the shape optimization of the dtmb 5415 reads 27 minimize r t u with u r m subject to l pp u l pp 0 and to u 0 δ b u 0 05 b 0 δ t u 0 05 t 0 v u v 0 u i l u i u i u i 1 m where r t is the calm water resistance at fr 0 28 equivalent to 20 kn for the full scale ship equality constraints are defined for the l pp and for the displacement inequality constraints include 5 of maximum variation of beam b and the drought t and dedicated volume for the sonar dome v corresponding to 4 9 m diameter and 1 7 m length cylinder subscript 0 indicates original geometry values equality and inequality constraints on the geometry deformations are based on campana et al 2018 using the reduced dimensionality design space the optimization problem eq 27 is recast as 28 minimize r t x with x r n subject to l pp x l pp 0 and to x 0 δ b x 0 05 b 0 δ t x 0 05 t 0 v x v 0 x i l x i x i u i 1 n with x i l inf z i t d and x i u sup z i t d 4 2 design spaces setup and data preprocessing three design spaces are used based on ffd rbf and gmf defined by m 100 25 and 27 design variables respectively details of shape modification parameters setup are summarized in tables 3 4 and 5 fig 4a and b show respectively the ffd and rbf control points blue dots represent active cps whose coordinates are modified during the optimization whereas red octahedra represents cps with fixed coordinates the latter are used to constrain the shape modification at the intersection with the symmetry plane ξ 2 0 the number and the coordinates of cps are chosen to generate global modifications of the hull finally an example of the modification obtained by gmf is shown fig 4c for all the methods shape modifications are defined to produce geometry deformation in ξ 2 direction direction perpendicular to the symmetry plane only the number of design variables is chosen based on the quality of the shape modification obtained by each method different methods use different number of design variables the design variables bounds see tables 3 4 and 5 are set considering the trade off between a producing a meaningful and regular shape and b allowing shape modification variability as large as possible finally to satisfy the equality constraints in eq 27 the following scaling equations are applied to the modified shapes ξ 1 ξ 1 l pp 0 l pp ξ 2 ξ 2 0 l pp l pp 0 29 ξ 3 ξ 3 t 0 0 l pp 0 l pp b 0 b 0 t 0 moreover designs not satisfying the inequality constraints in eq 27 are not included in the data matrix see eq 7 as a results all designs processed by pca are feasible the idea is to define an optimal basis for the representation of the feasible domain nevertheless there are no guarantees that all geometries are feasible during the optimization the design spaces are sampled following a uniform random distribution of s 40000 hull form designs by the mc method the data matrix d collects a l 1800 grids points from hull discretization the design spaces feasibility with respect to geometric constraints is shown in table 6 design space 3 based on gmf has the highest feasibility 16 5 followed by design space 2 based on rbf 12 6 whereas the design space 1 based on ffd achieves the lowest number of feasible geometries 6 4 finally a subset of 2000 feasible designs is randomly selected no bias is introduced they are used to define the design spaces data matrices with dimension 2000 1800 and compare the results 4 3 hydrodynamic solver the calm water total resistance is evaluated using the linear potential flow code warp wave resistance program developed at cnr inm wave resistance computations are based on the dawson double model linearization dawson 1977 the frictional resistance is estimated using a flat plate approximation based on the local reynolds number schlichting and gersten 2000 the ship balance sinkage and trim is fixed details of equations numerical implementations and validation of the numerical solver are given in bassanini et al 1994 simulations are performed for the right demi hull taking advantage of symmetry about the ξ 1 ξ 3 plane the computational domain for the free surface is defined within 1 l pp upstream 3 l pp downstream and 1 5 l pp sideways for a total of 150 44 grid nodes the associated hull grid if formed by 180 40 nodes 4 4 optimization algorithm and setup as global optimizer a deterministic particle swarm optimization dpso serani et al 2016b is used it is formulated as follows 30 v j k 1 χ v j k c 1 p j x j

respectively the social and cognitive learning rate p j is the personal best position ever found by the j th particle in the previous iterations and g is the global best position ever found in the previous iterations by all the particles a discussion for an effective and efficient use of dpso for sbdo in ship hydrodynamics has been presented in serani and diez 2017b the parameter setup used for dpso is selected as suggested in serani et al 2016b number of particles n p 4 n particle initialization with hammersley sequence sampling hss distribution on domain only with non null velocity set of coefficients equal to χ 0 721 c 1 c 2 1 655 semi elastic wall type approach for box constraints a fixed and limited budget of 1000 function evaluations is used 5 numerical results design space assessment and dimensionality reduction results along with simulation based optimization outcomes are presented and discussed in the following subsections 5 1 design space assessment and dimensionality reduction the design space assessment and dimensionality reduction is based on the pca eigenvalues and eigenvectors the former identify the original design space variability retained see eq 10 whereas the latter define the reconstruction error through projection see eq 13 herein the reduced dimensionality n is set so as to achieve a nmse 5 equivalent at least to the 95 of the original design space variability the reduced dimensionality models are validated using a 10 fold cross validation procedure ross 2014 training and test sets are composed by 90 and 10 respectively of the 2000 mc items fig 5 presents the variance retained by the first n pca eigenvectors which equals the pca eigenvalues cumulative sum it can be seen how with current settings and design variable bounds design space 3 gmf achieves the highest design variability whereas design space 2 rbf achieves the lowest specifically design space 3 achieves a geometric variance that is about twice and about one and a half times that obtained by design spaces 2 rbf and 1 ffd respectively this can be justified by the gmf formulation since it is intrinsically global whereas both ffd and rbf are local and limited by the number and position of cps first five pca eigenvectors are shown in fig 6 for each design space specifically the most important eigenvectors for each design space parameterization show the type and order of variations addressed with each design space this comparison emphasizes the difference in variations produced by the different design spaces for instance the setup for design spaces 1 and 3 based on the current implementation of ffd and gmf respectively provides with more global shape modifications with significant variations in sectional area and waterline along the ship length the design space 2 based on rbf gives more localized modifications close to the bow and the stern the design space dimensionality reduction convergence versus the number of mc samples s is shown in fig 7 in terms of nmse as a function of the reduced dimensionality space dimension n training and test sets results are shown in fig 7a and b respectively the results are found convergent versus s for all the shape modification methods the three design spaces have been reduced up to n 14 design space 1 21 design space 2 and 17 design space 3 design variables respectively the design space 1 based on ffd shows the highest dimensionality reduction 86 followed by the design space 3 based on gmf 37 and finally the design space 2 based on rbf 16 shape reparameterization results are summarized in table 7 an example of shape reconstruction of a target geometry one of the 2000 mc items and the corresponding reconstruction error using the reduced dimensionality design spaces is shown in fig 8 for each design space the target geometry is quite extreme and not realistic and used as challenging test for demonstration no significant differences between target and reconstructed hulls can be observed with low values of the reconstruction error based on the current design spaces setup the results underline that 1 overall the gmf method is capable to provide the highest design space variance see fig 5 2 the ffd method defines a highly linearly dependent design space since it achieves a significant dimensionality reduction see table 7 finally gmf and rbf relatively low dimensionality reduction values show the difficulty to reduced the design space dimensionality if the original space is suitably well defined this means that independently of the shape modification method if the original design space is defined by a basis of linearly independent shape modification vectors the kle pca cannot provide with any dimensionality reduction 5 2 optimization to assess the effects of the reduced dimensionality spaces on the hull form optimization of the dtmb 5415 three analysis are carried out for each design space 1 a preliminary sensitivity analysis along the 1st pca eigenvector 2 an sbdo procedure using two reduced dimensionality design spaces with n 8 and the value providing nmse 5 respectively 3 an sbdo procedure using the original design space the sensitivity analysis along the 1st pca eigenvector is shown in fig 9 the reduced design variable x 1 is normalized between 1 and 1 the design space 1 provides the highest objective improvement about 6 followed by design space 3 3 5 whereas design space 2 produces an improvement lower than 0 1 these is in agreement with the results of the design spaces assessment the improvement ranking corresponds to the variance retained by 1st pca eigenvector ranking see fig 5 fig 10 shows the comparison of the optimization convergence conditional to the design space using two reduced dimensionality spaces and the original one n 8 14 and m 100 for design space 1 n 8 21 and m 25 for design space 2 n 8 17 and m 27 for design space 3 shape reparameterization by reduced dimensionality spaces provides a larger objective improvement than the original design space except for design space 3 with n 17 it may be noted that the optimization runs are performed using a fixed and intentionally limited budget of function evaluations meaning that the optimization algorithm is far from the convergence a comparison of the design space best optima hull stations and wave elevation η patterns to the original is shown in figs 11 and 12 the highest resistance reduction achieved by the design space 1 n 14 can be associated with a significant modification reduction of the sonar dome area see fig 11a and a reduction of both diverging and transverse stern waves see fig 12b the optimization results are summarized in table 8 finally fig 13 shows the resistance reduction as a function of the geometric variance retained by each design space its linear regression lr show how the resistance decreases as the geometric variance increases nevertheless considering different design spaces a greater geometric variability is not always associated with a greater improvement of the objective function this can be justified by the absence of physic based information in the dimensionality reduction procedure which is based on geometric variables only it can be also noted how the ffd search for global optimum with 100 design variables consumes the entire evaluation budget without achieving any objective improvement nevertheless its reduced dimensionality space with n 14 and almost the same geometric variance achieves the best design overall highlighting the potentiality of the method 6 conclusions and future work a method based on the karhunen loève expansion has been presented for the assessment of arbitrary design spaces in shape optimization assessing the shape modification variability and providing the definition of a reduced dimensionality global model of the shape modification vector the method is based on the concept of geometric variance and does not require simulations and or design performance analyses at the continuous level the kle is applied to the continuous shape modification vector assuming stochastic design variables at the discrete level the problem reduces to the pca of a discrete set of geometrical data specifically the kle problem is formulated in the continuous domain and reduces to the eigenproblem of an integral operator representing a fredholm integral equation of the second kind the discretization of the shape domain and associated integral equation yields the eigenproblem of a matrix which appears to be the autocovariance matrix of the discretized shape modification vector finally this corresponds to solving the pca of the discretized shape modification vector the present work has demonstrated how the method can be used to assess different design spaces and shape parameterization methods before optimization is performed and without the need of running simulations for the performance prediction and or its gradient the method has been further used to reduce the dimensionality of design spaces based on kle pca eigenvalues providing a shape reparameterization using kle pca eigenmodes these are finally used for simulation based design optimization aiming at global optimum a demonstration for the hull form optimization of the dtmb 5415 model in calm water has been discussed where three design spaces were investigated these were provided by ffd rbf and gmf with current settings ffd rbf and gmf design space dimensionality was reduced by 86 16 and 37 respectively allowing for a nmse of 5 corresponding to the 95 of reconstructed geometric variance current results have shown the effectiveness of the method in defining efficient design spaces under the assumption of limited budget of function evaluations as often encountered in sbdo problems reduced dimensionality spaces have achieved in general larger objective improvements than the original parameterizations specifically the latter have provided 0 design space 1 ffd 3 2 design space 2 rbf and 4 4 design space 3 gmf resistance reduction whereas reduced dimensionality spaces have given 17 design space 1 4 4 design space 2 and 6 design space 3 it is a notable result that with the given budget of function evaluations the global optimization algorithm is not able to provide with any objective improvement using the original ffd method with m 100 design variables the design space dimensionality reduction of the ffd parameterization reduced the number of design variables to n 14 and drove the global optimizer to the best overall optimum among all cases studied here fig 13 in general it may be noted that the geometric variance is not always proportional to the objective variation or improvement therefore it is not straightforward to state based on the geometric variance only whether a parameterization method with associated setup is better than another one or not in the search for a global optimum for instance design space 3 have provided the highest design variability feasibility but this was not associated to the largest objective improvement which was achieved by design space 1 these results show how the process of defining an efficient and effective design space can be complex and how a proper definition of the shape modification method is always advisable the method presented here goes beyond the current application and is suitable in all areas where shape design is of primary importance such as aerodynamics structures and heat transfer applications involving complex single and multi disciplinary simulations facing multiple environmental and operating conditions finally it may noted that significant physical phenomena induced by small shape modifications such as transitions separations etc may be overlooked as no physical information is processed by the method which justifies the fact that retaining a large geometric variance is not always associated to achieving better objective function values the inclusion of physics based information in the dimensionality reduction formulation has been presented and discussed in diez et al 2016b serani et al 2017a and serani and diez 2018b and is part of ongoing research furthermore linear methods such as kle pca may not be efficient when a complex non linear relationship between design variables is involved an extension to non linear dimensionality reduction methods and their effects on shape optimization have been discussed in d agostino et al 2018a b and d agostino et al 2018c the use of non linear methods with combined geometry and physics based data has been presented in d agostino et al 2019 and serani et al 2019 and is the subject of ongoing studies declaration of competing interest the authors declare

22175,a method based on the karhunen loève expansion kle is formulated for the assessment of arbitrary design spaces in shape optimization assessing the shape modification variability and providing the definition of a reduced dimensionality global model of the shape modification vector the method is based on the concept of geometric variance and does not require design performance analyses specifically the kle is applied to the continuous shape modification vector requiring the solution of a fredholm integral equation of the second kind once the equation is discretized the problem reduces to the principal component analysis pca of discrete geometrical data the objective of the present work is to demonstrate how this method can be used to a assess different design spaces and shape parameterization methods before optimization is performed and without the need of running simulations for the performance prediction and b reduce the dimensionality of the design space providing a shape reparameterization using kle pca eigenvalues and eigenmodes a demonstration for the hull form optimization of the dtmb 5415 model in calm water is shown where three design spaces are investigated namely provided by free form deformation radial basis functions and global modification functions keywords shape parameterization design space dimensionality reduction karhunen loève expansion proper orthogonal decomposition principal component analysis simulation based design optimization 1 introduction the simulation based design sbd paradigm has demonstrated the capability of supporting ship designers and marine ocean engineers not only providing large sets of design options but also exploring operational spaces by assessing the design performance for a large number of operating and environmental conditions the recent development of high performance computing hpc systems has driven the sbd towards integration with optimization algorithms and uncertainty quantification uq methods moving the sbd paradigm to automatic deterministic and stochastic sbd optimization sbdo campana et al 2006 diez et al 2018 and simulation driven sdd harries and abt 2019 formulations possibly aiming at global solutions to the design problem in shape design sbdo consists of three main elements as shown in fig 1 see right box i a deterministic and or stochastic simulation tool integrating physics based solvers with uq ii an optimization algorithm and iii a shape modification tool despite the increased computational power and robustness of numerical algorithms high fidelity sbdo for shape optimization still remains a challenging process from theoretical algorithmic and technological viewpoints among others one of the most complex challenge is how to deal with high dimensional large design spaces especially when computationally expensive black box functions are used for the performance analysis and a global optimum is sought after potential design improvements significantly depend on dimension and extension of the design space obviously high dimensionality and variability spaces are more difficult and expensive to explore but at the same time potentially allow for bigger improvements even if efficient global optimization algorithms have been proposed jones et al 1993 serani and diez 2018a and applied with success to sbdo campana et al 2015 serani et al 2016a finding a potentially global optimal solution within reasonable computational time cost remains a critical issue and a technological challenge additionally uq of complex applications is computationally very demanding especially if high order statistical moments and or quantiles need to be assessed as in robust and reliability based design optimization both global optimization and uq are affected by the curse of dimensionality as the algorithms complexity and computational cost rapidly increase with the problem dimension this is generally also true if metamodels are applied therefore the assessment and breakdown of the design space dimensionality are key elements for the efficiency and affordability of the sbdo diez et al 2015 in this context shape optimization research has traditionally focused on shape and topology parameterizations as critical factors to achieve the desired level of design variability rozvany et al 1992 bletzinger and maute 1997 samareh 2001 obviously the choice of the shape parameterization technique has a large impact on the practical implementation and the success of the optimization process shape deformation methods have been an area of continuous and extensive research within the fields of computer graphics and geometry modeling consequently a wide variety of techniques has been proposed during recent years sieger et al 2015 several techniques have been developed and applied samareh 2001 such as basis vector methods pickett jr et al 1973 domain element and discrete approaches leiva and watson 1998 partial differential equation bloor and wilson 1995 cad based yang 1995 analytical hicks and henne 1978 polynomials haftka and grandhi 1986 b splines grigoropoulos and chalkias 2010 non uniform rational bezier spline nurbs patches of bezier surfaces campana et al 2006 free form deformation ffd sederberg and parry 1986 and morphing approaches kandasamy et al 2013 in order for the sbdo to avoid the curse of dimensionality and be successful the parameterization method must efficiently describe the design variability with as few variables as possible however in most of past sbdo literature the trade off between geometric variability and design space dimensionality is not directly quantitatively addressed or only qualitatively assessed in order to solve complex and computationally demanding optimization problems on line linear design space dimensionality reduction techniques have been developed requiring the evaluation of the objective function or its gradient principal component analysis pca or proper orthogonal decomposition pod methods have been applied for local reduced dimensionality representations of feasible design regions raghavan et al 2013a b the associated pod pca based expansions are not truncated and the dimensionality reduction is achieved by a local representation of an α manifold of feasible designs embedding therefore the design constraints whose evaluation is required in the design parameterization and preserving the original feasible design variability a pca pod based approach is used in the active subspace method lukaczyk et al 2014 to discover and exploit low dimensional monotonic trends in the objective function based on the evaluation of its gradient this type of methods improve the optimization efficiency by basis rotation and or dimensionality reduction nevertheless they do not provide an assessment of the design space and associated shape parameterization before optimization is performed or objective function and or gradient are evaluated moreover if gradients are not directly provided as in the case of black box tools their evaluation by finite differences can be inaccurate due to numerical noise and or residuals affecting the solution finally these methods are local in nature and their extension to global optimization is not trivial nor straightforward off line or up front linear models have been developed with focus on design space variability and dimensionality reduction for efficient optimization procedures in borzì et al 2010 and schillings et al 2011 the karhunen loève expansion kle equivalent to pod is used for representing distributed geometrical uncertainties and building a reduced order spatial model for uq a method based on the kle has been formulated in diez et al 2015 for the assessment of the shape modification variability and the definition of a reduced dimensionality global model of the shape modification vector for arbitrary modification methods no objective function evaluation nor gradient is required by the method as this is entirely based on the concept of geometric variance kle is formulated in the continuous domain and reduces to the eigenproblem of an integral operator representing a fredholm integral equation of the second kind the discretization of the shape domain and associated integral equation yields the eigenproblem of a matrix which appears to be the autocovariance matrix of the discretized shape modification vector this corresponds to solving the pca of the discretized shape modification vector kle pca methods have been successfully applied for deterministic chen et al 2015 diez et al 2016a serani et al 2016a and stochastic diez et al 2018 hull form optimization of mono hulls and catamarans in calm water and waves respectively similarly poole et al 2017 have applied pod to airfoil shape optimization via singular value decomposition svd of an airfoil geometric data library off line methods improve the shape optimization efficiency by reparameterization and dimensionality reduction providing the assessment of the design space and the shape parameterization before optimization and or performance analysis are carried out the assessment is based on the geometric variability associated to the design space making the method fully off line and computationally very efficient and attractive as no simulations are required theory and mathematical derivation of design variability breakdown associated confidence levels and dimensionality reduction for hydrodynamic shape optimization still remain limited applications to ship hydrodynamic optimization are also limited the objective of the present work is to demonstrate how off line kle pca methods based on the concept on geometric variance can be used to assess different design spaces and shape parameterization methods before optimization is performed and without needing to run simulations for the design performance prediction the method is further exploited to reduce the dimensionality of the design spaces based on the kle pca eigenvalues providing an efficient shape reparameterization using kle pca eigenmodes the approach is shown in fig 1 the left box includes the elements of the geometry based formulation of the pre optimization off line design space dimensionality reduction method the right box represents a typical optimization loop including shape modification analysis tool e g computational fluid dynamics finite element analysis possibly coupled with uq and optimization algorithm whose detailed description is beyond the scope of the current work the method is demonstrated for the hull form optimization of the dtmb 5415 model an early and open to public version of the uss arleigh burke destroyer ddg 51 extensively used as an international benchmark for shape optimization problems e g campana et al 2018 hirsch et al 2018 the optimization aims at the reduction of the model scale calm water resistance at froude number equal to 0 28 simulations are based on a potential flow code with viscous correction three design spaces are investigated namely provided by ffd radial basis functions rbf and global modification functions gmf it may be noted that the objective of the investigation is not the comparison of different shape modification methods per se but the demonstration of how kle pca can be used to assess and compare different design spaces provided by arbitrary modification methods an example of comparison by kle pca of design spaces defined using the same modification method namely ffd is given in diez et al 2015 2 dimensionality reduction method general definitions and assumptions for design space assessment and dimensionality reduction are presented in the following for further details on the theory and implementation the interested reader is referred to diez et al 2015 2 1 general definitions and assumptions consider a geometric domain g which identifies the original or parent shape and a set of coordinates ξ g r n with n 1 2 3 assume that u u r m is the design variable vector which defines a continuous shape modification vector δ ξ u r m with m 1 2 3 with m not necessarily equal to n each ξ g is transformed in ξ g as 1 ξ ξ δ ξ u where g and g represent the original and modified shapes respectively see fig 2 consider u as a random variable with associated probability density function p u this corresponds to formulating the optimization problem as a problem affected by epistemic uncertainty in the sense that before solving the problem the optimal solution is yet unknown in this context the distribution p u represents the prior probability of finding an optimal solution in a given region of the design space although its definition can be based on experience and or earlier studies it is often not trivial and therefore the prior is usually defined as a uniform distribution function therefore giving each point in the design space the same probability to be an optimal solution the mean shape modification associated to p u is 2 δ u δ ξ u p u d u whereas the variance associated to the shape modification vector geometric variance is defined as 3 σ 2 δ 2 u g δ ξ u δ ξ u p u d ξ d u where δ δ δ for the sake of simplicity and without loss of generality in the following it is assumed δ 0 and δ δ 2 2 aim of dimensionality reduction and evaluation metrics within this framework the aim of the dimensionality reduction is to identify an approximated representation of the shape modification vector namely δ ˆ ξ x for which its shape modification depends on a new reduced dimensionality design variable x x r n with n m in general the reconstructed vector δ ˆ ξ x is estimated during a process of encoding decoding by the dimensionality reduction method the shape modification vector δ ξ u is encoded in a low dimensional latent space spanned by a new design variable x subsequently the decoding process reconstructs the original shape modification vector as δ ˆ ξ x fig 2 shows an example with the notation for n 1 and m 2 a common metrics to evaluate the quality of δ ˆ ξ x compared to δ ξ u is the mean squared error mse normalized to the total geometric variance σ 2 as 4 nmse mse σ 2 u x g δ ξ u δ ˆ ξ x 2 p u x d ξ d u d x u g δ ξ u 2 p u d ξ d u where p u x is an unknown joint probability distribution over the product space u x 2 3 karhunen loève expansion and principal component analysis at the continuous level an optimal linear representation of the shape modification vector is provided by its kle diez et al 2015 as 5 δ ˆ ξ x i 1 n x i φ i ξ where φ i are the eigensolutions of the fredholm integral equation of the second kind 6 g δ ξ u δ ψ u φ ψ d ψ λ φ ξ where indicates the outer product discretizing g by a number of q elements of equal measure δ g assuming for the sake of simplicity and without loss of generality δ g 1 and sampling u by a statistically convergent number of monte carlo mc realizations s so that u k k 1 s p u the spatial discretization d u k of δ ξ u k are organized in a s l data matrix as 7 d d u k 1 t d u k s t where l m q to simplify the notation in the following d u and d ˆ x are referred to as simply d and d ˆ respectively at the discrete level the integral problem in eq 6 reduces to solving the pca of d the principal components are defined by the solution of the eigenproblem 8 c z i λ i z i i 1 l where 9 c 1 s d t d is the l l covariance matrix pca allows to reduce the input dimensionality of the data performing a projection of data points in a new linear subspace defined by the orthonormal eigenvectors principal components of c these eigenvectors have the properties of maximizing the geometric variance of points projected on them and minimizing the mean squared distance between the original points and the relative projections moreover the eigenvalues λ i i 1 l with λ i λ i 1 represent the variance resolved along the associate eigenvectors z i i 1 l additionally 10 σ 2 i 1 λ i from this property a subset of n eigenvectors is used to compute a reduced dimensionality representation of the original vector d as 11 d ˆ k z x k where the matrix z has dimension l n and is composed by the first n largest variance principal components eq 11 represents the desired reparameterization of the shape modification vector by kle pca where d ˆ k represents the minimum squared error approximation of d k and the new design variables x k are given by 12 x k z t d k the discrete form of the nmse in eq 4 reads 13 nmse 1 s k 1 s d k d ˆ k 2 1 s k 1 s d k 2 1 s k 1 s d k 2 i 1 n z i t c z i 1 s k 1 s d k 2 which holds if one uses either a validation set or the training set for the assessment in the latter case eq 13 can be written as 14 nmse 1 i 1 n λ i 1 s k 1 s d k 2 it may be noted that in principle eqs 7 14 still hold if data standardization is used i e if a data matrix with unit variance columns is processed although this is a standard procedure to analyze heterogeneous and discrete data with pca and or non supervised machine learning methods this would change the hilbert space and the associated norm embedding the analysis and the definition of geometric variance in eq 3 modifying the key metrics the dimensionality reduction is based upon diez et al 2015 as a consequence the resulting reduced dimensionality representation of δ would not be optimal anymore to resolve the geometric variance associated to the original design space in this regard eqs 7 14 for discrete data derive directly from eqs 1 6 defined for continuous variables in particular pca eq 8 is the discrete counterpart of kle integral equation eq 6 therefore data and covariance matrices should not be standardized if an approximate discrete solution of eq 6 is sought after equations and examples of the use of generalized hilbert spaces at the continuous level are given in diez et al 2015 3 shape modification methods it is often convenient in the context of sbdo to apply shape modification methods that allow also for the modification of the computational grid without need for regridding from scratch this usually overcomes the difficulties and bottle necks associated to regridding of new designs sieger et al 2014 modification methods that modify not only the object shape but also the space embedding the object usually allows for automatic grid modification 1 the grid has not to be regenerated from scratch each time the object shape is modified 2 the initial topology is usually preserved and 3 parts of the object can be deformed with a prescribed degree of continuity here three common approaches to shape and grid modification are applied as described in the following these methods are suitable candidates for demonstrating shape reparameterization by kle pca since they allow for the use of a possibly infinite number of design variables 3 1 free form deformation ffd has been widely used in many technological fields menzel and sendhoff 2008 campana et al 2009 diez et al 2015 chen et al 2015 the technique was first described in sederberg and parry 1986 and is based on an earlier study described in barr 1984 the idea is to embed an object within a trapezoidal or other topology lattice and modify the object within the trapezoid as the lattice is modified a coordinate system is assumed with origin ξ 0 at one of the trapezoid vertices any point within the trapezoid has α β and γ coordinates such that 15 ξ ξ 0 α t ˆ 1 β t ˆ 2 γ t ˆ 3 with α β and γ bounded by 0 1 and given by α t ˆ 2 t ˆ 3 ξ ξ 0 t ˆ 2 t ˆ 3 t ˆ 1 β t ˆ 1 t ˆ 3 ξ ξ 0 t ˆ 1 t ˆ 3 t ˆ 2 16 γ t ˆ 1 t ˆ 2 ξ ξ 0 t ˆ 1 t ˆ 2 t ˆ 3 control points cps c i j k are defined as lattice nodes the number of cps used in t ˆ 1 t ˆ 2 and t ˆ 3 directions are t 1 t 2 and t 3 respectively the coordinates of modified cps depend on the original lattice nodes and the design variable vector as 17 c i j k u ξ 0 i t 1 t ˆ 1 j t 2 t ˆ 2 k t 3 t ˆ 3 u i j k the shape modification is achieved by interpolating the cps modification over the embedding space the interpolation can be performed using different polynomial bases herein a tensor product of trivariate bernstein polynomial is used sederberg and parry 1986 18 δ ξ u i 0 t 1 j 0 t 2 k 0 t 3 b i t 1 α b j t 2 β b k t 3 γ c i j k u ξ where the generic bernstein basis polynomials is defined as 19 b v r χ r v χ v 1 χ r v on the one hand the ffd can be applied to any computational grid topology and is suitable for a variety of analysis codes on the other hand the variables associated to the cps modification may have little or no physical meaning to the design engineers thereby making it difficult to define an effective design space 3 2 radial basis function the shape modification is defined starting from given modifications at specified cps which are usually nodes of the discretized object surface the rbf interpolation is based on three sets of coordinates original and modified cps c j and c j u c j u j respectively surface nodes ξ i i 1 q of the original discretized shape and additional conditions if necessary the goal is to find updated surface node positions all over the whole geometry treating the shape modification problem as a scattered data interpolation problem the shape modification function δ ξ u exactly interpolates the prescribed displacements at a given cp u i and smoothly interpolates these displacements onto the geometry the shape modification function is defined as a linear combination of radially symmetric kernel functions φ j ξ φ ξ c j centered in c j and weighted by w j r 3 plus a linear polynomial to guarantee linear precision such that 20 δ ξ u j 1 m w j φ j ξ k 1 4 q k π k ξ where π 1 π 2 π 3 π 4 ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ 3 1 is a basis of the space of linear trivariate polynomials weighted by coefficients q k r 3 sieger et al 2014 the weights w j and q k are found imposing ξ j c j and solving the m 4 m 4 linear system 21 a w b where a φ 1 c 1 φ m c 1 π 1 c 1 π 4 c 1 φ 1 c m φ m c m π 1

includes gaussian multiquadric and inverse multiquadric as summarized in table 1 rbf can be applied on the whole object or a part of it moreover the associated design variables can be related to a physical meaning since cps displacement is directly related to the shape modification in that regions 3 3 global modification function the shape modification δ ξ u is defined using a linear combination of m vector valued functions of the cartesian coordinates ξ r 3 over a hyper rectangle embedding the object serani et al 2016a 23 ϕ i ξ v 0 l ξ 1 0 l ξ 2 0 l ξ 3 r 3 r 3 with i 1 m as 24 δ ξ u i 1 m u i ϕ i ξ where the coefficients u i r i 1 m are the design variables and 25 ϕ i ξ j 1 3 sin a i j π ξ j l ξ j r i j e q i imposing the following orthogonality property 26 v ϕ i ξ ϕ k ξ d ξ δ i k in eq 25 a i j j 1 3 r define the order of the function along j th axis r i j j 1 3 r are the corresponding spatial phases l ξ j j 1 3 are the hyper rectangle edge lengths e q i is a unit vector shape modifications can be applied along ξ 1 ξ 2 or ξ 3 with q i 1 2 or 3 respectively on the one hand gmf is independent of computational grid topology on the other hand there is not a direct physical meaning associated to the shape modification 4 demonstration application the off line dimensionality reduction method is applied for the shape reparameterization and hull form optimization of the dtmb 5415 model see fig 3 main particulars of the model scale and optimization condition are summarized in table 2 since no rudder is considered here the length between perpendiculars l pp is calculated from the fore perpendicular to the transom bottom edge 4 1 optimization problem the problem formulation for the shape optimization of the dtmb 5415 reads 27 minimize r t u with u r m subject to l pp u l pp 0 and to u 0 δ b u 0 05 b 0 δ t u 0 05 t 0 v u v 0 u i l u i u i u i 1 m where r t is the calm water resistance at fr 0 28 equivalent to 20 kn for the full scale ship equality constraints are defined for the l pp and for the displacement inequality constraints include 5 of maximum variation of beam b and the drought t and dedicated volume for the sonar dome v corresponding to 4 9 m diameter and 1 7 m length cylinder subscript 0 indicates original geometry values equality and inequality constraints on the geometry deformations are based on campana et al 2018 using the reduced dimensionality design space the optimization problem eq 27 is recast as 28 minimize r t x with x r n subject to l pp x l pp 0 and to x 0 δ b x 0 05 b 0 δ t x 0 05 t 0 v x v 0 x i l x i x i u i 1 n with x i l inf z i t d and x i u sup z i t d 4 2 design spaces setup and data preprocessing three design spaces are used based on ffd rbf and gmf defined by m 100 25 and 27 design variables respectively details of shape modification parameters setup are summarized in tables 3 4 and 5 fig 4a and b show respectively the ffd and rbf control points blue dots represent active cps whose coordinates are modified during the optimization whereas red octahedra represents cps with fixed coordinates the latter are used to constrain the shape modification at the intersection with the symmetry plane ξ 2 0 the number and the coordinates of cps are chosen to generate global modifications of the hull finally an example of the modification obtained by gmf is shown fig 4c for all the methods shape modifications are defined to produce geometry deformation in ξ 2 direction direction perpendicular to the symmetry plane only the number of design variables is chosen based on the quality of the shape modification obtained by each method different methods use different number of design variables the design variables bounds see tables 3 4 and 5 are set considering the trade off between a producing a meaningful and regular shape and b allowing shape modification variability as large as possible finally to satisfy the equality constraints in eq 27 the following scaling equations are applied to the modified shapes ξ 1 ξ 1 l pp 0 l pp ξ 2 ξ 2 0 l pp l pp 0 29 ξ 3 ξ 3 t 0 0 l pp 0 l pp b 0 b 0 t 0 moreover designs not satisfying the inequality constraints in eq 27 are not included in the data matrix see eq 7 as a results all designs processed by pca are feasible the idea is to define an optimal basis for the representation of the feasible domain nevertheless there are no guarantees that all geometries are feasible during the optimization the design spaces are sampled following a uniform random distribution of s 40000 hull form designs by the mc method the data matrix d collects a l 1800 grids points from hull discretization the design spaces feasibility with respect to geometric constraints is shown in table 6 design space 3 based on gmf has the highest feasibility 16 5 followed by design space 2 based on rbf 12 6 whereas the design space 1 based on ffd achieves the lowest number of feasible geometries 6 4 finally a subset of 2000 feasible designs is randomly selected no bias is introduced they are used to define the design spaces data matrices with dimension 2000 1800 and compare the results 4 3 hydrodynamic solver the calm water total resistance is evaluated using the linear potential flow code warp wave resistance program developed at cnr inm wave resistance computations are based on the dawson double model linearization dawson 1977 the frictional resistance is estimated using a flat plate approximation based on the local reynolds number schlichting and gersten 2000 the ship balance sinkage and trim is fixed details of equations numerical implementations and validation of the numerical solver are given in bassanini et al 1994 simulations are performed for the right demi hull taking advantage of symmetry about the ξ 1 ξ 3 plane the computational domain for the free surface is defined within 1 l pp upstream 3 l pp downstream and 1 5 l pp sideways for a total of 150 44 grid nodes the associated hull grid if formed by 180 40 nodes 4 4 optimization algorithm and setup as global optimizer a deterministic particle swarm optimization dpso serani et al 2016b is used it is formulated as follows 30 v j k 1 χ v j k c 1 p j x j

respectively the social and cognitive learning rate p j is the personal best position ever found by the j th particle in the previous iterations and g is the global best position ever found in the previous iterations by all the particles a discussion for an effective and efficient use of dpso for sbdo in ship hydrodynamics has been presented in serani and diez 2017b the parameter setup used for

coefficients equal to χ 0 721 c 1 c 2 1 655 semi elastic wall type approach for box constraints a fixed and limited budget of 1000 function evaluations is used 5 numerical results design space assessment and dimensionality reduction results along with simulation based optimization outcomes are presented and discussed in the following subsections 5 1 design space assessment and dimensionality reduction the design space assessment and dimensionality reduction is based on the pca eigenvalues and eigenvectors the former identify the original design space variability retained see eq 10 whereas the latter define the reconstruction error through projection see eq 13 herein the reduced dimensionality n is set so as to achieve a nmse 5 equivalent at least to the 95 of the original design space variability the reduced dimensionality models are validated using a 10 fold cross validation procedure ross 2014 training and test sets are composed by 90 and 10 respectively of the 2000 mc items fig 5 presents the variance retained by the first n pca eigenvectors which equals the pca eigenvalues cumulative sum it can be seen how with current settings and design variable bounds design space 3 gmf achieves the highest design variability whereas design space 2 rbf achieves the lowest specifically design space 3 achieves a geometric variance that is about twice and about one and a half times that obtained by design spaces 2 rbf and 1 ffd respectively this can be justified by the gmf formulation since it is intrinsically global whereas both ffd and rbf are local and limited by the number and position of cps first five pca eigenvectors are shown in fig 6 for each design space specifically the most important eigenvectors for each design space parameterization show the type and order of variations addressed with each design space this comparison emphasizes the difference in variations produced by the different design spaces for instance the setup for design spaces 1 and 3 based on the current implementation of ffd and gmf respectively provides with more global shape modifications with significant variations in sectional area and waterline along the ship length the design space 2 based on rbf gives more localized modifications close to the bow and the stern the design space dimensionality reduction convergence versus the number of mc samples s is shown in fig 7 in terms of nmse as a function of the reduced dimensionality space dimension n training and test sets results are shown in fig 7a and b respectively the results are found convergent versus s for all the shape modification methods the three design spaces have been reduced up to n 14 design space 1 21 design space 2 and 17 design space 3 design variables respectively the design space 1 based on ffd shows the highest dimensionality reduction 86 followed by the design space 3 based on gmf 37 and finally the design space 2 based on rbf 16 shape reparameterization results are summarized in table 7 an example of shape reconstruction of a target geometry one of the 2000 mc items and the corresponding reconstruction error using the reduced dimensionality design spaces is shown in fig 8 for each design space the target geometry is quite extreme and not realistic and used as challenging test for demonstration no significant differences between target and reconstructed hulls can be observed with low values of the reconstruction error based on the current design spaces setup the results underline that 1 overall the gmf method is capable to provide the highest design space variance see fig 5 2 the ffd method defines a highly linearly dependent design space since it achieves a significant dimensionality reduction see table 7 finally gmf and rbf relatively low dimensionality reduction values show the difficulty to reduced the design space dimensionality if the original space is suitably well defined this means that independently of the shape modification method if the original design space is defined by a basis of linearly independent shape modification vectors the kle pca cannot provide with any dimensionality reduction 5 2 optimization to assess the effects of the reduced dimensionality spaces on the hull form optimization of the dtmb 5415 three analysis are carried out for each design space 1 a preliminary sensitivity analysis along the 1st pca eigenvector 2 an sbdo procedure using two reduced dimensionality design spaces with n 8 and the value providing nmse 5 respectively 3 an sbdo procedure using the original design space the sensitivity analysis along the 1st pca eigenvector is shown in fig 9 the reduced design variable x 1 is normalized between 1 and 1 the design space 1 provides the highest objective improvement about 6 followed by design space 3 3 5 whereas design space 2 produces an improvement lower than 0 1 these is in agreement with the results of the design spaces assessment the improvement ranking corresponds to the variance retained by 1st pca eigenvector ranking see fig 5 fig 10 shows the comparison of the optimization convergence conditional to the design space using two reduced dimensionality spaces and the original one n 8 14 and m 100 for design space 1 n 8 21 and m 25 for design space 2 n 8 17 and m 27 for design space 3 shape reparameterization by reduced dimensionality spaces provides a larger objective improvement than the original design space except for design space 3 with n 17 it may be noted that the optimization runs are performed using a fixed and intentionally limited budget of function evaluations meaning that the optimization algorithm is far from the convergence a comparison of the design space best optima hull stations and wave elevation η patterns to the original is shown in figs 11 and 12 the highest resistance reduction achieved by the design space 1 n 14 can be associated with a significant modification reduction of the sonar dome area see fig 11a and a reduction of both diverging and transverse stern waves see fig 12b the optimization results are summarized in table 8 finally fig 13 shows the resistance reduction as a function of the geometric variance retained by each design space its linear regression lr show how the resistance decreases as the geometric variance increases nevertheless considering different design spaces a greater geometric variability is not always associated with a greater improvement of the objective function this can be justified by the absence of physic based information in the dimensionality reduction procedure which is based on geometric variables only it can be also noted how the ffd search for global optimum with 100 design variables consumes the entire evaluation budget without achieving any objective improvement nevertheless its reduced dimensionality space with n 14 and almost the same geometric variance achieves the best design overall highlighting the potentiality of the method 6 conclusions and future work a method based on the karhunen loève expansion has been presented for the assessment of arbitrary design spaces in shape optimization assessing the shape modification variability and providing the definition of a reduced dimensionality global model of the shape modification vector the method is based on the concept of geometric variance and does not require simulations and or design performance analyses at the continuous level the kle is applied to the continuous shape modification vector assuming stochastic design variables at the discrete level the problem reduces to the pca of a discrete set of geometrical data specifically the kle problem is formulated in the continuous domain and reduces to the eigenproblem of an integral operator representing a fredholm integral equation of the second kind the discretization of the shape domain and associated integral equation yields the eigenproblem of a matrix which appears to be the autocovariance matrix of the discretized shape modification vector finally this corresponds to solving the pca of the discretized shape modification vector the present work has demonstrated how the method can be used to assess different design spaces and shape parameterization methods before optimization is performed and without the need of running simulations for the performance prediction and or its gradient the method has been further used to reduce the dimensionality of design spaces based on kle pca eigenvalues providing a shape reparameterization using kle pca eigenmodes these are finally used for simulation based design optimization aiming at global optimum a demonstration for the hull form optimization of the dtmb 5415 model in calm water has been discussed where three design spaces were investigated these were provided by ffd rbf and gmf with current settings ffd rbf and gmf design space dimensionality was reduced by 86 16 and 37 respectively allowing for a nmse of 5 corresponding to the 95 of reconstructed geometric variance current results have shown the effectiveness of the method in defining efficient design spaces under the assumption of limited budget of function evaluations as often encountered in sbdo problems reduced dimensionality spaces have achieved in general larger objective improvements than the original parameterizations specifically the latter have provided 0 design space 1 ffd 3 2 design space 2 rbf and 4 4 design space 3 gmf resistance reduction whereas reduced dimensionality spaces have given 17 design space 1 4 4 design space 2 and 6 design space 3 it is a notable result that with the given budget of function evaluations the global optimization algorithm is not able to provide with any objective improvement using the original ffd method with m 100 design variables the design space dimensionality reduction of the ffd parameterization reduced the number of design variables to n 14 and drove the global optimizer to the best overall optimum among all cases studied here fig 13 in general it may be noted that the geometric variance is not always proportional to the objective variation or improvement therefore it is not straightforward to state based on the geometric variance only whether a parameterization method with associated setup is better than another one or not in the search for a global optimum for instance design space 3 have provided the highest design variability feasibility but this was not associated to the largest objective improvement which was achieved by design space 1 these results show how the process of defining an efficient and effective design space can be complex and how a proper definition of the shape modification method is always advisable the method presented here goes beyond the current application and is suitable in all areas where shape design is of primary importance such as aerodynamics structures and heat transfer applications involving complex single and multi disciplinary simulations facing multiple environmental and operating conditions finally it may noted that significant physical phenomena induced by small shape modifications such as transitions separations etc may be overlooked as no physical information is processed by the method which justifies the fact that retaining a large geometric variance is not always associated to achieving better objective function values the inclusion of physics based information in the dimensionality reduction formulation has been presented and discussed in diez et al 2016b serani et al 2017a and serani and diez 2018b and is part of ongoing research furthermore linear methods such as kle pca may not be efficient when a complex non linear relationship between design variables is involved an extension to non linear dimensionality reduction methods and their effects on shape optimization have been discussed in d agostino et al 2018a b and d agostino et al 2018c the use of non linear methods with combined geometry and physics based data has been presented in d agostino et al 2019 and serani et al 2019 and is the subject of ongoing studies declaration of competing interest the authors declare

22176,this paper presents a parametric computer based technique to build a b spline model of a swath small waterplane area twin hull ship hull the method that is presented uses naval architecture parameters such as displacement waterplane area awp centre of buoyancy lcb and centre of flotation lcf to obtain a geometric definition of the hull that is not based on conic shapes cylinders cones or paraboloids as it is normally used in the literature but on chebychev polynomials and b spline curves and surfaces with the use of chebychev functions a given area centroid and even inertia can be imposed on a curve that is later modelled with a b spline curve in this way the swath struts can be designed with a given waterplane area lcf and inertia and then combined with a swath lower hull definition to obtain the ship s displacement and lcb the positions of lcb and lcf gain importance in the seakeeping behaviour of swath ships whilst the waterplane plays a role on their stability characteristics applying the method presented in this work all these variables can be controlled keywords parametric ship design swath chebychev functions constrained design 1 introduction the initial design procedure for a swath vessel is different from a monohull ship as there are different variables to be taken into account from the beginning in order to get a first estimate of ship s hull shape traditionally the design of a conventional monohull ship starts with the definition of its sectional area curve sac and its waterplane curve pérez arribas et al 2011 however this is not the case in a swath as its underwater geometry is composed of two different volumes the struts and the lower hulls therefore the sac is not as continuous as in the case of a monohull s which results in a more complex mathematical definition a third element above the water called the box can also be defined these three components are schematically depicted in fig 1 in the literature the lower hulls are normally divided along its length see e g bondarenko et al 2013 michalski 2007 papanikolaou et al 1990 1991 into three sections nose middle body and tail the nose and the tail are the forward and aft areas and they are traditionally defined by a conic section parabola or ellipse joined with a straight middle body once the longitudinal section is defined a revolution surface around its axis defines the final shape sometimes elliptical sections are used lamb 1988 macgregor et al 1989 regarding the struts they are normally defined in three segments in the same fashion as the lower hulls nose parallel middle body and tail and conic sections are also used for their nose and tail the strut shape marks the waterplane of the swath and the surfaces of the struts are defined by extruding the waterplane vertically a strut setback is defined as the separation between the tip s strut nose and the lower hull one two types of strut may be defined the short and overhanging ones fig 1 is the overhanging case the strut and the lower hull define one of the two hulls of the swath that are symmetric with respect to the centerline plane the box is placed over the struts and a transition of increasing breadth called haunch joins the struts to the box the hydrodynamic and hydrostatic stability characteristics of a swath are defined by the hulls while aspects related to cargo capacity and accommodation are controlled by the box volume in many designs it is difficult to use the space in the struts and haunch areas efficiently therefore a swath designed to carry a given payload will be larger than its monohull counterpart the interaction between the design of the underwater and the above water part of a swath is weaker than in the case of a conventional ship considering the aforementioned issues this paper presents a new parametric method for the design of the swath underwater hulls based on the usual hydrodynamic parameters thus obtaining a more advanced definition of the swath hulls in comparison to the traditional approach in which the hulls are defined with simple conic shapes this paper does not focus on swath optimization but rather on its parametric definition a parametric geometry is suitable for subsequent resistance or seakeeping optimization the methodology presented in this work facilitates the production of a further hydrodynamic or stability optimization of the swath that has been parametrically defined that will set optimum values for the parameters based on a merit criteria minimum power maximum initial transversal metacentric height gmt reduced accelerations which cannot be carried out with the traditional three conic shapes of the hull as it does not cover the lcb lcf or waterplane area the box structure can be also parametrically defined bondarenko et al 2013 but this has not been studied in this paper with the proposed methodology contoured hulls as the ones depicted in fig 2 may be obtained a priori without any hydrodynamic optimization procedure both hulls on this figure present the same displacement but are designed to operate at different speeds presenting a different hydrodynamic behaviour due to its different shape and centroids in order to impose the form parameters to the strut and lower hull this paper will use the properties of chebychev polynomials this paper is structured as follows firstly some brief comments about how a swath is designed are summarised in section 2 secondly a description about the effect of the design parameters in swath hydrodynamics will be done in section 3 after that how to impose certain geometric properties to a curve such as area and centroids with the use of chebychev series will be explained then in sections 4 1 4 2 and 5 it will be shown how to bring together the curves that define the lower hull and the strut into the definition of a swath hull with a given displacement lcb lcf and waterplane area together with some other swath parameters i e the strut setback from the lower hull tip or the strut depth at the aftermost part lastly some design examples and conclusions will be given this paper is focused on parametric swath design the novelties of this work when compared with the references that authors have found in the literature are that we present a method that uses common naval architecture parameters as constraints the method can define directly contoured hulls with b spline surfaces without further optimization techniques within the novelties the presented methodology enables the use of centroids lcb and lcf which relative position has an influence on seakeeping as it will be explained in section 3 it is also possible to include the inertia of the waterplane that affects seakeeping and stability therefore a new parametric methodology to build a b spline model for the preliminary design of swath ship hulls is presented in this paper 2 the preliminary design of swath vessels the different parts that compose a swath hull have the advantage that the geometry of each individual part strut and lower hull can to some degree be considered separately although they must then be carefully put together as their final selected dimensions are interactive with each other in achieving a balanced design swath offer remarkable seakeeping characteristics the struts provide hydrostatic stability as well as helping to reduce the resistance and wave exciting forces are reduced due to its low waterplane area swath configuration makes it possible for the designer to raise the periods of maximum pitch and heave responses significantly higher than for a larger monohull ship because these periods depend on waterplane area and longitudinal metacentric height gml as a result if a parametric method takes all these variables account into its definition it will be an optimal tool for the designer because it enables the control on the response of the vessel because of its reduced waterplane a swath is a poor candidate for the transport of heavy cargoes but an excellent choice for low density cargoes and operations that require good seakeeping parametric generation of swath ships can be used for the preliminary design of these kind of vessels that due to their superior seakeeping performance are used as pilot boats offshore wind farms support vessels passenger and patrol boats and pleasure yachts early works of swath design were linked to optimization techniques using linearised wave theory and the thin ship assumption satisfactory correlation between theory and experiments was obtained by a number of researchers in the field of swath resistance chapman 1972 lin 1976 employ a line source distribution to represent the wavemaking of the lower hulls despite the fact that this implies circular lower hulls these methods are widely used with elliptical forms using empirical correlation factors in kusaka et al 1980 authors focus on hydrodynamic optimization the lower hull is defined as an area curve a x of a revolution body and the strut is defined as a wall sided surface t x after the optimization procedure based on michell s source distribution for the strut and line doublet distribution for the lower hulls and the use of lagrange multipliers the geometry of the hull is obtained in salvensen et al 1985 the swath hull is generated with the use of a module called swathgen this module defines the geometry with the use of bi cubic hermite surface patches and the definition of the hull is made with the use of conic shapes an ellipse for the entrance of the lower body a parabola for the aftermost part and a straight area in the middle the software converts the initial geometry into a quad and triangle mesh that after the optimization may present a contoured shape without straight parts in papanikolaou 1990 1991 authors centre on optimization with the use of tangent search algorithm method in the first reference and of lagrange multipliers in the second one in order to minimise a wave resistance function and also consider economic factors the hull is initially modelled with conic shapes and transformed into a mesh that after the optimization may present a contoured shape in conclusion in the early works after a constrained optimization technique the final shape was obtained and the new shape and parameter values were calculated these early works used parametric models that were simplified allowing the generation of only specific hull forms but this did not limited the optimization approach with the use of a parametric model the most complete parametric model can be found in bondarenko et al 2013 where the authors propose a parametric model for swath that considers inputs such as the number of passengers endurance producing outputs such as weights estimations and an approximation for the ship s cost in this reference the hulls are modelled as a parabolic tail and nose for the lower hulls and struts another interesting design reference is pal 2006 where the author focuses on a model with economical inputs instead of geometric dimensions to define a passenger swath ship as in the previous reference the hull design is simplified to conic shapes in beena et al 2003 authors start optimization techniques with an initial guess for the swath geometry impose certain constraints that are maintained in the different solutions and alter the control points of the initial surface to produce the family of hulls studied during the optimization in brizzolara 2004 the author only optimizes the lower hull of a multi strut swath the lower hull is defined as a revolution surface of a 7 control point b spline curve the position of these control points is the input for the optimization techniques and the lower hull volume is maintained under a certain tolerance the same swath definition is used in vernengo and brizzolara 2017 considering inclined struts with respect to the center plane interest in swath design is indicated in recent references in lin et al 2019 authors use an automatic design optimization procedure for swath based on cfd analysis geometrical modification and an optimization algorithm with regards to the swath geometry they use a parametric model dividing the problem into two parts the strut definition and the underwater hulls definition the underwater hulls are defined based on a sixth order polynomial and the surface of the strut is assumed vertically extruded with a parabolic section begovic et al 2019 tested 4 different swath configurations experimentally in this reference authors refer to the logic behind strut design to analyse resistance and seakeeping improvements the use of b spline curves and surfaces is the current design standard in ship design however the direct constrained design of these curves to maintain an enclosed area i e a waterplane curve and the constraint of its centroid is a difficult task pérez arribas 2011 demanding the use of non linear systems and the addition of other geometric constraints such as angles at the ends of the curve this complex set of equations can be substituted by the use of chebychev series in which it is relatively easy to impose a given enclosed area and its area moments and once the curve points have been computed an interpolating b spline curve produces the final solution that can be easily revolved for the lower hull or vertically extruded in the case of the strut realistic hull shape areas can be obtained with this technique the review of the available methods in the literature concludes that none of them includes centroids into its definition and the use of displacement or waterplane is made by iteration over some parameters the present methodology allows the use of all these hydrodynamic parameters directly as explained in the following sections 3 effect of design parameters on resistance and seakeeping parametric design allows for a relatively easy optimization of resistance and seakeeping properties in this section the effect of some parameters directly linked to this optimization will be introduced even though this optimization is not considered in the present paper regarding resistance optimization a swath has a higher wetted surface area which contributes inevitably to penalties in the frictional resistance at lower speeds however wavemaking resistance can be optimized by controlling the interference between the struts and lower hulls setback and centroids separation chun 1988 in this reference an important reduction over this part of the resistance was obtained with the variation in shape contoured hulls and dimensions of different examples of swath hulls from experiments in lamb 1975 it has been shown that wavemaking resistance presents strong peaks at froude numbers fn 0 3 and fn 0 5 mainly due to the wave interaction between hulls consequently design speeds are normally selected in the troughs of these wavemaking resistance curves which happen around fn 0 2 0 38 and 0 65 these values would enable an estimation of the waterline length that sets the strut length the shape of the residuary resistance is depicted in fig 3 where curves for different swaths with different lower hulls maximum diameters are illustrated a higher l d value in this figure indicates a more slender lower hull in x axis of this figure froude number can be computed as f n 0 30 v k l o a 1 2 with loa the overall length of the swath for low fn values an overhanging strut with a strut length greater than the lower hull one is desirable as it will produce a more slender waterplane for an enclosed area regarding the hull shape it is often worthwhile to arrange the submerged geometry in such a way that both the magnitude and location of the mentioned resistance peaks are altered a contoured hull form offers the advantage of resistance optimization at the expense of increased constructional difficulty non circular lower hulls are popular in swath design because of their improved added mass and motion damping characteristics mcgregor 1989 studies how at high fn values contoured hulls with bulges at the ends produce significant savings in resistance while at low speeds a shape with midship bulges presents a lower resistance besides reducing resistance at high speeds contoured hulls may fit machinery better than conventional shapes at lower hull as a result better performance would be expected from hulls designed with more attention to detail rather than from the traditional use of cylinders and paraboloids in the hull definition it is also important to integrate swath hulls and machinery design at an early stage and ensure that potential conflicts are avoided the previous issues can be studied with the use of a parametric hull definition regarding seakeeping heave is the most severe motion for a swath rao response amplitude operator functions of this motion can reach a maximum value over 2 meaning that the vertical oscillation will be over twice the wave amplitude in the resonance peak period lamb 1988 if the ship is excited in this zone the small waterplane area results in a low restoring moment and the hull shape produces little damping fortunately a small waterplane area of a swath assures a large heave modal period and if well designed for a given sea state the ship can operate safely in high seas while the encounter waves periods are below the resonance one the heave period of a surface ship can be estimated using the equation shown below 1 t h e a v e 2 π 1 a 33 g a w p where is the displacement volume a 33 is the heave added mass divided by the ship volume which in the case of a swath can be estimated as 0 70 for circular sections g is gravity value and awp is the waterplane area by selecting the right values for these parameters included in the present method the designer can project a swath that navigates over the dominant wave period of a given sea state notice that the period should be the encounter period that includes the ship speed effect the effect of reducing awp to increase the heave period can be seen in fig 4 the three hulls displayed have the same displacement taking the hull at the top as a reference the middle one has 10 of awp meaning heave period increases 5 4 according to 1 and the bottom hull has 20 of awp increasing heave period 11 8 notice how the lower volume in the struts as awp decreases is compensated by the increased volume of the lower hulls so the displacement is maintained elliptical sections for the lower hulls can increase the value of a 33 producing a swath that has a greater resonance period than the circular ones elliptical hulls with an aspect ratio between the horizontal and vertical axis can increase the a 33 from 0 70 up to 0 90 value lamb 1988 in fig 5 two swath hulls with the same displacement are shown the only difference is that the sections on the lower hull are circular on the left and elliptical on the right elliptical sections increase the breadth of lower hull and with less draft when compared with the circular one analogously to heave pitch modal period can be estimated as 2 t p i t c h 2 π l s 2 k p 2 a 55 2 g g m l where ls is the strut length gml is the longitudinal metacentric height kp is the pitch gyradius divided by ship ls and a 55 is the hydrodynamic pitch added inertia divided by the ship mass for a swath ship a 55 is estimated as 0 244 lamb 1988 another aspect related with seakeeping is the separation between the lcf and lcb the exciting wave force exerted on ship tends to be centered near the centroid of the waterplane lcf on the other hand ship s weight is centered in the ship s center of gravity which will act vertically through the buoyancy center whose longitudinal position is lcb therefore if there is a large separation between lcf and lcb the wave buoyant forces will result in an important pitch moment small waterplane area also produces a little inertia and hence a small pitch restoring moment to counteract wave exciting forces this problem can be avoided by choosing the swath geometry with a minimal lcb and lcf separation in fig 6 three swath hulls of equal displacement awp and lcf are shown while moving lcb foreward at the same distance and aft the position of lcf the rest of the parameters are maintained notice how volume is shifted aft in the lower hulls because awp is maintained in conclusion it can be derived that rather than being somehow intrinsic to the swath concept excellent seakeeping performance is the result of a careful approach to the swath hull form design and by considering all these design parameters into its definition the proposed methodology can be an optimal tool for a successful swath design 4 constrained generation of curves there are several ways to define a curve that encloses a given area within the x axis and also has a given centroid a designer could apply such methods to define the sac or waterplane of a ship and include important hydrostatic parameters into its definition values that have an influence on hydrodynamics and stability an application of these techniques applied to ship preliminary design was done in lackenby 1950 but requires a parent ship and can result in an unfaired hull in this paper a chebychev series abramowitz and stegun 1965 is used to simplify the problem considerably a chebychev expression takes the form 3 p x n 1 n a p n cos 2 n 1 α b p n s i n 2 n α where α arcsin x and x is a non dimensional variable that lies in the range 1 1 in order to transform from this interval into a given length a change of variable is necessary which in this case would be y l 2 x with l being the length of the curve along the x axis i e strut or lowe hull length the coordinate origin in the previous equation is located in the mid point of l the value of α is selected so the curve presents null values at its ends which is desirable for the definition of the strut and lower hull equation 3 gives p 0 1 so it can be considered a non dimensional curve and dimensions for its ordinates can be produced just by multiplying p x by the value area or strut thickness at the mid point of l directly from the expression of the curve in equation 3 conditions that must be satisfied can be imposed and so the value of a pn and b pn deducted the area under the curve and one or more moments can be imposed in order to obtain curves with different properties two of these cases will be covered here first a simple example involving the area and the first order moment related with centroid lcb or lcf and then another one in which the second order moment related with inertia and hence with gml is included finally both curves will be compared 4 1 curves that enclose a given area and a first moment of area the simplest constraints that can be imposed on a curve are the area under the curve and its first moment of area the expressions can be obtained by simply integrating the curve constructed in 3 as it is shown in the expressions below for the area 4 a l 2 l 2 p y d y 1 1 p x l 2 p x d x 1 1 p x d x 2 a l p x where p x is the value of the curve at p 0 similarly the first moment of area can be integrated resulting 5 m l 2 l 2 y p y d y 1 1 p x l 2 2 x p x d x 1 1 x p x d x 4 m l 2 p x once the expressions are presented equations 4 and 5 must be solved in order to do that values inside the integral will be substituted by the chebychev series in equation 3 which results in 6 p x a p 1 cos α a p 2 cos 3 α b p 1 sin 2 α b p 2 sin 4 α substituting on equation 4 7 1 1 p x d x a p 1 π 2 π 2 cos 2 α d α a p 2 π 2 π 2 cos α cos 3 α d α b p 1 π 2 π 2 cos α sin 2 α d α b p 2 π 2 π 2 cos α sin 4 α d α 2 a l p x each of the integrals above are now solved resulting in all the integrals being null except the first one a p 1 hence giving a result for equation 7 8 a p 1 π 2 2 a l p x a p 1 4 a π l p x likewise an expression can be obtained for equation 7 9 1 1 x p x d x a p 1 π 2 π 2 sin α cos 2 α d α a p 2 π 2 π 2 sin α cos α cos 3 α d α b p 1 π 2 π 2 sin α cos α sin 2 α d α b p 2 π 2 π 2 sin α cos α sin 4 α d α 4 m l 2 p x in which the only term that it is not zero is the one corresponding to b p 1 solving equation 9 10 b p 1 π 4 4 m l 2 p x b p 1 16 m π l 2 p x the last condition is obtained from 6 by forcing the curve to be 0 value at the ends 11 a p 1 a p 2 1 to sum up the coefficients that define equation 6 are 12 a p 1 4 a π l p x a p 2 1 a p 1 b p 1 16 m π l 2 p x b p 2 0 the first moment m is related with the position of the centroid of the curve as m centroid a fig 7 shows different curves constructed with the presented methodology that enclose the same area for the same length but considering different positions for the centroid and p x as an application to swath design these curves could be applied to a strut section in order to impose a waterplane area strut length l lcf and strut thickness at the midpoint of l the application of these curves for the lower hull shape is straightforward the area is the displacement of the lower hull the centroid is the centroid of the volume l is the lower hull length and p x the area at the midpoint of l every point of the curve represents the area value and if circular sections are used the radius of every section can be easily computed as the squared root of the area divided by π elliptical sections with a constant relation between their major to minor axis are also easy to obtain examples of lower hulls with constant displacement and length are presented in fig 8 with the formulation contoured hulls with bumps at the ends or in the middle can be defined just by considering the adequate values for the input parameters 4 2 a more general expression for the curves as reported in the previous section it is relatively easy to add more moments of area to the current formulation as it only implies solving a higher order integral expressed as a series of sines and cosines therefore a second moment of area or inertia will be added to the previous calculated expressions resulting in 13 i l 2 l 2 y 2 p y d y 1 1 p x l 2 3 x 2 p x d x 1 1 x 2 p x d x 8 i l 3 p x equations 4 5 and 13 set the new system that needs to be solved expression for p x now takes the form 14 p x a p 1 cos α a p 2 cos 3 α a p 3 cos 5 α b p 1 sin 2 α b p 2 sin 4 α b p 3 cos 6 α where as in the previous section the expression is to be integrated to obtain the area and moments of area this time the process has to be repeated three times the two first expressions have been derived on the previous section for m 2 and the result is independent of m therefore expressions 8 and 10 are identical in this case thus it is necessary to derive the third condition which is obtained from integrating expression 14 for a second moment of area which results in 15 1 1 x 2 p x d x a p 1 π 2 π 2 sin 2 α cos 2 α d α a p 2 π 2 π 2 sin 2 α cos α cos 3 α d α a p 3 π 2 π 2 sin 2 α cos α cos 5 α d α b p 1 π 2 π 2 sin 2 α cos α sin 2 α d α b p 2 π 2 π 2 sin 2 α cos α sin 4 α d α b p 3 π 2 π 2 sin 2 α cos α sin 6 α d α 8 i l 3 p x and obtaining each of the integrals separately the only terms that contribute are the first and the second so 16 a p 1 a p 2 π 4 8 i l 3 p x the final condition is given by forcing the curve to be 0 at its ends 17 a p 1 a p 2 a p 3 1 to sum up the coefficients to be imposed on the curve of equation 14 are 18 a p 1 4 a l π p x a p 2 a p 1 32 i l 3 π p x a p 3 1 a p 1 a p 2 b p 1 16 m l 2 π p x b p 2 0 b p 3 0 these coefficients are equivalent to the ones in 12 but enable the use of the curve s second moment of areas or inertia i with respect to the origin or the midpoint the use of the inertia alters mainly the shape of the curve at its ends so if inertia is reduced its ends will be thinner and vice versa fig 9 and fig 10 show the effect of including i into the curve s definition the curve in the middle does not include the inertia while the one on the top does it shapes are compared at the bottom of the figure with the shaded one being the curve with a modified inertia inertia has to be managed carefully to get realistic shapes otherwise unpractical curves may be obtained it is suggested to start with the original inertia of the curve which does not include the second area moment calculated as in section 4 1 and tune the inertia value starting from there examples of unrealistic shapes are illustrated in fig 11 starting with the same parameters as in fig 10 5 parametric design of swath hulls curves in the previous sections from equations 6 and 14 have been defined in terms of general parameters of area and moments however these can be related to the hydrodynamic parameters of a swath ship see table 1 establishing a methodology that allows to determine the hull and strut shapes in terms of the global parameters of the ship as will be detailed in this section some simplifications have to be assumed in order to relate global parameters with the geometric ones that define the curves as it has been described in the previous sections main parameters of a swath hull can be seen in fig 12 since awp waterplane area of one strut ts and ls are inputs the struts can be obtained first with eq 6 just considering the first area moment as a function of lcf with 19 l c f l s 2 x s m w p a w p m w p a w p l s 2 x s l c f notice that lcf is a positive magnitude and it is referred to the leading edge of the lower hull with the first moment mwp and the rest of inputs the constants of 6 can be obtained with the use of eq 12 so the strut section can be defined by extruding this section a magnitude t 1 the 3d strut is defined an intermediate strut that connects the upper strut with the lower body can be easily defined considering the points of the strut with an abscissa l i l s the extrusion distance of this intermediate strut will be t s t 1 fig 12 the displacement in terms of volume of one of the hulls can be expressed as the sum of the lower body displacement and the strut or struts if an intermediate strut is defined displacement according to the following expression 20 h i s s h i s a w p t 1 h 1 k a w p t 1 h 1 k a w p t 1 where the subscripts h is and s correspond to the lower hull intermediate strut and upper strut respectively awp is the waterplane area and ts the draught of the strut the volume of the intermediate strut is expressed here in terms of the upper strut and a coefficient accounting for the percentage of volume given to the intermediate strut as it can be seen in the case that the intermediate strut is not defined k 0 and the volume corresponds entirely to the upper strut i e in a short strut swath where l s l h there exists a similar relation to eq 19 to relate the first moment of area of the whole swath hull called m h with the hydrostatic coefficients of the ship this expression for the swath hull considered takes the form 21 l c b h l c b h s l c f x s l c b h l c b a w p t 1 l c f x s a w p t 1 m h h l h 2 l c b h notice that lcb and lcbh are referenced to the lower hull leading edge and that they are positive magnitudes considering the values of the lower hull displacement in eq 20 the first moment of area in eq 21 lb and also sx the area distribution of the lower hull can be obtained with eqs 6 and 12 with this area distribution the radius of every section of the lower hull can be easily obtained as explained in section 4 1 once the geometry of the strut and lower hull is obtained the leading and trailing edges of these bodies can be tuned up only considering the second moment of area as it was explained in section 4 2 as suggested in that section the second moment of area can produce unrealistic results fig 11 so it is better to change this value carefully considering as a reference the value of the curves that do not include the inertia into its definition 6 examples in order to test the applicability of the method the hulls of two different swath ships have been defined with the presented method maintaining most of the parameters for both ships but altering the shape of the lower hull between each other additionally the shape of the lower hull is computed in the first example without considering the inertia section 4 1 and considering it section 4 2 so the effect on the shape of this parameter is clearly shown the first example see table 2 and fig 13 corresponds to a conventional swath ship without bumps at its ends so it is defined to operate at low fn numbers 0 3 according to section 3 the parameters that define this ship appear on table 1 in this ship the lower hull is computed following section 4 1 so the inertia is not included into its definition the second example see table 2 and fig 14 is a modification of the previous one but in this case the area at the midpoint of the lower hull sx has been reduced since the displacement and lcb are maintained volume in the lower hull is shifted to the ends producing bulges and hence a swath hull designed to operate at a higher fn than in the previous example see fig 13 the volume at the ends of the lower hulls in example 2 was modified by reducing the inertia according to expressions in section 4 2 the original curve in red in fig 15 was calculated according expressions of section 4 1 and the final design coloured in blue reduces the inertia by a 9 5 in order to get finer ends in the lower hulls but keeping the enclosed volume circular sections have been used see fig 14 parameter k controlling the intermediate strut displacement value has been selected so the lower hulls of the two ships present the same displacement 7 conclusions in this work a new parametric methodology to build a b spline model for the preliminary design of swath ship hulls has been presented this methodology enables the definition of contoured hull shapes that overcome the traditional swath underwater hull definition with conic shapes contoured hulls have a better behaviour for high speed swath ships the method is based on the use of chebychev polynomials to define areas and moments of area that are subsequently linked to naval architecture parameters such as displacement lcb waterplane area and lcf defined in table 1 the relation of these hydrodynamic coefficients with hydrodynamics and stability characteristics is reviewed although the behaviour of the resulting hulls into these fields is not the objective in this work chebychev polynomials allow to define the underwater bodies that define a swath hull in a simple manner without solving non linear systems of equations therefore two sets of expressions are enough to define the strut or lower hulls shapes more equations can be added into the definition of the hull for example in this work a three equation model is described that includes the inertia as a design parameter to control the leading and trailing edges slenderness the curves obtained are easily extended to 3d by an extrusion struts and a revolution surface lower hulls circular sections for the lower hull can be easily converted into elliptical ones maintaining the enclosed area the position of the centroids lcf and lcb become the key aspect in order to get different shapes that makes further hull optimization of resistance and seakeeping characteristics possible this aspect has not been considered in previous parametric definitions of swath hulls since this work is focused on parametric definition of a swath geometry different swath examples are presented and the influence of the variation of different design parameters over the final shape is shown stating clearly that it is relatively simple to generate many different hulls future work may include optimization of swath hulls considering the parametric modelization that has been defined considering resistance seakeeping or stability characteristics according to a relevant merit criteria further geometric work may complete our presented hull definition including the box and decks following references papanikolau et al 1990 1991 or bondarenko et al 2013 these way aspects related with transport variables number of passengers deck area or

22176,this paper presents a parametric computer based technique to build a b spline model of a swath small waterplane area twin hull ship hull the method that is presented uses naval architecture parameters such as displacement waterplane area awp centre of buoyancy lcb and centre of flotation lcf to obtain a geometric definition of the hull that is not based on conic shapes cylinders cones or paraboloids as it is normally used in the literature but on chebychev polynomials and b spline curves and surfaces with the use of chebychev functions a given area centroid and even inertia can be imposed on a curve that is later modelled with a b spline curve in this way the swath struts can be designed with a given waterplane area lcf and inertia and then combined with a swath lower hull definition to obtain the ship s displacement and lcb the positions of lcb and lcf gain importance in the seakeeping behaviour of swath ships whilst the waterplane plays a role on their stability characteristics applying the method presented in this work all these variables can be controlled keywords parametric ship design swath chebychev functions constrained design 1 introduction the initial design procedure for a swath vessel is different from a monohull ship as there are different variables to be taken into account from the beginning in order to get a first estimate of ship s hull shape traditionally the design of a conventional monohull ship starts with the definition of its sectional area curve sac and its waterplane curve pérez arribas et al 2011 however this is not the case in a swath as its underwater geometry is composed of two different volumes the struts and the lower hulls therefore the sac is not as continuous as in the case of a monohull s which results in a more complex mathematical definition a third element above the water called the box can also be defined these three components are schematically depicted in fig 1 in the literature the lower hulls are normally divided along its length see e g bondarenko et al 2013 michalski 2007 papanikolaou et al 1990 1991 into three sections nose middle body and tail the nose and the tail are the forward and aft areas and they are traditionally defined by a conic section parabola or ellipse joined with a straight middle body once the longitudinal section is defined a revolution surface around its axis defines the final shape sometimes elliptical sections are used lamb 1988 macgregor et al 1989 regarding the struts they are normally defined in three segments in the same fashion as the lower hulls nose parallel middle body and tail and conic sections are also used for their nose and tail the strut shape marks the waterplane of the swath and the surfaces of the struts are defined by extruding the waterplane vertically a strut setback is defined as the separation between the tip s strut nose and the lower hull one two types of strut may be defined the short and overhanging ones fig 1 is the overhanging case the strut and the lower hull define one of the two hulls of the swath that are symmetric with respect to the centerline plane the box is placed over the struts and a transition of increasing breadth called haunch joins the struts to the box the hydrodynamic and hydrostatic stability characteristics of a swath are defined by the hulls while aspects related to cargo capacity and accommodation are controlled by the box volume in many designs it is difficult to use the space in the struts and haunch areas efficiently therefore a swath designed to carry a given payload will be larger than its monohull counterpart the interaction between the design of the underwater and the above water part of a swath is weaker than in the case of a conventional ship considering the aforementioned issues this paper presents a new parametric method for the design of the swath underwater hulls based on the usual hydrodynamic parameters thus obtaining a more advanced definition of the swath hulls in comparison to the traditional approach in which the hulls are defined with simple conic shapes this paper does not focus on swath optimization but rather on its parametric definition a parametric geometry is suitable for subsequent resistance or seakeeping optimization the methodology presented in this work facilitates the production of a further hydrodynamic or stability optimization of the swath that has been parametrically defined that will set optimum values for the parameters based on a merit criteria minimum power maximum initial transversal metacentric height gmt reduced accelerations which cannot be carried out with the traditional three conic shapes of the hull as it does not cover the lcb lcf or waterplane area the box structure can be also parametrically defined bondarenko et al 2013 but this has not been studied in this paper with the proposed methodology contoured hulls as the ones depicted in fig 2 may be obtained a priori without any hydrodynamic optimization procedure both hulls on this figure present the same displacement but are designed to operate at different speeds presenting a different hydrodynamic behaviour due to its different shape and centroids in order to impose the form parameters to the strut and lower hull this paper will use the properties of chebychev polynomials this paper is structured as follows firstly some brief comments about how a swath is designed are summarised in section 2 secondly a description about the effect of the design parameters in swath hydrodynamics will be done in section 3 after that how to impose certain geometric properties to a curve such as area and centroids with the use of chebychev series will be explained then in sections 4 1 4 2 and 5 it will be shown how to bring together the curves that define the lower hull and the strut into the definition of a swath hull with a given displacement lcb lcf and waterplane area together with some other swath parameters i e the strut setback from the lower hull tip or the strut depth at the aftermost part lastly some design examples and conclusions will be given this paper is focused on parametric swath design the novelties of this work when compared with the references that authors have found in the literature are that we present a method that uses common naval architecture parameters as constraints the method can define directly contoured hulls with b spline surfaces without further optimization techniques within the novelties the presented methodology enables the use of centroids lcb and lcf which relative position has an influence on seakeeping as it will be explained in section 3 it is also possible to include the inertia of the waterplane that affects seakeeping and stability therefore a new parametric methodology to build a b spline model for the preliminary design of swath ship hulls is presented in this paper 2 the preliminary design of swath vessels the different parts that compose a swath hull have the advantage that the geometry of each individual part strut and lower hull can to some degree be considered separately although they must then be carefully put together as their final selected dimensions are interactive with each other in achieving a balanced design swath offer remarkable seakeeping characteristics the struts provide hydrostatic stability as well as helping to reduce the resistance and wave exciting forces are reduced due to its low waterplane area swath configuration makes it possible for the designer to raise the periods of maximum pitch and heave responses significantly higher than for a larger monohull ship because these periods depend on waterplane area and longitudinal metacentric height gml as a result if a parametric method takes all these variables account into its definition it will be an optimal tool for the designer because it enables the control on the response of the vessel because of its reduced waterplane a swath is a poor candidate for the transport of heavy cargoes but an excellent choice for low density cargoes and operations that require good seakeeping parametric generation of swath ships can be used for the preliminary design of these kind of vessels that due to their superior seakeeping performance are used as pilot boats offshore wind farms support vessels passenger and patrol boats and pleasure yachts early works of swath design were linked to optimization techniques using linearised wave theory and the thin ship assumption satisfactory correlation between theory and experiments was obtained by a number of researchers in the field of swath resistance chapman 1972 lin 1976 employ a line source distribution to represent the wavemaking of the lower hulls despite the fact that this implies circular lower hulls these methods are widely used with elliptical forms using empirical correlation factors in kusaka et al 1980 authors focus on hydrodynamic optimization the lower hull is defined as an area curve a x of a revolution body and the strut is defined as a wall sided surface t x after the optimization procedure based on michell s source distribution for the strut and line doublet distribution for the lower hulls and the use of lagrange multipliers the geometry of the hull is obtained in salvensen et al 1985 the swath hull is generated with the use of a module called swathgen this module defines the geometry with the use of bi cubic hermite surface patches and the definition of the hull is made with the use of conic shapes an ellipse for the entrance of the lower body a parabola for the aftermost part and a straight area in the middle the software converts the initial geometry into a quad and triangle mesh that after the optimization may present a contoured shape without straight parts in papanikolaou 1990 1991 authors centre on optimization with the use of tangent search algorithm method in the first reference and of lagrange multipliers in the second one in order to minimise a wave resistance function and also consider economic factors the hull is initially modelled with conic shapes and transformed into a mesh that after the optimization may present a contoured shape in conclusion in the early works after a constrained optimization technique the final shape was obtained and the new shape and parameter values were calculated these early works used parametric models that were simplified allowing the generation of only specific hull forms but this did not limited the optimization approach with the use of a parametric model the most complete parametric model can be found in bondarenko et al 2013 where the authors propose a parametric model for swath that considers inputs such as the number of passengers endurance producing outputs such as weights estimations and an approximation for the ship s cost in this reference the hulls are modelled as a parabolic tail and nose for the lower hulls and struts another interesting design reference is pal 2006 where the author focuses on a model with economical inputs instead of geometric dimensions to define a passenger swath ship as in the previous reference the hull design is simplified to conic shapes in beena et al 2003 authors start optimization techniques with an initial guess for the swath geometry impose certain constraints that are maintained in the different solutions and alter the control points of the initial surface to produce the family of hulls studied during the optimization in brizzolara 2004 the author only optimizes the lower hull of a multi strut swath the lower hull is defined as a revolution surface of a 7 control point b spline curve the position of these control points is the input for the optimization techniques and the lower hull volume is maintained under a certain tolerance the same swath definition is used in vernengo and brizzolara 2017 considering inclined struts with respect to the center plane interest in swath design is indicated in recent references in lin et al 2019 authors use an automatic design optimization procedure for swath based on cfd analysis geometrical modification and an optimization algorithm with regards to the swath geometry they use a parametric model dividing the problem into two parts the strut definition and the underwater hulls definition the underwater hulls are defined based on a sixth order polynomial and the surface of the strut is assumed vertically extruded with a parabolic section begovic et al 2019 tested 4 different swath configurations experimentally in this reference authors refer to the logic behind strut design to analyse resistance and seakeeping improvements the use of b spline curves and surfaces is the current design standard in ship design however the direct constrained design of these curves to maintain an enclosed area i e a waterplane curve and the constraint of its centroid is a difficult task pérez arribas 2011 demanding the use of non linear systems and the addition of other geometric constraints such as angles at the ends of the curve this complex set of equations can be substituted by the use of chebychev series in which it is relatively easy to impose a given enclosed area and its area moments and once the curve points have been computed an interpolating b spline curve produces the final solution that can be easily revolved for the lower hull or vertically extruded in the case of the strut realistic hull shape areas can be obtained with this technique the review of the available methods in the literature concludes that none of them includes centroids into its definition and the use of displacement or waterplane is made by iteration over some parameters the present methodology allows the use of all these hydrodynamic parameters directly as explained in the following sections 3 effect of design parameters on resistance and seakeeping parametric design allows for a relatively easy optimization of resistance and seakeeping properties in this section the effect of some parameters directly linked to this optimization will be introduced even though this optimization is not considered in the present paper regarding resistance optimization a swath has a higher wetted surface area which contributes inevitably to penalties in the frictional resistance at lower speeds however wavemaking resistance can be optimized by controlling the interference between the struts and lower hulls setback and centroids separation chun 1988 in this reference an important reduction over this part of the resistance was obtained with the variation in shape contoured hulls and dimensions of different examples of swath hulls from experiments in lamb 1975 it has been shown that wavemaking resistance presents strong peaks at froude numbers fn 0 3 and fn 0 5 mainly due to the wave interaction between hulls consequently design speeds are normally selected in the troughs of these wavemaking resistance curves which happen around fn 0 2 0 38 and 0 65 these values would enable an estimation of the waterline length that sets the strut length the shape of the residuary resistance is depicted in fig 3 where curves for different swaths with different lower hulls maximum diameters are illustrated a higher l d value in this figure indicates a more slender lower hull in x axis of this figure froude number can be computed as f n 0 30 v k l o a 1 2 with loa the overall length of the swath for low fn values an overhanging strut with a strut length greater than the lower hull one is desirable as it will produce a more slender waterplane for an enclosed area regarding the hull shape it is often worthwhile to arrange the submerged geometry in such a way that both the magnitude and location of the mentioned resistance peaks are altered a contoured hull form offers the advantage of resistance optimization at the expense of increased constructional difficulty non circular lower hulls are popular in swath design because of their improved added mass and motion damping characteristics mcgregor 1989 studies how at high fn values contoured hulls with bulges at the ends produce significant savings in resistance while at low speeds a shape with midship bulges presents a lower resistance besides reducing resistance at high speeds contoured hulls may fit machinery better than conventional shapes at lower hull as a result better performance would be expected from hulls designed with more attention to detail rather than from the traditional use of cylinders and paraboloids in the hull definition it is also important to integrate swath hulls and machinery design at an early stage and ensure that potential conflicts are avoided the previous issues can be studied with the use of a parametric hull definition regarding seakeeping heave is the most severe motion for a swath rao response amplitude operator functions of this motion can reach a maximum value over 2 meaning that the vertical oscillation will be over twice the wave amplitude in the resonance peak period lamb 1988 if the ship is excited in this zone the small waterplane area results in a low restoring moment and the hull shape produces little damping fortunately a small waterplane area of a swath assures a large heave modal period and if well designed for a given sea state the ship can operate safely in high seas while the encounter waves periods are below the resonance one the heave period of a surface ship can be estimated using the equation shown below 1 t h e a v e 2 π 1 a 33 g a w p where is the displacement volume a 33 is the heave added mass divided by the ship volume which in the case of a swath can be estimated as 0 70 for circular sections g is gravity value and awp is the waterplane area by selecting the right values for these parameters included in the present method the designer can project a swath that navigates over the dominant wave period of a given sea state notice that the period should be the encounter period that includes the ship speed effect the effect of reducing awp to increase the heave period can be seen in fig 4 the three hulls displayed have the same displacement taking the hull at the top as a reference the middle one has 10 of awp meaning heave period increases 5 4 according to 1 and the bottom hull has 20 of awp increasing heave period 11 8 notice how the lower volume in the struts as awp decreases is compensated by the increased volume of the lower hulls so the displacement is maintained elliptical sections for the lower hulls can increase the value of a 33 producing a swath that has a greater resonance period than the circular ones elliptical hulls with an aspect ratio between the horizontal and vertical axis can increase the a 33 from 0 70 up to 0 90 value lamb 1988 in fig 5 two swath hulls with the same displacement are shown the only difference is that the sections on the lower hull are circular on the left and elliptical on the right elliptical sections increase the breadth of lower hull and with less draft when compared with the circular one analogously to heave pitch modal period can be estimated as 2 t p i t c h 2 π l s 2 k p 2 a 55 2 g g m l where ls is the strut length gml is the longitudinal metacentric height kp is the pitch gyradius divided by ship ls and a 55 is the hydrodynamic pitch added inertia divided by the ship mass for a swath ship a 55 is estimated as 0 244 lamb 1988 another aspect related with seakeeping is the separation between the lcf and lcb the exciting wave force exerted on ship tends to be centered near the centroid of the waterplane lcf on the other hand ship s weight is centered in the ship s center of gravity which will act vertically through the buoyancy center whose longitudinal position is lcb therefore if there is a large separation between lcf and lcb the wave buoyant forces will result in an important pitch moment small waterplane area also produces a little inertia and hence a small pitch restoring moment to counteract wave exciting forces this problem can be avoided by choosing the swath geometry with a minimal lcb and lcf separation in fig 6 three swath hulls of equal displacement awp and lcf are shown while moving lcb foreward at the same distance and aft the position of lcf the rest of the parameters are maintained notice how volume is shifted aft in the lower hulls because awp is maintained in conclusion it can be derived that rather than being somehow intrinsic to the swath concept excellent seakeeping performance is the result of a careful approach to the swath hull form design and by considering all these design parameters into its definition the proposed methodology can be an optimal tool for a successful swath design 4 constrained generation of curves there are several ways to define a curve that encloses a given area within the x axis and also has a given centroid a designer could apply such methods to define the sac or waterplane of a ship and include important hydrostatic parameters into its definition values that have an influence on hydrodynamics and stability an application of these techniques applied to ship preliminary design was done in lackenby 1950 but requires a parent ship and can result in an unfaired hull in this paper a chebychev series abramowitz and stegun 1965 is used to simplify the problem considerably a chebychev expression takes the form 3 p x n 1 n a p n cos 2 n 1 α b p n s i n 2 n α where α arcsin x and x is a non dimensional variable that lies in the range 1 1 in order to transform from this interval into a given length a change of variable is necessary which in this case would be y l 2 x with l being the length of the curve along the x axis i e strut or lowe hull length the coordinate origin in the previous equation is located in the mid point of l the value of α is selected so the curve presents null values at its ends which is desirable for the definition of the strut and lower hull equation 3 gives p 0 1 so it can be considered a non dimensional curve and dimensions for its ordinates can be produced just by multiplying p x by the value area or strut thickness at the mid point of l directly from the expression of the curve in equation 3 conditions that must be satisfied can be imposed and so the value of a pn and b pn deducted the area under the curve and one or more moments can be imposed in order to obtain curves with different properties two of these cases will be covered here first a simple example involving the area and the first order moment related with centroid lcb or lcf and then another one in which the second order moment related with inertia and hence with gml is included finally both curves will be compared 4 1 curves that enclose a given area and a first moment of area the simplest constraints that can be imposed on a curve are the area under the curve and its first moment of area the expressions can be obtained by simply integrating the curve constructed in 3 as it is shown in the expressions below for the area 4 a l 2 l 2 p y d y 1 1 p x l 2 p x d x 1 1 p x d x 2 a l p x where p x is the value of the curve at p 0 similarly the first moment of area can be integrated resulting 5 m l 2 l 2 y p y d y 1 1 p x l 2 2 x p x d x 1 1 x p x d x 4 m l 2 p x once the expressions are presented equations 4 and 5 must be solved in order to do that values inside the integral will be substituted by the chebychev series in equation 3 which results in 6 p x a p 1 cos α a p 2 cos 3 α b p 1 sin 2 α b p 2 sin 4 α substituting on equation 4 7 1 1 p x d x a p 1 π 2 π 2

null except the first one a p 1 hence giving a result for equation 7 8 a p 1 π 2 2 a l p x a p 1 4 a π l p x likewise an expression can be obtained for equation 7 9 1 1 x p x d x a p 1 π 2 π 2 sin α cos 2 α d α a p 2 π 2 π 2 sin α cos α cos 3 α d α b p 1 π 2 π 2 sin α cos α sin 2 α d α b p 2 π 2 π 2 sin α cos α sin 4 α d α 4 m l 2 p x in which the only term that it is not zero is the one corresponding to b p 1 solving equation 9 10 b p 1 π 4 4 m l 2 p x b p 1 16 m π l 2 p x the last condition is obtained from 6 by forcing the curve to be 0 value at the ends 11 a p 1 a p 2 1 to sum up the coefficients that define equation 6 are 12 a p 1 4 a π l p x a p 2 1 a p 1 b p 1 16 m π l 2 p x b p 2 0 the first moment m is related with the position of the centroid of the curve as m centroid a fig 7 shows different curves constructed with the presented methodology that enclose the same area for the same length but considering different positions for the centroid and p x as an application to swath design these curves could be applied to a strut section in order to impose a waterplane area strut length l lcf and strut thickness at the midpoint of l the application of these curves for the lower hull shape is straightforward the area is the displacement of the lower hull the centroid is the centroid of the volume l is the lower hull length and p x the area at the midpoint of l every point of the curve represents the area value and if circular sections are used the radius of every section can be easily computed as the squared root of the area divided by π elliptical sections with a constant relation between their major to minor axis are also easy to obtain examples of lower hulls with constant displacement and length are presented in fig 8 with the formulation contoured hulls with bumps at the ends or in the middle can be defined just by considering the adequate values for the input parameters 4 2 a more general expression for the curves as reported in the previous section it is relatively easy to add more moments of area to the current formulation as it only implies solving a higher order integral expressed as a series of sines and cosines therefore a second moment of area or inertia will be added to the previous calculated expressions resulting in 13 i l 2 l 2 y 2 p y d y 1 1 p x l 2 3 x 2 p x d x 1 1 x 2 p x d x 8 i l 3 p x equations 4 5 and 13 set the new system that needs to be solved expression for p x now takes the form 14 p x a p 1 cos α a p 2 cos 3 α a p 3 cos 5 α b p 1 sin 2 α b p 2 sin 4 α b p 3 cos 6 α where as in the previous section the expression is to be integrated to obtain the area and moments of area this time the process has to be repeated three times the two first expressions have been derived on the previous section for m 2 and the result is independent of m therefore expressions 8 and 10 are identical in this case thus it is necessary to derive the third condition which is obtained from integrating expression 14 for a second moment of area which results in 15 1 1 x 2 p x d x a p 1 π 2 π 2 sin 2 α cos 2 α d α a p 2 π 2 π 2 sin 2 α cos α cos 3 α d α a p 3 π 2 π 2 sin 2 α cos α cos 5 α d α b p 1 π 2 π 2 sin 2 α cos α sin 2 α d α b p 2 π 2 π 2 sin 2 α cos α sin 4 α d α b p 3 π 2 π 2 sin 2 α cos α sin 6 α d α 8 i l 3 p x and obtaining each of the integrals separately the only terms that contribute are the first and the second so 16 a p 1 a p 2 π 4 8 i l 3 p x the final condition is given by forcing the curve to be 0 at its ends 17 a p 1 a p 2 a p 3 1 to sum up the coefficients to be imposed on the curve of equation 14 are 18 a p 1 4 a l π p x a p 2 a p 1 32 i l 3 π p x a p 3 1 a p 1 a p 2 b p 1 16 m l 2 π p x b p 2 0 b p 3 0 these coefficients are equivalent to the ones in 12 but enable the use of the curve s second moment of areas or inertia i with respect to the origin or the midpoint the use of the inertia alters mainly the shape of the curve at its ends so if inertia is reduced its ends will be thinner and vice versa fig 9 and fig 10 show the effect of including i into the curve s definition the curve in the middle does not include the inertia while the one on the top does it shapes are compared at the bottom of the figure with the shaded one being the curve with a modified inertia inertia has to be managed carefully to get realistic shapes otherwise unpractical curves may be obtained it is suggested to start with the original inertia of the curve which does not include the second area moment calculated as in section 4 1 and tune the inertia value starting from there examples of unrealistic shapes are illustrated in fig 11 starting with the same parameters as in fig 10 5 parametric design of swath hulls curves in the previous sections from equations 6 and 14 have been defined in terms of general parameters of area and moments however these can be related to the hydrodynamic parameters of a swath ship see table 1 establishing a methodology that allows to determine the hull and strut shapes in terms of the global parameters of the ship as will be detailed in this section some simplifications have to be assumed in order to relate global parameters with the geometric ones that define the curves as it has been described in the previous sections main parameters of a swath hull can be seen in fig 12 since awp waterplane area of one strut ts and ls are inputs the struts can be obtained first with eq 6 just considering the first area moment as a function of lcf with 19 l c f l s 2 x s m w p a w p m w p a w p l s 2 x s l c f notice that lcf is a positive magnitude and it is referred to the leading edge of the lower hull with the first moment mwp and the rest of inputs the constants of 6 can be obtained with the use of eq 12 so the strut section can be defined by extruding this section a magnitude t 1 the 3d strut is defined an intermediate strut that connects the upper strut with the lower body can be easily defined considering the points of the strut with an abscissa l i l s the extrusion distance of this intermediate strut will be t s t 1 fig 12 the displacement in terms of volume of one of the hulls can be expressed as the sum of the lower body displacement and the strut or struts if an intermediate strut is defined displacement according to the following expression 20 h i s s h i s a w p t 1 h 1 k a w p t 1 h 1 k a w p t 1 where the subscripts h is and s correspond to the lower hull intermediate strut and upper strut respectively awp is the waterplane area and ts the draught of the strut the volume of the intermediate strut is expressed here in terms of the upper strut and a coefficient accounting for the percentage of volume given to the intermediate strut as it can be seen in the case that the intermediate strut is not defined k 0 and the volume corresponds entirely to the upper strut i e in a short strut swath where l s l h there exists a similar relation to eq 19 to relate the first moment of area of the whole swath hull called m h with the hydrostatic coefficients of the ship this expression for the swath hull considered takes the form 21 l c b h l c b h s l c f x s l c b h l c b a w p t 1 l c f x s a w p t 1 m h h l h 2 l c b h notice that lcb and lcbh are referenced to the lower hull leading edge and that they are positive magnitudes considering the values of the lower hull displacement in eq 20 the first moment of area in eq 21 lb and also sx the area distribution of the lower hull can be obtained with eqs 6 and 12 with this area distribution the radius of every section of the lower hull can be easily obtained as explained in section 4 1 once the geometry of the strut and lower hull is obtained the leading and trailing edges of these bodies can be tuned up only considering the second moment of area as it was explained in section 4 2 as suggested in that section the second moment of area can produce unrealistic results fig 11 so it is better to change this value carefully considering as a reference the value of the curves that do not include the inertia into its definition 6 examples in order to test the applicability of the method the hulls of two different swath ships have been defined with the presented method maintaining most of the parameters for both ships but altering the shape of the lower hull between each other additionally the shape of the lower hull is computed in the first example without considering the inertia section 4 1 and considering it section 4 2 so the effect on the shape of this parameter is clearly shown the first example see table 2 and fig 13 corresponds to a conventional swath ship without bumps at its ends so it is defined to operate at low fn numbers 0 3 according to section 3 the parameters that define this ship appear on table 1 in this ship the lower hull is computed following section 4 1 so the inertia is not included into its definition the second example see table 2 and fig 14 is a modification of the previous one but in this case the area at the midpoint of the lower hull sx has been reduced since the displacement and lcb are maintained volume in the lower hull is shifted to the ends producing bulges and hence a swath hull designed to operate at a higher fn than in the previous example see fig 13 the volume at the ends of the lower hulls in example 2 was modified by reducing the inertia according to expressions in section 4 2 the original curve in red in fig 15 was calculated according expressions of section 4 1 and the final design coloured in blue reduces the inertia by a 9 5 in order to get finer ends in the lower hulls but keeping the enclosed volume circular sections have been used see fig 14 parameter k controlling the intermediate strut displacement value has been selected so the lower hulls of the two ships present the same displacement 7 conclusions in this work a new parametric methodology to build a b spline model for the preliminary design of swath ship hulls has been presented this methodology enables the definition of contoured hull shapes that overcome the traditional swath underwater hull definition with conic shapes contoured hulls have a better behaviour for high speed swath ships the method is based on the use of chebychev polynomials to define areas and moments of area that are subsequently linked to naval architecture parameters such as displacement lcb waterplane area and lcf defined in table 1 the relation of these hydrodynamic coefficients with hydrodynamics and stability characteristics is reviewed although the behaviour of the resulting hulls into these fields is not the objective in this work chebychev polynomials allow to define the underwater bodies that define a swath hull in a simple manner without solving non linear systems of equations therefore two sets of expressions are enough to define the strut or lower hulls shapes more equations can be added into the definition of the hull for example in this work a three equation model is described that includes the inertia as a design parameter to control the leading and trailing edges slenderness the curves obtained are easily extended to 3d by an extrusion struts and a revolution surface lower hulls circular sections for the lower hull can be easily converted into elliptical ones maintaining the enclosed area the position of the centroids lcf and lcb become the key aspect in order to get different shapes that makes further hull optimization of resistance and seakeeping characteristics possible this aspect has not been considered in previous parametric definitions of swath hulls since this work is focused on parametric definition of a swath geometry different swath examples are presented and the influence of the variation of different design parameters over the final shape is shown stating clearly that it is relatively simple to generate many different hulls future work may include optimization of swath hulls considering the parametric modelization that has been defined considering resistance seakeeping or stability characteristics according to a relevant merit criteria further geometric work may complete our presented hull definition including the box and decks following references papanikolau et al 1990 1991 or bondarenko et al 2013 these way aspects related with transport variables number of passengers deck area or related input will complete the swath parametric definition acknowledgements graphics powered by rhinoceros 3d and grasshopper thanks to robert mcneel thanks to elaine doigh and pablo de medina for

22177,a comprehensive accident analysis model is proposed to analyse the human factors that are involved in maritime accidents the model integrates the superiorities of hfacs fuzzy fta and ann hfacs is used to identify and classify human factors associated with 38 accidents which are re organized as basic events bes intermediate events ies and top event te developing the architecture of ft fuzzy aggregation analysis is employed to address expressions of experts obtaining the failure probabilities of the bes and an ann is established by matching the bes with variables at the input layer ies with the variables in the hidden layers and the te with the variable at the output layer the results show that the proposed ann based model has satisfactory performance in overcoming the drawbacks of fta the performance of the proposed model can be further improved through the introduction of newly available information data and the adjustment of the numbers of neurons assigned at the first and second hidden layers according to the architecture of ft the capability of anns based model to effectively handle uncertainties dynamics nonlinear associated with human risk factors is also ascertained through the application for the developed maritime accident scenario keywords fault tree analysis fuzzy theory artificial neural network hfacs maritime accidents 1 introduction over recent decades maximum effort has been made to provide safety navigation of ships at sea at national and international levels however a large number of maritime accidents still take place worldwide which result in immense loss of lives and property additionally the ocean environment is facing an oil pollution risk furthermore according to the statistics collected by eliopoulou and papanikolaou 2016 the serious marine accidents 1 1 serious marine accidents are casualties that result in structural damage rendering the ship unseaworthy or in a state of ship breakdown with actual total loss or with any other undefined situation that results in damage or financial loss that is considered to be serious that occurred from 2000 to 2012 worldwide are mainly attributable to general cargo ships and bulk carriers with 65 5 in 7391 serious maritime accidents in which collision is the second most frequent accident type some investigative reports for some of the typical maritime accidents are analysed and referred to in this study to verify the proposed methodology the causal system that leads to maritime accidents is characterized by high levels of complexity and uncertainty and it is critical to implement a causal investigation for improving the safety level of marine shipping according to the statistics and research on maritime accident causes an overwhelming part of maritime accidents approximately 75 96 are attributable to human factors pennie et al 2007 uğurlu et al 2015 and especially with the application of advanced technology in marine shipping this percentage could increase further therefore the shipping industry has been adopting more and more proactive measures for shipping operations and at the same time more and more regulations codes and guidelines are being made or amended by imo to ensure the safety level of the operators behaviours for example as early as the 1970s the importance of human factors including human error and organizational failure has received much attention internationally leading to the establishment of the well known international convention on standards of training certification and watchkeeping for seafarers stcw convention and the international convention for safety of life at sea solas which provides a set of detailed guidelines for staff working on board a ship apart from imo there are many other international organizations such as international labour organization ilo and the international association of ship classification societies iacs which show great concern about the safety of the operations during shipping under the framework of international conventions regulations and codes the national rules are harmonized to reinforce the effectiveness of the performance kristiansen 2008 although enormous endeavours are devoted to regulated human factors involved in marine operations at the international and national levels the occurrence frequency of human errors in marine accidents is still not satisfactory compared against the desired level gaonkar et al 2011 noroozi et al 2014 however it can be concluded that the introduction of various efforts to address human behaviours were effective at reducing the occurrence of maritime accidents considering the collision accidents associated with aframax tankers 2 2 aframax tankers are optimal for short to medium haul crude oil transportation aframax class tankers are largely used in the basins of the black sea the north sea the caribbean sea the south and east china seas and the mediterranean as an example as is shown in fig 1 eliopoulou and papanikolaou 2016 the decreasing trend can be identified with the development or revision of the regulations safety guidelines and codes 1 1 related work the large influence of human factors on maritime accidents has prompted an increase in this field over past decades the influence mechanism of human factors in the marine safety management process was analysed qualitatively by er and celik 2005 later a model based on human reliability assessment hra was established to analyse maritime accidents that occurred under greek purviews tzannatos and kokotos 2009 based on the consensus that the role of human factors is a central issue in accidents at sea hetherington et al 2006 chauvin 2011 many studies were performed to investigate the human factors that caused directly the occurrences of maritime accidents a maib report maib 2004 indicated that the most common contributing human factors were poor lookout for 65 of the vessels and poor use of radar 73 based on the analysis of 33 accidents at sea during the period of 1994 2003 in contrast perrow 1999 pointed out that difficulties in coordination were the main human factors that led to accidents at sea shortly afterward after analysing 59 accidents at sea pourzanjani 2001 observed that 46 duty officers had not clearly indicated their intention to manoeuvre and the reason for this omission is explored further by chauvin and lardjane 2008 who pointing out that the existence of different systems could be the potential cause for this failure except for the human errors mentioned above there are many other key factors that have contributed to accidents at sea according to the existing studies such as improper manning lack of competency inter ship communications and so on these studies yielded interesting and meaningful findings to some extent however they often paid much attention to some of these human errors and failed to provide a systematic analysis framework for the accidents at sea furthermore the relationships among different potential human errors were not presented in these studies which limits their applicability to solving practical engineering issues caused by human factors usually the evaluation of human factors involved in maritime accidents is obviously difficult due to the lack of data associated with human factors from the shipping industry therefore the analysis of human factors must address the uncertainty and fuzziness of the collected data currently a variety of evaluation methodologies have been introduced by safety scholars and practitioners these methodologies can be categorized into two main branches empirical techniques and expert judgement the former puts much more emphasis on the collection of data about human factors for example swain and guttmann 1983 established a large human reliability database in which the data stemming from the literature interviews and personnel experience were used to evaluate human factors additionally the shipping accidents data from 2000 to 2012 worldwide were collected by eleftheria et al 2016 to analyse the human errors involved in them expert judgement is being given increased attention due to excellent performance in addressing the complexity and uncertainty of human factor data the well known formal safety assessment fsa recommended by imo is widely used in the shipping industry to analyse human factors eleftheria et al 2016 according to the principle of fsa martins and matuna 2010 investigated the human failures that contribute to the collision and grounding of tankers by a quantitative approach later a comprehensive model was established by xi and guo 2011 to reveal the relationships among human errors and behaviour in the shipping industry then the cream model developed by hollnagel 1998 was introduced by yang and wang 2012 to explore the solution for marine accident prevention at the same time the hfacs was applied to analyse collisions at sea chauvin et al 2013 zhang 2019 to improve the performance of hfacs the cognitive map cm approach was integrated into hfacs forming the hfacs cm model to evaluate human factors that emerged in marine accidents akyuz and celik 2014 furthermore akyuz et al 2016 defined error producing conditions epcs including hfacs heart and analytic hierarchy process ahp to predict human errors that appeared in the shipping industry in addition the fuzzy bayesian network bn also received much attention in human factors analysis in marine accidents ung 2019 baksh 2019 based on the above observations we can conclude that the application of expert judgement and artificial intelligence would result in a tendency to address the uncertainty that is a characteristic of human factors the methodologies based on artificial intelligence are found useful and promising in modelling and solving nonlinear functional relationships for complex systems artificial neural networks anns are utilized in various fields especially for the cases of solving nonlinear singular problems involved in multi disciplinary areas raja et al 2018a ahmad et al 2019 such as astrophysics plasma physics atomic physics thermodynamics electromagnetic nanotechnology fluid mechanics electrohydrodynamic signal processing economic and finance etc sabir et al 2018 with outstanding performance for solving nonlinear issues the anns can deal with extensive uncertainties and dynamics associated with human factor analysis which cannot be effectively solved by traditional methodologies in addition raja et al 2018b proved that the anns can effectively solve a variety dynamical problems taking the nonlinear heat conduction model as an example coincidentally various dynamical relationships are involved in the causal system for the maritime accidents which are becoming an interesting topic for the accident investigators the bayesian networks bns have been proven as a practical approach for complex nonlinear system however the nonlinear dependencies among variables cannot be solved effectively by bns sarbayev et al 2019 while the ann based models are able to deal with nonlinear relationships among variables 1 2 innovative contribution the objective of the present study is to develop a comprehensive model integrated by hfacs fta fuzzy ahp as well as ann which is capable of resolving the uncertainty in the human factors involved in collisions at sea collisions at sea accident data in chinese waters were collected in this study to verify the proposed methodology a group of experts with navigation experience in chinese waters from the shipping industry and academia were employed as consultants during this research more specifically the present study is characterized by mapping the ft into ann under the framework of hfacs in which the processes of digitalization and data mining are applied to establish causal relationships by both machine learning and pattern recognition the proposed methodology in this study provides a complete process with steps and rules from the development of ft stemming from hfacs analysis to the mapping of ft into ann which can benefit the investigation of human factors involved in collision accidents at sea the salient features of the proposed methodology are listed as follows exploration in anns based model to investigate the human risk factors involved in the maritime accidents and validation of consistent precision through existing maritime accidents scenario establishment a methodology for integrating hfacs fuzzy fault tree and artificial neural network in the field of risk assessment the proposed anns based model is more effective for solving the nonlinear dependencies among various human factors set as variables at input layer contributing to maritime accidents compared with traditional analysis tools be capable of evaluating human risk factors for dynamic process and optimizing evaluation performance by updating network s parameters based on the newly available data 1 3 organization the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the overview of the research methodology the employed techniques and the data collection the model establishment process is presented in section 3 sections 4 and 5 present our discussion and conclusions 2 methodology and data collection the overview of the methodology proposed in this study is illustrated in fig 2 in which the integration of hfacs fta huzzy ahp and ann leads to the formation of a comprehensive model to analyse the human factors involved in collisions at sea as shown in fig 2 there is a total of 4 parts of this study part 1 hierarchical the structure of the human factors is obtained based on the hfacs framework part 2 modelling the fault tree is developed according to the hierarchical structure designed in step 1 part 3 fuzzy ahp is employed to calculate the failure probability of basic events and top events in the ft part 4 map this step maps the ft into an ann 2 1 fuzzy theory usually there are three main approaches to addressing the failure probability statistical methods extrapolation and expert judgement preyssl 1995 in this study the expert judgement approach is chosen as a scientific consensus technique to weight the identified human factors that are involved in the collisions at sea and to rank the expert capability however since experts tend to express their opinions on each event based on their individual knowledge purpose and intellectual characteristics ford and sterman 1998 different analysis models have been established such as fuzzy priority relations game theory the max min delphi method and the similarity aggregation method sam it is difficult to identify a technique that is superior to the others for aggregating expert opinions liu et al 2014 however it is widely accepted that ambiguous expression from experts is extremely common thus the integration of fuzzy set theory and the ahp is frequently utilized to aggregate the experts ambiguity since van laarhoven and pedrycz 1983 fuzzy set theory has been introduced to ahp because the experts are more inclined to give fuzzy judgements than crisp expressions wang et al 2008 according to fuzzy set theory a fuzzy number chang 1996 can be defined such that m f r can be called a fuzzy number if we have the following 1 μ m x 0 1 x 0 r a α x μ a α x a α 0 1 where f r represents all fuzzy sets r is the set of real numbers and μ is the membership function practically speaking triangular and trapezoidal fuzzy numbers can be regarded as alternatives and which one is more suitable depends on the detailed situation based on the definition of the aforementioned fuzzy number we can define a fuzzy number m on r as a triangular fuzzy number if its membership function μ m x r 0 1 is equal to the following 2 μ m x x a 2 a 1 a 1 a 2 a 1 x a 1 a 2 a 3 a 3 a 2 x a 2 a 1 x a 2 a 3 0 o t h e r w i s e where a 1 a 2 a 3 a 1 and a 3 represent the lower and upper values of m respectively and a 2 represents the modal value in this way a triangular fuzzy number can be denoted as m a 1 a 2 a 3 in fact m is a non fuzzy number if a 1 a 2 a 3 similarly the membership function of a trapezoidal fuzzy number n a 1 a 2 a 3 a 4 can be derived as follows 3 μ n x x a 2 a 1 a 1 a 2 a 1 x a 1 a 2 1 x a 2 a 3 a 4 a 4 a 3 x a 4 a 3 x a 3 a 4 0 o t h e r w i s e considering two different triangular fuzzy numbers m 1 and m 2 m 1 a 1 a 2 a 3 and m 2 b 1 b 2 b 3 the following operational laws can be observed 4 m 1 m 2 a 1 a 2 a 3 b 1 b 2 b 3 a 1 b 1 a 2 b 2 a 3 b 3 5 m 1 m 2 a 1 a 2 a 3 b 1 b 2 b 3 a 1 b 1 a 2 b 2 a 3 b 3 6 λ m 1 λ a 1 a 2 a 3 λ a 1 λ a 2 λ a 3 λ 0 λ r 7 m 1 1 a 1 a 2 a 3 1 1 a 1 1 a 2 1 a 3 the linguistic expression of experts is critically valuable to handling complex circumstances and obtaining meaningful conclusions however the linguistic expression can be various and highly ambiguous therefore the relationships developed between the ambiguous expression of experts and the corresponding fuzzy numbers are extremely significant several attempts have been made to convert the ambiguous linguistic expressions into their corresponding fuzzy numbers i e miller 1956 nicolis 1985 and chen and hwang 1992 currently the approach established by chen and hwang 1992 is widely accepted as shown in table 1 as is shown in table 1 the verbal expressions associated with the aimed events are represented in eight scales from scale one which contains two verbal terms medium and high to scale eight which contains thirteen verbal terms from none to excellent based on the studies by nicolis 1985 ramzali et al 2015 proposed that the estimation of human memory aptitude is seven terms plus or minus two patches which indicates that the appropriate number of verbal terms is between five and nine terms for human factor identification issues implemented via expert judgement methodology 2 2 optimized hfacs framework the initial hfacs stems from the swiss cheese model which emphasizes the organizational dimension of accident causation reason 1990 it consists of four layers unsafe acts preconditions for unsafe acts unsafe supervision and organizational factors which were proposed by shappell and wiegmann 2000 later reinach and viale 2006 suggested that the accident causation should be extended beyond the organization such as to the economy law and policy which can be regarded as a supplement in the hfacs called the fifth layer based on the five layers of hfacs the human and organizational factors involved in marine accidents were analysed by chauvin et al 2013 in addition the modified hfacs framework with five layers has been widely applied to classify and identify accident causation associated with human factors based on accident reports for the applications of the hfacs framework to specific cases it is noted that the human factors on each layer are interpreted in specific situations which indicates that the factors on each layer could continuously change according to the investigation tasks in the present study an hfacs based collisions at sea risk analysis model is developed to identify and classify the human factors that are involved in collisions the proposed model consists of five layers and 15 categories which is illustrated in fig 3 obviously this model is established as a five level framework and it is similar to hfacs coll chauvin et al 2013 hfacs grounding chen et al 2013 and hfacs mam mazaheri et al 2015 however it should be pointed out that the proposed hfacs model includes a special layer called a hazard situation which is regarded as a supplement to the standard hfacs framework actually the introduction of a hazard situation is aimed at facilitating the modelling process of the fault tree which will be discussed further next in section 2 3 2 3 fault tree analysis fta is a widely used technique to estimate the safety and reliability of safety critical systems such as ship grounding accident causation analysis kum and sahin 2015 explosions in oil tankers wang et al 2013 and lng carrier accident analysis zhou et al 2017 within the framework of fta the failure probability of the system can be decomposed into different types of failures and further into failure causes until it enters the category of elementary failure causes which cannot be decomposed any more the typical ft is usually presented as a directed acyclic graph which consists of the following components top event te the root of the ft which is usually decomposed into a series of different events also called the top level event tle basic events bes bes are the leaves of the acyclic graph which cannot be decomposed any more intermediate events ie ies are represented by a combination of bes and other ies through the logic gates mentioned above and they are critical in illustrating the process of system failure evolution especially those ies that decompose into bes gates gates usually refers to boolean connectors the and and or are used most frequently which is utilized to specify how the failures of the children combine to cause the failures of systems in the ft model the failure probability of te could be computed through the failure probabilities distribution of the bes during which the logical relationships established among the bes and ies would be critical according to mathematical logic theory the logical relationships that emerge in the ft the or and and gates can be calculated by the formulas shown in eqs 8 and 9 respectively as follows 8 φ x i 1 n x i x 1 x 2 x 3 x n 9 ψ x i 1 n x i x 1 x 2 x 3 x n where φ x and ψ x are the tes that describe the state of the complex system and x i denotes the i t h basic contributing factors namely the bes the output φ x represented by the or gate appears under the condition of at least one input factor while the output ψ x represented by the and gate occurs under the condition of having two input factors lee et al 1985 in the present study the elements including te ies and bes involved in the ft can be transformed from the aforementioned hfacs framework and the transforming process is illustrated in fig 4 the human factors that cause the occurrences of collisions at sea identified from level 1 to level 5 under the framework of hfacs are mapped into the structure of the ft as basic events at the same time the collisions at sea in the hfacs framework correspond to the top events in the ft model the hazard situations identified would be transferred into intermediate events in the ft which is the reason why a layer of hazard situations is introduced into the proposed hfacs framework in this study 2 4 artificial neural network with the development of computational tools anns are created gradually and they have been widely applied as computational techniques for modelling and forecasting in various fields chitsazan et al 2015 compared with the bn anns have a distinct advantage of modelling the correlation between the input variables while bn assumes that all of the elementary events are independent sarbayev et al 2019 usually the ann is characterized by having the capacity to detect nonlinear relationships among the inputs and outputs of a system with no need for detailed information or data on the physical systems which is suitable for those systems with high uncertainty the interconnected neurons in the ann are organized as a layered structure in other words the output of each neuron from the sub layer is one of the inputs to each neuron of the next layer with which the transfer function is used on the input signal of each neuron illias et al 2015 in a developed ann model the networks can learn from known examples and subsequently identify functional relationships among the data when the original relationships are unknown ashtiani and shahsavari 2016 therefore the capacity of an ann is evaluated by the selection of training data sets and the network architecture seifeddine et al 2012 2 4 1 algorithm for ann the principle of the proposed methodology of ann based model is presented in fig 5 all the neurons are allocated at input layer hidden layer and the output layer the input neurons form the input vector x x 1 x 2 x i x n a weight vector is formed by weights leading from the preceding layer to the exist layer denoted as w j w 1 j w i j w n j where w i j represents the connection weight from the i th node in the preceding layer to the j th node in the existing layer in addition θ θ 0 θ 1 θ j is defined as the bias vector of the proposed ann where θ 0 is the bias from the last hidden layer to the output layer and j indicates the number of hidden layers after the input vector and the initiation values for weights and bias are given the prediction values will be obtained from the output layer by the feedforward ann which is represented by the following chitsazan et al 2015 10 y j k f 1 θ j i w i j i i k 11 y k θ 0 j w j y j k where y j k is the output value of the j th neuron of the hidden layer y k is the k th predicted value k represents the number of neurons at the output layer i i k denotes the i th input for the k th input vector f 1 is the transfer function also known as activation function which is the sigmoid function in the present study 12 f 1 t 1 1 e t for the purpose of network learning the back propagation algorithm is adopted to error computations and updating all the weights and biases the levenberg marquardt l m algorithm is applied in this study for updating weights and biases to minimize the error the mathematical expression is given as 13 x k 1 x k j t j μ i 1 j t e where j t is the jacobian of the performance function for weights and biases e represents the error vector of the proposed network i is the identity matrix and μ denotes the scalar value to ensure decrease continuously of the value of performance function the abovementioned process will be repeated continuously to optimize network s performance until the calculated error satisfies the pre defined goal tolerance requirement basheer and hajmeer 2000 among the lists of methods utilized to minimize the overall error the mean squared error mse is preferred and is widely used sarbayev et al 2019 the function for the mse is expressed as follows 14 m s e 1 n m 1 n y 0 y p r e 2 where y 0 is the observed network output and y p r e is the predicted output of the network 2 4 2 configuration of ann parameters selecting a suitable configuration and suitable parameters for the designed ann is important for the topic to be studied in most cases more than one hidden layer is embedded in the artificial neutral network which is determined by the modelling requirements for a limited case a model without the hidden layers can only be capable of representing linearly separable functions or decisions an artificial neutral network with three or more hidden layers has been proved to be less practicable due to its complexity and long training time without a sufficient increase in its efficiency heaton 2017 karsoliya 2012 in practice the artificial neutral network with two hidden layers has been widely utilized for the issues to be solved in addition to the number of hidden layers the number of neurons in each hidden layer could also make a considerable difference toward the performance of the whole network an inappropriate number of neurons at each hidden layer would lead to the occurrence of over fitting or under fitting problems to solve this problem many rule of thumb methods have been proposed to determine the appropriate number of neurons assigned at each hidden layer the following rules are selected for the present study which are proposed with reference to panchal and panchal 2017 and sarbayev et al 2019 from the practice of perspective these rules will be tested and validated in section 4 4 in the present study 1 the total number of neurons assigned at all hidden layers should not exceed the number of neurons in the input layer 2 the total number of neurons in all hidden layers should be the sum of 2 3 neurons in the input layers and the neurons in the output layer 3 if the second rule is not practicable it is recommended that the number of neurons in the first hidden layer should be the number of ies directly connected with bes in the ft 4 following the third rule the number of neurons in the second hidden layer should be the number of ies in the ft minus the number of ies directly connected with the bes 2 5 data collection a data base associated with maritime accidents must be established to illustrate the developed methodology according to the annual report of maritime accidents in china from 2015 to 2018 maritime accidents associated with sand carriers operating in the domestic waters in china have gained considerable attention due to enormous loss of life and property in the present study maritime accidents associated with sand carriers occurring in china in 2018 are selected as the database 38 accidents totally it should be noted that only the accident causations mentioned in the accident reports and obtained from the accident investigators are considered and processed based on the analysis model proposed in this study 3 model establishment the implementation for the proposed model is illustrated in fig 6 including the graphical mapping algorithm and the modelling rules the main steps and roles are described in detail below 3 1 hfacs analysis for sand carrier accidents 3 1 1 description of the proposed hfacs in this section the detailed information for the hfacs model of sand carrier accidents is described based on the framework proposed in section 2 2 the five different levels for the human risk factors involved in sand carrier accidents are denoted by r1 r5 in the following content if there is no special instruction the detailed information for each level is shown in table 2 3 1 2 classification and hierarchical structure of the identified human risk factors in this section the human risk factors that cause the occurrence of sand carrier accidents are analysed and classified according to the knowledge of experts in this way the hierarchical structure of the identified risk factors is established which facilitates the embedment of these risk factors into the ft model the expert judgement method has been widely adopted in different fields including risk analysis accident investigation decision examination and so on in most situations expert elicitation is applied to accumulated specialist opinions about a subject when available resources are lacking or limited by physical circumstances yazdi et al 2017 thus expert competence is critically significant for scientific conclusions the selection of capable experts can be established according to the following criteria compared with a homogenous group of experts a heterogeneous group is usually preferred in a heterogeneous group the individual experience of each expert receives considerable attention which enables the consideration of all possible specialist opinions from various viewpoints yazdi et al 2017 with respect to the education and experience of the experts in a field the longer they have focused on a subject academic or practical subject the more accurate their intuitionistic judgement is with respect to expert familiarity with a subject especially through practical experience an experienced specialist can master every detail of the subject in the present study according to the aforementioned selection principle a heterogeneous group of experts was selected for calculating the impact rate of human errors involved in the marine accident scenario and five experts were employed to judge the human factors the weight of each expert was evaluated based on their background and expertise celik et al 2010 lavasani et al 2015 specifically the following four aspects were considered professional position educational level job experience and age miri lavasani et al 2011 omidvari et al 2014 additionally considering the particularity of the marine shipping industry the competency level of the selected experts was also included therefore a total of five aspects are used for evaluating the expert capability as shown in fig 7 as mentioned earlier five experts were employed to give their opinions on the human errors that underlie marine accidents to improve the heterogeneity of the expert group the experts in this study represent different fields associated with marine shipping including a marine safety supervisor marine safety senior scholar experienced marine engineer officer marine engineering specialist and navigation specialist all of them have seafaring experience except for the senior scholar whose focus of study is safety evaluation in marine transportation one of the experts currently works as a senior marine accident investigator and holds a master s degree and senior captain competency certificate all of the relevant information of the five experts is summarized in detail in table 3 official accident reports are essential for risk factor analysis they present valuable and detailed information about the accident mazaheri et al 2015 therefore as the first step the accident s contributory factors mentioned in the official accident reports are considered and listed considering the limitation of the accident database employed in the present study we interviewed some shipping companies that were operating sand carriers in coastal areas and seafarers who had experience working on the sand carriers in addition a literature review is a useful approach for us to identify the risk factors associated with ship accidents in the coastal area chauvin et al 2013 in this way even if we do not have a sufficient number of accident reports we still will not miss the risk factors that lead to the occurrence of sand carrier accidents finally the risk factors that stem from accident reports interviews and literature reviews are identified in table 4 in the second step the risk factors identified aforementioned would be classified based on the hfacs model illustrated in section 2 2 the classification process is implemented with the assistance of four experts who have industry experience or research experience as with the sand carrier in coastal areas all of the risk factors would be classified according to the five risk levels described in the hfacs model namely unsafe acts preconditions for unsafe acts unsafe supervision organizational factors and external factors the classification results would be adopted in cases where at least three experts judgements are consistent otherwise the classification results would be discussed face to face among the employed experts until consistent judgements are obtained as the last step the hierarchical structure of the risk factors is established based on the classification results under the framework of the hfacs model as shown in fig 8 3 1 3 statistical analysis there is no doubt that every ship accident is caused by many different risk factors and the cause of each accident almost always varies from the others according to zhang 2019 and chen et al 2013 the proposed statistical analysis procedure in the present study consists of two parts namely the occurrence frequency analysis of the risk factors and the cause consequence analysis occurrence frequency analysis of risk factors the risk factors that contribute to the sand carrier accidents are analysed statistically one by one according to the accident reports about the 38 sand carrier accidents the results of the statistical analysis are presented in fig 9 according to fig 9 it can be found that r2 2 incompetent crew r3 2 lack of situational awareness and r2 5 inappropriate emergency operation are ranked as the top three most frequency human risk factors which have presented at more than 8 sand carrier accidents it should be noted that some human risk factors are not mentioned in the accident reports such as r2 10 poor communication and r3 4 lack of navigation publication but they are indeed the human risk factors that contribute to sand carrier accidents according to the expert judgement and literature review described in section 3 1 2 even if there are different occurrence frequencies all of the human risk factors identified in the present study would cause sand carrier accidents which is the basis for the ft modelling in the following section cause consequence analysis the consequences caused by the identified human risk factors namely hazardous situations would be elaborated and defined in this section based on expert judgement and discussion meetings the process and results of the cause consequence analysis are presented in fig 10 which is another basis for the establishment of the ft model in the following section fig 10 shows the memberships between the human risk factors identified in section 3 1 2 called basic events in the ft model and the hazardous situation ranking from e1 to e10 which is part of the intermediate events in the ft model all of the intermediate events connect to the top event and the basic events are presented in table 5 according to the human risk factors analysis principal proposed in this study the intermediate events involved in the sand carrier accidents are composed of two groups namely primary intermediate events and senior intermediate events specifically the primary intermediate events itemized as e1 e2 e3 e10 are characterized as the intermediate events directed by the basic events while the senior intermediate events itemized as m1 m2 m6 are defined as the intermediate events that connect the top events and the primary intermediate events 3 2 fault tree modelling based on hfacs the ft model for the sand carrier accidents would be established on the basis of the proposed statistical analysis procedure mentioned above and the developed hierarchical structure of the risk factors there are various human risk factors that can lead to the occurrence of sand carrier accidents which are defined as basic events under the framework of ft then the causality and consequence among these accident risk factors are analysed based on the hazard situations and events according to the statistical analysis results shown in fig 10 where the hazardous situation would be acted on as the primary intermediate events in the ft in other words the basic events will direct to these hazardous situations as is shown in fig 10 subsequently the preliminary fault tree is developed as a supplement the experts knowledge and existing research are utilized to improve the ft by replenishing some of the human risk factors that are not presented in the sand carrier accident reports finally the ft model is developed as shown in fig 11 in the developed ft model the sand carrier accident is defined as the top event which is contributed to by a series of intermediate events most of them are the hazardous situations defined in fig 10 the human risk factors classified under the framework of hfacs are denoted as the basic events in the ft the human risk factors can be aggregated as two groups namely operational faults and lack of effective supervision and from the perspective of causal logical principles they are defined as senior intermediate events which connect the primary intermediate events and the top event in the ft here the description for all of the symbols presented in the ft can be referred to in table 5 3 3 expert elicitation and aggregation of data to address any cognitive biases that are presented by individual expert viewpoints it is vital to aggregate expert opinions first expert capabilities must be weighted and scored and the indicators for these expert capabilities can vary according to specific scenario details such as professional position experience education and so on before evaluating an expert s capabilities his her score rating is developed then pairwise comparison matrices are established according to a particular expert s details about the scores of their capabilities indicator these matrices can be further processed as follows until the weight of the individual expert is calculated buckley 1985 with respect to fuzzy numbers in pairwise comparison matrices the geometric mean technique is applied to obtain the synthetic pairwise comparison matrix b b i j as follows 15 b i j a 1 i j a 2 i j a k i j 1 4 where a k a k i j is the pairwise comparison matrix of the k t h indicator for the expert capability evaluation the fuzzy weights of the criteria for each expert can be calculated by the following 16 r i b i 1 b i 2 b i n 1 n where the fuzzy weight of the i t h expert is indicated by r i the fuzzy weights for each criterion are defined as follows 17 w i r i r 1 r 2 r n 1 where w i l w i m w i u w i denotes the fuzzy weight of the i t h criterion in which l w i m w i u w i indicate the lower middle and upper values of the fuzzy weights of the i t h criterion respectively the weight of each expert is computed by employing the centre of area technique namely as follows 18 p e i 1 3 u w i l w i m w i l w i l w i suppose that every expert e i i 1 2 3 n states his or her specific viewpoint about a certain feature by using a predefined set of linguistic variables these linguistic expressions can then be converted into their corresponding triangular or trapezoidal fuzzy numbers which can be processed as follows until defuzzification is achieved 1 calculation of the degree of similarity s u v e u e v is defined as the degree of agreement for different opinions between each pair of experts suppose that e u a 1 a 2 a 3 and e v b 1 b 2 b 3 are represented as two standard triangular fuzzy numbers u v then the degree of agreement between e u and e v can be obtained by the following 19 s u v e u e v 1 1 j i 1 j a i b i i 1 2 3 where j is the number of fuzzy set members e g j 3 is for standard triangular fuzzy numbers and j 4 for standard trapezoidal fuzzy numbers additionally the greater the values of s u v e u e v are the better the similarity between expert e u and e v 2 calculation for the average of agreement aa degree for each expert viewpoint 20 a a e u 1 u 1 u v v 1 u s u v e u e v where u is the total number of experts 3 calculation for the relative agreement ra degree between two types of experts the value of r a e u for the u t h expert can be obtained by the following 21 r a e u a a e u u 1 u a a e u 4 estimation of the consensus coefficient cc for each expert the value of c c e u for the u t h expert can be obtained by the following 22 c c e u β p e u 1 β r a e u where the coefficient β 0 β 1 is introduced to represent the importance of p e u over r a e u namely the greater the value of β is the greater the importance of p e u actually when β 0 there is no weight is distributed to p e u which indicates that a homogenous group of experts is employed another limit case β 1 indicates that the consensus degree among the various experts viewpoints is adequately high 5 calculation for the aggregated results of the experts viewpoints the aggregated results denoted by r a can be computed by the following 23 r a c c e 1 e 1 c c e 2 e 2 c c e u e u 6 defuzzification of the aggregated results the defuzzification of the fuzzy numbers is critically important for the application of fuzzy set theory the method of center of area coa is widely used for the defuzzification operation which is expressed as follows 24 x μ m x x d x μ m x d x where x represents the defuzzification result and μ m x indicates the aggregated membership functions defined in 2 and 3 for fuzzy triangular and trapezoidal numbers respectively therefore the fuzzy numbers of the aggregated results denoted as r a c 1 c 2 c 3 for fuzzy triangular numbers or r a c 1 c 2 c 3 c 4 for fuzzy trapezoidal numbers can be defuzzified by 25 and 26 respectively as follows 25 r a c 1 c 2 x c 2 c 2 c 1 x d x c 2 c 3 c 3 x c 3 c 2 x d x c 1 c 2 x c 2 c 2 c 1 d x c 2 c 3 c 3 x c 3 c 2 d x c 1 c 2 c 3 3 26 r a c 1 c 2 x c 1 c 2 c 1 x d x c 2 c 3 x d x c 3 c 4 c 4 x c 4 c 3 x d x c 1 c 2 x c 1 c 2 c 1 d x c 2 c 3 d x c 3 c 4 c 4 x c 4 c 3 d x 1 3 c 4 c 3 2 c 2 c 1 2 c 4 c 3 c 1 c 2 c 4 c 3 c 2 c 1 3 4 mapping the fta into the ann 3 4 1 probability calculation of basic events in the fta the probabilities of basic events are calculated by expert consultation as mentioned in section 3 1 2 five experts with different backgrounds are employed in the present study the rating criteria in table 6 are used to score the capability of every expert in the heterogeneous group every indicator is scaled from one to five except for the age term because age is less important than the other indicators herein the higher the score is the more important the expert is considered to be according to the evidence presented in table 3 the weight of each expert is different therefore based on the facts shown in table 3 the capability of each expert is first scored according to the rating criteria presented in table 6 then the pairwise comparison matrices are calculated finally the weight of each expert is calculated by utilizing formulas 15 18 as summarized in table 7 information concerning expert opinions for the failure rate of linguistic expressions is given in appendix a all of the experts employed in this study are given equal input in the group decision making process and are independent from each other the similarity aggregation method sam is applied to aggregate the expert opinions presented in appendix a including the important allocation of an appropriate value of β indicating the importance of the experts hsu and chen 1996 however yazdi et al 2017 showed that the value of β was not sensitive during fuzzy multiple attribute decision making in an aircraft landing system and β 0 5 was considered to be the optimal value therefore in this study β was assigned a value of 0 5 to balance the importance of the expert weights and the consensus degree of the different expert opinions following the calculation principle presented in section 3 3 every human factor can be aggregated as a trapezoidal fuzzy number by 17 21 followed by a defuzzification process utilizing 22 and 24 the results for the aggregation of the experts opinions and defuzzification are represented in table 8 to convert the impact rate of the human factors crisp failure probability into a failure probability the approach proposed by onisawa 1990 was employed to develop the functional relationship between the fp of the human factors and the cfp presented in table 8 3 4 2 data acquisition in this section data for the development of the ann is collected and generated as mentioned above in 2 4 the larger the amount of data that is collected the better the performance of the established ann model however in the present study the database that contains 38 sand carrier accidents fails to satisfy the requirement of an excellent ann model therefore a random probability generation function is necessary due to the unavailability of actual site data which is proposed by sarbayev et al 2019 under the assumption of normal distributions a set of 500 random probabilities are generated for each basic event illustrated in fig 9 during which the means and standard deviations of the given normal distributions are the probabilities listed in tables 8 and 15 respectively matlab r2017b was employed to generate the required data for the training and test of the ann in other words the function randn embedded in matlab was applied in the computational code for the established fault tree to generate 500 samples of be failure probabilities as with the probabilities of te they can be calculated according to the methodology proposed by ozkan et al 2013 based on the main principle of calculation described in section 2 3 finally the data samples for the training and testing of the ann were obtained in the present study 3 4 3 ann establishment based on the ft structure in fig 11 the proposed ann in the present study was established as in fig 12 and the structure of the ann for sand carrier accidents analysis was developed according to the graphical mapping algorithm fig 4 computation process fig 6 and mapping rules proposed in section 2 3 for the established ann shown in fig 13 all of the generated 500 sets of data were divided into two groups 450 sets were dedicated to be the training data and 50 sets of data were for the testing of the proposed ann model all of the basic events be1 be2 be24 were treated as the neurons in the input layer of the ann while the top event was regarded as the neuron at the output layer of the ann according to the typical rule of thumb a feedforward backpropagation type artificial network with two hidden layers was employed to address the issues in the present study according to the principles described in section 2 4 the proposed ann parameters are listed as follows i ten neurons were included in the first hidden layer while six neurons were in the second hidden layer ii the initiation values for weights and biases are generated by xavier initialization method iii the 24 bes obtained from fta are set as the neurons at the input layer and the failure probabilities of bes form the input vector for the network iv the function of levenberg marquardt backpropagation defined as tainlm in matlab r2017b was selected as the training function v the performance function for the ann model was set to mse vi the transfer functions were selected as the logsig for the neurons in the first and second hidden layers and linear for the output layer vii the training process would cease when the subset error rate increased for more than ten epoch iterations in a row 4 results and discussion 4 1 performance check for the proposed ann the performance check was implemented by comparing the results obtained from fta and the proposed ann which is based on the fifty data samples generated by matlab as mentioned above for testing purposes as the first step the fta would be applied to the fifty data samples as the input data to calculate the probabilities for the top event in the fault tree then the fifty data samples regarded as different bes would be treated as the input neurons of the proposed ann one by one and the corresponding probabilities of the top event as the output neuron were predicted through running the computational code the resulting differences between the fta and ann were presented in fig 13 based on the differences shown in fig 13 it is obviously found that the maximum value of the differences between ann and fta is 0 01053 and the mean value of the differences is derived as 0 00508 in addition according to the equation 14 in section 2 4 the mean squared error mse is calculated as 3 831e 5 which indicates satisfied matches between the two models the potential application of models based on ann in the maritime risk evaluation is to be explored for different cases 4 2 the advantage of the combination of the ann and the fta the ann based models are trained utilizing the database by adjusting the values of the synaptic weights and biases in the network which results in the development of mathematical relationships between the input and output variables from the perspective of running principles the ann based model could be established without the development of the ft however the identification of the input variables of the ann based model could be challenging in risk analysis or accident analysis especially for complex systems at the same time the fault tree has been proven to be an effective approach to analyse casualty causing accidents or risks therefore it is more beneficial to apply fta to identify the basic events that cause the occurrence of risk or accidents which are selected as the input variables for the ann based model the structure of fault tree may be different for various maritime accident scenario or different types of accidents e g the number of bes is changeable and the influence on the performance of the proposed ann based model is studied with the assumption of 22 bes deleting r2 1 and r1 5 all of the mapping process is the same as described above including the same algorithm hidden layer structure data generation process but the change of the number of neurons on input layer from 24 to 22 after computation the maximum and mean values of differences were 0 0138 and 0 00496 respectively then 2 new bes were added with new dataset for 50 failure probabilities the parameters of the newly developed ann were adopted as those of in the present ann while the parameters for the newly added neurons were set as default values the maximum and mean values of differences were 0 01098 and 0 00145 respectively however in case of training the same ann without adoption of the present parameters namely all the parameters of new ann were set as the default values the maximum and mean values of differences were 0 01314 and 0 00405 respectively the results show that it can be beneficial for the newly developed ann to adopt the parameters of the existing ann in the case of changing the structure of fault tree 4 3 the effect of new availability of data to the developed ann considering the practice some more new data could become available thereby it is necessary to consider whether the established ann model should be updated to re evaluate the failure probability of the top event in the fault tree therefore this situation was simulated in the present study by introducing other sets of new training samples as newly available data in this study 200 new training samples would put into the database by 50 training samples one time e g the proposed ann based model will run 4 times during the implementation of the experiments the parameters of the ann referring to connections and biases would be updated continuously by transferring the existing parameters to the new experiment the results regarding the all 4 experiments were illustrated in table 9 the first group results for no new data is set as 450 training samples in the database as mentioned above it is obviously found that both the maximum and mean values of differences are decreasing continuously with the addition of new available data into the database which indicates that the performance of the proposed ann based model was improved by the availability of the new data for the failure analysis 4 4 the effect of different numbers of hidden neurons on the network performance for a proposed ann based model although the structure of the network would be designed according to some rules which can be described as in section 3 3 the performance of the model can still be affected by some factors it should be noted that the number of neurons in the hidden layers is presented as one of the important factors that could make some difference in the performance of the ann based model thus different numbers of neurons in the hidden layers were adopted for the training of the proposed ann based model using the same data set generated for bes and te in the present study the results for each case with a different combination of the numbers of neurons in the hidden layers are presented in table 9 which describes the mean and maximum differences between the outputs of the ann based model and the testing values of the failure probabilities of the te the results presented in table 10 illustrate that the ann based model that is composed of 10 and 6 neurons in the first and second hidden layers has better performance the effectiveness of the rule of thumb rules proposed in this paper is also validated according to the results presented in table 9 furthermore in addition to the architecture of the proposed ann based model the training data set volume could also influence the performance of the proposed model therefore to obtain optimized performance of the ann based model it is necessary to develop a well organized architecture for the model while collecting as much as data with good quality 5 conclusions the present study attempts to propose a comprehensive methodology for marine accident analysis associated with human factors by mapping the fuzzy ft into an ann ft has been validated as an effective risk assessment tool in accident analysis however the disadvantages of being static ignoring the interdependency among basic events and so on limit its application toward more complex and digitalized systems the ann is widely used as a data driven modelling technique to address complex non linear relationships among variables but it is critical and often difficult to define the input variables in the present study focusing on the human factors involved in the 38 coastal sand carrier accidents that occurred in china the risk factors are identified and classified into five levels under the framework of hfacs the risk factors on each level correspond to the basic events while the intermediate events correspond to the hazardous situations that derive from the identified risk factors and the top event corresponds to the occurrence of an accident based on the hierarchical structure of the developed ft the input and output variables of the proposed ann based model were well identified and in addition the number of neurons variables assigned in the first and second hidden layers could be confirmed the application of the proposed ann based model to coastal sand carrier accidents shows that the ann can perform well if the numbers of neurons in the hidden layers are defined based on the numbers of intermediate events in the ft the results also illustrate that the introduction of newly available data information aiming at optimizing training could improve the performance of the proposed ann based model and in addition the performance of this model can also be optimized by adjusting the architecture of the ann according to the present study overall the present study provides an integrated analysis framework and methodology to address the information involved in the coastal sand carrier accidents in china which can benefit to understand and predict the risk factors that cause the sand carrier accidents the proposed anns based methodology in the present study is an entirely data driven model in future the potential work will be devoted to improving the performance of the methodology by adding newly available data associated with maritime accidents which continuously updates the parameters of the proposed artificial networks in additions further research work associated with the present study is to develop practical application by standardizing of the evaluation process under the proposed model work associated with the abovementioned issues is under

22177,a comprehensive accident analysis model is proposed to analyse the human factors that are involved in maritime accidents the model integrates the superiorities of hfacs fuzzy fta and ann hfacs is used to identify and classify human factors associated with 38 accidents which are re organized as basic events bes intermediate events ies and top event te developing the architecture of ft fuzzy aggregation analysis is employed to address expressions of experts obtaining the failure probabilities of the bes and an ann is established by matching the bes with variables at the input layer ies with the variables in the hidden layers and the te with the variable at the output layer the results show that the proposed ann based model has satisfactory performance in overcoming the drawbacks of fta the performance of the proposed model can be further improved through the introduction of newly available information data and the adjustment of the numbers of neurons assigned at the first and second hidden layers according to the architecture of ft the capability of anns based model to effectively handle uncertainties dynamics nonlinear associated with human risk factors is also ascertained through the application for the developed maritime accident scenario keywords fault tree analysis fuzzy theory artificial neural network hfacs maritime accidents 1 introduction over recent decades maximum effort has been made to provide safety navigation of ships at sea at national and international levels however a large number of maritime accidents still take place worldwide which result in immense loss of lives and property additionally the ocean environment is facing an oil pollution risk furthermore according to the statistics collected by eliopoulou and papanikolaou 2016 the serious marine accidents 1 1 serious marine accidents are casualties that result in structural damage rendering the ship unseaworthy or in a state of ship breakdown with actual total loss or with any other undefined situation that results in damage or financial loss that is considered to be serious that occurred from 2000 to 2012 worldwide are mainly attributable to general cargo ships and bulk carriers with 65 5 in 7391 serious maritime accidents in which collision is the second most frequent accident type some investigative reports for some of the typical maritime accidents are analysed and referred to in this study to verify the proposed methodology the causal system that leads to maritime accidents is characterized by high levels of complexity and uncertainty and it is critical to implement a causal investigation for improving the safety level of marine shipping according to the statistics and research on maritime accident causes an overwhelming part of maritime accidents approximately 75 96 are attributable to human factors pennie et al 2007 uğurlu et al 2015 and especially with the application of advanced technology in marine shipping this percentage could increase further therefore the shipping industry has been adopting more and more proactive measures for shipping operations and at the same time more and more regulations codes and guidelines are being made or amended by imo to ensure the safety level of the operators behaviours for example as early as the 1970s the importance of human factors including human error and organizational failure has received much attention internationally leading to the establishment of the well known international convention on standards of training certification and watchkeeping for seafarers stcw convention and the international convention for safety of life at sea solas which provides a set of detailed guidelines for staff working on board a ship apart from imo there are many other international organizations such as international labour organization ilo and the international association of ship classification societies iacs which show great concern about the safety of the operations during shipping under the framework of international conventions regulations and codes the national rules are harmonized to reinforce the effectiveness of the performance kristiansen 2008 although enormous endeavours are devoted to regulated human factors involved in marine operations at the international and national levels the occurrence frequency of human errors in marine accidents is still not satisfactory compared against the desired level gaonkar et al 2011 noroozi et al 2014 however it can be concluded that the introduction of various efforts to address human behaviours were effective at reducing the occurrence of maritime accidents considering the collision accidents associated with aframax tankers 2 2 aframax tankers are optimal for short to medium haul crude oil transportation aframax class tankers are largely used in the basins of the black sea the north sea the caribbean sea the south and east china seas and the mediterranean as an example as is shown in fig 1 eliopoulou and papanikolaou 2016 the decreasing trend can be identified with the development or revision of the regulations safety guidelines and codes 1 1 related work the large influence of human factors on maritime accidents has prompted an increase in this field over past decades the influence mechanism of human factors in the marine safety management process was analysed qualitatively by er and celik 2005 later a model based on human reliability assessment hra was established to analyse maritime accidents that occurred under greek purviews tzannatos and kokotos 2009 based on the consensus that the role of human factors is a central issue in accidents at sea hetherington et al 2006 chauvin 2011 many studies were performed to investigate the human factors that caused directly the occurrences of maritime accidents a maib report maib 2004 indicated that the most common contributing human factors were poor lookout for 65 of the vessels and poor use of radar 73 based on the analysis of 33 accidents at sea during the period of 1994 2003 in contrast perrow 1999 pointed out that difficulties in coordination were the main human factors that led to accidents at sea shortly afterward after analysing 59 accidents at sea pourzanjani 2001 observed that 46 duty officers had not clearly indicated their intention to manoeuvre and the reason for this omission is explored further by chauvin and lardjane 2008 who pointing out that the existence of different systems could be the potential cause for this failure except for the human errors mentioned above there are many other key factors that have contributed to accidents at sea according to the existing studies such as improper manning lack of competency inter ship communications and so on these studies yielded interesting and meaningful findings to some extent however they often paid much attention to some of these human errors and failed to provide a systematic analysis framework for the accidents at sea furthermore the relationships among different potential human errors were not presented in these studies which limits their applicability to solving practical engineering issues caused by human factors usually the evaluation of human factors involved in maritime accidents is obviously difficult due to the lack of data associated with human factors from the shipping industry therefore the analysis of human factors must address the uncertainty and fuzziness of the collected data currently a variety of evaluation methodologies have been introduced by safety scholars and practitioners these methodologies can be categorized into two main branches empirical techniques and expert judgement the former puts much more emphasis on the collection of data about human factors for example swain and guttmann 1983 established a large human reliability database in which the data stemming from the literature interviews and personnel experience were used to evaluate human factors additionally the shipping accidents data from 2000 to 2012 worldwide were collected by eleftheria et al 2016 to analyse the human errors involved in them expert judgement is being given increased attention due to excellent performance in addressing the complexity and uncertainty of human factor data the well known formal safety assessment fsa recommended by imo is widely used in the shipping industry to analyse human factors eleftheria et al 2016 according to the principle of fsa martins and matuna 2010 investigated the human failures that contribute to the collision and grounding of tankers by a quantitative approach later a comprehensive model was established by xi and guo 2011 to reveal the relationships among human errors and behaviour in the shipping industry then the cream model developed by hollnagel 1998 was introduced by yang and wang 2012 to explore the solution for marine accident prevention at the same time the hfacs was applied to analyse collisions at sea chauvin et al 2013 zhang 2019 to improve the performance of hfacs the cognitive map cm approach was integrated into hfacs forming the hfacs cm model to evaluate human factors that emerged in marine accidents akyuz and celik 2014 furthermore akyuz et al 2016 defined error producing conditions epcs including hfacs heart and analytic hierarchy process ahp to predict human errors that appeared in the shipping industry in addition the fuzzy bayesian network bn also received much attention in human factors analysis in marine accidents ung 2019 baksh 2019 based on the above observations we can conclude that the application of expert judgement and artificial intelligence would result in a tendency to address the uncertainty that is a characteristic of human factors the methodologies based on artificial intelligence are found useful and promising in modelling and solving nonlinear functional relationships for complex systems artificial neural networks anns are utilized in various fields especially for the cases of solving nonlinear singular problems involved in multi disciplinary areas raja et al 2018a ahmad et al 2019 such as astrophysics plasma physics atomic physics thermodynamics electromagnetic nanotechnology fluid mechanics electrohydrodynamic signal processing economic and finance etc sabir et al 2018 with outstanding performance for solving nonlinear issues the anns can deal with extensive uncertainties and dynamics associated with human factor analysis which cannot be effectively solved by traditional methodologies in addition raja et al 2018b proved that the anns can effectively solve a variety dynamical problems taking the nonlinear heat conduction model as an example coincidentally various dynamical relationships are involved in the causal system for the maritime accidents which are becoming an interesting topic for the accident investigators the bayesian networks bns have been proven as a practical approach for complex nonlinear system however the nonlinear dependencies among variables cannot be solved effectively by bns sarbayev et al 2019 while the ann based models are able to deal with nonlinear relationships among variables 1 2 innovative contribution the objective of the present study is to develop a comprehensive model integrated by hfacs fta fuzzy ahp as well as ann which is capable of resolving the uncertainty in the human factors involved in collisions at sea collisions at sea accident data in chinese waters were collected in this study to verify the proposed methodology a group of experts with navigation experience in chinese waters from the shipping industry and academia were employed as consultants during this research more specifically the present study is characterized by mapping the ft into ann under the framework of hfacs in which the processes of digitalization and data mining are applied to establish causal relationships by both machine learning and pattern recognition the proposed methodology in this study

newly available data 1 3 organization the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the overview of the research methodology the employed techniques and the data collection the model establishment process is presented in section 3 sections 4 and 5 present our discussion and conclusions 2 methodology and data collection the overview of the methodology proposed in this study is illustrated in fig 2 in which the integration of hfacs fta huzzy ahp and ann leads to the formation of a comprehensive model to analyse the human factors involved in collisions at sea as shown in fig 2 there is a total of 4 parts of this study part 1 hierarchical the structure of the human factors is obtained based on the hfacs framework part 2 modelling the fault tree is developed according to the hierarchical structure designed in step 1 part 3 fuzzy ahp is employed to calculate the failure probability of basic events and top events in the ft part 4 map this step maps the ft into an ann 2 1 fuzzy theory usually there are three main approaches to addressing the failure probability statistical methods extrapolation and expert judgement preyssl 1995 in this study the expert judgement approach is chosen as a scientific consensus technique to weight the identified human factors that are involved in the collisions at sea and to rank the expert capability however since experts tend to express their opinions on each event based on their individual knowledge purpose and intellectual characteristics ford and sterman 1998 different analysis models have been established such as fuzzy priority relations game theory the max min delphi method and the similarity aggregation method sam it is difficult to identify a technique that is superior to the others for aggregating expert opinions liu et al 2014 however it is widely accepted that ambiguous expression from experts is extremely common thus the integration of fuzzy set theory and the ahp is frequently utilized to aggregate the experts ambiguity since van laarhoven and pedrycz 1983 fuzzy set theory has been introduced to ahp because the experts are more inclined to give fuzzy judgements than crisp expressions wang et al 2008 according to fuzzy set theory a fuzzy number chang 1996 can be defined such that m f r can be called a fuzzy number if we have the following 1 μ m x 0 1 x 0 r a α x μ a α x a α 0 1 where f r represents all fuzzy sets r is the set of real numbers and μ is the membership function practically speaking triangular and trapezoidal fuzzy numbers can be regarded as alternatives and which one is more suitable depends on the detailed situation based on the definition of the aforementioned fuzzy number we can define a fuzzy number m on r as a triangular fuzzy number if its membership function μ m x r 0 1 is equal to the following 2 μ m x x a 2 a 1 a 1 a 2 a 1 x a 1 a 2 a 3 a 3 a 2 x a 2 a 1 x a 2 a 3 0 o t h e r w i s e where a 1 a 2 a 3 a 1 and a 3 represent the lower and upper values of m respectively and a 2 represents the modal value in this way a triangular fuzzy number can be denoted as m a 1 a 2 a 3 in fact m is a non fuzzy number if a 1 a 2 a 3 similarly the membership function of a trapezoidal fuzzy number n a 1 a 2 a 3 a 4 can be derived as follows 3 μ n x x a 2 a 1 a 1 a 2 a 1 x a 1 a 2 1 x a 2 a 3 a 4 a 4 a 3 x a 4 a 3 x a 3 a 4 0 o t h e r w i s e considering two different triangular fuzzy numbers m 1 and m 2 m 1 a 1 a 2 a 3 and m 2 b 1 b 2 b 3 the following operational laws can be observed 4 m 1 m 2 a 1 a 2 a 3 b 1 b 2 b 3 a 1 b 1 a 2 b 2 a 3 b 3 5 m 1 m 2 a 1 a 2 a 3 b 1 b 2 b 3 a 1 b 1 a 2 b 2 a 3 b 3 6 λ m 1 λ a 1 a 2 a 3 λ a 1 λ a 2 λ a 3 λ 0 λ r 7 m 1 1 a 1 a 2 a 3 1 1 a 1 1 a 2 1 a 3 the linguistic expression of experts is critically valuable to handling complex circumstances and obtaining meaningful conclusions however the linguistic expression can be various and highly ambiguous therefore the relationships developed between the ambiguous expression of experts and the corresponding fuzzy numbers are extremely significant several attempts have been made to convert the ambiguous linguistic expressions into their corresponding fuzzy numbers i e miller 1956 nicolis 1985 and chen and hwang 1992 currently the approach established by chen and hwang 1992 is widely accepted as shown in table 1 as is shown in table 1 the verbal expressions associated with the aimed events are represented in eight scales from scale one which contains two verbal terms medium and high to scale eight which contains thirteen verbal terms from none to excellent based on the studies by nicolis 1985 ramzali et al 2015 proposed that the estimation of human memory aptitude is seven terms plus or minus two patches which indicates that the appropriate number of verbal terms is between five and nine terms for human factor identification issues implemented via expert judgement methodology 2 2 optimized hfacs framework the initial hfacs stems from the swiss cheese model which emphasizes the organizational dimension of accident causation reason 1990 it consists of four layers unsafe acts preconditions for unsafe acts unsafe supervision and organizational factors which were proposed by shappell and wiegmann 2000 later reinach and viale 2006 suggested that the accident causation should be extended beyond the organization such as to the economy law and policy which can be regarded as a supplement in the hfacs called the fifth layer based on the five layers of hfacs the human and organizational factors involved in marine accidents were analysed by chauvin et al 2013 in addition the modified hfacs framework with five layers has been widely applied to classify and identify accident causation associated with human factors based on accident reports for the applications of the hfacs framework to specific cases it is noted that the human factors on each layer are interpreted in specific situations which indicates that the factors on each layer could continuously change according to the investigation tasks in the present study an hfacs based collisions at sea risk analysis model is developed to identify and classify the human factors that are involved in collisions the proposed model consists of five layers and 15 categories which is illustrated in fig 3 obviously this model is established as a five level framework and it is similar to hfacs coll chauvin et al 2013 hfacs grounding chen et al 2013 and hfacs mam mazaheri et al 2015 however it should be pointed out that the proposed hfacs model includes a special layer called a hazard situation which is regarded as a supplement to the standard hfacs framework actually the introduction of a hazard situation is aimed at facilitating the modelling process of the fault tree which will be discussed further next in section 2 3 2 3 fault tree analysis fta is a widely used technique to estimate the safety and reliability of safety critical systems such as ship grounding accident causation analysis kum and sahin 2015 explosions in oil tankers wang et al 2013 and lng carrier accident analysis zhou et al 2017 within the framework of fta the failure probability of the system can be decomposed into different types of failures and further into failure causes until it enters the category of elementary failure causes which cannot be decomposed any more the typical ft is usually presented as a directed acyclic graph which consists of the following components top event te the root of the ft which is usually decomposed into a series of different events also called the top level event tle basic events bes bes are the leaves of the acyclic graph which cannot be decomposed any more intermediate events ie ies are represented by a combination of bes and other ies through the logic gates mentioned above and they are critical in illustrating the process of system failure evolution especially those ies that decompose into bes gates gates usually refers to boolean connectors the and and or are used most frequently which is utilized to specify how the failures of the children combine to cause the failures of systems in the ft model the failure probability of te could be computed through the failure probabilities distribution of the bes during which the logical relationships established among the bes and ies would be critical according to mathematical logic theory the logical relationships that emerge in the ft the or and and gates can be calculated by the formulas shown in eqs 8 and 9 respectively as follows 8 φ x i 1 n x i x 1 x 2 x 3 x n 9 ψ x i 1 n x i x 1 x 2 x 3 x n where φ x and ψ x are the tes that describe the state of the complex system and x i denotes the i t h basic contributing factors namely the bes the output φ x represented by the or gate appears under the condition of at least one input factor while the output ψ x represented by the and gate occurs under the condition of having two input factors lee et al 1985 in the present study the elements including te ies and bes involved in the ft can be transformed from the aforementioned hfacs framework and the transforming process is illustrated in fig 4 the human factors that cause the occurrences of collisions at sea identified from level 1 to level 5 under the framework of hfacs are mapped into the structure of the ft as basic events at the same time the collisions at sea in the hfacs framework correspond to the top events in the ft model the hazard situations identified would be transferred into intermediate events in the ft which is the reason why a layer of hazard situations is introduced into the proposed hfacs framework in this study 2 4 artificial neural network with the development of computational tools anns are created gradually and they have been widely applied as computational techniques for modelling and forecasting in various fields chitsazan et al 2015 compared with the bn anns have a distinct advantage of modelling the correlation between the input variables while bn assumes that all of the elementary events are independent sarbayev et al 2019 usually the ann is characterized by having the capacity to detect nonlinear relationships among the inputs and outputs of a system with no need for detailed information or data on the physical systems which is suitable for those systems with high uncertainty the interconnected neurons in the ann are organized as a layered structure in other words the output of each neuron from the sub layer is one of the inputs to each neuron of the next layer with which the transfer function is used on the input signal of each neuron illias et al 2015 in a developed ann model the networks can learn from known examples and subsequently identify functional relationships among the data when the original relationships are unknown ashtiani and shahsavari 2016 therefore the capacity of an ann is evaluated by the selection of training data sets and the network architecture seifeddine et al 2012 2 4 1 algorithm for ann the principle of the proposed methodology of ann based model is presented in fig 5 all the neurons are allocated at input layer hidden layer and the output layer the input neurons form the input vector x x 1 x 2 x i x n a weight vector is formed by weights leading from the preceding layer to the exist layer denoted as w j w 1 j w i j w n j where w i j represents the connection weight from the i th node in the preceding layer to the j th node in the existing layer in addition θ θ 0 θ 1 θ j is defined as the bias vector of the proposed ann where θ 0 is the bias from the last hidden layer to the output layer and j indicates the number of hidden layers after the input vector and the initiation values for weights and bias are given the prediction values will be obtained from the output layer by the feedforward ann which is represented by the following chitsazan et al 2015 10 y j k f 1 θ j i w i j i i k 11 y k θ 0 j w j y j k where y j k is the output value of the j th neuron of the hidden layer y k is the k th predicted value k represents the number of neurons at the output layer i i k denotes the i th input for the k th input vector f 1 is the transfer function also known as activation function which is the sigmoid function in the present study 12 f 1 t 1 1 e t for the purpose of network learning the back propagation algorithm is adopted to error computations and updating all the weights and biases the levenberg marquardt l m algorithm is applied in this study for updating weights and biases to minimize the error the mathematical expression is given as 13 x k 1 x k j t j μ i 1 j t e where j t is the jacobian of the performance function for weights and biases e represents the error vector of the proposed network i is the identity matrix and μ denotes the scalar value to ensure decrease continuously of the value of performance function the abovementioned process will be repeated continuously to optimize network s performance until the calculated error satisfies the pre defined goal tolerance requirement basheer and hajmeer 2000 among the lists of methods utilized to minimize the overall error the mean squared error mse is preferred and is widely used sarbayev et al 2019 the function for the mse is expressed as follows 14 m s e 1 n m 1 n y 0 y p r e 2 where y 0 is the observed network output and y p r e is the predicted output of the network 2 4 2 configuration of ann parameters selecting a suitable configuration and suitable parameters for the designed ann is important for the topic to be studied in most cases more than one hidden layer is embedded in the artificial neutral network which is determined by the modelling requirements for a limited case a model without the hidden layers can only be capable of representing linearly separable functions or decisions an artificial neutral network with three or more hidden layers has been proved to be less practicable due to its complexity and long training time without a sufficient increase in its efficiency heaton 2017 karsoliya 2012 in practice the artificial neutral network with two hidden layers has been widely utilized for the issues to be solved in addition to the number of hidden layers the number of neurons in each hidden layer could also make a considerable difference toward the performance of the whole network an inappropriate number of neurons at each hidden layer would lead to the occurrence of over fitting or under fitting problems to solve this problem many rule of thumb methods have been proposed to determine the appropriate number of neurons assigned at each hidden layer the following rules are selected for the present study which are proposed with reference to panchal and panchal 2017 and sarbayev et al 2019 from the practice of perspective these rules will be tested and validated in section 4 4 in the present study 1 the total number of neurons assigned at all hidden layers should not exceed the number of neurons in the input layer 2 the total number of neurons in all hidden layers should be the sum of 2 3 neurons in the input layers and the neurons in the output layer 3 if the second rule is not practicable it is recommended that the number of neurons in the first hidden layer should be the number of ies directly connected with bes in the ft 4 following the third rule the number of neurons in the second hidden layer should be the number of ies in the ft minus the number of ies directly connected with the bes 2 5 data collection a data base associated with maritime accidents must be established to illustrate the developed methodology according to the annual report of maritime accidents in china from 2015 to 2018 maritime accidents associated with sand carriers operating in the domestic waters in china have gained considerable attention due to enormous loss of life and property in the present study maritime accidents associated with sand carriers occurring in china in 2018 are selected as the database 38 accidents totally it should be noted that only the accident causations mentioned in the accident reports and obtained from the accident investigators are considered and processed based on the analysis model proposed in this study 3 model establishment the implementation for the proposed model is illustrated in fig 6 including the graphical mapping algorithm and the modelling rules the main steps and roles are described in detail below 3 1 hfacs analysis for sand carrier accidents 3 1 1 description of the proposed hfacs in this section the detailed information for the hfacs model of sand carrier accidents is described based on the framework proposed in section 2 2 the five different levels for the human risk factors involved in sand carrier accidents are denoted by r1 r5 in the following content if there is no special instruction the detailed information for each level is shown in table 2 3 1 2 classification and hierarchical structure of the identified human risk factors in this section the human risk factors that cause the occurrence of sand carrier accidents are analysed and classified according to the knowledge of experts in this way the hierarchical structure of the identified risk factors is established which facilitates the embedment of these risk factors into the ft model the expert judgement method has been widely adopted in different fields including risk analysis accident investigation decision examination and so on in most situations expert elicitation is applied to accumulated specialist opinions about a subject when available resources are lacking or limited by physical circumstances yazdi et al 2017 thus expert competence is critically significant for scientific conclusions the selection of capable experts can be established according to the following criteria compared with a homogenous group of experts a heterogeneous group is usually preferred in a heterogeneous group the individual experience of each expert receives considerable attention which enables the consideration of all possible specialist opinions from various viewpoints yazdi et al 2017 with respect to the education and experience of the experts in a field the longer they have focused on a subject academic or practical subject the more accurate their intuitionistic judgement is with respect to expert familiarity with a subject especially through practical experience an experienced specialist can master every detail of the subject in the present study according to the aforementioned selection principle a heterogeneous group of experts was selected for calculating the impact rate of human errors involved in the marine accident scenario and five experts were employed to judge the human factors the weight of each expert was evaluated based on their background and expertise celik et al 2010 lavasani et al 2015 specifically the following four aspects were considered professional position educational level job experience and age miri lavasani et al 2011 omidvari et al 2014 additionally considering the particularity of the marine shipping industry the competency level of the selected experts was also included therefore a total of five aspects are used for evaluating the expert capability as shown in fig 7 as mentioned earlier five experts were employed to give their opinions on the human errors that underlie marine accidents to improve the heterogeneity of the expert group the experts in this study represent different fields associated with marine shipping including a marine safety supervisor marine safety senior scholar experienced marine engineer officer marine engineering specialist and navigation specialist all of them have seafaring experience except for the senior scholar whose focus of study is safety evaluation in marine transportation one of the experts currently works as a senior marine accident investigator and holds a master s degree and senior captain competency certificate all of the relevant information of the five experts is summarized in detail in table 3 official accident reports are essential for risk factor analysis they present valuable and detailed information about the accident mazaheri et al 2015 therefore as the first step the accident s contributory factors mentioned in the official accident reports are considered and listed considering the limitation of the accident database employed in the present study we interviewed some shipping companies that were operating sand carriers in coastal areas and seafarers who had experience working on the sand carriers in addition a literature review is a useful approach for us to identify the risk factors associated with ship accidents in the coastal area chauvin et al 2013 in this way even if we do not have a sufficient number of accident reports we still will not miss the risk factors that lead to the occurrence of sand carrier accidents finally the risk factors that stem from accident reports interviews and literature reviews are identified in table 4 in the second step the risk factors identified aforementioned would be classified based on the hfacs model illustrated in section 2 2 the classification process is implemented with the assistance of four experts who have industry experience or research experience as with the sand carrier in coastal areas all of the risk factors would be classified according to the five risk levels described in the hfacs model namely unsafe acts preconditions for unsafe acts unsafe supervision organizational factors and external factors the classification results would be adopted in cases where at least three experts judgements are consistent otherwise the classification results would be discussed face to face among the employed experts until consistent judgements are obtained as the last step the hierarchical structure of the risk factors is established based on the classification results under the framework of the hfacs model as shown in fig 8 3 1 3 statistical analysis there is no doubt that every ship accident is caused by many different risk factors and the cause of each accident almost always varies from the others according to zhang 2019 and chen et al 2013 the proposed statistical analysis procedure in the present study consists of two parts namely the occurrence frequency analysis of the risk factors and the cause consequence analysis occurrence frequency analysis of risk factors the risk factors that contribute to the sand carrier accidents are analysed statistically one by one according to the accident reports about the 38 sand carrier accidents the results of the statistical analysis are presented in fig 9 according to fig 9 it can be found that r2 2 incompetent crew r3 2 lack of situational awareness and r2 5 inappropriate emergency operation are ranked as the top three most frequency human risk factors which have presented at more than 8 sand carrier accidents it should be noted that some human risk factors are not mentioned in the accident reports such as r2 10 poor communication and r3 4 lack of navigation publication but they are indeed the human risk factors that contribute to sand carrier accidents according to the expert judgement and literature review described in section 3 1 2 even if there are different occurrence frequencies all of the human risk factors identified in the present study would cause sand carrier accidents which is the basis for the ft modelling in the following section cause consequence analysis the consequences caused by the identified human risk factors namely hazardous situations would be elaborated and defined in this section based on expert judgement and discussion meetings the process and results of the cause consequence analysis are presented in fig 10 which is another basis for the establishment of the ft model in the following section fig 10 shows the memberships between the human risk factors identified in section 3 1 2 called basic events in the ft model and the hazardous situation ranking from e1 to e10 which is part of the intermediate events in the ft model all of the intermediate events connect to the top event and the basic events are presented in table 5 according to the human risk factors analysis principal proposed in this study the intermediate events involved in the sand carrier accidents are composed of two groups namely primary intermediate events and senior intermediate events specifically the primary intermediate events itemized as e1 e2 e3 e10 are characterized as the intermediate events directed by the basic events while the senior intermediate events itemized as m1 m2 m6 are defined as the intermediate events that connect the top events and the primary intermediate events 3 2 fault tree modelling based on hfacs the ft model for the sand carrier accidents would be established on the basis of the proposed statistical analysis procedure mentioned above and the developed hierarchical structure of the risk factors there are various human risk factors that can lead to the occurrence of sand carrier accidents which are defined as basic events under the framework of ft then the causality and consequence among these accident risk factors are analysed based on the hazard situations and events according to the statistical analysis results shown in fig 10 where the hazardous situation would be acted on as the primary intermediate events in the ft in other words the basic events will direct to these hazardous situations as is shown in fig 10 subsequently the preliminary fault tree is developed as a supplement the experts knowledge and existing research are utilized to improve the ft by replenishing some of the human risk factors that are not presented in the sand carrier accident reports finally the ft model is developed as shown in fig 11 in the developed ft model the sand carrier accident is defined as the top event which is contributed to by a series of intermediate events most of them are the hazardous situations defined in fig 10 the human risk factors classified under the framework of hfacs are denoted as the basic events in the ft the human risk factors can be aggregated as two groups namely operational faults and lack of effective supervision and from the perspective of causal logical principles they are defined as senior intermediate events which connect the primary intermediate events and the top event in the ft here the description for all of the symbols presented in the ft can be referred to in table 5 3 3 expert elicitation and aggregation of data to address any cognitive biases that are presented by individual expert viewpoints it is vital to aggregate expert opinions first expert capabilities must be weighted and scored and the indicators for these expert capabilities can vary according to specific scenario details such as professional position experience education and so on before evaluating an expert s capabilities his her score rating is developed then pairwise comparison matrices are established according to a particular expert s details about the scores of their capabilities indicator these matrices can be further processed as follows until the weight of the individual expert is calculated buckley 1985 with respect to fuzzy numbers in pairwise comparison matrices the geometric mean technique is applied to obtain the synthetic pairwise comparison matrix b b i j as follows 15 b i j a 1 i j a 2 i j a k i j 1 4 where a k a k i j is the pairwise comparison matrix of the k t h indicator for the expert capability evaluation the fuzzy weights of the criteria for each expert can be calculated by the following 16 r i b i 1 b i 2 b i n 1 n where the fuzzy weight of the i t h expert is indicated by r i the fuzzy weights for each criterion are defined as follows 17 w i r i r 1 r 2 r n 1 where w i l w i m w i u w i denotes the fuzzy weight of the i t h criterion in which l w i m w i u w i indicate the lower middle and upper values of the fuzzy weights of the i t h criterion respectively the weight of each expert is computed by employing the centre of area technique namely as follows 18 p e i 1 3 u w i l w i m w i l w i l w i suppose that every expert e i i 1 2 3 n states his or her specific viewpoint about a certain feature by using a predefined set of linguistic variables these linguistic expressions can then be converted into their corresponding triangular or trapezoidal fuzzy numbers which can be processed as follows until defuzzification is achieved 1 calculation of the degree of similarity s u v e u e v is defined as the degree of agreement for different opinions between each pair of experts suppose that e u a 1 a 2 a 3 and e v b 1 b 2 b 3 are represented as two standard triangular fuzzy numbers u v then the degree of agreement between e u and e v can be obtained by the following 19 s u v e u e v 1 1 j i 1 j a i b i i 1 2 3 where j is the number of fuzzy set members e g j 3 is for standard triangular fuzzy numbers and j 4 for standard trapezoidal fuzzy numbers additionally the greater the values of s u v e u e v are the better the similarity between expert e u and e v 2 calculation for the average of agreement aa degree for each expert viewpoint 20 a a e u 1 u 1 u v v 1 u s u v e u e v where u is the total number of experts 3 calculation for the relative agreement ra degree between two types of experts the value of r a e u for the u t h expert can be obtained by the following 21 r a e u a a e u u 1 u a a e u 4 estimation of the consensus coefficient cc for each expert the value of c c e u for the u t h expert can be obtained by the following 22 c c e u β p e u 1 β r a e u where the coefficient β 0 β 1 is introduced to represent the importance of p e u over r a e u namely the greater the value of β is the greater the importance of p e u actually when β 0 there is no weight is distributed to p e u which indicates that a homogenous group of experts is employed another limit case β 1 indicates that the consensus degree among the various experts viewpoints is adequately high 5 calculation for the aggregated results of the experts viewpoints the aggregated results denoted by r a can be computed by the following 23 r a c c e 1 e 1 c c e 2 e 2 c c e u e u 6 defuzzification of the aggregated results the defuzzification of the fuzzy numbers is critically important for the application of fuzzy set theory the method of center of area coa is widely used for the defuzzification operation which is expressed as follows 24 x μ m x x d x μ m x d x where x represents the defuzzification result and μ m x indicates the aggregated membership functions defined in 2 and 3 for fuzzy triangular and trapezoidal numbers respectively therefore the fuzzy numbers of the aggregated results denoted as r a c 1 c 2 c 3 for fuzzy triangular numbers or r a c 1 c 2 c 3 c 4 for fuzzy trapezoidal numbers can be defuzzified by 25 and 26 respectively as follows 25 r a c 1 c 2 x c 2 c 2 c 1 x d x c 2 c 3 c 3 x c 3 c 2 x d x c 1 c 2 x c 2 c 2 c 1 d x c 2 c 3 c 3 x c 3 c 2 d x c 1 c 2 c 3 3 26 r a c 1 c 2 x c 1 c 2 c 1 x d x c 2 c 3 x d x c 3 c 4 c 4 x c 4 c 3 x d x c 1 c 2 x c 1 c 2 c 1 d x c 2 c 3 d x c 3 c 4 c 4 x c 4 c 3 d x 1 3 c 4 c 3 2 c 2 c 1 2 c 4 c 3 c 1 c 2 c 4 c 3 c 2 c 1 3 4 mapping the fta into the ann 3 4 1 probability calculation of basic events in the fta the probabilities of basic events are calculated by expert consultation as mentioned in section 3 1 2 five experts with different backgrounds are employed in the present study the rating criteria in table 6 are used to score the capability of every expert in the heterogeneous group every indicator is scaled from one to five except for the age term because age is less important than the other indicators herein the higher the score is the more important the expert is considered to be according to the evidence presented in table 3 the weight of each expert is different therefore based on the facts shown in table 3 the capability of each expert is first scored according to the rating criteria presented in table 6 then the pairwise comparison matrices are calculated finally the weight of each expert is calculated by utilizing formulas 15 18 as summarized in table 7 information concerning expert opinions for the failure rate of linguistic expressions is given in appendix a all of the experts employed in this study are given equal input in the group decision making process and are independent from each other the similarity aggregation method sam is applied to aggregate the expert opinions presented in appendix a including the important allocation of an appropriate value of β indicating the importance of the experts hsu and chen 1996 however yazdi et al 2017 showed that the value of β was not sensitive during fuzzy multiple attribute decision making in an aircraft landing system and β 0 5 was considered to be the optimal value therefore in this study β was assigned a value of 0 5 to balance the importance of the expert weights and the consensus degree of the different expert opinions following the calculation principle presented in section 3 3 every human factor can be aggregated as a trapezoidal fuzzy number by 17 21 followed by a defuzzification process utilizing 22 and 24 the results for the aggregation of the experts opinions and defuzzification are represented in table 8 to convert the impact rate of the human factors crisp failure probability into a failure probability the approach proposed by onisawa 1990 was employed to develop the functional relationship between the fp of the human factors and the cfp presented in table 8 3 4 2 data acquisition in this section data for the development of the ann is collected and generated as mentioned above in 2 4 the larger the amount of data that is collected the better the performance of the established ann model however in the present study the database that contains 38 sand carrier accidents fails to satisfy the requirement of an excellent ann model therefore a random probability generation function is necessary due to the unavailability of actual site data which is proposed by sarbayev et al 2019 under the assumption of normal distributions a set of 500 random probabilities are generated for each basic event illustrated in fig 9 during which the means and standard deviations of the given normal distributions are the probabilities listed in tables 8 and 15 respectively matlab r2017b was employed to generate the required data for the training and test of the ann in other words the function randn embedded in matlab was applied in the computational code for the established fault tree to generate 500 samples of be failure probabilities as with the probabilities of te they can be calculated according to the methodology proposed by ozkan et al 2013 based on the main principle of calculation described in section 2 3 finally the data samples for the training and testing of the ann were obtained in the present study 3 4 3 ann establishment based on the ft structure in fig 11 the proposed ann in the present study was established as in fig 12 and the structure of the ann for sand carrier accidents analysis was developed according to the graphical mapping algorithm fig 4 computation process fig 6 and mapping rules proposed in section 2 3 for the established ann shown in fig 13 all of the generated 500 sets of data were divided into two groups 450 sets were dedicated to be the training data and 50 sets of data were for the testing of the proposed ann model all of the basic events be1 be2 be24 were treated as the neurons in the input layer of the ann while the top event was regarded as the neuron at the output layer of the ann according to the typical rule of thumb a feedforward backpropagation type artificial network with two hidden layers was employed to address the issues in the present study according to the principles described in section 2 4 the proposed ann parameters are listed as follows i ten neurons were included in the first hidden layer while six neurons were in the second hidden layer ii the initiation values for weights and biases are generated by xavier initialization method iii the 24 bes obtained from fta are set as the neurons at the input layer and the failure probabilities of bes form the input vector for the network iv the function of levenberg marquardt backpropagation defined as tainlm in matlab r2017b was selected as the training function v the performance function for the ann model was set to mse vi the transfer functions were selected as the logsig for the neurons in the first and second hidden layers and linear for the output layer vii the training process would cease when the subset error rate increased for more than ten epoch iterations in a row 4 results and discussion 4 1 performance check for the proposed ann the performance check was implemented by comparing the results obtained from fta and the proposed ann which is based on the fifty data samples generated by matlab as mentioned above for testing purposes as the first step the fta would be applied to the fifty data samples as the input data to calculate the probabilities for the top event in the fault tree then the fifty data samples regarded as different bes would be treated as the input neurons of the proposed ann one by one and the corresponding probabilities of the top event as the output neuron were predicted through running the computational code the resulting differences between the fta and ann were presented in fig 13 based on the differences shown in fig 13 it is obviously found that the maximum value of the differences between ann and fta is 0 01053 and the mean value of the differences is derived as 0 00508 in addition according to the equation 14 in section 2 4 the mean squared error mse is calculated as 3 831e 5 which indicates satisfied matches between the two models the potential application of models based on ann in the maritime risk evaluation is to be explored for different cases 4 2 the advantage of the combination of the ann and the fta the ann based models are trained utilizing the database by adjusting the values of the synaptic weights and biases in the network which results in the development of mathematical relationships between the input and output variables from the perspective of running principles the ann based model could be established without the development of the ft however the identification of the input variables of the ann based model could be challenging in risk analysis or accident analysis especially for complex systems at the same time the fault tree has been proven to be an effective approach to analyse casualty causing accidents or risks therefore it is more beneficial to apply fta to identify the basic events that cause the occurrence of risk or accidents which are selected as the input variables for the ann based model the structure of fault tree may be different for various maritime accident scenario or different types of accidents e g the number of bes is changeable and the influence on the performance of the proposed ann based model is studied with the assumption of 22 bes deleting r2 1 and r1 5 all of the mapping process is the same as described above including the same algorithm hidden layer structure data generation process but the change of the number of neurons on input layer from 24 to 22 after computation the maximum and mean values of differences were 0 0138 and 0 00496 respectively then 2 new bes were added with new dataset for 50 failure probabilities the parameters of the newly developed ann were adopted as those of in the present ann while the parameters for the newly added neurons were set as default values the maximum and mean values of differences were 0 01098 and 0 00145 respectively however in case of training the same ann without adoption of the present parameters namely all the parameters of new ann were set as the default values the maximum and mean values of differences were 0 01314 and 0 00405 respectively the results show that it can be beneficial for the newly developed ann to adopt the parameters of the existing ann in the case of changing the structure of fault tree 4 3 the effect of new availability of data to the developed ann considering the practice some more new data could become available thereby it is necessary to consider whether the established ann model should be updated to re evaluate the failure probability of the top event in the fault tree therefore this situation was simulated in the present study by introducing other sets of new training samples as newly available data in this study 200 new training samples would put into the database by 50 training samples one time e g the proposed ann based model will run 4 times during the implementation of the experiments the parameters of the ann referring to connections and biases would be updated continuously by transferring the existing parameters to the new experiment the results regarding the all 4 experiments were illustrated in table 9 the first group results for no new data is set as 450 training samples in the database as mentioned above it is obviously found that both the maximum and mean values of differences are decreasing continuously with the addition of new available data into the database which indicates that the performance of the proposed ann based model was improved by the availability of the new data for the failure analysis 4 4 the effect of different numbers of hidden neurons on the network performance for a proposed ann based model although the structure of the network would be designed according to some rules which can be described as in section 3 3 the performance of the model can still be affected by some factors it should be noted that the number of neurons in the hidden layers is presented as one of the important factors that could make some difference in the performance of the ann based model thus different numbers of neurons in the hidden layers were adopted for the training of the proposed ann based model using the same data set generated for bes and te in the present study the results for each case with a different combination of the numbers of neurons in the hidden layers are presented in table 9 which describes the mean and maximum differences between the outputs of the ann based model and the testing values of the failure probabilities of the te the results presented in table 10 illustrate that the ann based model that is composed of 10 and 6 neurons in the first and second hidden layers has better performance the effectiveness of the rule of thumb rules proposed in this paper is also validated according to the results presented in table 9 furthermore in addition to the architecture of the proposed ann based model the training data set volume could also influence the performance of the proposed model therefore to obtain optimized performance of the ann based model it is necessary to develop a well organized architecture for the model while collecting as much as data with good quality 5 conclusions the present study attempts to propose a comprehensive methodology for marine accident analysis associated with human factors by mapping the fuzzy ft into an ann ft has been validated as an effective risk assessment tool in accident analysis however the disadvantages of being static ignoring the interdependency among basic events and so on limit its application toward more complex and digitalized systems the ann is widely used as a data driven modelling technique to address complex non linear relationships among variables but it is critical and often difficult to define the input variables in the present study focusing on the human factors involved in the 38 coastal sand carrier accidents that occurred in china the risk factors are identified and classified into five levels under the framework of hfacs the risk factors on each level correspond to the basic events while the intermediate events correspond to the hazardous situations that derive from the identified risk factors and the top event corresponds to the occurrence of an accident based on the hierarchical structure of the developed ft the input and output variables of the proposed ann based model were well identified and in addition the number of neurons variables assigned in the first and second hidden layers could be confirmed the application of the proposed ann based model to coastal sand carrier accidents shows that the ann can perform well if the numbers of neurons in the hidden layers are defined based on the numbers of intermediate events in the ft the results also illustrate that the introduction of newly available data information aiming at optimizing training could improve the performance of the proposed ann based model and in addition the performance of this model can also be optimized by adjusting the architecture of the ann according to the present study overall the present study provides an integrated analysis framework and methodology to address the information involved in the coastal sand carrier accidents in china which can benefit to understand and predict the risk factors that cause the sand carrier accidents the proposed anns based methodology in the present study is an entirely data driven model in future the potential work will be devoted to improving the performance of the methodology by adding newly available data associated with maritime accidents which continuously updates the parameters of the proposed artificial networks in additions further research work associated with the present study is to develop practical application by standardizing of the evaluation process under the proposed model work associated with the abovementioned issues is under

22178,the rapid development of the offshore wind industry is leading stimulating interest in exploiting wind resources in deeper waters and farther offshore requiring alternative support structures including floating foundations currently a number of different concepts are under development aiming to become commercialised for deployment in the near future one of the main barriers against their widespread adoption is cost which is currently considerably higher than fixed support structures this paper investigates through a parametric study the total mass and cost of three floater concepts spar barge and semi submersible particularly focusing on the material and manufacturing costs the manufacturing cost was approached by means of manufacturing complexity factors whose values were obtained through a survey among experts in floating offshore wind key finding of this work under the defined conditions is the fact that semi sub structures with steel as structural material appeared to be the most expensive configuration spar costs decrease with higher draft values due to the reduction in the ballast mass while the barge solution is potentially the lowest cost alternative nevertheless risks and benefits of different configurations should also be considered alongside as they could lead to savings throughout the service life of the asset keywords floating wind turbines

density 1 introduction the eu has set ambitious targets for a total of 320 gw installed wind energy out of which 66 gw are expected to come from offshore wind ow energy ewea european wind energy association et al 2015 for this target to be achieved deep water locations must be explored this trend is highlighted in ioannou et al 2018a where wind farms in water depths exceeding 45 m and distance to shore of more than 110 km have already been developed moving yet further offshore also means that better wind resources can be exploited while at the same time limiting visual impact from land and away from competing with other users of the sea kaldellis et al 2016 leung and yang 2012 currently a number of concepts have been developed as summarised in james and ros 2015 leimeister et al 2018 mast e 2015 which are expected to be more suitable and economically viable in depths greater than 60 m the floaters for offshore wind must supply adequate buoyancy to support the weight of the wind turbine and to restrain the motions within acceptable limits butterfield et al 2007 the stabilization mechanisms are i ballast stabilised ii water plane or buoyancy stabilised and iii mooring stabilised in the first case a large ballast deep at the bottom of the floating structure moves the centre of gravity of the total system below the centre of buoyancy leading to a stabilising righting moment which counteracts rotational displacements in the second mechanism a large second moment of area with respect to the rotational axis creates a stabilising righting moment in case of rotational displacement finally mooring stabilised floaters have high tensioned mooring lines which generate the restoring moments when the structures are inclined based on the stabilization mechanisms floaters are generally classified as either a spar barge semi submersible or tension leg platform tlp floaters raise new challenges however also raise the prospect of developing offshore wind farms in a radically new way for example lumbreras and ramos 2013 reviewed the main developments in offshore wind turbine layout optimisation with a particular focus on the electrical design other authors have focused on alternative uses of electricity for non grid connected ngc floating wind ngc floating ow can address some key issues including the deep waters and lack of grid connection furthermore it can be used to take advantage of the far ow energy potential characterised by high winds and limited seasonal variations which would be prohibitively expensive to connect to the grid to this end innovative solutions presenting remarkable market potential have been explored by industry and academia at a conceptual level to exploit the untapped wind energy potential far offshore related activities that can be possibly performed for ngc wind farms include hydrogen production utilising water electrolysis integrated unit to produce ammonia aquaculture producing fish shellfish and sea weeds concepts for multi purpose platforms in deep waters have been investigated in the past by research projects such as the tropos project consortium of tropos project 2015 developing modular multi use platforms integrating several activities amongst which aquaculture production and renewable energy conversion h2ocean project huebscher and urbano 2015 developed a wind wave power open sea platform equipped for hydrogen generation the uk offshore wind industry has achieved a rapid reduction in the levelised cost of electricity lcoe attributed to the technology innovation maturing supply chain and higher capacity factors from the deployment of wind farms farther offshore although the capital costs including also development costs for offshore projects have increased between 2010 and 2016 by a weighted average of 4 peaking at around 2012 2013 due to costlier installations further offshore the impact of increasing costs was moderated by the better wind resource and turbine technology increasing the capacity factor of the wind farms operation and maintenance costs is a significant part of the project s lcoe comprising approximately 30 of total lcoe ioannou et al 2018b and initial full service contracts amounted to 10 7 23 kw year while their renewal costed 16 8 33 6 kw year following 5 years of operation between 2008 and 2017 irena 2018 there is large market potential for floating offshore wind however commercialization of the technology has not yet been realised depending on the growth of investments in this early stage of the technology towards promoting supply chain capability and gradual scaling up in project size future costs are predicted to range amounting 200 mwh in 2018 for demonstration projects to 85 mwh in 2027 for first commercial projects catapult offshore renewable energy 2018 the cost of floating support structures has a higher capex share than the fixed bottom s foundation indicatively the floating substructure of a reference wind power plant accounts for approximately 29 5 of the capex of the project as opposed to 13 5 for a fixed bottom reference project stehly et al 2018 depending on the floater type this value can be higher or lower and significantly influence the profitability of the project to this end focus should be put on the impact of key design parameters on the cost of the substructure this paper aims to investigate through a parametric study the impact of key design parameters of three typical floating concepts namely the spar barge and semi submersible on the total mass production and acquisition cost by performing a hydrostatic analysis for each concept this study will be particularly relevant for researchers and developers at the conceptual stage of the development of floating support structures as it performs a preliminary stability assessment cost analysis focusing on global design parameters for a detailed cost analysis of the different concepts higher fidelity breakdown of costs should take place at a conceptual stage however these details are often not present and hence higher level analysis is required the paper is organised as follows section 2 presents a literature review focusing particularly on parametric equations for floating wind turbines and cost modelling section 3 discusses the methodology employed for this analysis while section 4 presents results of the hydrostatic analysis and translation into production and acquisition cost of floating support structures section 5 presents a discussion on the results also providing a sensitivity analysis of key input parameters section 6 presents conclusions of this work and recommendations for future work 2 literature review a review of literature reveals a number of relevant publications al ramthan and aubeny 2018 studied the performance of suction caissons for floating offshore wind turbines under inclined survival loads to this end authors presented a parametric study in which the effects of inclined load angle cyclic amplitude and soil stiffness are evaluated kumawat et al 2019 investigated a semi submersible floating wind turbine combined with flap type wecs with a parametric

the platform main dimensions micallef et al 2017 studied the dynamic analysis of a floating hybrid spar tension leg platform concept for wind monitoring applications in deep sea carrying out a parametric analysis for different geometrical and met ocean conditions and the simulations were restricted to regular single frequency wave and constant wind speed conditions only hartmann et al 2017

of the tlp equipped with a 6 mw wind turbine rahmdel et al 2016 performed a parametric study of spar type floating offshore wind turbines fowts by numerical and experimental investigations lemmer né sandner et al 2016 reported a parametric wave disturbance model for an improved representation of the overall system dynamics of a floating wind turbine fowt si et al 2014 performed the modelling and optimisation of a passive structural control design for a spar type floating wind turbine providing parametric analysis and design basis for future improvement on floating wind turbine load reduction with structural control methods benassai et al 2014 studied the mooring control of tri floater support structures for wind turbines by means of a numerical parametric study both catenary and vertical tensioned mooring lines where are considered chen and yu 2013 present design requirements for floating offshore wind turbines where the relative importance of various design parameters and their impact on the development of design criteria are evaluated through parametric analyses finally jeon et al 2013 studied the sloshing characteristics of an annular cylindrical tuned liquid damper for spar type floating offshore wind turbine parametrically by experiment aiming at the exploration of its successful use for suppressing the structural vibration of spar type floating wind turbine subject to multidirectional wind wave and current excitations 3 methodology as this paper focuses on the conceptual design of floating support structures the analysis will be based on hydrostatic laws and basic cost modelling in this section a brief description of this theory is presented 3 1 hydrostatic analysis the hydrostatic analysis was carried out to verify that floaters provide enough buoyancy to support the weight of the turbine and to restrain pitch roll and heave motions within acceptable limits the hydrostatic laws in pitch for a spar semi submersible and barge floating wind platforms could be defined by the buoyancy equation eq 1a and the restoring equation eq 1b as follows 1a m t o t a l ρ w v 1b ρ w g i y f b z c b f w z c g sin θ f t h h u b f b z c b where m t o t a l is the total mass of the structure considering the turbine the support the ballast and the mooring system g is the gravity acceleration ρ w is the water density v is the volume of the displaced fluid i y is the second moment of area with respect to the y axis f b is the buoyancy force z c b is the centre of buoyancy the point through which the resultant of all buoyant forces on a body may be assumed to act f w is the weight force z c g is the centre of gravity the point where all the weights constituting the system may be assumed to act θ is the inclination angle f t is the thrust force h h u b is the height hub and f b is the free board fig 1 illustrates the applied forces and reference points of the structure the left hand side of eq 1b represents the stabilization mechanics where the first term corresponds to the water plane area stabilised whereas the second and third term corresponds to the ballast stabilised 3 2 cost analysis the cost analysis of floating wind turbines is associated with the calculation of all costs throughout the service life of the assets detailed studies distinguishing key cost components of fixed support structures have been reported in ioannou et al 2018a b ioannou et al 2017 the costs are broken down into capex opex and devex capex includes the capital costs during the development and consenting production and acquisition installation and commissioning phases of the project opex includes the cost during the operation and maintenance o m phase and devex the costs during the decommissioning and disposal phase in this study opex and devex have been considered equal across the different floating concepts and the same has been assumed for all capital costs except for the material and manufacturing costs which have been adapted to the specific configuration of the floaters as the scope of this paper is to perform a comparative analysis across the different types of floaters the cost analysis focused on the production and acquisition phase of the substructures comprising their material and fabrication costs the fabrication cost has been approached by evaluating the bulk structural and ballast material price and a manufacturing complexity factor mcf reflecting not only the complexity with respect to fabrication but also how suitable the design is for mass production myhr et al 2014 material cost includes the cost of support structure and the ballast material either steel or concrete as discussed in section 3 1 prices of materials are summarised in table 1 although seawater used as ballast material needs to undergo a water treatment process the cost is considered negligible and hence it is omitted from the calculations mcfs have also been used in the shipping industry nam et al 2012 introduced an updated scalar metric for the assessment of the complexity of a hull form of ships or complex offshore structural bodies aiming at helping the designer estimate the cost in the early design stage the value of the metric accounted for the complexity in geometric shape of the important inner structural members of the hull form such as the longitudinals stiffeners and web frames attached to the hull surface similarly gordo and leal 2018 introduced an innovative complexity metric that provided a way to compare similar or different ship types and sizes at the contract design stage a number of criteria were used as tools enabling alternatives to be assessed from the point of view of complexity grouped according to the location of each criterion inside the ship e g the engine room the space above the watertight deck and below the strength deck etc in the context of this study the mcfs are coefficients that can be applied on the estimated mass of material to account for the complexity of the manufacturing process and estimate the fabrication cost of the platform by multiplying the mcf with the material cost as mentioned above this practice is often used for costing during the conceptual stage of the design the mcf reflects a number of parameters including i number of parts plates and stiffeners ii amount of weldings of frames and stiffeners iii heavy lift cranes required for the assembly and welding of parts and iv ability for serial production space required for serial manufacturing storage and handling etc among others as detailed designs of floating support structures and data are not available in literature and usually not provided by manufacturers and designers due to confidentiality reasons the mcf can be used as a proxy to estimate the fabrication cost in relation to a benchmark design the elicitation of the manufacturing complexity factors across the different types of floating offshore wind support structures was realised through a survey among experts responses from 9 experts were collected from industry and academia considering the fabrication cost of the fixed monopile with steel as structural material as the benchmark case assigned a value of 1 experts were requested to provide relative manufacturing complexity factors across the different support structures having as main structural material a steel and b concrete after removing the outliers of the sample the average mcf values listed in table 2 were derived which were accordingly fed as inputs in the analysis as the total costs are highly dependent on these unit values a sensitivity study was carried out in the discussion of section 5 nevertheless other cost components such as the cost of moorings anchors installation o m and decommission costs can impact the profitability of the asset and should be taken into consideration when more detailed designs are examined furthermore the time dependence of the cost has not been considered in the analysis e g in terms of net present value and learning curve effects 4 results 4 1 hydrostatic analysis the hydrostatic analysis represented by equations 1a 1b are applied to the dtu 10 mw wind turbine bak et al 2013 whose main parameter values are presented in table 3 in this sense the centre of gravity of the wind turbine is assumed to be located at the middle of the hub height z c g t u r b i n e h h u b 2 the floating platforms considered in the hydrostatic analysis are the barge spar and semi submersible the barge type is considered as a shallow large cylinder the spar type as a deep slender cylinder and the semi submersible type as three cylindrical columns linked with the wind turbine located at the centre as shown in fig 2 for the purpose of this study a simple case based on the hydrostatic laws to restore in pitch with the inclination angle as θ 5 ο is solved to select the ballast material sea water or concrete for each floating platform steel ρ s t e e l 7850 kg m3 and concrete ρ c o n c r e t e 2400 kg m3 are selected as the alternative structural materials of the floating platforms the thicknesses of steel and concrete considered are 0 07 m and 0 15 m respectively these clearly are approximate values which in the absence of a structural analysis are chosen to also account for internal stiffening table 4 shows the values for the free board f b the draft d the ballast height h b the radius of the columns r and the distance between the cylindrical columns and the wind turbine of the semi sub support structure d c fig 2 illustrates the key parameters of each floating support structure in this sense the concrete is selected as ballast material for the barge and spar types on the other hand it is not possible to find a hydrostatic solution for the concrete as ballast material in the semi submersible type therefore seawater as ballast material is selected for the semi submersible type then based on the selected ballast material a parametric analysis of the dimensions of floating platforms in relation to the draft d is solved the fixed values of the floating platforms are specified in table 5 for the barge and spar types the value of the radius r and the ballast height h b are calculated to satisfy the hydrostatic analysis whereas the value of the radius r and the distance between the cylindrical columns and the wind turbine d c are calculated for the semi submersible type to simplify the analysis the mooring forces were estimated as the 5 of the total weight force figs 3 5 illustrate the parametric analyses considering the steel and the concrete as structural materials for the barge spar and semi submersible types respectively it can be observed that both materials provide very similar values of the radius r and the ballast height h b for the barge and spar types while a higher difference is observed when it comes to the semi submersible type the obtained radius decreases when the draft increases whereas the distance between the centre of the cylinder and the wind turbine in the semi submersible type increases when the draft increases in addition it can be observed that the barge type leads to relatively low draft e g d 2 m but it is at the cost of a high radius e g r 25 m in contrast the spar type leads to relatively low radius e g r 5 5 m but for high draft e g d 150 m the semi submersible type in turns leads to high distance between the columns and the tower e g d c 29 m at the cost of relatively low radius e g r 6 m finally the steel structural support mass is calculated and compared against the concrete structural mass in fig 6 although the obtained dimensions are similar the obtained structural mass values are different due to the contrasting different densities of both steel and concrete with the highest values reached for the steel as expected in terms of the typology observe that the highest value of the structural mass corresponds with the semi submersible type followed by the spar type 4 2 cost analysis the material and manufacturing costs of the different floating support structures including the support structure and the ballast material as a function of the draft values of the structure are illustrated in fig 7 in general the material and fabrication costs or else the production and acquisition cost of the floating support structures are proportional to the support structure mass values of the different configurations shown in fig 7 semi sub structures with steel as structural material seem to be the most expensive solution if the ballast material is concrete when evaluating only the material and production costs as a result of the large steel consumption and their complex geometry spar costs appear to decrease with higher draft values resulting from the reduction in the ballast mass concrete based floating support structures appear to be cheaper than their steel based counterparts nevertheless concrete structures tend to be larger and there are issues with their massive production 5 sensitivity analysis and discussion this section performs sensitivity analysis to indicate the impact of uncertainty of key input parameters which were considered as fixed in the analysis on the production and acquisition cost of floating support structures as such the uncertainty around the thicknesses of support structures the mcfs and the bulk price of steel and concrete were further investigated in order to examine the impact of the thicknesses of the support structures on the economic feasibility of a project a sensitivity analysis was employed for a set of draft values namely for the spar d 75 m for the semi submersible d 20 m finally for the barge the draft was assumed equal to 10 m the rest of the wind turbine general specifications were considered fixed and we tested the sensitivity of the support structure thickness with respect to the material and manufacturing cost the results of the sensitivity analysis are illustrated in fig 8 results were derived upon 10 and 20 change in the thickness values of the different floaters ξ the cost of material and manufacturing appears to be more sensitive under a change in the thickness of steel based support structures rather than the concrete based support structures especially in the case of semi sub floaters only slight differences can be observed in the cost of the structures when increasing decreasing the thickness of the concrete structures as the total costs are highly dependent on the production and acquisition cost of the floating support structures a further sensitivity study on the manufacturing complexity factors was undertaken similarly to the above approach the impact of a 20 change of the complexity factors of the different structures on the material and fabrication cost was estimated and results are presented in fig 9 steel based semi submersible and spar structures appeared to be more sensitive upon a change of their mcfs while for the barge support structure the impact on cost highly depends on the draft values fig 10 illustrates the impact of the bulk prices of steel and concrete across the different floaters on the production and acquisition cost as per a 20 change in their values as a function of the draft it is expected that since the fabrication cost of the floating support structure depends on the bulk price of the materials this input parameter would have a significant impact on the final production and acquisition cost which is verified by the larger ranges in the total cost production and acquisition cost is not the sole metric to take into account when performing a comparative study across the different floaters risks associated with different floating substructures can be found throughout the whole life cycle of the asset several studies in literature have undertaken risk identification studies across the different typologies irena 2016 james and ros 2015 leimeister et al 2018 proskovics 2017 proskovics et al 2016 proskovics and smart 2017 taboada 2015 most studies focus on spar buoys semi submersible and tension leg platforms when listing risks opportunities threats and benefits of alternative concepts categorising the barge concept under the buoyancy stabilised semi submersible type common risks widely cited in literature are summarised in table 6 currently there is no clear winner with regards to the different concepts as each of them carry their own strengths and weaknesses which are often defined by the specific site conditions clearly the analysis performed is a preliminary stability cost assessment and further detailed work is required to assess hydrodynamic dynamic response characteristics structural integrity and environmental impact a more rigorous analysis should take into consideration the detailed design of the offshore wind support structures incorporating the hydrodynamic effects and the sea wave impact on the structure 6 conclusions floating wind turbines can provide a solution for harvesting wind energy in deeper waters while also exploiting higher capacity factors and availing of the benefit of being mobile for safer installation and maintenance operations the aim of this paper is to perform a parametric analysis for the preliminary design of different typologies and structural materials for floating support structures based on the results of a hydrostatic analysis concrete appears to be the most cost effective ballast material for barge and spar types while for the semi submersible type water was considered the most appropriate cost analysis focusing on the cost of the material in the support structure and the ballast as well as the manufacturing cost of the floating concepts indicated that steel based semi submersible structures are expected to be more expensive due to their complex geometry and amount of steel required while the barge configuration appeared as the lowest overall cost alternative further work should focus on defining the detailed designs of the mooring systems and carring out a comprehensive analysis concerning hydrodynamic stability and structural integrity in addition the sheer size and the cost of the floater lead us to consider ways to maximise the power generating capacity of the installation through supporting multiple turbines in this sense alternative types for floating wind platforms extreme barges or very large floating structures vlfs should be investigated furthermore expanding the work within the techno economic analysis of the floating configurations would provide better informed decisions on the feasibility of projects mooring lines anchor costs and installation costs of each floating support structure should also be considered in the context of the parametric analysis estimation of revenues and the impact of economic parameters such as the weighted average cost of capital reflecting the investment risk and maturity of the technology are important factors affecting the profitability of project the present work can be particularly relevant for researchers and developers working at the conceptual stage of the development of floating support structures providing insights on the optimal

22178,the rapid development of the offshore wind industry is leading stimulating interest in exploiting wind resources in deeper waters and farther offshore requiring alternative support structures including floating foundations currently a number of different concepts are under development aiming to become commercialised for deployment in the near future one of the main barriers against their widespread adoption is cost which is currently considerably higher than fixed support structures this paper investigates through a parametric study the total mass and cost of three floater concepts spar barge and semi submersible particularly focusing on the material and manufacturing costs the manufacturing cost was approached by means of manufacturing complexity factors whose values were obtained through a survey among experts in floating offshore wind key finding of this work under the defined conditions is the fact that semi sub structures with steel as structural material appeared to be the most expensive configuration spar costs decrease with higher draft values due to the reduction in the ballast mass while the barge solution is potentially the lowest cost alternative nevertheless risks and benefits of different configurations should also be considered alongside as they could lead to savings throughout the service life of the asset keywords floating wind turbines

association et al 2015 for this target to be achieved deep water locations must be explored this trend is highlighted in ioannou et al 2018a where wind farms in water depths exceeding 45 m and distance to shore of more than 110 km have already been developed moving yet further offshore also means that better wind resources can be exploited while at the same time limiting visual impact from land and away from competing with other users of the sea kaldellis et al 2016 leung and yang 2012 currently a number of concepts have been developed as summarised in james and ros 2015 leimeister et al 2018 mast e 2015 which are expected to be more suitable and economically viable in depths greater than 60 m the floaters for offshore wind must supply adequate buoyancy to support the weight of the wind turbine and to restrain the motions within acceptable limits butterfield et al 2007 the stabilization mechanisms are i ballast stabilised ii water plane or buoyancy stabilised and iii mooring stabilised in the first case a large ballast deep at the bottom of the floating structure moves the centre of gravity of the total system below the centre of buoyancy leading to a stabilising righting moment which counteracts rotational displacements in the second mechanism a large second moment of area with respect to the rotational axis creates a stabilising righting moment in case of rotational displacement finally mooring stabilised floaters have high tensioned mooring lines which generate the restoring moments when the structures are inclined based on the stabilization mechanisms floaters are generally classified as either a spar barge semi submersible or tension leg platform tlp floaters raise new challenges however also raise the prospect of developing offshore wind farms in a radically new way for example lumbreras and ramos 2013 reviewed the main developments in offshore wind turbine layout optimisation with a particular focus on the electrical design other authors have focused on alternative uses of electricity for non grid connected ngc floating wind ngc floating ow can address some key issues including the deep waters and lack of grid connection furthermore it can be used to take advantage of the far ow energy potential characterised by high winds and limited seasonal variations which would be prohibitively expensive to connect to the grid to this end innovative solutions presenting remarkable market potential have been explored by industry and academia at a conceptual level to exploit the untapped wind energy potential far offshore related activities that can be possibly performed for ngc wind farms include hydrogen production utilising water electrolysis integrated unit to produce ammonia aquaculture producing fish shellfish and sea weeds concepts for multi purpose platforms in deep waters have been investigated in the past by research projects such as the tropos project consortium of tropos project 2015 developing modular multi use platforms integrating several activities amongst which aquaculture production and renewable energy conversion h2ocean project huebscher and urbano 2015 developed a wind wave power open sea platform equipped for hydrogen generation the uk offshore wind industry has achieved a rapid reduction in the levelised cost of electricity lcoe attributed to the technology innovation maturing supply chain and higher capacity factors from the deployment of wind farms farther offshore although the capital costs including also development costs for offshore projects have increased between 2010 and 2016 by a weighted average of 4 peaking at around 2012 2013 due to costlier installations further offshore the impact of increasing costs was moderated by the better wind resource and turbine technology increasing the capacity factor of the wind farms operation and maintenance costs is a significant part of the project s lcoe comprising approximately 30 of total lcoe ioannou et al 2018b and initial full service contracts amounted to 10 7 23 kw year while their renewal costed 16 8 33 6 kw year following 5 years of operation between 2008 and 2017 irena 2018 there is large market potential for floating offshore wind however commercialization of the technology has not yet been realised depending on the growth of investments in this early stage of the technology towards promoting supply chain capability and gradual scaling up in project size future costs are predicted to range amounting 200 mwh in 2018 for demonstration projects to 85 mwh in 2027 for first commercial projects catapult offshore renewable energy 2018 the cost of floating support structures has a higher capex share than the fixed bottom s foundation indicatively the floating substructure of a reference wind power plant accounts for approximately 29 5 of the capex of the project as opposed to 13 5 for a fixed bottom reference project stehly et al 2018 depending on the floater type this value can be higher or lower and significantly influence the profitability of the project to this end focus should be put on the impact of key design parameters on the cost of the substructure this paper aims to investigate through a parametric study the impact of key design parameters of three typical floating concepts namely the spar barge and semi submersible on the total mass production and acquisition cost by performing a hydrostatic analysis for each concept this study will be particularly relevant for researchers and developers at the conceptual stage of the development of floating support structures as it performs a preliminary stability assessment cost analysis focusing on global design parameters for a detailed cost analysis of the different concepts higher fidelity breakdown of costs should take place at a conceptual stage however these details are often not present and hence higher level analysis is required the paper is organised as follows section 2 presents a literature review focusing particularly on parametric equations for floating wind turbines and cost modelling section 3 discusses the methodology employed for this analysis while section 4 presents results of the hydrostatic analysis and translation into production and acquisition cost of floating support structures section 5 presents a discussion on the results also providing a sensitivity analysis of key input parameters section 6 presents conclusions of this work and recommendations for future work 2 literature review a review of literature reveals a number of relevant publications al ramthan and aubeny 2018 studied the performance of suction caissons for floating offshore wind turbines under inclined survival loads to this end authors presented a parametric study in which the effects of inclined load angle cyclic amplitude and soil stiffness are evaluated kumawat et al 2019 investigated a semi submersible floating wind turbine combined with flap type wecs with a parametric study to compute hydrodynamic coefficients of flap and three column semi submersible platform combined wave and wind energy system shokouhian et al 2019 focused on the hydrodynamic response of a semi submersible platform to support a wind turbine presenting a parametric study of the influence of different parameters on the hydrodynamic response of the platform including total mass mooring material

the storage capacity the spar geometry and the additional mass of the floating configuration to support high air pressures pereyra et al 2018 performed a parametric study of a counter weight suspension system for the tetra spar floating wind turbine to satisfy the design criteria a global hydrodynamic load and response ruzzo and arena 2018 conducted a numerical study on the dynamic

and the initial conditions in terms of body motions de guzmán et al 2018 introduce a reduced draft spar concept for large offshore wind turbines through a parametric design process is used to obtain the platform main dimensions micallef et al 2017 studied the dynamic analysis of a floating hybrid spar tension leg platform concept for wind monitoring applications in deep sea carrying out a parametric analysis for different geometrical and met ocean conditions and the simulations were restricted to regular single frequency wave and constant wind speed conditions only hartmann et al 2017 studied the issue of the installation of a tlp structure through a parametric study of the tlp s structure to gain hydrostatic and hydrodynamic stability during the transport and installation process of the tlp equipped with a 6 mw wind turbine rahmdel et al 2016 performed a parametric study of spar type floating offshore wind turbines fowts by numerical and experimental investigations lemmer né sandner et al 2016 reported a parametric wave disturbance model for an improved representation of the overall system dynamics of a floating wind turbine fowt si et al 2014 performed the modelling and optimisation of a passive structural control design for a spar type floating wind turbine providing parametric analysis and design basis for future improvement on floating wind turbine load reduction with structural control methods benassai et al 2014 studied the mooring control of tri floater support structures for wind turbines by means of a numerical parametric study both catenary and vertical tensioned mooring lines where are considered chen and yu 2013 present design requirements for floating offshore wind turbines where the relative importance of various design parameters and their impact on the development of design criteria are evaluated through parametric analyses finally jeon et al 2013 studied the sloshing characteristics of an annular cylindrical tuned liquid damper for spar type floating offshore wind turbine parametrically by experiment aiming at the exploration of its successful use for suppressing the structural vibration of spar type floating wind turbine subject to multidirectional wind wave and current excitations 3 methodology as this paper focuses on the conceptual design of floating support structures the analysis will be based on hydrostatic laws and basic cost modelling in this section a brief description of this theory is presented 3 1 hydrostatic analysis the hydrostatic analysis was carried out to verify that floaters provide enough buoyancy to support the weight of the turbine and to restrain pitch roll and heave motions within acceptable limits the hydrostatic laws in pitch for a spar semi submersible and barge floating wind platforms could be defined by the buoyancy equation eq 1a and the restoring equation eq 1b as follows 1a m t o t a l ρ w v 1b ρ w g i y f b z c b f w z c g sin θ f t h h u b f b z c b where m t o t a l is the total mass of the structure considering the turbine the support the ballast and the mooring system g is the gravity acceleration ρ w is the water density v is the volume of the displaced fluid i y is the second moment of area with respect to the y axis f b is the buoyancy force z c b is the centre of buoyancy the point through which the resultant of all buoyant forces on a body may be assumed to act f w is the weight force z c g is the centre of gravity the point where all the weights constituting the system may be assumed to act θ is the inclination angle f t is the thrust force h h u b is the height hub and f b is the free board fig 1 illustrates the applied forces and reference points of the structure the left hand side of eq 1b represents the stabilization mechanics where the first term corresponds to the water plane area stabilised whereas the second and third term corresponds to the ballast stabilised 3 2 cost analysis the cost analysis of floating wind turbines is associated with the calculation of all costs throughout the service life of the assets detailed studies distinguishing key cost components of fixed support structures have been reported in ioannou et al 2018a b ioannou et al 2017 the costs are broken down into capex opex and devex capex includes the capital costs during the development and consenting production and acquisition installation and commissioning phases of the project opex includes the cost during the operation and maintenance o m phase and devex the costs during the decommissioning and disposal phase in this study opex and devex have been considered equal across the different floating concepts and the same has been assumed for all capital costs except for the material and manufacturing costs which have been adapted to the specific configuration of the floaters as the scope of this paper is to perform a comparative analysis across the different types of floaters the cost analysis focused on the production and acquisition phase of the substructures comprising their material and fabrication costs the fabrication cost has been approached by evaluating the bulk structural and ballast material price and a manufacturing complexity factor mcf reflecting not only the complexity with respect to fabrication but also how suitable the design is for mass production myhr et al 2014 material cost includes the cost of support structure and the ballast material either steel or concrete as discussed in section 3 1 prices of materials are summarised in table 1 although seawater used as ballast material needs to undergo a water treatment process the cost is considered negligible and hence it is omitted from the calculations mcfs have also been used in the shipping industry nam et al 2012 introduced an updated scalar metric for the assessment of the complexity of a hull form of ships or complex offshore structural bodies aiming at helping the designer estimate the cost in the early design stage the value of the metric accounted for the complexity in geometric shape of the important inner structural members of the hull form such as the longitudinals stiffeners and web frames attached to the hull surface similarly gordo and leal 2018 introduced an innovative complexity metric that provided a way to compare similar or different ship types and sizes at the contract design stage a number of criteria were used as tools enabling alternatives to be assessed from the point of view of complexity grouped according to the location of each criterion inside the ship e g the engine room the space above the watertight deck and below the strength deck etc in the context of this study the mcfs are coefficients that can be applied on the estimated mass of material to account for the complexity of the manufacturing process and estimate the fabrication cost of the platform by multiplying the mcf with the material cost as mentioned above this practice is often used for costing during the conceptual stage of the design the mcf reflects a number of parameters including i number of parts plates and stiffeners ii amount of weldings of frames and stiffeners iii heavy lift cranes required for the assembly and welding of parts and iv ability for serial production space required for serial manufacturing storage and handling etc among others as detailed designs of floating support structures and data are not available in literature and usually not provided by manufacturers and designers due to confidentiality reasons the mcf can be used as a proxy to estimate the fabrication cost in relation to a benchmark design the elicitation of the manufacturing complexity factors across the different types of floating offshore wind support structures was realised through a survey among experts responses from 9 experts were collected from industry and academia considering the fabrication cost of the fixed monopile with steel as structural material as the benchmark case assigned a value of 1 experts were requested to provide relative manufacturing complexity factors across the different support structures having as main structural material a steel and b concrete after removing the outliers of the sample the average mcf values listed in table 2 were derived which were accordingly fed as inputs in the analysis as the total costs are highly dependent on these unit values a sensitivity study was carried out in the discussion of section 5 nevertheless other cost components such as the cost of moorings anchors installation o m and decommission costs can impact the profitability of the asset and should be taken into consideration when more detailed designs are examined furthermore the time dependence of the cost has not been considered in the analysis e g in terms of net present value and learning curve effects 4 results 4 1 hydrostatic analysis the hydrostatic analysis represented by equations 1a 1b are applied to the dtu 10 mw wind turbine bak et al 2013 whose main parameter values are presented in table 3 in this sense the centre of gravity of the wind turbine is assumed to be located at the middle of the hub height z c g t u r b i n e h h u b 2 the floating platforms considered in the hydrostatic analysis are the barge spar and semi submersible the barge type is considered as a shallow large cylinder the spar type as a deep slender cylinder and the semi submersible type as three cylindrical columns linked with the wind turbine located at the centre as shown in fig 2 for the purpose of this study a simple case based on the hydrostatic laws to restore in pitch with the inclination angle as θ 5 ο is solved to select the ballast material sea water or concrete for each floating platform steel ρ s t e e l 7850 kg m3 and concrete ρ c o n c r e t e 2400 kg m3 are selected as the alternative structural materials of the floating platforms the thicknesses of steel and concrete considered are 0 07 m and 0 15 m respectively these clearly are approximate values which in the absence of a structural analysis are chosen to also account for internal stiffening table 4 shows the values for the free board f b the draft d the ballast height h b the radius of the columns r and the distance between the cylindrical columns and the wind turbine of the semi sub support structure d c fig 2 illustrates the key parameters of each floating support structure in this sense the concrete is selected as ballast material for the barge and spar types on the other hand it is not possible to find a hydrostatic solution for the concrete as ballast material in the semi submersible type therefore seawater as ballast material is selected for the semi submersible type then based on the selected ballast material a parametric analysis of the dimensions of floating platforms in relation to the draft d is solved the fixed values of the floating platforms are specified in table 5 for the barge and spar types the value of the radius r and the ballast height h b are calculated to satisfy the hydrostatic analysis whereas the value of the radius r and the distance between the cylindrical columns and the wind turbine d c are calculated for the semi submersible type to simplify the analysis the mooring forces were estimated as the 5 of the total weight force figs 3 5 illustrate the parametric analyses considering the steel and the concrete as structural materials for the barge spar and semi submersible types respectively it can be observed that both materials provide very similar values of the radius r and the ballast height h b for the barge and spar types while a higher difference is observed when it comes to the semi submersible type the obtained radius decreases when the draft increases whereas the distance between the centre of the cylinder and the wind turbine in the semi submersible type increases when the draft increases in addition it can be observed that the barge type leads to relatively low draft e g d 2 m but it is at the cost of a high radius e g r 25 m in contrast the spar type leads to relatively low radius e g r 5 5 m but for high draft e g d 150 m the semi submersible type in turns leads to high distance between the columns and the tower e g d c 29 m at the cost of relatively low radius e g r 6 m finally the steel structural support mass is calculated and compared against the concrete structural mass in fig 6 although the obtained dimensions are similar the obtained structural mass values are different due to the contrasting different densities of both steel and concrete with the highest values reached for the steel as expected in terms of the typology observe that the highest value of the structural mass corresponds with the semi submersible type followed by the spar type 4 2 cost analysis the material and manufacturing costs of the different floating support structures including the support structure and the ballast material as a function of the draft values of the structure are illustrated in fig 7 in general the material and fabrication costs or else the production and acquisition cost of the floating support structures are proportional to the support structure mass values of the different configurations shown in fig 7 semi sub structures with steel as structural material seem to be the most expensive solution if the ballast material is concrete when evaluating only the material and production costs as a result of the large steel consumption and their complex geometry spar costs appear to decrease with higher draft values resulting from the reduction in the ballast mass concrete based floating support structures appear to be cheaper than their steel based counterparts nevertheless concrete structures tend to be larger and there are issues with their massive production 5 sensitivity analysis and discussion this section performs sensitivity analysis to indicate the impact of uncertainty of key input parameters which were considered as fixed in the analysis on the production and acquisition cost of floating support structures as such the uncertainty around the thicknesses of support structures the mcfs and the bulk price of steel and concrete were further investigated in order to examine the impact of the thicknesses of the support structures on the economic feasibility of a project a sensitivity analysis was employed for a set of draft values namely for the spar d 75 m for the semi submersible d 20 m finally for the barge the draft was assumed equal to 10 m the rest of the wind turbine general specifications were considered fixed and we tested the sensitivity of the support structure thickness with respect to the material and manufacturing cost the results of the sensitivity analysis are illustrated in fig 8 results were derived upon 10 and 20 change in the thickness values of the different floaters ξ the cost of material and manufacturing appears to be more sensitive under a change in the thickness of steel based support structures rather than the concrete based support structures especially in the case of semi sub floaters only slight differences can be observed in the cost of the structures when increasing decreasing the thickness of the concrete structures as the total costs are highly dependent on the production and acquisition cost of the floating support structures a further sensitivity study on the manufacturing complexity factors was undertaken similarly to the above approach the impact of a 20 change of the complexity factors of the different structures on the material and fabrication cost was estimated and results are presented in fig 9 steel based semi submersible and spar structures appeared to be more sensitive upon a change of their mcfs while for the barge support structure the impact on cost highly depends on the draft values fig 10 illustrates the impact of the bulk prices of steel and concrete across the different floaters on the production and acquisition cost as per a 20 change in their values as a function of the draft it is expected that since the fabrication cost of the floating support structure depends on the bulk price of the materials this input parameter would have a significant impact on the final production and acquisition cost which is verified by the larger ranges in the total cost production and acquisition cost is not the sole metric to take into account when performing a comparative study across the different floaters risks associated with different floating substructures can be found throughout the whole life cycle of the asset several studies in literature have undertaken risk identification studies across the different typologies irena 2016 james and ros 2015 leimeister et al 2018 proskovics 2017 proskovics et al 2016 proskovics and smart 2017 taboada 2015 most studies focus on spar buoys semi submersible and tension leg platforms when listing risks opportunities threats and benefits of alternative concepts categorising the barge concept under the buoyancy stabilised semi submersible type common risks widely cited in literature are summarised in table 6 currently there is no clear winner with regards to the different concepts as each of them carry their own strengths and weaknesses which are often defined by the specific site conditions clearly the analysis performed is a preliminary stability cost assessment and further detailed work is required to assess hydrodynamic dynamic response characteristics structural integrity and environmental impact a more rigorous analysis should take into consideration the detailed design of the offshore wind support structures incorporating the hydrodynamic effects and the sea wave impact on the structure 6 conclusions floating wind turbines can provide a solution for harvesting wind energy in deeper waters while also exploiting higher capacity factors and availing of the benefit of being mobile for safer installation and maintenance operations the aim of this paper is to perform a parametric analysis for the preliminary design of different typologies and structural materials for floating support structures based on the results of a hydrostatic analysis concrete appears to be the most cost effective ballast material for barge and spar types while for the semi submersible type water was considered the most appropriate cost analysis focusing on the cost of the material in the support structure and the ballast as well as the manufacturing cost of the floating concepts indicated that steel based semi submersible structures are expected to be more expensive due to their complex geometry and amount of steel required while the barge configuration appeared as the lowest overall cost alternative further work should focus on defining the detailed designs of the mooring systems and carring out a comprehensive analysis concerning hydrodynamic stability and structural integrity in addition the sheer size and the cost of the floater lead us to consider ways to maximise the power generating capacity of the installation through supporting multiple turbines in this sense alternative types for floating wind platforms extreme barges or very large floating structures vlfs should be investigated furthermore expanding the work within the techno economic analysis of the floating configurations would provide better informed decisions on the feasibility of projects mooring lines anchor costs and installation costs of each floating support structure should also be considered in the context of the parametric analysis estimation of revenues and the impact of economic parameters such as the weighted average cost of capital reflecting the investment risk and maturity of the technology are important factors affecting the profitability of project the present work can be particularly relevant for researchers and developers working at the conceptual stage of the development of floating support structures providing insights on the optimal configuration of different concepts and the ballast materials of each concept based on the results of the hydrostatic analysis furthermore it can provide a basis on performing a comparative cost

22179,the synergetic offshore wind dataset derived from a combination of scatterometers quikscat oscat and ascat a b have been utilised and validated with available buoy data it is observed that the mean deviation in wind speed between the co located buoy and synergetic scatterometer data is small of the order 2 and the power density showed a difference of 2 5 the combined synergetic maps of wind speed wind power density and practical power production from two offshore wind turbines v112 3m and g128 5m have been analysed and evaluated on a seasonal and annual basis further considering the

turbines at 80 m hub height this would reduce overall carbon emissions of 3117 and 4418 million tons respectively per year finally the levelised cost of energy is computed for two optimum sites in shallow waters off gujarat and tamil nadu coasts and found to be lowest of around 106 87 mwh in tamil nadu site suggesting an optimum site for wind farm development keywords wind energy resource offshore wind scatterometer india 1 introduction global warming over millennial time scales is caused due to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions produced by several human activities dietz et al 2016 snyder 2016 the coastal regions of most of the countries have been heavily exploited in terms of industrialisation and urbanisation due to its close proximity to several natural resources as a result the energy requirement has been increased to several folds with the exhaustion of fossil fuels and increasing awareness on environmental issues harnessing energy from available resources has become a prime focus in developing countries many countries have realized that the exploitation of new and renewable energy resources is the only solution to suffice the ever growing demand for electricity buonocore et al 2016 among the renewable resources wind power is a very large energy source with proven commercial technology and very low or negligible co2 emissions archer and jacobson 2005 as of july 2018 india ranks third largest power generation capacity in the world with about 345 5 gw and third largest consumer of electricity central electricity authority 2018a there are no offshore wind farms installed in the country as on today the latest national offshore wind energy policy 2015 boosts the development of offshore wind farms within the indian exclusive economic zone eez the first offshore wind project of india fowpi with the capacity of 200 mw has been initiated in the coastal waters off gujarat fowind 2015 with the utilization of onshore and the upcoming offshore wind farms the government of india has set a target to achieve 60 gw power generation capacities by 2022 and reduction in carbon emissions by 33 35 of its gdp by 2030 government of india 2015 the technologies and fuel sources india adopts as it adds this electricity generation capacity may make a significant impact on global resource usage and environmental issues generally wind energy potential for a particular region is estimated from long term data collected from meteorological stations sheridan et al 2012 however there are very limited offshore met buoys that have long term data existing for the country within the eez fig 1 which limits the assessment of wind power potential in both space and time the wind energy is directly proportional to the cube of the wind speed a small error in the wind speed measurement could result in large deviations in the wind energy estimations carvalho et al 2014 hasager et al 2015 therefore accurate wind datasets are required for this purpose the other sources of in situ data are from light detection and ranging lidar and sound detection and ranging sodar hasager et al 2008 but they are limited to a particular region and are not readily available there are several alternatives for the in situ offshore wind measurements like satellite remote sensing scatterometers synthetic aperture radars etc numerical weather prediction nwp

2012 karamanis et al 2011 nagababu et al 2015 pimenta et al 2008 remmers et al 2019 which limits the evaluation near the coastal region due to land contamination in the data some researchers have used blended winds derived from multiple scatterometers radiometers and reanalysis data carvalho et al 2016 soukissian and papadopoulos 2015 in addition mostly the assessments were confined to a single or dual scatterometer only refer to table 1 all the earlier work on the assessment of offshore wind resources of india were confined to an overall potential using different data sources like model reanalysis nagababu et al 2017b a single scatterometer data gadad and deka 2016 and are limited to a specific period of time a detailed comprehensive assessment of offshore wind power potential using long term synergetic scatterometers data has not been attempted so far a study on the assessment of offshore wind resource in india using multiple scatterometers surisetty et al 2019 2016 and risat 1 sar was carried out surisetty et al 2016 however the study lacks the comparison and adjustment of scatterometers data the major objective of the present study is to provide a detailed comprehensive assessment of offshore wind energy utilize the synergetic combined scatterometer data of quikscat oscat ascat a and ascat b at 12 5 km spatial resolution a comparison of combined scatterometer wind speed data has been done with offshore met buoys further various wind and power parameters have been assessed by considering bathymetry and conflict zones such as shipping lanes visual and avian zones at last the total amount of carbon emissions that can be reduced effectively using offshore wind energy exploration is evaluated fig 1 shows the major electricity usage centres of india inferred from a sky night brightness image signifying the importance of the study the regions of gujarat gj maharashtra mh tamil nadu tn some parts of andhra pradesh ap odisha od and west bengal wb are the most populated centres of indian coastal region having a heavy electrical load hence offshore wind resource would suffice the present and future needs of these coastal states and the surplus power can be

analysis 2 1 1 generation of combined scatterometer data the equatorial time of crossing for ascending descending passes of quikscat oscat and ascat are 06 00 18 00 12 00 00 00 and 21 30 09 30 hours respectively the obvious advantages of the synergetic approach of utilising multiple scatterometers are i increase in the number of overlapping samples decreases the statistical uncertainty and ii different scatterometers have different overpass times thus at any location over the sea more diurnal variations can be included in the analysis hasager et al 2015 the data would be more appropriate along the coastal regions where such variations in winds are observed therefore we can get more coverage of wind if we consider all the scatterometers data this increases the accuracy of the offshore wind resource assessment the merging was done by collecting samples from each satellite and applying spatial averaging of all the data points centered at a regular grid of 0 125 12 5 km hasager et al 2015 the errors associated with each scatterometer have been estimated with respect to the offshore wind buoys and the wind speeds have been adjusted using coefficients derived from linear regression technique refer table 2 in surisetty et al 2019 monthly fields were generated by averaging the daily fields seventeen year climatological monthly means were computed using the data from january 2000 december 2016 for each 12 5 km grid cell statistics of wind speed wind power density and power production at 10 m height and 80 m hub height was computed 2 2 in situ wind data in situ wind measurements from the offshore meteorological buoys were obtained from the research moored array for african asian australian monsoon analysis and prediction rama buoys and from the indian national centre for ocean information services incois buoys with ad bd and cb name tags the locations of the aforementioned buoys buoy id position distance to the nearest coast data coverage are provided in fig 1 and table 3 as evident from the table many of the buoys have less than 5 years of data the uncertainty of the statistical estimates increases as the available sample sizes decrease hasager et al 2015 soukissian et al 2017 therefore statistics from a long time series of in situ data versus combined synergetic scatterometer data sets have to be considered the measured data were available at 10 min interval and at a 10 m height above mean sea level m s l and were temporally interpolated according to the availability of scatterometer time of passes in addition measured wind data at different heights viz 10 m 50 m 80 m 100 m and 102 m from an onshore mast installed at dhanushkodi 9 10 4 78 n 79 25 44 29 e tamil nadu were obtained from the national institute of wind energy niwe 3 methods 3 1 wind speed variability it is important to consider the variability of wind speed in wind climate analysis and wind energy applications soukissian et al 2017 there are two parameters namely the mean annual mav and inter annual variability iav of wind speed which is generally considered for identifying a suitable site for wind farms mav is a measure of variability within each year and depicts the seasonal differences in wind behavior the mean annual variability denoted as mav is expressed as the mean value of the ratio of standard deviation per year to the mean value of wind speed per year for the time period under consideration and is estimated by 1 mav 1 j j 1 j s u j m u j 1 j j 1 j cv j cv where s u j m u j and cv j denote the standard deviation mean value and the coefficient of variation of wind speed for the year j j 1 2 j respectively cv represents the mean annual value of the coefficient of variation and j is the total length of the data in years inter annual variability denoted as iav is defined as the ratio of the standard deviation of the annual mean wind speed m u j j 1 2 j represented by s m u j to the overall mean of wind speed i e m u given by 2 iav s m u j m u 3 2 extrapolation of wind speed as the scatterometer derived winds are at 10 m above the sea surface the logarithmic wind profile was used to extrapolate the measured winds to hub height h assuming the neutral stability of the atmosphere and a surface roughness of z 0 0 2 mm recommended as an average value for calm and open seas manwell et al 2009 according to the log law the velocity v h at a given height h is 3 v h v 10 log h z 0 log 10 z 0 where v 10 is the wind speed at height 10 m above the sea level 3 3 wind power density and wind energy wind power density e represents the flow of kinetic energy per unit associated with the wind given in units of watts per square meter w m 2 as 4 e 1 2 ρ v 3 for simplification in the computation a constant air density ρ 1 225 kg m 3 was used the power density is an expedient measure as it is independent of turbine characteristics generally the actual power production expected from a wind turbine depends on several factors like the efficiency of the rotor generator flow mechanics of the blades etc theoretical power production can be estimated using eac p where a is the turbine swept area and c p is the efficiency the power generated by a turbine is represented by the power curve normally provided by the turbine manufacturer considering mechanics of the flow passing through the blades and the efficiency of the rotor generator fig 2 shows the power curves p t v and table 4 shows the characteristics of two turbines vestas v112 3 mw ve 3m here after and gamesa g128 5 mw gm 5m here after used in this study the selection of turbines is completely hypothetical offshore projects require the use of the powerful wind turbines on the market and in general 3 mw and 5 mw turbines are commonly used the data has been obtained from the manufacturers of the respective turbines source https wind turbine models com their characteristics such as cut in the minimum speed required to operate a turbine cut out the maximum speed above which turbine is shut down in order to prevent it from damage rated wind speed rotor diameter swept areas are provided in table 4 the turbine gm 5m has a large swept area of 12868 m2 whereas ve 3m has 9852 m2 the rated capacity is achieved for wind speeds 12 m s 1 for the former turbine and 14 m s 1 for the latter turbine both are available at different hub heights ranging from 80 to 140 m to simplify calculations and exposition a hub height of 80 m a s l was assumed in this study the power curves for the two turbines along with the theoretical power p t are plotted in fig 2 the value c p 59 3 represents the betz efficiency which means the maximum theoretical efficiency of a turbine generator manwell et al 2009 the capacity factor a vital index that describes wind turbine productivity is the ratio of the actual energy to the hypothetical utmost running full time at the rated power it is calculated by eq 5 5 c f annual energy production kwh yr 1 rated power kw 8760 h yr 1 in case of absence of time series of wind data the capacity factor can be modified pimenta et al 2008 as 6 c f annual power production kw rated power kw 3 4 estimation of wind power output the offshore turbines cause wake effects on the leeward side and cause disturbances in the neighbouring turbines in order to avoid the wake losses optimal turbine position has to be adopted nagababu et al 2017a surisetty et al 2016 by selecting suitable downwind d f and crosswind c f spacing factors from the relation 7 array spacing d 2 d f c f where d is the rotor diameter the rotor diameter of ve 3m turbine is 112 m and gm 5m turbine is 128 m for the directional emplacement the downwind and crosswind spacing factors 10 and 5 rotor diameters sheridan et al 2012 are selected in order to avoid inter turbine wake losses yielding an array spacing of 0 627 km2 for the former turbine and 0 819 km2 for the latter turbine depending upon this array spacing the number of wind turbines that can be installed within a specific area can be estimated from the relation 8 number of turbines available area array spacing nameplate wind capacity or total installed capacity is calculated by multiplying the nameplate capacity of a single turbine with a number of turbines to compare renewable energy resources such as offshore wind to conventional generation sources in decision making contexts the average output or aep is more useful than installing nameplate capacity several losses in energy production by an offshore wind power plant are taken into consideration 3 5 co2 eq emission avoidance the clean development mechanism cdm under the kyoto protocol to united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc provides an opportunity for the indian power sector to earn revenue through the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions ghg particularly carbon dioxide co2 central electricity authority 2018b in order to facilitate the adoption of an authentic baseline emissions data and also to ensure uniformity in the calculations of co2 emission reductions by cdm project developers the central electricity authority cea has compiled a database containing the necessary data on co2 emissions for all grid connected power stations in india www cea nic in energy production in india is dominated by coal based followed by gas diesel nuclear and hydro therefore a major source of carbon dioxide emissions in india increased use of renewable energy resources like wind energy or by improving the thermal efficiency of power generation can efficiently reduce co2 emissions the amount of co2 emissions are calculated from all the thermal stations annually from different electricity grid sectors and later combined to a mean value therefore if a renewable energy resource like the wind is utilised the same is expected to be avoided the co2 eq emission avoidance is calculated by central electricity authority 2018b 9 co 2 eq emission avoidance t mwh 0 977 aep mwh this value is used for projecting the emission reductions as well as for calculating the actual emission reductions the energy production from offshore wind power plants could reduce the co2 eq emission into the atmosphere 3 6 calculation of suitable area for offshore wind farms offshore wind farms are generally preferred in the region free of conflicts caused due to nautical hazards shipping zones eco sensitive zones avian and visual impacts sheridan et al 2012 these regions are considered in this study to assess the offshore wind power resource of india in addition there are other regions like naval and military operations fire practising areas submarine cables pipelines offshore oil gas platforms etc which needed to be excluded however due to non access to such sensitive datasets they are not considered in this study 3 6 1 bathymetry and turbine foundation technology bathymetric data plays a critical role in selecting the appropriate turbine foundation technology at a given location in the sea different technologies used vary with water depth is shown in fig 3 water depth in the offshore area has a direct impact on the design construction and cost of turbine installation in the present study bathymetry data has been retrieved from the gebco general bathymetric chart of the oceans with a spatial resolution of a 30 arc second to delineate the regions based on depth advanced jacket and floating foundations are under research development fig 3a shows the bathymetry of the indian coastal region the western coastal region has a wide and gentle continental shelf as compared to the eastern coast the width of the shelf decreases from north to the south gujarat gj is having the largest sea area of 90 646 km2 a qualitative comparison of sea versus land extent helps to realize the extent of available offshore sea area useful for developing offshore wind farms as compared to the onshore wind farms in general larger sea areas with smaller land areas is the potential to develop offshore wind farms excluding the island states goa has the highest sea land ratio 2 97 which could be used to the maximum extent to get benefits from the wind energy however the other factors like wind speed potential exclusion zones are also to be considered overall the west coast of india is having larger areas in the shallow waters 0 50 m depth as compared to the east coast of india this typical feature allows currently viable monopile technology to be deployed over large areas along the western coast i e the shelf regions adjoining gujarat maharashtra and karnataka monopiles are currently by far the most popular solution used worldwide with 75 share in comparison with only 5 for jacket tripod options patel et al 2018 within the area having water depth up to 35 m maximum estimated available area is found along the indian coast the jacket type foundation 35 50 m depth viz tripods quadra pods and lattice structures are commercially available recently but the cost of operation is higher than the monopile structures the deeper foundation technologies like advanced jacket and floating are currently under development stage and therefore can be deployed in future as they become commercially available and at lower costs 3 6 2 potential shipping exclusion there are well designated international shipping lanes in the indian seas the bay of bengal and the arabian sea connecting oman yemen indonesia and srilanka with india the ships plying in the arabian sea cross india through the southern tip closest to kanya kumari via colombo in srilanka and enter the bay of bengal forming an east west straight line along 8on latitude generally these commercial vessels do not randomly disperse and deviate from their designated lanes but tend to follow the shortest route between their port of origin and destination in order to understand the shipping conflict to the offshore wind farm development we utilised international comprehensive ocean atmosphere data set icoads icoads is a global marine surface data archive resource collected and reported by voluntary observing ships vos in this study an improved version of icoads data representing a proxy for global ship traffic has been used wang et al 2007 the black coloured pixels in fig 3 are the ship proxies displayed at 0 1 0 1 grid resolution as can be seen the lanes are quite significant in the study region at the indian ocean scale while a closer examination fig 3b reveals an unclear picture of traffic patterns as the study was carried at large scale the resolution of shipping data is sufficient 3 6 3 visual sea shore exclusion any offshore wind project needed to get clearance for environmental impacts such as social factors a sensitive ecosystem and impacts on endangered animals the visual impact is more of a social factor where the construction of the wind project could potentially decrease tourism revenue a research study by national research council nrc revealed that the wind energy projects create negative impacts on the human health and well being the impacts are experienced mainly by the people who live closer to the wind turbines affected by shadow flicker and noise national research council 2007 wind farms produce low frequency and infrasonic noise which may be audible or inaudible therefore wind farms are generally preferred at least at a distance of eight nautical miles away from the seashore sheridan et al 2012 this exclusion also broadly safeguards potential impacts on marine ecosystems like coral reefs mangroves sensitive fish habitats etc 3 6 4 avian exclusion huge structures of the wind turbines are always dangerous to the migratory birds flying from one country to another as most of the birds tend to follow the coastline one nautical mile wide parallel zone to the coast should be excluded for wind farms constructions sheridan et al 2012 both the avian and visual exclusion zones can be observed in fig 3a and b 3 7 wind economics assessment the robustness of investments in the wind power industry has been improved with time and experience green 2011 the final cost of wind energy production is established by the concept of the levelised cost of energy lcoe technique the lcoe computation considers the overall total installed capital expenditure annual maintenance cost and the annual energy production as key parameters according to the formula heptonstall et al 2012 10 lcoe capex fcr opex aep where capex is the initial capital cost capital expenditure opex is the annual operations and maintenance cost aep is the annual energy production mwh and fcr is the annual fixed charged rate which converts the investment lump sum into an annual payment for e g debt repayment pollack 2013 fcr is calculated using chang 2011 11 fcr r 1 r t 1 r t 1 where r is the discount rate and t is the project s economic life span in years in this study 12 annual discounted rate r is adopted mani and dhingra 2013 nagababu et al 2017b and project lifetime t as twenty years cavazzi and dutton 2016 hong and möller 2011 möller et al 2012 3 7 1 capex estimation the main components of capex vary in their proportion of costs heptonstall et al 2012 the offshore development is dominated by the foundation and electrical infrastructure costs which make up a larger proportion of the total capex the deeper and farther from the coast the higher is the cost the investment costs comprise of a fixed component including turbine cost and a variable component foundation grid connection and installation costs depending upon the depth and distance from the coast total investment cost equals to the summation of the capital cost of each item as suggested by hong and möller 2011 dicorato et al 2011 and möller et al 2012 12 capex c wt c found c e c b where c wt is the cost of the wind turbine c found is the cost of the foundation c e is the cost of electricity transmission and c b is the cost of balance of the system the cost of the turbine is dependent on design and specifications as well as approximations of variable external factors like currency exchange discount rates steel prices etc heptonstall et al 2012 jones et al 2014 the turbine cost for 3 mw and 5 mw has been estimated in euros 1 79 76 as on september 8 2019 is derived based on the existing projects as reported by offshore design engineering limited 2007 13 c wt mw 2 95 10 6 ln p wt 375200 where p wt is the rated capacity of each wind turbine offshore wind turbines cost high of the order 1 6 2 1 million per mw hdidouan and staffell 2017 heptonstall et al 2012 due to the increased difficulty in manufacturing transporting and erecting turbines green 2011 an increase of 10 of the basic commercial cost of the wind turbine is assumed for installation and transportation costs dicorato et al 2011 the foundation cost c found is depth dependent with a complex relationship accounting for the applicability of different foundation technologies this has been expressed in the form of a simple linear relationship estimated by eq 14 following hdidouan and staffell 2017 14 c found mw 10900 d 404500 for d 30 m 14100 d 314900 for d 30 m where d is the water depth the unit cost of electrical connection per mw is dependent on the distance of the wind farm from the coast currently high voltage alternating current hvac cables are used to link offshore turbines to an offshore substation due to its existing large scale developments and low development risks as compared to the hv direct current hvdc wind turbines typically generate power at 1 kv ac voltage which is steps up to either 11 kv or 33 kv later the power is transmitted to an offshore substation which then increases the transmission voltage the shore this would be connected directly to the electricity grid or stepped up further to 400 kv at an onshore substation in this study the shortest distance to the selected grid point of each site from the coastline was considered as subsea cable length d s and the shortest distance to the coastline from the high voltage grid was considered as land cable length d l hong and möller 2011 kim et al 2013 the unit cost of connection c e in per installed mw is then given by 15 c e mw 0 38 d s 0 4 d l 76 60 10 6 200 according to some studies the turbine cost foundation cost electrical transmission cost and their installations share around 90 of the total investment cost so the balance cost would be no more than 10 of the investment cost and the same is considered in this study 3 7 2 opex estimation the operation and maintenance costs are highly dependent on the distance of wind farm from the nearest port the port fees and a fixed cost of maintenance generally the shortest distance from the port with adequate tonnage capacity is essential for the installation as well as operations and maintenance the cost function considering all these factors is expressed as 16 opex c fix c port d p c var 100 where c fix is the fixed cost of maintenance assumed as 20 per mwh c port is the port fees activities taken as 3 7 per mwh d p is the distance of wind farm from the nearest port and c var is the variable cost taken as 6 7 per 100 km cavazzi and dutton 2016 at the end of the wind farm operating life decommissioning costs apply however as there may be a residual value associated with the wind farm assets by selling or reusing the same in the event of repowering in this work the impact of decommissioning is assumed neutral to the overall lcoe 4 results and discussion 4 1 comparison of combined scatterometer data firstly a linear regression analysis has been conducted on individual scatterometer datasets with the co located buoys and the coefficients have been applied on the scatterometer and re processed for the whole mission period refer surisetty et al 2019 later merging was done by collecting samples from each satellite using a regular grid of 0 125 12 5 km the data at the buoys rm07 rm08 rm09 ad07 and bd08 have been extracted from the combined merged dataset by using spatial interpolation although there are many buoys available in the study region the amount of data is less for statistical comparison an extensive comparison of four scatterometers and combined scatterometer data with the offshore met buoys was carried out in surisetty et al 2019 as the present study is focused on the wind resource assessment comparative analysis from only few buoys is discussed in this section a logarithmic wind profile assumption was used to extrapolate the buoy winds from 3 m to 10 m height to get the neutrally stable winds in order to compare with the scatterometer winds the error metrics of the combined scatterometer dataset are presented in table 5 the combined dataset showed a mean bias in the wind speed with the range of 0 07 0 14 m s 1 with a very small absolute deviation of around 1 2 2 6 the rmse was low of the order 0 88 m s 1 at rm09 as compared to rm07 and rm08 lesser variability in the winds as revealed by the lesser stde and mae values at rm09 is one of the prime factors for the reduced rmse value similarly the wind power density also showed small absolute deviation that varies from 1 4 to 3 6 with the combined dataset this affects the computation of power production from the turbines with better accuracies the combined data set is very close to the in situ observations and makes it suitable for analyzing the wind energy potential in the study region as the number of collocated wind data at ad07 and bd08 is less the statistics resulting from its comparison with the combined scatterometer dataset is doubtful therefore ignored in the study on the other hand as rm07 rm08 and rm09 are having more than 10 years of in situ data covering all the scatterometers life span thus the resulting error metrics are acceptable 4 2 analysis of wind resource in this section the geographical distribution of wind resource over the north indian ocean is discussed wind resource statistics for the study region are presented in the form of individual maps for each scatterometer as well as the combined form fig 4 shows the number of overlapping data from quikscat oscat ascat a and ascat b scatterometers out of all scatterometers more data is available from the quikscat due to its longer mission period oscat s data coverage is more in the mid arabian sea and in the bay of bengal ascat b has relatively lesser data volume as compared to the ascat a it is evident that the combined data resulted in inhomogeneous data coverage in the spatial domain fig 4e the majority of the 0 125 degree grids are sampled more than 75 of the total period the central arabian sea and the bay of bengal have more than 80 of coverage whereas the coastal regions surrounding the indian mainland and island states have less than 20 of data due to fewer scatterometer measurements the regions covering gulf of mannar north srilanka gulf of kutch and gulf of khambat also have inadequate measurements and thus not acceptable for analysis 4 2 1 wind climate variability india is known for its seasonal variability with four seasons namely winter december january february pre march april may summer june july august september and post october november monsoons seasonal comparison of the winds is very useful for power planning and helpful for the wind farm operators to choose an alternative source in case of winds are very low or very high fig 5 and fig 6 show the synergetic seasonal and annual mean maps of wind speed and wind power density respectively at 80 m hub height the mean annual wind speed at 80 m hub height ranges around 7 m s 1 in the open seas and around 5 6 m s 1 along the indian coastal regions fig 5 the western arabian sea is showing higher mean annual wind speed of around 6 5 8 m s 1 whereas the higher mean annual wind power density 450 550 w m 2 is confined to the region between 6 and 18on latitude and up to 70oe longitude in the bay of bengal region relatively lesser wind power density is observed at around 300 400 w m 2 the southeastern arabian sea shows lesser wind power density of 150 200 w m 2 in particular along kerala and karnataka coasts the highest mean annual wind speed wind power density is observed in the southern parts of tamil nadu reaching values up to 8 5 m s 1 550 w m 2 regarding seasonal analysis the mean offshore wind speed reaches to the maximum to 8 10 m s 1 during the summer monsoon shown in fig 5c particularly in the western and central arabian sea and the central bay of bengal this is due to the prevailing south west monsoon season during the winter monsoon mean wind speed values reach close to 9 m s 1 in the gulf of mannar region southern tip of india relatively strong winds are observed in the central bay of bengal and the central arabian sea close to 7 m s 1 during pre monsoon season winds along the coastal region increase slightly close to 7 m s 1 especially along the gujarat coast and odisha coast whereas in post monsoon wind pattern is similar to that of summer monsoon but with weaker strength fig 7 shows the main variability characteristics of wind speed at 10 m height namely the variability within each year i e mean annual variability mav and the variability from year to year i e inter annual variability iav computed from eqs 1 and 2 the regions in the northern bay of bengal south eastern arabian sea are characterised with mav of 45 highest mav 55 60 is observed in the western arabian sea and the regions surrounding indonesia on the other hand the winds near the southern tip of india surrounding gulf of mannar is not only high but also stable mav 30 enough throughout the year the iav seems to be low for the entire north indian ocean 6 it is common practice in the wind industry to consider the regions having iav around 6 watson 2014 iav is considered as an important parameter in wind energy economics low iav of 4 is observed along the gujarat kerala and south tamil nadu coasts comparing mav iav mean annual wind speed and wind power density the most promising areas coincide for each analysis are south tamil nadu and gujarat coasts furthermore it is to be noted that even after applying the quality flags for all the scatterometer data we have noticed some common artefacts in the satellite winds for example there are many offshore rigs in the bombay high region off mumbai in maharashtra the associated structures at sea may cause corner reflections in radar backscatter data from ascat quikscat hasager et al 2015 and oscat moreover very high backscatter from the ships plying in the international routes especially along the region from southern srilanka to northern indonesia is clearly noticed in the maps in the form of enhanced winds figs 5 and 6 as many ships move along this route they cause ship wakes which cause a misinterpretation of high winds in addition to this corner reflections from the ships also produce high backscatter oscat seems to be more sensitive to the ship effects and ascat is less sensitive to it the study utilises the l2b products no corrections to the moving or stationary targets were applied as it is out of the scope of this study the top panels of fig 8 shows the ve 3m and gm 5m turbines mean power outputs computed from the power curves see fig 2 it represents the average power that would be produced if turbines were placed at that point the plot shows that the southern continental shelf between longitudes 77oe and 80oe latitudes 7on and 9on of the stretch from dhanushkodi to kanya kumari is having the very good potential for wind power development the average power was used in this work rather than yearly energy as it is easier to compare the output with the rated capacity around dhanushkodi an average production of 1600 kw 2200 kw is expected from ve 3m gm 5m turbine very high average power production of 2000 kw is expected along the regions of kolachel and tuticorin with a capacity factor of 0 4 fig 8 these results are comparable with the recent works by nagababu et al 2017a 2016 along the east coast of india an average production of 1000 1200 kw is expected from ve 3m and 1200 1600 kw from the gm 5m turbine however the west coast of india is showing reasonably lesser wind production capability especially along the kerala and karnataka coasts of approximately 500 kw some stretches of maharashtra and gujarat show a production capability of 1200 1500 kw however the availability of wider continental shelf of more than 500 km in gujarat and 300 km in maharashtra and shallower waters of 50 m makes these regions favourable for wind farm installations with viable fixed platform technology monopile a proposal for the development of an offshore wind farm of the capacity of 1000 mw was called by the government of india in the coastal waters off gujarat teri 2015 4 3 comprehensive assessment of wind resource from fig 8 it is clearly understood that many coastal states of india are having the capacity factors 0 3 excepting the regions of kerala there are no detailed studies available in the literature on total wind power potential around each indian coastal state in this section the offshore wind energy resource that can be tapped in the offshore waters of each coastal state within the indian eez will be discussed by considering several factors like bathymetry conflict areas and exclusion zones bathymetry plays a crucial role in selecting the appropriate turbine foundation technology fig 3 represents the turbine foundation technology map derived from the general bathymetric chart of the oceans gebco used for various ranges of water depths within the indian eez for example the monopile foundation is suitable for the depths up to 35 m and floating type of turbines are suitable for the depths greater than 100 m the choice of water depths and the distance from the coast have a direct impact on the design construction maintenance and cost of the turbine and in turn on the cost of power production at present the monopile type of foundation is most viable in terms of economic feasibility the wind classes range between 2 and 3 surrounding the western coastal states gujarat karnataka and maharashtra and along with the eastern coastal states andhra pradesh odisha and west bengal tamil nadu falls under higher wind class category between 4 and 7 fig 9 4 3 1 along shelf seasonal variability to understand the along shelf seasonal variability in the winds we have extracted around 457 grid points along the 50 m depth contour line from the gujarat west coast to the west bengal east coast the seasonal averages of wind speed power density turbine outputs from ve 3m and gm 5m offshore turbines have been computed and shown in fig 10 higher and consistent winds are found in the coastal sector 220 250 of tamil nadu tn this region has small seasonal variability having wind density ranges from 400 to 600 w m 2 in contrast substantial seasonal variability is observed for odisha west bengal coasts gujarat coast also shows slightly lesser seasonal variability in the winds winds are almost constant along kerala coast with speeds around 6 m s 1 and density around 200 w m 2 the southern sector of andhra pradesh coast shows lesser seasonal variability as compared to the northern sector the turbine power output from ve 3m gm 5m turbine ranges from 1200 kw to 2300 kw 1800 3200 kw near tuticorin tn stands the highest in the indian coastal region the regions surrounding porbandar gj is having a higher potential of 1500 kw during the summer season only although higher winds exist the availability of shelf area the presence of ship traffic sensitive marine ecosystems could limit the development of wind farms as discussed in section 3 6 4 3 2 state wise wind resource distribution there are nine coastal states along the indian mainland and two island states each one in the arabian sea and the bay of bengal table 6 can be used to compare different development options for different depth ranges for each indian coastal state the depth ranges are classified according to the turbine foundation technology sheridan et al 2012 where the depth range from 0 to 35 m suits for monopile foundation and 100 1000 m for the floating technology of all the states gujarat is having a wider continental shelf of area 32 065 km2 up to 35 m depth totalling to around 90 646 km2 area this allows nearly around 1 44 525 ve 3m turbines or 1 10 652 gm 5m turbines this would produce an overall nameplate power output of 433 57 gw 3798 twh yr 1 from ve 3m or 553 26 gw 4847 twh yr 1 from gm 5m turbines using commercially viable and proven technology in shallow waters up to 35 m depth there is a power potential of 153 37 gw 1343 twh yr 1 from ve 3m or 195 71 gw 1714 twh yr 1 from gm 5m turbines however the actual power production would be much lesser considering the power curve generator efficiency swept area wind distribution wake effects capacity factor etc the maps of power production include all the above mentioned effects therefore power production from each pixel of 1 1 km2 grid spacing was added to get an average power production instead of considering constant capacity factor multiplied by nameplate capacity as mentioned in sheridan et al 2012 from fig 8 it can be clearly observed that the capacity factor is varying spatially and for different turbines therefore considering constant capacity factor could lead to an overestimation of power production in certain regions having lower wind energy finally it has been estimated that the ve 3m can produce 99 49 gw 871 twh yr 1 power and gm 5m can produce 140 65 gw 1232 twh yr 1 in the gujarat state the state s electrical requirement for the financial year fy 2017 18 is 111 66 twh yr 1 central electricity authority 2018c which is already available from the alternate resources switching over from the conventional resource to wind resource would help in reducing the carbon emissions co2 by around 851 million tons with ve 3m turbines or 1204 million tons with gm 5m turbines if the entire available sea area before exclusion are utilised a carbon emission factor of 0 977 tons per mwh is considered in this study central electricity authority 2018b in decision making contexts it is often necessary to consider potential conflict and exclusion regions in the wind resource assessment in general a visual exclusion zone of 8 nautical miles and an avian exclusion zone of 1 nautical mile from the shore are considered as exclusion zones where no wind farm development is allowed fig 3 in addition regions that could conflict commercial shipping should also be avoided considering all the three factors around 20 of the available shelf area 19017 km2 needed to be avoided for the gujarat coast if fully developed up to 1000 m depth gujarat offshore region has a potential to generate 76 96 gw ve 3m or 108 72 gw gm 5m which translates to around 674 twh yr 1 or 952 twh yr 1 ranking 1 of all the indian coastal states this would reduce the carbon emissions by around 658 million tons with ve 3m and 930 million tons with gm 5m turbines although the winds are relatively weak compared to tamil nadu coastal region the availability of more shelf region benefits gujarat state for wind farm developments maharashtra shared almost equal wind potential capability as tamil nadu and ranked 3 in the case of tamil nadu wind energy is very high as compared to all coastal states the presence of international shipping route along the southern tamil nadu coast narrow continental shelf the proximity to sri lanka and the presence of sensitive ecosystems restricted its rank to no 4 for wind farm developments around 36 of available shelf area becomes unsuitable for wind farm development due to shipping conflict visual and avian exclusion despite having higher wind potential the eez is just only 20 nautical miles as compared to 200 nm by definition and the 1000 m depth contour exists just within 10 nautical miles still there is very good potential of 45 60 gw 400 twh yr 1 or 64 39 gw 564 twh yr 1 from ve 3m or gm 5m turbines respectively after considering the total excluded region lakshadweep has the lowest rank due to lesser shelf availability and weaker winds in contrast the andaman and nicobar islands has more shelf area between 100 and 1000 m depth of around 51 488 km2 if this area is properly utilised there is a potential of 72 47 gw 634 twh yr 1 or 102 67 gw 900 twh yr 1 from ve 3m or gm 5m turbines however due to frequent earthquakes volcanic eruptions in this island state the present viable monopile technology would not be a feasible solution for long term investments in the wind industry however the developing floating turbine technology would benefit this small island for power production and may support exporting power to the neighbouring asian countries the full results for all the coastal states are presented in table 6 the energy requirement and the available energy values for each coastal state for the year 2017 18 central electricity authority 2018c is given in table 7 it can be seen that almost all the coastal states already have enough energy capability excepting few states like kerala tamil nadu odisha and andaman and the nicobar islands however more than three fourths of all the electricity produced is being generated from the conventional and non renewable sources like coal gas diesel etc this produces millions of tons of harmful carbon emissions which lead to direct and indirect health hazards environmental impacts etc switching to clean renewable resources like the wind in this case can help in reducing 3117 with ve 3m or 4417 with gm 5m million tons of co2 emissions every year table 7 if properly planned and executed offshore renewable energy policy many states of india could be benefited in terms of reduction in carbon emissions and more economic growth if at least 10 of the calculated power generation is utilised more than half of the energy requirement of each coastal state can be met given the available area after exclusions and conflict regions of around 22 area india has the potential to install almost 5 75 301 ve 3m or 4 40 465 gm 5m turbines in the shelf region up to 1000 m depth within the eez region this would produce a net power production of 364 21 gw 3190 twh yr 1 or 516 17 gw 4522 twh yr 1 from ve 3m or gm 5m offshore wind turbines this would reduce overall carbon emissions of 3117 and 4418 million tons respectively the energy requirement for the fy 2017 18 is 1337 twh yr 1 and the anticipated power requirement for the fy 2021 22 is to be 1904 twh yr 1 central electricity authority 2019 the total production capacity is therefore 2 4 3 4 times using ve 3m gm 5m more than the energy requirements of fy 2017 18 and 1 6 2 4 times more for the future requirement if utilised to the maximum extent as india is growing in the offshore wind farm industry innovative integration solutions such as load balancing in electrical vehicles through vehicle to grid v2g interconnectivity between the wind projects advanced power storage capacities submarine electrical transmission lines etc are to be prioritized in order to attract the national and international market the present analysis would help in framing the policies and strategic planning for economic viability by categorising the zones for practical wind farm developments in the country 4 4 economic analysis from the above analysis it is clear that gujarat and tamil nadu offshore regions have good potential for wind farms previous studies by fowi reported that zone a as most promising offshore wind development area in gujarat and tamil nadu regions see fig 11 for more details the reader is suggested to refer to the reports fowind 2018 in a latest study on concept design for a demonstration project of 150 504 mw in tamil nadu and gujarat a sub zone a3 out of 19 sub zones in gj and out of 10 sub zones in tn see fig 12 has been suggested to be an optimum site due to its proximity to the coast depth and various other factors table 8 shows key parameters such as mean annual wind speed mean annual technical power production from ve 3m and gm 5m the distance of the site from the coast port and distance of electrical grid respectively at the above site in gujarat the sub zone a3 is located at around 14 km from the pipvav port between rajula and diu cities whereas in tamil nadu the a3 sub zone is location at around 28 km from the tuticorin port in this work we have calculated levelised cost of energy lcoe in mwh considering ve 3m and gm 5m turbines a3 sub zone table 9 shows the mean annual technical energy production at 80 m from ve 3m and gm 5m after considering the losses due to availability wake etc out of the two sites tamil nadu site having 5 mw turbine and monopile depth 30 m foundation technology shows the lowest lcoe of 106 87 mwh suggesting an optimum site for wind farm development it is due to the highest annual mean wind speed and technical wind power production on the other hand gujarat region with 5 mw turbine shows lcoe of 146 48 mwh although winds are relatively weaker in this region the wind farm is affordable at this site due to its close proximity to the port very shallow waters that reduces the operational and maintenance costs to many folds these numbers are broadly in line with earlier studies alluri et al 2017 fowind 2018 nagababu et al 2017a 4 4 1 model sensitivity the cost of offshore wind power generation increases with an increase in the investment cost and decreases in the wind energy potential in order to understand this impact on lcoe six parameters were altered systematically to test the model sensitivity interest rate 2 the lifetime of the wind farm 5 years availability 5 capex 5 annual energy production 5 the sensitivity of lcoe to interest rate is greatest with 2 increase or decrease in value resulting a change of 44 and 30 mwh for ve 3m and gm 5m respectively at gujarat site fig 12 a b and a change of 30 and 20 mwh for ve 3m and gm 5m respectively at tamil nadu site fig 12 c d lcoe has a positive impact when the interest rate is reduced shortening the lifetime of the wind farm to 15 years will add around 17 and 11 mwh in gujarat and 12 and 8 mwh in tamil nadu to the energy cost although it is not recommended to consider shorter than the design life it would give a general idea of cost risk in case of early failure of the wind farm on the other hand lengthening the lifetime to 25 years will have a proportionately smaller advantage the cost of power generation showed an increase with an increase in capex and decrease in wind energy potential the energy potential aep has a much bigger effect on the lcoe after the interest rate lower aep has a bigger impact by increasing the lcoe by 19 and 13 mwh with 3 mw turbines and by 13 and 9 mwh with 5 mw turbines respectively therefore it is clear that the selection of an optimum site is sensitive to many parameters and assumptions in addition to these assumptions there are some possible ways of reducing lcoe by improving the foundation technology more efficient turbines and by reducing transmission losses with advanced high voltage direct current hvdc this would lead to capital cost reduction and reduction in energy losses over the long distance transmission increasing turbine size and power rating with further have a good impact on the installation cost 5 conclusions the present study provided a detailed assessment of offshore wind power resource in the indian eez including lakshadweep and andaman nicobar islands based on the synergetic use of multiple scatterometers data the results indicate that offshore wind resource is sufficient to support the nation s present and future electric power requirement this study compared quikscat oscat ascat a and ascat b scatterometers with measured offshore winds from met buoys and adjusted the scatterometers data in order to provide better offshore wind power production estimates the following points are noteworthy to be concluded in the study the synergetic approach of combining different scatterometers data proved advantageous in terms of the increased number of samples the inclusion of diurnal variations of winds and reduced statistical uncertainty in the southern parts of tamil nadu the offshore region between 7 9on and 77 80oe the mean wind speed reaches around 8 10 m s 1 and the power density to around 500 w m 2 highest as compared to other regions of the country this region could be one of the promising sites for wind farm installations very high average power production of 2000 kw is expected along the regions of kolachel and tuticorin with a capacity factor of 0 4 higher and consistent winds are found along the southern tamil nadu tn with small seasonal variability having wind density ranges from 400 to 600 w m 2 gujarat ranks 1 due to the availability of wider shelf area 71629 km2 capable to install 1 14 204 v112 3m and 87 438 g128 5m offshore turbines with a nameplate capacity of 342 61 gw and 437 19 gw power production based on the availability on the wind potential and turbine properties the actual power production would be 76 96 gw 674 twh yr 1 and 108 72 gw 952 twh yr 1 after subtracting the exclusion zones and conflict areas although andaman and nicobar islands have good potential after gujarat the proximity to volcanoes frequent earthquakes and availability of more shelf area beyond 100 m depth suitable for floating turbine technology makes it not viable for the wind farm industry however there is a good scope in future for this region once the technology is fully matured close proximity to sri lanka international shipping route availability of lesser shelf area makes tamil nadu as the second choice for wind farm development albeit higher wind speed availability than other regions on the other hand the majority of kerala coastal region and some coastal stretches of karnataka are having a very less wind power density of less than 150 w m 2 less feasible for the wind farm industry given the available area after exclusions and conflict regions of around 22 area and the turbine spacing india has a net power production of 364 gw 3190 twh yr 1 for v112 3m or 516 gw 4521 twh yr 1 for g128 5m turbines this would reduce overall carbon emissions of 3117 and 4418 million tons per year respectively the power so generated can suffice 2 4 3 4 times of india s anticipated electricity demand for the fy 2017 18 and 1 6 2 4 times of future demand for the fy 2021 22 with v112 3m g128 5m turbines out of the two a3 subzones in gujarat and tamil nadu the latter site with 5 mw turbine and monopile depth 30 m foundation technology shows the lowest lcoe of 106 87 mwh suggesting an optimum site for wind farm development sensitivity analysis shows that for a capital intensive investment in an offshore wind farm the interest rate is a critical parameter in determining the cost of output energy the cost of power generation showed an increase with an increase in capex and decrease in wind energy potential author contribution statement surisetty v v arun kumar conceptualization software validation writing original draft data curation writing

22179,the synergetic offshore wind dataset derived from a combination of scatterometers quikscat oscat and ascat a b have been utilised and validated with available buoy data it is observed that the mean deviation in wind speed between the co located buoy and synergetic scatterometer data is small of the order 2 and the power density showed a difference of 2 5 the combined synergetic maps of wind speed wind power density and practical power production from two offshore wind turbines v112 3m and g128 5m have been analysed and evaluated on a seasonal and annual basis further considering the available area after exclusions conflict regions due to shipping visual and avian exclusions india has a net power production of 364 gw 3190 twh yr for v112 3m and 516 gw 4522 twh yr for g128 5m turbines at 80 m hub height this would reduce overall carbon emissions of 3117 and 4418 million tons respectively per year finally the levelised cost of energy is computed for two optimum sites in shallow waters off gujarat and tamil nadu coasts and found to be lowest of around 106 87 mwh in tamil nadu site suggesting an optimum site for wind farm development keywords wind energy resource offshore wind scatterometer india 1 introduction global warming over millennial time scales is caused due to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions produced by several human activities dietz et al 2016 snyder 2016 the coastal regions of most of the countries have been heavily exploited in terms of industrialisation and urbanisation due to its close proximity to several natural resources as a result the energy requirement has been increased to several folds with the exhaustion of fossil fuels and increasing awareness on environmental issues harnessing energy from available resources has become a prime focus in developing countries many countries have realized that the exploitation of new and renewable energy resources is the only solution to suffice the ever growing demand for electricity buonocore et al 2016 among the renewable resources wind power is a very large energy source with proven commercial technology and very low or negligible co2 emissions archer and jacobson 2005 as of july 2018 india ranks third largest power generation capacity in the world with about 345 5 gw and third largest consumer of electricity central electricity authority 2018a there are no offshore wind farms installed in the country as on today the latest national offshore wind energy policy 2015 boosts the development of offshore wind farms within the indian exclusive economic zone eez the first offshore wind project of india fowpi with the capacity of 200 mw has been initiated in the coastal waters off gujarat fowind 2015 with the utilization of onshore and the upcoming offshore wind farms the government of india has set a target to achieve 60 gw power generation capacities by 2022 and reduction in carbon emissions by 33 35 of its gdp by 2030 government of india 2015 the technologies and fuel sources india adopts as it adds this electricity generation capacity may make a significant impact on global resource usage and environmental issues generally wind energy potential for a particular region is estimated from long term data collected from meteorological stations sheridan et al 2012 however there are very limited offshore met buoys that have long term data existing for the country within the eez fig 1 which limits the assessment of wind power potential in both space and time the wind energy is directly proportional to the cube of the wind speed a small error in the wind speed measurement could result in large deviations in the wind energy estimations carvalho et al 2014 hasager et al 2015 therefore accurate wind datasets are required for this purpose the other sources of in situ data are from light detection and ranging lidar and sound detection and ranging sodar hasager et al 2008 but they are limited to a particular region and are not readily available there are several alternatives for the in situ offshore wind measurements like satellite remote sensing scatterometers synthetic aperture radars etc numerical weather prediction nwp models blended and reanalyzed winds each dataset has its own limitations and strengths balog et al 2016 karagali et al 2012 sharp et al 2015 soukissian and papadopoulos 2015 most of the offshore wind power assessments have been carried out at a coarser spatial resolution scatterometer data of 25 50 km by various researchers earlier gadad and deka 2016 guo et al 2018 jiang et al 2013 karagali et al 2012 karamanis et al 2011 nagababu et al 2015 pimenta et al 2008 remmers et al 2019 which limits the evaluation near the coastal region due to land contamination in the data some researchers have used blended winds derived from multiple scatterometers radiometers and reanalysis data carvalho et al 2016 soukissian and papadopoulos 2015 in addition mostly the assessments were confined to a single or dual scatterometer only refer to table 1 all the earlier work on the assessment of offshore wind resources of india were confined to an overall potential using different data sources like model reanalysis nagababu et al 2017b a single scatterometer data gadad and deka 2016 and are limited to a specific period of time a detailed comprehensive assessment of offshore wind power potential using long term synergetic scatterometers data has not been attempted so far a study on the assessment of offshore wind resource in india using multiple scatterometers surisetty et al 2019 2016 and risat 1 sar was carried out surisetty et al 2016 however the study lacks the comparison and adjustment of scatterometers data the major objective of the present study is to provide a detailed comprehensive assessment of offshore wind energy utilize the synergetic combined scatterometer data of quikscat oscat ascat a and ascat b at 12 5 km spatial resolution a comparison of combined scatterometer wind speed data has been done with offshore met buoys further various wind and power parameters have been assessed by considering bathymetry and conflict zones such as shipping lanes visual and avian zones at last the total amount of carbon emissions that can be reduced effectively using offshore wind energy exploration is evaluated fig 1 shows the major electricity usage centres of india inferred from a sky night brightness image signifying the importance of the study the regions of gujarat gj maharashtra mh tamil nadu tn some parts of andhra pradesh ap odisha od and west bengal wb are the most populated centres of indian coastal region having a heavy electrical load hence offshore wind resource would suffice the present and future needs of these coastal states and the surplus power can be easily transported to the neighboaring states 2 data acquisition 2 1 scatterometer wind data seawinds on board quikscat is a ku band 13 4 ghz scatterometer launched by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa in june 1999 it has a swath of around 1800 km wide in a sun synchronous orbit and mapped around 90 of the world ocean two times a day this mission has almost 10 years of data 1999 2009 one of the longest wind records with varying spatial resolutions of 12 5 25 and 50 km the ocean scatterometer oscat with a similar configuration as quikscat has launched on board the oceansat 2 satellite by the indian space research organisation isro in september 2009 it filled the data gap due to the eventual loss of the quikscat satellite the swath retrievals are provided at 12 5 25 and 50 km pixel resolution following a sun synchronous near circular orbit ascat a is an advanced scatterometer the first c band 5 26 ghz scatterometer launched in late 2006 on board the first version of the meteorological operational satellite metop a through a joint collaboration between the european space agency esa and the european organisation for the exploitation of meteorological satellites eumetsat ascat a provided data at two spatial resolutions 25 km and 12 5 km over the global oceans and a 12 5 km resolution data for coastal regions this coastal product contains wind product close to 15 km from the coast while the standard 12 5 km product shows a 35 km land mask ascat b is the follow on mission of ascat a launched in september 2012 on board metop b satellite metop b is in a co planar orbit and nearly half an orbit out of phase with metop a the main characteristics of the scatterometers spatial resolution time of pass and the data coverage are given in table 2 all the 12 5 km data have been downloaded from nasa s jet propulsion laboratory physical oceanography distributed active archive centre jpl po daac website https podaac jpl nasa gov all satellite derived wind data were subjected to thorough quality control where all records flagged with poor quality such as data having the presence of rain land pixels or not monitored were discarded from the analysis 2 1 1 generation of combined scatterometer data the equatorial time of crossing for ascending descending passes of quikscat oscat and ascat are 06 00 18 00 12 00 00 00 and 21 30 09 30 hours respectively the obvious advantages of the synergetic approach of utilising multiple scatterometers are i increase in the number of overlapping samples decreases the statistical uncertainty and ii different scatterometers have different overpass times thus at any location over the sea more diurnal variations can be included in the analysis hasager et al 2015 the data would be more appropriate along the coastal regions where such variations in winds are observed therefore we can get more coverage of wind if we consider all the scatterometers data this increases the accuracy of the offshore wind resource assessment the merging was done by collecting samples from each satellite and applying spatial averaging of all the data points centered at a regular grid of 0 125 12 5 km hasager et al 2015 the errors associated with each scatterometer have been estimated with respect to the offshore wind buoys and the wind speeds have been adjusted using coefficients derived from linear regression technique refer table 2 in surisetty et al 2019 monthly fields were generated by averaging the daily fields seventeen year climatological monthly means were computed using the data from january 2000 december 2016 for each 12 5 km grid cell statistics of wind speed wind power density and power production at 10 m height and 80 m hub height was computed 2 2 in situ wind data in situ wind measurements from the offshore meteorological buoys were obtained from the research moored array for african asian australian monsoon analysis and prediction rama buoys and from the indian national centre for ocean information services incois buoys with ad bd and cb name tags the locations of the aforementioned buoys buoy id position distance to the nearest coast data coverage are provided in fig 1 and table 3 as evident from the table many of the buoys have less than 5 years of data the uncertainty of the statistical estimates increases as the available sample sizes decrease hasager et al 2015 soukissian et al 2017 therefore statistics from a long time series of in situ data versus combined synergetic scatterometer data sets have to be considered the measured data were available at 10 min interval and at a 10 m height above mean sea level m s l and were temporally interpolated according to the availability of scatterometer time of passes in addition measured wind data at different heights viz 10 m 50 m 80 m 100 m and 102 m from an onshore mast installed at dhanushkodi 9 10 4 78 n 79 25 44 29 e tamil nadu were obtained from the national institute of wind energy niwe 3 methods 3 1 wind speed variability it is important to consider the variability of wind speed in wind climate analysis and wind energy applications soukissian et al 2017 there are two parameters namely the mean annual mav and inter annual variability iav of wind speed which is generally considered for identifying a suitable site for wind farms mav is a measure of variability within each year and depicts the seasonal differences in wind behavior the mean annual variability denoted as mav is expressed as the mean value of the ratio of standard deviation per year to the mean value of wind speed per year for the time period under consideration and is estimated by 1 mav 1 j j 1 j s u j m u j 1 j j 1 j cv j cv where s u j m u j and cv j denote the standard deviation mean value and the coefficient of variation of wind speed for the year j j 1 2 j respectively cv represents the mean annual value of the coefficient of variation and j is the total length of the data in years inter annual variability denoted as iav is defined as the ratio of the standard deviation of the annual mean wind speed m u j j 1 2 j represented by s m u j to the overall mean of wind speed i e m u given by 2 iav s m u j m u 3 2 extrapolation of wind speed as the scatterometer derived winds are at 10 m above the sea surface the logarithmic wind profile was used to extrapolate the measured winds to hub height h assuming the neutral stability of the atmosphere and a surface roughness of z 0 0 2 mm recommended as an average value for calm and open seas manwell et al 2009 according to the log law the velocity v h at a given height h is 3 v h v 10 log h z 0 log 10 z 0 where v 10 is the wind speed at height 10 m above the sea level 3 3 wind power density and wind energy wind power density e represents the flow of kinetic energy per unit associated with the wind given in units of watts per square meter w m 2 as 4 e 1 2 ρ v 3 for simplification in the computation a constant air density ρ 1 225 kg m 3 was used the power density is an expedient measure as it is independent of turbine characteristics generally the actual power production expected from a wind turbine depends on several factors like the efficiency of the rotor generator flow mechanics of the blades etc theoretical power production can be estimated using eac p where a is the turbine swept area and c p is the efficiency the power generated by a turbine is represented by the power curve normally provided by the turbine manufacturer considering mechanics of the flow passing through the blades and the efficiency of the rotor generator fig 2 shows the power curves p t v and table 4 shows the characteristics of two turbines vestas v112 3 mw ve 3m here after and gamesa g128 5 mw gm 5m here after used in this study the selection of turbines is completely hypothetical offshore projects require the use of the powerful wind turbines on the market and in general 3 mw and 5 mw turbines are commonly used the data has been obtained from the manufacturers of the respective turbines source https wind turbine models com their characteristics such as cut in the minimum speed required to operate a turbine cut out the maximum speed above which turbine is shut down in order to prevent it from damage rated wind speed rotor diameter swept areas are provided in table 4 the turbine gm 5m has a large swept area of 12868 m2 whereas ve 3m has 9852 m2 the rated capacity is achieved for wind speeds 12 m s 1 for the former turbine and 14 m s 1 for the latter turbine both are available at different hub heights ranging from 80 to 140 m to simplify calculations and exposition a hub height of 80 m a s l was assumed in this study the power curves for the two turbines along with the theoretical power p t are plotted in fig 2 the value c p 59 3 represents the betz efficiency which means the maximum theoretical efficiency of a turbine generator manwell et al 2009 the capacity factor a vital index that describes wind turbine productivity is the ratio of the actual energy to the hypothetical utmost running full time at the rated power it is calculated by eq 5 5 c f annual energy production kwh yr 1 rated power kw 8760 h yr 1 in case of absence of time series of wind data the capacity factor can be modified pimenta et al 2008 as 6 c f annual power production kw rated power kw 3 4 estimation of wind power output the offshore turbines cause wake effects on the leeward side and cause disturbances in the neighbouring turbines in order to avoid the wake losses optimal turbine position has to be adopted nagababu et al 2017a surisetty et al 2016 by selecting suitable downwind d f and crosswind c f spacing factors from the relation 7 array spacing d 2 d f c f where d is the rotor diameter the rotor diameter of ve 3m turbine is 112 m and gm 5m turbine is 128 m for the directional emplacement the downwind and crosswind spacing factors 10 and 5 rotor diameters sheridan et al 2012 are selected in order to avoid inter turbine wake losses yielding an array spacing of 0 627 km2 for the former turbine and 0 819 km2 for the latter turbine depending upon this array spacing the number of wind turbines that can be installed within a specific area can be estimated from the relation 8 number of turbines available area array spacing nameplate wind capacity or total installed capacity is calculated by multiplying the nameplate capacity of a single turbine with a number of turbines to compare renewable energy resources such as offshore wind to conventional generation sources in decision making contexts the average output or aep is more useful than installing nameplate capacity several losses in energy production by an offshore wind power plant are taken into consideration 3 5 co2 eq emission avoidance the clean development mechanism cdm under the kyoto protocol to united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc provides an opportunity for the indian power sector to earn revenue through the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions ghg particularly carbon dioxide co2 central electricity authority 2018b in order to facilitate the adoption of an authentic baseline emissions data and also to ensure uniformity in the calculations of co2 emission reductions by cdm project developers the central electricity authority cea has compiled a database containing the necessary data on co2 emissions for all grid connected power stations in india www cea nic in energy production in india is dominated by coal based followed by gas diesel nuclear and hydro therefore a major source of carbon dioxide emissions in india increased use of renewable energy resources like wind energy or by improving the thermal efficiency of power generation can efficiently reduce co2 emissions the amount of co2 emissions are calculated from all the thermal stations annually from different electricity grid sectors and later combined to a mean value therefore if a renewable energy resource like the wind is utilised the same is expected to be avoided the co2 eq emission avoidance is calculated by central electricity authority 2018b 9 co 2 eq emission avoidance t mwh 0 977 aep mwh this value is used for projecting the emission reductions as well as for calculating the actual emission reductions the energy production from offshore wind power plants could reduce the co2 eq emission into the atmosphere 3 6 calculation of suitable area for offshore wind farms offshore wind farms are generally preferred in the region free of conflicts caused due to nautical hazards shipping zones eco sensitive zones avian and visual impacts sheridan et al 2012 these regions are considered in this study to assess the offshore wind power resource of india in addition there are other regions like naval and military operations fire practising areas submarine cables pipelines offshore oil gas platforms etc which needed to be excluded however due to non access to such sensitive datasets they are not considered in this study 3 6 1 bathymetry and turbine foundation technology bathymetric data plays a critical role in selecting the appropriate turbine foundation technology at a given location in the sea different technologies used vary with water depth is shown in fig 3 water depth in the offshore area has a direct impact on the design construction and cost of turbine installation in the present study bathymetry data has been retrieved from the gebco general bathymetric chart of the oceans with a spatial resolution of a 30 arc second to delineate the regions based on depth advanced jacket and floating foundations are under research development fig 3a shows the bathymetry of the indian coastal region the western coastal region has a wide and gentle continental shelf as compared to the eastern coast the width of the shelf decreases from north to the south gujarat gj is having the largest sea area of 90 646 km2 a qualitative comparison of sea versus land extent helps to realize the extent of available offshore sea area useful for developing offshore wind farms as compared to the onshore wind farms in general larger sea areas with smaller land areas is the potential to develop offshore wind farms excluding the island states goa has the highest sea land ratio 2 97 which could be used to the maximum extent to get benefits from the wind energy however the other factors like wind speed potential exclusion zones are also to be considered overall the west coast of india is having larger areas in the shallow waters 0 50 m depth as compared to the east coast of india this typical feature allows currently viable monopile technology to be deployed over large areas along the western coast i e the shelf regions adjoining gujarat maharashtra and karnataka monopiles are currently by far the most popular solution used worldwide with 75 share in comparison with only 5 for jacket tripod options patel et al 2018 within the area having water depth up to 35 m maximum estimated available area is found along the indian coast the jacket type foundation 35 50 m depth viz tripods quadra pods and lattice structures are commercially available recently but the cost of operation is higher than the monopile structures the deeper foundation technologies like advanced jacket and floating are currently under development stage and therefore can be deployed in future as they become commercially available and at lower costs 3 6 2 potential shipping exclusion there are well designated international shipping lanes in the indian seas the bay of bengal and the arabian sea connecting oman yemen indonesia and srilanka with india the ships plying in the arabian sea cross india through the southern tip closest to kanya kumari via colombo in srilanka and enter the bay of bengal forming an east west straight line along 8on latitude generally these commercial vessels do not randomly disperse and deviate from their designated lanes but tend to follow the shortest route between their port of origin and destination in order to understand the shipping conflict to the offshore wind farm development we utilised international comprehensive ocean atmosphere data set icoads icoads is a global marine surface data archive resource collected and reported by voluntary observing ships vos in this study an improved version of icoads data representing a proxy for global ship traffic has been used wang et al 2007 the black coloured pixels in fig 3 are the ship proxies displayed at 0 1 0 1 grid resolution as can be seen the lanes are quite significant in the study region at the indian ocean scale while a closer examination fig 3b reveals an unclear picture of traffic patterns as the study was carried at large scale the resolution of shipping data is sufficient 3 6 3 visual sea shore exclusion any offshore wind project needed to get clearance for environmental impacts such as social factors a sensitive ecosystem and impacts on endangered animals the visual impact is more of a social factor where the construction of the wind project could potentially decrease tourism revenue a research study by national research council nrc revealed that the wind energy projects create negative impacts on the human health and well being the impacts are experienced mainly by the people who live closer to the wind turbines affected by shadow flicker and noise national research council 2007 wind farms produce low frequency and infrasonic noise which may be audible or inaudible therefore wind farms are generally preferred at least at a distance of eight nautical miles away from the seashore sheridan et al 2012 this exclusion also broadly safeguards potential impacts on marine ecosystems like coral reefs mangroves sensitive fish habitats etc 3 6 4 avian exclusion huge structures of the wind turbines are always dangerous to the migratory birds flying from one country to another as most of the birds tend to follow the coastline one nautical mile wide parallel zone to the coast should be excluded for wind farms constructions sheridan et al 2012 both the avian and visual exclusion zones can be observed in fig 3a and b 3 7 wind economics assessment the robustness of investments in the wind power industry has been improved with time and experience green 2011 the final cost of wind energy production is established by the concept of the levelised cost of energy lcoe technique the lcoe computation considers the overall total installed capital expenditure annual maintenance cost and the annual energy production as key parameters according to the formula heptonstall et al 2012 10 lcoe capex fcr opex aep where capex is the initial capital cost capital expenditure opex is the annual operations and maintenance cost aep is the annual energy production mwh and fcr is the annual fixed charged rate which converts the investment lump sum into an annual payment for e g debt repayment pollack 2013 fcr is calculated using chang 2011 11 fcr r 1 r t 1 r t 1 where r is the discount rate and t is the project s economic life span in years in this study 12 annual discounted rate r is adopted mani and dhingra 2013 nagababu et al 2017b and project lifetime t as twenty years cavazzi and dutton 2016 hong and möller 2011 möller et al 2012 3 7 1 capex estimation the main components of capex vary in their proportion of costs heptonstall et al 2012 the offshore development is dominated by the foundation and electrical infrastructure costs which make up a larger proportion of the total capex the deeper and farther from the coast the higher is the cost the investment costs comprise of a fixed component including turbine cost and a variable component foundation grid connection and installation costs depending upon the depth and distance from the coast total investment cost equals to the summation of the capital cost of each item as suggested by hong and möller 2011 dicorato et al 2011 and möller et al 2012 12 capex c wt c found c e c b where c wt is the cost of the wind turbine c found is the cost of the foundation c e is the cost of electricity transmission and c b is the cost of balance of the system the cost of the turbine is dependent on design and specifications as well as approximations of variable external factors like currency exchange discount rates steel prices etc heptonstall et al 2012 jones et al 2014 the turbine cost for 3 mw and 5 mw has been estimated in euros 1 79 76 as on september 8 2019 is derived based on the existing projects as reported by offshore design engineering limited 2007 13 c wt mw 2 95 10 6 ln p wt 375200 where p wt is the rated capacity of each wind turbine offshore wind turbines cost high of the order 1 6 2 1 million per mw hdidouan and staffell 2017 heptonstall et al 2012 due to the increased difficulty in manufacturing transporting and erecting turbines green 2011 an increase of 10 of the basic commercial cost of the wind turbine is assumed for installation and transportation costs dicorato et al 2011 the foundation cost c found is depth dependent with a complex relationship accounting for the applicability of different foundation technologies this has been expressed in the form of a simple linear relationship estimated by eq 14 following hdidouan and staffell 2017 14 c found mw 10900 d 404500 for d 30 m 14100 d 314900 for d 30 m where d is the water depth the unit cost of electrical connection per mw is dependent on the distance of the wind farm from the coast currently high voltage alternating current hvac cables are used to link offshore turbines to an offshore substation due to its existing large scale developments and low development risks as compared to the hv direct current hvdc wind turbines typically generate power at 1 kv ac voltage which is steps up to either 11 kv or 33 kv later the power is transmitted to an offshore substation which then increases the transmission voltage the shore this would be connected directly to the electricity grid or stepped up further to 400 kv at an onshore substation in this study the shortest distance to the selected grid point of each site from the coastline was considered as subsea cable length d s and the shortest distance to the coastline from the high voltage grid was considered as land cable length d l hong and möller 2011 kim et al 2013 the unit cost of connection c e in per installed mw is then given by 15 c e mw 0 38 d s 0 4 d l 76 60 10 6 200 according to some studies the turbine cost foundation cost electrical transmission cost and their installations share around 90 of the total investment cost so the balance cost would be no more than 10 of the investment cost and the same is considered in this study 3 7 2 opex estimation the operation and maintenance costs are highly dependent on the distance of wind farm from the nearest port the port fees and a fixed cost of maintenance generally the shortest distance from the port with adequate tonnage capacity is essential for the installation as well as operations and maintenance the cost function considering all these factors is expressed as 16 opex c fix c port d p c var 100 where c fix is the fixed cost of maintenance assumed as 20 per mwh c port is the port fees activities taken as 3 7 per mwh d p is the distance of wind farm from the nearest port and c var is the variable cost taken as 6 7 per 100 km cavazzi and dutton 2016 at the end of the wind farm operating life decommissioning costs apply however as there may be a residual value associated with the wind farm assets by selling or reusing the same in the event of repowering in this work the impact of decommissioning is assumed neutral to the overall lcoe 4 results and discussion 4 1 comparison of combined scatterometer data firstly a linear regression analysis has been conducted on individual scatterometer datasets with the co located buoys and the coefficients have been applied on the scatterometer and re processed for the whole mission period refer surisetty et al 2019 later merging was done by collecting samples from each satellite using a regular grid of 0 125 12 5 km the data at the buoys rm07 rm08 rm09 ad07 and bd08 have been extracted from the combined merged dataset by using spatial interpolation although there are many buoys available in the study region the amount of data is less for statistical comparison an extensive comparison of four scatterometers and combined scatterometer data with the offshore met buoys was carried out in surisetty et al 2019 as the present study is focused on the wind resource assessment comparative analysis from only few buoys is discussed in this section a logarithmic wind profile assumption was used to extrapolate the buoy winds from 3 m to 10 m height to get the neutrally stable winds in order to compare with the scatterometer winds the error metrics of the combined scatterometer dataset are presented in table 5 the combined dataset showed a mean bias in the wind speed with the range of 0 07 0 14 m s 1 with a very small absolute deviation of around 1 2 2 6 the rmse was low of the order 0 88 m s 1 at rm09 as compared to rm07 and rm08 lesser variability in the winds as revealed by the lesser stde and mae values at rm09 is one of the prime factors for the reduced rmse value similarly the wind power density also showed small absolute deviation that varies from 1 4 to 3 6 with the combined dataset this affects the computation of power production from the turbines with better accuracies the combined data set is very close to the in situ observations and makes it suitable for analyzing the wind energy potential in the study region as the number of collocated wind data at ad07 and bd08 is less the statistics resulting from its comparison with the combined scatterometer dataset is doubtful therefore ignored in the study on the other hand as rm07 rm08 and rm09 are having more than 10 years of in situ data covering all the scatterometers life span thus the resulting error metrics are acceptable 4 2 analysis of wind resource in this section the geographical distribution of wind resource over the north indian ocean is discussed wind resource statistics for the study region are presented in the form of individual maps for each scatterometer as well as the combined form fig 4 shows the number of overlapping data from quikscat oscat ascat a and ascat b scatterometers out of all scatterometers more data is available from the quikscat due to its longer mission period oscat s data coverage is more in the mid arabian sea and in the bay of bengal ascat b has relatively lesser data volume as compared to the ascat a it is evident that the combined data resulted in inhomogeneous data coverage in the spatial domain fig 4e the majority of the 0 125 degree grids are sampled more than 75 of the total period the central arabian sea and the bay of bengal have more than 80 of coverage whereas the coastal regions surrounding the indian mainland and island states have less than 20 of data due to fewer scatterometer measurements the regions covering gulf of mannar north srilanka gulf of kutch and gulf of khambat also have inadequate measurements and thus not acceptable for analysis 4 2 1 wind climate variability india is known for its seasonal variability with four seasons namely winter december january february pre march april may summer june july august september and post october november monsoons seasonal comparison of the winds is very useful for power planning and helpful for the wind farm operators to choose an alternative source in case of winds are very low or very high fig 5 and fig 6 show the synergetic seasonal and annual mean maps of wind speed and wind power density respectively at 80 m hub height the mean annual wind speed at 80 m hub height ranges around 7 m s 1 in the open seas and around 5 6 m s 1 along the indian coastal regions fig 5 the western arabian sea is showing higher mean annual wind speed of around 6 5 8 m s 1 whereas the higher mean annual wind power density 450 550 w m 2 is confined to the region between 6 and 18on latitude and up to 70oe longitude in the bay of bengal region relatively lesser wind power density is observed at around 300 400 w m 2 the southeastern arabian sea shows lesser wind power density of 150 200 w m 2 in particular along kerala and karnataka coasts the highest mean annual wind speed wind power density is observed in the southern parts of tamil nadu reaching values up to 8 5 m s 1 550 w m 2 regarding seasonal analysis the mean offshore wind speed reaches to the maximum to 8 10 m s 1 during the summer monsoon shown in fig 5c particularly in the western and central arabian sea and the central bay of bengal this is due to the prevailing south west monsoon season during the winter monsoon mean wind speed values reach close to 9 m s 1 in the gulf of mannar region southern tip of india relatively strong winds are observed in the central bay of bengal and the central arabian sea close to 7 m s 1 during pre monsoon season winds along the coastal region increase slightly close to 7 m s 1 especially along the gujarat coast and odisha coast whereas in post monsoon wind pattern is similar to that of summer monsoon but with weaker strength fig 7 shows the main variability characteristics of wind speed at 10 m height namely the variability within each year i e mean annual variability mav and the variability from year to year i e inter annual variability iav computed from eqs 1 and 2 the regions in the northern bay of bengal south eastern arabian sea are characterised with mav of 45 highest mav 55 60 is observed in the western arabian sea and the regions surrounding indonesia on the other hand the winds near the southern tip of india surrounding gulf of mannar is not only high but also stable mav 30 enough throughout the year the iav seems to be low for the entire north indian ocean 6 it is common practice in the wind industry to consider the regions having iav around 6 watson 2014 iav is considered as an important parameter in wind energy economics low iav of 4 is observed along the gujarat kerala and south tamil nadu coasts comparing mav iav mean annual wind speed and wind power density the most promising areas coincide for each analysis are south tamil nadu and gujarat coasts furthermore it is to be noted that even after applying the quality flags for all the scatterometer data we have noticed some common artefacts in the satellite winds for example there are many offshore rigs in the bombay high region off mumbai in maharashtra the associated structures at sea may cause corner reflections in radar backscatter data from ascat quikscat hasager et al 2015 and oscat moreover very high backscatter from the ships plying in the international routes especially along the region from southern srilanka to northern indonesia is clearly noticed in the maps in the form of enhanced winds figs 5 and 6 as many ships move along this route they cause ship wakes which cause a misinterpretation of high winds in addition to this corner reflections from the ships also produce high backscatter oscat seems to be more sensitive to the ship effects and ascat is less sensitive to it the study utilises the l2b products no corrections to the moving or stationary targets were applied as it is out of the scope of this study the top panels of fig 8 shows the ve 3m and gm 5m turbines mean power outputs computed from the power curves see fig 2 it represents the average power that would be produced if turbines were placed at that point the plot shows that the southern continental shelf between longitudes 77oe and 80oe latitudes 7on and 9on of the stretch from dhanushkodi to kanya kumari is having the very good potential for wind power development the average power was used in this work rather than yearly energy as it is easier to compare the output with the rated capacity around dhanushkodi an average production of 1600 kw 2200 kw is expected from ve 3m gm 5m turbine very high average power production of 2000 kw is expected along the regions of kolachel and tuticorin with a capacity factor of 0 4 fig 8 these results are comparable with the recent works by nagababu et al 2017a 2016 along the east coast of india an average production of 1000 1200 kw is expected from ve 3m and 1200 1600 kw from the gm 5m turbine however the west coast of india is showing reasonably lesser wind production capability especially along the kerala and karnataka coasts of approximately 500 kw some stretches of maharashtra and gujarat show a production capability of 1200 1500 kw however the availability of wider continental shelf of more than 500 km in gujarat and 300 km in maharashtra and shallower waters of 50 m makes these regions favourable for wind farm installations with viable fixed platform technology monopile a proposal for the development of an offshore wind farm of the capacity of 1000 mw was called by the government of india in the coastal waters off gujarat teri 2015 4 3 comprehensive assessment of wind resource from fig 8 it is clearly understood that many coastal states of india are having the capacity factors 0 3 excepting the regions of kerala there are no detailed studies available in the literature on total wind power potential around each indian coastal state in this section the offshore wind energy resource that can be tapped in the offshore waters of each coastal state within the indian eez will be discussed by considering several factors like bathymetry conflict areas and exclusion zones bathymetry plays a crucial role in selecting the appropriate turbine foundation technology fig 3 represents the turbine foundation technology map derived from the general bathymetric chart of the oceans gebco used for various ranges of water depths within the indian eez for example the monopile foundation is suitable for the depths up to 35 m and floating type of turbines are suitable for the depths greater than 100 m the choice of water depths and the distance from the coast have a direct impact on the design construction maintenance and cost of the turbine and in turn on the cost of power production at present the monopile type of foundation is most viable in terms of economic feasibility the wind classes range between 2 and 3 surrounding the western coastal states gujarat karnataka and maharashtra and along with the eastern coastal states andhra pradesh odisha and west bengal tamil nadu falls under higher wind class category between 4 and 7 fig 9 4 3 1 along shelf seasonal variability to understand the along shelf seasonal variability in the winds we have extracted around 457 grid points along the 50 m depth contour line from the gujarat west coast to the west bengal east coast the seasonal averages of wind speed power density turbine outputs from ve 3m and gm 5m offshore turbines have been computed and shown in fig 10 higher and consistent winds are found in the coastal sector 220 250 of tamil nadu tn this region has small seasonal variability having wind density ranges from 400 to 600 w m 2 in contrast substantial seasonal variability is observed for odisha west bengal coasts gujarat coast also shows slightly lesser seasonal variability in the winds winds are almost constant along kerala coast with speeds around 6 m s 1 and density around 200 w m 2 the southern sector of andhra pradesh coast shows lesser seasonal variability as compared to the northern sector the turbine power output from ve 3m gm 5m turbine ranges from 1200 kw to 2300 kw 1800 3200 kw near tuticorin tn stands the highest in the indian coastal region the regions surrounding porbandar gj is having a higher potential of 1500 kw during the summer season only although higher winds exist the availability of shelf area the presence of ship traffic sensitive marine ecosystems could limit the development of wind farms as discussed in section 3 6 4 3 2 state wise wind resource distribution there are nine coastal states along the indian mainland and two island states each one in the arabian sea and the bay of bengal table 6 can be used to compare different development options for different depth ranges for each indian coastal state the depth ranges are classified according to the turbine foundation technology sheridan et al 2012 where the depth range from 0 to 35 m suits for monopile foundation and 100 1000 m for the floating technology of all the states gujarat is having a wider continental shelf of area 32 065 km2 up to 35 m depth totalling to around 90 646 km2 area this allows nearly around 1 44 525 ve 3m turbines or 1 10 652 gm 5m turbines this would produce an overall nameplate power output of 433 57 gw 3798 twh yr 1 from ve 3m or 553 26 gw 4847 twh yr 1 from gm 5m turbines using commercially viable and proven technology in shallow waters up to 35 m depth there is a power potential of 153 37 gw 1343 twh yr 1 from ve 3m or 195 71 gw 1714 twh yr 1 from gm 5m turbines however the actual power production would be much lesser considering the power curve generator efficiency swept area wind distribution wake effects capacity factor etc the maps of power production include all the above mentioned effects therefore power production from each pixel of 1 1 km2 grid spacing was added to get an average power production instead of considering constant capacity factor multiplied by nameplate capacity as mentioned in sheridan et al 2012 from fig 8 it can be clearly observed that the capacity factor is varying spatially and for different turbines therefore considering constant capacity factor could lead to an overestimation of power production in certain regions having lower wind energy finally it has been estimated that the ve 3m can produce 99 49 gw 871 twh yr 1 power and gm 5m can produce 140 65 gw 1232 twh yr 1 in the gujarat state the state s electrical requirement for the financial year fy 2017 18 is 111 66 twh yr 1 central electricity authority 2018c which is already available from the alternate resources switching over from the conventional resource to wind resource would help in reducing the carbon emissions co2 by around 851 million tons with ve 3m turbines or 1204 million tons with gm 5m turbines if the entire available sea area before exclusion are utilised a carbon emission factor of 0 977 tons per mwh is considered in this study central electricity authority 2018b in decision making contexts it is often necessary to consider potential conflict and exclusion regions in the wind resource assessment in general a visual exclusion zone of 8 nautical miles and an avian exclusion zone of 1 nautical mile from the shore are considered as exclusion zones where no wind farm development is allowed fig 3 in addition regions that could conflict commercial shipping should also be avoided considering all the three factors around 20 of the available shelf area 19017 km2 needed to be avoided for the gujarat coast if fully developed up to 1000 m depth gujarat offshore region has a potential to generate 76 96 gw ve 3m or 108 72 gw gm 5m which translates to around 674 twh yr 1 or 952 twh yr 1 ranking 1 of all the indian coastal states this would reduce the carbon emissions by around 658 million tons with ve 3m and 930 million tons with gm 5m turbines although the winds are relatively weak compared to tamil nadu coastal region the availability of more shelf region benefits gujarat state for wind farm developments maharashtra shared almost equal wind potential capability as tamil nadu and ranked 3 in the case of tamil nadu wind energy is very high as compared to all coastal states the presence of international shipping route along the southern tamil nadu coast narrow continental shelf the proximity to sri lanka and the presence of sensitive ecosystems restricted its rank to no 4 for wind farm developments around 36 of available shelf area becomes unsuitable for wind farm development due to shipping conflict visual and avian exclusion despite having higher wind potential the eez is just only 20 nautical miles as compared to 200 nm by definition and the 1000 m depth contour exists just within 10 nautical miles still there is very good potential of 45 60 gw 400 twh yr 1 or 64 39 gw 564 twh yr 1 from ve 3m or gm 5m turbines respectively after considering the total excluded region lakshadweep has the lowest rank due to lesser shelf availability and weaker winds in contrast the andaman and nicobar islands has more shelf area between 100 and 1000 m depth of around 51 488 km2 if this area is properly utilised there is a potential of 72 47 gw 634 twh yr 1 or 102 67 gw 900 twh yr 1 from ve 3m or gm 5m turbines however due to frequent earthquakes volcanic eruptions in this island state the present viable monopile technology would not be a feasible solution for long term investments in the wind industry however the developing floating turbine technology would benefit this small island for power production and may support exporting power to the neighbouring asian countries the full results for all the coastal states are presented in table 6 the energy requirement and the available energy values for each coastal state for the year 2017 18 central electricity authority 2018c is given in table 7 it can be seen that almost all the coastal states already have enough energy capability excepting few states like kerala tamil nadu odisha and andaman and the nicobar islands however more than three fourths of all the electricity produced is being generated from the conventional and non renewable sources like coal gas diesel etc this produces millions of tons of harmful carbon emissions which lead to direct and indirect health hazards environmental impacts etc switching to clean renewable resources like the wind in this case can help in reducing 3117 with ve 3m or 4417 with gm 5m million tons of co2 emissions every year table 7 if properly planned and executed offshore renewable energy policy many states of india could be benefited in terms of reduction in carbon emissions and more economic growth if at least 10 of the calculated power generation is utilised more than half of the energy requirement of each coastal state can be met given the available area after exclusions and conflict regions of around 22 area india has the potential to install almost 5 75 301 ve 3m or 4 40 465 gm 5m turbines in the shelf region up to 1000 m depth within the eez region this would produce a net power production of 364 21 gw 3190 twh yr 1 or 516 17 gw 4522 twh yr 1 from ve 3m or gm 5m offshore wind turbines this would reduce overall carbon emissions of 3117 and 4418 million tons respectively the energy requirement for the fy 2017 18 is 1337 twh yr 1 and the anticipated power requirement for the fy 2021 22 is to be 1904 twh yr 1 central electricity authority 2019 the total production capacity is therefore 2 4 3 4 times using ve 3m gm 5m more than the energy requirements of fy 2017 18 and 1 6 2 4 times more for the future requirement if utilised to the maximum extent as india is growing in the offshore wind farm industry innovative integration solutions such as load balancing in electrical vehicles through vehicle to grid v2g interconnectivity between the wind projects advanced power storage capacities submarine electrical transmission lines etc are to be prioritized in order to attract the national and international market the present analysis would help in framing the policies and strategic planning for economic viability by categorising the zones for practical wind farm developments in the country 4 4 economic analysis from the above analysis it is clear that gujarat and tamil nadu offshore regions have good potential for wind farms previous studies by fowi reported that zone a as most promising offshore wind development area in gujarat and tamil nadu regions see fig 11 for more details the reader is suggested to refer to the reports fowind 2018 in a latest study on concept design for a demonstration project of 150 504 mw in tamil nadu and gujarat a sub zone a3 out of 19 sub zones in gj and out of 10 sub zones in tn see fig 12 has been suggested to be an optimum site due to its proximity to the coast depth and various other factors table 8 shows key parameters such as mean annual wind speed mean annual technical power production from ve 3m and gm 5m the distance of the site from the coast port and distance of electrical grid respectively at the above site in gujarat the sub zone a3 is located at around 14 km from the pipvav port between rajula and diu cities whereas in tamil nadu the a3 sub zone is location at around 28 km from the tuticorin port in this work we have calculated levelised cost of energy lcoe in mwh considering ve 3m and gm 5m turbines a3 sub zone table 9 shows the mean annual technical energy production at 80 m from ve 3m and gm 5m after considering the losses due to availability wake etc out of the two sites tamil nadu site having 5 mw turbine and monopile depth 30 m foundation technology shows the lowest lcoe of 106 87 mwh suggesting an optimum site for wind farm development it is due to the highest annual mean wind speed and technical wind power production on the other hand gujarat region with 5 mw turbine shows lcoe of 146 48 mwh although winds are relatively weaker in this region the wind farm is affordable at this site due to its close proximity to the port very shallow waters that reduces the operational and maintenance costs to many folds these numbers are broadly in line with earlier studies alluri et al 2017 fowind 2018 nagababu et al 2017a 4 4 1 model sensitivity the cost of offshore wind power generation increases with an increase in the investment cost and decreases in the wind energy potential in order to understand this impact on lcoe six parameters were altered systematically to test the model sensitivity interest rate 2 the lifetime of the wind farm 5 years availability 5 capex 5 annual energy production 5 the sensitivity of lcoe to interest rate is greatest with 2 increase or decrease in value resulting a change of 44 and 30 mwh for ve 3m and gm 5m respectively at gujarat site fig 12 a b and a change of 30 and 20 mwh for ve 3m and gm 5m respectively at tamil nadu site fig 12 c d lcoe has a positive impact when the interest rate is reduced shortening the lifetime of the wind farm to 15 years will add around 17 and 11 mwh in gujarat and 12 and 8 mwh in tamil nadu to the energy cost although it is not recommended to consider shorter than the design life it would give a general idea of cost risk in case of early failure of the wind farm on the other hand lengthening the lifetime to 25 years will have a proportionately smaller advantage the cost of power generation showed an increase with an increase in capex and decrease in wind energy potential the energy potential aep has a much bigger effect on the lcoe after the interest rate lower aep has a bigger impact by increasing the lcoe by 19 and 13 mwh with 3 mw turbines and by 13 and 9 mwh with 5 mw turbines respectively therefore it is clear that the selection of an optimum site is sensitive to many parameters and assumptions in addition to these assumptions there are some possible ways of reducing lcoe by improving the foundation technology more efficient turbines and by reducing transmission losses with advanced high voltage direct current hvdc this would lead to capital cost reduction and reduction in energy losses over the long distance transmission increasing turbine size and power rating with further have a good impact on the installation cost 5 conclusions the present study provided a detailed assessment of offshore wind power resource in the indian eez including lakshadweep and andaman nicobar islands based on the synergetic use of multiple scatterometers data the results indicate that offshore wind resource is sufficient to support the nation s present and future electric power requirement this study compared quikscat oscat ascat a and ascat b scatterometers with measured offshore winds from met buoys and adjusted the scatterometers data in order to provide better offshore wind power production estimates the following points are noteworthy to be concluded in the study the synergetic approach of combining different scatterometers data proved advantageous in terms of the increased number of samples the inclusion of diurnal variations of winds and reduced statistical uncertainty in the southern parts of tamil nadu the offshore region between 7 9on and 77 80oe the mean wind speed reaches around 8 10 m s 1 and the power density to around 500 w m 2 highest as compared to other regions of the country this region could be one of the promising sites for wind farm installations very high average power production of 2000 kw is expected along the regions of kolachel and tuticorin with a capacity factor of 0 4 higher and consistent winds are found along the southern tamil nadu tn with small seasonal variability having wind density ranges from 400 to 600 w m 2 gujarat ranks 1 due to the availability of wider shelf area 71629 km2 capable to install 1 14 204 v112 3m and 87 438 g128 5m offshore turbines with a nameplate capacity of 342 61 gw and 437 19 gw power production based on the availability on the wind potential and turbine properties the actual power production would be 76 96 gw 674 twh yr 1 and 108 72 gw 952 twh yr 1 after subtracting the exclusion zones and conflict areas although andaman and nicobar islands have good potential after gujarat the proximity to volcanoes frequent earthquakes and availability of more shelf area beyond 100 m depth suitable for floating turbine technology makes it not viable for the wind farm industry however there is a good scope in future for this region once the technology is fully matured close proximity to sri lanka international shipping route availability of lesser shelf area makes tamil nadu as the second choice for wind farm development albeit higher wind speed availability than other regions on the other hand the majority of kerala coastal region and some coastal stretches of karnataka are having a very less wind power density of less than 150 w m 2 less feasible for the wind farm industry given the available area after exclusions and conflict regions of around 22 area and the turbine spacing india has a net power production of 364 gw 3190 twh yr 1 for v112 3m or 516 gw 4521 twh yr 1 for g128 5m turbines this would reduce overall carbon emissions of 3117 and 4418 million tons per year respectively the power so generated can suffice 2 4 3 4 times of india s anticipated electricity demand for the fy 2017 18 and 1 6 2 4 times of future demand for the fy 2021 22 with v112 3m g128 5m turbines out of the two a3 subzones in gujarat and tamil nadu the latter site with 5 mw turbine and monopile depth 30 m foundation technology shows the lowest lcoe of 106 87 mwh suggesting an optimum site for wind farm development sensitivity analysis shows that for a capital intensive investment in an offshore wind farm the interest rate is a critical parameter in determining the cost of output energy the cost of power generation showed an increase with an increase in capex and decrease in wind energy potential author contribution statement surisetty v v arun kumar conceptualization software validation writing original draft data curation writing
