14755,in situ chemical oxidation isco is widely used as an efficient remediation technology for groundwater pollution however quantitative studies of its reactive remediation process under coupled thermal desorption technology are scarce based on laboratory experiments and site remediation the chemical oxidation remediation reaction process was quantified and the apparent reaction equation of the isco process was constructed and then a numerical model coupled with hydraulic thermal chemical htc fields was built to quantitatively describe the remediation process of an actual contaminated site the simulation results fit well with the site monitoring data and the results indicated that thermal desorption strengthens the isco remediation effect in addition the htc model is expanded to build a conceptual and numerical model of a coupled remediation system including heating and remediation wells the results showed that high temperature conditions enhance the activity of remediation chemicals and increase the rate of remediation reaction to obtain a better remediation effect the heating wells increase the regional temperature accelerating the diffusion of pollutants and remediation chemicals and promoting adequate contact and reaction based on this crucial mechanism thermal desorption coupled with isco technology can significantly improve remediation efficiency

industrial production many dangerous and toxic organic compounds are consistently produced and emitted honetschlägerová et al 2019 wang et al 2022b the groundwater and soil are contaminated with pollutants such as aniline naphthalene and dichloroethylene making the production site unsuitable for human life crowding out the spaces for developing human communities increasing the risk of contaminant dispersion wang et al 2021 organic contamination in soil and groundwater systems is becoming a more severe and critical environmental issue in many countries in situ chemical oxidation isco is an effective technology for the removal of organic contaminants in soil and groundwater with the advantages of convenient construction low impact on the surrounding environment and high remediation efficiency baciocchi et al 2014 xie et al 2020 the oxidants chosen by isco are generally inorganic chemicals with solid oxidizing properties such as traditional oxidants permanganate mno 4 ozone o3 and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 wei et al 2022 the new oxidant reactive persulfates peroxydisulfate pds s 2 o 8 2 peroxymonosulfate pms hso 5 have a strong oxidizing capacity and extensive remediation range which makes them competitive in engineering applications and gains more attention to the studies on the effectiveness of alkaline activated persulfate ps remediation hong et al 2022 matzek and carter 2016 wang et al 2020 compared to other oxidizing agents peroxydisulfate has the advantage of low cost and suitable environmental retention time among the various compounds of pds

remediation effect of the agent called oxidant activation luo et al 2021 the activation principle is that the redox potential e0 determines the oxidation capacity e0 of peroxydisulfate is 2 01 v while

liu et al 2023 zhang et al 2020a eqs 1 and 2 show the alkali activation mechanisms of pds the ph of pds is kept at 10 12 as the best when ph 12 the generated ho will react with s o 4 first and reduce the remediation efficiency of organic contaminant lominchar et al 2018 wei et al 2022 the investigation of radicals provides significant assistance in enhancing remediation efficiency however the

currently researchers have focused mainly on the activation factors of each remediation agent such as light heat microorganisms and transition metal ions kim et al 2021 xiong et al 2022 in isco remediation the limitation of oxidant delivery in the aquifer makes its remediation effect uneven if the project obstinately increases the oxidant concentration secondary contamination of oxidant residue may be generated at the center of the delivery point chen et al 2019 head et al 2020 ji et al 2017 tressler and uchrin 2014 the isco remediation process is numerically simulated to quantify

used a numerical solution of an advection dispersion reaction equation to explain the trailing and rebound effects generated by permanganate applications in isco and quantify a correlation between the rate of concentration rebound and molecular diffusivity the temperature also impacts the remediation of organic contamination by constructing heating wells in situ thermal remediation technology expedites the site s biological and chemical reaction process to fulfill the treatment goal heron et al 2005 wang et al 2019 regarding isco high temperature circumstances can not only significantly increase the reaction rate and shorten the engineering cycle but they can increase the degree of reaction and remediation impact chen et al 2019 wang et al 2022a demonstrated the temperature field variation in situ thermal remediations and discussed the main influencing factors through laboratory experiments and numerical simulations thermal desorption is the core technique of in situ thermal remediation which promotes volatilization decomposition and consumptive reactions of organic matter in soil through heating applying thermal desorption technology in isco is less commonly used in practice and its setup is more complex than that of a single technology solution before implementing solutions practical engineering should apply numerical simulations for the best remediation results zhang et al 2020b to design an environment friendly and efficient isco remediation solution this study selected a common organic contaminant aniline an to realize the following research objectives 1 to establish cor apparent reaction and obtain reagent pollutant reaction ratios in the laboratory experiments 2 to construct an htc multi field coupled model to quantify the isco remediation processes

and interfaces from the finite element solution principle ma et al 2022 santonastaso et al 2018 2 2 laboratory experimental setup and simulated scenarios a series of laboratory experiments were set up to determine the reaction ratios between remediation agents and contaminants and the apparent chemical reaction equations aniline is a typical contaminant containing nitrogen and it is also a prominent organic contaminant in the site remediation of this study anotai et al 2011 sodium persulfate a highly efficient and easy to operate chemical was selected as the oxidant and naoh solution was the activator therefore alkaline activated persulfate was called the chemical oxidative remediation agent in this study hussain et al 2014 mustapha et al 2021 the agents included sodium persulfate na2s2o8 99 aniline c6h7n 98 sodium hydroxide naoh 98 5 phosphoric acid h3po4 98 5 meoh ch3oh hplc grade 1 reaction ratio measurement experiments at the beginning of the experiment changing the ph to 11 by adding naoh solution into 1 0 mmol l aniline solution to stabilize the oxidation reaction environment to weaken and ignore the uncertain influence of the amount of activator used on the restoration reaction process then the reaction flask was added with ps stock solution and the reaction flask was then placed in a constant temperature water bath to react two sets of water bath temperatures high temperature 80 c and low temperature 20 c were set to explore the impact of temperature on the reaction ratios ma et al 2020 the specific experiment scheme is shown in table 1 after a specific time 0 5 ml reaction solution was taken the reaction was quenched using the same volume of meoh and analyzed within two hours using high performance liquid chromatography hplc the specific analytical conditions were 0 1 phosphate buffer of 95 h2o and 5 meoh a flow rate of 0 8 ml min and a detection wavelength of 253 nm by fitting the peak areas of aniline solutions at 0 25 0 5 0 75 1 0 and 2 0 mmol l to the aniline concentrations to obtain a standard curve the plotted peak areas were compared with the standard curve to obtain the amount of contaminant remediation to calculate the reaction ratio 2 kinetic thermodynamic parameters measurement experiments temperature controlled experiments can obtain the key kinetic thermodynamic coupling parameters required for multi field coupling modeling e g apparent activation energy frequency factor and reaction enthalpy this study arranged multiple experiments with two contaminant concentrations and five thermal conditions the initial concentration of ps was 2 0 mmol l and the contaminant concentration ct was measured every 10 min the ratio of ct to the initial contaminant concentration c0 was the normalized contaminant concentration the ln ct c0 an t relationship curves under different temperature conditions can be obtained after taking the negative logarithm by assuming that the apparent activation energy is a constant in the experimental temperature range the apparent activation energy of the aniline contamination cor reaction can be obtained by fitting the arrhenius equation the specific experiment scheme is shown in table 1 2 3 site experiment of isco remediation the isco remediation site in nanjing jiangsu province is an abandoned chemical plant site adjacent to the yangtze river after conducting a site environmental investigation and risk assessment according to the differences in the complexity and extent of region pollution the contaminated site was divided into isco remediation areas green and ex situ remediation areas red as shown in fig 1 most of the site is an ex situ remediation area there are two isco remediation areas a smaller area in the southwest corner of the site and a narrow area in the east groundwater belongs to loose rock pore phreatic water which receives recharge from precipitation and discharges through runoff and evaporation the overall groundwater flow direction of the site is from east to west during the simulation and monitoring period the actual remediation project only conducted remediation reagent injection and corresponding monitoring in the northern of the in situ remediation area therefore the 10 m southward extension of the injection area of the remediation agent was selected as the simulation boundary and the boundary of the adjacent ex situ remediation area on the west side was selected as the simulation boundary and the northern and eastern boundaries are taken to the confining boundaries due to the presence of waterproof curtains the above ranges are used as the simulation area of this model as the dark green area in fig 1 the initial pollution plume was distributed in the northern and southern parts of the simulation area therefore two different well placement schemes were designed as shown in fig 1 a remediation well rw cluster with one monitoring well was set based on the center of the contamination plume nine wells were set in the northern rw cluster with an average interval of 5 m the rw was set in the center of the contamination plume with a concentration of 177 μg l monitoring well j2 was set in the northern part of the contamination plume seven wells were set in the southern rw cluster and monitoring well j1 was set in the center of the contamination plume with a concentration of 68 μg l the two well deployment schemes can be used to study the remediation effect of different parts of the contaminated plume the site is flat with an elevation range of about 9 01 11 11 m the simulated area can be generalized into two layers of the phreatic aquifer and relative aquitard in the vertical direction the setting temperature is the average daily temperature 5 c of the actual injection month december in the area the site locates in the area of river terraces sandy beaches and shallow ditches the natural soil is yellow brown loam the terraces are distributed with loess like sub clay the beaches and ditches are distributed with clay and silt and the underlying bedrock is a sandy conglomerate the physical and chemical property parameters of the site soil are shown in table 2 the site strata are mainly filled layers including miscellaneous fill and plain fill and chalky clay layers groundwater is mainly stored in the fill layers the permeability coefficients of each layer are shown in table 3 during the actual isco remediation the oxidizing agent also reacts with the reducing substances in the soil and generates additional consumption called soil oxidant demand sod and is usually related to the soil type and organic mass content marcon et al 2021 the experiment was conducted for 25 days and monitored on day 11 and the temperature was the ambient temperature sod was measured in the non contaminated area of the site and the results showed that the sod measured using naoh activated persulfate as the remediation agent was 3 390 0 022 g of ps per 1 kg of soil consumed the consumption is generated in the natural environment and other factors also affect the ps such as self decay and biological effects the isco remediation area on the site s east side is about 2714 5 m2 and the media volume is about 10 586 5 m3 i e 17 997 2 kg the average mass of ps added to each 1 kg of soil in the actual site remediation process is about 6 69 g so the ps reacting with the target contaminant after consuming soil organic matter and other reducing substances accounts for about 49 3 of the total injection volume the primary rate constant of the ps hydrolysis reaction is 3 7 10 4 d 1 so the contribution of hydrolysis consumption is negligible house 1962 the number of remediation chemicals injected in this simulation was set as 49 3 of the actual construction injection amount of the site to simulate the additional consumption of ps by sod in the actual remediation process and ultimately reduce the influence of the isco remediation on the accuracy of the model bortone et al 2019 ranc et al 2016 fang et al 2018 determined the sod values of persulfate depletion in typical soils of various regions in china and obtained the half life of ps in various types of soils the half life of yellow brown soil in nanjing is 16 9 1 6 days which is consistent with the experiment result based on the apparent chemical equations of remediation reactions obtained from the laboratory experiments and combined with the contamination extent of aniline in the simulated area the ratio of site remediation reagents formulated by mass was controlled to be approximately na2s2o8 naoh 5 2 with the ps concentration of about 0 84 mol l lominchar et al 2018 in the engineering design the rws are combined with the actual situation concerning the diamond shaped deployment scheme two monitoring wells are set upstream and downstream of the groundwater flow as shown in fig 2 a the diameter of the rws is about 63 mm and the influence radius of each agent injection well is approximately 3 m the site was sampled before the remediation background value and on day 3 day 5 day 7 and day 11 after the remediation the 3d model of the simulation area is shown in fig 2 the west side of the simulation area is the water flow outlet boundary the south side is the constant head boundary the top boundary receives infiltration recharge from atmospheric precipitation and the recharge rate is about 3 5 10 4 m d the north east and bottom boundaries are impermeable 2 4 numerical experiments site remediation simulations verified the effectiveness of the multi field coupling model for predicting contaminant changes during the remediation process to further optimize the pollution remediation techniques this study designed a scheme of coupled heating wells and chemical oxidation rws and constructed a 3d model according to the site stratigraphic structure the isco remediation simulation coupling with thermal desorption technology was carried out on this basis bryck 2014 shi et al 2019 this model can be applied as a fundamental unit for deploying well clusters and large scale simulations at present there are very few studies of this technique ma et al 2018 the organic contamination site is generalized as a two layer inhomogeneous phreatic aquifer with a 2 m thick medium sand in the upper layer and a 3 m thick fine sand in the lower layer the overall geometry is 50 m 25 m 5 m length width height an rw was installed in the center of the site with a diameter of 13 cm and a depth of 4 5 m moreover four heating wells with a diameter of 15 cm and a depth of 4 5 m were arranged in a square quadrilateral pattern around the chemical injection well three points p1 p2 and p3 with x coordinates of 26 5 30 and 40 respectively were selected as model observation points in the east direction positive direction of the x axis of the remediation agent injection well the wells were all 15 cm in diameter and 4 5 m in depth as shown in fig 3 in the hydrodynamic field the west side of the simulation area is a constant head boundary with a head of 4 5 m the east side is a surface river set with a constant head boundary with a head of 3 8 m assuming that the top is covered with waterproof insulation material limiting evaporation and atmospheric precipitation recharge the top and bottom north and south sides are confining boundaries the groundwater recharges the river on the east side flowing from west to east in the thermal field the initial temperature of the aquifer system is set to 20 c the north west and south boundary of the simulation area are set with constant temperatures of 20 c 15 c and 20 c respectively the east side is the heat outflow boundary to simulate the heat exchange accompanied by convection during the ground surface water interaction the top of the site is a heat insulated boundary i e the heat flux is 0 the bottom of the model is generalized to a constant temperature boundary with ignoring the effect of the ground temperature gradient and the temperature is set to 20 c in the chemical field the east and west sides of the model are solute exchange boundaries and the rest of the boundaries are flux less boundaries the simulated aquifer system is set as two layers the upper layer is composed of medium sand and the lower layer is composed of fine sand and then given empirical parameters for its hydraulics and thermodynamics meanwhile based on the kinetic thermodynamic experimental results of the aniline cor reaction the apparent frequency factor a a n f the apparent activation energy e a n f enthalpy h a n of cor reaction of aniline in the model was obtained and the relevant parameters are shown in table 4 3 results 3 1 cor reaction apparent parameters and thermal effects before conducting cor reaction laboratory experiments a standard curve for plotting the ratio of peak area hplc to aniline concentration is first obtained so that the concentration of aniline can be quantified directly by peak area and the obtained regression equation y 3 560 187 92553x with r2 0 9998 x represents the aniline concentration and y represents the plotted peak area the standard curve is the foundation for the following experiments 1 reaction ratio measurement experiments the normalized concentration of aniline is the ratio of the measured concentration ant to the initial concentration an0 then the variation curve with the experimental time demonstrates the extent of the reaction as shown in fig 4 the excess aniline in the experiment allowed for a more accurate result of the reaction ratios and ant an0 is stable in the 0 9 to 0 95 as shown in fig 4 the difference between ant an0 at low and high temperatures is slight indicating that the effect of temperature on the cor reaction ratio is slight the two experiments results showed that ps of about 19 45 and 19 88 mol were required for each mol of aniline consumed at low 20 c and high 80 c respectively the apparent chemical reaction equation could be written as an 20ps product in addition the aniline concentration decreases fast at high temperatures and is more stable after the decrease which indicates that high temperatures can accelerate the cor rate and improve the restoration effect 2 kinetic thermodynamic parameters measurement experiments fig 5 shows the variation of ant an0 in the cor process at different temperatures the decomposition rates of aniline are different for the initial aniline concentration excess an0 250 mg l and non excess an0 10 mg l conditions when an0 10 mg l and the experimental temperature was between 5 c and 40 c ant an0 was greater than 0 9 the reaction degree was low and the difference was insignificant when t 60 c the reaction degree was greatly improved however in the first 20 min of the experiment its reaction rate was low i e the reaction started slowly when t 70 c its reaction degree and reaction rate was significantly increased after an0 was increased to 250 mg l the overall degradation of aniline decreased significantly compared with the low initial concentration the reaction rate was slow and increased gradually with the increase in temperature the divergence of aniline decomposition at different temperature conditions occurs at two time points the first one is t 10 min and ant an0 starts to decrease at medium high temperatures t 40 c while the changes are not evident at low temperatures t 5 c t 20 c the second shunt occurred at t 45 min and ant an0 decreased rapidly at high temperatures t 60 c t 70 c while ant an0 changed slowly at medium temperatures t 40 c the calculation results were much smaller than the low initial concentration group see table 5 the apparent activation energy varied less in the experimental temperature range it could be approximated as a constant the apparent activation energy of the chemical oxidation of aniline pollution remediation reaction by ps at an0 10 mg l was obtained as 85 94 kj mol and the apparent frequency factor was 2 70 1011 m60 s mol20 by fitting the arrhenius equation the apparent activation energy is 79 64 kj mol and an apparent frequency factor is 5 85 109 m60 s mol20 at an0 250 mg l which are smaller than the corresponding fitted calculation results of the low initial concentration group these factors will be applied as essential parameters in the model setup the reaction enthalpy for the chemical oxidation of aniline by ps is mainly based on the standard molar enthalpy of each substance assuming the reaction equation mustapha et al 2021 s2o2 8 c6h7n 15h2o 2so2 4 2h 6co2 h no 3 17h2 the reaction enthalpy is 1157 1 kj mol and the reaction is exothermic 3 2 isco remediation agents distribution and remediation effects verification the period of isco remediation simulation is set to 11 days which is consistent with the site s monitoring time the ps simulation distribution on day 11 is shown in fig 6 the ps plume in the northern site is distributed in a point pattern the concentration distribution of each plume is similar and the control range of the remediation agent is large in contrast the injecting ps in the southern site is connected to a single plume and its remediation agent concentration is higher due to the lower concentration of the southern contamination plume as shown in fig 7 the measured aniline concentration at j1 gradually decreased after the remediation agent injection the decrease at the early remediation stage would be more significant due to a certain distance from the initial contaminated area of aniline the contaminant did not spread to j2 at the beginning of remediation therefore the aniline was not available before day 4 after that aniline was transported with water flow and the aniline concentration gradually increased due to the influence of pollution diffusion at j2 being more significant at monitoring point j2 the aniline concentration reaches a peak around day 8 the initial concentration in the center of the pollution plume is high while the peak concentration is only 20 μg l under the dual effect of diffusion and remediation which is still higher than the less contaminated monitoring point j1 then the aniline concentration decreases rapidly due to the fixed total amount of contaminant sources the contamination diffusion effect continues to weaken and the remediation effect is stable it could be found that the concentration change curve obtained from the simulation is consistent with the actual monitoring values of aniline concentration which confirms the effectiveness of the multi field coupling model used in predicting the change in contaminant concentration during the isco remediation 3 3 influence of thermal desorption coupling on isco remediation based on the above conceptual model a circular aniline contaminated area with a radius of 2 5 m and an initial concentration of 0 25 mol m3 was established in the center of the site and the rws were continuously injected with ps remediation agent with a concentration of 2 5 mol m3 for 200 days the heating well temperatures tw were set to 30 c 50 c 70 c and 90 c respectively simulations were conducted to obtain the distributions of aniline and remediation reaction products so2 4 on days 60 120 and 200 under different temperature conditions as shown in figs 8 and 9 at the early stage of remediation 60 days the difference in concentration distribution between aniline and remediation reaction products under different heating well temperatures was slight and the thermal field s coupling effect was not significant the aniline concentration was lower and the residual range was smaller under high temperature conditions by the 120th day in contrast the concentration of the remediation reaction products was higher and the migration and diffusion range gradually expanded at the end of the remediation day 200 the aniline concentration and residual range decreased with the increase of heating well temperature and the reaction product concentration and migration diffusion range gradually increased as shown in fig 8 the remediation of aniline is highly influential within the area surrounded by the heating wells however the remediation of surrounding areas under the influence of solute migration and diffusion is the core problem in solving contamination therefore the observation point p2 is used as the observation target and the changes in the aniline and remediation reaction product are shown in fig 10 the simulation results showed that the aniline concentration at p2 gradually increased in the early stage due to the upstream solute migration and diffusion the difference in aniline concentration under different heating well temperature conditions was slight with the extension of heating time the concentration of aniline at p2 decreased significantly due to the chemical oxidation reaction this stage 60 120 days was also the significant time when the difference in aniline concentration widened under different temperature conditions which was caused by the high temperature increases in the rate of remediation reaction the reaction product concentration also increases in this process but in the late stage the reaction product slowly decreases due to the influence of diffusion the aniline concentration at p2 at tw 90 c was only 29 3 of that at tw 30 c on day 200 and the former s remediation reaction rate was 1 6 times higher than the latter overall the high temperature coupling effect can strengthen the in situ chemical oxidative remediation of aniline contaminated groundwater with ps and improve the remediation efficiency when quantitatively characterizing the in situ chemical oxidative remediation process under high temperature strengthening conditions such as thermal desorption considering the coupling effect and influence of the temperature field is necessary 4 discussion in the previous section determining the impact of heating well temperature on the remediation effect was complicated due to the variation of aniline concentration a new model was developed under the above conceptual model settings to simulate the variation of seepage and temperature fields at various heating well temperatures excluding aniline contamination sun et al 2021 waldemer et al 2007 the new model will be utilized to examine the impact of temperature and solute variation of agents on contamination remediation 4 1 thermal desorption changes the hydrodynamic process in site remediation the injection wells were continuously injected with remediation chemicals of 30 mol m3 for 60 days with a constant temperature for the heated wells tw the simulation observed the variation of darcy velocity at observation point p1 and the variation of water flow rate at the downstream river boundary under different tw conditions as shown in fig 11 due to the high specific heat capacity and latent heat water absorbs heat more quickly than soil during the heating leading to a change in properties wang et al 2019 if the chemical reaction between remediation agents and contaminants is not considered and the influence of temperature on dispersion is neglected the effect of the thermal field on the chemical field is mainly observed through its indirect effect on solute migration and diffusion by changing the hydrodynamic field the darcy velocity at observation point p1 showed a trend of decreasing and then increasing during the simulation period see fig 11a the higher the tw the greater the variation of the darcy velocity at p1 the increasing darcy velocity at tw 90 c on day 200 compared to that at tw 30 c was about 16 7 the density and dynamic viscosity of the fluid decreased when the temperature increased combined with the simulation results of the water flux at the downstream channel boundary fig 11b it can be found that the water flux also showed decreasing first and then increased the total groundwater flux increased by about 4 1 in 200 days when the tw raised from 30 to 90 c under the model setting conditions the density decrease has a more significant impact on the overall change of the darcy velocity than the reduction of the dynamic fluid viscosity in the first part of the simulation period so the darcy velocity tends to decrease in the middle and late parts the reduction of the dynamic viscosity affects the darcy velocity more than the density so the darcy velocity gradually increases the higher the temperature the greater the increase the darcy velocity increase correlates with the heating well temperature increase which ultimately affects the water flux the range of high temperature area becomes wide as the tw increases resulting in a significant increase in water flux at the downstream boundary there is a significant difference in the diffusion range of aniline at different temperatures see fig 8 the increasing temperature expands the diffusion range of aniline the transport of pollution beyond the control range of the remediation agent with water flow and generating the contamination trailing at the end of the remediation process although high temperature conditions improved the remediation efficiency they also expanded the distribution range of residual contamination the trailing effect is a common challenge in groundwater remediation which needs to be further emphasized bryck 2014 4 2 the influence process of thermal desorption on thermal chemical fields the change in the thermal chemical fields can intuitively reflect the relationship between temperature remediation agent and restoration effect the thermal field distribution in the simulation differs particularly under different tw and the thermal field changes less in the early stage see fig 12 the influence of tw on the overall migration and dispersion of remediation agents is slight as the extended heating time expanded the range of high temperature zones and increased the groundwater flow rate the effects of the thermal field on the migration and dispersion of remediation agents gradually became apparent the simulation results in fig 13 showed that on day 100 the differences in the migration and diffusion ranges of the remediation agents under different heating well temperature conditions were slight however on day 200 as the tw increased the central concentration decreased and the temperature distribution difference become more pronounced the migration and diffusion ranges of the remediation agents were more prominent at higher heating well temperatures however affected by flow velocity changes the central concentrations of the remediation agents decreased significantly at higher temperatures to make the results representative the three monitoring points in fig 3 were used to quantify the change in drug concentration the concentrations at different temperatures at the three observation points are shown in table 6 the monitoring points p1 and p2 are close to the heating well first affected by thermal desorption the higher the temperature of the heating well tw the faster the flow and the more substantial the dilution of remediation agents the closer the heating well the longer the heating time and the more significant the decrease in the concentration of the remediation agent compared to the maximum heating well temperature 90 c the concentration of remediation agents at p1 was about 10 9 lower under the minimum heating well temperature 30 c while the concentration of remediation agents at p2 was only about 7 1 lower on day 100 on day 200 the concentration decreased by 17 3 and 14 8 respectively unlike p1 and p2 the monitoring point p3 is located far from the heating well and at the edge of the ps migration diffusion range therefore with the increase in the temperature of the heating well and the heating time the concentration of the remediation agent at p3 increases gradually meanwhile the diffusion range and the remediation agent migration increase simultaneously the laboratory experiments have demonstrated that high temperature conditions increase the degree of contaminant agent reaction which is the hydrochemical mechanism of thermal desorption enhancing isco the numerical simulation demonstrates the thermodynamic mechanism that changes the percolation velocity and diffuses the solute by increasing the temperature thus enhancing the contaminant agent contact this study further illustrates the complexity of isco remediation processes and its internal mechanism deserves continuous attention 5 conclusions this paper studied the mechanism of optimizing isco remediation for organically contaminated groundwater meanwhile quantified the cor reaction processes by the conceptional model laboratory experiments and practical project verification the results elaborated on the phenomenon and mechanism of thermal coupling enhancement of isco in hydrochemistry and thermodynamics and demonstrated the ability to remediate contamination the laboratory experiments revealed an apparent reaction equation with the reference value and thermal effect activation energy frequency factor and reaction enthalpy obtained between the aniline and ps and the hydrochemical causes of temperature affect the remediation effect i e high temperature enhances the degree of reaction the site remediation and simulation provided the actual soil and hydrodynamic parameters for the htc multi field coupling model combined with the contamination monitoring data and the effectiveness of the model in predicting the remediation effect was verified in addition the remediation results of the two well placement scenarios show that decentralizing the rw in the center of the contamination plume and the surrounding area allows for more effective remediation of aniline contamination and also avoids secondary contamination from remediation agent residues a new thermal desorption coupled isco remediation model with heating wells was established the results showed that adding heating wells can enhance the restoration effect and expand the remediation well impact area the restoration effect increases with increasing heating well temperature and heating time analysis from the perspective of the mechanism the heating wells directly impact the seepage and temperature fields increasing the temperature and solution flow rate in the remediation area and accelerating the diffusion of contaminants and remediation agents while the remediation area is expanded the contaminants are diluted and contact the remediation agent more thoroughly these two remediation principles and their influence factors were verified and discussed by non reactive transport simulations the combination of the thermal desorption technique and isco remediation should be further applied to remediation engineering to improve remediation efficiency and shorten the remediation cycle the quantitative simulation and the multi field coupling model s prediction can precisely reduce the chemical injection and avoid secondary pollution in the actual projects data availability data will be made available on request credit authorship contribution

industrial production many dangerous and toxic organic compounds are consistently produced and emitted honetschlägerová et al 2019 wang et al 2022b the groundwater and soil are contaminated with pollutants such as aniline naphthalene and dichloroethylene making the production site unsuitable for human life crowding out the spaces for developing human communities increasing the risk of contaminant dispersion wang et al 2021 organic contamination in soil and groundwater systems is becoming a more severe and critical environmental issue in many countries in situ chemical oxidation isco is an effective technology for the removal of organic contaminants in soil and groundwater with the advantages of convenient construction low impact on the surrounding environment and high remediation efficiency baciocchi et al 2014 xie et al 2020 the oxidants chosen by isco are generally inorganic chemicals with solid oxidizing properties such as traditional oxidants permanganate mno 4

the remediation efficiency of organic contaminant lominchar et al 2018 wei et al 2022 the investigation of radicals provides significant assistance in enhancing remediation efficiency however the

currently researchers have focused mainly on the activation factors of each remediation agent such as light heat microorganisms and transition metal ions kim et al 2021 xiong et al 2022 in isco remediation the limitation of oxidant delivery in the aquifer makes its remediation effect uneven if the project obstinately increases the oxidant concentration secondary contamination of oxidant residue may be generated at the center of the delivery point chen et al 2019 head et al 2020 ji et al 2017 tressler and uchrin 2014 the isco remediation process is numerically simulated to quantify

used a numerical solution of an advection dispersion reaction equation to explain the trailing and rebound effects generated by permanganate applications in isco and quantify a correlation between the rate of concentration rebound and molecular diffusivity the temperature also impacts the remediation of organic contamination by constructing heating wells in situ thermal remediation technology expedites the site s biological and chemical reaction process to fulfill the treatment goal heron et al 2005 wang et al 2019 regarding isco high temperature circumstances can not only significantly increase the reaction rate and shorten the engineering cycle but they can increase the degree of reaction and remediation impact chen et al 2019 wang et al 2022a demonstrated the temperature field variation in situ thermal remediations and discussed the main influencing factors through laboratory experiments and numerical simulations thermal desorption is the core technique of in situ thermal remediation which promotes volatilization decomposition and consumptive reactions of organic matter in soil through heating applying thermal desorption technology in isco is less commonly used in practice and its setup is more complex than that of a single technology solution before implementing solutions practical engineering should apply numerical simulations for the best remediation results zhang et al 2020b to design an environment friendly and efficient isco remediation solution this study selected a common organic contaminant aniline an to realize the following research objectives 1 to establish cor apparent reaction and obtain reagent pollutant reaction ratios in the laboratory experiments 2 to construct an htc multi field coupled model to quantify the isco remediation processes

and interfaces from the finite element solution principle ma et al 2022 santonastaso et al 2018 2 2 laboratory experimental setup and simulated scenarios a series of laboratory experiments were set up to determine the reaction ratios between remediation agents and contaminants and the apparent chemical reaction equations aniline is a typical contaminant containing nitrogen and it is also a prominent organic contaminant in the site remediation of this study anotai et al 2011 sodium persulfate a highly efficient and easy to operate chemical was selected as the oxidant and naoh solution was the activator therefore alkaline activated persulfate was called the chemical oxidative remediation agent in this study hussain et al 2014 mustapha et al 2021 the agents included sodium persulfate na2s2o8 99 aniline c6h7n 98 sodium hydroxide naoh 98 5 phosphoric acid h3po4 98 5 meoh ch3oh hplc grade 1 reaction ratio measurement experiments at the beginning of the experiment changing the ph to 11 by adding naoh solution into 1 0 mmol l aniline solution to stabilize the oxidation reaction environment to weaken and ignore the uncertain influence of the amount of activator used on the restoration reaction process then the reaction flask was added with ps stock solution and the reaction flask was then placed in a constant temperature water bath to react two sets of water bath temperatures high temperature 80 c and low temperature 20 c were set to explore the impact of temperature on the reaction ratios ma et al 2020 the specific experiment scheme is shown in table 1 after a specific time 0 5 ml reaction solution was taken the reaction was quenched using the same volume of meoh and analyzed within two hours using high performance liquid chromatography hplc the specific analytical conditions were 0 1 phosphate buffer of 95 h2o and 5 meoh a flow rate of 0 8 ml min and a detection wavelength of 253 nm by fitting the peak areas of aniline solutions at 0 25 0 5 0 75 1 0 and 2 0 mmol l to the aniline concentrations to obtain a standard curve the plotted peak areas were compared with the standard curve to obtain the amount of contaminant remediation to calculate the reaction ratio 2 kinetic thermodynamic parameters measurement experiments temperature controlled experiments can obtain the key kinetic thermodynamic coupling parameters required for multi field coupling modeling e g apparent activation energy frequency factor and reaction enthalpy this study arranged multiple experiments with two contaminant concentrations and five thermal conditions the initial concentration of ps was 2 0 mmol l and the contaminant concentration ct was measured every 10 min the ratio of ct to the initial contaminant concentration c0 was the normalized contaminant concentration the ln ct c0 an t relationship curves under different temperature conditions can be obtained after taking the negative logarithm by assuming that the apparent activation energy is a constant in the experimental temperature range the apparent activation energy of the aniline contamination cor reaction can be obtained by fitting the arrhenius equation the specific experiment scheme is shown in table 1 2 3 site experiment of isco remediation the isco remediation site in nanjing jiangsu province is an abandoned chemical plant site adjacent to the yangtze river after conducting a site environmental investigation and risk assessment according to the differences in the complexity and extent of region pollution the contaminated site was divided into isco remediation areas green and ex situ remediation areas red as shown in fig 1 most of the site is an ex situ remediation area there are two isco remediation areas a smaller area in the southwest corner of the site and a narrow area in the east groundwater belongs to loose rock pore phreatic water which receives recharge from precipitation and discharges through runoff and evaporation the overall groundwater flow direction of the site is from east to west during the simulation and monitoring period the actual remediation project only conducted remediation reagent injection and corresponding monitoring in the northern of the in situ remediation area therefore the 10 m southward extension of the injection area of the remediation agent was selected as the simulation boundary and the boundary of the adjacent ex situ remediation area on the west side was selected as the simulation boundary and the northern and eastern boundaries are taken to the confining boundaries due to the presence of waterproof curtains the above ranges are used as the simulation area of this model as the dark green area in fig 1 the initial pollution plume was distributed in the northern and southern parts of the simulation area therefore two different well placement schemes were designed as shown in fig 1 a remediation well rw cluster with one monitoring well was set based on the center of the contamination plume nine wells were set in the northern rw cluster with an average interval of 5 m the rw was set in the center of the contamination plume with a concentration of 177 μg l monitoring well j2 was set in the northern part of the contamination plume seven wells were set in the southern rw cluster and monitoring well j1 was set in the center of the contamination plume with a concentration of 68 μg l the two well deployment schemes can be used to study the remediation effect of different parts of the contaminated plume the site is flat with an elevation range of about 9 01 11 11 m the simulated area can be generalized into two layers of the phreatic aquifer and relative aquitard in the vertical direction the setting temperature is the average daily temperature 5 c of the actual injection month december in the area the site locates in the area of river terraces sandy beaches and shallow ditches the natural soil is yellow brown loam the terraces are distributed with loess like sub clay the beaches and ditches are distributed with clay and silt and the underlying bedrock is a sandy conglomerate the physical and chemical property parameters of the site soil are shown in table 2 the site strata are mainly filled layers including miscellaneous fill and plain fill and chalky clay layers groundwater is mainly stored in the fill layers the permeability coefficients of each layer are shown in table 3 during the actual isco remediation the oxidizing agent also reacts with the reducing substances in the soil and generates additional consumption called soil oxidant demand sod and is usually related to the soil type and organic mass content marcon et al 2021 the experiment was conducted for 25 days and monitored on day 11 and the temperature was the ambient temperature sod was measured in the non contaminated area of the site and the results showed that the sod measured using naoh activated persulfate as the remediation agent was 3 390 0 022 g of ps per 1 kg of soil consumed the consumption is generated in the natural environment and other factors also affect the ps such as self decay and biological effects the isco remediation area on the site s east side is about 2714 5 m2 and the media volume is about 10 586 5 m3 i e 17 997 2 kg the average mass of ps added to each 1 kg of soil in the actual site remediation process is about 6 69 g so the ps reacting with the target contaminant after consuming soil organic matter and other reducing substances accounts for about 49 3 of the total injection volume the primary rate constant of the ps hydrolysis reaction is 3 7 10 4 d 1 so the contribution of hydrolysis consumption is negligible house 1962 the number of remediation chemicals injected in this simulation was set as 49 3 of the actual construction injection amount of the site to simulate the additional consumption of ps by sod in the actual remediation process and ultimately reduce the influence of the isco remediation on the accuracy of the model bortone et al 2019 ranc et al 2016 fang et al 2018 determined the sod values of persulfate depletion in typical soils of various regions in china and obtained the half life of ps in various types of soils the half life of yellow brown soil in nanjing is 16 9 1 6 days which is consistent with the experiment result based on the apparent chemical equations of remediation reactions obtained from the laboratory experiments and combined with the contamination extent of aniline in the simulated area the ratio of site remediation reagents formulated by mass was controlled to be approximately na2s2o8 naoh 5 2 with the ps concentration of about 0 84 mol l lominchar et al 2018 in the engineering design the rws are combined with the actual situation concerning the diamond shaped deployment scheme two monitoring wells are set upstream and downstream of the groundwater flow as shown in fig 2 a the diameter of the rws is about 63 mm and the influence radius of each agent injection well is approximately 3 m the site was sampled before the remediation background value and on day 3 day 5 day 7 and day 11 after the remediation the 3d model of the simulation area is shown in fig 2 the west side of the simulation area is the water flow outlet boundary the south side is the constant head boundary the top boundary receives infiltration recharge from atmospheric precipitation and the recharge rate is about 3 5 10 4 m d the north east and bottom boundaries are impermeable 2 4 numerical experiments site remediation simulations verified the effectiveness of the multi field coupling model for predicting contaminant changes during the remediation process to further optimize the pollution remediation techniques this study designed a scheme of coupled heating wells and chemical oxidation rws and constructed a 3d model according to the site stratigraphic structure the isco remediation simulation coupling with thermal desorption technology was carried out on this basis bryck 2014 shi et al 2019 this model can be applied as a fundamental unit for deploying well clusters and large scale simulations at present there are very few studies of this technique ma et al 2018 the organic contamination site is generalized as a two layer inhomogeneous phreatic aquifer with a 2 m thick medium sand in the upper layer and a 3 m thick fine sand in the lower layer the overall geometry is 50 m 25 m 5 m length width height an rw was installed in the center of the site with a diameter of 13 cm and a depth of 4 5 m moreover four heating wells with a diameter of 15 cm and a depth of 4 5 m were arranged in a square quadrilateral pattern around the chemical injection well three points p1 p2 and p3 with x coordinates of 26 5 30 and 40 respectively were selected as model observation points in the east direction positive direction of the x axis of the remediation agent injection well the wells were all 15 cm in diameter and 4 5 m in depth as shown in fig 3 in the hydrodynamic field the west side of the simulation area is a constant head boundary with a head of 4 5 m the east side is a surface river set with a constant head boundary with a head of 3 8 m assuming that the top is covered with waterproof insulation material limiting evaporation and atmospheric precipitation recharge the top and bottom north and south sides are confining boundaries the groundwater recharges the river on the east side flowing from west to east in the thermal field the initial temperature of the aquifer system is set to 20 c the north west and south boundary of the simulation area are set with constant temperatures of 20 c 15 c and 20 c respectively the east side is the heat outflow boundary to simulate the heat exchange accompanied by convection during the ground surface water interaction the top of the site is a heat insulated boundary i e the heat flux is 0 the bottom of the model is generalized to a constant temperature boundary with ignoring the effect of the ground temperature gradient and the temperature is set to 20 c in the chemical field the east and west sides of the model are solute exchange boundaries and the rest of the boundaries are flux less boundaries the simulated aquifer system is set as two layers the upper layer is composed of medium sand and the lower layer is composed of fine sand and then given empirical parameters for its hydraulics and thermodynamics meanwhile based on the kinetic thermodynamic experimental results of the aniline cor reaction the apparent frequency factor a a n f the apparent activation energy e a n f enthalpy h a n of cor reaction of aniline in the model was obtained and the relevant parameters are shown in table 4 3 results 3 1 cor reaction apparent parameters and thermal effects before conducting cor reaction laboratory experiments a standard curve for plotting the ratio of peak area hplc to aniline concentration is first obtained so that the concentration of aniline can be quantified directly by peak area and the obtained regression equation y 3 560 187 92553x with r2 0 9998 x represents the aniline concentration and y represents the plotted peak area the standard curve is the foundation for the following experiments 1 reaction ratio measurement experiments the normalized concentration of aniline is the ratio of the measured concentration ant to the initial concentration an0 then the variation curve with the experimental time demonstrates the extent of the reaction as shown in fig 4 the excess aniline in the experiment allowed for a more accurate result of the reaction ratios and ant an0 is stable in the 0 9 to 0 95 as shown in fig 4 the difference between ant an0 at low and high temperatures is slight indicating that the effect of temperature on the cor reaction ratio is slight the two experiments results showed that ps of about 19 45 and 19 88 mol were required for each mol of aniline consumed at low 20 c and high 80 c respectively the apparent chemical reaction equation could be written as an 20ps product in addition the aniline concentration decreases fast at high temperatures and is more stable after the decrease which indicates that high temperatures can accelerate the cor rate and improve the restoration effect 2 kinetic thermodynamic parameters measurement experiments fig 5 shows the variation of ant an0 in the cor process at different temperatures the decomposition rates of aniline are different for the initial aniline concentration excess an0 250 mg l and non excess an0 10 mg l conditions when an0 10 mg l and the experimental temperature was between 5 c and 40 c ant an0 was greater than 0 9 the reaction degree was low and the difference was insignificant when t 60 c the reaction degree was greatly improved however in the first 20 min of the experiment its reaction rate was low i e the reaction started slowly when t 70 c its reaction degree and reaction rate was significantly increased after an0 was increased to 250 mg l the overall degradation of aniline decreased significantly compared with the low initial concentration the reaction rate was slow and increased gradually with the increase in temperature the divergence of aniline decomposition at different temperature conditions occurs at two time points the first one is t 10 min and ant an0 starts to decrease at medium high temperatures t 40 c while the changes are not evident at low temperatures t 5 c t 20 c the second shunt occurred at t 45 min and ant an0 decreased rapidly at high temperatures t 60 c t 70 c while ant an0 changed slowly at medium temperatures t 40 c the calculation results were much smaller than the low initial concentration group see table 5 the apparent activation energy varied less in the experimental temperature range it could be approximated as a constant the apparent activation energy of the chemical oxidation of aniline pollution remediation reaction by ps at an0 10 mg l was obtained as 85 94 kj mol and the apparent frequency factor was 2 70 1011 m60 s mol20 by fitting the arrhenius equation the apparent activation energy is 79 64 kj mol and an apparent frequency factor is 5 85 109 m60 s mol20 at an0 250 mg l which are smaller than the corresponding fitted calculation results of the low initial concentration group these factors will be applied as essential parameters in the model setup the reaction enthalpy for the chemical oxidation of aniline by ps is mainly based on the standard molar enthalpy of each substance assuming the reaction equation mustapha et al 2021 s2o2 8 c6h7n 15h2o 2so2 4 2h 6co2 h no 3 17h2 the reaction enthalpy is 1157 1 kj mol and the reaction is exothermic 3 2 isco remediation agents distribution and remediation effects verification the period of isco remediation simulation is set to 11 days which is consistent with the site s monitoring time the ps simulation distribution on day 11 is shown in fig 6 the ps plume in the northern site is distributed in a point pattern the concentration distribution of each plume is similar and the control range of the remediation agent is large in contrast the injecting ps in the southern site is connected to a single plume and its remediation agent concentration is higher due to the lower concentration of the southern contamination plume as shown in fig 7 the measured aniline concentration at j1 gradually decreased after the remediation agent injection the decrease at the early remediation stage would be more significant due to a certain distance from the initial contaminated area of aniline the contaminant did not spread to j2 at the beginning of remediation therefore the aniline was not available before day 4 after that aniline was transported with water flow and the aniline concentration gradually increased due to the influence of pollution diffusion at j2 being more significant at monitoring point j2 the aniline concentration reaches a peak around day 8 the initial concentration in the center of the pollution plume is high while the peak concentration is only 20 μg l under the dual effect of diffusion and remediation which is still higher than the less contaminated monitoring point j1 then the aniline concentration decreases rapidly due to the fixed total amount of contaminant sources the contamination diffusion effect continues to weaken and the remediation effect is stable it could be found that the concentration change curve obtained from the simulation is consistent with the actual monitoring values of aniline concentration which confirms the effectiveness of the multi field coupling model used in predicting the change in contaminant concentration during the isco remediation 3 3 influence of thermal desorption coupling on isco remediation based on the above conceptual model a circular aniline contaminated area with a radius of 2 5 m and an initial concentration of 0 25 mol m3 was established in the center of the site and the rws were continuously injected with ps remediation agent with a concentration of 2 5 mol m3 for 200 days the heating well temperatures tw were set to 30 c 50 c 70 c and 90 c respectively simulations were conducted to obtain the distributions of aniline and remediation reaction products so2 4 on days 60 120 and 200 under different temperature conditions as shown in figs 8 and 9 at the early stage of remediation 60 days the difference in concentration distribution between aniline and remediation reaction products under different heating well temperatures was slight and the thermal field s coupling effect was not significant the aniline concentration was lower and the residual range was smaller under high temperature conditions by the 120th day in contrast the concentration of the remediation reaction products was higher and the migration and diffusion range gradually expanded at the end of the remediation day 200 the aniline concentration and residual range decreased with the increase of heating well temperature and the reaction product concentration and migration diffusion range gradually increased as shown in fig 8 the remediation of aniline is highly influential within the area surrounded by the heating wells however the remediation of surrounding areas under the influence of solute migration and diffusion is the core problem in solving contamination therefore the observation point p2 is used as the observation target and the changes in the aniline and remediation reaction product are shown in fig 10 the simulation results showed that the aniline concentration at p2 gradually increased in the early stage due to the upstream solute migration and diffusion the difference in aniline concentration under different heating well temperature conditions was slight with the extension of heating time the concentration of aniline at p2 decreased significantly due to the chemical oxidation reaction this stage 60 120 days was also the significant time when the difference in aniline concentration widened under different temperature conditions which was caused by the high temperature increases in the rate of remediation reaction the reaction product concentration also increases in this process but in the late stage the reaction product slowly decreases due to the influence of diffusion the aniline concentration at p2 at tw 90 c was only 29 3 of that at tw 30 c on day 200 and the former s remediation reaction rate was 1 6 times higher than the latter overall the high temperature coupling effect can strengthen the in situ chemical oxidative remediation of aniline contaminated groundwater with ps and improve the remediation efficiency when quantitatively characterizing the in situ chemical oxidative remediation process under high temperature strengthening conditions such as thermal desorption considering the coupling effect and influence of the temperature field is necessary 4 discussion in the previous section determining the impact of heating well temperature on the remediation effect was complicated due to the variation of aniline concentration a new model was developed under the above conceptual model settings to simulate the variation of seepage and temperature fields at various heating well temperatures excluding aniline contamination sun et al 2021 waldemer et al 2007 the new model will be utilized to examine the impact of temperature and solute variation of agents on contamination remediation 4 1 thermal desorption changes the hydrodynamic process in site remediation the injection wells were continuously injected with remediation chemicals of 30 mol m3 for 60 days with a constant temperature for the heated wells tw the simulation observed the variation of darcy velocity at observation point p1 and the variation of water flow rate at the downstream river boundary under different tw conditions as shown in fig 11 due to the high specific heat capacity and latent heat water absorbs heat more quickly than soil during the heating leading to a change in properties wang et al 2019 if the chemical reaction between remediation agents and contaminants is not considered and the influence of temperature on dispersion is neglected the effect of the thermal field on the chemical field is mainly observed through its indirect effect on solute migration and diffusion by changing the hydrodynamic field the darcy velocity at observation point p1 showed a trend of decreasing and then increasing during the simulation period see fig 11a the higher the tw the greater the variation of the darcy velocity at p1 the increasing darcy velocity at tw 90 c on day 200 compared to that at tw 30 c was about 16 7 the density and dynamic viscosity of the fluid decreased when the temperature increased combined with the simulation results of the water flux at the downstream channel boundary fig 11b it can be found that the water flux also showed decreasing first and then increased the total groundwater flux increased by about 4 1 in 200 days when the tw raised from 30 to 90 c under the model setting conditions the density decrease has a more significant impact on the overall change of the darcy velocity than the reduction of the dynamic fluid viscosity in the first part of the simulation period so the darcy velocity tends to decrease in the middle and late parts the reduction of the dynamic viscosity affects the darcy velocity more than the density so the darcy velocity gradually increases the higher the temperature the greater the increase the darcy velocity increase correlates with the heating well temperature increase which ultimately affects the water flux the range of high temperature area becomes wide as the tw increases resulting in a significant increase in water flux at the downstream boundary there is a significant difference in the diffusion range of aniline at different temperatures see fig 8 the increasing temperature expands the diffusion range of aniline the transport of pollution beyond the control range of the remediation agent with water flow and generating the contamination trailing at the end of the remediation process although high temperature conditions improved the remediation efficiency they also expanded the distribution range of residual contamination the trailing effect is a common challenge in groundwater remediation which needs to be further emphasized bryck 2014 4 2 the influence process of thermal desorption on thermal chemical fields the change in the thermal chemical fields can intuitively reflect the relationship between temperature remediation agent and restoration effect the thermal field distribution in the simulation differs particularly under different tw and the thermal field changes less in the early stage see fig 12 the influence of tw on the overall migration and dispersion of remediation agents is slight as the extended heating time expanded the range of high temperature zones and increased the groundwater flow rate the effects of the thermal field on the migration and dispersion of remediation agents gradually became apparent the simulation results in fig 13 showed that on day 100 the differences in the migration and diffusion ranges of the remediation agents under different heating well temperature conditions were slight however on day 200 as the tw increased the central concentration decreased and the temperature distribution difference become more pronounced the migration and diffusion ranges of the remediation agents were more prominent at higher heating well temperatures however affected by flow velocity changes the central concentrations of the remediation agents decreased significantly at higher temperatures to make the results representative the three monitoring points in fig 3 were used to quantify the change in drug concentration the concentrations at different temperatures at the three observation points are shown in table 6 the monitoring points p1 and p2 are close to the heating well first affected by thermal desorption the higher the temperature of the heating well tw the faster the flow and the more substantial the dilution of remediation agents the closer the heating well the longer the heating time and the more significant the decrease in the concentration of the remediation agent compared to the maximum heating well temperature 90 c the concentration of remediation agents at p1 was about 10 9 lower under the minimum heating well temperature 30 c while the concentration of remediation agents at p2 was only about 7 1 lower on day 100 on day 200 the concentration decreased by 17 3 and 14 8 respectively unlike p1 and p2 the monitoring point p3 is located far from the heating well and at the edge of the ps migration diffusion range therefore with the increase in the temperature of the heating well and the heating time the concentration of the remediation agent at p3 increases gradually meanwhile the diffusion range and the remediation agent migration increase simultaneously the laboratory experiments have demonstrated that high temperature conditions increase the degree of contaminant agent reaction which is the hydrochemical mechanism of thermal desorption enhancing isco the numerical simulation demonstrates the thermodynamic mechanism that changes the percolation velocity and diffuses the solute by increasing the temperature thus enhancing the contaminant agent contact this study further illustrates the complexity of isco remediation processes and its internal mechanism deserves continuous attention 5 conclusions this paper studied the mechanism of optimizing isco remediation for organically contaminated groundwater meanwhile quantified the cor reaction processes by the conceptional model laboratory experiments and practical project verification the results elaborated on the phenomenon and mechanism of thermal coupling enhancement of isco in hydrochemistry and thermodynamics and demonstrated the ability to remediate contamination the laboratory experiments revealed an apparent reaction equation with the reference value and thermal effect activation energy frequency factor and reaction enthalpy obtained between the aniline and ps and the hydrochemical causes of temperature affect the remediation effect i e high temperature enhances the degree of reaction the site remediation and simulation provided the actual soil and hydrodynamic parameters for the htc multi field coupling model combined with the contamination monitoring data and the effectiveness of the model in predicting the remediation effect was verified in addition the remediation results of the two well placement scenarios show that decentralizing the rw in the center of the contamination plume and the surrounding area allows for more effective remediation of aniline contamination and also avoids secondary contamination from remediation agent residues a new thermal desorption coupled isco remediation model with heating wells was established the results showed that adding heating wells can enhance the restoration effect and expand the remediation well impact area the restoration effect increases with increasing heating well temperature and heating time analysis from the perspective of the mechanism the heating wells directly impact the seepage and temperature fields increasing the temperature and solution flow rate in the remediation area and accelerating the diffusion of contaminants and remediation agents while the remediation area is expanded the contaminants are diluted and contact the remediation agent more thoroughly these two remediation principles and their influence factors were verified and discussed by non reactive transport simulations the combination of the thermal desorption technique and isco remediation should be further applied to remediation engineering to improve remediation efficiency and shorten the remediation cycle the quantitative simulation and the multi field coupling model s prediction can precisely reduce the chemical injection and avoid secondary pollution in the actual projects data availability data will be made available on request credit authorship contribution

14756,thallium tl is a trace metal with extreme toxicity and is highly soluble in water posing a great risk to ecological and human safety this work aimed to investigate the role played by tl in regulating lipid accumulation in microalgae and the removal efficiency of tl the effect of tl on the cell growth lipid production and tl removal efficiency of parachlorella kessleri r 3 was studied low concentrations of tl had no significant effect on the biomass of microalgae when the tl concentration exceeded 5 μg l 1 the biomass of microalgae showed significant decrease the highest lipid content of 63 65 and lipid productivity of 334 55 mg l 1 d 1 were obtained in microalgae treated with 10 and 5 μg l 1 tl respectively microalgae can efficiently remove tl and the tl removal efficiency can reach 100 at tl concentrations of 0 25 μg l 1 the maximum nitric oxide no level of 470 48 fluorescence intensity 1 106 cells 1 and glutathione gsh content of 343 51 nmol g 1 fresh alga were obtained under 5 μg l 1 tl stress conditions furthermore the exogenous donor sodium nitroprusside snp supplemented with no was induced in microalgae to obtain a high lipid content 59 99 lipid productivity 397 99 mg l 1 d 1 and gsh content 430 22 nmol g 1 fresh alga the corresponding analysis results indicated that no could participate in the signal transduction pathway through modulation of reactive oxygen species ros signaling to activate the antioxidant system by increasing the gsh content to eliminate oxidative damage induced by tl stress in addition no regulation of ros signaling may enhance transcription factors associated with lipid synthesis which stimulates the expression of genes related to lipid synthesis leading to increased lipid biosynthesis in microalgae moreover it was found that the change in tl had little effect on the fatty acid components and biodiesel properties this study showed that tl stress can promote lipid accumulation in microalgae for biodiesel production and simultaneously effectively remove tl which provided evidence that no was involved in signal transduction and antioxidant defense and improved the understanding of the interrelation between no and ros to regulate lipid accumulation in microalgae graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords thallium biodiesel nitric oxide heavy metal parachlorella kessleri r 3 biological treatment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction thallium tl is a highly toxic heavy metal that is commonly distributed in nature and can seriously pollute the water environment thallium is present in approximately one third of the world with most countries in asia having thallium pollution problems and as many as 160 thallium containing minerals have been identified including thallium oxides thallium compounds and thallium containing minerals li et al 2020b rajendran et al 2022 thallium can cause damage to human health even at very low concentrations there have been several deaths in some countries due to malignant diseases caused by thallium containing water contamination as thallium is harmful to humans and highly hydrophilic it is easily absorbed by the skin and causes toxic dermatitis which can lead to death if left untreated li et al 2020a rajendran et al 2022 thallium in nature mainly has a 1 valence or 3 valence but tl3 has strong oxidation and is easily reduced to tl li et al 2020a moreover tl is mainly present as tl in most water and wastewater indicating that the treatment difficulty in water wastewater containing tl is the removal of tl tl is soluble in water and extremely difficult to eliminate in the human body which poses a serious risk to human health and the ecological environment birungi and chirwa 2017 the main techniques used for tl removal are adsorption ion exchange oxidation reduction precipitation and solvent extraction among which adsorption is of great interest due to its simplicity li et al 2020a xu et al 2019 the removal of tl from wastewater using sulfate reducing bacteria embedded in a polyvinyl alcohol alginate matrix as a biosorbent was investigated by zhang et al 2017 liu et al suggested that mnfe2o4 biochar composites show highly efficient removal of tl from wastewater liu et al 2021 in addition lópez et al stated that a magnetic composite of a prussian blue derivative and magnetite nanoparticles possesses a good adsorption capacity for tl lópez et al 2021 as mentioned above studies on tl removal from water wastewater through adsorption have focused on the use of bacteria and composite materials and there are few studies on the removal of tl using microalgae previous studies have shown the use of microalgae as a sustainable biosorbent to remove heavy metals hms as microalgae have a good ability to remove hms and improve the quality of water bodies cheng et al 2021 ubando et al 2021 zhao et al 2019a microalgae have been increasingly used in the treatment of hm polluted wastewater due to their culturability abundance of resources and fast growth rate kong et al 2022 liu et al 2023 on the other hand compared to higher plants microalgae are highly capable of nitrogen fixation and have a high tolerance to salt and alkali as well as a high photosynthetic efficiency which makes it possible to cultivate them in large quantities for wastewater treatment or other applications budamagunta et al 2023 ren et al 2015 shi et al 2023 zhao et al 2022b kafil et al assessed the removal capacity of cr vi and metabolite production by scenedesmus quadricauda under autotrophy and heterotrophy cultivation systems for synthetic wastewater treatment kafil et al 2022 tripathi and poluri also provided a comprehensive appreciation of the mechanism by which microalgae eliminated oxidative stress and detoxified hms at the transcriptome level tripathi and poluri 2021 the use of microalgae to remove hms from water bodies not only solves the pollution problem but also allows for the accumulated microalgae biomass to be used as potential feedstock for biofuel production singh and mishra 2022 yu et al 2023 microalgae tend to produce more lipids under hms stress conditions song et al 2022b zhao et al 2019a when microalgae are subjected to hms stress the physiological changes are manifested as a large accumulation of reactive oxygen species ros the moderate amount of ros accumulation induced by hms stress may be involved in regulating carbon partitioning and autophagy thereby promoting the lipid accumulation in microalgae zhang et al 2020 in addition hms indirectly trigger oxidative stress by interfering with the production and scavenging of ros in microalgae on the other hand microalgae can also develop corresponding defense mechanisms by synthesizing antioxidant enzymes and antioxidants to scavenge ros induced by hms stress and promote their defense against oxidative damage shao et al 2022 it was demonstrated that some signaling molecules in microalgae are also involved in algal growth lipid production and defense mechanisms under hms stress nitric oxide no is a gaseous small molecule radical and bio signaling molecule for many physiologically active substances and has a variety of biological activities in plants and microalgae li et al 2021 no regulates the growth metabolism and antioxidant systems of microalgae cells to maintain the stability of the intracellular environment domingos et al 2015 correspondingly no is able to upregulate genes of enzymes involved in proline and glutathione biosynthesis so it is suggested that no can medicate the intracellular antioxidant system in plants xu et al 2009 furthermore no is a novel bio signaling molecule that is lipid soluble which can propagate in cells and trigger signaling pathways that lead to the induction of the expression of related resistance genes and regulate defense responses in plants or microalgae through posttranslational altering proteins or through interactions with other signaling molecules meng et al 2022 sami et al 2018 in addition no is participated in the plant response to abiotic stress by promoting dry matter accumulation and reducing lipid peroxidation to reduce salt stress damage to rice thus maintaining ion homeostasis yan et al 2020 thus no plays an essential role in enhancing antioxidant capacity and signal transduction previous studies have also shown that no is an important intermediate part of the marine nitrogen cycle li et al 2021 it is worth noting that hms can be adsorbed by microalgae while hms can stimulate algal cells to produce stress and thereby modulate signal transduction pathways to produce more lipids for biodiesel production zhao et al 2019a however the mechanism by which tl stress regulates the lipid content and intracellular no accumulation in algal cells remains unknown the roles of no signaling and the relationship between no and ros in algal growth lipid production and the antioxidative defense system of microalgae under tl stress also need to be further investigated further elucidation is also needed on the removal of tl by microalgae therefore the effects of tl on the biomass concentration lipid content chemical components pigments carbohydrates and proteins and tl removal efficiency of microalgae were investigated in this study additionally the variations in ros and no signaling in microalgae under tl stress were elucidated furthermore the no donor and scavenger were investigated to determine the role of no signaling on algal growth lipid synthesis and antioxidative defense the association of no and ros signaling in microalgae in response to tl stress was also studied this study provides a novel strategy for lipid accumulation and offers insight into the interrelation between no and ros signaling mediated lipid biosynthesis and tl tolerance in microalgae 2 material and methods 2 1 microalgae and culture conditions the green algae parachlorella kessleri r 3 used in this work was isolated and purified from soil in harbin china as previously reported song et al 2022a algal cells were cultured for 9 days in 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks containing 150 ml bg 11 medium at 25 1 c 150 rpm min 1 and 3500 lx illumination intensity with a 12 h 12 h light dark cycle different concentrations of tl 0 1 5 10 15 and 25 μg l 1 sigma aldrich usa were added to the culture medium glucose 10 g l 1 was used as the only carbon source in the culture medium the initial ph of the culture medium was 6 8 7 0 ren et al 2022 to determine whether no was able to medicate the cell growth and lipid production of p kessleri r 3 to tl stress the nitric oxide donor sodium nitroprusside snp at 100 μm and nitric oxide scavenger carboxy potassium salt c ptio at 5 μm in the presence of 5 μg l 1 tl were used snp and c ptio were purchased from beyotime biotechnology shanghai china 2 2 algal growth and lipid analysis to determine the biomass concentration fresh algal cells were harvested through centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 5 min and washed 2 3 times with distilled water ren et al 2023 the collected algal cells were frozen overnight at 80 c and transferred to a vacuum freeze dryer for 24 h to constant weight the biomass concentration was the final dry weight divided by the algal liquid volume a chloroform methanol mixture 2 1 v v was used to extract the lipids of microalgae based on the modified method by zhao et al 2022c the lipid content and productivity were calculated according to a previous study song et al 2023a 2 3 determination of biochemical components ros level no level and gsh content the total pigment content of microalgae was measured by the methanol method using a previous method shin et al 2017 and detected at 470 652 and 665 nm using a uv spectrophotometer total carbohydrates and proteins of microalgae were extracted using an ultrasound cell crusher at 200 w for 10 min and determined by the phenol sulfuric acid method with glucose as the standard and by the bicinchoninic acid quantification assay kit beyotime biotechnology china with bsa as the standard respectively the ros level of microalgae was detected by 2 7 dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate dcfh da beyotime biotechnology china with an excitation wavelength ex of 488 nm and an emission wavelength em of 525 nm according to song et al 2020 the intracellular no level in the algal cells was measured using 3 amino 4 aminomethyl 2 7 difluorescein diacetate daf fm da beyotime biotechnology china daf fm da can cross cell membranes and can be catalyzed by intracellular esterase to form daf fm which cannot cross cell membranes daf fm itself is only weakly fluorescent and can fluoresce strongly when reacted with nitric oxide with an ex of 495 nm and an em of 515 nm the ros and no levels are shown as the fluorescence intensity per 1 106 cells the reduced glutathione gsh content was extracted and determined by a gsh assay kit suzhou keming biotechnology co ltd china and measured at 412 nm using a uv spectrophotometer by previously described zhao et al 2022a the gsh content is shown in μmol per g fresh alga 2 4 tl concentration and fourier transform infrared ftir analysis the determination of tl ion was carried out using an agilent 7700x instrument agilent usa to conduct inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms using a previous method hao et al 2022 the removal efficiency of tl ion t in the medium as measured by the absorption was calculated according to the following equation t c0 c 100 c0 where c0 and c represent the initial and final tl concentrations of the culture medium respectively for ftir spectroscopy analysis fresh algae cultured for 9 days were centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 5 min the harvested algal cells were washed three times with distilled water and dried the chemical components of the dried algal cells were analyzed by the potassium bromide kbr pellet method using fourier transform infrared spectromet ftir perkinelmer frontier in the mid infrared range 4000 400 cm 1 abinandan et al 2019 2 5 fatty acid methyl ester analysis for transesterification of extracted algal lipids into fatty acid methyl esters fames 2 ml of methanol and sulfuric acid mixture 97 3 v v were added and then incubated at 70 c for 4 h after cooling 2 ml n hexane was added and then

7890a agilent usa equipped with an fid with a 37 component mix of fames as the standard song et al 2019 2 6 statistical analysis all experiments were conducted in triplicate and variability is shown as averages and sd the experimental graphs were plotted using origin 2023b the quantitative and statistical analysis of the experimental data was conducted using microsoft excel 2016 and one way anova by ibm spss ver 25 respectively significant differences were considered at p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of tl exposure on cell growth and lipid biosynthesis of microalgae the algal growth and lipid synthesis cultured with increasing concentrations of tl 0 to 25 μg l 1 are shown in fig 1 as shown in fig 1a adding 1 μg l 1 tl to microalgae cultivation resulted in a biomass concentration of 6 15 g l 1 this indicated that algal cell growth remained stable at low concentrations of tl and the obtained biomass concentration was comparable to that of 0 μg l 1 tl control 6 58 g l 1 at higher tl concentration 5 μg l 1 cell growth showed a negative trend and biomass concentration of 5 67 g l 1 was obtained higher concentrations of tl from 10 to 25 μg l 1 inhibited algal growth which significantly decreased the algal biomass concentration from 69 68 to 82 82 compared with the control fig 1a this observation was consistent with previous results showing that the growth rate of scenedesmus quadricauda decreased when the cr vi concentration increased from 5 to 10 ppm kafil et al 2022 furthermore the change in biomass productivity was similar to that in biomass concentration fig 1b this may be related to the excess ros production in algal cells with increasing tl concentration which results in algal cell death and thus a decrease in biomass it is well known that microalgae are capable of producing ros under stressful environments which can cause oxidative damage to algal cells in particular excessive ros is produced by microalgae under heavy metal stress conditions and in turn inhibit their growth song et al 2022a as the cd2 concentration increased from 100 to 250 μm the growth rate of chlorella sorokiniana was significantly inhibited leon vaz et al 2021 zhao et al 2019a showed that an increase in cd2 concentration from 20 to 80 μm had a negative effect on the cell growth rate which resulted in a lower biomass density of microalgae monoraphidium sp qly 1 furthermore the lipid content increased under tl stress 1 to 10 μg l 1 fig 1a the highest lipid content reached 63 65 in microalgae culture supplemented with 10 μg l 1 tl tl had a positive effect on algal lipid accumulation showing that appropriate oxidative stress of tl could promote high lipid production in the culture medium the lipid productivity of microalgae reached a maximum in the 5 μg l 1 tl treatment and the highest lipid productivity was 334 55 mg l 1 d 1 which was 1 13 fold higher than that of the control group fig 1b overall a certain concentration of tl stress can promote the lipid accumulation in microalgae the results showed that cr vi stress could induce lipid production in parachlorella kessleri r 3 song et al 2022b algae generally tend to decrease cell growth under stress conditions and algal cell metabolism shifts toward lipid synthesis and accumulation nanda et al 2021 zhao et al reported that lipid synthesis in monoraphidium sp increased at 40 μm cd2 compared to the control zhao et al 2019a the removal efficiencies under different concentrations of tl were also evaluated table s1 the microalgae p kessleri r 3 was able to remove 100 of tl from 1 to 25 μg l 1 after nine days of culture these findings indicated that p kessleri r 3 was a potential biosorbent for the removal of tl considering the biomass lipid productivity and tl removal efficiency 5 μg l 1 tl was chosen as the stress concentration for subsequent study the biomass concentration lipid content and tl removal efficiency of microalgae under the optimal tl concentration of 5 μg l 1 was monitored throughout the culture phase fig 2 as illustrated in fig 2a an increase in culture time positively affected algal growth leading to the highest biomass concentration on the ninth day the highest microalgae biomass concentration of 6 02 g l 1 was achieved in the control group furthermore a microalgae biomass concentration of 5 97 g l 1 was observed in the presence of 5 μg l 1 tl which was slightly less than that of the control this showed that p kessleri r 3 had good tolerance to tl in addition to biomass concentration the lipid content of microalgae was also measured to assess the algal response to tl at 5 μg l 1 as presented in fig 2b the lipid content of the control group and tl treatment group increased first in the early stage of culture the highest lipid content 67 02 was obtained in the presence of 5 μg l 1 tl on day 3 which was 1 13 times higher than that of the control furthermore the lipid content of microalgae in the presence of 5 μg l 1 tl slightly decreased and then became stable at the end of cultivation fig 2b microalgae tend to accumulate more lipids because this can protect themselves from stress damage song et al 2022a thus tl treatment could promote lipid production in microalgae the positive effect of lipid synthesis under heavy metal stress has been previously demonstrated zhao et al studied microalgae exposed to cd2 20 80 μm and obtained lipid contents of 47 07 52 78 zhao et al 2019a under 0 5 mg l 1 cr vi treatment lipid accumulation in the oleaginous microalga chlorella sp significantly increased and the highest lipid content of 54 17 was achieved liu et al 2017 the potential of algae to withstand environmental stresses and adapt to stressful conditions has been confirmed by some previous studies ali et al 2020 ji et al 2018 although the initial concentration of tl in the culture medium was relatively low this dose may pose a threat to human health if exposed to water bodies to identify the tl removed by microalgae tl removal efficiency was measured during the culture period fig 2c the removal efficiency of tl on day 3 was 56 07 further increasing the culture time up to day 9 the removal efficiency of tl reached 100 during the culture period culture time affected the removal of tl with increasing culture time 100 removal of tl can be achieved the improvement of tl removal efficiency may be due to some chemical groups such as oh and coo on the surface of algal cells chai et al 2021 pradhan et al 2019 ftir is an infrared spectroscopic technique of absorption emission or photoconduction over a broad spectral range and its spectra can reveal the vibrational patterns of atomic bonds and thus the main chemical groups of molecules cui and kerekes 2018 gu et al 2014 li et al 2022 the functional groups of organic compounds have been identified using ftir and the structural alterations of chemicals in algal cells have been predicted abinandan et al 2019 ftir spectra of microalgae under tl stress is shown in fig 2d the peak in the region 2925 cm 1 corresponded to the asymmetric elongation vibrations of ch containing aliphatic ch2 and ch3 groups indicating the characteristic peaks of carbohydrates and lipids the peaks in the 1650 cm 1 and 1550 cm 1 regions were attributed to the superposition of the c o typical stretching vibrations of the amide i band and the ch and cn stretching vibrations of the amide ii band associated with the protein 1200 900 cm 1 is associated with the vibrational stretching of coh and ch and the characteristic peaks of polysaccharides shou et al 2018 the intensity of the peak is closely related to the concentration of functional groups in the sample and reflects the relative concentration of functional groups although the position of the characteristic peaks of the functional groups was almost unchanged under tl stress the intensity of some spectral peaks increased after tl stress such as c o ch and cn the increase in the concentrations of these electronegative functional groups can make algal cells more easily combine with heavy metal ions thus efficiently removing tl li et al 2020c 3 2 effect of tl exposure on the chemical components of microalgae the changes in the chemical components pigments proteins and carbohydrates exposed to tl stress were also essential indicators for assessing the state of algal cells the pigment content chlorophyll a chlorophyll b and carotenoid of p kessleri r 3 cultivated in the tl containing culture medium was investigated throughout the cultivation phase the chlorophyll a content of microalgae cultured in the presence of 5 μg l 1 tl increased slightly with cultivation time fig 3 a the highest chlorophyll a content in the control and 5 μg l 1 tl treatment groups reached 27 01 and 27 39 mg l 1 on day 9 respectively there was no significant difference comparing the control group with the tl treatment group p 0 05 and the changes in chlorophyll a content were consistent with the growth of microalgae chlorophyll a has been shown to be closely associated with growth in microalgae ji et al 2018 zhao et al also assessed the growth of microalgae by measuring chlorophyll a in monoraphidium sp zhao et al 2019a the chlorophyll b content under tl treatment was comparable to that of control group throughout the cultivation phase fig 3a on the other hand the carotenoid content in the control group and tl treatment group showed a trend of first increasing and then decreasing with minor differences a much higher carotenoid content of 4 98 mg l 1 was obtained on day 5 for the tl treatment group carotenoids play different roles in the metabolism and growth of plants or microalgae first as auxiliary pigments in photosynthetic photosynthesis and as precursors for the synthesis of signaling molecules such as abscisic acid and β cyclocitral thus playing an important role in the cell growth and stress response of plants or microalgae felemban et al 2019 kromdijk et al 2016 however the mechanisms underlying the changes in carotenoid content under tl stress still need to be further investigated apart from synthesizing lipids microalgae can also produce other high value biomacromolecules such as proteins and carbohydrates the protein content under tl treatment significantly decreased from 25 01 to 7 66 during the first three days of cultivation fig 3b in addition exposure to tl stress significantly decreased the carbohydrate content at the initial cultivation and then the carbohydrate content slightly decreased at the later stage of cultivation fig 3c in previous reports the protein and carbohydrate contents under abiotic stress conditions in monoraphidium sp sharply decreased at the initial culture phase li et al 2017 zhao et al recorded that the carbohydrate content decreased significantly from 18 68 to 10 79 on the first day of induction which was accompanied by a rapid accumulation of lipids zhao et al 2019a the protein and carbohydrate contents in microalgae are closely related to carbon flow and tl stress could regulate carbon reallocation which might be used to biosynthesize more lipids qiao et al 2022 3 3 effect of tl exposure on no ros levels and gsh content of microalgae no and ros have been considered as important signaling molecules in algal cells particularly under adverse conditions and are involved in signal transduction pathways regulating the defense response of algal cells under stressful conditions signorelli et al 2019 therefore the intracellular no and ros levels of p kessleri r 3 under tl stress conditions and in the control were assessed fig 4 a and 4b the no level gradually increased with increasing culture time under tl stress reaching the highest fluorescence intensity of 470 48 fluorescence intensity 1 106 cells 1 on the fifth day and then gradually began to decrease over time fig 4a in addition the no level under tl treatment was significantly higher than that under the control which may be due to the stimulatory effect of stress this may be related to the involvement of no in the response to tl stress similar results were also found in rice where endogenous no levels were increased under salt stress conditions yan et al 2020 ding et al showed that the no level of haematococcus pluvialis increased upon exposure to high light conditions ding et al 2018 an increase in the no level has also been suggested to enhance the algal defense response under abiotic stress conditions by activating the antioxidant system in algal cells through signal transduction song et al 2019 microalgae tend to produce a certain level of ros under stress conditions fig 4b shows that the ros level increased during the pre mid culture phase in algal cells under tl stress and then showed significant decrease p 0 05 the highest ros level of 344 38 fluorescence intensity 1 106 cells 1 was observed on day 7 which was significantly higher than the control 144 64 fluorescence intensity 1 106 cells 1 fig 4b a certain level of ros production may be associated with the rapid accumulation of lipids ros is central to multiple signaling networks in algal cells and play a dual role in lipid production mediating cellular stress responses and enhancing lipid accumulation zhang et al 2020 ros have been demonstrated by wang et al to mediate the transition from carbohydrate storage to lipid synthesis in chlorella protothecoides through signaling networks wang et al 2016 the content of gsh in algal cells was also investigated which was involved in the cellular response to tl stress along with the increase in ros levels under stress conditions the gsh content exhibited a corresponding increase the gsh content in p kessleri r 3 with 5 μg l 1 tl treatment was significantly increased and the highest gsh content was 343 51 nmol g 1 fresh alga on day 3 fig 4c the increase in gsh content was beneficial to the antioxidant defense system of algal cells as an important regulatory substance in algal cells gsh has antioxidant and integrative detoxification effects which guarantee the normal function of proteins and enzymes to protect algal cells from ros damage zhang et al 2020 qiao et al also found an increase in gsh content in microalgae to eliminate ros production due to salinity stress qiao et al 2021 as a precursor of phytochelatin no can promote the increase in gsh content in medicago truncatula roots by enhancing the high expression of gamma glutamylcysteine synthetase γ ecs and glutathione synthetase gsh genes and improve its resistance to heavy metal stress innocenti et al 2007 3 4 no modulated algal growth lipid accumulation no level and gsh content by regulating ros signaling in the presence of tl to further understand the relationship between intracellular no level and ros in the induction of lipid accumulation in response to tl stress the effects of no biosynthesis donor snp and scavenger c ptio on algal growth lipid production no ros level and gsh content on day 9 were investigated when snp was added to the tl treatment group the biomass concentration and productivity 5 91 g l 1 and 645 56 mg l 1 d 1 of microalgae were comparable to those in the tl treatment group alone 5 90 g l 1 and 644 86 mg l 1 d 1 moreover when c ptio was added to the tl treatment group the cell growth of microalgae was significantly inhibited and the biomass concentration productivity reached 3 85 g l 1 416 94 mg l 1 d 1 table 1 this may be because the addition of no donors cannot directly participate in the regulation of microalgae growth but the removal of no directly affects algal growth gupta et al 2022 similar snp may be involved in co2 assimilation which in turn affects the cell growth and development li et al 2021 further investigation is needed on the role of snp in the regulation of algal growth snp combined with tl stress had significant impact on the lipid accumulation of p kessleri r 3 correspondingly the highest lipid content productivity of 59 99 397 99 mg l 1 d 1 with snp combined with tl stress was achieved which was higher than that of the tl stress group 50 81 333 12 mg l 1 d 1 however lipid synthesis was significantly decreased in the c ptio combined with tl stress group the results of algal growth and lipid synthesis indicated that no was an essential signaling molecule which in turn affected the lipid accumulation of p kessleri r 3 under tl stress the addition of snp and c ptio to the tl group is necessary for the detection and analysis of intracellular no levels as shown in fig 5 a the no level of the snp combined with tl stress group was significantly higher than those of the other treatment groups the no level was 1 71 1 50 2 00 and 1 53 times that of the control tl stress tl combined with c ptio and tl combined with snp and c ptio groups respectively to confirm the stimulatory effect of snp treatment as a result of no production the no scavenger c ptio was applied together with snp fig 5a the results suggested that snp can significantly increase no levels while c ptio was effective in removing no from algal cells according to liu et al snp treatment also raised the no level in trifolium repens l as well as their antioxidant content and antioxidant enzyme activity which reduced the toxicity of cadmium liu et al 2015 tl stress increased the accumulation of ros in p kessleri r 3 therefore the effect of no donor and scavenger on ros levels in algal cells under tl stress was also measured as shown in fig 5b when snp was added under tl stress it significantly inhibited the production of ros in algal cells this indicated that an increase in no levels in algal cells eliminated a certain extent of ros produced by tl stress in algal cells a similar result was observed in plants where no donors and peroxynitrite reduced the accumulation of ros chu puga et al 2019 oxidative damage to plants by cd can also be mitigated by no which directly scavenges cd induced overload of ros instead of passing through the antioxidant enzyme system meng et al 2022 song et al suggested that a correlation between no and ros levels and the no level increased with decreasing ros levels song et al 2019 other studies have also reported the ability of no to counteract ros produced under heavy metal stress by scavenging or stimulating antioxidant defense systems in plants and microalgae imran et al 2022 on the other hand after tl treatment the intracellular gsh content of p kessleri r 3 under snp or c ptio was also measured fig 5c the gsh content of p kessleri r 3 significantly increased in the tl and snp combined with tl treatment groups the gsh content reached 430 22 nmol g 1 fresh alga snp may alleviate tl stress induced oxidative damage by enhancing gsh levels metabolite accumulation and antioxidant metabolism in addition in the tl combined with c ptio group the gsh content 203 44 nmol g 1 fresh alga was significantly reduced compared with that in the snp combined with tl treatment group this finding was in contrast to the ros level these results showed that the gsh content participated in regulating the oxidative stress of microalgae in response to tl stress snp was demonstrated to increase the production of gsh in maize seedlings sun et al 2022 gsh is one of the most essential antioxidants in microalgae and has the function of scavenging free radicals and buffering oxidative stress seo et al 2019 no can reduce oxidative stress by modulating the antioxidant defense process which may be achieved by inducing the enzymes and antioxidants involved in the antioxidant defense tewari et al 2021 exogenous addition of no increased the antioxidant capacity and gsh content in the roots of medicago truncatula seedlings under cd2 stress xu et al 2009 microalgae have attracted a great deal of interest because they are a potential source of biodiesel under controlled culture conditions there are many strategies to promote the production of microalgal lipids one of which is to increase the production of microalgal lipids by increasing stress regulated biochemical pathways the effect of tl stress on increasing the lipid synthesis of microalgae was also measured the results showed that no also played an essential role in regulating lipid accumulation in microalgae based on the above results and analysis a possible mechanism by which no regulates ros signaling to promote lipid accumulation and enhance antioxidant capacity under tl stress in microalgae is summarized in fig 6 microalgae tend to produce high levels of ros under tl stress conditions which can lead to oxidative damage to algal cells a range of micro algae defense mechanisms may be triggered to reduce the damage by tl to cells such as activation of the antioxidant system and accumulation of metabolites the addition of exogenous no can protect algal cells by modulating the response of microalgae to tl stress by increasing small molecules of antioxidants such as glutathione in algal cells which can inhibit the excess ros generated due to tl stress in addition ros may cause alterations in intracellular redox status and exogenous no may be involved in mediating ros signaling and promoting the expression of various transcription factors in algal cells through signal transduction and other pathways regulating genes related to lipid synthesis and resulting in the accumulation of lipids in microalgae it can be concluded that exogenous no may increase the resistance of microalgae to tl stress by regulating the lipogenesis and antioxidant capacity of microalgae through modulating the ros signaling pathway 3 5 fatty acid components of microalgae in response to tl stress the microalgae fatty acid compositions have a direct impact on the quality of biodiesel the carbon chain lengths of the fatty acids in the lipids of microalgae in the control and tl treatment groups were mainly between c16 c18 which were consistent with the requirements of biodiesel production table 2 maltsev and maltseva 2021 the saturated fatty acids sfas content of 10 23 under tl stress condition was slightly higher than that under control condition 7 05 on the other hand polyunsaturated fatty acids pufas mainly c18 3 under tl stress 78 53 were lower in content than under control condition 82 78 however the fatty acids content of the control group exhibited no significant difference from that of the tl treatment groups the degree of unsaturation du iodine value iv and cold filter plugging point cfpp are crucial evaluation indicators to examine whether lipids can be used as biodiesel feedstock gangadhar et al 2015 song et al 2023b the iv value is an important indicator of the oxidation trend of biodiesel and is closely related to the number and position of double bonds of unsaturated fatty acids the greater the degree of unsaturation of fatty acids the higher the iv value moreover regarding the du value the european standard does not exceed 137 as can be seen from the table 2 the du of both the control and tl treatment groups were not higher than 137 in line with the european standard zhao et al 2019b in addition the cfpp value is an important index to measure the low temperature performance of biodiesel the lower the cfpp value is the better the low temperature fluidity of biodiesel the cfpp values of the control and tl treatment group were 15 18 and 15 99 c respectively which were similar to the relevant standards in china bibi et al 2022 these results suggested that tl stress did not affect the fatty acid profiles 4 conclusions this study investigated the role of tl in the algal growth and lipid accumulation which can effectively promote lipid production through signal transduction in algal cells however low concentrations of tl less than 5 μg l 1 had little effect on the growth of microalgae and high concentrations of tl more than 5 μg l 1 inhibited the growth of microalgae tl can be efficiently removed and the tl removal efficiency reached 100 at tl concentrations of 1 25 μg l 1 further results demonstrated that exogenous addition of the no donor snp could enhance the tolerance to tl stress by mediating ros signaling participated in signal transduction and thus modulating lipid metabolism and antioxidant defense which led to greater accumulation of lipids 59 99 and gsh 430 22 nmol g 1 fresh alga these results indicated that no played a crucial role in reducing tl induced oxidative stress by activating the antioxidant defense system and lipid synthesis this study provides a novel insight on the use of microalgae for tl removal and biodiesel production and suggests a molecular mechanism for the regulation of no and ros signaling in the regulation of microalgae lipid accumulation under tl stress moreover batch experiments were used in this study to remove tl and further studies can be conducted to explore the removal of tl by microalgae using continuous or scaled up experiments which can contribute to the practical application of microalgae for heavy metal removal credit authorship contribution statement xueting

14756,thallium tl is a trace metal with extreme toxicity and is highly soluble in water posing a great risk to ecological and human safety this work aimed to investigate the role played by tl in regulating lipid accumulation in microalgae and the removal efficiency of tl the effect of tl on the cell growth lipid production and tl removal efficiency of parachlorella kessleri r 3 was studied low concentrations of tl had no significant effect on the biomass of microalgae when the tl concentration exceeded 5 μg l 1 the biomass of microalgae showed significant decrease the highest lipid content of 63 65 and lipid productivity of 334 55 mg l 1 d 1 were obtained in microalgae treated with 10 and 5 μg l 1 tl respectively microalgae can efficiently remove tl and the tl removal efficiency can reach 100 at tl concentrations of 0 25 μg l 1 the maximum nitric oxide no level of 470 48 fluorescence intensity 1 106 cells 1 and glutathione gsh content of 343 51 nmol g 1 fresh alga were obtained under 5 μg l 1 tl stress conditions furthermore the exogenous donor sodium nitroprusside snp supplemented with no was induced in microalgae to obtain a high lipid content 59 99 lipid productivity 397 99 mg l 1 d 1 and gsh content 430 22 nmol g 1 fresh alga the corresponding analysis results indicated that no could participate in the signal transduction pathway through modulation of reactive oxygen species ros signaling to activate the antioxidant system by increasing the gsh content to eliminate oxidative damage induced by tl stress in addition no regulation of ros signaling may enhance transcription factors associated with lipid synthesis which stimulates the expression of genes related to lipid synthesis leading to increased lipid biosynthesis in microalgae moreover it was found that the change in tl had little effect on the fatty acid components and biodiesel properties this study showed that tl stress can promote lipid accumulation in microalgae for biodiesel production and simultaneously effectively remove tl which provided evidence that no was involved in signal transduction and antioxidant defense and improved the understanding of the interrelation between no and ros to regulate lipid accumulation in microalgae graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords thallium biodiesel nitric oxide heavy metal parachlorella kessleri r 3 biological treatment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction thallium tl is a highly toxic heavy metal that is commonly distributed in nature and can seriously pollute the water environment thallium is present in approximately one third of the world with most countries in asia having thallium pollution problems and as many as 160 thallium containing minerals have been identified including thallium oxides thallium compounds and thallium containing minerals li et al 2020b rajendran et al 2022 thallium can cause damage to human health even at very low concentrations there have been several deaths in some countries due to malignant diseases caused by thallium containing water contamination as thallium is harmful to humans and highly hydrophilic it is easily absorbed by the skin and causes toxic dermatitis which can lead to death if left untreated li et al 2020a rajendran et al 2022 thallium in nature mainly has a 1 valence or 3 valence but tl3 has strong oxidation and is easily reduced to tl li et al 2020a moreover tl is mainly present as tl in most water and wastewater indicating that the treatment difficulty in water wastewater containing tl is the removal of tl tl is soluble in water and extremely difficult to eliminate in the human body which poses a serious risk to human health and the ecological environment birungi and chirwa 2017 the main techniques used for tl removal are adsorption ion exchange oxidation reduction precipitation and solvent extraction among which adsorption is of great interest due to its simplicity li et al 2020a xu et al 2019 the removal of tl from wastewater using sulfate reducing bacteria embedded in a polyvinyl alcohol alginate matrix as a biosorbent was investigated by zhang et al 2017 liu et al suggested that mnfe2o4 biochar composites show highly efficient removal of tl from wastewater liu et al 2021 in addition lópez et al stated that a magnetic composite of a prussian blue derivative and magnetite nanoparticles possesses a good adsorption capacity for tl lópez et al 2021 as mentioned above studies on tl removal from water wastewater through adsorption have focused on the use of bacteria and composite materials and there are few studies on the removal of tl using microalgae previous studies have shown the use of microalgae as a sustainable biosorbent to remove heavy metals hms as microalgae have a good ability to remove hms and improve the quality of water bodies cheng et al 2021 ubando et al 2021 zhao et al 2019a microalgae have been increasingly used in the treatment of hm polluted wastewater due to their culturability abundance of resources and fast growth rate kong et al 2022 liu et al 2023 on the other hand compared to higher plants microalgae are highly capable of nitrogen fixation and have a high tolerance to salt and alkali as well as a high photosynthetic efficiency which makes it possible to cultivate them in large quantities for wastewater treatment or other applications budamagunta et al 2023 ren et al 2015 shi et al 2023 zhao et al 2022b kafil et al assessed the removal capacity of cr vi and metabolite production by scenedesmus quadricauda under autotrophy and heterotrophy cultivation systems for synthetic wastewater treatment kafil et al 2022 tripathi and poluri also provided a comprehensive appreciation of the mechanism by which microalgae eliminated oxidative stress and detoxified hms at the transcriptome level tripathi and poluri 2021 the use of microalgae to remove hms from water bodies not only solves the pollution problem but also allows for the accumulated microalgae biomass to be used as potential feedstock for biofuel production singh and mishra 2022 yu et al 2023 microalgae tend to produce more lipids under hms stress conditions song et al 2022b zhao et al 2019a when microalgae are subjected to hms stress the physiological changes are manifested as a large accumulation of reactive oxygen species ros the moderate amount of ros accumulation induced by hms stress may be involved in regulating carbon partitioning and autophagy thereby promoting the lipid accumulation in microalgae zhang et al 2020 in addition hms indirectly trigger oxidative stress by interfering with the production and scavenging of ros in microalgae on the other hand microalgae can also develop corresponding defense mechanisms by synthesizing antioxidant enzymes and antioxidants to scavenge ros induced by hms stress and promote their defense against oxidative damage shao et al 2022 it was demonstrated that some signaling molecules in microalgae are also involved in algal growth lipid production and defense mechanisms under hms stress nitric oxide no is a gaseous small molecule radical and bio signaling molecule for many physiologically active substances and has a variety of biological activities in plants and microalgae li et al 2021 no regulates the growth metabolism and antioxidant systems of microalgae cells to maintain the stability of the intracellular environment domingos et al 2015 correspondingly no is able to upregulate genes of enzymes involved in proline and glutathione biosynthesis so it is suggested that no can medicate the intracellular antioxidant system in plants xu et al 2009 furthermore no is a novel bio signaling molecule that is lipid soluble which can propagate in cells and trigger signaling pathways that lead to the induction of the expression of related resistance genes and regulate defense responses in plants or microalgae through posttranslational altering proteins or through interactions with other signaling molecules meng et al 2022 sami et al 2018 in addition no is participated in the plant response to abiotic stress by promoting dry matter accumulation and reducing lipid peroxidation to reduce salt stress damage to rice thus maintaining ion homeostasis yan et al 2020 thus no plays an essential role in enhancing antioxidant capacity and signal transduction previous studies have also shown that no is an important intermediate part of the marine nitrogen cycle li et al 2021 it is worth noting that hms can be adsorbed by microalgae while hms can stimulate algal cells to produce stress and thereby modulate signal transduction pathways to produce more lipids for biodiesel production zhao et al 2019a however the mechanism by which tl stress regulates the lipid content and intracellular no accumulation in algal cells remains unknown the roles of no signaling and the relationship between no and ros in algal growth lipid production and the antioxidative defense system of microalgae under tl stress also need to be further investigated further elucidation is also needed on the removal of tl by microalgae therefore the effects of tl on the biomass concentration lipid content chemical components pigments carbohydrates and proteins and tl removal efficiency of microalgae were investigated in this study additionally the variations in ros and no signaling in microalgae under tl stress were elucidated furthermore the no donor and scavenger were investigated to determine the role of no signaling on algal growth lipid synthesis and antioxidative defense the association of no and ros signaling in microalgae in response to tl stress was also studied this study provides a novel strategy for lipid accumulation and offers insight into the interrelation between no and ros signaling mediated lipid biosynthesis and tl tolerance in microalgae 2 material and methods 2 1 microalgae and culture conditions the green algae parachlorella kessleri r 3 used in this work was isolated and purified from soil in harbin china as previously reported song et al 2022a algal cells were cultured for 9 days in 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks containing 150 ml bg 11 medium at 25 1 c 150 rpm min 1 and 3500 lx illumination intensity with a 12 h 12 h light dark cycle different concentrations of tl 0 1 5 10 15 and 25 μg l 1 sigma aldrich usa were added to the culture medium glucose 10 g l 1 was used as the only carbon source in the culture medium the initial ph of the culture medium was 6 8 7 0 ren et al 2022 to determine whether no was able to medicate the cell growth and lipid production of p kessleri r 3 to tl stress the nitric oxide donor sodium nitroprusside snp at 100 μm and nitric oxide scavenger carboxy potassium salt c ptio at 5 μm in the presence of 5 μg l 1 tl were used snp and c ptio were purchased from beyotime biotechnology shanghai china 2 2 algal growth and lipid analysis to determine the biomass concentration fresh algal cells were harvested through centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 5 min and washed 2 3 times with distilled water ren et al 2023 the collected algal cells were frozen overnight at 80 c and transferred to a vacuum freeze dryer for 24 h to constant weight the biomass concentration was the final dry weight divided by the algal liquid volume a chloroform methanol mixture 2 1 v v was used to extract the lipids of microalgae based on the modified method by zhao et al 2022c the lipid content and productivity were calculated according to a previous study song et al 2023a 2 3 determination of biochemical components ros level no level and gsh content the total pigment content of microalgae was measured by the methanol method using a previous method shin et al 2017 and detected at 470 652 and 665 nm using a uv spectrophotometer total carbohydrates and proteins of microalgae were extracted using an ultrasound cell crusher at 200 w for 10 min and determined by the phenol sulfuric acid method with glucose as the standard and by the bicinchoninic acid quantification assay kit beyotime biotechnology china with bsa as the standard respectively the ros level of microalgae was detected by 2 7 dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate dcfh da beyotime biotechnology china with an excitation wavelength ex of 488 nm and an emission wavelength em of 525 nm according to song et al 2020 the intracellular no level in the algal cells was measured using 3 amino 4 aminomethyl 2 7 difluorescein diacetate daf fm da beyotime biotechnology china daf fm da can cross cell membranes and can be catalyzed by intracellular esterase to form daf fm which cannot cross cell membranes daf fm itself is only weakly fluorescent and can fluoresce strongly when reacted with nitric oxide with an ex of 495 nm and an em of 515 nm the ros and no levels are shown as the fluorescence intensity per 1 106 cells the reduced glutathione gsh content was extracted and determined by a gsh assay kit suzhou keming biotechnology co ltd china and measured at 412 nm using a uv spectrophotometer by previously described zhao et al 2022a the gsh content is shown in μmol per g fresh alga 2 4 tl concentration and fourier transform infrared ftir analysis the determination of tl ion was carried out using an agilent 7700x instrument agilent usa to conduct inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms using a previous method hao et al 2022 the removal efficiency of tl ion t in the medium as measured by the absorption was calculated according to the following equation t c0 c 100 c0 where c0 and c represent the initial and final tl concentrations of the culture medium respectively for ftir spectroscopy analysis fresh algae cultured for 9 days were centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 5 min the harvested algal cells were washed three times with distilled water and dried the chemical components of the dried algal cells were analyzed by the potassium bromide kbr pellet method using fourier transform infrared spectromet ftir perkinelmer frontier in the mid infrared range 4000 400 cm 1 abinandan et al 2019 2 5 fatty acid methyl ester analysis for transesterification of extracted algal lipids into fatty acid methyl esters fames 2 ml of methanol and sulfuric acid mixture 97 3 v v were added and then incubated at 70 c for 4 h after cooling 2 ml n hexane was added and then extracted on a shaker at 150 rpm for 4 h the organic phase supernatant liquid was filtered using a 0 22 μm syringe filtration membrane for injection the fames were analyzed by a gas chromatography gc 7890a agilent usa equipped with an fid with a 37 component mix of fames as the standard song et al 2019 2 6 statistical analysis all experiments were conducted in triplicate and variability is shown as averages and sd the experimental graphs were plotted using origin 2023b the quantitative and statistical analysis of the experimental data was conducted using microsoft excel 2016 and one way anova by ibm spss ver 25 respectively significant differences were considered at p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of tl exposure on cell growth and lipid biosynthesis of microalgae the algal growth and lipid synthesis cultured with increasing concentrations of tl 0 to 25 μg l 1 are shown in fig 1 as shown in fig 1a adding 1 μg l 1 tl to microalgae cultivation resulted in a biomass concentration of 6 15 g l 1 this indicated that algal cell growth remained stable at low concentrations of tl and the obtained biomass concentration was comparable to that of 0 μg l 1 tl control 6 58 g l 1 at higher tl concentration 5 μg l 1 cell growth showed a negative trend and biomass concentration of 5 67 g l 1 was obtained higher concentrations of tl from 10 to 25 μg l 1 inhibited algal growth which significantly decreased the algal biomass concentration from 69 68 to 82 82 compared with the control fig 1a this observation was consistent with previous results showing that the growth rate of scenedesmus quadricauda decreased when the cr vi concentration increased from 5 to 10 ppm kafil et al 2022 furthermore the change in biomass productivity was similar to that in biomass concentration fig 1b this may be related to the excess ros production in algal cells with increasing tl concentration which results in algal cell death and thus a decrease in biomass it is well known that microalgae are capable of producing ros under stressful environments which can cause oxidative damage to algal cells in particular excessive ros is produced by microalgae under heavy metal stress conditions and in turn inhibit their growth song et al 2022a as the cd2 concentration increased from 100 to 250 μm the growth rate of chlorella sorokiniana was significantly inhibited leon vaz et al 2021 zhao et al 2019a showed that an increase in cd2 concentration from 20 to 80 μm had a negative effect on the cell growth rate which resulted in a lower biomass density of microalgae monoraphidium sp qly 1 furthermore the lipid content increased under tl stress 1 to 10 μg l 1 fig 1a the highest lipid content reached 63 65 in microalgae culture supplemented with 10 μg l 1 tl tl had a positive effect on algal lipid accumulation showing that appropriate oxidative stress of tl could promote high lipid production in the culture medium the lipid productivity of microalgae reached a maximum in the 5 μg l 1 tl treatment and the highest lipid productivity was 334 55 mg l 1 d 1 which was 1 13 fold higher than that of the control group fig 1b overall a certain concentration of tl stress can promote the lipid accumulation in microalgae the results showed that cr vi stress could induce lipid production in parachlorella kessleri r 3 song et al 2022b algae generally tend to decrease cell growth under stress conditions and algal cell metabolism shifts toward lipid synthesis and accumulation nanda et al 2021 zhao et al reported that lipid synthesis in monoraphidium sp increased at 40 μm cd2 compared to the control zhao et al 2019a the removal efficiencies under different concentrations of tl were also evaluated table s1 the microalgae p kessleri r 3 was able to remove 100 of tl from 1 to 25 μg l 1 after nine days of culture these findings indicated that p kessleri r 3 was a potential biosorbent for the removal of tl considering the biomass lipid productivity and tl removal efficiency 5 μg l 1 tl was chosen as the stress concentration for subsequent study the biomass concentration lipid content and tl removal efficiency of microalgae under the optimal tl concentration of 5 μg l 1 was monitored throughout the culture phase fig 2 as illustrated in fig 2a an increase in culture time positively affected algal growth leading to the highest biomass concentration on the ninth day the highest microalgae biomass concentration of 6 02 g l 1 was achieved in the control group furthermore a microalgae biomass concentration of 5 97 g l 1 was observed in the presence of 5 μg l 1 tl which was slightly less than that of the control this showed that p kessleri r 3 had good tolerance to tl in addition to biomass concentration the lipid content of microalgae was also measured to assess the algal response to tl at 5 μg l 1 as presented in fig 2b the lipid content of the control group and tl treatment group increased first in the early stage of culture the highest lipid content 67 02 was obtained in the presence of 5 μg l 1 tl on day 3 which was 1 13 times higher than that of the control furthermore the lipid content of microalgae in the presence of 5 μg l 1 tl slightly decreased and then became stable at the end of cultivation fig 2b microalgae tend to accumulate more lipids because this can protect themselves from stress damage song et al 2022a thus tl treatment could promote lipid production in microalgae the positive effect of lipid synthesis under heavy metal stress has been previously demonstrated zhao et al studied microalgae exposed to cd2 20 80 μm and obtained lipid contents of 47 07 52 78 zhao et al 2019a under 0 5 mg l 1 cr vi treatment lipid accumulation in the oleaginous microalga chlorella sp significantly increased and the highest lipid content of 54 17 was achieved liu et al 2017 the potential of algae to withstand environmental stresses and adapt to stressful conditions has been confirmed by some previous studies ali et al 2020 ji et al 2018 although the initial concentration of tl in the culture medium was relatively low this dose may pose a threat to human health if exposed to water bodies to identify the tl removed by microalgae tl removal efficiency was measured during the culture period fig 2c the removal efficiency of tl on day 3 was 56 07 further increasing the culture time up to day 9 the removal efficiency of tl reached 100 during the culture period culture time affected the removal of tl with increasing culture time 100 removal of tl can be achieved the improvement of tl removal efficiency may be due to some chemical groups such as oh and coo on the surface of algal cells chai et al 2021 pradhan et al 2019 ftir is an infrared spectroscopic technique of absorption emission or photoconduction over a broad spectral range and its spectra can reveal the vibrational patterns of atomic bonds and thus the main chemical groups of molecules cui and kerekes 2018 gu et al 2014 li et al 2022 the functional groups of organic compounds have been identified using ftir and the structural alterations of chemicals in algal cells have been predicted abinandan et al 2019 ftir spectra of microalgae under tl stress is shown in fig 2d the peak in the region 2925 cm 1 corresponded to the asymmetric elongation vibrations of ch containing aliphatic ch2 and ch3 groups indicating the characteristic peaks of carbohydrates and lipids the peaks in the 1650 cm 1 and 1550 cm 1 regions were attributed to the superposition of the c o typical stretching vibrations of the amide i band and the ch and cn stretching vibrations of the amide ii band associated with the protein 1200 900 cm 1 is associated with the vibrational stretching of coh and ch and the characteristic peaks of polysaccharides shou et al 2018 the intensity of the peak is closely related to the concentration of functional groups in the sample and reflects the relative concentration of functional groups although the position of the characteristic peaks of the functional groups was almost unchanged under tl stress the intensity of some spectral peaks increased after tl stress such as c o ch and cn the increase in the concentrations of these electronegative functional groups can make algal cells more easily combine with heavy metal ions thus efficiently removing tl li et al 2020c 3 2 effect of tl exposure on the chemical components of microalgae the changes in the chemical components pigments proteins and carbohydrates exposed to tl stress were also essential indicators for assessing the state of algal cells the pigment content chlorophyll a chlorophyll b and carotenoid of p kessleri r 3 cultivated in the tl containing culture medium was investigated throughout the cultivation phase the chlorophyll a content of microalgae cultured in the presence of 5 μg l 1 tl increased slightly with cultivation time fig 3 a the highest chlorophyll a content in the control and 5 μg l 1 tl treatment groups reached 27 01 and 27 39 mg l 1 on day 9 respectively there was no significant difference comparing the control group with the tl treatment group p 0 05 and the changes in chlorophyll a content were consistent with the growth of microalgae chlorophyll a has been shown to be closely associated with growth in microalgae ji et al 2018 zhao et al also assessed the growth of microalgae by measuring chlorophyll a in monoraphidium sp zhao et al 2019a the chlorophyll b content under tl treatment was comparable to that of control group throughout the cultivation phase fig 3a on the other hand the carotenoid content in the control group and tl treatment group showed a trend of first increasing and then decreasing with minor differences a much higher carotenoid content of 4 98 mg l 1 was obtained on day 5 for the tl treatment group carotenoids play different roles in the metabolism and growth of plants or microalgae first as auxiliary pigments in photosynthetic photosynthesis and as precursors for the synthesis of signaling molecules such as abscisic acid and β cyclocitral thus playing an important role in the cell growth and stress response of plants or microalgae felemban et al 2019 kromdijk et al 2016 however the mechanisms underlying the changes in carotenoid content under tl stress still need to be further investigated apart from synthesizing lipids microalgae can also produce other high value biomacromolecules such as proteins and carbohydrates the protein content under tl treatment significantly decreased from 25 01 to 7 66 during the first three days of cultivation fig 3b in addition exposure to tl stress significantly decreased the carbohydrate content at the initial cultivation and then the carbohydrate content slightly decreased at the later stage of cultivation fig 3c in previous reports the protein and carbohydrate contents under abiotic stress conditions in monoraphidium sp sharply decreased at the initial culture phase li et al 2017 zhao et al recorded that the carbohydrate content decreased significantly from 18 68 to 10 79 on the first day of induction which was accompanied by a rapid accumulation of lipids zhao et al 2019a the protein and carbohydrate contents in microalgae are closely related to carbon flow and tl stress could regulate carbon reallocation which might be used to biosynthesize more lipids qiao et al 2022 3 3 effect of tl exposure on no ros levels and gsh content of microalgae no and ros have been considered as important signaling molecules in algal cells particularly under adverse conditions and are involved in signal transduction pathways regulating the defense response of algal cells under stressful conditions signorelli et al 2019 therefore the intracellular no and ros levels of p kessleri r 3 under tl stress conditions and in the control were assessed fig 4 a and 4b the no level gradually increased with increasing culture time under tl stress reaching the highest fluorescence intensity of 470 48 fluorescence intensity 1 106 cells 1 on the fifth day and then gradually began to decrease over time fig 4a in addition the no level under tl treatment was significantly higher than that under the control which may be due to the stimulatory effect of stress this may be related to the involvement of no in the response to tl stress similar results were also found in rice where endogenous no levels were increased under salt stress conditions yan et al 2020 ding et al showed that the no level of haematococcus pluvialis increased upon exposure to high light conditions ding et al 2018 an increase in the no level has also been suggested to enhance the algal defense response under abiotic stress conditions by activating the antioxidant system in algal cells through signal transduction song et al 2019 microalgae tend to produce a certain level of ros under stress conditions fig 4b shows that the ros level increased during the pre mid culture phase in algal cells under tl stress and then showed significant decrease p 0 05 the highest ros level of 344 38 fluorescence intensity 1 106 cells 1 was observed on day 7 which was significantly higher than the control 144 64 fluorescence intensity 1 106 cells 1 fig 4b a certain level of ros production may be associated with the rapid accumulation of lipids ros is central to multiple signaling networks in algal cells and play a dual role in lipid production mediating cellular stress responses and enhancing lipid accumulation zhang et al 2020 ros have been demonstrated by wang et al to mediate the transition from carbohydrate storage to lipid synthesis in chlorella protothecoides through signaling networks wang et al 2016 the content of gsh in algal cells was also investigated which was involved in the cellular response to tl stress along with the increase in ros levels under stress conditions the gsh content exhibited a corresponding increase the gsh content in p kessleri r 3 with 5 μg l 1 tl treatment was significantly increased and the highest gsh content was 343 51 nmol g 1 fresh alga on day 3 fig 4c the increase in gsh content was beneficial to the antioxidant defense system of algal cells as an important regulatory substance in algal cells gsh has antioxidant and integrative detoxification effects which guarantee the normal function of proteins and enzymes to protect algal cells from ros damage zhang et al 2020 qiao et al also found an increase in gsh content in microalgae to eliminate ros production due to salinity stress qiao et al 2021 as a precursor of phytochelatin no can promote the increase in gsh content in medicago truncatula roots by enhancing the high expression of gamma glutamylcysteine synthetase γ ecs and glutathione synthetase gsh genes and improve its resistance to heavy metal stress innocenti et al 2007 3 4 no modulated algal growth lipid accumulation no level and gsh content by regulating ros signaling in the presence of tl to further understand the relationship between intracellular no level and ros in the induction of lipid accumulation in response to tl stress the effects of no biosynthesis donor snp and scavenger c ptio on algal growth lipid production no ros level and gsh content on day 9 were investigated when snp was added to the tl treatment group the biomass concentration and productivity 5 91 g l 1 and 645 56 mg l 1 d 1 of microalgae were comparable to those in the tl treatment group alone 5 90 g l 1 and 644 86 mg l 1 d 1 moreover when c ptio was added to the tl treatment group the cell growth of microalgae was significantly inhibited and the biomass concentration productivity reached 3 85 g l 1 416 94 mg l 1 d 1 table 1 this may be because the addition of no donors cannot directly participate in the regulation of microalgae growth but the removal of no directly affects algal growth gupta et al 2022 similar snp may be involved in co2 assimilation which in turn affects the cell growth and development li et al 2021 further investigation is needed on the role of snp in the regulation of algal growth snp combined with tl stress had significant impact on the lipid accumulation of p kessleri r 3 correspondingly the highest lipid content productivity of 59 99 397 99 mg l 1 d 1 with snp combined with tl stress was achieved which was higher than that of the tl stress group 50 81 333 12 mg l 1 d 1 however lipid synthesis was significantly decreased in the c ptio combined with tl stress group the results of algal growth and lipid synthesis indicated that no was an essential signaling molecule which in turn affected the lipid accumulation of p kessleri r 3 under tl stress the addition of snp and c ptio to the tl group is necessary for the detection and analysis of intracellular no levels as shown in fig 5 a the no level of the snp combined with tl stress group was significantly higher than those of the other treatment groups the no level was 1 71 1 50 2 00 and 1 53 times that of the control tl stress tl combined with c ptio and tl combined with snp and c ptio groups respectively to confirm the stimulatory effect of snp treatment as a result of no production the no scavenger c ptio was applied together with snp fig 5a the results suggested that snp can significantly increase no levels while c ptio was effective in removing no from algal cells according to liu et al snp treatment also raised the no level in trifolium repens l as well as their antioxidant content and antioxidant enzyme activity which reduced the toxicity of cadmium liu et al 2015 tl stress increased the accumulation of ros in p kessleri r 3 therefore the effect of no donor and scavenger on ros levels in algal cells under tl stress was also measured as shown in fig 5b when snp was added under tl stress it significantly inhibited the production of ros in algal cells this indicated that an increase in no levels in algal cells eliminated a certain extent of ros produced by tl stress in algal cells a similar result was observed in plants where no donors and peroxynitrite reduced the accumulation of ros chu puga et al 2019 oxidative damage to plants by cd can also be mitigated by no which directly scavenges cd induced overload of ros instead of passing through the antioxidant enzyme system meng et al 2022 song et al suggested that a correlation between no and ros levels and the no level increased with decreasing ros levels song et al 2019 other studies have also reported the ability of no to counteract ros produced under heavy metal stress by scavenging or stimulating antioxidant defense systems in plants and microalgae imran et al 2022 on the other hand after tl treatment the intracellular gsh content of p kessleri r 3 under snp or c ptio was also measured fig 5c the gsh content of p kessleri r 3 significantly increased in the tl and snp combined with tl treatment groups the gsh content reached 430 22 nmol g 1 fresh alga snp may alleviate tl stress induced oxidative damage by enhancing gsh levels metabolite accumulation and antioxidant metabolism in addition in the tl combined with c ptio group the gsh content 203 44 nmol g 1 fresh alga was significantly reduced compared with that in the snp combined with tl treatment group this finding was in contrast to the ros level these results showed that the gsh content participated in regulating the oxidative stress of microalgae in response to tl stress snp was demonstrated to increase the production of gsh in maize seedlings sun et al 2022 gsh is one of the most essential antioxidants in microalgae and has the function of scavenging free radicals and buffering oxidative stress seo et al 2019 no can reduce oxidative stress by modulating the antioxidant defense process which may be achieved by inducing the enzymes and antioxidants involved in the antioxidant defense tewari et al 2021 exogenous addition of no increased the antioxidant capacity and gsh content in the roots of medicago truncatula seedlings under cd2 stress xu et al 2009 microalgae have attracted a great deal of interest because they are a potential source of biodiesel under controlled culture conditions there are many strategies to promote the production of microalgal lipids one of which is to increase the production of microalgal lipids by increasing stress regulated biochemical pathways the effect of tl stress on increasing the lipid synthesis of microalgae was also measured the results showed that no also played an essential role in regulating lipid accumulation in microalgae based on the above results and analysis a possible mechanism by which no regulates ros signaling to promote lipid accumulation and enhance antioxidant capacity under tl stress in microalgae is summarized in fig 6 microalgae tend to produce high levels of ros under tl stress conditions which can lead to oxidative damage to algal cells a range of micro algae defense mechanisms may be triggered to reduce the damage by tl to cells such as activation of the antioxidant system and accumulation of metabolites the addition of exogenous no can protect algal cells by modulating the response of microalgae to tl stress by increasing small molecules of antioxidants such as glutathione in algal cells which can inhibit the excess ros generated due to tl stress in addition ros may cause alterations in intracellular redox status and exogenous no may be involved in mediating ros signaling and promoting the expression of various transcription factors in algal cells through signal transduction and other pathways regulating genes related to lipid synthesis and resulting in the accumulation of lipids in microalgae it can be concluded that exogenous no may increase the resistance of microalgae to tl stress by regulating the lipogenesis and antioxidant capacity of microalgae through modulating the ros signaling pathway 3 5 fatty acid components of microalgae in response to tl stress the microalgae fatty acid compositions have a direct impact on the quality of biodiesel the carbon chain lengths of the fatty acids in the lipids of microalgae in the control and tl treatment groups were mainly between c16 c18 which were consistent with the requirements of biodiesel production table 2 maltsev and maltseva 2021 the saturated fatty acids sfas content of 10 23 under tl stress condition was slightly higher than that under control condition 7 05 on the other hand polyunsaturated fatty acids pufas mainly c18 3 under tl stress 78 53 were lower in content than under control condition 82 78 however the fatty acids content of the control group exhibited no significant difference from that of the tl treatment groups the degree of unsaturation du iodine value iv and cold filter plugging point cfpp are crucial evaluation indicators to examine whether lipids can be used as biodiesel feedstock gangadhar et al 2015 song et al 2023b the iv value is an important indicator of the oxidation trend of biodiesel and is closely related to the number and position of double bonds of unsaturated fatty acids the greater the degree of unsaturation of fatty acids the higher the iv value moreover regarding the du value the european standard does not exceed 137 as can be seen from the table 2 the du of both the control and tl treatment groups were not higher than 137 in line with the european standard zhao et al 2019b in addition the cfpp value is an important index to measure the low temperature performance of biodiesel the lower the cfpp value is the better the low temperature fluidity of biodiesel the cfpp values of the control and tl treatment group were 15 18 and 15 99 c respectively which were similar to the relevant standards in china bibi et al 2022 these results suggested that tl stress did not affect the fatty acid profiles 4 conclusions this study investigated the role of tl in the algal growth and lipid accumulation which can effectively promote lipid production through signal transduction in algal cells however low concentrations of tl less than 5 μg l 1 had little effect on the growth of microalgae and high concentrations of tl more than 5 μg l 1 inhibited the growth of microalgae tl can be efficiently removed and the tl removal efficiency reached 100 at tl concentrations of 1 25 μg l 1 further results demonstrated that exogenous addition of the no donor snp could enhance the tolerance to tl stress by mediating ros signaling participated in signal transduction and thus modulating lipid metabolism and antioxidant defense which led to greater accumulation of lipids 59 99 and gsh 430 22 nmol g 1 fresh alga these results indicated that no played a crucial role in reducing tl induced oxidative stress by activating the antioxidant defense system and lipid synthesis this study provides a novel insight on the use of microalgae for tl removal and biodiesel production and suggests a molecular mechanism for the regulation of no and ros signaling in the regulation of microalgae lipid accumulation under tl stress moreover batch experiments were used in this study to remove tl and further studies can be conducted to explore the removal of tl by microalgae using continuous or scaled up experiments which can contribute to the practical application of microalgae for heavy metal removal credit authorship contribution statement xueting

14757,direct and indirect threats by organic micropollutants can only be reliably assessed and prevented if the exposure to these chemicals is known which in turn requires a confident estimate of their emitted amounts into the environment apis active pharmaceutical ingredients enter surface waters mostly through the sewer system and wastewater treatment plants wwtps however their effluent fluxes are highly variable and influenced by several different factors that challenge robust emission estimates here we defined a dimensionless theoretically consumption independent escape factor kesc for estimating the amount of apis expected to be present in wwtp effluents the factor is determined as the proportion of marketed and actually emitted amounts of apis a large collection of german and swiss monitoring datasets were analyzed to calculate stochastic kesc values for 31 apis reflecting both the magnitude and uncertainty of consumption normalised emissions escape factors provide an easy to use tool for the estimation of average api emissions and expected variability from numerous wwtps given that consumption data are provided thereby supporting simulation modeling of the fate of apis in stream networks or exposure assessments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords micropollutants wastewater treatment plant surface water emission effluent large scale fate modeling data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction thousands of synthetic organic chemicals are emitted into the environment many of which are bioactive by design active pharmaceutical ingredients api undoubtedly belong to this category and therefore present a potential direct threat to exposed ecosystems brodin et al 2014 cunningham et al 2006 fent 2008 halling sørensen et al 1998 länge and dietrich 2002 petrie et al 2015 and indirectly to the humans relying on these ecosystems services e g cunningham et al 2010 emmanuel et al 2009 peng et al 2016 such threats can only be reliably assessed and prevented if the exposure to these chemicals is known which in turn requires a confident estimate of their emissions into the environment namely into the most important receiving bodies surface waters emissions to surface waters can be traced back to two principal human activities production and use of pharmaceuticals emissions may occur when a chemical is synthesised i e from production facilities through accidental leaks or through routine wastewater disposal if the applied treatment technology is not capable of removing the compound completely anliker et al 2022 2020a 2020b cardoso et al 2014 emara et al 2019 the contribution of this pathway to total emissions is estimated to be in the range of a mere few percents except for some developing countries with highly concentrated pharmaceutical industries caldwell 2016 on the more important consumer side there are two partially intertwined pathways incorporating a complex sequence of loss processes occurring from purchasing the chemical to actual emissions into surface waters delli compagni et al 2020 after purchase the two consumer pathways get separated the shorter unintended usage branch actually avoids human consumption and often involves direct disposal to sewage while the proper usage branch follows the sequence of consumption metabolism where applicable and excretion or other type of emission halling sørensen et al 1998 the two pathways rejoin in the sewer system from where apis travel to the communal wastewater treatment facilities and finally towards the point of emission of the treated sewage of these possible emission pathways for apis the proper usage pathway is usually the largest caldwell 2016 corresponding to a mostly rational behavior from both producers and consumers pharmaceutical consumption may have long term year to year variability that is influenced by the characteristics of the population the actual epidemiological situation and the change in medical technology van der aa et al 2011 consumption may be steady or seasonal in a year depending on the pathological feature targeted by the api drugs entering the human body undergo four main processes absorption distribution metabolism and excretion which are affected by several factors such as characteristics of the api dose of intake and health conditions caldwell et al 1995 hilmer et al 2007 after entering the sewer system apis may undergo various chemical and biological transformations in the sewer system particularly in the receiving wastewater treatment plants wwtps the latter may sometimes be circumvented and apis may enter surface waters without treatment in case of active combined sewer overflows launay et al 2016 to describe this series of processes in detail would require measurements after each phase yet the majority of relevant studies concentrate on removal processes inside the wwtp see e g kasprzyk hordern et al 2009 oberoi et al 2019 patrolecco et al 2015 wang et al 2020 whereas only few target sewer networks themselves gao et al 2017 jelic et al 2015 mccall et al 2016 o brien et al 2017 thai et al 2014 due to the difficulty of sampling and the high variability of sources and pollutant transport ort et al 2010a 2010b in the end this series of linked processes produces high spatial and temporal variability in effluent and surface water concentrations baker et al 2014 burns et al 2018 daneshvar et al 2010 vieno et al 2005 around the complex chain of transport and transformation processes between an api s synthesis and its entering the surface waters the most robust long term data available are commercial sales information for apis used in human medication such statistics have been collected regularly since many decades in regional and quarterly resolution at both product and api levels to monitor the effectiveness of pharmaceutical marketing to use this data source for estimating emissions from effluents of several wwtps a mapping method has to be found that bridges sales consumption to emissions to surface waters a related inverse method is routinely used in wastewater based epidemiology the so called correction factors are used to back calculate consumptions from measured loads of drugs see e g baker et al 2014 duan et al 2022 gracia lor et al 2016 van nuijs et al 2011 zuccato et al 2005 thai et al 2016 2019 reversed this definition and defined the correction factor as the ratio of daily consumption and daily load in wastewater that beside estimating consumption or excretion rates can also be used to calculate concentrations in the sewer network from consumption thai et al 2016 2019 yet these all exclude the wwtp itself which is the major source of pharmaceuticals to surface waters daughton and ternes 1999 in this study we apply a new lumped treatment to the series of processes between sales of 31 apis and the corresponding effluents of wwtps based on national sales data and effluent concentration measurements it was tested in the period of 2010 2019 at several wwtps from germany and switzerland whether consumption statistics can be used to estimate api emissions regionally i e for a multitude of wwtps at once we define a dimensionless escape factor kesc as the proportion of the marketed apis appearing in wwtp effluents with the objective to deliver a less case specific indicator of the transfer of marketed pharmaceuticals into surface waters which can then be used to estimate emissions over multiple wwtps some former studies used a somewhat similar approach to estimate wwtp effluent concentrations from annual national sales data alder et al 2010 ter laak et al 2010 however these studies were carried out on a narrower set of wwtps and compounds and focused on the conceptual description of involved factors such as metabolism and removal instead of trying to gather a wider body of empirical evidence alder et al 2010 ter laak et al 2010 by its definition kesc integrates all of the above mentioned processes in a single number that should theoretically be between 0 marketed api is not emitted to surface waters at all and 1 the entire marketed amount in the catchment reaches the rivers unless releases from production formation in the sewer system or in the wwtp or veterinary usage of an active ingredient are significant 2 materials and methods 2 1 the escape factor the lumped escape factor is defined simply as the ratio between the marketed amount of the api and the amount showing up in wwtp effluent 1 f eff k esc f cons n pop where feff is the flux in the effluent ng d 1 fcons is the mean per capita marketed daily dosage of the api ng d 1 and npop is the population connected to the wwtp the escape factor as defined by eq 1 fully describes the relationship between marketed amount and emissions for analytical purposes the escape factor can be decomposed into parts describing known transport and transformation mechanisms if the oral administration pathway is assumed to be dominating kesc can be decomposed into the following form 2 k e s c 1 k f l u s h k e x c k f l u s h 1 k r e m where kexc is the excreted fraction of the non metabolized api from the body dimensionless krem is the removal efficiency in the wastewater infrastructure i e the sewer network and the wwtp dimensionless and kflush is the fraction of the marketed amount entering the sewer system without ingestion dimensionless the improperly disposed down the drain fraction is more dependent on the targeted disease class and prescribed application method than the bio chemical properties of the api caldwell 2016 its parameter kflush can be roughly estimated for apis with known very low kexc and krem from eq 2 one could further extend eq 2 by adding factors representing e g separate transformation in the sewer system and in the wwtp deconjugation delli compagni et al 2020 loads from topical application kannan et al 2023 etc yet in the absence of relevant data from the targeted spatial scale this would not contribute to a better estmation of emissions for multiple wwtps in practice kesc can be estimated from marketing and effluent data by rearranging eq 1 3 k e s c c e f f q e f f f c o n s n p o p where ceff is the characteristic concentration of the api in the wwtp effluent ng l 1 depending on the time scale of the study and qeff is the corresponding discharge measurement l d 1 the task is to find the relevant values of fcons and npop that can be used in combination with existing measurements of ceff and qeff 2 2 apis and their sales we selected 31 widely used apis that often show up in surface waters of europe in significant quantities table 1 shows the relevant properties related to kesc calculations main fields and types of application usage in veterinary medicine and significant seasonal variability in consumption as the subjects of our analysis api sales data for the actual amount of active ingredients kg per year or quarter were obtained under license from country representatives of iqvia formerly ims health www iqvia com through the federal environmental agencies of the two countries umweltbundesamt for germany bundesamt für umwelt for switzerland sales data covered all application types oral other types of internal usage eye drops ear drops rectal suppositories etc intravenous and topical annual api sales for germany were available for the period of 2010 2018 iqvia midas annual sales data 2010 2018 whereas for switzerland between 2014 and 2016 iqvia national dataview sales apo sd spi with market segmentation data extracts 2014 2016 beside these datasets singer et al provided estimations for the german and the swiss sales for 2009 singer et al 2016 based on pharmaceutical sales data obtained from ims health midas annual sales data 2009 for the years of 2017 and 2018 iqvia also provided quarterly market data for germany beside the annual statistics iqvia midas quarterly sales data 2017 2018 all consumption data referred to human medical usage thus excluding other e g veterinary applications 2 3 wwtp data wwtp effluent data were obtained from four swiss and two german monitoring campaigns from the rhine and rhône catchments table 2 swiss data were provided by eawag swiss federal institute of aquatic science and technology and vsa verband schweizer abwasser und gewässerschutzfachleute association of swiss experts on wastewater and water protection german data were provided by the lubw landesanstalt für umwelt baden württemberg state environment institute baden württemberg and lanuv landesamt für natur umwelt und verbraucherschutz nordrhein westfalen state office for nature environment and consumer protection north rhine westphalia emitted fluxes were calculated as the product of sample concentrations with the corresponding discharge which may have been directly measured or estimated long term effluent discharge see remark column in table 2 additional information on the characteristics of measurement campaigns can be found in tables si4 and si5 in supporting information si the number of inhabitants actually connected to the wwtp npop is relevant to calculate kesc see eq 3 datasets of the two german de1 and de2 and one of the swiss campaigns ch4 contained information on the served population for the wwtps for the other swiss wwtps served population data were collected from two sources data from 2005 were gained from the database of maps of switzerland federal office of topography swisstopo 2018 as values characteristic for the initial years data for 2017 were collected from the webpage of the swiss federal agency for bafu das bundesamt für umwelt swiss federal agency for environment 2018 wherever it was possible actual served population values from the year of the sampling campaign were used in other cases we determined them by interpolating from other years or when data gaps were too frequent for interpolation by taking values from the closest available year 2 4 pairing consumption with effluent concentrations consumption data contained significant year to year and seasonal changes for numerous compounds long term trends reflect the dynamics of the market share of a specific api however consumption can also vary seasonally which may be significant for apis prescribed for seasonally appearing symptoms e g for allergy and flu to get a precise estimate of kesc it was important to match fcons to the period when effluent concentrations were measured as much as possible otherwise consumption dynamics would seriously bias kesc the fcons is equal to the mean quarterly consumption the annual marketed amount multiplied with a seasonality factor f q see in table si1 divided by the population of the given year both on country level the highest temporal resolution of consumption data was quarterly but this was limited to germany and only available for two years therefore we applied a multiplicative interpolation model of consumption dynamics that was used to estimate quarterly consumption from the annual data 4 c y q c y s c q 4 c y 1 c y f q where c y q is consumption kg quarter in the qth quarter of year y cy is the mean quarterly consumption of the given year y kg quarter cy 1 is the mean quarterly consumption in the next year and q is the quarter index 1 4 sc is the slope of the local subannual trend in year y kg year and f q is the seasonal multiplicator dimensionless with the mean of 1 over all quarters the consumption model in eq 4 was fitted for each compound four steps fig 1 1 first long term trends were fitted for switzerland and germany separately to estimate mean annual values cy for years with effluent concentration measurements but with no consumption data in other cases national sales data were used as cy as the swiss data for 2009 were given as semi closed intervals for some compounds by singer and coworkers singer et al 2016 this year was included in the calculations in two alternative ways depending on the type of estimation explicit values were directly used for the consumption in 2009 when ranges were provided e g consumption was higher than or equal to a given limit value the final value for 2009 was decided based on a linear trend analysis the linear regression value for 2009 was accepted when it fell into the range specified by singer et al 2016 otherwise the closer limit value of the interval was used based on the position of data gaps extrapolation or interpolation was used to fill in missing annual values between 2010 and 2019 2 after estimating the long term trends local subannual trends were calculated the mean annual consumptions cy for two adjacent years were taken as the consumption in the first quarters of the years between these two values a linear trend was set as the subannual change inside a year the slope of this subannual trend is sc and the mean annual consumptions were calculated for the other three quarters with always 3 months shifting 3 as the next step f q seasonality factors were determined for each compound based on the quarterly consumption data for germany 2017 2018 seasonal variability was assumed to be country independent thus f q determined from the german quarterly datasets was applied to all the other years both in the german and swiss consumption time series to determine seasonal variability of consumption within a year that is assumed to be nearly constant from year to year we eliminated the trend component from the quarterly consumption time series decomposition meant to separate the time series into trend and seasonality components a multiplicative model was used in decomposition detection of trend requires smoothing the time series using the centered moving average method render et al 2018 as quarterly summarized consumption data were available for 2 years and there were 4 data points per year moving average window of 4 was applied then f q could be determined from the ratio between the actual consumption and the trendline 4 quarterly consumptions were calculated for each year without quarterly sales data based on f q values mean annual consumptions cy were multiplied by the seasonality factors to actually pair consumption with effluent concentrations we used the following algorithm 1 if quarterly consumption data was available for a compound estimated consumption for the corresponding year and month of the effluent concentration measurements were used by applying eq 3 2 if quarterly consumption data was not available but annual was annual consumption from the corresponding year of the effluent concentration measurements was used 3 results 3 1 market trends and seasonality seasonal multiplicators f q were calculated for all compounds see in table si1 from the quarterly datasets of germany 2017 2018 cla fex and phe showed significant seasonal variability for all other apis seasonal changes were negligible cla is an antibiotic to cure bacterial infections related mainly to the respiratory system with highly increasing consumption in the first quarter of the year 50 and lower consumption in warmer months fex is mostly used to treat allergy symptoms accordingly it has a pronounced peak 52 in consumption in the second quarter of the year phe is a pain reliever and fever reducing drug it shows a moderate 10 increase in consumption in the first quarter of the year which can be explained by its use related to flu like illnesses typical during the colder seasons 3 2 escape factors escape factors were calculated separately from all six datasets see table si2 depending on data availability not all compounds had been measured in all datasets for all compounds mean kesc e kesc values and standard deviations sd kesc were estimated across the six datasets both country based de studies and ch studies columns in table 3 and completely pooled all studies column in table 3 statistics were produced by using weighted unique escape factors weights were determined based on the time interval represented by the samples with weight of grab samples set to 1 hour and composite samples set to the actual sampling interval again in hours table 3 when it was possible to calculate escape factors for the same compound in both countries the results could be compared as it can be expected from its consumption independent definition escape factors of a given substance should be very similar in switzerland and germany given that wastewater treatment technologies are similar too this assumption was better fulfilled in the first half of the period of analysis the development of wastewater treatment plants equipped with the fourth treatment stage multiplied after the corresponding regulations were accepted in 2016 for switzerland metz 2017 and in 2018 for germany bmu uba 2019 thus most of the effluent datasets used in this study are obtained from plants that have not yet been upgraded to the date of measurements in most of the cases national kesc estimates were indeed similar e g ami car cla lam mto sul ven still in a few cases major differences were detected in escape factors between the two countries e g ate bez gab hyd tri val moreover for certain compounds calculated escapes rate values were higher than 1 which would mean negative removal rates or excretion over 100 while such findings are to some extent related to uncertainty in sampling and analytical quantification they might also stem from non representative consumption data or formation of the api from conjugated metabolites in the wwtp formation of parent apis in wwtp was identified for some of the target compounds with occasional supporting literature evidence see e g verlicchi et al 2012 for car and tri sipma et al 2010 for dic and sul values greater than 3 were not included in the calculation of e kesc and sd kesc due to their high uncertainty for the ch4 dataset e kesc and sd kesc values were also calculated separately for all quarters of the year yet there was no significant change compared to annual values see table si3 thus it can be concluded that the effect of seasonally variable processes such as the removal rate of wwtps are negligible compared to the overall variability of escape factors observed for instance at the cantonal or country level 3 3 variability of emissions from wwtps

covered by data e g the effect of seasons wwtp size or the relative contribution of industrial sewage randomness can of course originate from the variability of factors contributing to kesc but the final level of uncertainty is modulated by their expected values too see section s4 in si removal rates of sewer systems and wwtps are strongly dependent on the physico chemical characteristics of the micropollutant the composition of wastewater the state of the system the treatment technology and they thus may vary in a wide range sewer systems gao et al 2017 jelic et al 2015 o brien et al 2017 thai et al 2014 wwtps cirja et al 2008 petrie et al 2015 sipma et al 2010 for some of the compounds in the high variability category highly variable wwtp removal rates are known too bez gab petrie et al 2015 ate sipma et al 2010 for the other compounds in the category we are not aware of relevant studies specifically there was no significant relation to wwtp size although we initially expected the smaller plants to work somewhat less efficiently than the large ones there appeared to be some weak connection between variability and the season of sampling in the swiss campaigns but the same did not show up in the german datasets and it turned out that the wwtp size classes in swiss campaigns were not evenly distributed seasonally i e the few large plants were sampled in the spring while smaller plants were sampled both in the spring and late summer where known the proportion of industrial sewage did not correlate with kesc thus the roles of krem and potential production related emissions could not be properly resolved given the available data 3 4 estimation of kflush values if kesc is decomposed along assumptions on the pathways between marketed amounts and emissions hypotheses can be tested on its components we use eq 2 to show such an application for estimating down the drain disposal of apis which can contribute to the emissions significantly kasprzyk hordern et al 2021 in eq 2 the portion of marketed apis that reach the sewer network without prior ingestion is accounted for as kflush the simplicity of eq 2 implies that compounds must fulfill several criteria that this decomposition remains meaningful i they are unable to conjugate deconjugate within the sewer system and wwtps ii human topical administration or veterinary usage is negligible and iii they have insignificant input from production facilities which may change with time anliker et al 2020a even under such strict conditions there are still three factors contributing to kesc so one cannot identify them from kesc alone to overcome this we selected compounds for which kexc is known to be negligible this condition eliminates the impact of the proper usage pathway from eq 2 four compounds with very low excretion rates were investigated for which urine is the main clearance pathway and excretion efficiency is known namely car with an excretion rate of unchanged parent compound in urine kexc 0 01 lienert et al 2007 mef with kexc 0 02 naseer et al 2007 moc with kexc 0 01 jauch et al 1990 and oxc with kexc 0 01 fda u s food and drug administration 2020 among these car is actually an outlier because it does not fulfill criterion i back formation has been observed by several studies e g vieno et al 2007 for the other compounds kesc is the direct conservative minimal estimate for kflush mef kesc mean 0 03 moc kesc mean 0 12 oxc kesc mean 0 15 using data from all studies because assuming that kesc kflush neglects removal in the sewer system and the wwtp for car the appropriateness of kesc in estimating kflush is uncertain further on wwtp removal rates are known to be negligible for moc and oxc so for them kesc is not only a minimal but a representative estimate for the proportion of improper usage pathway in contrast removal can be significant for mef tauxe wuersch et al 2005 50 kasprzyk hordern et al 2008 70 so kflush is expected to be 2 3 3 times greater than kesc 4 discussion 4 1 scope of apis in this paper a collection of relative emission estimations is presented for 31 widely used apis based on a broad monitoring dataset from several campaigns from two countries according to our best knowledge this is the so far largest analysis ever performed on estimating emissions from consumption data somewhat similar earlier studies concentrated on only a few compounds du et al 2020 gao et al 2021 thai et al 2016 2019 the demand for more reliable data on emissions and environmental behavior of chemicals is increasing due to interest in pec predicted environmental concentration values prioritization of compounds and developing risk mitigation strategies tong et al 2022 emissions are the backbone of exposure and in situ fate calculations marketed amounts of apis are often considered as the most robust reference points when wwtp in or effluent data are not available or not indicative for example when a high number of wwtps are involved in exposure assessment see oldenkamp et al 2018 and references cited therein therefore many regional exposure or fate models utilize parameters closely related to the here defined escape factor e g grill et al 2016 lindim et al 2016 oldenkamp et al 2018 as shown by the case specific escape factor values the transfer efficiency between market and actual emissions is highly variable therefore related parameters are optimal subjects for calibration however it is very difficult to identify emissions from in stream concentration or flux profiles along rivers as longitudinal flux profiles belonging to a wide range of first order degradation and emission rates look rather similar and almost any profile can be produced by pairing a wrong degradation rate to a wrong but compensating emission honti et al 2018 thus kesc values and their uncertainty intervals may provide a useful reference point for regional exposure and fate modeling by constraining the market independent transfer efficiency between the sold and emitted amounts of apis e g in form of parameter priors 4 2 strength of relation between marketed amounts and emissions effluent concentrations of apis are highly variable for different wwtps removal rates of the sewer systems and wwtps are unique and strongly dependent on the state of the system including the hydraulic residence time and temperature among others and the applied treatment technology the rate of removal fluctuates both annually seasonally and even diurnally this intrinsic variability and the uncertainties related to the input data see in section 4 3 influence the uncertainty of kesc estimates on the regional scale escape factors calculated from several monitoring datasets are likely to provide more realistic links between marketed amounts and emissions than case specific studies as the wider data foundation provides a better overview on the real variability of emissions this certainly only applies when the monitoring data are relevant for the study e g the technological level of monitored wwtps well represents the entire wwtp population of the catchment for the majority of compounds of this study kesc could be estimated with low to medium uncertainty absolute variability categories b and c 61 of apis these values suggest that the apis in these categories indeed behave along the assumptions of the model used to back calculate kesc for the rest variability category a inherent variability and a presumably important role of neglected consumption patterns i e illicit consumption or seasonal or regional differences missing from nationwide statistics non oral types of administration and transport pathways i e factory releases and accidental spills or even measurement inaccuracies precluded getting a clearly bound estimate for kesc despite the special attention paid to couple effluent measurements with representative consumption data as category a demonstrates the uncertainty of kesc estimates originates from both intrinsic variability and the uncertainty of measurements and consumption statistics used in the calculation the mathematical sensitivity analysis of even the simplest decomposition of kesc section s4 in si highlights that even the low relative uncertainty of contributing factors does not guarantee that the relative uncertainty of kesc will be correspondingly low too this purely mathematical inflation and nonlinear propagation of uncertainty means that the high relative uncertainty of kesc can be considered as its intrinsic property and in most cases it cannot be attributed to a single factor more detailed decomposition such as done by alder et al 2010 and ter laak et al 2010 is likely to aggravate this effect when emissions are calculated for a region possessing multiple wwtps the relative uncertainty of the total emission can be expected to shrink compared to the figures presented here when the wwtps involved in the calculation of kesc are statistically representative for the case the expected value will be the same as presented here the non intrinsic e g measurement bound uncertainty is definitely a confounding factor yet it is inseparable due to lack of relevant evidence for this reason we recommend considering the full uncertainty of kesc in large scale fate modeling as it reflects existing factors that contribute to the variability of emissions normalised emission factors related to kesc such as excretion rate thai et al 2016 and correction factors gracia lor et al 2016 thai et al 2019 are seldom paired with adequately quantified uncertainty mainly due to the limitations presented by the location bound and time consuming effluent measurements most studies emphasize the crucial influence of sample size e g that calculations covering multiple wwtps and larger catchments increase the robustness of estimates the simplicity of the presented approach allowed comparing a wide set of wwtp effluent data to seasonally corrected consumption statistics and thus overcoming this usual limitation 4 3 possible bias in kesc related to input data while kesc obviously defines the empirical relationship between marketed amounts and observed emissions its conceptual interpretation is difficult uncertainty of input data inevitably spoils kesc beyond the scope of intrinsic variability in this section we review the major uncertainty sources although kesc does not depend on too many assumptions one of these is that market statistics are appropriately reflecting the amount of consumed apis sources obviously missing from the market statistics like leakages from production facilities illicitly acquired drugs e g venhuis et al 2014 and veterinary applications are obviously biasing the estimates from a conceptual sense kesc will be overestimated due to the underestimated api basis the ever expanding illicit market covers almost all types of pharmaceutical drugs world health organisation who 2012 however it is impossible to quantify their exact amount hall et al 2017 veterinary applications are atypical for most of the investigated compounds except for lid tri and sul which are frequently prescribed for animals see table 1 out of these we only got kesc 1 and high estimation uncertainty for lid composite samples so a significant veterinary usage of tri and sul could not be verified it has to be noted that the contribution from veterinary medication to wwtp effluents would be subject to a high uncertainty even when the usage was known as the proportion of animal manure and urine emitted to the sewer system is strongly case specific inside the model domain there are uncertainty sources associated with each factor estimates on the local use of apis may not represent the reality well national sales data on the marketed amount of active ingredients do not include all local consumption patterns health status which is also closely linked to the consumption of apis has been shown to be associated with socioeconomic status of inhabitants such as education income occupation inequalities in health for the european countries have been shown by several studies e g mackenbach et al 2008 and this difference can also occur at regional level the lack of quarterly consumption data which was the case for e g mef may increase uncertainty in escape factor calculations when the compound is subject to periodic fluctuations in consumption or strong uneven trends errors are also introduced with the interpolations or extrapolations for years lacking consumption data different studies have not only shown seasonal variation in emitted concentrations of apis e g pereira et al 2015 vatovec et al 2016 but weekly e g moreno gonzález et al 2014 and daily variations too e g plósz et al 2010 temporal variability of consumption due to e g travelling commuting and demographic changes results in fluctuations in emissions of wwtps been et al 2014 the actual number of persons discharging into the treatment plant does not fully correspond to the number of inhabitants on which npop is based commuting may cause differences mainly on a subdaily and weekly scale while travelling might be relevant during typical holiday seasons sampling frequency and mode grab or composite of effluent concentrations at wwtps play a crucial role in representativeness of measurements to a certain period of time and they have to be designed based on the characteristics of the compound and the wwtp ort et al 2010a details on the sampling campaigns used for kesc calculations can be found in tables 2 and si4 5 measurement campaigns can be assessed for representativeness by considering the extent to which they cover temporal and spatial variability on catchment and national scale in terms of temporal variability composite samples may capture concentration peaks better than grab samples which have the potential for information loss such as in d2 multi day measurement campaigns such as in ch1 and ch2 data in ch3 are available for only two consecutive days are preferable to capture weekly variation while detection of seasonal variability can be ensured by sampling from different seasons such as in ch4 de1 and de2 possible regional variations were better represented by the swiss datasets as measurements were available for almost the whole country while in germany only for two states in addition it is true for the overall measurement campaigns in both countries that they cover all typical sizes of wwtps beside it has to be noted that the number of available measurements for each compound and campaign was highly variable which in some cases may increase the degree of uncertainty see in table si5 4 4 indirect supporting evidence for kesc values down the drain disposal of apis as compounds for this study were selected based on their presence in wwtp effluents there was no compound where calibrated escape factors could not be distinguished from 0 lowest kesc distributions were typically centered around 0 05 0 1 however for e g car mef moc and oxc documented excretion rates of the unchanged parent compound are significantly lower than this range as topical administration or veterinary application is atypical for these compounds kesc can be decomposed to estimate the proportion of api avoiding oral application for moc and oxc the escape factor was most likely dominated by kflush mef is degrading in wwtps so kesc provided a minimal estimate for down the drain disposal car is also used orally but conjugation deconjugation has been suspected in wwtps so the accuracy of estimating improper disposal is potentially low although it obviously exists kasprzyk hordern et al 2021 caldwell 2016 reported kflush estimates from industrial studies and found values spreading from 3 to 50 depending on the api time and location for germany the mean disposal rate was 14 bio intelligence service 2013 improper disposal is triggered by over prescription patient incompatibility experiencing side effects or not completing the prescribed therapy caldwell 2016 as these have different odds for different apis and therapies the typically flushed amount depends on the api with cardiovascular diseases asthma nervous system disorders and gastro intestinal tract problems being among the most affected targets caldwell 2016 mef moc and oxc fall into a frequently flushed category mef is known as a nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug nsaid that is used to treat mild to moderate pain oxc is an anticonvulsant used to treat epilepsy and it is sold as a liquid on certain markets which encourages disposal by flushing more than pills do moc is mainly prescribed to treat various forms of depression and requires a long follow up treatment after the symptoms are gone the calculated 6 15 as the minimum of down the drain disposal proportion of the marketed amount is thus in line with corresponding literature values this supports the assumptions of the model used to decompose kesc values 5 conclusions on the large catchment scale emissions of apis can be highly variable due to heterogeneities in consumption attitudes on disposal and the characteristics of the wastewater collection and treatment infrastructure the collective effect of this complex process chain can be summarised in an empirical escape factor kesc that bridges the widely available consumption data to observed emissions to surface waters when using large and high quality monitoring datasets for wwtp effluents escape factors provide an easy and simple tool for estimating total

14757,direct and indirect threats by organic micropollutants can only be reliably assessed and prevented if the exposure to these chemicals is known which in turn requires a confident estimate of their emitted amounts into the environment apis active pharmaceutical ingredients enter surface waters mostly through the sewer system and wastewater treatment plants wwtps however their effluent fluxes are highly variable and influenced by several different factors that challenge robust emission estimates here we defined a dimensionless theoretically consumption independent escape factor kesc for estimating the amount of apis expected to be present in wwtp effluents the factor is determined as the proportion of marketed and actually emitted amounts of apis a large collection of german and swiss monitoring datasets were analyzed to calculate stochastic kesc values for 31 apis reflecting both the magnitude and uncertainty of consumption normalised emissions escape factors provide an easy to use tool for the estimation of average api emissions and expected variability from numerous wwtps given that consumption data are provided thereby supporting simulation modeling of the fate of apis in stream networks or exposure assessments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords micropollutants wastewater treatment plant surface water emission effluent large scale fate modeling data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction thousands of synthetic organic chemicals are emitted into the environment many of which are bioactive by design active pharmaceutical ingredients api undoubtedly belong to this category and therefore present a potential direct threat to exposed ecosystems brodin et al 2014 cunningham et al 2006 fent 2008 halling sørensen et al 1998 länge and dietrich 2002 petrie et al 2015 and indirectly to the humans relying on these ecosystems services e g cunningham et al 2010 emmanuel et al 2009 peng et al 2016 such threats can only be reliably assessed and prevented if the exposure to these chemicals is known which in turn requires a confident estimate of their emissions into the environment namely into the most important receiving bodies surface waters emissions to surface waters can be traced back to two principal human activities production and use of pharmaceuticals emissions may occur when a chemical is synthesised i e from production facilities through accidental leaks or through routine wastewater disposal if the applied treatment technology is not capable of removing the compound completely anliker et al 2022 2020a 2020b cardoso et al 2014 emara et al 2019 the contribution of this pathway to total emissions is estimated to be in the range of a mere few percents except for some developing countries with highly concentrated pharmaceutical industries caldwell 2016 on the more important consumer side there are two partially intertwined pathways incorporating a complex sequence of loss processes occurring from purchasing the chemical to actual emissions into surface waters delli compagni et al 2020 after purchase the two consumer pathways get separated the shorter unintended usage branch actually avoids human consumption and often involves direct disposal to sewage while the proper usage branch follows the sequence of consumption metabolism where applicable and excretion or other type of emission halling sørensen et al 1998 the two pathways rejoin in the sewer system from where apis travel to the communal wastewater treatment facilities and finally towards the point of emission of the treated sewage of these possible emission pathways for apis the proper usage pathway is usually the largest caldwell 2016 corresponding to a mostly rational behavior from both producers and consumers pharmaceutical consumption may have long term year to year variability that is influenced by the characteristics of the population the actual epidemiological situation and the change in medical technology van der aa et al 2011 consumption may be steady or seasonal in a year depending on the pathological feature targeted by the api drugs entering the human body undergo four main processes absorption distribution metabolism and excretion which are affected by several factors such as characteristics of the api dose of intake and health conditions caldwell et al 1995 hilmer et al 2007 after entering the sewer system apis may undergo various chemical and biological transformations in the sewer system particularly in the receiving wastewater treatment plants wwtps the latter may sometimes be circumvented and apis may enter surface waters without treatment in case of active combined sewer overflows launay et al 2016 to describe this series of processes in detail would require measurements after each phase yet the majority of relevant studies concentrate on removal processes inside the wwtp see e g kasprzyk hordern et al 2009 oberoi et al 2019 patrolecco et al 2015 wang et al 2020 whereas only few target sewer networks themselves gao et al 2017 jelic et al 2015 mccall et al 2016 o brien et al 2017 thai et al 2014 due to the difficulty of sampling and the high variability of sources and pollutant transport ort et al 2010a 2010b in the end this series of linked processes produces high spatial and temporal variability in effluent and surface water concentrations baker et al 2014 burns et al 2018 daneshvar et al 2010 vieno et al 2005 around the complex chain of transport and transformation processes between an api s synthesis and its entering the surface waters the most robust long term data available are commercial sales information for apis used in human medication such statistics have been collected regularly since many decades in regional and quarterly resolution at both product and api levels to monitor the effectiveness of pharmaceutical marketing to use this data source for estimating emissions from effluents of several wwtps a mapping method has to be found that bridges sales consumption to emissions to surface waters a related inverse method is routinely used in wastewater based epidemiology the so called correction factors are used to back calculate consumptions from measured loads of drugs see e g baker et al 2014 duan et al 2022 gracia lor et al 2016 van nuijs et al 2011 zuccato et al 2005 thai et al 2016 2019 reversed this definition and defined the correction factor as the ratio of daily consumption and daily load in wastewater that beside estimating consumption or excretion rates can also be used to calculate concentrations in the sewer network from consumption thai et al 2016 2019 yet these all exclude the wwtp itself which is the major source of pharmaceuticals to surface waters daughton and ternes 1999 in this study we apply a new lumped treatment to the series of processes between sales of 31 apis and the corresponding effluents of wwtps based on national sales data and effluent concentration measurements it was tested in the period of 2010 2019 at several wwtps from germany and switzerland whether consumption statistics can be used to estimate api emissions regionally i e for a multitude of wwtps at once we define a dimensionless escape factor kesc as the proportion of the marketed apis appearing in wwtp effluents with the objective to deliver a less case specific indicator of the transfer of marketed pharmaceuticals into surface waters which can then be used to estimate emissions over multiple wwtps some former studies used a somewhat similar approach to estimate wwtp effluent concentrations from annual national sales data alder et al 2010 ter laak et al 2010 however these studies were carried out on a narrower set of wwtps and compounds and focused on the conceptual description of involved factors such as metabolism and removal instead of trying to gather a wider body of empirical evidence alder et al 2010 ter laak et al 2010 by its definition kesc integrates all of the above mentioned processes in a single number that should theoretically be between 0 marketed api is not emitted to surface waters at all and 1 the entire marketed amount in the catchment reaches the rivers unless releases from production formation in the sewer system or in the wwtp or veterinary usage of an active ingredient are significant 2 materials and methods 2 1 the escape factor the lumped escape factor is defined simply as the ratio between the marketed amount of the api and the amount showing up in wwtp effluent 1 f eff k esc f cons n pop where feff is the flux in the effluent ng d 1 fcons is the mean per capita marketed daily dosage of the api ng d 1 and npop is the population connected to the wwtp the escape factor as defined by eq 1 fully describes the relationship between marketed amount and emissions for analytical purposes the escape factor can be decomposed into parts describing known transport and transformation mechanisms if the oral administration pathway is assumed to be dominating kesc can be decomposed into the following form 2 k e s c 1 k f l u s h k e x c k f l u s h 1 k r e m where kexc is the excreted fraction of the non metabolized api from the body dimensionless krem is the removal efficiency in the wastewater infrastructure i e the sewer network and the wwtp dimensionless and kflush is the fraction of the marketed amount entering the sewer system without ingestion dimensionless the improperly disposed down the drain fraction is more dependent on the targeted disease class and prescribed application method than the bio chemical properties of the api caldwell 2016 its parameter kflush can be roughly estimated for apis with known very low kexc and krem from eq 2 one could further extend eq 2 by adding factors representing e g separate transformation in the sewer system and in the wwtp deconjugation delli compagni et al 2020 loads from topical application kannan et al 2023 etc yet in the absence of relevant data from the targeted spatial scale this would not contribute to a better estmation of emissions for multiple wwtps in practice kesc can be estimated from marketing and effluent data by rearranging eq 1 3 k e s c c e f f q e f f f c o n s n p o p where ceff is the characteristic concentration of the api in the wwtp effluent ng l 1 depending on the time scale of the study and qeff is the corresponding discharge measurement l d 1 the task is to find the relevant values of fcons and npop that can be used in combination with existing measurements of ceff and qeff 2 2 apis and their sales we selected 31 widely used apis that often show up in surface waters of europe in significant quantities table 1 shows the relevant properties related to kesc calculations main fields and types of application usage in veterinary medicine and significant seasonal variability in consumption as the subjects of our analysis api sales data for the actual amount of active ingredients kg per

2018 all consumption data referred to human medical usage thus excluding other e g veterinary applications 2 3 wwtp data wwtp effluent data were obtained from four swiss and two german monitoring campaigns from the rhine and rhône catchments table 2 swiss data were provided by eawag swiss federal institute of aquatic science and technology and vsa verband schweizer abwasser und gewässerschutzfachleute association of swiss experts on wastewater and water protection german data were provided by the lubw landesanstalt für umwelt baden württemberg state environment institute baden württemberg and lanuv landesamt für natur umwelt und verbraucherschutz nordrhein westfalen state office for nature environment and consumer protection north rhine westphalia emitted fluxes were calculated as the product of sample concentrations with the corresponding discharge which may have been directly measured or estimated long term effluent discharge see remark column in table 2 additional information on the characteristics of measurement campaigns can be found in tables si4 and si5 in supporting information si the number of inhabitants actually connected to the wwtp npop is relevant to calculate kesc see eq 3 datasets of the two german de1 and de2 and one of the swiss campaigns ch4 contained information on the served population for the wwtps for the other swiss wwtps served population data were collected from two sources data from 2005 were gained from the database of maps of switzerland federal office of topography swisstopo 2018 as values characteristic for the initial years data for 2017 were collected from the webpage of the swiss federal agency for bafu das bundesamt für umwelt swiss federal agency for environment 2018 wherever it was possible actual served population values from the year of the sampling campaign were used in other cases we determined them by interpolating from other years or when data gaps were too frequent for interpolation by taking values from the closest available year 2 4 pairing consumption with effluent concentrations consumption data contained significant year to year and seasonal changes for numerous compounds long term trends reflect the dynamics of the market share of a specific api however consumption can also vary seasonally which may be significant for apis prescribed for seasonally appearing symptoms e g for allergy and flu to get a precise estimate of kesc it was important to match fcons to the period when effluent concentrations were measured as much as possible otherwise consumption dynamics would seriously bias kesc the fcons is equal to the mean quarterly consumption the annual marketed amount multiplied with a seasonality factor f q see in table si1 divided by the population of the given year both on country level the highest temporal resolution of consumption data was quarterly but this was limited to germany and only available for two years therefore we applied a multiplicative interpolation model of consumption dynamics that was used to estimate quarterly consumption from the annual data 4 c y q c y s c q 4 c y 1 c y f q where c y q is consumption kg quarter in the qth quarter of year y cy is the mean quarterly consumption of the given year y kg quarter cy 1 is the mean quarterly consumption in the next year and q is the quarter index 1 4 sc is the slope of the local subannual trend in year y kg year and f q is the seasonal multiplicator dimensionless with the mean of 1 over all quarters the consumption model in eq 4 was fitted for each compound four steps fig 1 1 first long term trends were fitted for switzerland and germany separately to estimate mean annual values cy for years with effluent concentration measurements but with no consumption data in other cases national sales data were used as cy as the swiss data for 2009 were given as semi closed intervals for some compounds by singer and coworkers singer et al 2016 this year was included in the calculations in two alternative ways depending on the type of estimation explicit values were directly used for the consumption in 2009 when ranges were provided e g consumption was higher than or equal to a given limit value the final value for 2009 was decided based on a linear trend analysis the linear regression value for 2009 was accepted when it fell into the range specified by singer et al 2016 otherwise the closer limit value of the interval was used based on the position of data gaps extrapolation or interpolation was used to fill in missing annual values between 2010 and 2019 2 after estimating the long term trends local subannual trends were calculated the mean annual consumptions cy for two adjacent years were taken as the consumption in the first quarters of the years between these two values a linear trend was set as the subannual change inside a year the slope of this subannual trend is sc and the mean annual consumptions were calculated for the other three quarters with always 3 months shifting 3 as the next step f q seasonality factors were determined for each compound based on the quarterly consumption data for germany 2017 2018 seasonal variability was assumed to be country independent thus f q determined from the german quarterly datasets was applied to all the other years both in the german and swiss consumption time series to determine seasonal variability of consumption within a year that is assumed to be nearly constant from year to year we eliminated the trend component from the quarterly consumption time series decomposition meant to separate the time series into trend and seasonality components a multiplicative model was used in decomposition detection of trend requires smoothing the time series using the centered moving average method render et al 2018 as quarterly summarized consumption data were available for 2 years and there were 4 data points per year moving average window of 4 was applied then f q could be determined from the ratio between the actual consumption and the trendline 4 quarterly consumptions were calculated for each year without quarterly sales data based on f q values mean annual consumptions cy were multiplied by the seasonality factors to actually pair consumption with effluent concentrations we used the following algorithm 1 if quarterly consumption data was available for a compound estimated consumption for the corresponding year and month of the effluent concentration measurements were used by applying eq 3 2 if quarterly consumption data was not available but annual was annual consumption from the corresponding year of the effluent concentration measurements was used 3 results 3 1 market trends and seasonality seasonal multiplicators f q were calculated for all compounds see in table si1 from the quarterly datasets of germany 2017 2018 cla fex and phe showed significant seasonal variability for all other apis seasonal changes were negligible cla is an antibiotic to cure bacterial infections related mainly to the respiratory system with highly increasing consumption in the first quarter of the year 50 and lower consumption in warmer months fex is mostly used to treat allergy symptoms accordingly it has a pronounced peak 52 in consumption in the second quarter of the year phe is a pain reliever and fever reducing drug it shows a moderate 10 increase in consumption in the first quarter of the year which can be explained by its use related to flu like illnesses typical during the colder seasons 3 2 escape factors escape factors were calculated separately from all six datasets see table si2 depending on data availability not all compounds had been measured in all datasets for all compounds mean kesc e kesc values and standard deviations sd kesc were estimated across the six datasets both country based de studies and ch studies columns in table 3 and completely pooled all studies column in table 3 statistics were produced by using weighted unique escape factors weights were determined based on the time interval represented by the samples with weight of grab samples set to 1 hour and composite samples set to the actual sampling interval again in hours table 3 when it was possible to calculate escape factors for the same compound in both countries the results could be compared as it can be expected from its consumption independent definition escape factors of a given substance should be very similar in switzerland and germany given that wastewater treatment technologies are similar too this assumption was better fulfilled in the first half of the period of analysis the development of wastewater treatment plants equipped with the fourth treatment stage multiplied after the corresponding regulations were accepted in 2016 for switzerland metz 2017 and in 2018 for germany bmu uba 2019 thus most of the effluent datasets used in this study are obtained from plants that have not yet been upgraded to the date of measurements in most of the cases national kesc estimates were indeed similar e g ami car cla lam mto sul ven still in a few cases major differences were detected in escape factors between the two countries e g ate bez gab hyd tri val moreover for certain compounds calculated escapes rate values were higher than 1 which would mean negative removal rates or excretion over 100 while such findings are to some extent related to uncertainty in sampling and analytical quantification they might also stem from non representative consumption data or formation of the api from conjugated metabolites in the wwtp formation of parent apis in wwtp was identified for some of the target compounds with occasional supporting literature evidence see e g verlicchi et al 2012 for car and tri sipma et al 2010 for dic and sul values greater than 3 were not included in the calculation of e kesc and sd kesc due to their high uncertainty for the ch4 dataset e kesc and sd kesc values were also calculated separately for all quarters of the year yet there was no significant change compared to annual values see table si3 thus it can be concluded that the effect of seasonally variable processes such as the removal rate of wwtps are negligible compared to the overall variability of escape factors observed for instance at the cantonal or country level 3 3 variability of emissions from wwtps

category list variability could only be considered as randomness as we found no significant deterministic relations between the individual kesc estimates and potential influencing factors that were covered by data e g the effect of seasons wwtp size or the relative contribution of industrial sewage randomness can of course originate from the variability of factors contributing to kesc but the final level of uncertainty is modulated by their expected values too see section s4 in si removal rates of sewer systems and wwtps are strongly dependent on the physico chemical characteristics of the micropollutant the composition of wastewater the state of the system the treatment technology and they thus may vary in a wide range sewer systems gao et al 2017 jelic et al 2015 o brien et al 2017 thai et al 2014 wwtps cirja et al 2008 petrie et al 2015 sipma et al 2010 for some of the compounds in the high variability category highly variable wwtp removal rates are known too bez gab petrie et al 2015 ate sipma et al 2010 for the other compounds in the category we are not aware of relevant studies specifically there was no significant relation to wwtp size although we initially expected the smaller plants to work somewhat less efficiently than the large ones there appeared to be some weak connection between variability and the season of sampling in the swiss campaigns but the same did not show up in the german datasets and it turned out that the wwtp size classes in swiss campaigns were not evenly distributed seasonally i e the few large plants were sampled in the spring while smaller plants were sampled both in the spring and late summer where known the proportion of industrial sewage did not correlate with kesc thus the roles of krem and potential production related emissions could not be properly resolved given the available data 3 4 estimation of kflush values if kesc is decomposed along assumptions on the pathways between marketed amounts and emissions hypotheses can be tested on its components we use eq 2 to show such an application for estimating down the drain disposal of apis which can contribute to the emissions significantly kasprzyk hordern et al 2021 in eq 2 the portion of marketed apis that reach the sewer network without prior ingestion is accounted for as kflush the simplicity of eq 2 implies that compounds must fulfill several criteria that this decomposition remains meaningful i they are unable to conjugate deconjugate within the sewer system and wwtps ii human topical administration or veterinary usage is negligible and iii they have insignificant input from production facilities which may change with time anliker et al 2020a even under such strict conditions there are still three factors contributing to kesc so one cannot identify them from kesc alone to overcome this we selected compounds for which kexc is known to be negligible this condition eliminates the impact of the proper usage pathway from eq 2 four compounds with very low excretion rates were investigated for which urine is the main clearance pathway and excretion efficiency is known namely car with an excretion rate of unchanged parent compound in urine kexc 0 01 lienert et al 2007 mef with kexc 0 02 naseer et al 2007 moc with kexc 0 01 jauch et al 1990 and oxc with kexc 0 01 fda u s food and drug administration 2020 among these car is actually an outlier because it does not fulfill criterion i back formation has been observed by several studies e g vieno et al 2007 for the other compounds kesc is the direct conservative minimal estimate for kflush mef kesc mean 0 03 moc kesc mean 0 12 oxc kesc mean 0 15 using data from all studies because assuming that kesc kflush neglects removal in the sewer system and the wwtp for car the appropriateness of kesc in estimating kflush is uncertain further on wwtp removal rates are known to be negligible for moc and oxc so for them kesc is not only a minimal but a representative estimate for the proportion of improper usage pathway in contrast removal can be significant for mef tauxe wuersch et al 2005 50 kasprzyk hordern et al 2008 70 so kflush is expected to be 2 3 3 times greater than kesc 4 discussion 4 1 scope of apis in this paper a collection of relative emission estimations is presented for 31 widely used apis based on a broad monitoring dataset from several campaigns from two countries according to our best knowledge this is the so far largest analysis ever performed on estimating emissions from consumption data somewhat similar earlier studies concentrated on only a few compounds du et al 2020 gao et al 2021 thai et al 2016 2019 the demand for more reliable data on emissions and environmental behavior of chemicals is increasing due to interest in pec predicted environmental concentration values prioritization of compounds and developing risk mitigation strategies tong et al 2022 emissions are the backbone of exposure and in situ fate calculations marketed amounts of apis are often considered as the most robust reference points when wwtp in or effluent data are not available or not indicative for example when a high number of wwtps are involved in exposure assessment see oldenkamp et al 2018 and references cited therein therefore many regional exposure or fate models utilize parameters closely related to the here defined escape factor e g grill et al 2016 lindim et al 2016 oldenkamp et al 2018 as shown by the case specific escape factor values the transfer efficiency between market and actual emissions is highly variable therefore related parameters are optimal subjects for calibration however it is very difficult to identify emissions from in stream concentration or flux profiles along rivers as longitudinal flux profiles belonging to a wide range of first order degradation and emission rates look rather similar and almost any profile can be produced by pairing a wrong degradation rate to a wrong but compensating emission honti et al 2018 thus kesc values and their uncertainty intervals may provide a useful reference point for regional exposure and fate modeling by constraining the market independent transfer efficiency between the sold and emitted amounts of apis e g in form of parameter priors 4 2 strength of relation between marketed amounts and emissions effluent concentrations of apis are highly variable for different wwtps removal rates of the sewer systems and wwtps are unique and strongly dependent on the state of the system including the hydraulic residence time and temperature among others and the applied treatment technology the rate of removal fluctuates both annually seasonally and even diurnally this intrinsic variability and the uncertainties related to the input data see in section 4 3 influence the uncertainty of kesc estimates on the regional scale escape factors calculated from several monitoring datasets are likely to provide more realistic links between marketed amounts and emissions than case specific studies as the wider data foundation provides a better overview on the real variability of emissions this certainly only applies when the monitoring data are relevant for the study e g the technological level of monitored wwtps well represents the entire wwtp population of the catchment for the majority of compounds of this study kesc could be estimated with low to medium uncertainty absolute variability categories b and c 61 of apis these values suggest that the apis in these categories indeed behave along the assumptions of the model used to back calculate kesc for the rest variability category a inherent variability and a presumably important role of neglected consumption patterns i e illicit consumption or seasonal or regional differences missing from nationwide statistics non oral types of administration and transport pathways i e factory releases and accidental spills or even measurement inaccuracies precluded getting a clearly bound estimate for kesc despite the special attention paid to couple effluent measurements with representative consumption data as category a demonstrates the uncertainty of kesc estimates originates from both intrinsic variability and the uncertainty of measurements and consumption statistics used in the calculation the mathematical sensitivity analysis of even the simplest decomposition of kesc section s4 in si highlights that even the low relative uncertainty of contributing factors does not guarantee that the relative uncertainty of kesc will be correspondingly low too this purely mathematical inflation and nonlinear propagation of uncertainty means that the high relative uncertainty of kesc can be considered as its intrinsic property and in most cases it cannot be attributed to a single factor more detailed decomposition such as done by alder et al 2010 and ter laak et al 2010 is likely to aggravate this effect when emissions are calculated for a region possessing multiple wwtps the relative uncertainty of the total emission can be expected to shrink compared to the figures presented here when the wwtps involved in the calculation of kesc are statistically representative for the case the expected value will be the same as presented here the non intrinsic e g measurement bound uncertainty is definitely a confounding factor yet it is inseparable due to lack of relevant evidence for this reason we recommend considering the full uncertainty of kesc in large scale fate modeling as it reflects existing factors that contribute to the variability of emissions normalised emission factors related to kesc such as excretion rate thai et al 2016 and correction factors gracia lor et al 2016 thai et al 2019 are seldom paired with adequately quantified uncertainty mainly due to the limitations presented by the location bound and time consuming effluent measurements most studies emphasize the crucial influence of sample size e g that calculations covering multiple wwtps and larger catchments increase the robustness of estimates the simplicity of the presented approach allowed comparing a wide set of wwtp effluent data to seasonally corrected consumption statistics and thus overcoming this usual limitation 4 3 possible bias in kesc related to input data while kesc obviously defines the empirical relationship between marketed amounts and observed emissions its conceptual interpretation is difficult uncertainty of input data inevitably spoils kesc beyond the scope of intrinsic variability in this section we review the major uncertainty sources although kesc does not depend on too many assumptions one of these is that market statistics are appropriately reflecting the amount of consumed apis sources obviously missing from the market statistics like leakages from production facilities illicitly acquired drugs e g venhuis et al 2014 and veterinary applications are obviously biasing the estimates from a conceptual sense kesc will be overestimated due to the underestimated api basis the ever expanding illicit market covers almost all types of pharmaceutical drugs world health organisation who 2012 however it is impossible to quantify their exact amount hall et al 2017 veterinary applications are atypical for most of the investigated compounds except for lid tri and sul which are frequently prescribed for animals see table 1 out of these we only got kesc 1 and high estimation uncertainty for lid composite samples so a significant veterinary usage of tri and sul could not be verified it has to be noted that the contribution from veterinary medication to wwtp effluents would be subject to a high uncertainty even when the usage was known as the proportion of animal manure and urine emitted to the sewer system is strongly case specific inside the model domain there are uncertainty sources associated with each factor estimates on the local use of apis may not represent the reality well national sales data on the marketed amount of active ingredients do not include all local consumption patterns health status which is also closely linked to the consumption of apis has been shown to be associated with socioeconomic status of inhabitants such as education income occupation inequalities in health for the european countries have been shown by several studies e g mackenbach et al 2008 and this difference can also occur at regional level the lack of quarterly consumption data which was the case for e g mef may increase uncertainty in escape factor calculations when the compound is subject to periodic fluctuations in consumption or strong uneven trends errors are also introduced with the interpolations or extrapolations for years lacking consumption data different studies have not only shown seasonal variation in emitted concentrations of apis e g pereira et al 2015 vatovec et al 2016 but weekly e g moreno gonzález et al 2014 and daily variations too e g plósz et al 2010 temporal variability of consumption due to e g travelling commuting and demographic changes results in fluctuations in emissions of wwtps been et al 2014 the actual number of persons discharging into the treatment plant does not fully correspond to the number of inhabitants on which npop is based commuting may cause differences mainly on a subdaily and weekly scale while travelling might be relevant during typical holiday seasons sampling frequency and mode grab or composite of effluent concentrations at wwtps play a crucial role in representativeness of measurements to a certain period of time and they have to be designed based on the characteristics of the compound and the wwtp ort et al 2010a details on the sampling campaigns used for kesc calculations can be found in tables 2 and si4 5 measurement campaigns can be assessed for representativeness by considering the extent to which they cover temporal and spatial variability on catchment and national scale in terms of temporal variability composite samples may capture concentration peaks better than grab samples which have the potential for information loss such as in d2 multi day measurement campaigns such as in ch1 and ch2 data in ch3 are available for only two consecutive days are preferable to capture weekly variation while detection of seasonal variability can be ensured by sampling from different seasons such as in ch4 de1 and de2 possible regional variations were better represented by the swiss datasets as measurements were available for almost the whole country while in germany only for two states in addition it is true for the overall measurement campaigns in both countries that they cover all typical sizes of wwtps beside it has to be noted that the number of available measurements for each compound and campaign was highly variable which in some cases may increase the degree of uncertainty see in table si5 4 4 indirect supporting evidence for kesc values down the drain disposal of apis as compounds for this study were selected based on their presence in wwtp effluents there was no compound where calibrated escape factors could not be distinguished from 0 lowest kesc distributions were typically centered around 0 05 0 1 however for e g car mef moc and oxc documented excretion rates of the unchanged parent compound are significantly lower than this range as topical administration or veterinary application is atypical for these compounds kesc can be decomposed to estimate the proportion of api avoiding oral application for moc and oxc the escape factor was most likely dominated by kflush mef is degrading in wwtps so kesc provided a minimal estimate for down the drain disposal car is also used orally but conjugation deconjugation has been suspected in wwtps so the accuracy of estimating improper disposal is potentially low although it obviously exists kasprzyk hordern et al 2021 caldwell 2016 reported kflush estimates from industrial studies and found values spreading from 3 to 50 depending on the api time and location for germany the mean disposal rate was 14 bio intelligence service 2013 improper disposal is triggered by over prescription patient incompatibility experiencing side effects or not completing the prescribed therapy caldwell 2016 as these have different odds for different apis and therapies the typically flushed amount depends on the api with cardiovascular diseases asthma nervous system disorders and gastro intestinal tract problems being among the most affected targets caldwell 2016 mef moc and oxc fall into a frequently flushed category mef is known as a nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug nsaid that is used to treat mild to moderate pain oxc is an anticonvulsant used to treat epilepsy and it is sold as a liquid on certain markets which encourages disposal by flushing more than pills do moc is mainly prescribed to treat various forms of depression and requires a long follow up treatment after the symptoms are gone the calculated 6 15 as the minimum of down the drain disposal proportion of the marketed amount is thus in line with corresponding literature values this supports the assumptions of the model used to decompose kesc values 5 conclusions on the large catchment scale emissions of apis can be highly variable due to heterogeneities in consumption attitudes on disposal and the characteristics of the wastewater collection and treatment infrastructure the collective effect of this complex process chain can be summarised in an empirical escape factor kesc that bridges the widely available consumption data to observed emissions to surface waters when using large and high quality monitoring datasets for wwtp effluents escape factors provide an easy and simple tool for estimating total

14758,enteric disease remains one of the most common concerns for public health particularly when it results from human exposure to surface and recreational waters contaminated with wastewater characterizing the temporal and spatial variation of enteric pathogens prevalent in wastewater is critical to develop approaches to mitigate their distribution in the environment in this study we aim to characterize pathogen variability and test the applicability of the human associated wastewater indicator crassphage as an indicator of enteric viral and bacterial pathogens we conducted weekly samplings for 14 months from four wastewater treatment plants in north carolina usa untreated wastewater samples were processed using hollow fiber ultrafiltration followed by secondary concentration methods adenovirus norovirus enterovirus salmonella shiga toxin 2 stx2 campylobacter and crassphage were measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr and reverse transcriptase rt qpcr our results revealed significant correlations between crassphage and human adenovirus enterovirus norovirus salmonella and campylobacter p 0 01 pathogens and crassphage concentrations in untreated wastewater showed distinct seasonal patterns with peak concentrations of crassphage and viral pathogens in fall and winter while bacterial pathogens showed peaked concentrations in either winter campylobacter fall salmonella or summer stx2 this study enhances the understanding of crassphage as an alternative molecular indicator for both bacterial and viral pathogens the findings of this study can also inform microbial modeling efforts for the prediction of the impact of wastewater pathogens on surface waters due to increased flooding events and wastewater overflows associated with climate

school closures and economic burdens buzby and roberts 2009 enteric pathogens such as noroviruses rotaviruses salmonella pathogenic escherichia coli and cryptosporidium remain one of the public health concerns following exposure to contaminated waters the latest u s environmental protection agency epa contaminant candidate list ccl4 contained 12 microbial contaminants including human adenoviruses enteroviruses noroviruses salmonella enterica campylobacter jejuni e coli o157 and shigella sonnei one of the challenges to detect enteric pathogens in environmental water samples is their low ambient concentrations thus direct detection without multi step sample processing may not be possible mccall et al 2020 traditionally culturable methods for fecal indicator fecal coliforms e coli enterococci and coliphages have been used for water quality assessment epa 2009a b 2018 two drawbacks of these cultivation based procedures are that most require 18 h or more to produce results and cannot track sources of fecal contamination making it challenging to inform water safety managers on the same day advances in molecular methods particularly pcr based methods offer an attractive alternative for improved and rapid detection of a diverse group of microbial targets in water gene markers assays including us epa method 1609 1 for enterococci epa method 1696 for the human fecal marker hf183 and coliphages phix174 and ms2 assays have been applied in water remediation programs and provide rapid same day water quality notification epa 2019 seurinck et al 2005 turgeon et al 2014 however an ideal pathogen and fecal indicator should be present in high concentration in source water and correlate with both viral and bacterial etiologic agents that cause enteric diseases recently crassphage cross

peccia 2013 crank et al 2019 farkas et al 2019 stachler et al 2014 detected crassphage in high abundance in the human gut by metagenomic analysis and later found it is highly associated with human fecal contamination stachler and bibby 2014 stachler et al 2017 however the correlations between the crassphage marker and enteric pathogens in wastewater remain to be defined across geographic locations and seasons studies have demonstrated that enteric diseases e g gastroenteritis exhibit seasonal patterns in the communities with higher number of cases during winter and spring o brien and xagoraraki 2019 thwiny et al 2022 however the leading and dominant enteric pathogen in different seasons and the spatial variability i e different treatment plants have not been fully clarified the objectives of this study were to 1 assess effectiveness of the emerging wastewater crassphage marker as a microbial water quality indicator for both enteric viral and bacterial pathogens and 2 identify the dynamics of the enteric pathogens throughout the seasons by characterizing the temporal and spatial variation of viral and bacterial pathogens in untreated wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater sampling composited untreated wastewater samples 24 h flow weighted were collected biweekly from two wastewater treatment plants wwtps located in the raleigh durham chapel hill metropolitan area rdcma nc rtp1 and rtp2 in addition weekly samples were collected from two wwtps located in charlotte charlotte1 and charlotte2 nc fig 1 five litres wastewater samples were processed in the first two months of the sampling events and three litres of wastewater samples were processed for the rest of the sampling period due to the high turbidity of the samples samples were collected in sterile 1 l nalgene bottles at each site following collection the wastewater samples were transported to the laboratory in coolers packed with ice deionized water in a 1 l nalgene sample collection bottle was used as field blanks the collected samples were processed for primary concentration within 24 h after arriving at the laboratory samples from rtp1 and rtp2 were processed for primary concentration at the environmental protection agency epa laboratory in research triangle park while samples from charlotte1 and charlotte2 were processed at the university of north carolina charlotte environmental water laboratory all secondary concentrations were performed at the epa lab a total of 147 raw wastewater samples were collected during 73 sampling events in 14 months january 2021 to february 2022 charlotte1 and rtp1 were sampled from january 2021 to february 2022 sampling events for charlotte2 were conducted from june 2021 to february 2022 sampling events for rtp 2 were conducted from february 2021 to february 2022 the characteristics of each wwtp are shown in table 1 2 2 sample processing and concentrating due to the covid 19 pandemic wastewater samples have the potential of

bacteria and viruses is shown in fig 2 wastewater samples were processed using a dead end hollow fiber ultrafiltration d hfuf procedure followed by secondary concentration as described below wastewater 3 l to 5 l was filtered through the dead end hollow fiber ultrafilter rexeed 15s dial medical supply chester springs pa using a peristaltic pump masterflex l s easy load cole parmer vernon hills il usa set at 300 rpm the rexeed 15s filter was stabilized by a ring stand with utility clamp and the filters were eluted by passing 200 ml of elution solution to obtain the first eluate mcminn et al 2021 the sample and filtration information were recorded on a chain of custody record form for bacterial pathogen analysis 20 ml of the first eluate was filtered through a 0 45 mm filter hawp04700 millipore bedford ma in duplicate fig 2 after filtration the filter was transferred to the extraction tubes containing 0 1 mm glass beads provided in the qiagen powerlyzer powersoil extraction kit qiagen valencia ca usa and saved at 80 c for enteric virus analysis the rest of the first eluate approximately 160 ml was further processed using a beef extract and celite method modified from epa method 1615 cashdollar et al 2013 mcminn et al 2012 briefly 1 5 w v beef extract powder was added to the eluate while slowly stirring on a stir plate in the meantime 0 1 g per 100 ml celite and 1 n hcl dropwise were added into the concentrate and stabilized for 10 min to reach a pellet to 4 0 to bind virus particles via organic flocculation the first eluate was then centrifuged at 3800 x g for 10 min and pellet was saved the pellet was resuspended in 8 ml of phosphate buffered saline pbs at a ph of 9 to 9 5 and centrifuged again at 6000 x g for 15 mins to release the virus into the liquid phase the supernatant secondary eluate was saved into 500 ml aliquots and preserved at 80 c for nucleic acid extraction after filtration through a 0 2 µm filter processed samples were analyzed for molecular assays within six months of sample collection 2 3 nucleic acid extraction and analysis for enteric viruses dna and rna were extracted from 200 μl secondary eluate using qiagen

an additional ethanol wash before nucleic acid elution to alleviate pcr inhibition each sample was extracted in duplicate with a reagent blank molecular grade water in each extraction batch the final elution volume for each extraction was 100 μl which was then divided into 30 μl aliquots and stored at 80 c 2 4 detection and quantification using qpcr and rt qpcr for human adenoviruses and bacterial pathogen targets stx2 campylobacter and salmonella extracted dna samples were diluted five fold and quantified by qpcr enterovirus and norovirus were quantified using a two step rt qpcr detailed method descriptions are included in the supplementary material a five point standard curve ranging from 104 to 3 gene copy gc reaction was included with samples in each reaction plate for each pathogen assay idt gblocks were used for standard curves and positive controls idt coralville ia usa for crassphage the standard curve ranged from 107 to 103 gc reaction due to its abundance in untreated wastewater the assays efficiencies were 90 110 and linearities r squared values were above 0 98 based on standard curves detection limit was three copies per reaction or 1000 gc l lower measurement limit inhibition of the samples was determined by performing hf183 internal amplification control iac multiplex assay as described in epa method 1696 the inhibition of the samples was evaluated by comparing the iac threshold as previously described epa 2019 three no template controls ntcs using molecular grade water were included with each instrument run untreated wastewater has high organic content and it often leads to inhibition in qpcr analysis uchii et al 2019 we found inhibition in all the undiluted samples therefore after performing a range of dilutions in the extracted samples a fivefold dilution was determined to provide the best balance between the detection of the target and dilution of the inhibition 2 5 statistical analyses all statistics were computed using rstudio version 2022 2 0 443 qpcr data was log10 transformed and its normality was tested by the qq plot function the microbial targets were grouped into four different seasons spring march to may 2021 summer june to august 2021 fall september to november 2021 and winter december 2021 to february 2022 for spatial variation samples were grouped into four different sites rtp1 rtp2 charlotte1 charlotte2 a one way analysis of variance anova was used to investigate significance between mean concentrations of select pathogens in wastewater samples tukey s honestly significant difference test tukey s hsd was used to find means that are significantly different from each other for seasonal and spatial variation comparisons correlation structure between the wastewater indicator crassphage and enteric pathogens pair by pair was evaluated using spearman r coefficient as a non parametric measure for its robustness toward influential data points and outliers singh et al 2004 with p value cutoffs of 0 05 finally for measurements reported as non detects or below the lower measurement limit the non detected nd designation was substituted with half of the square root of the detection limit 15 8 gc l non metric multidimensional scaling nmds analysis was performed on analytical composites of the enteric pathogen assays human adenovirus enterovirus norovirus stx2 salmonella campylobacter a confidence interval of 0 7 was used to delineate data ellipses 3 results and discussion the objectives of this study were to characterize the temporal and spatial dynamics of enteric pathogens in untreated wastewater in north carolina and to evaluate the correlations between crassphage and enteric pathogens in wastewater throughout different seasons no template controls were negative in each assay suggesting no cross contamination the limit of detection lod was 3 gene copies gc reaction for pathogen assays and samples below this concentration were considered non detects since crassphage was always detected in high abundance lod was not applied to crassphage 3 1 concentrations and prevalence of crassphage and enteric pathogens the sampling sites in north carolina are in the humid sub tropical climate zone with very warm summers and moderately cold winters we collected 24 h composite samples based on previous studies virus abundance in composite samples is more representative of viral concentrations than grab samples ahmed et al 2021 all untreated wastewater samples were positive for the crassphage marker table 2 fig 3 we observed the lowest crassphage concentrations at charlotte1 on 5 5 2021 and the highest concentration at charlotte2 on 8 9 2021 tables 1 and 2 the crassphage concentrations reported in our study 107 1010 gc l in untreated wastewater aligns with concentrations reported by others including studies in florida italy and japan ahmed et al 2018a crank et al 2020 malla et al 2019 high abundance of crassphage marker in untreated wastewater suggests that crassphage could serve as an indicator for wastewater contamination in subtropical climate regions sabar et al 2022 the concentrations of viral and bacterial pathogen targets in wastewater are shown in table 2 and enteric viruses showed high detection frequency above 85 the observed concentrations agreed with previous studies mccall et al 2021 o brien et al 2017 human adenoviruses are known to cause gastroenteritis and respiratory diseases ganesh and lin 2013 maunula et al 2008 papapetropoulou and vantarakis 1998 the highest adenovirus concentration was observed on 8 9 2021 at charlotte 2 enterovirus can cause an array of afflictions depending on the virus type including viral sinusitis common cold meningitis and poliomyelitis and have been linked to outbreaks of these diseases maunula et al 2008 the highest enterovirus concentration was observed on 10 25 2021 at charlotte 1 noroviruses are one of the most significant gastroenteritis causing viral agents considered to be a leading cause of food borne and waterborne disease outbreaks kukkula et al 1999 maunula et al 2008 noroviruses have been commonly investigated and widely detected in wastewater cashdollar et al 2013 katayama et al 2008 the highest concentration of norovirus was observed at rtp2 on 12 22 2021 bacterial pathogen signals stx2 campylobacter and salmonella were also prevalent in untreated wastewater table 2 the observed concentrations agreed with previous studies diemert and yan 2020 ginn et al 2021 yan et al 2018 shiga toxin genes stx2 are involved in the pathogenicity of some enteric bacteria such as e coli o157 h7 o104 h4 and shigella dysenteriae mclellan et al 2007 spears et al 2006 the highest stx2 concentration was observed on 8 9 2021 at charlotte2 campylobacter spp are gram negative bacteria that can cause gastroenteritis and may lead to guillain barré syndrome as well as reactive arthritis and irritable bowel syndrome farhadkhani et al 2020 the highest campylobacter concentration was observed on 1 24 2022 at charlotte1 salmonella enterica consists of a diverse group of serotypes that are ubiquitous in nature and is a common cause of human salmonellosis which leads to considerable morbidity and mortality hoorfar et al 2000 the highest concentration of salmonella was observed on 11 10 2021 at rtp2 wastewater monitoring of enteric pathogens could provide a snapshot of the community s health status chen et al 2014 o brien et al 2017 enteric infections are highly contagious and enteric viruses require low infectious doses to cause infection yezli and otter 2011 globally viruses have been found as the most abundant and hazardous pathogens in wastewater and viruses have been identified to cause more outbreaks than bacteria adegoke et al 2018 eftim et al 2017 xagoraraki and o brien 2020 in this study the detection rates and concentrations of viral and bacterial pathogens were high as measured by qpcr table 2 more specifically human adenoviruses were one or more magnitudes higher than stx2 campylobacter and salmonella in the same wwtp enterovirus and norovirus were also detected in high concentrations fig s1 this patten indicates that viral loads could be more prevalent than bacterial loads as causes for enteric diseases in the studied area a number of factors may influence the difference between the observed viral and bacterial loads including number of infected individuals within the community differences in the fate and transport of each target and differences in the shedding loads of bacteria and viruses brouwer et al 2022 gopinath et al 2012 mukhopadhya et al 2013 the variations in target amplicon genomic copies per organisms could also alter the prevalence of the pathogen detection viruses and bacteria have different mechanisms of genome replications and the number of target amplicons does not always equate the number of organisms bernabeu et al 2019 challberg and kelly 1989 reyes lamothe et al 2012 3 2 correlations between crassphage viral and bacterial pathogens concentrations of crassphage in untreated wastewater samples were approximately two to four magnitudes higher than concentrations of enteric pathogens fig 3 significant correlations were observed between crassphage and enteric viruses p 0 0001 spearman s rank correlations were 0 51 0 24 and 0 44 between crassphage and human adenovirus enterovirus and norovirus respectively table 3 similar correlation patterns between crassphage and human enteric viral pathogens were reported in a study conducted in river water and estuarine environments in u k farkas et al 2019 however our paper studied enterovirus and bacteria pathogens as well a strong significant positive correlation was also noted between human adenovirus and norovirus rho 0 57 enterovirus rho 0 41 and salmonella rho 0 54 as well as between norovirus enterovirus and salmonella table 3 enteric bacteria were also positively associated with crassphage as determined by spearman correlation analysis table 3 the correlation of enteric viruses and enteric bacteria has been studied in clinical samples via metagenomic approach for example gao et al 2021 conducted a gut microbiome analysis with clinical samples and showed that gut bacteria were negatively associated with viruses in colorectal cancer patients and health control groups gao et al 2021 in this study crassphage and bacterial pathogens in wastewater were measured in the same sample by qpcr which offers a quantitative approach that metagenomic analysis does not offer identifying an organism that can be used as an indicator for both bacterial and viral contaminants is a cost effective approach for monitoring efforts saving both time and resources the samples in this study were collected from municipal wwtps which provided a comprehensive view of the pathogen dynamics of the serviced community rather than from individual clinical patients further studies are needed to validate the crassphage marker as an effective indicator for bacterial pathogens using various types of environmental samples such as wastewater impacted surface waters and groundwater crassphage did not show significant correlation with stx2 p 0 77 since stx2 is a toxic gene it could be present in a variety of hosts i e e coli shigella and coliphages and thus will have different fate and transport pathways in comparison to individual bacterial pathogens garcia aljaro et al 2004 3 3 temporal variation of crassphage and enteric pathogens in wastewater the majority of the acute gastroenteritis among adults and children are caused by viruses and bacteria and have a substantial impact on public health victoria et al 2009 the concentrations of human enteric pathogens in environmental water samples and clinical samples have been shown to have seasonal variation suggesting that infections resulting from enteric etiologic agents are more prevalent at certain times of the year hata et al 2021 li et al 2011 thwiny et al 2022 in this study crassphage human adenovirus enterovirus norovirus stx2 campylobacter and salmonella showed strong seasonal variation p 0 01 and significant differences among seasons depending on the targets table 4 concentrations of crassphage in wastewater during the fall and winter months were significantly higher than those during the spring and summer months p 0 05 this contrasts with a fecal indicator evaluation study from river and estuarine water in the u k that showed crassphage had no distinct seasonal pattern farkas et al 2019 the difference between the two studies might be due to differences between the climate zones and sampling schedule frequency north carolina is in a subtropical climate zone while uk is in a temperate climate zone the uk study sampled once per month which was less intensive compared to the sampling frequency conducted in this study once per week or every other week which provided us with higher temporal resolution a study conducted in japan found that norovirus concentrations in wastewater were highest during the months of november to april while enterovirus and adenovirus concentrations were largely consistent throughout the year katayama et al 2008 a 9 year study in source water for potable use and untreated and treated wastewater in milwaukee wisconsin found that enteroviruses and adenoviruses were highest during the months of july to december sedmak et al 2005 in our study viral pathogens and bacterial pathogens in untreated wastewater showed strong seasonality table 4 with peak concentrations of human adenovirus in fall and winter while enterovirus and norovirus were highest in fall winter and spring campylobacter in winter and salmonella in fall shiga toxin gene stx2 increased during the warmer seasons with peak concentrations during summer table 4 elevated concentrations in human adenovirus enterovirus norovirus and salmonella were observed at the onset of the fall season lower temperatures and beginning of the school season in the fall may have an influence on the pathogen concentration dynamics and need to be further investigated a better characterization of parameters associated with human social behaviors and transmission routes might help explain the seasonality of these pathogens in addition environmental factors such as predation temperature turbidity in various built and natural environments may also impact the seasonal variation observed in these pathogens jagai et al 2017 sommerfeld and kroeger 2012 the high prevalence and concentration of stx2 gene identified in our samples suggest that shiga toxin producing organisms e g enterohemorrhagic e coli shigella aeromonas etc could be associated with a higher risk of gastroenteritis disease during the summer garcía aljaro et al 2006 2009 climate change is leading to more extreme weather events that in turn may trigger a higher frequency of combined sewage overflows cso and sanitary sewage overflows sso as a result climate change may be considered a driver for deteriorating water quality along with the effects of increased global temperatures which have been found to produce a shift in virulence and die off rates of viral and bacterial pathogens hutchins et al 2019 the pathogen seasonality identified in our samples is important for beach and recreational water quality monitoring programs and it can be particularly useful at locations that could be at risk of contamination by wastewater inputs due to extreme weather events such as tropical beaches awareness of significantly higher seasonal concentrations of enteric pathogen markers can inform water quality monitoring programs to ensure a safe recreational water environment for the public the information from our study may assist water managers with making evidence based decision to control risk associated with microbial contamination and minimize incidence of human waterborne diseases based on seasonal trends our findings can also advise health care workers to adjust precautions and preventative measurements throughout the year for viral and bacterial infections the nmds analysis showed that wastewater samples cluster together based on seasons fig 4 the nmds analysis offers a map that spatially conveys the relationships between the collected wastewater samples in a reduced two dimensional space with objective insights into the samples dissimilarity in this study pathogen assays human adenovirus enterovirus norovirus stx2 campylobacter salmonella are used as variants and the bray curtis distance between the samples are calculated the stress level is 0 155 from the nmds test which indicates that two dimensions are appropriate for the pathogen dataset results show overlapping pathogen communities during fall and winter with spring and summer samples starting to separate and summer and fall samples distinctly separating from each other this finding illustrates how seasonal changes alter the dynamics and drive transitions in the community of enteric pathogens thus offering beach managers and public health officers with decision support regarding the modification or implementation of advisories when surface waters become contaminated with untreated wastewater 3 4 spatial variation of crassphage and enteric pathogens in wastewater there was no significant difference in crassphage marker concentrations among the four wwtps in north carolina p 0 084 even though the service population and daily flowrates in the two wwtps in charlotte are larger than at the rtp ones table 1 also data collected did not show significant difference among the four wwtps for human adenovirus enterovirus norovirus salmonella and campylobacter table 4 although the rdchma has been developing rapidly in the past decades the city of charlotte is more urbanized and industrialized our results indicate that the differences in wwtp size daily flowrate and level of urbanization did not influence the abundance and prevalence of crassphage and did not produce significant spatial variability among markers similarly a study that screened a public human gut metagenomic database found that crassphage was similarly associated with industrialized and rural lifestyles and there was no strong biogeographic diversity within global crassphage strains honap et al 2020 our results suggest that untreated wastewater shares common microbial components across regional locations i e statewide and water quality data retrieved from one wastewater treatment plant can be applied to another wastewater treatment plant because the size of the studied wwtps and service population in this study are relatively similar table 1 a study including a higher geographic diversity with different climate zones and a larger range of wwtp service populations would be essential to offer a more comprehensive spatial assessment shiga toxin gene stx2 concentrations were the only ones that showed a significant difference among wwtps p 0 027 with p values of 0 003 for rtp2 and charlotte2 and 0 005 for rtp2 and charlotte1 from the post hoc tukey test the spatial differences among plants could be because the stx2 gene can be present in a variety of pathogens sources such as e coli o157 h7 o104 h4 and shigella dysenteriae mclellan et al 2007 spears et al 2006 the multi host feature of stx2 may result in different fate and transport pathways and a larger concentration range compared to other pathogens in the sewer system 3 5 correlations between microbial targets and influent flowrates we found that wwtp influent flowrates had significant correlations with human adenovirus p 0 0128 wastewater influent flowrate is one of the key components to characterize the dynamic of pollutant transport in urban sewersheds ogidan and giacomoni 2015 sansalone and buchberger 1997 hydrological conditions such as flowrates have been heavily investigated in stormwater monitoring systems wu et al 2018 and they could be useful in wastewater flow driven systems to explain trends and relationships and to interpret and normalize the levels of diverse pathogens in wastewater for example concentration levels of pathogens may increase because the flow brings higher viral and bacterial loads in contrast the concentrations may decrease due to the dilution created by a higher flow during hydraulic transport goettle and krauth 1981 the correlation coefficient between flowrate and human adenovirus was 0 21 table 3 the negative correlation indicates a dilution in the source of human adenovirus meaning that there are not enough viral particles available in the sewershed to maintain the same concentration when the water in the system increases e g morning and evening domestic rush hour usage during the sampling period the limitation of this flow and transport analysis is that we did not capture the tail end of the occurrence because our study was designed to capture only 24hr composited samples establishment of a regular and long term monitoring program with more frequent sampling periods would be helpful to capture the fate and transport of pathogens in the built environment and understand better environmental impacts e g stormwater breaches in the sanitary system or disease outbreaks in the population 4 conclusions this study presents evidence for the presence of crassphage in untreated wastewater samples in an understudied region of us the humid subtropical climate region north carolina usa we found crassphage concentrations two to four orders of magnitude higher than other microbial contaminants supporting the application of crassphage as a microbial water quality indicator crassphage and microbial pathogen concentrations displayed distinct seasonal patterns in untreated wastewater samples but no distinct spatial patterns fall winter and spring had significantly higher pathogen concentrations than summer p 0 05 regardless of the variability identified crassphage had significant correlations with human adenovirus enterovirus norovirus campylobacter and salmonella demonstrating that crassphage could be a water quality indicator for surface waters contaminated with untreated wastewater across seasons stx2 did not show correlations with crassphage which requires further investigation of other fecal indicators for the monitoring of outbreaks associated with stx2 and underlines one of the possible limitations of crassphage as a water quality indicator of broad application the findings of this research can provide baseline information for the development of new approaches for bacterial and viral pathogen monitoring efforts quantitative microbial risk assessment and strategies for pathogen removal during treatment processes these results can also inform microbial modeling efforts and enhance prediction of the impact of wastewater pathogens on

14758,enteric disease remains one of the most common concerns for public health particularly when it results from human exposure to surface and recreational waters contaminated with wastewater characterizing the temporal and spatial variation of enteric pathogens prevalent in wastewater is critical to develop approaches to mitigate their distribution in the environment in this study we aim to characterize pathogen variability and test the applicability of the human associated wastewater indicator crassphage as an indicator of enteric viral and bacterial pathogens we conducted weekly samplings for 14 months from four wastewater treatment plants in north carolina usa untreated wastewater samples were processed using hollow fiber ultrafiltration followed by secondary concentration methods adenovirus norovirus enterovirus salmonella shiga toxin 2 stx2 campylobacter and crassphage were measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr and reverse transcriptase rt qpcr our results revealed significant correlations between crassphage and human adenovirus enterovirus norovirus salmonella and campylobacter p 0 01 pathogens and crassphage concentrations in untreated wastewater showed distinct seasonal patterns with peak concentrations of crassphage and viral pathogens in fall and winter while bacterial pathogens showed peaked concentrations in either winter campylobacter fall salmonella or summer stx2 this study enhances the understanding of crassphage as an alternative molecular indicator for both bacterial and viral pathogens the findings of this study can also inform microbial modeling efforts for the prediction of the impact of wastewater pathogens on surface waters due to increased flooding events and wastewater overflows associated with climate

bacteria and viruses qpcr rt qpcr data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction waterborne and foodborne enteric disease outbreaks can lead to hospitalization death beach and school closures and economic burdens buzby and roberts 2009 enteric pathogens such as noroviruses rotaviruses salmonella pathogenic escherichia coli and cryptosporidium remain one of the public health concerns following exposure to contaminated waters the latest u s environmental protection agency epa contaminant candidate list ccl4 contained 12 microbial contaminants including human adenoviruses enteroviruses noroviruses salmonella enterica campylobacter jejuni e coli o157 and shigella sonnei one of the challenges to detect enteric pathogens in environmental water samples is their low ambient concentrations thus direct detection without multi step sample processing may not be possible mccall et al 2020 traditionally culturable methods for fecal indicator fecal coliforms e coli enterococci and coliphages have been used for water quality assessment epa 2009a b 2018 two drawbacks of these cultivation based procedures are that most require 18 h or more to produce results and cannot track sources of fecal contamination making it challenging to inform water safety managers on the same day advances in molecular methods particularly pcr based methods offer an attractive alternative for improved and rapid detection of a diverse group of microbial targets in water gene markers assays including us epa method 1609 1 for enterococci epa method 1696 for the human fecal marker hf183 and coliphages phix174 and ms2 assays have been applied in water remediation programs and provide rapid same day water quality notification epa 2019 seurinck et al 2005 turgeon et al 2014 however an ideal pathogen and fecal indicator should be present in high concentration in source water and correlate with both viral and bacterial etiologic agents that cause enteric diseases recently crassphage cross assembly bacteriophage has been proposed as a human associated marker for monitoring fecal contamination of surface water lake water stormwater and wastewater treatments ahmed et al 2018b bibby and peccia 2013 crank et al 2019 farkas et al 2019 stachler et al 2014 detected crassphage in high abundance in the human gut by metagenomic analysis and later found it is highly associated with human fecal contamination stachler and bibby 2014 stachler et al 2017 however the correlations between the crassphage marker and enteric pathogens in wastewater remain to be defined across geographic locations and seasons studies have demonstrated that enteric diseases e g gastroenteritis exhibit seasonal patterns in the communities with higher number of cases during winter and spring o brien and xagoraraki 2019 thwiny et al 2022 however the leading and dominant enteric pathogen in different seasons and the spatial variability i e different treatment plants have not been fully clarified the objectives of this study were to 1 assess effectiveness of the emerging wastewater crassphage marker as a microbial water quality indicator for both enteric viral and bacterial pathogens and 2 identify the dynamics of the enteric pathogens throughout the seasons by characterizing the temporal and spatial variation of viral and bacterial pathogens in untreated wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater sampling composited untreated wastewater samples 24 h flow weighted were collected biweekly from two wastewater treatment plants wwtps located in the raleigh durham chapel hill metropolitan area rdcma nc rtp1 and rtp2 in addition weekly samples were collected from two wwtps located in charlotte charlotte1 and charlotte2 nc fig 1 five litres wastewater samples were processed in the first two months of the sampling events and three litres of wastewater samples were processed for the rest of the sampling period due to the high turbidity of the samples samples were collected in sterile 1 l nalgene bottles at each site following collection the wastewater samples were transported to the laboratory in coolers packed with ice deionized water in a 1 l nalgene sample collection bottle was used as field blanks the collected samples were processed for primary concentration within 24 h after arriving at the laboratory samples from rtp1 and rtp2 were processed for primary concentration at the environmental protection agency epa laboratory in research triangle park while samples from charlotte1 and charlotte2 were processed at the university of north carolina charlotte environmental water laboratory all secondary concentrations were performed at the epa lab a total of 147 raw wastewater samples were collected during 73 sampling events in 14 months january 2021 to february 2022 charlotte1 and rtp1 were sampled from january 2021 to february 2022 sampling events for charlotte2 were conducted from june 2021 to february 2022 sampling events for rtp 2 were conducted from february 2021 to february 2022 the characteristics of each wwtp are shown in table 1 2 2 sample processing and concentrating due to the covid 19 pandemic wastewater samples have the potential of containing infectious sars cov 2 virus and therefore samples were processed in an enhanced biosafety laboratory level 2 enhanced bsl 2 room as per cdc guidance cdc 2020 sample processing workflow for bacteria and viruses is shown in fig 2 wastewater samples were processed using a dead end hollow fiber ultrafiltration d hfuf procedure followed by secondary concentration as described below wastewater 3 l to 5 l was filtered through the dead end hollow fiber ultrafilter rexeed 15s dial medical supply chester springs pa using a peristaltic pump masterflex l s easy load cole parmer vernon hills il usa set at 300 rpm the rexeed 15s filter was stabilized by a ring stand with utility clamp and the filters were eluted by passing 200 ml of elution solution to obtain the first eluate mcminn et al 2021 the sample and filtration information were recorded on a chain of custody record form for bacterial pathogen analysis 20 ml of the first eluate was filtered through a 0 45 mm filter hawp04700 millipore bedford ma in duplicate fig 2 after filtration the filter was transferred to the extraction tubes containing 0 1 mm glass beads provided in the qiagen powerlyzer powersoil extraction kit qiagen valencia ca usa and saved at 80 c for enteric virus analysis the rest of the first eluate approximately 160 ml was further processed using a beef extract and celite method modified from epa method 1615 cashdollar et al 2013 mcminn et al 2012 briefly 1 5 w v beef extract powder was added to the eluate while slowly stirring on a stir plate in the meantime 0 1 g per 100 ml celite and 1 n hcl dropwise were added into the concentrate and stabilized for 10 min to reach a pellet to 4 0 to bind virus particles via organic flocculation the first eluate was then centrifuged at 3800 x g for 10 min and pellet was saved the pellet was resuspended in 8 ml of phosphate buffered saline pbs at a ph of 9 to 9 5 and centrifuged again at 6000 x g for 15 mins to release the virus into the liquid phase the supernatant secondary eluate was saved into 500 ml aliquots and preserved at 80 c for nucleic acid extraction after filtration through a 0 2 µm filter processed samples were analyzed for molecular assays within six months of sample collection 2 3 nucleic acid extraction and analysis for enteric viruses dna and rna were extracted from 200 μl secondary eluate using qiagen all prep powerviral kit qiagen valencia ca usa for bacteria dna was extracted using the qiagen powerlyzer powersoil kit qiagen valencia ca usa the extractions followed manufacturer s instructions with an additional ethanol wash before nucleic acid elution to alleviate pcr inhibition each sample was extracted in duplicate with a reagent blank molecular grade water in each extraction batch the final elution volume for each extraction was 100 μl which was then divided into 30 μl aliquots and stored at 80 c 2 4 detection and quantification using qpcr and rt qpcr for human adenoviruses and bacterial pathogen targets stx2 campylobacter and salmonella extracted dna samples were diluted five fold and quantified by qpcr enterovirus and norovirus were quantified using a two step rt qpcr detailed method descriptions are included in the supplementary material a five point standard curve ranging from 104 to 3 gene copy gc reaction was included with samples in each reaction plate for each pathogen assay idt gblocks were used for standard curves and positive controls idt coralville ia usa for crassphage the standard curve ranged from 107 to 103 gc reaction due to its abundance in untreated wastewater the assays efficiencies were 90 110 and linearities r squared values were above 0 98 based on standard curves detection limit was three copies per reaction or 1000 gc l lower measurement limit inhibition of the samples was determined by performing hf183 internal amplification control iac multiplex assay as described in epa method 1696 the inhibition of the samples was evaluated by comparing the iac threshold as previously described epa 2019 three no template controls ntcs using molecular grade water were included with each instrument run untreated wastewater has high organic content and it often leads to inhibition in qpcr analysis uchii et al 2019 we found inhibition in all the undiluted samples therefore after performing a range of dilutions in the extracted samples a fivefold dilution was determined to provide the best balance between the detection of the target and dilution of the inhibition 2 5 statistical analyses all statistics were computed using rstudio version 2022 2 0 443 qpcr data was log10 transformed and its normality was tested by the qq plot function the microbial targets were grouped into four different seasons spring march to may 2021 summer june to august 2021 fall september to november 2021 and winter december 2021 to february 2022 for spatial variation samples were grouped into four different sites rtp1 rtp2 charlotte1 charlotte2 a one way analysis of variance anova was used to investigate significance between mean concentrations of select pathogens in wastewater samples tukey s honestly significant difference test tukey s hsd was used to find means that are significantly different from each other for seasonal and spatial variation comparisons correlation structure between the wastewater indicator crassphage and enteric pathogens pair by pair was evaluated using spearman r coefficient as a non parametric measure for its robustness toward influential data points and outliers singh et al 2004 with p value cutoffs of 0 05 finally for measurements reported as non detects or below the lower measurement limit the non detected nd designation was substituted with half of the square root of the detection limit 15 8 gc l non metric multidimensional scaling nmds analysis was performed on analytical composites of the enteric pathogen assays human adenovirus enterovirus norovirus stx2 salmonella campylobacter a confidence interval of 0 7 was used to delineate data ellipses 3 results and discussion the objectives of this study were to characterize the temporal and spatial dynamics of enteric pathogens in untreated wastewater in north carolina and to evaluate the correlations between crassphage and enteric pathogens in wastewater throughout different seasons no template controls were negative in each assay suggesting no cross contamination the limit of detection lod was 3 gene copies gc reaction for pathogen assays and samples below this concentration were considered non detects since crassphage was always detected in high abundance lod was not applied to crassphage 3 1 concentrations and prevalence of crassphage and enteric pathogens the sampling sites in north carolina are in the humid sub tropical climate zone with very warm summers and moderately cold winters we collected 24 h composite samples based on previous studies virus abundance in composite samples is more representative of viral concentrations than grab samples ahmed et al 2021 all untreated wastewater samples were positive for the crassphage marker table 2 fig 3 we observed the lowest crassphage concentrations at charlotte1 on 5 5 2021 and the highest concentration at charlotte2 on 8 9 2021 tables 1 and 2 the crassphage concentrations reported in our study 107 1010 gc l in untreated wastewater aligns with concentrations reported by others including studies in florida italy and japan ahmed et al 2018a crank et al 2020 malla et al 2019 high abundance of crassphage marker in untreated wastewater suggests that crassphage could serve as an indicator for wastewater contamination in subtropical climate regions sabar et al 2022 the concentrations of viral and bacterial pathogen targets in wastewater are shown in table 2 and enteric viruses showed high detection frequency above 85 the observed concentrations agreed with previous studies mccall et al 2021 o brien et

was observed on 8 9 2021 at charlotte 2 enterovirus can cause an array of afflictions depending on the virus type including viral sinusitis common cold meningitis and poliomyelitis and have been linked to outbreaks of these diseases maunula et al 2008 the highest enterovirus concentration was observed on 10 25 2021 at charlotte 1 noroviruses are one of the most significant gastroenteritis causing viral agents considered to be a leading cause of food borne and waterborne disease outbreaks kukkula et al 1999 maunula et al 2008 noroviruses have been commonly investigated and widely detected in wastewater cashdollar et al 2013 katayama et al 2008 the highest concentration of norovirus was observed at rtp2 on 12 22 2021 bacterial pathogen signals stx2 campylobacter and salmonella were also prevalent in untreated wastewater table 2 the observed concentrations agreed with previous studies diemert and yan 2020 ginn et al 2021 yan et al 2018 shiga toxin genes stx2 are involved in the pathogenicity of some enteric bacteria such as e coli o157 h7 o104 h4 and shigella dysenteriae mclellan et al 2007 spears et al 2006 the highest stx2 concentration was observed on 8 9 2021 at charlotte2 campylobacter spp are gram negative bacteria that can cause gastroenteritis and may lead to guillain barré syndrome as well as reactive arthritis and irritable bowel syndrome farhadkhani et al 2020 the highest campylobacter concentration was observed on 1 24 2022 at charlotte1 salmonella enterica consists of a diverse group of serotypes that are ubiquitous in nature and is a common cause of human salmonellosis which leads to considerable morbidity and mortality hoorfar et al 2000 the highest concentration of salmonella was observed on 11 10 2021 at rtp2 wastewater monitoring of enteric pathogens could provide a snapshot of the community s health status chen et al 2014 o brien et al 2017 enteric infections are highly contagious and enteric viruses require low infectious doses to cause infection yezli and otter 2011 globally viruses have been found as the most abundant and hazardous pathogens in wastewater and viruses have been identified to cause more outbreaks than bacteria adegoke et al 2018 eftim et al 2017 xagoraraki and o brien 2020 in this study the detection rates and concentrations of viral and bacterial pathogens were high as measured by qpcr table 2 more specifically human adenoviruses were one or more magnitudes higher than stx2 campylobacter and salmonella in the same wwtp enterovirus and norovirus were also detected in high concentrations fig s1 this patten indicates that viral loads could be more prevalent than bacterial loads as causes for enteric diseases in the studied area a number of factors may influence the difference between the observed viral and bacterial loads including number of infected individuals within the community differences in the fate and transport of each target and differences in the shedding loads of bacteria and viruses brouwer et al 2022 gopinath et al 2012 mukhopadhya et al 2013 the variations in target amplicon genomic copies per organisms could also alter the prevalence of the pathogen detection viruses and bacteria have different mechanisms of genome replications and the number of target amplicons does not always equate the number of organisms bernabeu et al 2019 challberg and kelly 1989 reyes lamothe et al 2012 3 2 correlations between crassphage viral and bacterial pathogens concentrations of crassphage in untreated wastewater samples were approximately two to four magnitudes higher than concentrations of enteric pathogens fig 3 significant correlations were observed between crassphage and enteric viruses p 0 0001 spearman s rank correlations were 0 51 0 24 and 0 44 between crassphage and human adenovirus enterovirus and norovirus respectively table 3 similar correlation patterns between crassphage and human enteric viral pathogens were reported in a study conducted in river water and estuarine environments in u k farkas et al 2019 however our paper studied enterovirus and bacteria pathogens as well a strong significant positive correlation was also noted between human adenovirus and norovirus rho 0 57 enterovirus rho 0 41 and salmonella rho 0 54 as well as between norovirus enterovirus and salmonella table 3 enteric bacteria were also positively associated with crassphage as determined by spearman correlation analysis table 3 the correlation of enteric viruses and enteric bacteria has been studied in clinical samples via metagenomic approach for example gao et al 2021 conducted a gut microbiome analysis with clinical samples and showed that gut bacteria were negatively associated with viruses in colorectal cancer patients and health control groups gao et al 2021 in this study crassphage and bacterial pathogens in wastewater were measured in the same sample by qpcr which offers a quantitative approach that metagenomic analysis does not offer identifying an organism that can be used as an indicator for both bacterial and viral contaminants is a cost effective approach for monitoring efforts saving both time and resources the samples in this study were collected from municipal wwtps which provided a comprehensive view of the pathogen dynamics of the serviced community rather than from individual clinical patients further studies are needed to validate the crassphage marker as an effective indicator for bacterial pathogens using various types of environmental samples such as wastewater impacted surface waters and groundwater crassphage did not show significant correlation with stx2 p 0 77 since stx2 is a toxic gene it could be present in a variety of hosts i e e coli shigella and coliphages and thus will have different fate and transport pathways in comparison to individual bacterial pathogens garcia aljaro et al 2004 3 3 temporal variation of crassphage and enteric pathogens in wastewater the majority of the acute gastroenteritis among adults and children are caused by viruses and bacteria and have a substantial impact on public health victoria et al 2009 the concentrations of human enteric pathogens in environmental water samples and clinical samples have been shown to have seasonal variation suggesting that infections resulting from enteric etiologic agents are more prevalent at certain times of the year hata et al 2021 li et al 2011 thwiny et al 2022 in this study crassphage human adenovirus enterovirus norovirus stx2 campylobacter and salmonella showed strong seasonal variation p 0 01 and significant differences among seasons depending on the targets table 4 concentrations of crassphage in wastewater during the fall and winter months were significantly higher than those during the spring and summer months p 0 05 this contrasts with a fecal indicator evaluation study from river and estuarine water in the u k that showed crassphage had no distinct seasonal pattern farkas et al 2019 the difference between the two studies might be due to differences between the climate zones and sampling schedule frequency north carolina is in a subtropical climate zone while uk is in a temperate climate zone the uk study sampled once per month which was less intensive compared to the sampling frequency conducted in this study once per week or every other week which provided us with higher temporal resolution a study conducted in japan found that norovirus concentrations in wastewater were highest during the months of november to april while enterovirus and adenovirus concentrations were largely consistent throughout the year katayama et al 2008 a 9 year study in source water for potable use and untreated and treated wastewater in milwaukee wisconsin found that enteroviruses and adenoviruses were highest during the months of july to december sedmak et al 2005 in our study viral pathogens and bacterial pathogens in untreated wastewater showed strong seasonality table 4 with peak concentrations of human adenovirus in fall and winter while enterovirus and norovirus were highest in fall winter and spring campylobacter in winter and salmonella in fall shiga toxin gene stx2 increased during the warmer seasons with peak concentrations during summer table 4 elevated concentrations in human adenovirus enterovirus norovirus and salmonella were observed at the onset of the fall season lower temperatures and beginning of the school season in the fall may have an influence on the pathogen concentration dynamics and need to be further investigated a better characterization of parameters associated with human social behaviors and transmission routes might help explain the seasonality of these pathogens in addition environmental factors such as predation temperature turbidity in various built and natural environments may also impact the seasonal variation observed in these pathogens jagai et al 2017 sommerfeld and kroeger 2012 the high prevalence and concentration of stx2 gene identified in our samples suggest that shiga toxin producing organisms e g enterohemorrhagic e coli shigella aeromonas etc could be associated with a higher risk of gastroenteritis disease during the summer garcía aljaro et al 2006 2009 climate change is leading to more extreme weather events that in turn may trigger a higher frequency of combined sewage overflows cso and sanitary sewage overflows sso as a result climate change may be considered a driver for deteriorating water quality along with the effects of increased global temperatures which have been found to produce a shift in virulence and die off rates of viral and bacterial pathogens hutchins et al 2019 the pathogen seasonality identified in our samples is important for beach and recreational water quality monitoring programs and it can be particularly useful at locations that could be at risk of contamination by wastewater inputs due to extreme weather events such as tropical beaches awareness of significantly higher seasonal concentrations of enteric pathogen markers can inform water quality monitoring programs to ensure a safe recreational water environment for the public the information from our study may assist water managers with making evidence based decision to control risk associated with microbial contamination and minimize incidence of human waterborne diseases based on seasonal trends our findings can also advise health care workers to adjust precautions and preventative measurements throughout the year for viral and bacterial infections the nmds analysis showed that wastewater samples cluster together based on seasons fig 4 the nmds analysis offers a map that spatially conveys the relationships between the collected wastewater samples in a reduced two dimensional space with objective insights into the samples dissimilarity in this study pathogen assays human adenovirus enterovirus norovirus stx2 campylobacter salmonella are used as variants and the bray curtis distance between the samples are calculated the stress level is 0 155 from the nmds test which indicates that two dimensions are appropriate for the pathogen dataset results show overlapping pathogen communities during fall and winter with spring and summer samples starting to separate and summer and fall samples distinctly separating from each other this finding illustrates how seasonal changes alter the dynamics and drive transitions in the community of enteric pathogens thus offering beach managers and public health officers with decision support regarding the modification or implementation of advisories when surface waters become contaminated with untreated wastewater 3 4 spatial variation of crassphage and enteric pathogens in wastewater there was no significant difference in crassphage marker concentrations among the four wwtps in north carolina p 0 084 even though the service population and daily flowrates in the two wwtps in charlotte are larger than at the rtp ones table 1 also data collected did not show significant difference among the four wwtps for human adenovirus enterovirus norovirus salmonella and campylobacter table 4 although the rdchma has been developing rapidly in the past decades the city of charlotte is more urbanized and industrialized our results indicate that the differences in wwtp size daily flowrate and level of urbanization did not influence the abundance and prevalence of crassphage and did not produce significant spatial variability among markers similarly a study that screened a public human gut metagenomic database found that crassphage was similarly associated with industrialized and rural lifestyles and there was no strong biogeographic diversity within global crassphage strains honap et al 2020 our results suggest that untreated wastewater shares common microbial components across regional locations i e statewide and water quality data retrieved from one wastewater treatment plant can be applied to another wastewater treatment plant because the size of the studied wwtps and service population in this study are relatively similar table 1 a study including a higher geographic diversity with different climate zones and a larger range of wwtp service populations would be essential to offer a more comprehensive spatial assessment shiga toxin gene stx2 concentrations were the only ones that showed a significant difference among wwtps p 0 027 with p values of 0 003 for rtp2 and charlotte2 and 0 005 for rtp2 and charlotte1 from the post hoc tukey test the spatial differences among plants could be because the stx2 gene can be present in a variety of pathogens sources such as e coli o157 h7 o104 h4 and shigella dysenteriae mclellan et al 2007 spears et al 2006 the multi host feature of stx2 may result in different fate and transport pathways and a larger concentration range compared to other pathogens in the sewer system 3 5 correlations between microbial targets and influent flowrates we found that wwtp influent flowrates had significant correlations with human adenovirus p 0 0128 wastewater influent flowrate is one of the key components to characterize the dynamic of pollutant transport in urban sewersheds ogidan and giacomoni 2015 sansalone and buchberger 1997 hydrological conditions such as flowrates have been heavily investigated in stormwater monitoring systems wu et al 2018 and they could be useful in wastewater flow driven systems to explain trends and relationships and to interpret and normalize the levels of diverse pathogens in wastewater for example concentration levels of pathogens may increase because the flow brings higher viral and bacterial loads in contrast the concentrations may decrease due to the dilution created by a higher flow during hydraulic transport goettle and krauth 1981 the correlation coefficient between flowrate and human adenovirus was 0 21 table 3 the negative correlation indicates a dilution in the source of human adenovirus meaning that there are not enough viral particles available in the sewershed to maintain the same concentration when the water in the system increases e g morning and evening domestic rush hour usage during the sampling period the limitation of this flow and transport analysis is that we did not capture the tail end of the occurrence because our study was designed to capture only 24hr composited samples establishment of a regular and long term monitoring program with more frequent sampling periods would be helpful to capture the fate and transport of pathogens in the built environment and understand better environmental impacts e g stormwater breaches in the sanitary system or disease outbreaks in the population 4 conclusions this study presents evidence for the presence of crassphage in untreated wastewater samples in an understudied region of us the humid subtropical climate region north carolina usa we found crassphage concentrations two to four orders of magnitude higher than other microbial contaminants supporting the application of crassphage as a microbial water quality indicator crassphage and microbial pathogen concentrations displayed distinct seasonal patterns in untreated wastewater samples but no distinct spatial patterns fall winter and spring had significantly higher pathogen concentrations than summer p 0 05 regardless of the variability identified crassphage had significant correlations with human adenovirus enterovirus norovirus campylobacter and salmonella demonstrating that crassphage could be a water quality indicator for surface waters contaminated with untreated wastewater across seasons stx2 did not show correlations with crassphage which requires further investigation of other fecal indicators for the monitoring of outbreaks associated with stx2 and underlines one of the possible limitations of crassphage as a water quality indicator of broad application the findings of this research can provide baseline information for the development of new approaches for bacterial and viral pathogen monitoring efforts quantitative microbial risk assessment and strategies for pathogen removal during treatment processes these results can also inform microbial modeling efforts and enhance prediction of the impact of wastewater pathogens on

14759,plastic pollution caused by conventional plastics has promoted the development and use of biodegradable plastics however biodegradable plastics do not degrade readily in water instead they can generate micro and nanoplastics compared to microplastics nanoplastics are more likely to cause negative impacts to the aquatic environment due to their smaller size the impacts of biodegradable nanoplastics highly depend on their aggregation behavior and colloidal stability which still remain unknown here we studied the aggregation kinetics of biodegradable nanoplastics made of polybutylene adipate co terephthalate pbat in nacl and cacl 2 solutions as well as in natural waters before and after weathering we further studied the effect of proteins on aggregation kinetics with both negative charged bovine serum albumin bsa and positive charged lysozyme lsz for pristine pbat nanoplastics before weathering ca2 destabilized nanoplastic suspensions more aggressively than na with the critical coagulation concentration being 20 mm in cacl 2 vs 325 mm in nacl both bsa and lsz promoted the aggregation of pristine pbat nanoplastics and lsz showed a more pronounced effect however no aggregation was observed for weathered pbat nanoplastics under most experimental conditions further stability tests demonstrated that pristine pbat nanoplastics aggregated substantially in seawater but not in freshwater and only slightly in soil pore water while weathered pbat nanoplastics remained stable in all natural waters these results suggest that biodegradable nanoplastics especially weathered biodegradable nanoplastics are highly stable in the aquatic environment even in the marine environment graphical abstract keywords biodegradable nanoplastics polybutylene adipate co terephthalate pbat aggregation protein weathering natural water data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction plastic has become a serious pollutant in the environment it was reported that approximately 8300 million metric tons of plastics were produced by 2017 and 4900 million metric tons were discarded in landfills or the natural environment geyer et al 2017 these discarded plastics threaten ecosystems not only by themselves but also by the generated micro and nanoplastics during breakdown large plastic pieces can entangle animals in land and in water leading to reduced mobility and starvation law 2017 ryan 2018 while micro and nanoplastics can be ingested and inhaled by animals causing decreased food uptake impeded growth and inflammation cole and galloway 2015 espinosa et al 2018 prata 2018 to alleviate these problems biodegradable plastics have been proposed to replace conventional plastics particularly for single use plastics unlike conventional plastics which are persistent and can reside in the environment for decades or even centuries nithin and goel 2017 biodegradable plastics can degrade completely in months or years when disposed of in appropriate environments narancic et al 2018 tosin et al 2019 sintim et al 2020 although biodegradable plastics can be metabolized by microorganisms and be converted into co 2 ch 4 and biomass haider et al 2019 flury and narayan 2021 they inevitably generate micro and nanoplastics during degradation gonzález pleiter et al 2019 sintim et al 2019 the generated micro and nanoplastics will unlikely pose an environmental threat if biodegradable plastic waste is appropriately managed and disposed of in industrial composting or anaerobic digestion facilities where full degradation of the plastics can be reached before the generated micro and nanoplastics are released to the environment kubowicz and booth 2017 yu et al 2021 however mismanagement or off site transport can happen leading to exposure of biodegradable plastics and thus to the release of micro and nanoplastics to the environment exposure of biodegradable plastics to the aquatic environment can be especially concerning as shown in previous studies biodegradable plastics made of polybutylene adipate co terephthalate pbat did not readily degrade in water wang et al 2019 instead they generated more microplastics than low density polyethylene plastics wei et al 2021 these generated biodegradable microplastics may persist and accumulate in the aquatic environment and further fragment into secondary nanoplastics secondary nanoplastics were indeed found to be released from biodegradable microplastics made of polyhydroxybutyrate when the microplastics were immersed in water and these nanoplastics further induced decrease in cellular growth and altered physiological parameters of freshwater cyanobacterium alga and crustacean gonzález pleiter et al 2019 this raises concerns about the impacts of secondary biodegradable nanoplastics in the aquatic environment the impacts of secondary nanoplastics on aquatic ecosystems depend on the nanoplastics aggregation behavior and colloidal stability aggregation and stability of nanoplastics have been intensively studied with model polystyrene nanoplastics liu et al 2019 wang et al 2020 li et al 2021b but only a few studies with other types of polymers exist shams et al 2020 these studies show that particle particle interactions are controlled by surface properties and solution chemistry surface properties of nanoplastics can be modified by weathering which increases the negative charge of nanoplastics and inhibits aggregation liu et al 2019 wang et al 2020 besides extracellular polymeric substances such as proteins can cover nanoplastics with a corona which can either hinder aggregation through imposing steric repulsion or promote aggregation through decreasing electrostatic interaction li et al 2021b however to the best of our knowledge no information is currently available about the effects of weathering and proteins on aggregation of biodegradable nanoplastics to fill this knowledge gap we studied the aggregation behavior of biodegradable nanoplastics generated from a pbat mulch film the pbat mulch film was chosen because pbat is the most commonly used polymer in biodegradable plastic mulch films which are intentionally introduced into the environment through soil incorporation the aggregation of pbat nanoplastics before and after weathering was examined in both nacl and cacl 2 solutions na ca2 and cl represent common ions in natural water the effect of proteins was studied with negative charged bovine serum albumin bsa and positive charged lysozyme lsz both bsa and lsz are abundant in natural waters and have been commonly used as model proteins to study the interaction between nanoplastics and proteins dong et al 2020 li et al 2021a b further we determined the stability of pbat nanoplastics in soil pore water freshwater and seawater to estimate the potential of biodegradable nanoplastics to migrate from land to oceans we hypothesized that 1 weathering stabilizes pbat nanoplastics 2 proteins promote the aggregation of pbat nanoplastics and 3 pbat nanoplastics are highly stable in natural waters 2 materials and methods 2 1 pristine and weathered pbat nanoplastics a biodegradable plastic mulch film made of polybutylene adipate co terephthalate pbat bioagri biobag americas dunedin fl was used to generate pbat nanoplastics the pbat mulch film was black with a thickness of 29 1 2 μ m and a density of 22 8 0 4 g m 2 further properties of the film are given in hayes et al 2017 briefly film pieces 12 cm 2 cm were cut off from a new roll of mulch film sequentially soaked in deionized water and liquid nitrogen and then blended milled sieved wet ground and air dried astner et al 2019 the resulting mulch powder 7 g was suspended in deionized water filtered through a 0 45 μ m membrane filter hawp04700 mf millipore milliporesigma burlington ma and then through a 0 22 μ m syringe filter slgp033rb millex gp merck millipore ltd ireland the filtrate was collected as the stock suspension of pristine pbat nanoplastics the stock suspension had a concentration of about 470 mg l based on gravimetric analysis the stock suspension of weathered pbat nanoplastics was prepared from uv weathered ground mulch powder an aliquot 7 g of the ground mulch powder was irradiated with a 1 kw xenon arc lamp wavelength 300 800 nm 650 w m 2 in an atlas suntest cps solar simulator atlas material testing technology llc mount prospect il for 336 h the 336 h exposure is equivalent to 66 days of european mean solar irradiance gewert et al 2018 which represents the sunlight exposure of biodegradable plastic mulch films during growing seasons the sample was placed into a pyrex glass beaker 200 ml and manually mixed every 24 h to ensure uniform weathering then the sample was suspended in deionized water and filtered sequentially through 0 45 μ m membrane filters and 0 22 μ m syringe filters to collect filtrate containing weathered pbat nanoplastics and the filtrate had a concentration of about 380 mg l gravimetrically determined 2 2 characterization of pristine and weathered pbat nanoplastics the morphology and size of pristine and weathered pbat nanoplastics were visualized with scanning electron microscopy sem fei apreo volumescope sem fei company hillsboro or briefly a suspension 150 mg l of either pristine or weathered pbat nanoplastics was sonicated for 10 min branson ultrasonicator b 52 50 60 hz 440 watts to break up any aggregates and disperse nanoplastics and a drop 5 μ l was deposited onto a sem stub air dried in vacuum for 20 min gold coated and imaged with sem the hydrodynamic diameters of pristine and weathered pbat nanoplastics in deionized water to obtain the intrinsic size were measured with a zetasizer nano zs malvern instruments ltd malvern uk to study the effect of ph the ζ potentials were measured in 10 mm nacl with the zetasizer over a wide range of ph 3 to 11 ph adjusted with 10 mm hcl or 10 mm naoh the effect of weathering was characterized with raman spectroscopy labram horiba kyoto japan the raman spectra of both pristine and weathered pbat mulch powder were collected using a 633 nm he ne laser with a 50 objective numerical aperture 0 75 2 3 determination of aggregation kinetics the aggregation kinetics of pristine and weathered pbat nanoplastics were measured with the zetasizer using the time resolved dynamic light scattering in nacl 10 mm to 1000 mm and cacl 2 2 mm to 50 mm solutions detailed experimental conditions are given in table s1 prior to the measurement the stock suspensions of pbat nanoplastics and the electrolyte solutions were adjusted to the same ph using 10 mm hcl or naoh for each measurement the stock suspension of pbat nanoplastics was sonicated for 10 min and then aliquots of the stock suspension deionized water and electrolyte solution were pipetted into a disposable plastic cuvette to achieve desired nanoplastic and electrolyte concentrations 150 mg l for both pristine and weathered pbat nanoplastics the concentration was chosen to ensure a good signal from the dynamic light scattering measurement the cuvette was briefly vortexed for 3 s and placed into the zetasizer and dynamic light scattering measurement in terms of hydrodynamic diameter d h was immediately carried out at 25 o c with the auto correlation function accumulated for 2 min and continued for 50 min to obtain aggregation profiles each measurement was conducted in duplicates the initial aggregation rate constant k of pbat nanoplastics was determined as the slope of the linear least squares regression of the aggregation profiles up to the point where d h t increased to 1 5 d h t 0 because k is proportional to the initial rate of increase in d h with time holthoff et al 1996 chen et al 2006 berg 2010 1 k 1 n 0 d d h t d t t 0 where n 0 is the initial nanoplastic concentration to quantify the aggregation kinetics the attachment efficiency α was calculated by normalizing the initial aggregation rate constant k by the initial aggregation rate constant under diffusion limited fast aggregation condition k fast chen et al 2006 berg 2010 2 α k k fast 1 n 0 d d h t d t t 0 1 n 0 fast d d h t d t t 0 fast where n 0 fast was equal to n 0 in the aggregation experiments the critical coagulation concentration ccc was then determined as the electrolyte concentration where the extrapolated linear regression line of α values in reaction limited regimes intersects with α 1 in diffusion limited regimes in logarithmic coordinates berg 2010 yang et al 2019 to study the effect of proteins suspensions of negative charged bovine serum albumin bsa molecular weight 66 5 kda isoelectric point is ph 4 7 a8806 milliporesigma burlington ma and positive charged lysozyme lsz molecular weight 14 3 kda isoelectric point is ph 11 l6876 milliporesigma burlington ma were prepared using deionized water with ph adjusted to the same value as the pbat nanoplastic suspensions and the electrolyte solutions after sonicating suspensions of pbat nanoplastics and proteins separately 10 min aliquots of pbat nanoplastics proteins and electrolyte were pipetted into a disposable plastic cuvette to achieve desired protein and electrolyte concentrations and dynamic light scattering measurements were carried out immediately after vortexing aggregation profiles of pristine and weathered pbat nanoplastics were obtained in the presence of a fixed concentration of proteins bsa or lsz 10 mg l in nacl and cacl 2 solutions in the presence of bsa a monotonic increase in k was found as the electrolyte concentration increases thus α was calculated in the same way as in the absence of proteins and ccc values with bsa were further determined while in the presence of lsz k generally decreased as the electrolyte concentration increased thus α was calculated with k fast being the initial aggregation rate constant of pbat nanoplastics at the lowest electrolyte concentration besides we obtained aggregation profiles of pristine and weathered pbat nanoplastics at electrolyte concentrations close to ccc nacl and cacl 2 with different concentrations of proteins bsa or lsz 2 5 10 20 and 50 mg l 2 4 derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo interaction the derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory was used to calculate the total interaction energy between pbat nanoplastics both the classical dlvo theory and the extended dlvo theory including the lewis acid base interaction were used details are given in section s1 2 5 stability of pbat nanoplastics in different natural water the stability of pbat nanoplastics was studied by measuring hydrodynamic diameter of both pristine and weathered pbat nanoplastics 150 mg l in different natural water samples three types of natural water samples were used 1 soil pore water 2 freshwater clark creek puyallup wa and 3 seawater puget sound tacoma wa the soil pore water was prepared by extracting soil water from saturated soil cores at 330 hpa with a ceramic pressure plate in a pressure chamber soil moisture equipment corp santa barbara ca the soil silt loam was collected from an agricultural field at the washington state university wsu puyallup research and extension center and saturated overnight with rainfall water collected from the field between march 15 2022 to april 14 2022 all water samples were filtered through 0 22 μ m membrane filters gswp04700 mf millipore milliporesigma burlington ma after collection and the chemical composition of these water samples is summarized in table s2 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of pristine and weathered pbat nanoplastics the sem images show that both pristine and weathered pbat nanoplastics were roughly spherical in shape with sizes of 128 4 nm and 142 8 nm respectively mean standard deviation n 50 fig 1a the sizes determined from sem images matched the hydrodynamic diameters measured with the dynamic light scattering which were 140 7 nm and 152 39 nm for pristine and weathered pbat nanoplastics respectively the difference in size for the pristine and weathered pbat nanoplastics can be attributed to the nanoplastic generation method which could not produce identical particle sizes the raman spectra revealed that the simulated solar exposure caused weathering of pbat mulch powder as the relative intensity of the characteristic peaks for the weathered pbat mulch powder decreased at 1270 cm 1 c oh stretch 1610 cm 1 c c stretch 1723 cm 1 c o stretch 2928 cm 1 c h stretch compared to that for the pristine pbat mulch powder fig 1b both the pristine and the weathered pbat nanoplastics were negatively charged at ph ranging from 3 to 11 while the weathered pbat nanoplastics were slightly more negatively charged fig 1c which can be attributed to the relative abundance of co stretch in the weathered pbat liu et al 2019 mistretta et al 2019 as ph increases both the pristine and the weathered pbat nanoplastics became more negatively charged but in the ph range of 5 8 typical for aquatic environments their ζ potentials remained relatively constant suggesting that the aggregation behavior of these nanoplastics is unlikely to be affected by ph in natural aquatic systems therefore in this study we carried out the aggregation kinetic experiments with a ph of 6 0 0 3 3 2 aggregation kinetics of pristine and weathered pbat nanoplastics in nacl and cacl 2 the aggregation profiles show that the aggregation of pristine pbat nanoplastics was promoted by increasing concentration of electrolytes while the aggregation of weathered pbat nanoplastics was not affected fig 2a b for the pristine pbat nanoplastics the hydrodynamic diameters remained unchanged at low concentrations of nacl 50 mm and cacl 2 10 mm when the concentrations of nacl and cacl 2 exceeded 67 mm and 15 mm respectively the hydrodynamic diameters gradually increased over time figure s1a b the aggregation rate as reflected by the attachment efficiency α increased with increasing electrolyte concentrations fig 2c as the concentrations of electrolyte further increased to the ccc i e 325 mm nacl and 20 mm cacl 2 the aggregation process changes from reaction limited to diffusion limited and α became constant such an aggregation behavior suggests that dlvo interactions controlled the aggregation of pristine pbat nanoplastics in the reaction limited regime i e electrolyte concentrations ccc the aggregation of particles is dominated by the repulsive electrical double layer forces indeed under lower electrolyte concentrations the ζ potentials of pristine pbat nanoplastics were more negatively charged fig 2d and the classical dlvo calculation indicated the presence of an energy barrier thus an overall repulsive interaction between pbat nanoplastics figure s2a while in the diffusion limited regime i e electrolyte concentrations ccc the energy barrier disappeared and the interaction became attractive figure s2a however the classical dlvo theory could not perfectly predict the aggregation of pristine pbat nanoplastics for instance at 100 mm nacl and 10 mm cacl 2 where the aggregation of pristine pbat nanoplastics was reaction limited the total interaction energy was calculated to be attractive figure s2a such a discrepancy can be attributed to the assumption that particles are perfect spheres with the surface charge uniformly distributed in the dlvo theory in addition non dlvo forces such as hydrophobicity could be accountable however the extended dlvo theory including the lewis acid base free energy predicted the interaction to be attractive under all electrolyte concentrations figure s2b suggesting a negligible effect of surface hydrophobicity on the aggregation of pristine pbat nanoplastics compared to na ca2 was more effective to induce aggregation of pristine pbat nanoplastics which is expected due to the more effective charge neutralization and charge screening of ca2 yang et al 2019 li et al 2021b indeed pristine pbat nanoplastic were less negatively charged in cacl 2 than in nacl fig 2d the ccc ratio of ca2 na was 2 4 and agrees well with the schulze hardy rule i e 2 6 to 2 2 elimelech et al 1995 confirming that ca2 is more effective to destabilize pristine pbat nanoplastics the more effective destabilization of ca2 did not cause an obvious difference in the aggregate size with the largest aggregate being 344 nm in nacl and 312 nm in cacl 2 at 50 min figure s1a b in contrast to the pristine pbat nanoplastics the hydrodynamic diameters of weathered pbat nanoplastics remained unchanged over the whole range of electrolyte concentrations figure s1c d indicating that weathered pbat nanoplastics were highly stable higher stability of particles is generally associated with more negative surface charges and thus stronger repulsive electrical double layer forces indeed weathered pbat nanoplastics were more negatively charged as indicated by the ζ potentials fig 2d likely due to the abundance of oxygen containing functional group i e c o however the negative charge of weathered pbat nanoplastics alone could not explain their high stability given that both the classical and extended dlvo calculations showed no obvious differences between pristine and weathered pbat nanoplastics in terms of the total interaction energy figure s2 in addition to surface charge surface roughness has been reported to contribute profoundly to colloid stability badaire et al 2008 lan et al 2018 it is thus likely that the uv weathering process induced roughening of pbat nanoplastic surfaces as was reported for other plastics qin et al 2022 3 3 aggregation of pristine and weathered pbat nanoplastics in the presence of bovine serum albumin bsa figure s3a b shows the aggregation profiles of pristine pbat nanoplastics in the presence of 10 mg l bsa in nacl and cacl 2 compared to the absence of bsa pristine pbat nanoplastics became destabilized at lower electrolyte concentrations i e 50 mm nacl and 2 mm cacl 2 and grew into larger aggregate at higher electrolyte concentrations i e 413 nm in nacl and 452 nm in cacl 2 this indicates that the presence of 10 mg l bsa promoted the aggregation of pristine pbat nanoplastics at both low and high electrolyte concentrations however the presence of bsa barely changed the ccc in nacl nor in cacl 2 which was 332 mm nacl and 23 mm cacl 2 fig 3a the aggregation of pristine pbat nanoplastics apparently followed a typical dlvo type aggregation in the presence of bsa suggesting the dominant role of electrical double layer forces indeed the ζ potentials of pbat nanoplastics generally became less negative with increasing electrolyte concentrations figure s4a leading to more attractive interactions between pbat nanoplastics in the presence of bsa figure s4b in addition bsa can induce attractive patch charge interaction and thus promote the aggregation of pbat nanoplastics as previously reported for hematite nanoparticles and polystyrene nanoplastics sheng et al 2016 li et al 2021b unlike our findings previous studies have reported that bsa tends to stabilize single walled carbon nanotubes mno 2 colloids and polystyrene nanoplastics through imposing steric repulsion saleh et al 2010 huangfu et al 2013 li et al 2021a however steric repulsion can only become important when particles are fully and uniformly covered by bsa unfortunately we could not quantify the absorbed amount of bsa on pbat nanoplastics by centrifugation due to their small size and low density but we found that the presence of bsa at low concentrations 10 mg l promoted the aggregation of pristine pbat nanoplastics while further increase in bsa concentrations showed a less promoting effect figure s5a b this is likely due to the attractive patch charge interactions caused by the uneven and incomplete coverage of pbat nanoplastics by bsa resulting in bsa rich areas of pbat nanoplastics encounter bsa poor areas of other pbat nanoplastics li et al 2021b further the attractive patch charge interactions become less pronounced with increasing bsa concentrations as more surface area of pbat nanoplastics became covered by bsa bsa can also induce the aggregation of pbat nanoplastics through bridging flocculation where a polymer chain of bsa interacts with more than one nanoplastics and therefore leads to the formation of aggregates biggs et al 2000 li et al 2021b for the weathered pbat nanoplastics the presence of 10 mg l bsa did not affect the aggregation weathered pbat nanoplastics remained stable under all electrolyte concentrations fig 3b further increase of bsa concentration did not lead to aggregation of weathered pbat nanoplastics in either 1000 mm nacl nor 50 mm cacl 2 figure s5c d however ζ potentials of weathered pbat nanoplastics became less negative in the presence of bsa and the classical dlvo theory predicted attractive interactions between weathered pbat nanoplastics in nacl 100 mm and cacl 2 2 mm this discrepancy is consistent with the discrepancy observed for weathered pbat nanoplastics in pure electrolyte solutions suggesting the dominant role of surface roughness to stabilize weathered pbat nanoplastics 3 4 aggregation of pristine and weathered pbat nanoplastics in the presence of lysozyme lsz the presence of 10 mg l lsz promoted the aggregation of pristine pbat nanoplastics under all electrolyte concentrations figure s6 it has been reported that lsz could induce aggregation of silica particles through bridging which is related to the high positive excess charge density and low dipole moment of lsz bharti et al 2011 besides the positive charge of lsz can neutralize the surface charge of pristine pbat nanoplastics and reduces electrical double layer forces figure s7 however further increase in electrolyte concentrations led to a slightly decreased effect of lsz on aggregation as α at higher electrolyte concentrations became less than 1 relative to the α at the lowest electrolyte concentrations fig 3c this is contradictory to the prediction made by dlvo figure s7b where the interaction became more attractive as the electrolyte concentration increases this could be due to the conformational changes of proteins which are known to reduce attractive interactions between protein coated surfaces at high electrolyte concentrations xu and logan 2005 further increase in lsz concentration enhanced the aggregation of pristine pbat nanoplastics in 20 mm cacl 2 but not in 300 mm nacl figure s8a b which is likely due to the bridging effect between ca2 and lsz coated surfaces compared to bsa lsz promoted the aggregation of pristine pbat nanoplastics to a larger extent which can be attributed to the tendency of lsz to form dimers that support the binding of lsz coated pbat nanoplastics claesson et al 1995 unlike the pristine pbat nanoplastics the weathered pbat nanoplastics remained stable under most electrolyte concentrations in the presence of 10 mg l lsz and only slightly aggregated in 10 mm cacl 2 fig 3d this again demonstrated the high stability of weathered pbat nanoplastics that was inherently controlled by the surface roughness of the nanoplastics and unlikely be affected by the presence of proteins nonetheless the presence of lsz at low concentrations of cacl 2 slightly promoted the aggregation of weathered pbat nanoplastics likely caused by the bridging between ca2 and lsz coated surfaces in addition further increase in lsz did not trigger aggregation of weathered pbat nanoplastic in 1000 mm nacl nor in 50 mm cacl 2 figure s8c d 3 5 stability of pbat nanoplastics in natural waters aggregation and stability of pristine and weathered pbat nanoplastics were explored in soil pore water freshwater and seawater fig 4 in the soil pore water pristine pbat nanoplastics showed weak aggregation which is likely caused by the relatively high concentration of ca2 3 3 mm in the soil pore water table s2 while this is lower than the experimentally determined ccc in cacl 2 i e 20 mm other ions i e na k mg 2 cl and so 4 2 also contribute to the ionic strength causing the weak aggregation in the freshwater river water no aggregation of pristine pbat nanoplastics was observed consistent with the low electrolyte concentrations in the water in the seawater however pristine pbat nanoplastics showed pronounced aggregation which is caused by the high concentrations of na 176 1 mm k 7 6 mm mg 2 21 6 mm and ca2 6 3 mm contributing to an ionic strength readily exceeding the ccc table s2 in contrast to the pristine pbat nanoplastics the weathered pbat nanoplastics did not show aggregation in any of the water samples consistent with its high stability observed in nacl and cacl 2 overall the aggregation of pristine and weathered pbat nanoplastics in natural waters followed the trend observed in the aggregation kinetic experiments 4 conclusions our study showed that in general pristine and weathered biodegradable pbat nanoplastics form highly stable suspensions in aquatic environments when exposed to environmental conditions proteins can sorb onto the surfaces of nanoplastics thereby modifying the surface properties and colloidal stability of the particles while the presence of negative charged proteins i e bsa only slightly promoted the aggregation of pristine pbat nanoplastics the presence of positive charged proteins i e lsz profoundly promoted the aggregation of pristine pbat nanoplastics this highlights the distinctively different role of negative charged and positive charged proteins and the importance of eco coronas in controlling the colloidal stability of nanoplastics however neither the negative charged proteins i e bsa nor the positive charged i e lsz proteins could promote aggregation of weathered pbat nanoplastics under most experimental conditions suggesting the more dominate role of weathering on determining the environmental fate of nanoplastics in natural waters organic and inorganic compounds will interact with biodegradable nanoplastics affecting their aggregation behavior and stability in both soil pore water and river water pristine and weathered pbat nanoplastics are highly stable suggesting that these nanoplastics can be transported through terrestrial and freshwater systems to the ocean once entering the marine environment the increased ionic strength destabilizes the pristine pbat nanoplastics but not the weathered pbat nanoplastics nonetheless this study shows that biodegradable nanoplastics have a high colloidal stability and thus have the potential to be mobile in terrestrial and freshwater systems which may facilitate their migration to the aquatic environment where they may become persistent pollutants due to limited degradability therefore it is important to appropriately dispose and manage biodegradable plastic wastes preventing the exposure of biodegradable plastics to the aquatic environment supporting information supporting information includes details on dlvo calculations experimental conditions for aggregation kinetics of pristine and weathered pbat nanoplastics chemical

14759,plastic pollution caused by conventional plastics has promoted the development and use of biodegradable plastics however biodegradable plastics do not degrade readily in water instead they can generate micro and nanoplastics compared to microplastics nanoplastics are more likely to cause negative impacts to the aquatic environment due to their smaller size the impacts of biodegradable nanoplastics highly depend on their aggregation behavior and colloidal stability which still remain unknown here we studied the aggregation kinetics of biodegradable nanoplastics made of polybutylene adipate co terephthalate pbat in nacl and cacl 2 solutions as well as in natural waters before and after weathering we further studied the effect of proteins on aggregation kinetics with both negative charged bovine serum albumin bsa and positive charged lysozyme lsz for pristine pbat nanoplastics before weathering ca2 destabilized nanoplastic suspensions more aggressively than na with the critical coagulation concentration being 20 mm in cacl 2 vs 325 mm in nacl both bsa and lsz promoted the aggregation of pristine pbat nanoplastics and lsz showed a more pronounced effect however no aggregation was observed for weathered pbat nanoplastics under most experimental conditions further stability tests demonstrated that pristine pbat nanoplastics aggregated substantially in seawater but not in freshwater and only slightly in soil pore water while weathered pbat nanoplastics remained stable in all natural waters these results suggest that biodegradable nanoplastics especially weathered biodegradable nanoplastics are highly stable in the aquatic environment even in the marine environment graphical abstract keywords biodegradable nanoplastics polybutylene adipate co terephthalate pbat aggregation protein weathering natural water data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction plastic has become a serious pollutant in the environment it was reported that approximately 8300 million metric tons of plastics were produced by 2017 and 4900 million metric tons were discarded in landfills or the natural environment geyer et al 2017 these discarded plastics threaten ecosystems not only by themselves but also by the generated micro and nanoplastics during breakdown large plastic pieces can entangle animals in land and in water leading to reduced mobility and starvation law 2017 ryan 2018 while micro and nanoplastics can be ingested and inhaled by animals causing decreased food uptake impeded growth and inflammation cole and galloway 2015 espinosa et al 2018 prata 2018 to alleviate these problems biodegradable plastics have been proposed to replace conventional plastics particularly for single use plastics unlike conventional plastics which are persistent and can reside in the environment for decades or even centuries nithin and goel 2017 biodegradable plastics can degrade completely in months or years when disposed of in appropriate environments narancic et al 2018 tosin et al 2019 sintim et al 2020 although biodegradable plastics can be metabolized by microorganisms and be converted into co 2 ch 4 and biomass haider et al 2019 flury and narayan 2021 they inevitably generate micro and nanoplastics during degradation gonzález pleiter et al 2019 sintim et al 2019 the generated micro and nanoplastics will unlikely pose an environmental threat if biodegradable plastic waste is appropriately managed and disposed of in industrial composting or anaerobic digestion facilities where full degradation of the plastics can be reached before the generated micro and nanoplastics are released to the environment kubowicz and booth 2017 yu et al 2021 however mismanagement or off site transport can happen leading to exposure of biodegradable plastics and thus to the release of micro and nanoplastics to the environment exposure of biodegradable plastics to the aquatic environment can be especially concerning as shown in previous studies biodegradable plastics made of polybutylene adipate co terephthalate pbat did not readily degrade in water wang et al 2019 instead they generated more microplastics than low density polyethylene plastics wei et al 2021 these generated biodegradable microplastics may persist and accumulate in the aquatic environment and further fragment into secondary nanoplastics secondary nanoplastics were indeed found to be released from biodegradable microplastics made of polyhydroxybutyrate when the microplastics were immersed in water and these nanoplastics further induced decrease in cellular growth and altered physiological parameters of freshwater cyanobacterium alga and crustacean gonzález pleiter et al 2019 this raises concerns about the impacts of secondary biodegradable nanoplastics in the aquatic environment the impacts of secondary nanoplastics on aquatic ecosystems depend on the nanoplastics aggregation behavior and colloidal stability aggregation and stability of nanoplastics have been intensively studied with model polystyrene nanoplastics liu et al 2019 wang et al 2020 li et al 2021b but only a few studies with other types of polymers exist shams et al 2020 these studies show that particle particle interactions are controlled by surface properties and solution chemistry surface properties of nanoplastics can be modified by weathering which increases the negative charge of nanoplastics and inhibits aggregation liu et al 2019 wang et al 2020 besides extracellular polymeric substances such as proteins can cover nanoplastics with a corona which can either hinder aggregation through imposing steric repulsion or promote aggregation through decreasing electrostatic interaction li et al 2021b however to the best of our knowledge no information is currently available about the effects of weathering and proteins on aggregation of biodegradable nanoplastics to fill this knowledge gap we studied the aggregation behavior of biodegradable nanoplastics generated from a pbat mulch film the pbat mulch film was chosen because pbat is the most commonly used polymer in biodegradable plastic mulch films which are intentionally introduced into the environment through soil incorporation the aggregation of pbat nanoplastics before and after weathering was examined in both nacl and cacl 2 solutions na ca2 and cl represent common ions in natural water the effect of proteins was studied with negative charged bovine serum albumin bsa and positive charged lysozyme lsz both bsa and lsz are abundant in natural waters and have been commonly used as model proteins to study the interaction between nanoplastics and proteins dong et al 2020 li et al 2021a b further we determined the stability of pbat nanoplastics in soil pore water freshwater and seawater to estimate the potential of biodegradable nanoplastics to migrate from land to oceans we hypothesized that 1 weathering stabilizes pbat nanoplastics 2 proteins promote the aggregation of pbat nanoplastics and 3 pbat nanoplastics are highly stable in natural waters 2 materials and methods 2 1 pristine and weathered pbat nanoplastics a biodegradable plastic mulch film made of polybutylene adipate co terephthalate pbat bioagri biobag americas dunedin fl was used to generate pbat nanoplastics the pbat mulch film was black with a thickness of 29 1 2 μ m and a density of 22 8 0 4 g m 2 further properties of the film are given in hayes et al 2017 briefly film pieces 12 cm 2 cm were cut off from a new roll of mulch film sequentially soaked in deionized water and liquid nitrogen and then blended milled sieved wet ground and air dried astner et al 2019 the resulting mulch powder 7 g was suspended in deionized water filtered through a 0 45 μ m membrane filter hawp04700 mf millipore milliporesigma burlington ma and then through a 0 22 μ m syringe filter slgp033rb millex gp merck millipore ltd ireland the filtrate was collected as the stock suspension of pristine pbat nanoplastics the stock suspension had a concentration of about 470 mg l based on gravimetric analysis the stock suspension of weathered pbat nanoplastics was prepared from uv weathered ground mulch powder an aliquot 7 g of the ground mulch powder was irradiated with a 1 kw xenon arc lamp wavelength 300 800 nm 650 w m 2 in an atlas suntest cps solar simulator atlas material testing technology llc mount prospect il for 336 h the 336 h exposure is equivalent to 66 days of european mean solar irradiance gewert et al 2018 which represents the sunlight exposure of biodegradable plastic mulch films during growing seasons the sample was placed into a pyrex glass beaker 200 ml and manually mixed every 24 h to ensure uniform weathering then the sample was suspended in deionized water and filtered sequentially through 0 45 μ m membrane filters and 0 22 μ m syringe filters to collect filtrate containing weathered pbat nanoplastics and the filtrate had a concentration of about 380 mg l gravimetrically determined 2 2 characterization of pristine and weathered pbat nanoplastics the morphology and size of pristine and weathered pbat nanoplastics were visualized with scanning electron microscopy sem fei apreo volumescope sem fei company hillsboro or briefly a suspension 150 mg l of either pristine or weathered pbat nanoplastics was sonicated for 10 min branson ultrasonicator b 52 50 60 hz 440 watts to break up any aggregates and disperse nanoplastics and a drop 5 μ l was deposited onto a sem stub air dried in vacuum for 20 min gold coated and imaged with sem the hydrodynamic diameters of pristine and weathered pbat nanoplastics in deionized water to obtain the intrinsic size were measured with a zetasizer nano zs malvern instruments ltd malvern uk to study the effect of ph the ζ potentials were measured in 10 mm nacl with the zetasizer over a wide range of ph 3 to 11 ph adjusted with 10 mm hcl or 10 mm naoh the effect of weathering was characterized with raman spectroscopy labram horiba kyoto japan the raman spectra of both pristine and weathered pbat mulch powder were collected using a 633 nm he ne laser with a 50 objective numerical aperture 0 75 2 3 determination of aggregation kinetics the aggregation kinetics of pristine and weathered pbat nanoplastics were measured with the zetasizer using the time resolved dynamic light scattering in nacl 10 mm to 1000 mm and cacl 2 2 mm to 50 mm solutions detailed experimental conditions are given in table s1 prior to the measurement the stock suspensions of pbat nanoplastics and the electrolyte solutions were adjusted to the same ph using 10 mm hcl or naoh for each measurement the stock suspension of pbat nanoplastics was sonicated for 10 min and then aliquots of the stock suspension deionized water and electrolyte solution were pipetted into a disposable plastic cuvette to achieve desired nanoplastic and electrolyte concentrations 150 mg l for both pristine and weathered pbat nanoplastics the concentration was chosen to ensure a good signal from the dynamic light scattering measurement the cuvette was briefly vortexed for 3 s and placed into the zetasizer and dynamic light scattering measurement in terms of hydrodynamic diameter d h was immediately carried out at 25 o c with the auto correlation function accumulated for 2 min and continued for 50 min to obtain aggregation profiles each measurement was conducted in duplicates the initial aggregation rate constant k of pbat nanoplastics was determined as the slope of the linear least squares regression of the aggregation profiles up to the point where d h t increased to 1 5 d h t 0 because k is proportional to the initial rate of increase in d h with time holthoff et al 1996 chen et al 2006 berg 2010 1 k 1 n 0 d d h t d t t 0 where n 0 is the initial nanoplastic concentration to quantify the aggregation kinetics the attachment efficiency α was calculated by normalizing the initial aggregation rate constant k by the initial aggregation rate constant under diffusion limited fast aggregation condition k fast chen et al 2006 berg 2010 2 α k k fast 1 n 0 d d h t d t t 0 1 n 0 fast d d h t d t t 0 fast where n 0 fast was equal to n 0 in the aggregation experiments the critical coagulation concentration ccc was then determined as the electrolyte concentration where the extrapolated linear regression line of α values in reaction limited regimes intersects with α 1 in diffusion limited regimes in logarithmic coordinates berg 2010 yang et al 2019 to study the effect of proteins suspensions of negative charged bovine serum albumin bsa molecular weight 66 5 kda isoelectric point is ph 4 7 a8806 milliporesigma burlington ma and positive charged lysozyme lsz molecular weight 14 3 kda isoelectric point is ph 11 l6876 milliporesigma burlington ma were prepared using deionized water with ph adjusted to the same value as the pbat nanoplastic suspensions and the electrolyte solutions after sonicating suspensions of pbat nanoplastics and proteins separately 10 min aliquots of pbat nanoplastics proteins and electrolyte were pipetted into a disposable plastic cuvette to achieve desired protein and electrolyte concentrations and dynamic light scattering measurements were carried out immediately after vortexing aggregation profiles of pristine and weathered pbat nanoplastics were obtained in the presence of a fixed concentration of proteins bsa or lsz 10 mg l in nacl and cacl 2 solutions in the presence of bsa a monotonic increase in k was found as the electrolyte concentration increases thus α was calculated in the same way as in the absence of proteins and ccc values with bsa were further determined while in the presence of lsz k generally decreased as the electrolyte concentration increased thus α was calculated with k fast being the initial aggregation rate constant of pbat nanoplastics at the lowest electrolyte concentration besides we obtained aggregation profiles of pristine and weathered pbat nanoplastics at electrolyte concentrations close to ccc nacl and cacl 2 with different concentrations of proteins bsa or lsz 2 5 10 20 and 50 mg l 2 4 derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo interaction the derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory was used to calculate the total interaction energy between pbat nanoplastics both the classical dlvo theory and the extended dlvo theory including the lewis acid base interaction were used details are given in section s1 2 5 stability of pbat nanoplastics in different natural water the stability of pbat nanoplastics was studied by measuring hydrodynamic diameter of both pristine and weathered pbat nanoplastics 150 mg l in different natural water samples three types of natural water samples were used 1 soil pore water 2 freshwater clark creek puyallup wa and 3 seawater puget sound tacoma wa the soil pore water was prepared by extracting soil water from saturated soil cores at 330 hpa with a ceramic pressure plate in a pressure chamber soil moisture equipment corp santa barbara ca the soil silt loam was collected from an agricultural field at the washington state university wsu puyallup research and extension center and saturated overnight with rainfall water collected from the field between march 15 2022 to april 14 2022 all water samples were filtered through 0 22 μ m membrane filters gswp04700 mf millipore milliporesigma burlington ma after collection and the chemical composition of these water samples is summarized in table s2 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of pristine and weathered pbat nanoplastics the sem images show that both pristine and weathered pbat nanoplastics were roughly spherical in shape with sizes of 128 4 nm and 142 8 nm respectively mean standard deviation n 50 fig 1a the sizes determined from sem images matched the hydrodynamic diameters measured with the dynamic light scattering which were 140 7 nm and 152 39 nm for pristine and weathered pbat nanoplastics respectively the difference in size for the pristine and weathered pbat nanoplastics can be attributed to the nanoplastic generation method which could not produce identical particle sizes the raman spectra revealed that the simulated solar exposure caused weathering of pbat mulch powder as the relative intensity of the characteristic peaks for the weathered pbat mulch powder decreased at 1270 cm 1 c oh stretch 1610 cm 1 c c stretch 1723 cm 1 c o stretch 2928 cm 1 c h stretch compared to that for the pristine pbat mulch powder fig 1b both the pristine and the weathered pbat nanoplastics were negatively charged at ph ranging from 3 to 11 while the weathered pbat nanoplastics were slightly more negatively charged fig 1c which can be attributed to the relative abundance of co stretch in the weathered pbat liu et al 2019 mistretta et al 2019 as ph increases both the pristine and the weathered pbat nanoplastics became more negatively charged but in the ph range of 5 8 typical for aquatic environments their ζ potentials remained relatively constant suggesting that the aggregation behavior of these nanoplastics is unlikely to be affected by ph in natural aquatic systems therefore in this study we carried out the aggregation kinetic experiments with a ph of 6 0 0 3 3 2 aggregation kinetics of pristine and weathered pbat nanoplastics in nacl and cacl 2 the aggregation profiles show that the aggregation of pristine pbat nanoplastics was promoted by increasing concentration of electrolytes while the aggregation of weathered pbat nanoplastics was not affected fig 2a b for the pristine pbat nanoplastics the hydrodynamic diameters remained unchanged at low concentrations of nacl 50 mm and cacl 2 10 mm when the concentrations of nacl and cacl 2 exceeded 67 mm and 15 mm respectively the hydrodynamic diameters gradually increased over time figure s1a b the aggregation rate as reflected by the attachment efficiency α increased with increasing electrolyte concentrations fig 2c as the concentrations of electrolyte further increased to the ccc i e 325 mm nacl and 20 mm cacl 2 the aggregation process changes from reaction limited to diffusion limited and α became constant such an aggregation behavior suggests that dlvo interactions controlled the aggregation of pristine pbat nanoplastics in the reaction limited regime i e electrolyte concentrations ccc the aggregation of particles is dominated by the repulsive electrical double layer forces indeed under lower electrolyte concentrations the ζ potentials of pristine pbat nanoplastics were more negatively charged fig 2d and the classical dlvo calculation indicated the presence of an energy barrier thus an overall repulsive interaction between pbat nanoplastics figure s2a while in the diffusion limited regime i e electrolyte concentrations ccc the energy barrier disappeared and the interaction became attractive figure s2a however the classical dlvo theory could not perfectly predict the aggregation of pristine pbat nanoplastics for instance at 100 mm nacl and 10 mm cacl 2 where the aggregation of pristine pbat nanoplastics was reaction limited the total interaction energy was calculated to be attractive figure s2a such a discrepancy can be attributed to the assumption that particles are perfect spheres with the surface charge uniformly distributed in the dlvo theory in addition non dlvo forces such as hydrophobicity could be accountable however the extended dlvo theory including the lewis acid base free energy predicted the interaction to be attractive under all electrolyte concentrations figure s2b suggesting a negligible effect of surface hydrophobicity on the aggregation of pristine pbat nanoplastics compared to na ca2 was more effective to induce aggregation of pristine pbat nanoplastics which is expected due to the more effective charge neutralization and charge screening of ca2 yang et al 2019 li et al 2021b indeed pristine pbat nanoplastic were less negatively charged in cacl 2 than in nacl fig 2d the ccc ratio of ca2 na was 2 4 and agrees well with the schulze hardy rule i e 2 6 to 2 2 elimelech et al 1995 confirming that ca2 is more effective to destabilize pristine pbat nanoplastics the more effective destabilization of ca2 did not cause an obvious difference in the aggregate size with the largest aggregate being 344 nm in nacl and 312 nm in cacl 2 at 50 min figure s1a b in contrast to the pristine pbat nanoplastics the hydrodynamic diameters of weathered pbat nanoplastics remained unchanged over the whole range of electrolyte concentrations figure s1c d indicating that weathered pbat nanoplastics were highly stable higher stability of particles is generally associated with more negative surface charges and thus stronger repulsive electrical double layer forces indeed weathered pbat nanoplastics were more negatively charged as indicated by the ζ potentials fig 2d likely due to the abundance of oxygen containing functional group i e c o however the negative charge of weathered pbat nanoplastics alone could not explain their high stability given that both the classical and extended dlvo calculations showed no obvious differences between pristine and weathered pbat nanoplastics in terms of the total interaction energy figure s2 in addition to surface charge surface roughness has been reported to contribute profoundly to colloid stability badaire et al 2008 lan et al 2018 it is thus likely that the uv weathering process induced roughening of pbat nanoplastic surfaces as was reported for other plastics qin et al 2022 3 3 aggregation of pristine and weathered pbat nanoplastics in the presence of bovine serum albumin bsa figure s3a b shows the aggregation profiles of pristine pbat nanoplastics in the presence of 10 mg l bsa in nacl and cacl 2 compared to the absence of bsa pristine pbat nanoplastics became destabilized at lower electrolyte concentrations i e 50 mm nacl and 2 mm cacl 2 and grew into larger aggregate at higher electrolyte concentrations i e 413 nm in nacl and 452 nm in cacl 2 this indicates that the presence of 10 mg l bsa promoted the aggregation of pristine pbat nanoplastics at both low and high electrolyte concentrations however the presence of bsa barely changed the ccc in nacl nor in cacl 2 which was 332 mm nacl and 23 mm cacl 2 fig 3a the aggregation of pristine pbat nanoplastics apparently followed a typical dlvo type aggregation in the presence of bsa suggesting the dominant role of electrical double layer forces indeed the ζ potentials of pbat nanoplastics generally became less negative with increasing electrolyte concentrations figure s4a leading to more attractive interactions between pbat nanoplastics in the presence of bsa figure s4b in addition bsa can induce attractive patch charge interaction and thus promote the aggregation of pbat nanoplastics as previously reported for hematite nanoparticles and polystyrene nanoplastics sheng et al 2016 li et al 2021b unlike our findings previous studies have reported that bsa tends to stabilize single walled carbon nanotubes mno 2 colloids and polystyrene nanoplastics through imposing steric repulsion saleh et al 2010 huangfu et al 2013 li et al 2021a however steric repulsion can only become important when particles are fully and uniformly covered by bsa unfortunately we could not quantify the absorbed amount of bsa on pbat nanoplastics by centrifugation due to their small size and low density but we found that the presence of bsa at low concentrations 10 mg l promoted the aggregation of pristine pbat nanoplastics while further increase in bsa concentrations showed a less promoting effect figure s5a b this is likely due to the attractive patch charge interactions caused by the uneven and incomplete coverage of pbat nanoplastics by bsa resulting in bsa rich areas of pbat nanoplastics encounter bsa poor areas of other pbat nanoplastics li et al 2021b further the attractive patch charge interactions become less pronounced with increasing bsa concentrations as more surface area of pbat nanoplastics became covered by bsa bsa can also induce the aggregation of pbat nanoplastics through bridging flocculation where a polymer chain of bsa interacts with more than one nanoplastics and therefore leads to the formation of aggregates biggs et al 2000 li et al 2021b for the weathered pbat nanoplastics the presence of 10 mg l bsa did not affect the aggregation weathered pbat nanoplastics remained stable under all electrolyte concentrations fig 3b further increase of bsa concentration did not lead to aggregation of weathered pbat nanoplastics in either 1000 mm nacl nor 50 mm cacl 2 figure s5c d however ζ potentials of weathered pbat nanoplastics became less negative in the presence of bsa and the classical dlvo theory predicted attractive interactions between weathered pbat nanoplastics in nacl 100 mm and cacl 2 2 mm this discrepancy is consistent with the discrepancy observed for weathered pbat nanoplastics in pure electrolyte solutions suggesting the dominant role of surface roughness to stabilize weathered pbat nanoplastics 3 4 aggregation of pristine and weathered pbat nanoplastics in the presence of lysozyme lsz the presence of 10 mg l lsz promoted the aggregation of pristine pbat nanoplastics under all electrolyte concentrations figure s6 it has been reported that lsz could induce aggregation of silica particles through bridging which is related to the high positive excess charge density and low dipole moment of lsz bharti et al 2011 besides the positive charge of lsz can neutralize the surface charge of pristine pbat nanoplastics and reduces electrical double layer forces figure s7 however further increase in electrolyte concentrations led to a slightly decreased effect of lsz on aggregation as α at higher electrolyte concentrations became less than 1 relative to the α at the lowest electrolyte concentrations fig 3c this is contradictory to the prediction made by dlvo figure s7b where the interaction became more attractive as the electrolyte concentration increases this could be due to the conformational changes of proteins which are known to reduce attractive interactions between protein coated surfaces at high electrolyte concentrations xu and logan 2005 further increase in lsz concentration enhanced the aggregation of pristine pbat nanoplastics in 20 mm cacl 2 but not in 300 mm nacl figure s8a b which is likely due to the bridging effect between ca2 and lsz coated surfaces compared to bsa lsz promoted the aggregation of pristine pbat nanoplastics to a larger extent which can be attributed to the tendency of lsz to form dimers that support the binding of lsz coated pbat nanoplastics claesson et al 1995 unlike the pristine pbat nanoplastics the weathered pbat nanoplastics remained stable under most electrolyte concentrations in the presence of 10 mg l lsz and only slightly aggregated in 10 mm cacl 2 fig 3d this again demonstrated the high stability of weathered pbat nanoplastics that was inherently controlled by the surface roughness of the nanoplastics and unlikely be affected by the presence of proteins nonetheless the presence of lsz at low concentrations of cacl 2 slightly promoted the aggregation of weathered pbat nanoplastics likely caused by the bridging between ca2 and lsz coated surfaces in addition further increase in lsz did not trigger aggregation of weathered pbat nanoplastic in 1000 mm nacl nor in 50 mm cacl 2 figure s8c d 3 5 stability of pbat nanoplastics in natural waters aggregation and stability of pristine and weathered pbat nanoplastics were explored in soil pore water freshwater and seawater fig 4 in the soil pore water pristine pbat nanoplastics showed weak aggregation which is likely caused by the relatively high concentration of ca2 3 3 mm in the soil pore water table s2 while this is lower than the experimentally determined ccc in cacl 2 i e 20 mm other ions i e na k mg 2 cl and so 4 2 also contribute to the ionic strength causing the weak aggregation in the freshwater river water no aggregation of pristine pbat nanoplastics was observed consistent with the low electrolyte concentrations in the water in the seawater however pristine pbat nanoplastics showed pronounced aggregation which is caused by the high concentrations of na 176 1 mm k 7 6 mm mg 2 21 6 mm and ca2 6 3 mm contributing to an ionic strength readily exceeding the ccc table s2 in contrast to the pristine pbat nanoplastics the weathered pbat nanoplastics did not show aggregation in any of the water samples consistent with its high stability observed in nacl and cacl 2 overall the aggregation of pristine and weathered pbat nanoplastics in natural waters followed the trend observed in the aggregation kinetic experiments 4 conclusions our study showed that in general pristine and weathered biodegradable pbat nanoplastics form highly stable suspensions in aquatic environments when exposed to environmental conditions proteins can sorb onto the surfaces of nanoplastics thereby modifying the surface properties and colloidal stability of the particles while the presence of negative charged proteins i e bsa only slightly promoted the aggregation of pristine pbat nanoplastics the presence of positive charged proteins i e lsz profoundly promoted the aggregation of pristine pbat nanoplastics this highlights the distinctively different role of negative charged and positive charged proteins and the importance of eco coronas in controlling the colloidal stability of nanoplastics however neither the negative charged proteins i e bsa nor the positive charged i e lsz proteins could promote aggregation of weathered pbat nanoplastics under most experimental conditions suggesting the more dominate role of weathering on determining the environmental fate of nanoplastics in natural waters organic and inorganic compounds will interact with biodegradable nanoplastics affecting their aggregation behavior and stability in both soil pore water and river water pristine and weathered pbat nanoplastics are highly stable suggesting that these nanoplastics can be transported through terrestrial and freshwater systems to the ocean once entering the marine environment the increased ionic strength destabilizes the pristine pbat nanoplastics but not the weathered pbat nanoplastics nonetheless this study shows that biodegradable nanoplastics have a high colloidal stability and thus have the potential to be mobile in terrestrial and freshwater systems which may facilitate their migration to the aquatic environment where they may become persistent pollutants due to limited degradability therefore it is important to appropriately dispose and manage biodegradable plastic wastes preventing the exposure of biodegradable plastics to the aquatic environment supporting information supporting information includes details on dlvo calculations experimental conditions for aggregation kinetics of pristine and weathered pbat nanoplastics chemical
