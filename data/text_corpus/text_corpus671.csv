3355,acid in situ uranium leach mining is an effective popular technology for extracting uranium without large uranium mill tailings however acid in situ leaching causes extremely high concentrations of acidic contaminants in aquifers to represent the migration and range of acidic contaminant pollutants in confined aquifers this study applied the controlled source audio frequency magnetotellurics csamt method to a uranium mining area located in the yili basin xinjiang northwest china we collected ten csamt profiles from 364 sites with an average site interval of 20 m the electrical resistivity model of the uranium mining area was obtained via two dimensional inversion using csamt data with 23 frequencies ranging from 8192 hz to 4 hz combined with geological geochemical and well log data this resistivity model was successfully used to identify the scale and position of acid contaminant plumes beneath the uranium mining area which appear as electrically well defined features that closely coincide with the distribution of sulfate and uranium ions in groundwater with uranium mining activities ceasing the scale of acid contaminant plumes has been reduced owing to the natural attenuation of the aquifer or the contaminants well confined in the mining site the low permeability sandstone surrounding the aquifer was imaged as a resistive feature which confines the contaminant plumes to the uranium mining area and slows the downstream migration of contaminants according to the modified archie s law the porosity of the sandstone bearing uranium beneath the injection well zone increases owing to acidification while the porosity of the sandstone beneath the production well zone decreases owing to pore plugging keywords uranium mining in situ leaching groundwater contaminant csamt electrical resistivity structure 1 introduction as decarbonizing electricity systems becomes increasingly important nuclear energy which provides a stable source of low carbon baseload electricity and demand for uranium mineral resources have increased rapidly iaea 2020 with the development and utilization of uranium resources environmental pollution by radioactive materials inevitably arises because of uranium mining in situ leaching of uranium has been used in the mining of sandstone type uranium deposits since the 1980 s and is now the predominant method for mining uranium accounting for 50 of the uranium mined worldwide in 2020 iaea 2020 compared with the traditional mining technology it has the advantages of simple processing low cost reduced hazards for employees profitable production from lower grade ore and it does not require large uranium mill tailings deposits however in situ leaching methods especially acid leaching severely pollute groundwater mudd 2001 tan et al 2014 sinclair and thompson 2015 during the in situ leaching of uranium a large amount of acid leaching agent is injected into the ore bearing aquifer haque and norgate 2014 farjana et al 2018 lagneau et al 2019 uranium and other heavy metal elements leached by the acid leaching agent leave the aquifer during the production process and the remainder is contained in the aquifer zhou et al 2020 these residual leaching liquids diffuse and migrate to the surrounding aquifer under the action of the groundwater dynamic field which expands the scope of pollution and results in more severe acidic radioactive toxic and harmful pollution of groundwater hyks et al 2009 özverdi̇ and erdem 2010 zhang et al 2016 mukherjee et al 2020 mukherjee et al 2021 effective monitoring is key to controlling and preventing groundwater pollution in uranium mines groundwater pollution caused by in situ leach uranium mining is mainly monitored by analyzing the changes in groundwater quality samples from monitoring wells dong et al 2016 however this method is limited by the distribution of monitoring wells when groundwater is polluted changes in its chemical and physical properties cause local variations in the geophysical field zelt et al 2006 revil et al 2013 de clercq et al 2020 therefore geophysical methods can be used to map the location and depth of conductive leach solutions tweeton et al 1991 sinclair and thompson 2015 moradipour et al 2016 he et al 2018 detect the migration pathway and spatial distribution of pollutants in the ground doetsch et al 2012 deng et al 2017 and provide an early warning of any flow away from the area of containment minsley et al 2007 johnson et al 2012 furthermore geophysical methods for monitoring leach solutions have the potential to be powerful supplements and developments for existing borehole monitoring networks controlled source audio frequency magnetotellurics csamt is a frequency domain electromagnetic method that uses repetitive artificial signals generated by a grounded dipole or horizontal loop goldstein and strangway 1975 zonge and hughes 1991 di et al 2020 csamt data can be collected in areas with high cultural noise and rough terrain the csamt method is primarily based on the resistivity difference of rocks to detect features of the subsurface electrical structure goldstein and strangway 1975 zonge and hughes 1991 di et al 2020 it has been applied to various exploration problems worldwide including groundwater contamination tweeton et al 1991 sinclair and thompson 2015 he et al 2018 mineral exploration hu et al 2013 guo et al 2020 engineering detection unsworth et al 2000 di et al 2020 fluid monitoring darnet et al 2020 and groundwater surveys wu et al 2012 fu et al 2013 kouadio et al 2020 the resistivity of rock is highly sensitive to its porosity and the salinity of the fluid the depth of the uranium deposits in the yili basin is 100 200 m therefore the csamt method can be used to confirm the porosity change and fluid migration pathway of the rock in contrast to previous works which used only geophysical methods to characterize fluid changes qualitatively he et al 2018 this study combines csamt fluid geochemistry and well log data to image the scale and position of the acid contaminant plumes beneath the uranium mining area to quantitatively identify porosity changes in the sandstone bearing uranium ore 2 geological setting the yili basin fig 1 b in xinjiang is an important uranium deposit in the mesozoic and cenozoic basins and the first mine with in situ leaching of uranium in northern china zhou et al 2020 the uranium deposits are typical interlayer oxidation zones of the sandstone type song et al 2019 the yili basin is a continental depression basin derived from the interaction between the tarim and kazakhstan plates zhang and liu 2019 since the cenozoic the yili basin has been transformed and has reformed the earlier structures by uneven uplifting derived from the yanshan and himalayan movements zhang and liu 2019 the mesozoic and cenozoic strata in the southern slope zone of the yili basin are generally inclined to the north at the angles of 5 8 and are the main distribution locations of sandstone type uranium deposits fig 2 dai et al 2015 zhou et al 2020 the basement of the yili basin is mainly composed of carboniferous permian volcanic sedimentary rocks and precambrian crystalline rocks with a small number of proterozoic granites zhang and liu 2019 the unconformable overlying rocks above the basement are mainly composed of the upper triassic xiaoquangou group the middle and lower jurassic shuixigou group and the cretaceous cenozoic red beds wang et al 2021 the uranium mineralization is mainly distributed in the shuixigou group which consists of a series of fluvial limnological facies coal bearing clastic rocks with well developed sandstone bodies containing abundant organic matters zhou et al 2020 wang et al 2021 the yili basin is an infiltration artesian basin and the topographical features of the basin are high in the south and low in the north multiple aquifers are distributed in the stratum of the mining area all of which are confined aquifers dong et al 2016 the thickness of the aquifer mainly composed of medium grained sandstone and glutenite with good permeability is 10 30 m the water head of the aquifer is the range of 112 150 m and the average velocity of regional groundwater is approximately 0 013 0 029 m d according to field investigation the seasonal water table fluctuation is the range of 2 5 m the flood period is from june to july every year and the maximum flow of the seasonal river near the mining area is 0 09 m3 s after flowing through the mining area the surface water infiltrates and replenishes the quaternary pore water and the change of water level lags behind the surface water flood period by about 4 months there are impermeable layers composed of mudstone siltstone and coal on the top and bottom of the aquifer which makes the upper and lower aquifers form their own systems without hydraulic connection fig 2 dong et al 2016 the qapqal mountain area in the south is a groundwater replenishment area the source of groundwater is bedrock fissure water and atmospheric precipitation which replenishes the ore bearing aquifer through surface runoff and quaternary phreatic water zhou et al 2020 the mining area is in the runoff area of the groundwater with alluvial fan slopes on the surface the thickness of the ore bearing aquifer is 15 25 m and the hydraulic conductivity is estimated at 0 52 1 16 m day dong et al 2016 due to the unconformity contact relationship between the ore bearing aquifer and the overlying aquifer in the process of mining wang et al 2021 with the extraction of groundwater from the ore bearing aquifer the inherent recharge balance relationship with other aquifers and surface water is disturbed making other aquifers and surface water recharge ore bearing aquifer dong et al 2016 before mining activities the mineralization level of the nature groundwater was 0 23 0 69 g l consisting mainly of mg na ca so4 and hco3 and the ph value of the nature groundwater ranged from 7 8 to 8 5 dong et al 2016 zhou et al 2020 the major minerals in the ore bearing aquifer are rock debris 5 carbonaceous material 0 5 clay minerals 40 60 and quartz 30 50 zhou et al 2020 the mining sites were divided into three zones based on the year in which the mining activity started fig 1c zone a started mining in 1992 and was shut down in 1996 zone b started production in 1995 and closed in 2009 zone c was still in production during field investigation during the in situ leaching process of uranium ore an acid solution is injected into a confined ore bearing aquifer through several injection wells and then pumped out dissolved uranium and other chemicals through the extraction well dong et al 2016 the wellbore casing has sufficient integrity to withstand the cementation of the annular space to isolate the leaching zone and not prevent geophysical and hydrological observations during the in situ leaching process zhou et al 2020 the thickness of the ore bearing aquifer beneath the zones a and b was approximately 10 15 m the depth of the uranium deposit is 100 140 m and the length of the screen of the injection and production wells was 5 10 m in the process of uranium mining injection and production wells are used for mixed pumping and high concentration sulfuric acid 15 20 g l is injected into the uranium orebody for an acidification time of 40 45 days 3 method and data 3 1 csamt data acquisition csamt is an artificial source frequency domain electromagnetic method the distance between the two transmitting electrodes ab was 1 2 km the measurement was carried out 6 12 km from the field source which can be approximated as a plane wave at high frequencies fig 3 the electric field ex parallel to ab and the magnetic field hy perpendicular to ab were measured using an electric field dipole and high gain magnetic field coil respectively fig 3 the measurement frequency of csamt is typically in the range of 0 125 8192 hz and the penetration depth is typically up to 2 3 km lateral resolution is typically in the range of 10 200 m depending on the measured dipole length the vertical resolution typically falls in the range of 5 20 of the depth under investigation goldstein and strangway 1975 zonge and hughes 1991 the csamt survey within the uranium mining site consisted of ten survey profiles fig 1c survey arrays with seven 20 meter dipoles and magnetic coils were simultaneously used to collect scalar electric field data and a magnetic field using a zonge gdp 32 ii multifunctional receiver csamt data were recorded at 364 sites 23 frequencies were used ranging from 8192 to 4 hz and were processed to calculate the apparent resistivity and phase the controlled electromagnetic field was generated using a zonge ggt 30 transmitter located 12 km from the uranium mining site the electric dipole s transmitter length which was laid on the sedimentary sequence was 2000 m resulting in a higher attenuation of electromagnetic signals on the path from the transmitter to the receiver this transmitter produced high quality data such that they were interpretable with 2d inversion 3 2 csamt data processing in this survey all csamt data were recorded in the far field thus the apparent resistivity and phase of each site were calculated using the cagniard resistivity from the ratio of the electric field ex to the magnetic field hy cagniard 1953 the cagniard resistivity ρ and phase φ are expressed as follows 1 ρ 1 5 f e x 2 h y 2 φ arctan im e x h y re e x h y where ρ is the apparent resistivity and f is the frequency the distortion effect of the electric field is evident owing to the presence of lateral nonuniformity in the near surface conductivity the static shift effect is caused by charge accumulation at the boundaries of conductive inhomogeneities and the inability to distinguish small inhomogeneous bodies in the shallow layer which leads to a fictitious subsurface structure and an incorrect geological interpretation jones 1988 groom and bailey 1989 jiracek 1990 in this study the hanning window spatial filter method was used to eliminate the static effect torres verdín and bostick 1992 because the csamt data in the survey were continuous measurements along each profile the hanning window in the spatial filter is expressed as follows 2 h x 1 w 1 cos 2 π x w x w 2 0 x w 2 where is the filter length and w is the width of the hanning window h x is applied at seven points the typical apparent resistivity and phase curves of the four csamt sites are shown in fig 4 locations are shown in fig 1c sites located in different areas have different characteristics of curve sounding the apparent resistivity values of sites 2 7 and 6 21 located in the uranium mine area were 10 ωm at low frequencies 100 hz and decreased as the frequencies decreased fig 4 however for the csamt sites e g sites 7b 12 and 9 3 outside the uranium mine area relatively high apparent resistivity values at all frequencies were noted as shown in fig 4 3 3 2d inversion conventional approaches developed for mt data can be applied to tensor csamt far field data in this study 2d inversion of all lines was performed using the nonlinear conjugate gradient nlcg code described by rodi and mackie 2001 with tm mode data inconsistent data including the anomalous apparent resistivity and phase in fig 4 according to the ρ response parker and booker 1996 were removed by enlarging their errors the initial models were set to uniform half spaces with a topography of 60 ωm as the error floors for apparent resistivity and phase and regularization parameter τ are very important in the nlcg code we selected the appropriate τ value with a series of inversions of different τ values according to the l curve τ 10 is the optimal selection the error floors in the final inversions were set to 10 and 5 for the apparent resistivity and phase respectively a misfit comparison between the observed and calculated data of two typical csamt profiles l3 and l6 is shown in fig 5 and the root mean square rms misfit distribution of all csamt sites is shown in fig 6 these results indicate that the reliability of the final 2d inversion model is high the resistivity distribution of the uranium mining area obtained by the 2d inversion is shown in figs 7 and 8 4 results and discussion geophysical methods were used to detect the spread of groundwater contamination using acid in situ leaching technology to extract uranium in china s xinjian region the inverted electrical resistivity model of the uranium mining site is shown in figs 7 and 8 the interpreted electrical resistivity model shows three distinct zones a a series of low resistivity zones 10 ωm c1 c6 beneath the three mining sites and extending to 950 m above sea level b layers with moderate resistivity 20 50 ωm c7 and c8 on the east and north sides of the uranium mines in lines 3 4b 7b and 8 10 at 1000 1100 m above sea level and c zones with relatively high resistivity 50 ωm r1 r4 covering the top of a and b in the electrical resistivity model the low resistivity zones at the position of the well screen except zone c fig 8c and 8d are consistent with the regions with high sulfuric acid concentration and low ph values fig 9 zone c was still operational at the time of the investigation therefore no samples were collected in this region however the results were not influenced by zone c as this zone was hydraulically isolated by an in situ leaching technique the results revealed that the low resistivity range of 1 to 10 ωm at a depth of 100 120 m and a sulfuric acid concentration range of 2000 30 000 mg l of groundwater with a ph value range of 2 4 reflects the pollution of the aquifer 4 1 connection to petrophysics the resistivity of the contaminant plumes was typically in the range of 1 10 ωm whereas that of the uncontaminated aquifer was generally in the range of 20 50 ωm fig 10 shows some inverted resistivity data of the stratum at the position of the well screen versus the sulfate ion concentration data of the corresponding wells these field data were based on the resistivity grid associated with the wells where the pore water sample used to measure the ion concentration value was located the background sites were uncontaminated groundwater sites located outside the uranium mining area and were characterized by the same strata as the uranium mining area fig 10 displays the two contaminated and uncontaminated strata s resistivity end members in uncontaminated groundwater the resistivity of the stratum is controlled by the surface conductivity along the mineral water interface revil and glover 1998 and the stratum resistivity was in the range of 20 50 ωm the other end member was obtained at high sulfate concentrations in the contaminated aquifer in this case the resistivity is controlled by the ion concentration of pore water merkel 1972 the variation in the sandstone bulk resistivity is not only related to the ion concentration of the pore fluid but is also closely related to the sandstone s porosity to analyze the variation in the contaminated aquifer s porosity the modified archie s law glover et al 2000 was adopted for estimation with a cementation exponent of 1 assuming that the fluid in the sandstone was completely interconnected the modified archie s law is given by 3 σ σ m 1 φ w p σ w φ w n p log 1 φ w n log 1 φ w where σ is the bulk conductivity of the aquifer σm and σw are the conductivities of the matrix rock and pore fluid respectively φw is the porosity and n 1 indicates complete connectivity the average conductivity value of the surrounding rock matrix σm 2 5 10 3 s m ρm 400 ωm obtained from the inversion result was used to estimate the porosity of the aquifer the empirical and theoretical relationships between water conductivity and dissolved ion concentration have been confirmed to exist merkel 1972 yuval and oldenburg 1996 miller and curtin 2006 tycholiz et al 2016 rebello et al 2020 a direct relationship between pore water conductivity and sulfate concentration can also be obtained from empirical results merkel 1972 the empirical relation is given by 4 log σ w 0 602 log so 4 2 0 2907 where σw is the pore water conductivity in ms m and the sulfate concentration is in mg l considering the conductivity of other ions the conductivities of contaminated groundwater and uncontaminated groundwater were selected to be 1 s m and 0 1 s m respectively table 1 fig 11 shows that the porosity of sandstone with uncontaminated groundwater is approximately 18 while the porosity of sandstone located in the uranium mining area s injection well zone increased to approximately 20 which is consistent with the results of the laboratory measurement zeng et al 2021a 2021b the reason for the increase in porosity may be that during the acidic in situ leaching process some carbonate bearing rocks or other minerals such as feldspar and calcite in the sandstone react with sulfuric acid resulting in dissolved minerals and thus altering the permeability of the rock zeng et al 2021b zhao et al 2018 zhao and li 2021 4 2 geometry of the contaminant plumes the electrical resistivity model derived from the csamt data agrees with the well log data from the borehole located on the line and in its vicinity the csamt measures and inverts the resistivity of the subsurface stratum on the surface and detects relatively large scale structural features in contrast a well log measurement is performed within the borehole closer to the target and smaller scale variations in resistivity can be detected fig 12 shows the well log data from the four monitoring boreholes compared with the resistivity values from the final model at the borehole location the length of the well screen of monitor borehole a and b are 8 m and 6 5 m respectively and are located at 1012 1020 m and 1040 1046 5 m above sea level respectively fig 12a the well and log data and the inverted resistivity value of the depth in the well screen of monitor boreholes a and b fig 12 which are located in mining zone b fig 1 were in agreement a low resistivity layer 10 ωm can be found in fig 12a and above the well screen fig 12b which is associated with the migration of leachate originating from uranium mining the electrical resistivity of sandstone is related to rock type porosity temperature of pore water and concentration revil et al 2014 sakuma and ichiki 2016 factors that affect the resistivity of sandstone also include fluid saturation and salinity of the fluid in the pores revil and glover 1998 electrical resistivity largely depends on the fluid content and electrical properties of the fluid in the pores yoon and park 2001 the resistivity of sandstone has a certain distribution range contamination may occur if the deviation is too large pollutants affect the bulk resistivity of sandstone as they change the electrical properties of groundwater the use of sulfuric acid in the aquifer caused a significant change in the ion concentration and ph value of the fluid dong et al 2016 which resulted in a significant decrease in the bulk resistivity of sandstone in the uranium mining area in zone b the resistivity was 10 ωm corresponding to a sulfate concentration of 26 000 mg l the low resistivity zones 10 ωm can be interpreted as contaminant plumes which are mainly caused by the migration of leachate originating from uranium mining fig 13 contaminant plumes are primarily located in the uranium mining area the scale of the contaminant plumes c1 c3 beneath zone c was relatively large due to ongoing uranium mining in zone c during the field investigation in zone c the in situ leach mining operation comprises dozens of in situ leaching units each consisting of five wells with a production well in the center and four surrounding injection wells the distance between each well was 20 30 m sulfuric acid with a concentration of 15 20 g l was injected into the uranium orebody through the injection wells at a flow rate of 10 30 m3 d to accelerate the acidification rate and shorten the acidification time the scale of contaminant plumes c4 and c5 in zones a and b was relatively small as they ceased uranium mining in 1996 and 2009 respectively the results imply one of two possibilities either the contaminants are well confined in the mining site due to the shutdown of the production well or the contaminants migrating down the gradient from the injection well are reduced due to natural attenuation in the aquifer zhu et al 2001 the mean annual precipitation of the yili basin is 240 mm whereas the mean annual evaporation is much higher up to 1600 mm kang et al 2020 the seasonal river runoff near the mine area and the regional average groundwater velocity were very low there was no north south trending fault acting as a preferential groundwater flow pathway in the mining area therefore it is difficult for contaminants to migrate which is supported by the hydrochemical data fig 9 the contaminant plumes c4 and c5 were well confined in the mining area the outer edges of zones a and b are injection wells that create a hydraulic watershed to prevent the migration of contaminants to zones a and b therefore the distribution range of contaminants in zones a and b is much lower due to the natural attenuation of the remaining leach solution the contaminant plume c6 outside the uranium mining area is caused by the leakage and infiltration of solution from the setting pond at a concentration of 5 10 g l fig 13 zhou et al 2020 4 3 electrical properties of uncontaminated aquifers the electrical resistivity model is generally used to determine the properties of aquifers and other subsurface features in the vicinity of the measurement sites the geological structure is complex therefore it is important to describe the depth of the aquifer to determine the migration and characteristics of groundwater contamination the layer with moderate resistivity 20 50 ωm c7 and c8 outside the uranium mining areas in lines 3 4b 7 and 8 10 is interpreted as an uncontaminated aquifer because the resistivity value is consistent with that of a typical aquifer chen et al 2008 maiti et al 2012 mézquita gonzález et al 2021 shang et al 2021 the resistivity model also indicated that the buried depth of the groundwater level was in the range of 20 100 m which is consistent with the observation results from nearby monitoring wells fig 14 the depth of the aquifer in the higher altitude areas is deeper lines 3 and 4b whereas the depth of the aquifer in the valley area is shallower lines 7a and 8 10 the observed tds values of water samples from different monitoring wells outside the uranium mining areas ranged from 310 to 1090 mg l with a mean value of 660 mg l which is lower than the contamination threshold 4 4 high resistances the survey area included many types of sandstones with significant differences in porosity therefore there were noteworthy differences in their electrical properties the stratum in the survey area is composed of mudstone siltstone and sandstone the resistivity of which increases with an increase in grain size and decrease in water content the high resistance zones r1 r4 are likely related to the formation with low moisture content implying lower porosity and ion concentration than the aquifer however the reasons for the low porosity in these high resistance zones were different the low porosity of the high resistance zones r1 and r4 mainly emerged from the original formation process and a general decrease in porosity with increasing compaction resulted in an increase in resistivity with increasing depth r1 and r4 which have poor permeability act as barriers to the migration of contaminants and confine the contaminants to the uranium mining area the concentrations of sulfate and uranium in the uranium mine s hydraulic downstream area monitoring well were 397 mg l and 6 2 μg l respectively dong et al 2016 which is consistent with those in the uncontaminated groundwater indicating that the contaminate plumes did not migrate here although the contaminate plumes are trapped in the confined aquifer beneath the mining area by the surrounding low permeability sandstones field hydrochemical investigations dong et al 2016 and numerical simulations hammond and lichtner 2010 showed that the natural attenuation rate of pollution is quite slow therefore it is necessary to use a variety of methods e g the biological and permeable adsorptive barriers method hu et al 2011 santonastaso et al 2018 for the restoration of contaminated groundwater from in situ leach uranium mining to avoid widespread contamination in the confined aquifer caused by external factors e g mechanical failure human errors a second mechanism is proposed to explain the high resistance zones r2 and r3 beneath the production wells in the uranium mining area when the leaching liquid interacts with the solid phase of the productive horizon large amounts of aluminum and iron ions are generated in the solution when the ph increases ph 3 the aluminum and iron hydroxides minerals of the silica earth group precipitate from solutions as colloid particles forming gels to plug the pore space of the producing formation which may reduce the rock porosity and permeability prevent the infiltration of peripheral groundwater and reduce a large amount of leaching liquid from penetrating the ore body laboratory measurements of plugged rock samples from the production well show that the plugged sandstones are yellow in color and have relatively high contents of fe and chamosite caused by the precipitation of fe oh 3 at a ph of 2 0 4 0 and by the precipitation of gypsum caso4 2h2o with a single tabular crystal and aggregates which are daisy like in shape during acid in situ mining of sandstone uranium deposits zhao and li 2021 precipitation covers the surface of the sandstone grains thus minimizing the size and connectivity of the sandstone pores another physical type of pore plugging is caused by the accumulation of clay particles and micro authigenic quartz derived from the alteration of feldspar in sandstone aquifers zhao et al 2018 5 conclusion the csamt method was used in the uranium mining area located in the yili basin to identify acidic contaminants in the aquifers the resistivity model from the 2d inversion of 10 csamt profiles revealed a laterally and vertically fine image of the subsurface structure including three distinct zones a a series of low resistivity zones b layers with moderate resistivity and c high resistivity zones combined with geological geochemical and well log data the low resistivity zone beneath the uranium mining area is indicative of acid contaminant plume migration which closely coincides with the distribution of sulfate and uranium ions in groundwater the scale of the contaminant plume beneath zone c where uranium mining activities are still ongoing is relatively large whereas the scale of the contaminant plume beneath closed zones a and b is relatively small this result may be caused by pollutants being effectively confined to the mining site or by the natural attenuation of the aquifer the porosity of the sandstone bearing the uranium beneath the injection well zone increased from 18 to 20 because some carbonate bearing rocks or other minerals in the sandstone reacted with sulfuric acid during the acidic in situ leaching process the porosity of the sandstone beneath the production well zone was reduced because of pore plugging caused by the accumulation of clay particles and micro authigenic quartz and by the precipitation of compounds the low permeable sandstones surrounding the aquifer confined the contaminant plume to the uranium mining area and slowed the downstream migration of contaminants credit authorship contribution statement yuanzhi cheng project administration conceptualization methodology

electromagnetic method that uses repetitive artificial signals generated by a grounded dipole or horizontal loop goldstein and strangway 1975 zonge and hughes 1991 di et al 2020 csamt data can be collected in areas with high cultural noise and rough terrain the csamt method is primarily based on the resistivity difference of rocks to detect features of the subsurface electrical structure goldstein and strangway 1975 zonge and hughes 1991 di et al 2020 it has been applied to various exploration problems worldwide including groundwater contamination tweeton et al 1991 sinclair and thompson 2015 he et al 2018 mineral exploration hu et al 2013 guo et al 2020 engineering detection unsworth et al 2000 di et al 2020 fluid monitoring darnet et al 2020 and groundwater surveys wu et al 2012 fu et al 2013 kouadio et al 2020 the resistivity of rock is highly sensitive to its porosity and the salinity of the fluid the depth of the uranium deposits in the yili basin is 100 200 m therefore the csamt method can be used to confirm the porosity change and fluid migration pathway of the rock in contrast to previous works which used only geophysical methods to characterize fluid changes qualitatively he et al 2018 this study combines csamt fluid geochemistry and well log data to image the scale and position of the acid contaminant plumes beneath the uranium mining area to quantitatively identify porosity changes in the sandstone bearing uranium ore 2 geological setting the yili basin fig 1 b in xinjiang is an important uranium deposit in the mesozoic and cenozoic basins and the first mine with in situ leaching of uranium in northern china zhou et al 2020 the uranium deposits are typical interlayer oxidation zones of the sandstone type song et al 2019 the yili basin is a continental depression basin derived from the interaction between the tarim and kazakhstan plates zhang and liu 2019 since the cenozoic the yili basin has been transformed and has reformed the earlier structures by uneven uplifting derived from the yanshan and himalayan movements zhang and liu 2019 the mesozoic and cenozoic strata in the southern slope zone of the yili basin are generally inclined to the north at the angles of 5 8 and are the main distribution locations of sandstone type uranium deposits fig 2 dai et al 2015 zhou et al 2020 the basement of the yili basin is mainly composed of carboniferous permian volcanic sedimentary rocks and precambrian crystalline rocks with a small number of proterozoic granites zhang and liu 2019 the unconformable overlying rocks above the basement are mainly composed of the upper triassic xiaoquangou group the middle and lower jurassic shuixigou group and the cretaceous cenozoic red beds wang et al 2021 the uranium mineralization is mainly distributed in the shuixigou group which consists of a series of fluvial limnological facies coal bearing clastic rocks with well developed sandstone bodies containing abundant organic matters zhou et al 2020 wang et al 2021 the yili basin is an infiltration artesian basin and the topographical features of the basin are high in the south and low in the north multiple aquifers are distributed in the stratum of the mining area all of which are confined aquifers dong et al 2016 the thickness of the aquifer mainly composed of medium grained sandstone and glutenite with good permeability is 10 30 m the water head of the aquifer is the range of 112 150 m and the average velocity of regional groundwater is approximately 0 013 0 029 m d according to field investigation the seasonal water table fluctuation is the range of 2 5 m the flood period is from june to july every year and the maximum flow of the seasonal river near the mining area is 0 09 m3 s after flowing through the mining area the surface water infiltrates and replenishes the quaternary pore water and the change of water level lags behind the surface water flood period by about 4 months there are impermeable layers composed of mudstone siltstone and coal on the top and bottom of the aquifer which makes the upper and lower aquifers form their own systems without hydraulic connection fig 2 dong et al 2016 the qapqal mountain area in the south is a groundwater replenishment area the source of groundwater is bedrock fissure water and atmospheric precipitation which replenishes the ore bearing aquifer through surface runoff and quaternary phreatic water zhou et al 2020 the mining area is in the runoff area of the groundwater with alluvial fan slopes on the surface the thickness of the ore bearing aquifer is 15 25 m and the hydraulic conductivity is estimated at 0 52 1 16 m day dong et al 2016 due to the unconformity contact relationship between the ore bearing aquifer and the overlying aquifer in the process of mining wang et al 2021 with the extraction of groundwater from the ore bearing aquifer the inherent recharge balance relationship with other aquifers and surface water is disturbed making other aquifers and surface water recharge ore bearing aquifer dong et al 2016 before mining activities the mineralization level of the nature groundwater was 0 23 0 69 g l consisting mainly of mg na ca so4 and hco3 and the ph value of the nature groundwater ranged from 7 8 to 8 5 dong et al 2016 zhou et al 2020 the major minerals in the ore bearing aquifer are rock debris 5 carbonaceous material 0 5 clay minerals 40 60 and quartz 30 50 zhou et al 2020 the mining sites were divided into three zones based on the year in which the mining activity started fig 1c zone a started mining in 1992 and was shut down in 1996 zone b started production in 1995 and closed in 2009 zone c was still in production during field investigation during the in situ leaching process of uranium ore an acid solution is injected into a confined ore bearing aquifer through several injection wells and then pumped out dissolved uranium and other chemicals through the extraction well dong et al 2016 the wellbore casing has sufficient integrity to withstand the cementation of the annular space to isolate the leaching zone and not prevent geophysical and hydrological observations during the in situ leaching process zhou et al 2020 the thickness of the ore bearing aquifer beneath the zones a and b was approximately 10 15 m the depth of the uranium deposit is 100 140 m and the length of the screen of the injection and production wells was 5 10 m in the process of uranium mining injection and production wells are used for mixed pumping and high concentration sulfuric acid 15 20 g l is injected into the uranium orebody for an acidification time of 40 45 days 3 method and data 3 1 csamt data acquisition csamt is an artificial source frequency domain electromagnetic method the distance between the two transmitting electrodes ab was 1 2 km the measurement was carried out 6 12 km from the field source which can be approximated as a plane wave at high frequencies fig 3 the electric field ex parallel to ab and the magnetic field hy perpendicular to ab were measured using an electric field dipole and high gain magnetic field coil respectively fig 3 the measurement frequency of csamt is typically in the range of 0 125 8192 hz and the penetration depth is typically up to 2 3 km lateral resolution is typically in the range of 10 200 m depending on the measured dipole length the vertical resolution typically falls in the range of 5 20 of the depth under investigation goldstein and strangway 1975 zonge and hughes 1991 the csamt survey within the uranium mining site consisted of ten survey profiles fig 1c survey arrays with seven 20 meter dipoles and magnetic coils were simultaneously used to collect scalar electric field data and a magnetic field using a zonge gdp 32 ii multifunctional receiver csamt data were recorded at 364 sites 23 frequencies were used ranging from 8192 to 4 hz and were processed to calculate the apparent resistivity and phase the controlled electromagnetic field was generated using a zonge ggt 30 transmitter located 12 km from the uranium mining site the electric dipole s transmitter length which was laid on the sedimentary sequence was 2000 m resulting in a higher attenuation of electromagnetic signals on the path from the transmitter to the receiver this transmitter produced high quality data such that they were interpretable with 2d inversion 3 2 csamt data processing in this survey all csamt data were recorded in the far field thus the apparent resistivity and phase of each site were calculated using the cagniard resistivity from the ratio of the electric field ex to the magnetic field hy cagniard 1953 the cagniard resistivity ρ and phase φ are expressed as follows 1 ρ 1 5 f e x 2 h y 2 φ arctan im e x h y re e x h y where ρ is the apparent resistivity and f is the frequency the distortion effect of the electric field is evident owing to the presence of lateral nonuniformity in the near surface conductivity the static shift effect is caused by charge accumulation at the boundaries of conductive inhomogeneities and the inability to distinguish small inhomogeneous bodies in the shallow layer which leads to a fictitious subsurface structure and an incorrect geological interpretation jones 1988 groom and bailey 1989 jiracek 1990 in this study the hanning window spatial filter method was used to eliminate the static effect torres verdín and bostick 1992 because the csamt data in the survey were continuous measurements along each profile the hanning window in the spatial filter is expressed as follows 2 h x 1 w 1 cos 2 π x w x w 2 0 x w 2 where is the filter length and w is the width of the hanning window h x is applied at seven points the typical apparent resistivity and phase curves of the four csamt sites are shown in fig 4 locations are shown in fig 1c sites located in different areas have different characteristics of curve sounding the apparent resistivity values of sites 2 7 and 6 21 located in the uranium mine area were 10 ωm at low frequencies 100 hz and decreased as the frequencies decreased fig 4 however for the csamt sites e g sites 7b 12 and 9 3 outside the uranium mine area relatively high apparent resistivity values at all frequencies were noted as shown in fig 4 3 3 2d inversion conventional approaches developed for mt data can be applied to tensor csamt far field data in this study 2d inversion of all lines was performed using the nonlinear conjugate gradient nlcg code described by rodi and mackie 2001 with tm mode data inconsistent data including the anomalous apparent resistivity and phase in fig 4 according to the ρ response parker and booker 1996 were removed by enlarging their errors the initial models were set to uniform half spaces with a topography of 60 ωm as the error floors for apparent resistivity and phase and regularization parameter τ are very important in the nlcg code we selected the appropriate τ value with a series of inversions of different τ values according to the l curve τ 10 is the optimal selection the error floors in the final inversions were set to 10 and 5 for the apparent resistivity and phase respectively a misfit comparison between the observed and calculated data of two typical csamt profiles l3 and l6 is shown in fig 5 and the root mean square rms misfit distribution of all csamt sites is shown in fig 6 these results indicate that the reliability of the final 2d inversion model is high the resistivity distribution of the uranium mining area obtained by the 2d inversion is shown in figs 7 and 8 4 results and discussion geophysical methods were used to detect the spread of groundwater contamination using acid in situ leaching technology to extract uranium in china s xinjian region the inverted electrical resistivity model of the uranium mining site is shown in figs 7 and 8 the interpreted electrical resistivity model shows three distinct zones a a series of low resistivity zones 10 ωm c1 c6 beneath the three mining sites and extending to 950 m above sea level b layers with moderate resistivity 20 50 ωm c7 and c8 on the east and north sides of the uranium mines in lines 3 4b 7b and 8 10 at 1000 1100 m above sea level and c zones with relatively high resistivity 50 ωm r1 r4 covering the top of a and b in the electrical resistivity model the low resistivity zones at the position of the well screen except zone c fig 8c and 8d are consistent with the regions with high sulfuric acid concentration and low ph values fig 9 zone c was still operational at the time of the investigation therefore no samples were collected in this region however the results were not influenced by zone c as this zone was hydraulically isolated by an in situ leaching technique the results revealed that the low resistivity range of 1 to 10 ωm at a depth of 100 120 m and a sulfuric acid concentration range of 2000 30 000 mg l of groundwater with a ph value range of 2 4 reflects the pollution of the aquifer 4 1 connection to petrophysics the resistivity of the contaminant plumes was typically in the range of 1 10 ωm whereas that of the uncontaminated aquifer was generally in the range of 20 50 ωm fig 10 shows some inverted resistivity data of the stratum at the position of the well screen versus the sulfate ion concentration data of the corresponding wells these field data were based on the resistivity grid associated with the wells where the pore water sample used to measure the ion concentration value was located the background sites were uncontaminated groundwater sites located outside the uranium mining area and were characterized by the same strata as the uranium mining area fig 10 displays the two contaminated and uncontaminated strata s resistivity end members in uncontaminated groundwater the resistivity of the stratum is controlled by the surface conductivity along the mineral water interface revil and glover 1998 and the stratum resistivity was in the range of 20 50 ωm the other end member was obtained at high sulfate concentrations in the contaminated aquifer in this case the resistivity is controlled by the ion concentration of pore water merkel 1972 the variation in the sandstone bulk resistivity is not only related to the ion concentration of the pore fluid but is also closely related to the sandstone s porosity to analyze the variation in the contaminated aquifer s porosity the modified archie s law glover et al 2000 was adopted for estimation with a cementation exponent of 1 assuming that the fluid in the sandstone was completely interconnected the modified archie s law is given by 3 σ σ m 1 φ w p σ w φ w n p log 1 φ w n log 1 φ w where σ is the bulk conductivity of the aquifer σm and σw are the conductivities of the matrix rock and pore fluid respectively φw is the porosity and n 1 indicates complete connectivity the average conductivity value of the surrounding rock matrix σm 2 5 10 3 s m ρm 400 ωm obtained from the inversion result was used to estimate the porosity of the aquifer the empirical and theoretical relationships between water conductivity and dissolved ion concentration have been confirmed to exist merkel 1972 yuval and oldenburg 1996 miller and curtin 2006 tycholiz et al 2016 rebello et al 2020 a direct relationship between pore water conductivity and sulfate concentration can also be obtained from empirical results merkel 1972 the empirical relation is given by 4 log σ w 0 602 log so 4 2 0 2907 where σw is the pore water conductivity in ms m and the sulfate concentration is in mg l considering the conductivity of other ions the conductivities of contaminated groundwater and uncontaminated groundwater were selected to be 1 s m and 0 1 s m respectively table 1 fig 11 shows that the porosity of sandstone with uncontaminated groundwater is approximately 18 while the porosity of sandstone located in the uranium mining area s injection well zone increased to approximately 20 which is consistent with the results of the laboratory measurement zeng et al 2021a 2021b the reason for the increase in porosity may be that during the acidic in situ leaching process some carbonate bearing rocks or other minerals such as feldspar and calcite in the sandstone react with sulfuric acid resulting in dissolved minerals and thus altering the permeability of the rock zeng et al 2021b zhao et al 2018 zhao and li 2021 4 2 geometry of the contaminant plumes the electrical resistivity model derived from the csamt data agrees with the well log data from the borehole located on the line and in its vicinity the csamt measures and inverts the resistivity of the subsurface stratum on the surface and detects relatively large scale structural features in contrast a well log measurement is performed within the borehole closer to the target and smaller scale variations in resistivity can be detected fig 12 shows the well log data from the four monitoring boreholes compared with the resistivity values from the final model at the borehole location the length of the well screen of monitor borehole a and b are 8 m and 6 5 m respectively and are located at 1012 1020 m and 1040 1046 5 m above sea level respectively fig 12a the well and log data and the inverted resistivity value of the depth in the well screen of monitor boreholes a and b fig 12 which are located in mining zone b fig 1 were in agreement a low resistivity layer 10 ωm can be found in fig 12a and above the well screen fig 12b which is associated with the migration of leachate originating from uranium mining the electrical resistivity of sandstone is related to rock type porosity temperature of pore water and concentration revil et al 2014 sakuma and ichiki 2016 factors that affect the resistivity of sandstone also include fluid saturation and salinity of the fluid in the pores revil and glover 1998 electrical resistivity largely depends on the fluid content and electrical properties of the fluid in the pores yoon and park 2001 the resistivity of sandstone has a certain distribution range contamination may occur if the deviation is too large pollutants affect the bulk resistivity of sandstone as they change the electrical properties of groundwater the use of sulfuric acid in the aquifer caused a significant change in the ion concentration and ph value of the fluid dong et al 2016 which resulted in a significant decrease in the bulk resistivity of sandstone in the uranium mining area in zone b the resistivity was 10 ωm corresponding to a sulfate concentration of 26 000 mg l the low resistivity zones 10 ωm can be interpreted as contaminant plumes which are mainly caused by the migration of leachate originating from uranium mining fig 13 contaminant plumes are primarily located in the uranium mining area the scale of the contaminant plumes c1 c3 beneath zone c was relatively large due to ongoing uranium mining in zone c during the field investigation in zone c the in situ leach mining operation comprises dozens of in situ leaching units each consisting of five wells with a production well in the center and four surrounding injection wells the distance between each well was 20 30 m sulfuric acid with a concentration of 15 20 g l was injected into the uranium orebody through the injection wells at a flow rate of 10 30 m3 d to accelerate the acidification rate and shorten the acidification time the scale of contaminant plumes c4 and c5 in zones a and b was relatively small as they ceased uranium mining in 1996 and 2009 respectively the results imply one of two possibilities either the contaminants are well confined in the mining site due to the shutdown of the production well or the contaminants migrating down the gradient from the injection well are reduced due to natural attenuation in the aquifer zhu et al 2001 the mean annual precipitation of the yili basin is 240 mm whereas the mean annual evaporation is much higher up to 1600 mm kang et al 2020 the seasonal river runoff near the mine area and the regional average groundwater velocity were very low there was no north south trending fault acting as a preferential groundwater flow pathway in the mining area therefore it is difficult for contaminants to migrate which is supported by the hydrochemical data fig 9 the contaminant plumes c4 and c5 were well confined in the mining area the outer edges of zones a and b are injection wells that create a hydraulic watershed to prevent the migration of contaminants to zones a and b therefore the distribution range of contaminants in zones a and b is much lower due to the natural attenuation of the remaining leach solution the contaminant plume c6 outside the uranium mining area is caused by the leakage and infiltration of solution from the setting pond at a concentration of 5 10 g l fig 13 zhou et al 2020 4 3 electrical properties of uncontaminated aquifers the electrical resistivity model is generally used to determine the properties of aquifers and other subsurface features in the vicinity of the measurement sites the geological structure is complex therefore it is important to describe the depth of the aquifer to determine the migration and characteristics of groundwater contamination the layer with moderate resistivity 20 50 ωm c7 and c8 outside the uranium mining areas in lines 3 4b 7 and 8 10 is interpreted as an uncontaminated aquifer because the resistivity value is consistent with that of a typical aquifer chen et al 2008 maiti et al 2012 mézquita gonzález et al 2021 shang et al 2021 the resistivity model also indicated that the buried depth of the groundwater level was in the range of 20 100 m which is consistent with the observation results from nearby monitoring wells fig 14 the depth of the aquifer in the higher altitude areas is deeper lines 3 and 4b whereas the depth of the aquifer in the valley area is shallower lines 7a and 8 10 the observed tds values of water samples from different monitoring wells outside the uranium mining areas ranged from 310 to 1090 mg l with a mean value of 660 mg l which is lower than the contamination threshold 4 4 high resistances the survey area included many types of sandstones with significant differences in porosity therefore there were noteworthy differences in their electrical properties the stratum in the survey area is composed of mudstone siltstone and sandstone the resistivity of which increases with an increase in grain size and decrease in water content the high resistance zones r1 r4 are likely related to the formation with low moisture content implying lower porosity and ion concentration than the aquifer however the reasons for the low porosity in these high resistance zones were different the low porosity of the high resistance zones r1 and r4 mainly emerged from the original formation process and a general decrease in porosity with increasing compaction resulted in an increase in resistivity with increasing depth r1 and r4 which have poor permeability act as barriers to the migration of contaminants and confine the contaminants to the uranium mining area the concentrations of sulfate and uranium in the uranium mine s hydraulic downstream area monitoring well were 397 mg l and 6 2 μg l respectively dong et al 2016 which is consistent with those in the uncontaminated groundwater indicating that the contaminate plumes did not migrate here although the contaminate plumes are trapped in the confined aquifer beneath the mining area by the surrounding low permeability sandstones field hydrochemical investigations dong et al 2016 and numerical simulations hammond and lichtner 2010 showed that the natural attenuation rate of pollution is quite slow therefore it is necessary to use a variety of methods e g the biological and permeable adsorptive barriers method hu et al 2011 santonastaso et al 2018 for the restoration of contaminated groundwater from in situ leach uranium mining to avoid widespread contamination in the confined aquifer caused by external factors e g mechanical failure human errors a second mechanism is proposed to explain the high resistance zones r2 and r3 beneath the production wells in the uranium mining area when the leaching liquid interacts with the solid phase of the productive horizon large amounts of aluminum and iron ions are generated in the solution when the ph increases ph 3 the aluminum and iron hydroxides minerals of the silica earth group precipitate from solutions as colloid particles forming gels to plug the pore space of the producing formation which may reduce the rock porosity and permeability prevent the infiltration of peripheral groundwater and reduce a large amount of leaching liquid from penetrating the ore body laboratory measurements of plugged rock samples from the production well show that the plugged sandstones are yellow in color and have relatively high contents of fe and chamosite caused by the precipitation of fe oh 3 at a ph of 2 0 4 0 and by the precipitation of gypsum caso4 2h2o with a single tabular crystal and aggregates which are daisy like in shape during acid in situ mining of sandstone uranium deposits zhao and li 2021 precipitation covers the surface of the sandstone grains thus minimizing the size and connectivity of the sandstone pores another physical type of pore plugging is caused by the accumulation of clay particles and micro authigenic quartz derived from the alteration of feldspar in sandstone aquifers zhao et al 2018 5 conclusion the csamt method was used in the uranium mining area located in the yili basin to identify acidic contaminants in the aquifers the resistivity model from the 2d inversion of 10 csamt profiles revealed a laterally and vertically fine image of the subsurface structure including three distinct zones a a series of low resistivity zones b layers with moderate resistivity and c high resistivity zones combined with geological geochemical and well log data the low resistivity zone beneath the uranium mining area is indicative of acid contaminant plume migration which closely coincides with the distribution of sulfate and uranium ions in groundwater the scale of the contaminant plume beneath zone c where uranium mining activities are still ongoing is relatively large whereas the scale of the contaminant plume beneath closed zones a and b is relatively small this result may be caused by pollutants being effectively confined to the mining site or by the natural attenuation of the aquifer the porosity of the sandstone bearing the uranium beneath the injection well zone increased from 18 to 20 because some carbonate bearing rocks or other minerals in the sandstone reacted with sulfuric acid during the acidic in situ leaching process the porosity of the sandstone beneath the production well zone was reduced because of pore plugging caused by the accumulation of clay particles and micro authigenic quartz and by the precipitation of compounds the low permeable sandstones surrounding the aquifer confined the contaminant plume to the uranium mining area and slowed the downstream migration of contaminants credit authorship contribution statement yuanzhi cheng project administration conceptualization methodology

3356,accurate estimation of precipitation over the qinghai tibet plateau tp remains a challenge at high spatio temporal scales this research proposed a machine learning ml framework based on multi source products which was involved with seasonal precipitation characteristics and terrain factors to improve the spatio temporal accuracy of precipitation and hydrology simulations in the yalong river basin on the southeastern edge of the tp the main conclusions and results include but were not limited to 1 the ml model based on terrain factors and seasonal precipitation characteristics can wisely integrate multi precision and multi source precipitation products of different resolutions and different time scales indicating that the merge model is robust and has a good generalization ability 2 based on measured gauges the proposed merge model improved the accuracy of precipitation products the pearson s correlation coefficient r increased from 0 52 to 0 84 and root mean square error rmse had been compressed from 5 5 mm day to 1 99 mm day and the spatial distribution of precipitation in regions with few measured gauges was corrected 3 the accuracy of long series product obtained by merge model can be used to evaluate from the perspective of hydrological simulation the method proposed in this study may be helpful to greatly improve the temporal and spatial accuracy of precipitation in high latitude areas with complex terrain and was committed to the study of hydrological cycle keywords precipitation machine learning multi source products a merge model improving precision 1 introduction precipitation is an important dynamic input for the model to study the hydrological cycle system in a basin or region and it is one of the most important basic data for studying water resources niu et al 2017 dong et al 2020 however the spatio temporal variation of precipitation is quite different and limited by some geographical environments so it is difficult to comprehensively promote the global precipitation measurement especially in the qinghai tibet plateau with high spatio temporal scale gat and airey 2006 gebregiorgis and hossain 2012 ma et al 2018 zhu et al 2021 at present the sources of precipitation data and merged precipitation products are mainly ground rain gauge data radar monitoring data and satellite retrieval data lyu et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 the ground rain gauge has high accuracy in monitoring precipitation but it is less distributed in plateau mountain desert and other areas and even does not exist in uninhabited areas at the same time the rain gauge data is precipitation of point and the precipitation distribution obtained by interpolating the rain gauge data has a large error which can not better reflect the spatial variation characteristics of precipitation compared with others kidd et al 2017 shen et al 2018 radar monitoring precipitation has certain accuracy and can obtain precipitation information in a large range however due to the complexity of its own technology such as terrain occlusion and the influence of reflection change factors the error of radar monitoring precipitation is caused and in a large range with the accuracy of radar monitoring can not meet the business requirements compared with the former two satellite precipitation products have the advantages of higher temporal and spatial resolution however their accuracy is still affected by the accuracy of remote sensing retrieval algorithms and numerical prediction models therefore the data is also difficult to apply to the hydrological simulation of the certain basin directly shen et al 2010 maggioni et al 2017 tang et al 2020 now using the hereinbefore precipitation products for multi source merge is currently the mainstream way to improve precipitation accuracy including spatial interpolation deviation correction machine learning ml and weighted average tang et al 2018 zhu et al 2021 among them spatial interpolation can improve the spatial continuity of the measured gauge data but it is more sensitive to the density of the gauge network and cannot interpolate multiple sets of precipitation products at the same time deviation correction can effectively improve the inherent error of the precipitation product when the reference data is complete but it is easy to cause the error of the reference data to propagate to the final correction data due to the excessive correction of the parameters and it is worth noting this method is less robust when calibrating multiple sets of precipitation products the weighted average method mainly uses precipitation related variables to allocate the weight of the multi source precipitation product but the weight allocation is easily affected by factitious empirical strategies in addition it is worth mentioning that most of the hereinbefore methods are based on mathematical equations and there are many untenable assumptions however the current mainstream method of machine learning is powerful and can extract high dimensional non linear relationships into implicit expressions between precipitation products of different sources and different precisions so as to obtain high precision merge precipitation lecun et al 2015 shen et al 2017 for example tao et al 2016 proposed a deep neural network framework to reduce the deviation and false alarm of satellite cloud images after calibrating persiann cc in the central united states it was found the average deviation was reduced by 88 and the false alarm of 38 percent of grids was reduced to improve the accuracy of short term precipitation forecasts qiu et al 2017 used a multi task convolutional neural network to extract the correlation between time series and stations to predict precipitation the results showed that compared with the product of european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf the correlation coefficient between final precipitation product and observed precipitation increased from 0 3 to 0 6 wu et al 2020 used convolutional neural network and long short term memory network to explore the spatio temporal relationship among satellite precipitation measured sites and thermal infrared images while merging them at the same time finally a merged dataset of daily precipitation in china from 2001 to 2005 was obtained which had a higher resolution of 0 05 and a higher accuracy nourani et al 2020 proposed a framework based on a two stage model of artificial intelligence ensemble and spatial interpolation which used different scenario combinations to build the temporal model of 7precipitation gauges located at northern cyprus so as to improve the precision of the model and obtain the precipitation of the whole region through spatial modeling the overall results show that the combination of temporal and spatial modeling tools could simulate the precipitation appropriately by serving unique features of both tools zhang et al 2021 introduced multiple cloud attributes soil moisture and etc to improve the early run of the integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm imerg from 2015 to 2018 based on four types of ml methods the comprehensive root mean square error was reduced by 60 based on the hereinbefore research we firstly found the current research is mainly devoted to the improvement of the method which makes the merge model more complicated however the accuracy of the basic data remained the same even if the more high dimensional and more complex method is adopted the increase in accuracy of the result is minimal in addition most research was still focused on areas with dense rainfall gauges or plains with single climatic conditions finally we found the time series of multi source precipitation products used in most of the studies devoted to improving the accuracy were short and their accuracy and practicability were not evaluated from the perspective of hydrological application tao et al 2016 qiu et al 2017 wu et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 zhu et al 2021 inspired by the hereinbefore research our main purposes were as follows 1 on the basis of exploring the relationship between interpretable environmental factors and precipitation in the basin we used the principal component analysis pca method to screen and extract the principal components of terrain factors and explored seasonal characteristic variables in combination with the law of precipitation in the study area 2 introducing the hereinbefore seasonal characteristics and terrain factors a multi source and multi temporal spatial scale precipitation merge model was constructed based on machine learning 3 exploring the applicability of multi source merged precipitation msmp in areas with insufficient data such as the qinghai tibet plateau from the two aspects of precipitation accuracy evaluation and the practicability of hydrological cycle effect 2 study area and data method 2 1 introduction of the study area the yalong river is a tributary of the upper reaches of the yangtze river which is a typical mountain river it is located on the eastern edge of the qinghai tibet plateau surrounded by mountains above 4000 m above sea level on the east west and north sides fig 1 the elevation of the yalong river on the south side is relatively low about 2000 m zhao et al 2021a b the yalong river basin yrb belongs to the western sichuan plateau climate zone the multi annual average precipitation in the entire basin is 800 1100 mm but the spatio temporal distribution during the intra annual is extremely uneven in terms of space affected by topographic conditions the distribution of precipitation in the basin shows a decreasing trend from southeast to northwest inland in terms of time due to the influence of the summer monsoon the heavy precipitation is mainly concentrated from june to september of which the frequency is the highest from july to august it is precisely the above mentioned topographical and climatic characteristics that have led to the scarcity and dispersion of measured precipitation gauges in the yrb which also makes the accuracy of some precipitation products in the region not high zhao et al 2021a b 2 2 data to ensure the exploration of hydrological effects in region with few or no data the length and integrity of time series about

source merge precipitation machine learning model based on seasonal characteristics and terrain factors hereinafter referred to as mmpmlm proposed by this study was shown in fig 2 the ml models involved in mmpmlm were described in detail in section 2 3 1 and the modeling steps of mmpmlm were elaborated in section 2 3 2 2 3 1 machine learning extreme gradient boosting naive bayesian and multi layer perceptron were selected as the basic algorithms of this research framework from the perspective of the complexity and application of ml the advantages and principles of each ml were as follows 1 extreme gradient boosting xgb xgb or extreme gradient boosting was proposed by chen tianqi of the university of washington in 2016 and published at the 22nd acm sigkdd international conference on knowledge discovery and data mining xgb is mainly built based on the gradient boosting decision tree gbdt algorithm and uses ensemble learning to optimize a single weak predictor to improve the accuracy of prediction and achieve fast calculations chen et al 2016 the main idea is to continuously perform feature splitting on the existing trees and each new tree generated is based on the residual and predicted value of the previous tree as input in this way by adding the tree back and forth and giving higher weights to the incorrectly labeled samples in the previous training finally a better regression or classification performance is obtained and the purpose of reducing the loss function is achieved assuming that there are k trees in the xgb ensemble model the prediction result of the model on the i t h sample is 1 m i k i k k f k n i among them k represents the k t h tree k represents the total number of trees in the ensemble model m i k represents the sum of weights of all leaf nodes of k trees that is the prediction results finally returned by xgboost model n i is the i t h predicted sample f k n i is the weight returned by the node after the i t h sample is input into the k t h tree that is the result the training objective function includes its own loss function and the regularization term added to prevent over fitting 2 o b j θ i 1 k l m i m i k 1 k ω f k 3 ω f k γ t 1 2 λ w 2 among them l m i m i is the training error between the true value and the predicted value of the sample n i that is the corresponding loss function ω f k is the regularization penalty term of the k t h tree to prevent overfitting t represents the number of leaf nodes of the tree w represents the predicted value on each node 2 naive bayesian nb the full name of nb is naive bayesian which was first proposed by duda and hart 1973 it is based on the bayes theorem in statistics and the algorithm is simple and has a stable classification effect in the bayes theorem let h be a kind of hypothesis the data sample series is x c the label of x is unknown and c is a specific class it can be obtained p h x is the probability that the h hypothesis is established under the condition of a given sample x that is the posterior probability of h under condition x conversely p x h can also be obtained as the posterior probability of x under the condition h the p h p x and p x h involved in the above theory can be calculated according to the given data 4 p h x p h p x h p x the hereinbefore is an introduction to bayesian theory and nb is based on the theory and it contains an assumption that each attribute is independent and unrelated to each other the specific nb theory is as follows i first for each data sample extract its corresponding n dimensional feature vector and use x x 1 x 2 x n to describe n metrics for n samples of attributes a 1 a 2 a n ii secondly given an unknown sample data set x predict which category x belongs to among c 1 c 2 c m based on the highest posterior probability if and only if p c i x p c j x 1 j m j i that is to maximize the posterior probability p c i x p x c i p c i p x the classifier will label the sample as c i based on the calculation result iii in the above second step of calculation if the data set has more attributes the amount of calculation for p x c i is larger at this time assume that the class conditions are independent of each other given the sample class label assume that the attribute values are independent of each other and have different sources that is p x c i k i n p x k c i where p x k c i can be estimated from training samples iv for the classification of the unknown sample x calculate p x c i p c i for the class c i if and only if p x c i p c i p x c j p c j 1 j m j i x c i that is x is classified as the largest class c i in p x c i p c i the objective function of the nb is as follows 5 o b j x m a x p c i 1 n p x i c 3 multi layer perceptron mlp mlp is a multilayer perceptron fully known as multi layer perceptron its principle is clear simple and easy to use it is the most widely used artificial neural network structure at present mlp includes an input an output and hidden layers in between each layer has a certain number of neurons the input layer is mainly used to receive external information to activate the neural network structure and does not participate in calculations the hidden layers receive information from the input layer and extract features and finally the output layer outputs the final result according to the different weights of the hidden layer neural unit and its own bias hampshire and pearlmutter 1991 take the simplest mlp with one hidden layer as an example the input data of the input layer is 6 x x 1 x 2 x i x n t input of the i t h neuron in the first

and terrain factors mmpmlm introduced terrain factors and seasonal characteristics of precipitation on the basis of adopting ml model as the feature to construct the final model the main processing and operation of the mmpmlm model included in the following steps 1 screening and extraction of multi source precipitation data 2 pre processing of multi source precipitation products and measured gauge data 3 extraction and pretreatment of terrain factor 4 extraction and pretreatment of seasonal characteristic attributes of precipitation 5 processing of features at no label grid samples 6 stacking modeling with the model as a feature the specific operation details of each step were as follows 1 screening and extraction of multi source precipitation data to improve the accuracy of precipitation in no measured data areas and considering the temporal and spatial consistency of precipitation we selected four types of precipitation products with different sources and resolutions see sec 2 2 for details of precipitation products according to the geographical location of 19 gauges in yrb the data of each precipitation product at the location of each gauge were extracted and processed into daily time series the precipitation products of aph era5 and chi were processed and sorted into daily raster data and har was transformed into daily raster data after corresponding projection conversion 2 pre processing of multi source precipitation products and measured gauge data firstly the daily precipitation data of 19 gauges and the extracted daily data of each product were standardized to make them in the range of 0 to 1 which can avoid model instability caused by the excessive fluctuation of the data set in addition dimensionless data was helpful for the rapid convergence of the model it should be noted that due to the large number of zero value in the daily precipitation data it had an impact on the tail of the data distribution of the training set and the validation set therefore to ensure the feature consistency between the training and validation set the characteristic values of the corresponding training set were used when the test set was normalized 11 x norm x x min x max x min where x was the precipitation value of certain series x min and x max was the minimum and maximum values in the series respectively 3 extraction and pretreatment of terrain factor in this study combined methods of yin et al 2008 and the conditions of actual topographic in the yrb 22 terrain factors were selected as shown in table 1 and pca was used to eliminate redundant information firstly the geographical statistical analysis of 19 meteorological gauges in the yrb showed that 25 km was a more suitable distance for extracting terrain factor samples therefore a buffer zone with a radius of 12 5 km was constructed for each measured gauge and each terrain factor within the sample range were extracted based on 90 m high precision dem data the terrain factors were not independent of each other and the data was redundant therefore pca was used to reduce the dimensionality of multiple attributes and effective terrain factor information can be extracted on the basis of retaining most attribute features as input for subsequent msmp correction it can be seen from table 2 that the four principal components had explained 88 53 of the variance percentage that is the four principal components can basically reflect the main characteristics of multiple terrain factors in the yrb the terrain factors that had a greater impact on the first principal component were elevation mean elevation and median elevation which clearly reflected the influence of altitude in the yrb the terrain factors that had a greater impact on the second principal component were area occupied by east southern western and northern aspect which reflected the influence of aspect similarly the terrain factors that had a great impact on the third and fourth principal components were mean hillshade standard deviation of relative surface fluctuation and longitude latitude which reflected the influence of terrain and geographical location respectively finally the coefficients of the four principal component factors corresponding to each gauge were calculated based on the eigenvalues and the corresponding principal component values were obtained 4 extraction and pretreatment of seasonal characteristic attributes of precipitation precipitation data are time series dependent especially in regions with distinct climatic characteristics the average daily precipitation was defined as the ratio of the cumulative precipitation to the number of days during the study period to obtain the seasonal characteristic attributes of precipitation the average daily precipitation of 19 measured gauges in four seasons was calculated and then the precipitation in four seasons was standardized according to step 2 after processing the precipitation data of each gauge 148 standardized data can be obtained corresponding to one gauge that was each one gauge corresponded to four seasonal characteristic values for each year and the time range was from 1981 to 2017 when used as the feature of ml in the follow up the application was as follows for example for the measured gauge x x stood for any one gauge the daily data from march 1 to may 31 1981 corresponded to only one seasonal characteristic feature that was the spring characteristic value similarly the daily data of gauge x from june 1 1981 to august 31 1981 corresponded to only one seasonal characteristic feature that was the summer characteristic value 5 processing of features at no label grid samples to merge the daily scale multi source grid precipitation data the resolutions of the four precipitation products were aligned into 0 25 the yrb was divided into 250 grids of 0 25 0 25 in total and the same pretreatment of dimensionless standardization was performed for the precipitation product data in each grid according to step 2 in each grid the terrain factors were extracted according to the method of step 3 and the same postprocessing was performed on these factors finally based on the measured gauges to divide yrb into sub regions by thiessen polygon fig 3 and the daily surface precipitation data in each sub region was obtained then according to the time division of the four seasons the daily average value of the areal precipitation in each season in sub region was calculated and the obtained time series of the areal precipitation in the four seasons were also standardized then the seasonal characteristic attributes in each sub region calculated based on the thiessen polygon were assigned to the 0 25 grids which were contained in the sub region it should be noted here that if a 0 25 grid located in multiple sub regions calculate the proportion of the grid in each sub region and select the seasonal feature attribute in the sub region with the largest proportion 6 stacking modeling with the model as a feature to avoid generalization errors in single machine learning the multi ensemble model used a single machine learning model as an input feature was used to improve the accuracy of msmp by learning the learned features to quickly reach the optimum when a new task arrived that is stacking the stacking method introduced here is slightly different it is to integrate a mass of models namely base classifier while the integration of other ml was composed of multiple internal decision trees in brief stacking is to train multiple different models first and then train the next model with the output of each previously trained model as input to obtain the only one final output result here stacking was divided into two layers in our research the first layer included xgb and nb model and the second layer only included mlp model the specific methods were as follows due to different period of each precipitation product the merge process was divided into three periods namely 1981 1999 2000 2014 and 2015 2017 here we used period from 1981to 1999 as an example to elaborate after pre processing the multi source precipitation data terrain factors and seasonal characteristics to obtain features of each sample the data set was divided into two sets training set and test set the training set were the daily samples of 19 observed gauges from 1981 to 1999 and the test set was the daily samples of 238 grids from 1981 to 1999 after removing 12 observed gauges included in the basin fig 3 the features of each sample in the two data sets included three types of precipitation products terrain factors and seasonal characteristics that is to say the input of xgb or nb included three precipitation products aph era5 and chi four principal components of terrain factors and seasonal characteristic attributes of precipitation after processing the training set was divided into 4 parts according to the spatial distribution of the measured gauges as shown in fig 3 namely t r a i n 1 t r a i n 2 t r a i n 3 and t r a i n 4 and each of them contained daily sample data of 5 4 5 5 gauges from 1981 to 1999 respectively for each base classifier in the first layer use t r a i n 1 t r a i n 2 t r a i n 3 and t r a i n 4 to do the four fold cross check in turn and make predictions on the test set at the same time as each cross check in this way the base classifier will finally output 4 parts of predicted values on the entire training set namely p r e t r a i n 1 p r e t r a i n 2 p r e t r a i n 3 and p r e t r a i n 4 it can be found that the longitudinal superposition of the four parts of predicted values was the predicted value of the whole training set which was recorded as a 1 for the 4 parts of predicted values output from the test set we took the average postscript as b 1 similarly perform the hereinbefore operation steps for another base classifier in the first layer to obtain a 2 and b 2 finally the predicted values a 1 and a 2 obtained by the two base classifiers of the first layer based on the training set were used as features of the model in the next layer after training the model in the second layer prediction was made based on b 1 and b 2 after merging the precipitation from 1981 to 1999 continue to do the same treatment for the periods from 2000 to 2014 and 2015 to 2017 finally the median filter method was used to ensure the smoothness of the msmp at the junction of the three time periods it was worth mentioning here that the number of precipitation products in the sample features was different in three different periods 2 4 evaluation indices in this study referring to the previous literatures zhang et al 2021 zhu et al 2021 ml based algorithms were evaluated from the two aspects of numerical accuracy and classification evaluation root mean square error rmse was used to reflect the quantitative consistency which represented the deviation between precipitation products and measured precipitation and it was also sensitive to large or small errors in measurement which can well reflect the precision of measurement the value range of rmse was 0 when it was 0 it meant there was no difference at all in addition pearson correlation coefficient r was also introduced on the basis of rmse see eq 12 to synchronously evaluate the simulation accuracy of precipitation from the aspect of numerical accuracy the calculation formulas were as follows 12 r m s e 1 n i 1 n w i c i 2 13 r i 1 n w i w c i c i 1 n w i w 2 i 1 n c i c 2 where w i represented daily precipitation data of various products c i represented the measured daily precipitation data i 1 2 n n w a s t h e t o t a l n u m b e r o f d a y s o f t h e s a m p l e w a n d c represented the average value of various precipitation products and measured precipitation respectively in terms of classification evaluation the critical success index csi probability of detection pod and false alarm ratio far were used to evaluate the daily monitoring ability of precipitation products csi represented the probability of successfully predicting a precipitation event and the value range was 0 1 and closer it was to 1 the higher the success probability was pod indicated the retrieval hit rate for each precipitation event with a value range of 0 1 which the value of 1 indicated the hit rate was 100 and 0 indicated the retrieval was completely wrong far represent the probability that the precipitation product make an error in the prediction of real precipitation events the value range was 0 1 and the larger the value the higher the probability of error the calculation formulas were as follows 14 c s i n 11 n 11 n 10 n 01 15 p o d n 11 n 11 n 01 16 f a r n 10 n 11 n 10 among them n 11 n 01 n 10 was defined in table 3 in which the threshold for judging whether there was rain can be set by user itself generally 0 1 mm in addition to verify whether the runoff obtained by the msmp can be used as future forecast results nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nash in hydrology nilawar and waikar 2018 nourani et al 2021 was additionally introduced on the basis of r see eq 13 and rmse see eq 12 to evaluate the runoff simulation accuracy 17 nash 1 i 1 n q sim i q obs i 2 i 1 n q obs i q obs 2 where q sim i is the simulated runoff q obs i is measured runoff q obs is the average value of the measured runoff 3 result 3 1 statistical precision of msmp and multi source precipitation products based on measured gauges calculating the statistical performance indices of msmp and four multi source precipitation products to verify the robustness and generalization of mmpmlm firstly the accuracy of aph from 1981 to 2014 era5 and chi from 1981 to 2017 and har data from 2000 to 2017 were evaluated based on the measured gauge data by analyzing the daily series of four precipitation products the r rmse between aph chi era5 har and the measured daily precipitation were obtained as shown in table 4 the r of the overall four types of precipitation were between 0 36 and 0 78 in which the correlation between aph and measured data was the highest and the correlation between har and measured data was the lowest judging by the rmse it can be seen there was no large or small error between the four precipitation products and the measured data and the dispersion between the whole and the measured precipitation was small in terms of classification evaluation aph and har were the best with csi pod and far of 0 63 095 0 34 and 0 52 0 88 0 44 respectively era5 was the second and chi performed the worst with csi pod and far of 0 48 0 95 0 51 and 0 35 0 45 0 38 respectively table 5 on the whole the mmpmlm showed an elevated performance over the 4 precipitation products according to the evaluation metrics the overall accuracy had been greatly improved especially r had increased from 0 52 to 0 84 and rmse had been compressed from 5 5 mm day to 1 99 mm day which proved there was no serious overestimation or underestimation from the aspect of classification evaluation the average csi pod and far of mmpmlm during 1981 2017 were 0 84 0 89 and 0 24 3 2 comparison of spatial distribution between msmp and multi source precipitation products the spatial distribution of the multi annual average daily precipitation of each precipitation product in the yrb were shown in fig 5 respectively however it was worth mentioning that there were few measured gauges in the basin and its surrounding areas especially located in the upper reaches of high altitude areas so the spatial distribution obtained by kriging interpolation for the measured gauges was impossible to accurately describe the measured multi annual average daily precipitation distribution in yrb therefore we do not use the spatial distribution of the measured gauges based on interpolation method as the reference while directly calculate the multi annual daily average of each gauge and spatially displayed as points in the basin fig 4 it can be seen from fig 4 the highest precipitation was 3 21 mm which occurred in lower reaches of the basin and the minimum was 1 19 mm which occurred in the upper reaches the overall spatial distribution was uneven gradually decreasing from the southeast to the northwest inland which was similar to the spatial distribution of the multi annual average precipitation in mainland china locally higher value of precipitation occurred in parts of the middle reaches of the yalong river which was closely related to the fragmentation of the qinghai tibet plateau in the study area and the crisscrossing of mountains around the basin such as the bayan har and hengduan mountains the spatial distribution of multi annual daily average precipitation during the corresponding research period of other four precipitation products were shown in fig 5 the spatial distribution of the four products were similar to that of the measured gauges on the whole all decreasing from the southeast to the northwest inland but the local differences were large among them aph was obviously larger in the east of the middle and lower reaches of the basin and the precipitation center was biased to the middle and lower reaches and decreased along the upstream to the northwest the spatial distribution characteristics were obvious and continuous with a slight flattening phenomenon from the specific numerical point of view the maximum value of aph was 2 68 mm and the minimum was 1 11 mm both of which were smaller than the actual measured value and the differences were large combining the production process of aph and the manual we speculated it may because the yrb was in a mountainous area and the terrain was complex although data were fully collected the designed mountain precipitation expression in the whole analysis and production was same which lead to the results of the aph represent small in yrb the precipitation of chi had the largest value in the lower reaches of the basin which was 3 63 mm and gradually decreased evenly toward the upstream to 1 01 mm which was closer to the measured precipitation value and the overall spatial distribution was continuous without obvious flattening phenomenon according to the product manual chi was equipped with rain measuring radar and microwave imager to detect precipitation avoiding underestimating the intensity of extreme precipitation events in satellite data due to complex terrain so the deviation was small the resolution of era5 was relatively high but it was obviously overestimated the center of the precipitation cluster in the middle reaches was depicted spatially and the overall trend was decreasing from southeast to northwest analyzing the possible reasons for the overall overestimation of era5 may as follows firstly the model data used in era5 may be generally overestimated which had a certain weighting effect on the final precipitation calculation results secondly by inputting a variety of measured data and geographic information data the global precipitation calculated by radiance equation and physical process mainly tended to the high precision of europe therefore in the calculation and adjustment of parameters it can not be guaranteed that the precipitation has high precision at any position in the world finally har decreased from southeast to northwest as a whole in space it failed to capture the connected areas of precipitation in the middle reaches and there were obvious regional precipitation calculation errors mainly in a few grids in the northeast of the lower reaches this may be due to the time difference between har and the other three sets of precipitation products however this set of precipitation was more accurate in describing the spatial distribution and numerical value of the upstream the multi annual daily precipitation was spatially rendered to achieve visualization to further illustrate the quality of msmp at spatio temporal scale as shown in fig 6 the precipitation still showed a trend of decreasing inland from the southeast to the northwest after merge but the largest value was slightly higher than the measured gauge data which was 3 39 mm the minimum value in the basin was still at high altitude which was 1 21 mm from the overall performance assessment based on measured gauges mmpmlm was best and robust at predicting precipitation values in yrb and the msmp obtained by mmpmlm captured the accurate distribution of precipitation characteristics in the region reflecting the spatial texture characteristics of precipitation 4 discussion 4 1 the importance of terrain factors and characteristics of seasonal precipitation the complex underlying surface and topography with variable climate in qinghai tibet plateau region made the precipitation in the basin unevenly distributed in time and space therefore it is necessary to discuss the importance of each terrain factor related with precipitation at the measured gauge for the yrb in high mountain areas similarly since the seasonal characteristics of precipitation lead to historical dependence it is also necessary to discuss the spatio temporal distribution of time series according to seasonal characteristics of precipitation after processing all terrain factors at each gauge scatter plots were made with the corresponding multi annual daily precipitation to initially explore the possible relationship between precipitation and terrain factors in the study area it can be seen from fig 7 that the relatively clear relationship between gauges and most terrain factors was linearity among them the linear fitting degree between longitude latitude elevation relative surface fluctuation and precipitation was extremely high not including the sd of these terrain factors and the average determination coefficient were greater than 0 7 while the correlation between slope hillshade aspect and precipitation were weak and the average determination coefficient were about 0 095 this showed that in the yrb and its surrounding areas latitude and longitude elevation and relative surface fluctuation had a controlling effect on precipitation therefore it is necessary to introduce the controlling terrain factor in the multi source merge of precipitation in regions without measured data it can be seen from fig 7 that the relatively clear relationship between gauges and most terrain factors was linearity among them the linear fitting degree between longitude latitude elevation relative surface fluctuation and precipitation was extremely high not including the sd of these terrain factors and the average determination coefficient were greater than 0 7 while the correlation between slope hillshade aspect and precipitation were weak and the average determination coefficient were about 0 095 this showed that in the yrb and its surrounding areas latitude and longitude elevation and relative surface fluctuation had a controlling effect on precipitation therefore it is necessary to introduce the controlling terrain factor in the multi source merge of precipitation in regions without measured data figs 8 and 9 showed the four seasonal multi annual average daily spatial distribution of each precipitation product and msmp respectively it can be seen that the multi annual average daily spatial distribution of the four precipitation products in spring summer and autumn had little difference on the whole but some differences exist in certain local aeras the specific manifestations were as follows the maximum precipitation value in spring occurred in the southeast of the middle reaches of the basin the maximum precipitation value in summer and autumn was in the lower reaches of the basin and decreased from southeast to northwest inland while the four precipitation products had different performance in winter specifically the minimum precipitation of aph occurred in the middle reaches of the basin and increased upstream and downstream minimum precipitation of era5 was in the upper reaches of the basin and increased from northwest to southeast the precipitation of chi in the middle and upper reaches of the basin tended to the maximum and the minimum precipitation appeared in the middle reaches of the basin the maximum precipitation of har occurred in the upper reaches of the basin and decreased from northwest to southeast as can be seen from the above results due to the seasonal characteristics of precipitation precipitation products from different sources performed different in certain areas and the difference was more obvious in winter with scarce precipitation and in the daily precipitation analysis section 3 2 the spatial distribution of the four precipitation products is relatively consistent and distortion phenomenon is not reflected due to the large slide window from the perspective of the spatial variation characteristics of msmp in four seasons the local areas with obvious differences after merging were all high altitude or dangerous mountainous areas with scarce measured gauges therefore combined with the above analysis and discussion it can be seen combining the seasonal precipitation characteristics of the basin is important for the improvement of precipitation in region with few and no data 4 2 validation of hydrological effects of msmp precipitation is an important part of the hydrological circulation and a key input data for runoff simulation in theory the improvement of precipitation accuracy can also be mapped to the precipitation runoff simulation process which is driven by the hydrological model in the watershed therefore after verifying that the mmpmlm has good effect and robustness we evaluated the accuracy of hydrological effects of msmp and hoped to provide methods and references for better hydrological forecasting in high mountain areas lacking data firstly the large scale hydrological model vic with a grid resolution of 0 25 0 25 was constructed in the yrb the hydrological model based on the msmp with 0 25 0 25 was used to calibrate and validate the daily runoff at ertan hydrological station from 1981 to 2017 the calibration period was from 1981 to 2001 and the validation period was from 2002 to 2017 both periods included relatively complete of high normal and low hydrology years the daily runoff variation trend of the yrb was finally simulated as shown in fig 10 and table 6 from the evaluated value in table 6 the overall goodness of fit was good the similar degree was high and the deviation degree was small the measured multi annual average daily runoff was 1596 51 m3 s and the multi annual average daily runoff simulated by the msmp was 1606 28 m3 s which was close to the corresponding measured value the nash and r in the calibration period and validation period were 0 89 0 84 and 0 95 0 92 respectively while nash and r decreased compared with the calibration period in the validation period from the perspective of rmse the discrete degree of simulated runoff and measured runoff was small which was closer to the true value fig 10 showed the fitting accuracy of daily simulated runoff and measured runoff to highlight the visualization effect of simulated runoff during low water season the daily runoff was logarithmically processed and then compared with each other from fig 10 the overall trend of simulated runoff obtained by msmp was well fitted with the measured runoff which can highlight the main characteristic status of the measured runoff hydrograph the runoff obtained from msmp fitted well with the measured runoff peak but it was slightly overestimated in 1996 1998 and 2015 and underestimated in the dry season from 1981 to 1999 therefore combined with the daily runoff assessment results and the runoff fitting figure it can be obtained the msmp had good applicability in the yrb and can be used be used for hydrological forecasting 4 3 the advantages and disadvantages of multi source merge precipitation for now most mainstream multi source merge precipitation only focuses on short term precipitation forecast and the complexity and diversity of merge methods while the factors affecting precipitation and the significance of multi source merge precipitation products have not been explored therefore our merge method is different from previous related studies our proposed method not only advisably considered multiple long series sources to obtain long series high precision precipitation forecasts but also considered the factors affecting precipitation to ensure the robustness and accuracy of model under the condition of introducing multi source precipitation for example era5 can finely describe the precipitation center in the basin but at the same time seriously overestimate the precipitation value of mainland china the mmpmlm did not propagate the nearly twice overestimated precipitation to the final msmp product while retaining the advantages of each precipitation product in addition the mmpmlm introduced explainable physical factors that were closely related to precipitation which made a significant contribution to the accuracy correction in areas with few or no data finally the msmp with long sequence can be evaluated for the accuracy from the perspective of hydrological simulation to verify the effectiveness in areas with few and no data it is undeniable that our proposed framework still had the following shortcomings the ml method had a slight overfitting phenomenon due to the adjustment of parameters but from the three aspects of numerical evaluation classification evaluation and hydrological effect evaluation its accuracy was significantly improved 5 conclusion the purpose of our study is to integrate multi source precipitation products with environmental factors and seasonal precipitation characteristics of the basin based on ml model to obtain high precision precipitation product and also provided reference for solving hydrological simulation research in areas with little or even no data the key findings include but are not limited to 1 ml model based on terrain factors and seasonal precipitation characteristics can optimally integrate multi precision and multi source precipitation products of different resolutions and different time scales providing a merge framework model that can theoretically practically combine more explicable factors which affecting precipitation and multi source precipitation products 2 the mmpmlm improved the precipitation estimates of the four products in terms of time and space indicating that mmpmlm has strong robustness and applicability the merged precipitation product msmp has a high matching degree and strong consistency with the precipitation data of the ground measured gauges 3 the validation based on vic hydrological model showed msmp obtained by mmpmlm can meet the long term hydrological forecasting of the basin which indicating the corresponding products or merged precipitation product can be directly used for hydrological situation exploration in

3356,accurate estimation of precipitation over the qinghai tibet plateau tp remains a challenge at high spatio temporal scales this research proposed a machine learning ml framework based on multi source products which was involved with seasonal precipitation characteristics and terrain factors to improve the spatio temporal accuracy of precipitation and hydrology simulations in the yalong river basin on the southeastern edge of the tp the main conclusions and results include but were not limited to 1 the ml model based on terrain factors and seasonal precipitation characteristics can wisely integrate multi precision and multi source precipitation products of different resolutions and different time scales indicating that the merge model is robust and has a good generalization ability 2 based on measured gauges the proposed merge model improved the accuracy of precipitation products the pearson s correlation coefficient r increased from 0 52 to 0 84 and root mean square error rmse had been compressed from 5 5 mm day to 1 99 mm day and the spatial distribution of precipitation in regions with few measured gauges was corrected 3 the accuracy of long series product obtained by merge model can be used to evaluate from the perspective of hydrological simulation the method proposed in this study may be helpful to greatly improve the temporal and spatial accuracy of precipitation in high latitude areas with complex terrain and was committed to the study of hydrological cycle keywords precipitation machine learning multi source products a merge model improving precision 1 introduction precipitation is an important dynamic input for the model to study the hydrological cycle system in a basin or region and it is one of the most important basic data for studying water resources niu et al 2017 dong et al 2020 however the spatio temporal variation of precipitation is quite different and limited by some geographical environments so it is difficult to comprehensively promote the global precipitation measurement especially in the qinghai tibet plateau with high spatio temporal scale gat and airey 2006 gebregiorgis and hossain 2012 ma et al 2018 zhu et al 2021 at present the sources of precipitation data and merged precipitation products are mainly ground rain gauge data radar monitoring data and satellite retrieval data lyu et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 the ground rain gauge has high accuracy in monitoring precipitation but it is less distributed in plateau mountain desert and other areas and even does not exist in uninhabited areas at the same time the rain gauge data is precipitation of point and the precipitation distribution obtained by interpolating the rain gauge data has a large error which can not better reflect the spatial variation characteristics of precipitation compared with others kidd et al 2017 shen et al 2018 radar monitoring precipitation has certain accuracy and can obtain precipitation information in a large range however due to the complexity of its own technology such as terrain occlusion and the influence of reflection change factors the error of radar monitoring precipitation is caused and in a large range with the accuracy of radar monitoring can not meet the business requirements compared with the former two satellite precipitation products have the advantages of higher temporal and spatial resolution however their accuracy is still affected by the accuracy of remote sensing retrieval algorithms and numerical prediction models therefore the data is also difficult to apply to the hydrological simulation of the certain basin directly shen et al 2010 maggioni et al 2017 tang et al 2020 now using the hereinbefore precipitation products for multi source merge is currently the mainstream way to improve precipitation accuracy including spatial interpolation deviation correction machine learning ml and weighted average tang et al 2018 zhu et al 2021 among them spatial interpolation can improve the spatial continuity of the measured gauge data but it is more sensitive to the density of the gauge network and cannot interpolate multiple sets of precipitation products at the same time deviation correction can effectively improve the inherent error of the precipitation product when the reference data is complete but it is easy to cause the error of the reference data to propagate to the final correction data due to the excessive correction of the parameters and it is worth noting this method is less robust when calibrating multiple sets of precipitation products the weighted average method mainly uses precipitation related variables to allocate the weight of the multi source precipitation product but the weight allocation is easily affected by factitious empirical strategies in addition it is worth mentioning that most of the hereinbefore methods are based on mathematical equations and there are many untenable assumptions however the current mainstream method of machine learning is powerful and can extract high dimensional non linear relationships into implicit expressions between precipitation products of different sources and different precisions so as to obtain high precision merge precipitation lecun et al 2015 shen et al 2017 for example tao et al 2016 proposed a deep neural network framework to reduce the deviation and false alarm of satellite cloud images after calibrating persiann cc in the central united states it was found the average deviation was reduced by 88 and the false alarm of 38 percent of grids was reduced to improve the accuracy of short term precipitation forecasts qiu et al 2017 used a multi task convolutional neural network to extract the correlation between time series and stations to predict precipitation the results showed that compared with the product of european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf the correlation coefficient between final precipitation product and observed precipitation increased from 0 3 to 0 6 wu et al 2020 used convolutional neural network and long short term memory network to explore the spatio temporal relationship among satellite precipitation measured sites and thermal infrared images while merging them at the same time finally a merged dataset of daily precipitation in china from 2001 to 2005 was obtained which had a higher resolution of 0 05 and a higher accuracy nourani et al 2020 proposed a framework based on a two stage model of artificial intelligence ensemble and spatial interpolation which used different scenario combinations to build the temporal model of 7precipitation gauges located at northern cyprus so as to improve the precision of the model and obtain the precipitation of the whole region through spatial modeling the overall results show that the combination of temporal and spatial modeling tools could simulate the precipitation appropriately by serving unique features of both tools zhang et al 2021 introduced multiple cloud attributes soil moisture and etc to improve the early run of the integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm imerg from 2015 to 2018 based on four types of ml methods the comprehensive root mean square error was reduced by 60 based on the hereinbefore research we firstly found the current research is mainly devoted to the improvement of the method which makes the merge model more complicated however the accuracy of the basic data remained the same even if the more high dimensional and more complex method is adopted the increase in accuracy of the result is minimal in addition most research was still focused on areas with dense rainfall gauges or plains with single climatic conditions finally we found the time series of multi source precipitation products used in most of the studies devoted to improving the accuracy were short and their accuracy and practicability were not evaluated from the perspective of hydrological application tao et al 2016 qiu et al 2017 wu et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 zhu et al 2021 inspired by the hereinbefore research our main purposes were as follows 1 on the basis of exploring the relationship between interpretable environmental factors and precipitation in the basin we used the principal component analysis pca method to screen and extract the principal components of terrain factors and explored seasonal characteristic variables in combination with the law of precipitation in the study area 2 introducing the hereinbefore seasonal characteristics and terrain factors a multi source and multi temporal spatial scale precipitation merge model was constructed based on machine learning 3 exploring the applicability of multi source merged precipitation msmp in areas with insufficient data such as the qinghai tibet plateau from the two aspects of precipitation accuracy evaluation and the practicability of hydrological cycle effect 2 study area and data method 2 1 introduction of the study area the yalong river is a tributary of the upper reaches of the yangtze river which is a typical mountain river it is located on the eastern edge of the qinghai tibet plateau surrounded by mountains above 4000 m above sea level on the east west and north sides fig 1 the elevation of the yalong river on the south side is relatively low about 2000 m zhao et al 2021a b the yalong river basin yrb belongs to the western sichuan plateau climate zone the multi annual average precipitation in the entire basin is 800 1100 mm but the spatio temporal distribution during the intra annual is extremely uneven in terms of space affected by topographic conditions the distribution of precipitation in the basin shows a decreasing trend from southeast to northwest inland in terms of time due to the influence of the summer monsoon the heavy precipitation is mainly concentrated from june to september of which the frequency is the highest from july to august it is precisely the above mentioned topographical and climatic characteristics that have led to the scarcity and dispersion of measured precipitation gauges in the yrb which also makes the accuracy of some precipitation products in the region not high zhao et al 2021a b 2 2 data to ensure the exploration of hydrological effects in region with few or no data the length and integrity of time series about precipitation were also taken into account while considering the diversity of precipitation sources comparing with existing research results zambrano et al 2017 wei et al 2018 yuan et al 2018 wang et

source merge precipitation machine learning model based on seasonal characteristics and terrain factors hereinafter referred to as mmpmlm proposed by this study was shown in fig 2 the ml models involved in mmpmlm were described in detail in section 2 3 1 and the modeling steps of mmpmlm were elaborated in section 2 3 2 2 3 1 machine learning extreme gradient boosting naive bayesian and multi layer perceptron were selected as the basic algorithms of this research framework from the perspective of the complexity and application of ml the advantages and principles of each ml were as follows 1 extreme gradient boosting xgb xgb or extreme gradient boosting was proposed by chen tianqi of the university of washington in 2016 and published at the 22nd acm sigkdd international conference on knowledge discovery and data mining xgb is mainly built based on the gradient boosting decision tree gbdt algorithm and uses ensemble learning to optimize a single weak predictor to improve the accuracy of prediction and achieve fast calculations chen et al 2016 the main idea is to continuously perform feature splitting on the existing trees and each new tree generated is based on the residual and predicted value of the previous tree as input in this way by adding the tree back and forth and giving higher weights to the incorrectly labeled samples in the previous training finally a better regression or classification performance is obtained and the purpose of reducing the loss function is achieved assuming that there are k trees in the xgb ensemble model the prediction result of the model on the i t h sample is 1 m i k i k k f k n i among them k represents the k t h tree k represents the total number of trees in the ensemble model m i k represents the sum of weights of all leaf nodes of k trees that is the prediction results finally returned by xgboost model n i is the i t h predicted sample f k n i is the weight returned by the node after the i t h sample is input into the k t h tree that is the result the training objective function includes its own loss function and the regularization term added to prevent over fitting 2 o b j θ i 1 k l m i m i k 1 k ω f k 3 ω f k γ t 1 2 λ w 2 among them l m i m i is the training error between the true value and the predicted value of the sample n i that is the corresponding loss function ω f k is the regularization penalty term of the k t h tree to prevent overfitting t represents the number of leaf nodes of the tree w represents the predicted value on each node 2 naive bayesian nb the full name of nb is naive bayesian which was first proposed by duda and hart 1973 it is based on the bayes theorem in statistics and the algorithm is simple and has a stable classification effect in the bayes theorem let h be a kind of hypothesis the data sample series is x c the label of x is unknown and c is a specific class it can be obtained p h x is the probability that the h hypothesis is established under the condition of a given sample x that is the posterior probability of h under condition x conversely p x h can also be obtained as the posterior probability of x under the condition h the p h p x and p x h involved in the above theory can be calculated according to the given data 4 p h x p h p x h p x the hereinbefore is an introduction to bayesian theory and nb is based on the theory and it contains an assumption that each attribute is independent and unrelated to each other the specific nb theory is as follows i first for each data sample extract its corresponding n dimensional feature vector and use x x 1 x 2 x n to describe n metrics for n samples of attributes a 1 a 2 a n ii secondly given an unknown sample data set x predict which category x belongs to among c 1 c 2 c m based on the highest posterior probability if and only if p c i x p c j x 1 j m j i that is to maximize the posterior probability p c i x p x c i p c i p x the classifier will label the sample as c i based on the calculation result iii in the above second step of calculation if the data set has more attributes the amount of calculation for p x c i is larger at this time assume that the class conditions are independent of each other given the sample class label assume that the attribute values are independent of each other and have different sources that is p x c i k i n p x k c i where p x k c i can be estimated from training samples iv for the classification of the unknown sample x calculate p x c i p c i for the class c i if and only if p x c i p c i p x c j p c j 1 j m j i x c i that is x is classified as the largest class c i in p x c i p c i the objective function of the nb is as follows 5 o b j x m a x p c i 1 n p x i c 3 multi layer perceptron mlp mlp is a multilayer perceptron fully known as multi layer perceptron its principle is clear simple and easy to use it is the most widely used artificial neural network structure at present mlp includes an input an output and hidden layers in between each layer has a certain number of neurons the input layer is mainly used to receive external information to activate the neural network structure and does not participate in calculations the hidden layers receive information from the input layer and extract features and finally the output layer outputs the final result according to the different weights of the hidden layer neural unit and its own bias hampshire and pearlmutter 1991 take the simplest mlp with one hidden layer as an example the input data of the input layer is 6 x x 1 x 2 x i x n t input of the i t h neuron in the first layer of the hidden layer 7 net 1 i in ω 1 1 x 1 bias 1 1 ω 1 2 x 2 bias 1 2 ω 1 n x i n bias 1 n i n ω 1 i x i b i a s 1 i output of the i t h neuron in the first layer of the hidden layer 8 a i net

second connection layer to the output layer bias 2 i is the bias of the second connection layer to the output layer 2 3 2 multi source merge machine learning model based on seasonal characteristics and terrain factors mmpmlm introduced terrain factors and seasonal characteristics of precipitation on the basis of adopting ml model as the feature to construct the final model the main processing and operation of the mmpmlm model included in the following steps 1 screening and extraction of multi source precipitation data 2 pre processing of multi source precipitation products and measured gauge data 3 extraction and pretreatment of terrain factor 4 extraction and pretreatment of seasonal characteristic attributes of precipitation 5 processing of features at no label grid samples 6 stacking modeling with the model as a feature the specific operation details of each step were as follows 1 screening and extraction of multi source precipitation data to improve the accuracy of precipitation in no measured data areas and considering the temporal and spatial consistency of precipitation we selected four types of precipitation products with different sources and resolutions see sec 2 2 for details of precipitation products according to the geographical location of 19 gauges in yrb the data of each precipitation product at the location of each gauge were extracted and processed into daily time series the precipitation products of aph era5 and chi were processed and sorted into daily raster data and har was transformed into daily raster data after corresponding projection conversion 2 pre processing of multi source precipitation products and measured gauge data firstly the daily precipitation data of 19 gauges and the extracted daily data of each product were standardized to make them in the range of 0 to 1 which can avoid model instability caused by the excessive fluctuation of the data set in addition dimensionless data was helpful for the rapid convergence of the model it should be noted that due to the large number of zero value in the daily precipitation data it had an impact on the tail of the data distribution of the training set and the validation set therefore to ensure the feature consistency between the training and validation set the characteristic values of the corresponding training set were used when the test set was normalized 11 x norm x x min x max x min where x was the precipitation value of certain series x min and x max was the minimum and maximum values in the series respectively 3 extraction and pretreatment of terrain factor in this study combined methods of yin et al 2008 and the conditions of actual topographic in the yrb 22 terrain factors were selected as shown in table 1 and pca was used to eliminate redundant information firstly the geographical statistical analysis of 19 meteorological gauges in the yrb showed that 25 km was a more suitable distance for extracting terrain factor samples therefore a buffer zone with a radius of 12 5 km was constructed for each measured gauge and each terrain factor within the sample range were extracted based on 90 m high precision dem data the terrain factors were not independent of each other and the data was redundant therefore pca was used to reduce the dimensionality of multiple attributes and effective terrain factor information can be extracted on the basis of retaining most attribute features as input for subsequent msmp correction it can be seen from table 2 that the four principal components had explained 88 53 of the variance percentage that is the four principal components can basically reflect the main characteristics of multiple terrain factors in the yrb the terrain factors that had a greater impact on the first principal component were elevation mean elevation and median elevation which clearly reflected the influence of altitude in the yrb the terrain factors that had a greater impact on the second principal component were area occupied by east southern western and northern aspect which reflected the influence of aspect similarly the terrain factors that had a great impact on the third and fourth principal components were mean hillshade standard deviation of relative surface fluctuation and longitude latitude which reflected the influence of terrain and geographical location respectively finally the coefficients of the four principal component factors corresponding to each gauge were calculated based on the eigenvalues and the corresponding principal component values were obtained 4 extraction and pretreatment of seasonal characteristic attributes of precipitation precipitation data are time series dependent especially in regions with distinct climatic characteristics the average daily precipitation was defined as the ratio of the cumulative precipitation to the number of days during the study period to obtain the seasonal characteristic attributes of precipitation the average daily precipitation of 19 measured gauges in four seasons was calculated and then the precipitation in four seasons was standardized according to step 2 after processing the precipitation data of each gauge 148 standardized data can be obtained corresponding to one gauge that was each one gauge corresponded to four seasonal characteristic values for each year and the time range was from 1981 to 2017 when used as the feature of ml in the follow up the application was as follows for example for the measured gauge x x stood for any one gauge the daily data from march 1 to may 31 1981 corresponded to only one seasonal characteristic feature that was the spring characteristic value similarly the daily data of gauge x from june 1 1981 to august 31 1981 corresponded to only one seasonal characteristic feature that was the summer characteristic value 5 processing of features at no label grid samples to merge the daily scale multi source grid precipitation data the resolutions of the four precipitation products were aligned into 0 25 the yrb was divided into 250 grids of 0 25 0 25 in total and the same pretreatment of dimensionless standardization was performed for the precipitation product data in each grid according to step 2 in each grid the terrain factors were extracted according to the method of step 3 and the same postprocessing was performed on these factors finally based on the measured gauges to divide yrb into sub regions by thiessen polygon fig 3 and the daily surface precipitation data in each sub region was obtained then according to the time division of the four seasons the daily average value of the areal precipitation in each season in sub region was calculated and the obtained time series of the areal precipitation in the four seasons were also standardized then the seasonal characteristic attributes in each sub region calculated based on the thiessen polygon were assigned to the 0 25 grids which were contained in the sub region it should be noted here that if a 0 25 grid located in multiple sub regions calculate the proportion of the grid in each sub region and select the seasonal feature attribute in the sub region with the largest proportion 6 stacking modeling with the model as a feature to avoid generalization errors in single machine learning the multi ensemble model used a single machine learning model as an input feature was used to improve the accuracy of msmp by learning the learned features to quickly reach the optimum when a new task arrived that is stacking the stacking method introduced here is slightly different it is to integrate a mass of models namely base classifier while the integration of other ml was composed of multiple internal decision trees in brief stacking is to train multiple different models first and then train the next model with the output of each previously trained model as input to obtain the only one final output result here stacking was divided into two layers in our research the first layer included xgb and nb model and the second layer only included mlp model the specific methods were as follows due to different period of each precipitation product the merge process was divided into three periods namely 1981 1999 2000 2014 and 2015 2017 here we used period from 1981to 1999 as an example to elaborate after pre processing the multi source precipitation data terrain factors and seasonal characteristics to obtain features of each sample the data set was divided into two sets training set and test set the training set were the daily samples of 19 observed gauges from 1981 to 1999 and the test set was the daily samples of 238 grids from 1981 to 1999 after removing 12 observed gauges included in the basin fig 3 the features of each sample in the two data sets included three types of precipitation products terrain factors and seasonal characteristics that is to say the input of xgb or nb included three precipitation products aph era5 and chi four principal components of terrain factors and seasonal characteristic attributes of precipitation after processing the training set was divided into 4 parts according to the spatial distribution of the measured gauges as shown in fig 3 namely t r a i n 1 t r a i n 2 t r a i n 3 and t r a i n 4 and each of them contained daily sample data of 5 4 5 5 gauges from 1981 to 1999 respectively for each base classifier in the first layer use t r a i n 1 t r a i n 2 t r a i n 3 and t r a i n 4 to do the four fold cross check in turn and make predictions on the test set at the same time as each cross check in this way the base classifier will finally output 4 parts of predicted values on the entire training set namely p r e t r a i n 1 p r e t r a i n 2 p r e t r a i n 3 and p r e t r a i n 4 it can be found that the longitudinal superposition of the four parts of predicted values was the predicted value of the whole training set which was recorded as a 1 for the 4 parts of predicted values output from the test set we took the average postscript as b 1 similarly perform the hereinbefore operation steps for another base classifier in the first layer to obtain a 2 and b 2 finally the predicted values a 1 and a 2 obtained by the two base classifiers of the first layer based on the training set were used as features of the model in the next layer after training the model in the second layer prediction was made based on b 1 and b 2 after merging the precipitation from 1981 to 1999 continue to do the same treatment for the periods from 2000 to 2014 and 2015 to 2017 finally the median filter method was used to ensure the smoothness of the msmp at the junction of the three time periods it was worth mentioning here that the number of precipitation products in the sample features was different in three different periods 2 4 evaluation indices in this study referring to the previous literatures zhang et al 2021 zhu et al 2021 ml based algorithms were evaluated from the two aspects of numerical accuracy and classification evaluation root mean square error rmse was used to reflect the quantitative consistency which represented the deviation between precipitation products and measured precipitation and it was also sensitive to large or small errors in measurement which can well reflect the precision of measurement the value range of rmse was 0 when it was 0 it meant there was no difference at all in addition pearson correlation coefficient r was also introduced on the basis of rmse see eq 12 to synchronously evaluate the simulation accuracy of precipitation from the aspect of numerical accuracy the calculation formulas were as follows 12 r m s e 1 n i 1 n w i c i 2 13 r i 1 n w i w c i c i 1 n w i w 2 i 1 n c i c 2 where w i represented daily precipitation data of various products c i represented the measured daily precipitation data i 1 2 n n w a s t h e t o t a l n u m b e r o f d a y s o f t h e s a m p l e w a n d c represented the average value of various precipitation products and measured precipitation respectively in terms of classification evaluation the critical success index csi probability of detection pod and false alarm ratio far were used to evaluate the daily monitoring ability of precipitation products csi represented the probability of successfully predicting a precipitation event and the value range was 0 1 and closer it was to 1 the higher the success probability was pod indicated the retrieval hit rate for each precipitation event with a value range of 0 1 which the value of 1 indicated the hit rate was 100 and 0 indicated the retrieval was completely wrong far represent the probability that the precipitation product make an error in the prediction of real precipitation events the value range was 0 1 and the larger the value the higher the probability of error the calculation formulas were as follows 14 c s i n 11 n 11 n 10 n 01 15 p o d n 11 n 11 n 01 16 f a r n 10 n 11 n 10 among them n 11 n 01 n 10 was defined in table 3 in which the threshold for judging whether there was rain can be set by user itself generally 0 1 mm in addition to verify whether the runoff obtained by the msmp can be used as future forecast results nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nash in hydrology nilawar and waikar 2018 nourani et al 2021 was additionally introduced on the basis of r see eq 13 and rmse see eq 12 to evaluate the runoff simulation accuracy 17 nash 1 i 1 n q sim i q obs i 2 i 1 n q obs i q obs 2 where q sim i is the simulated runoff q obs i is measured runoff q obs is the average value of the measured runoff 3 result 3 1 statistical precision of msmp and multi source precipitation products based on measured gauges calculating the statistical performance indices of msmp and four multi source precipitation products to verify the robustness and generalization of mmpmlm firstly the accuracy of aph from 1981 to 2014 era5 and chi from 1981 to 2017 and har data from 2000 to 2017 were evaluated based on the measured gauge data by analyzing the daily series of four precipitation products the r rmse between aph chi era5 har and the measured daily precipitation were obtained as shown in table 4 the r of the overall four types of precipitation were between 0 36 and 0 78 in which the correlation between aph and measured data was the highest and the correlation between har and measured data was the lowest judging by the rmse it can be seen there was no large or small error between the four precipitation products and the measured data and the dispersion between the whole and the measured precipitation was small in terms of classification evaluation aph and har were the best with csi pod and far of 0 63 095 0 34 and 0 52 0 88 0 44 respectively era5 was the second and chi performed the worst with csi pod and far of 0 48 0 95 0 51 and 0 35 0 45 0 38 respectively table 5 on the whole the mmpmlm showed an elevated performance over the 4 precipitation products according to the evaluation metrics the overall accuracy had been greatly improved especially r had increased from 0 52 to 0 84 and rmse had been compressed from 5 5 mm day to 1 99 mm day which proved there was no serious overestimation or underestimation from the aspect of classification evaluation the average csi pod and far of mmpmlm during 1981 2017 were 0 84 0 89 and 0 24 3 2 comparison of spatial distribution between msmp and multi source precipitation products the spatial distribution of the multi annual average daily precipitation of each precipitation product in the yrb were shown in fig 5 respectively however it was worth mentioning that there were few measured gauges in the basin and its surrounding areas especially located in the upper reaches of high altitude areas so the spatial distribution obtained by kriging interpolation for the measured gauges was impossible to accurately describe the measured multi annual average daily precipitation distribution in yrb therefore we do not use the spatial distribution of the measured gauges based on interpolation method as the reference while directly calculate the multi annual daily average of each gauge and spatially displayed as points in the basin fig 4 it can be seen from fig 4 the highest precipitation was 3 21 mm which occurred in lower reaches of the basin and the minimum was 1 19 mm which occurred in the upper reaches the overall spatial distribution was uneven gradually decreasing from the southeast to the northwest inland which was similar to the spatial distribution of the multi annual average precipitation in mainland china locally higher value of precipitation occurred in parts of the middle reaches of the yalong river which was closely related to the fragmentation of the qinghai tibet plateau in the study area and the crisscrossing of mountains around the basin such as the bayan har and hengduan mountains the spatial distribution of multi annual daily average precipitation during the corresponding research period of other four precipitation products were shown in fig 5 the spatial distribution of the four products were similar to that of the measured gauges on the whole all decreasing from the southeast to the northwest inland but the local differences were large among them aph was obviously larger in the east of the middle and lower reaches of the basin and the precipitation center was biased to the middle and lower reaches and decreased along the upstream to the northwest the spatial distribution characteristics were obvious and continuous with a slight flattening phenomenon from the specific numerical point of view the maximum value of aph was 2 68 mm and the minimum was 1 11 mm both of which were smaller than the actual measured value and the differences were large combining the production process of aph and the manual we speculated it may because the yrb was in a mountainous area and the terrain was complex although data were fully collected the designed mountain precipitation expression in the whole analysis and production was same which lead to the results of the aph represent small in yrb the precipitation of chi had the largest value in the lower reaches of the basin which was 3 63 mm and gradually decreased evenly toward the upstream to 1 01 mm which was closer to the measured precipitation value and the overall spatial distribution was continuous without obvious flattening phenomenon according to the product manual chi was equipped with rain measuring radar and microwave imager to detect precipitation avoiding underestimating the intensity of extreme precipitation events in satellite data due to complex terrain so the deviation was small the resolution of era5 was relatively high but it was obviously overestimated the center of the precipitation cluster in the middle reaches was depicted spatially and the overall trend was decreasing from southeast to northwest analyzing the possible reasons for the overall overestimation of era5 may as follows firstly the model data used in era5 may be generally overestimated which had a certain weighting effect on the final precipitation calculation results secondly by inputting a variety of measured data and geographic information data the global precipitation calculated by radiance equation and physical process mainly tended to the high precision of europe therefore in the calculation and adjustment of parameters it can not be guaranteed that the precipitation has high precision at any position in the world finally har decreased from southeast to northwest as a whole in space it failed to capture the connected areas of precipitation in the middle reaches and there were obvious regional precipitation calculation errors mainly in a few grids in the northeast of the lower reaches this may be due to the time difference between har and the other three sets of precipitation products however this set of precipitation was more accurate in describing the spatial distribution and numerical value of the upstream the multi annual daily precipitation was spatially rendered to achieve visualization to further illustrate the quality of msmp at spatio temporal scale as shown in fig 6 the precipitation still showed a trend of decreasing inland from the southeast to the northwest after merge but the largest value was slightly higher than the measured gauge data which was 3 39 mm the minimum value in the basin was still at high altitude which was 1 21 mm from the overall performance assessment based on measured gauges mmpmlm was best and robust at predicting precipitation values in yrb and the msmp obtained by mmpmlm captured the accurate distribution of precipitation characteristics in the region reflecting the spatial texture characteristics of precipitation 4 discussion 4 1 the importance of terrain factors and characteristics of seasonal precipitation the complex underlying surface and topography with variable climate in qinghai tibet plateau region made the precipitation in the basin unevenly distributed in time and space therefore it is necessary to discuss the importance of each terrain factor related with precipitation at the measured gauge for the yrb in high mountain areas similarly since the seasonal characteristics of precipitation lead to historical dependence it is also necessary to discuss the spatio temporal distribution of time series according to seasonal characteristics of precipitation after processing all terrain factors at each gauge scatter plots were made with the corresponding multi annual daily precipitation to initially explore the possible relationship between precipitation and terrain factors in the study area it can be seen from fig 7 that the relatively clear relationship between gauges and most terrain factors was linearity among them the linear fitting degree between longitude latitude elevation relative surface fluctuation and precipitation was extremely high not including the sd of these terrain factors and the average determination coefficient were greater than 0 7 while the correlation between slope hillshade aspect and precipitation were weak and the average determination coefficient were about 0 095 this showed that in the yrb and its surrounding areas latitude and longitude elevation and relative surface fluctuation had a controlling effect on precipitation therefore it is necessary to introduce the controlling terrain factor in the multi source merge of precipitation in regions without measured data it can be seen from fig 7 that the relatively clear relationship between gauges and most terrain factors was linearity among them the linear fitting degree between longitude latitude elevation relative surface fluctuation and precipitation was extremely high not including the sd of these terrain factors and the average determination coefficient were greater than 0 7 while the correlation between slope hillshade aspect and precipitation were weak and the average determination coefficient were about 0 095 this showed that in the yrb and its surrounding areas latitude and longitude elevation and relative surface fluctuation had a controlling effect on precipitation therefore it is necessary to introduce the controlling terrain factor in the multi source merge of precipitation in regions without measured data figs 8 and 9 showed the four seasonal multi annual average daily spatial distribution of each precipitation product and msmp respectively it can be seen that the multi annual average daily spatial distribution of the four precipitation products in spring summer and autumn had little difference on the whole but some differences exist in certain local aeras the specific manifestations were as follows the maximum precipitation value in spring occurred in the southeast of the middle reaches of the basin the maximum precipitation value in summer and autumn was in the lower reaches of the basin and decreased from southeast to northwest inland while the four precipitation products had different performance in winter specifically the minimum precipitation of aph occurred in the middle reaches of the basin and increased upstream and downstream minimum precipitation of era5 was in the upper reaches of the basin and increased from northwest to southeast the precipitation of chi in the middle and upper reaches of the basin tended to the maximum and the minimum precipitation appeared in the middle reaches of the basin the maximum precipitation of har occurred in the upper reaches of the basin and decreased from northwest to southeast as can be seen from the above results due to the seasonal characteristics of precipitation precipitation products from different sources performed different in certain areas and the difference was more obvious in winter with scarce precipitation and in the daily precipitation analysis section 3 2 the spatial distribution of the four precipitation products is relatively consistent and distortion phenomenon is not reflected due to the large slide window from the perspective of the spatial variation characteristics of msmp in four seasons the local areas with obvious differences after merging were all high altitude or dangerous mountainous areas with scarce measured gauges therefore combined with the above analysis and discussion it can be seen combining the seasonal precipitation characteristics of the basin is important for the improvement of precipitation in region with few and no data 4 2 validation of hydrological effects of msmp precipitation is an important part of the hydrological circulation and a key input data for runoff simulation in theory the improvement of precipitation accuracy can also be mapped to the precipitation runoff simulation process which is driven by the hydrological model in the watershed therefore after verifying that the mmpmlm has good effect and robustness we evaluated the accuracy of hydrological effects of msmp and hoped to provide methods and references for better hydrological forecasting in high mountain areas lacking data firstly the large scale hydrological model vic with a grid resolution of 0 25 0 25 was constructed in the yrb the hydrological model based on the msmp with 0 25 0 25 was used to calibrate and validate the daily runoff at ertan hydrological station from 1981 to 2017 the calibration period was from 1981 to 2001 and the validation period was from 2002 to 2017 both periods included relatively complete of high normal and low hydrology years the daily runoff variation trend of the yrb was finally simulated as shown in fig 10 and table 6 from the evaluated value in table 6 the overall goodness of fit was good the similar degree was high and the deviation degree was small the measured multi annual average daily runoff was 1596 51 m3 s and the multi annual average daily runoff simulated by the msmp was 1606 28 m3 s which was close to the corresponding measured value the nash and r in the calibration period and validation period were 0 89 0 84 and 0 95 0 92 respectively while nash and r decreased compared with the calibration period in the validation period from the perspective of rmse the discrete degree of simulated runoff and measured runoff was small which was closer to the true value fig 10 showed the fitting accuracy of daily simulated runoff and measured runoff to highlight the visualization effect of simulated runoff during low water season the daily runoff was logarithmically processed and then compared with each other from fig 10 the overall trend of simulated runoff obtained by msmp was well fitted with the measured runoff which can highlight the main characteristic status of the measured runoff hydrograph the runoff obtained from msmp fitted well with the measured runoff peak but it was slightly overestimated in 1996 1998 and 2015 and underestimated in the dry season from 1981 to 1999 therefore combined with the daily runoff assessment results and the runoff fitting figure it can be obtained the msmp had good applicability in the yrb and can be used be used for hydrological forecasting 4 3 the advantages and disadvantages of multi source merge precipitation for now most mainstream multi source merge precipitation only focuses on short term precipitation forecast and the complexity and diversity of merge methods while the factors affecting precipitation and the significance of multi source merge precipitation products have not been explored therefore our merge method is different from previous related studies our proposed method not only advisably considered multiple long series sources to obtain long series high precision precipitation forecasts but also considered the factors affecting precipitation to ensure the robustness and accuracy of model under the condition of introducing multi source precipitation for example era5 can finely describe the precipitation center in the basin but at the same time seriously overestimate the precipitation value of mainland china the mmpmlm did not propagate the nearly twice overestimated precipitation to the final msmp product while retaining the advantages of each precipitation product in addition the mmpmlm introduced explainable physical factors that were closely related to precipitation which made a significant contribution to the accuracy correction in areas with few or no data finally the msmp with long sequence can be evaluated for the accuracy from the perspective of hydrological simulation to verify the effectiveness in areas with few and no data it is undeniable that our proposed framework still had the following shortcomings the ml method had a slight overfitting phenomenon due to the adjustment of parameters but from the three aspects of numerical evaluation classification evaluation and hydrological effect evaluation its accuracy was significantly improved 5 conclusion the purpose of our study is to integrate multi source precipitation products with environmental factors and seasonal precipitation characteristics of the basin based on ml model to obtain high precision precipitation product and also provided reference for solving hydrological simulation research in areas with little or even no data the key findings include but are not limited to 1 ml model based on terrain factors and seasonal precipitation characteristics can optimally integrate multi precision and multi source precipitation products of different resolutions and different time scales providing a merge framework model that can theoretically practically combine more explicable factors which affecting precipitation and multi source precipitation products 2 the mmpmlm improved the precipitation estimates of the four products in terms of time and space indicating that mmpmlm has strong robustness and applicability the merged precipitation product msmp has a high matching degree and strong consistency with the precipitation data of the ground measured gauges 3 the validation based on vic hydrological model showed msmp obtained by mmpmlm can meet the long term hydrological forecasting of the basin which indicating the corresponding products or merged precipitation product can be directly used for hydrological situation exploration in areas with no or little data credit authorship contribution statement yinmao zhao conceptualization methodology writing original draft writing review editing kui xu conceptualization writing original

3357,the transport of water vapor in shale mudrocks plays an important role in many natural and engineering issues such as the global water cycle and shale gas production however the permeability of water vapor in shale is not well understood an experimental approach to investigate the water vapor permeability in shale is presented in this paper water vapor sorption was conducted under the dynamic relative humidity condition in which the vapor evaporation was generated from the liquid distilled water at different gas helium pressures three crushed samples of carboniferous shale from the eastern qaidam basin china were obtained and tested in the experiments the adsorption process of water vapor into the crushed shale was observed and the permeability of water vapor through shale was calculated with the data collected during the dynamic water vapor adsorption process the results show that the permeability decreases with increasing water vapor adsorption the relationship between permeability and water vapor adsorption amount fits an exponential equation well the permeability at the equilibrium of water vapor adsorption is 3 4 orders of magnitude lower than that in the initial stage of water vapor adsorption the decrease in pore size and resulting pore throat blockage cause this permeability reduction the water film thickness and water saturation in the shale pores at adsorption equilibrium were estimated the permeability reduction is closely related to the maximum water film thickness the larger the range of pores blocked by the water film is the more obvious the permeability reduction keywords water vapor adsorption permeability water film thickness permeability reduction 1 introduction water and the global water cycle play an important role in sustaining human survival and ecological balance the global water cycle refers to the hydrological cycle among seawater atmospheric water surface water and groundwater luo et al 2021 which consists of physicochemical processes such as precipitation runoff infiltration plant uptake groundwater flow evaporation condensation sublimation transpiration water vapor transport and anthropogenic actions abbott et al 2019 allan et al 2020 yin and roderick 2020 water vapor transport and dynamic processes can dominate regional mean precipitation changes gimeno et al 2012 in the natural state juvenile water retained in the form of adsorption and condensation is common in shale formations bowker 2007 the transportation evaporation condensation del genio et al 1996 luz and barkan 2010 and adsorption of water in shale have an impact on the global hydrological cycle in recent years natural gas extracted from shale reservoirs has become a significant energy resource which has made researchers worldwide interested in the properties of shale such as its pore structure characteristics labani et al 2013 wang and yu 2017 fluid transport characteristics freeman et al 2011 gao et al 2016 sang et al 2020 methane adsorption capacity billemont et al 2013 ma and yu 2020 and water vapor adsorption characteristics shen et al 2018 cihan et al 2019 yang et al 2021 multistage hydraulic stimulation requiring a large amount of water is a key technology for shale gas development hughes 2013 ghanbari and dehghanpour 2016 using this technology to extract shale gas large amounts of water can be trapped in shale formations with poor physical properties engelder et al 2014 makhanov et al 2014 shales exhibit a dense structure with nanoscale pores loucks et al 2009 retained water usually exists or migrates in the pore space of shale in an adsorbed or free state which may strongly affect the gas storage capacity of the shale ji et al 2012 gasparik et al 2014 wang and yu 2016 wang et al 2018 and the gas transport through the nanoporous channels in the shale landry et al 2016 amann hildenbrand et al 2017 li et al 2019 therefore it is of great significance to understand the distribution and migration characteristics of water in shale nanopores water vapor is usually associated with shale gas in shale reservoirs vengosh et al 2014 li et al 2019 the adsorption capacity of water vapor in shale is stronger than that of methane which will reduce the reserves of methane in the formation vidic et al 2013 li et al 2016a ma and yu 2021 studying the characteristics of water vapor adsorption and distribution in shale pores is of great significance to the development of shale gas li et al 2017 and tokunaga et al 2017 found that as the amount of adsorbed water increases the adsorbed water will gradually condense the amount of water adsorbed on shale is positively correlated with the clay content of the shale ross and marc bustin 2009 gasparik et al 2014 yang et al 2020 studied the water vapor adsorption characteristics of shale under various relative humidities by a gravimetric method determined the pore size distribution and discussed the change in methane adsorption capacity in shale under different relative humidity humidities yuan et al 2014a explored the interaction between water and shale samples on micro and macro scales and analyzed the storage and transportation mechanisms of water sang et al 2018 explained the adsorption behavior of water vapor in clay and shale samples by associating the mineral composition and pore distribution characteristics with the occurrence state of water in pores in addition many scholars have measured and fitted shale water vapor adsorption desorption isotherms tang et al 2017 sang et al 2018 2019 part of the research on water vapor adsorption is based on the moisture balance method of salt solutions with different relative humidities li et al 2016a 2016b and another part is based on the passage of wet dry gas in a closed adsorption tank to measure the mass change of the sample through a microbalance sang et al 2018 however there are few studies on water vapor adsorption with the presence of liquid water evaporation in the adsorption cell permeability is a very significant parameter in shale gas production and characterizes the fluid transport capacity shale permeability has been extensively studied in recent years javadpour 2009 derived the apparent permeability model of gas in nanopores by linearly superimposing knudsen diffusion and slip flow two transport mechanisms shi et al 2013 proposed nonlinear superposition of diffusion and slip flows by using weight coefficients to obtain permeability models under different knudsen numbers according to the basic conservation of momentum equation wheaton 2017 deduced the relationships between shale permeability and pressure young s modulus a measure of shale elasticity and poisson s ratio yang and yu 2020 studied the mobility of water in shale nanopores discussed the change in permeability with the pressure gradient and obtained the relationship between mobility and permeability the mercury intrusion curves and gas method are commonly used on cores or crushed samples in the laboratory to measure the permeability of rock samples with extremely low permeability cui et al 2009 whether in field applications or laboratory experiments the influence of adsorption on permeability cannot be ignored and becomes a major problem perera et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 perera 2017 an experimental method for simultaneously measuring the adsorption and permeability of rocks was proposed by zhao et al 2019 in their experimental method ch4 adsorption capacity was obtained by the volume method permeability was calculated based on the pressure difference caused by gas diffusion cui et al 2009 expanded several methods of measuring permeability and diffusivity considering gas adsorption the pulse attenuation method and crushed sample gas method with a modified adsorption phase as well as the method for determining permeability or diffusivity using field core desorption test data wang and yu 2019 measured shale permeability by using the methane adsorption experiment process of crushed samples in their subsequent studies the same method was used to compare and analyze the permeability of dry and partially saturated shale samples wang and yu 2020 in this study we used a water vapor adsorption experiment to determine the water vapor permeability in shale note that the permeability measured in this article is actually the phase permeability or effective permeability of water vapor it reflects the nature of not only the shale itself but also the water vapor and its distribution in shale the effective water vapor permeability in shale has not been sufficiently studied to date the adsorption and permeability characteristics of water vapor under dynamic humidity have not been comprehensively studied the novelty of this study is that the relationship between water vapor permeability and dynamic adsorption is investigated to better understand the effect of adsorption on permeability in shale reservoirs in this paper the permeability and adsorption of water vapor in shales were studied and a method for permeability calculation using dynamic water vapor adsorption data was presented prior to the experiments the physicochemical characteristics of three shale samples were analyzed the permeability was calculated throughout the experimental process the relationship between permeability and water vapor adsorption was established the amount of water vapor adsorption is correlated with the compositional structural characteristics based on the calculation results of the water film thickness the reasons for the permeability loss were analyzed furthermore the degree of permeability reduction during the adsorption process was analyzed and studied 2 experimental method 2 1 samples and their chemical physical characterization the shale samples used in this study were collected from the shihuigou area in the eastern qaidam basin china they are from the carboniferous shale drilled in the zk1 1 core this basin with abundant resources is located in the northwestern part of qinghai province china the qaidam basin has attracted extensive attention because it is rich in mineral resources and has zones of oil and gas accumulation li et al 2015 the sampling depths of the three shale samples s1 s2 and s3 are 509 82 m 576 88 m and 596 45 m respectively the samples were crushed into 200 mesh powder for physicochemical characteristics testing and water vapor adsorption experimentation 2 1 1 shale composition analyses the mineral composition of the crushed shale samples was analyzed according to the standard sy t 5163 2010 the analysis method adopted was x ray diffraction xrd using a d max rb x ray diffractometer the percentages of quartz calcite dolomite plagioclase pyrite potash feldspar and siderite were obtained by xrd the percentage of total clay minerals and the relative percentages of illite smectite mixed layer illite kaolinite and chlorite were also measured the total organic carbon toc content is an essential parameter for evaluating the gas storage capacity of shale formations wang et al 2013 kenomore et al 2017 according to the gb t 19145 2003 standard the toc content of the samples was measured with a leco sc 144dr carbon sulfur analyzer table 1 lists the analysis results of the shale samples including their toc contents main mineral compositions and clay mineral total and relative contents 2 1 2 pore size distribution pores can be divided into three grades micropores diameter 2 nm mesopores 2 nm diameter 50 nm and macropores diameter 50 nm which are based on the classification of pores according to the size of the pore diameter by the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac sing 1985 sangwichien et al 2002 mercury intrusion porosimetry mip is usually used to characterize the macropore size distribution this is because when the pore diameter is less than 3 nm some pore structure distortion may occur bustin et al 2008 peng et al 2012 kuila and prasad 2013 moreover high pressure mercury injection testing requires the sample to be dry which may have a negative impact on the pore structure of shales with a high clay content bustin et al 2008 in adsorption experiments under low pressure and specific temperature conditions nitrogen and carbon dioxide molecules can enter mesopores and micropores respectively clarkson et al 2013 wang and yu 2016 therefore in this study the distribution of macropores mesopores and micropores was measured by mip experiments low pressure n2 adsorption and low pressure co2 adsorption respectively in accordance with the standard gb t 21650 1 2008 a pore master gt 60 apparatus was used for mip the mercury intrusion pressures range from 0 8 psi to 30 000 psi the pore size distribution bulk density and porosity were obtained based on mip experimental data giesche 2006 li et al 2015 the experimental temperature of the low pressure n2 adsorption was 77 k 196 c the pressure was lower than 1 27 bar and the device used was the autosorb iq station 1 instrument in addition this experiment was based on the gb t 21650 2 and gb t 21650 3 standards the distribution of the pore size and surface area of the mesopores were obtained by analyzing the experimental n2 adsorption data the method of calculating the specific surface area adopted was the brunauer emmet teller bet equation based on bet multilayer adsorption theory which is the most popular method for measuring the specific surface area of porous solids de lange et al 2014 the theory for analyzing the pore size distribution at the micropore and mesopore scales is based on the density functional theory dft molecular model which is considered to be an accurate method do and do 2003 the low pressure co2 adsorption experiments were performed at 273 k 0 c the experimental device used was a nova station a instrument the relative pressure of the experiments was controlled in the range of 0 0 03 li et al 2015 relative pressure is the ratio of the pressure of a gas to its saturation pressure the pore size distribution and specific surface area of the micropores were analyzed by dft based on the experimental data of low pressure co2 adsorption the microstructural characteristics of shale samples s1 s2 and s3 are exhibited in fig 1 and table 2 the pore types of these three samples are mainly mesopores accounting for more than 70 of the total pore volume and the mesopore volumes follow the order of s3 s2 s1 among the three shale samples s2 has the largest specific surface area 8 219 m2 g followed by s1 7 677 m2 g and s3 7 015 m2 g 2 2 adsorption and permeability determination 2 2 1 water vapor adsorption the water vapor adsorption experiment was based on the static pressure method high purity helium was used as the probe gas and its adsorption was ignored himeno et al 2005 the experimental device is shown in fig 2 the relative humidity monitoring range of the device is 0 100 and the allowable experimental temperature and pressure ranges are 273 333 k and 0 10 mpa respectively the experimental device is composed of a gas injection pressurization system gas storage adsorption system exhaust vacuum system data acquisition system and constant temperature system the core of the device is two closed cells the reference cell and the adsorption cell both cells are connected with pressure sensors and the accuracy is 0 001 mpa in addition the adsorption cell is connected with a temperature humidity probe and the accuracy is 0 01 c and 0 01 the experimental temperature was 40 c and the relative error was 0 2 c the internal volumes of the reference cell and the adsorption cell are 66 0425 cm3 and 46 6598 cm3 respectively obtained by the helium displacement method li et al 2015 the water vapor was derived from the evaporation of deionized water 6 ml to obtain the amount of water vapor adsorption reference experiments of liquid water evaporation relw fig 2 1 were performed without samples and under the same other conditions as the adsorption experiments fig 2 2 before the water vapor adsorption experiments the crushed samples were dried 105 c to remove impurities at the beginning of the experiment the gas storage adsorption system was vacuumed first and then high purity helium was injected into the reference cell the stabilization time lasted 4 h after that deionized water and the sample box containing shale samples were put into the adsorption cell valve v3 was opened to allow the gas to flow from the reference cell into the adsorption cell during the experiment the water evaporation rate gradually decreased with the increase of the relative humidity and the water vapor adsorption rate decreased with the increase of the adsorption amount in the later stage of the experiment the water vapor adsorption rate and the water evaporation rate tended to be stable and approximately equal during the first hour of the experiment the pressure was monitored every 1 s and the temperature and relative humidity were monitored every 5 s then the recording interval was changed to 10 s the water vapor permeability was calculated based on the experimental data of the process the experiment was terminated when the relative humidity increment within 1 h was less than 0 3 the moisture content of the sample was directly weighed by an electronic balance the above experimental steps were repeated in turn according to the preset pressure to obtain the amount of water vapor adsorption the gas pressure affects the saturated vapor pressure of water to obtain the saturated vapor pressure of water under different helium pressures the following derivation is given when water and water vapor are in equilibrium the chemical potentials of the two phases are equal 1 μ l μ g where μ l and μ g are the chemical potentials of the liquid phase and gas phase respectively j mol if there are gases other than water vapor in the gas phase above the aqueous solution the total pressure p t of the aqueous solution is not equal to the water vapor pressure when the aqueous solution and its vapor reach equilibrium

considered combined with darcy s law and the mass conservation law a mathematical model for permeability calculation was established considering darcy s flow with water vapor adsorption assuming that the shale particle is a homogeneous sphere with a constant porosity φ a small cubic unit is taken out of the particle whose length width and height are δ x δ y and δ z respectively as shown in fig 3

a is the final total amount of water vapor adsorption and w a is the water vapor adsorption amount at the time of calculation if the total void volume of the sample chamber is much larger than that of

relative humidity increases penman 1948 derived the equation of the evaporation rate of the free water surface when other conditions remain unchanged this equation can be written as e a b e a e a a b e a 1 r h where a and b are constants and e a is the saturated vapor pressure the evaporation rate is negatively linearly related to the relative humidity when the atmospheric pressure and other conditions remain unchanged wang et al 2015 confirmed this conclusion by experimental measurement the evaporation rate is a function of relative humidity in this paper we obtained through a series of experiments at different helium pressures that the evaporation rate of water is a function of relative humidity these results are in good agreement with the exponential equation 41 v e a 1 e r h b 1 a 2 e r h b 2 a 3 where a 1 a 2 a 3 b 1 and b 2 are fitting parameters the fitting curve is shown in fig 4 and the fitting equation is shown in table 3 these fitting equations are the key to calculating the water vapor adsorption amount 3 2 water vapor adsorption fig 5 shows the calculation results of the amount of water evaporation and free vapor in the adsorption cell of the adsorption experiment according to the principle of mass conservation the evaporation of the liquid water is equal to the sum of the free amount and adsorption amount of water vapor therefore the evaporation of water is greater than the free amount of water vapor after the adsorption reaches equilibrium the sample is removed from the adsorption cell and weighed immediately to determine the equilibrium adsorption amount of water vapor for the shale samples the duration and adsorption amount weighing method at equilibrium are shown in table 4 the water vapor adsorption amounts determined by the weighing method and the calculation method mentioned in section 2 2 1 were compared as shown in fig 6 the deviation is within 5 the water vapor adsorption experiments were carried out at three different equilibrium pressures of 1 3 and 5 mpa fig 6 also shows that as the pressure increases the amount of water vapor adsorption decreases and the water vapor adsorption amount for s1 is the largest followed by s2 and s3 the water vapor adsorption amounts for the three shale samples are shown in fig 7 the adsorption process curves are s shaped the adsorption rate first increases then decreases and eventually approaches zero 3 3 permeability calculation the water vapor permeability in the shale sample was calculated by eq 40 in our experiment the change in the pressure of the water vapor at each recording interval is very small therefore we calculated the permeability of the entire water vapor adsorption process the sample porosity can be regarded as a constant from the perspective that the maximum adsorbed volume is far less than the total pore volume wang and yu 2019 the larger the total pore volume of the adsorption cell is than the total gas storage volume of the sample particles that is the larger the k c the smaller the pressure change of the adsorption cell during the experiment and the more accurate the model fitting is moreover the larger k c is the more practical eq 38 is according to cui et al 2009 and wang and yu 2019 if k c is greater than 50 the fitting result can be considered accurate we share their views in this experiment the fitting result of eq 40 is accurate note that the amount of free water vapor in this experiment is continuously increasing so k a is no longer less than 0 05 the water vapor permeability was calculated from the second recorded time point of the experiment this is because the initial gas density required for the permeability calculation process was calculated from the data at the time of the first recording the variation in water vapor permeability over time is shown in fig 8 before 1000s the permeability decreases rapidly then becomes slower and finally stabilizes the plot of the change in permeability with time in the later stage of the experiment was enlarged fig 8 and compared with that in the previous stage in the early stage of the adsorption experiment the higher the pressure is the lower the permeability while in the adsorption equilibrium stage the permeability increases with increasing pressure the two vertical lines in each figure of fig 8 mark the boundaries of the initial stage and the equilibrium stage respectively the permeability of the early stage and the permeability averaged over the whole experiment time were calculated and are shown in table 5 table 6 shows the calculation results and related parameters of water vapor permeability when the experiment is in equilibrium the initial permeability and equilibrium permeability are the average permeabilities in the initial stage and equilibrium stage respectively it can be considered that the early permeability values represent the permeability of dry shale samples best and katsube 1995 pointed out that the permeability of shale ranges from 10 22 to 10 18 m2 i e 10 3 10 7 md in this study the initial equilibrium and average water vapor permeability ranges of the three shale samples are 2 8692 10 3 1 3760 10 3 md 3 4824 10 7 5 8850 10 7 md and 5 3894 10 4 9 5482 10 4 md respectively 4 discussion 4 1 relationship between the permeability and adsorption of water vapor the relationship between permeability and water vapor adsorption is shown in fig 9 the permeability is negatively correlated with the amount of water vapor adsorption and tends to be stable when water vapor adsorption equilibrium is achieved the relationship between permeability and water vapor adsorption amount is in accordance with the exponential equation 42 k e a b w a c w a 2 where a b and c are fitting parameters the corresponding fitting equation and correlation coefficient are shown in table 7 the permeability decreased significantly by more than an order of magnitude with increasing water vapor adsorption the detailed permeability reduction is discussed in section 4 2 wang and yu 2020 performed methane adsorption experiments on dry and partially saturated shale samples and found that the permeability of dry shale is higher than that of wet shale the permeability of samples decreases with increasing water saturation and the relationship between permeability and water saturation is exponential note that their definition of water saturation is actually the volume ratio of the adsorbed water to the shale sample in this paper we call this ratio the water content and the water saturation is defined as the volume ratio of the adsorbed water to all the pores in the sample fig 10 shows how permeability varies with water saturation the water saturation can be calculated according to the water vapor adsorption amount and pore size test results the functional relationship between permeability and water saturation also conforms to the form of eq 42 the permeability decreases continuously with increasing water saturation the reduction in the effective cross sectional areas of the pore throats and or the blockage of the pore throats by capillary water under effective stress causes the decrease in permeability with water saturation ghanizadeh et al 2014a 2014b with the increase in the water vapor adsorption in shale pores a water film gradually forms the gradually thickening water film will block the smaller pores so the permeability will be significantly reduced the distribution of the water film in the shale nanopores is discussed in detail in section 4 2 in addition the capillary action of expansive clay minerals such as smectite in shale amorim et al 2007 anderson et al 2010 and the water retention capacity of shale nanopores ferrari et al 2014 are important factors affecting permeability 4 2 distribution of adsorbed water in the pores water adsorbs on the shale and gradually forms a water film the calculation of water film thickness considering molecular forces and electrical forces has been studied by some scholars tokunaga 2012 dolinar and macuh 2016 li et al 2016a combined previous studies and presented a slit pore water film thickness calculation model that simultaneously considers molecular force electricity and structural force the disjoining pressure is used to indicate the surface interaction between the water film the solid phase and the gas phase in a thermodynamic system the relationship between disjoining pressure and relative humidity can be expressed as tuller et al 1999 churaev et al 2000 tadros 2013 43 π flat h v m l r t l n p w p s where π flat is the disjoining pressure of the water film in a single plane mpa h is the water film thickness nm and p w p s r h the total disjoining pressure on the flat surface is derjaguin et al 1987 starov et al 2007 44 π flat h π m h π e h π s h 44 1 π m h a h h 3 44 2 π e h ε ε 0 8 π ξ 1 ξ 2 2 h 2 44 3 π s h f e λ h where π m h π e h and π s h are the molecular force electrostatic force and structural force respectively mpa a h is the hamaker constant j ε is the relative permittivity of water dimensionless ε 0 is the vacuum permittivity f m ξ 1 and ξ 2 are the potentials of the shale water and water gas interfaces respectively v f is the structural strength coefficient n m2 and λ is the characteristic length of the water molecules nm different from the water film formed on a flat surface the water film formed in the capillary results in not only a disjoining pressure due to the action of the pore wall but also a capillary force caused by the curved water film the effective disjoining pressure in cylindrical pores is li et al 2017 45 π capillary h r r h π flat h p cc r r h π flat h γ r h where p cc is the cylindrical capillary pressure caused by the curved film mpa r is the radius of the capillary nm and γ is the gas water surface tension mn m combining eqs 43 44 and 45 the water film thickness h can be calculated and the parameter values used in the calculation are listed in table 8 melrose 1982 churaev 1995a 1995b 2003 takahashi and kovscek 2010 israelachvili 2011 in addition the water saturation s w of cylindrical pores is 46 s w r 2 r h 2 r 2 1 1 h r 2 the water film thickness in shale pores is related to the pore size and relative humidity li et al 2016a reported the water film thickness and water saturation in different pore sizes under different equilibrium relative humidities and found that the pore width has little effect on the water film thickness of slit pores but has a significant effect on water saturation in their research when the relative humidity was near 1 slit pores smaller than 5 nm were filled with water and the water saturation was equal to 1 the water film thickness and water saturation in the larger pores increased rapidly ma and yu 2020 presented the relationship between the water film thickness and relative humidity of different cylindrical pore sizes when the relative humidity is greater than 90 the water film thickness in the pores within 10 nm reaches the maximum that is these pores are filled with water notably their water vapor adsorption experiments were based on the moisture balance method which uses different saturated salt solutions to control for different relative humidity conditions the water vapor adsorption experiment in this study was carried out at 40 c the water vapor in the adsorption cell originated from the evaporation of liquid deionized water analyze the distribution of adsorbed water in shale nanopores at the equilibrium of the experiment the relative humidity at water adsorption equilibrium is shown in table 9 the equilibrium relative humidity decreases with increasing experimental pressure eqs 45 and 46 were used to calculate the water film thickness and water saturation in the shale pores at each experimental equilibrium when the calculated water film thickness is greater than the pore radius the water film thickness is corrected to be equal to the pore radius as shown in fig 11 there is a maximum h max in the distribution of water film thickness with pore size the water film thickness increases with the pore diameter before the maximum point and the three lines coincide afterward the water film thickness first decreases and then stabilizes with increasing pore size and the smaller the pressure or the greater the equilibrium relative humidity the greater the water film thickness in addition the smaller the pressure is the larger the maximum point for sample s1 the maximum points of 1 3 and 5 mpa are 8 462 nm 4 57 nm and 3 656 nm respectively for sample s2 the maximum points are 8 462 nm 5 086 nm and 3 06 nm respectively for sample s3 the maximum points are 8 462 nm 5 285 nm and 3 298 nm respectively it should be noted that the maximum point is the pore size corresponding to the maximum water film thickness the maximum water film thicknesses are marked in fig 11 the abscissa of the point where the maximum water film thickness is located is the maximum point before the maximum point the water film thickness is equal to the pore radius the pore is filled with water and condensation occurs this condensation phenomenon can cause significant differences in the distribution of water saturation in pores with different pore sizes li et al 2016a wu and yu 2020 as shown in fig 12 the water saturation is equal to 1 before the maximum point and then gradually decreases when the water film blocks narrow pores it is not conducive to the permeation or diffusion of gas molecules if the water film thickness in the cylindrical pores is equal to the pore radius the pores are completely filled with water the maximum pore completely filled with water corresponds to the maximum point in fig 11 the maximum water film thickness h max is equal to half of the maximum point i e the corresponding pore radius the pores with pore sizes smaller than the maximum point in the figure were filled with water when adsorption equilibrium is reached there is a strong negative correlation between the maximum water film thickness and permeability as shown in fig 13 the larger the maximum water film thickness is the smaller the equilibrium permeability in other words the permeability of water vapor in shale decreases with increasing pore size blocked by water the more blocked pores there are the more serious the loss of shale pore network connectivity and the worse the permeability to describe the declining process of permeability because of vapor adsorption the rate of the initial permeability to the permeability at time t is referred to as the permeability reduction factor as shown in eq 47 here the permeability when t 10 s is taken as the initial permeability 47 f k k 0 k t where f k is the permeability reduction factor and k 0 and k t are the permeability at t 10 s and time t respectively md the permeability changes calculated according to eq 47 are shown in fig 14 the increase in f k reflects the loss of permeability permeability variation can be divided into three stages stages i ii and iii occurred at approximately 0 0 1 h 0 1 1 h and 1 42 h respectively the shape of the curves in fig 14 suggests that in the early stage the adsorption layer is thin almost no flow path is affected and the permeability decline is not obvious in stage ii with the accumulation of adsorbed water some small pores acting as pore throats in the flowing paths become blocked and the permeability declines rapidly the increase in the thickness of the water film leads to the shrinkage of the pore channels and obvious loss of connectivity in the later stage the adsorption layer thickens and gradually stabilizes pores with a radius smaller than the maximum water film thickness are blocked capillary condensation occurs the permeability further decreases and then tends to be stable fig 14 shows that the f k value reaches the maximum stable value of 3414 33 12520 12 when the water vapor adsorption reaches equilibrium this indicates that the equilibrium permeability is 3 4 orders of magnitude lower than the reference value the f k value at equilibrium f kmax can reflect the permeability reduction fig 15 shows that the degree of permeability reduction is closely related to the maximum water film thickness the larger the pore size blocked by the adsorbed water film is the greater the permeability loss 4 3 differences in permeability and water vapor adsorption between samples among samples s1 s2 and s3 s1 has the greatest amount of water vapor adsorption and s3 has the least fig 6 this conclusion corresponds with the test results of the clay minerals the content of clay minerals has a strong positive correlation with the amount of adsorption fig 16 a demonstrating that shales with relatively high clay mineral contents have greater water vapor adsorption amounts wang and yu 2020 clay minerals 24 9 54 3 and quartz 14 48 are the two main components of these shale samples table 1 illite and smectite with strong hydrophilicity are the main clay minerals accounting for 18 426 33 666 of the shale mineral composition the relation between the content of illite and smectite and the water vapor adsorption amount is shown in fig 16 b the influence of quartz and clay minerals on the water vapor adsorption amount exhibits the opposite trend as illustrated in fig 16 c the water vapor adsorption amount is negatively correlated with the quartz content fig 17 shows the relationships between the amount of water vapor adsorption and the total pore volume and specific surface area sang et al 2019 experimentally found that a relatively large total pore volume and or specific surface area result in a large water adsorption amount for shale containing insignificant amounts of expansive clay comparing the graphs in fig 16 and fig 17 the content of clay minerals has a greater influence on the water vapor adsorption amount than on the total pore volume and or specific surface area this can be attributed to the strong hydrophilicity and large internal specific surface area of clay minerals mainly smectite sang et al 2018 the initial permeability at the beginning of the experiment can be considered the permeability of dry shale samples fig 18 a shows the relationship between the initial permeability and macropore volume in general the initial permeability is positively related to macropore volume although the correlation is poor at 3 mpa and 5 mpa moreover there is no correlation between the initial permeability and other components wang and yu 2019 reported similar results the permeability of dry shale is mainly related to the proportion of the macropore volume for wet shales as discussed in section 4 1 permeability and the adsorption amount water saturation have a strong exponential relationship as shown in fig 18 b the equilibrium permeability of water vapor adsorption increases with increasing mesopore volume possibly because the volume of mesopores is larger table 2 and fewer pores are blocked similarly no correlation was found between equilibrium permeability and other components such as mineral content and total pore volume the equilibrium permeability is mainly affected by water saturation and mesopore volume 5 conclusions an experimental approach is presented to investigate the permeability and adsorption of water vapor in shale three shale samples from the carboniferous formation of the qaidam basin china were tested by using this method based on the experimental measurements and calculation results the following conclusions were reached the water vapor permeability of shale samples was 10 3 10 7 md the permeability decreased with time and reached stability when adsorption equilibrium was achieved the initial permeability considered the permeability of dry samples in the early stage of the experiment and equilibrium permeability were 2 8692 10 3 1 3760 10 3 md and 3 4824 10 7 5 8850 10 7 md respectively the average permeability during the whole adsorption process was 5 3894 10 4 9 5482 10 4 md the amount of water vapor adsorption gradually increased with time and eventually stabilized the equilibrium water vapor adsorption amount was between 0 5579 and 1 0492 mmol g and the equilibrium time was 36 42 h the adsorption amount decreased with increasing total pressure at equilibrium water vapor adsorption was positively related to clay mainly illite and smectite content total pore volume and specific surface area and negatively correlated with quartz content the clay mineral content had a greater impact on the water vapor adsorption amount than the total pore volume and or specific surface area the relationship between permeability and water vapor adsorption amount was described by the exponential equation k e a b w a c w a 2 where a b and c are fitting parameters the permeability at water vapor adsorption equilibrium was 3 4 orders of magnitude lower than that in the initial stage the decrease in pore size and blockage of pore throats in the process of water vapor adsorption were the reasons for the permeability reduction the permeability of water vapor in shale decreased with increasing pore size blocked by the water film there was a maximum in the distribution of water film thickness with pore size the permeability reduction was closely related to the maximum water film thickness the larger the maximum pore diameter blocked by the water film was the greater the permeability loss for the three shale samples the maximum pore diameters of condensation at 1 3 and 5 mpa were 8 462 nm 4 57 5 285 nm and 3 06 3 656 nm respectively declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests

3357,the transport of water vapor in shale mudrocks plays an important role in many natural and engineering issues such as the global water cycle and shale gas production however the permeability of water vapor in shale is not well understood an experimental approach to investigate the water vapor permeability in shale is presented in this paper water vapor sorption was conducted under the dynamic relative humidity condition in which the vapor evaporation was generated from the liquid distilled water at different gas helium pressures three crushed samples of carboniferous shale from the eastern qaidam basin china were obtained and tested in the experiments the adsorption process of water vapor into the crushed shale was observed and the permeability of water vapor through shale was calculated with the data collected during the dynamic water vapor adsorption process the results show that the permeability decreases with increasing water vapor adsorption the relationship between permeability and water vapor adsorption amount fits an exponential equation well the permeability at the equilibrium of water vapor adsorption is 3 4 orders of magnitude lower than that in the initial stage of water vapor adsorption the decrease in pore size and resulting pore throat blockage cause this permeability reduction the water film thickness and water saturation in the shale pores at adsorption equilibrium were estimated the permeability reduction is closely related to the maximum water film thickness the larger the range of pores blocked by the water film is the more obvious the permeability reduction keywords water vapor adsorption permeability water film thickness permeability reduction 1 introduction water and the global water cycle play an important role in sustaining human survival and ecological balance the global water cycle refers to the hydrological cycle among seawater atmospheric water surface water and groundwater luo et al 2021 which consists of physicochemical processes such as precipitation runoff infiltration plant uptake groundwater flow evaporation condensation sublimation transpiration water vapor transport and anthropogenic actions abbott et al 2019 allan et al 2020 yin and roderick 2020 water vapor transport and dynamic processes can dominate regional mean precipitation changes gimeno et al 2012 in the natural state juvenile water retained in the form of adsorption and condensation is common in shale formations bowker 2007 the transportation evaporation condensation del genio et al 1996 luz and barkan 2010 and adsorption of water in shale have an impact on the global hydrological cycle in recent years natural gas extracted from shale reservoirs has become a significant energy resource which has made researchers worldwide interested in the properties of shale such as its pore structure characteristics labani et al 2013 wang and yu 2017 fluid transport characteristics freeman et al 2011 gao et al 2016 sang et al 2020 methane adsorption capacity billemont et al 2013 ma and yu 2020 and water vapor adsorption characteristics shen et al 2018 cihan et al 2019 yang et al 2021 multistage hydraulic stimulation requiring a large amount of water is a key technology for shale gas development hughes 2013 ghanbari and dehghanpour 2016 using this technology to extract shale gas large amounts of water can be trapped in shale formations with poor physical properties engelder et al 2014 makhanov et al 2014 shales exhibit a dense structure with nanoscale pores loucks et al 2009 retained water usually exists or migrates in the pore space of shale in an adsorbed or free state which may strongly affect the gas storage capacity of the shale ji et al 2012 gasparik et al 2014 wang and yu 2016 wang et al 2018 and the gas transport through the nanoporous channels in the shale landry et al 2016 amann hildenbrand et al 2017 li et al 2019 therefore it is of great significance to understand the distribution and migration characteristics of water in shale nanopores water vapor is usually associated with shale gas in shale reservoirs vengosh et al 2014 li et al 2019 the adsorption capacity of water vapor in shale is stronger than that of methane which will reduce the reserves of methane in the formation vidic et al 2013 li et al 2016a ma and yu 2021 studying the characteristics of water vapor adsorption and distribution in shale pores is of great significance to the development of shale gas li et al 2017 and tokunaga et al 2017 found that as the amount of adsorbed water increases the adsorbed water will gradually condense the amount of water adsorbed on shale is positively correlated with the clay content of the shale ross and marc bustin 2009 gasparik et al 2014 yang et al 2020 studied the water vapor adsorption characteristics of shale under various relative humidities by a gravimetric method determined the pore size distribution and discussed the change in methane adsorption capacity in shale under different relative humidity humidities yuan et al 2014a explored the interaction between water and shale samples on micro and macro scales and analyzed the storage and transportation mechanisms of water sang et al 2018 explained the adsorption behavior of water vapor in clay and shale samples by associating the mineral composition and pore distribution characteristics with the occurrence state of water in pores in addition many scholars have measured and fitted shale water vapor adsorption desorption isotherms tang et al 2017 sang et al 2018 2019 part of the research on water vapor adsorption is based on the moisture balance method of salt solutions with different relative humidities li et al 2016a 2016b and another part is based on the passage of wet dry gas in a closed adsorption tank to measure the mass change of the sample through a microbalance sang et al 2018 however there are few studies on water vapor adsorption with the presence of liquid water evaporation in the adsorption cell permeability is a very significant parameter in shale gas production and characterizes the fluid transport capacity shale permeability has been extensively studied in recent years javadpour 2009 derived the apparent permeability model of gas in nanopores by linearly superimposing knudsen diffusion and slip flow two transport mechanisms shi et al 2013 proposed nonlinear superposition of diffusion and slip flows by using weight coefficients to obtain permeability models under different knudsen numbers according to the basic conservation of momentum equation wheaton 2017 deduced the relationships between shale permeability and pressure young s modulus a measure of shale elasticity and poisson s ratio yang and yu 2020 studied the mobility of water in shale nanopores discussed the change in permeability with the pressure gradient and obtained the relationship between mobility and permeability the mercury intrusion curves and gas method are commonly used on cores or crushed samples in the laboratory to measure the permeability of rock samples with extremely low permeability cui et al 2009 whether in field applications or laboratory experiments the influence of adsorption on permeability cannot be ignored and becomes a major problem perera et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 perera 2017 an experimental method for simultaneously measuring the adsorption and permeability of rocks was proposed by zhao et al 2019 in their experimental method ch4 adsorption capacity was obtained by the volume method permeability was calculated based on the pressure difference caused by gas diffusion cui et al 2009 expanded several methods of measuring permeability and diffusivity considering gas adsorption the pulse attenuation method and crushed sample gas method with a modified adsorption phase as well as the method for determining permeability or diffusivity using field core desorption test data wang and yu 2019 measured shale permeability by using the methane adsorption experiment process of crushed samples in their subsequent studies the same method was used to compare and analyze the permeability of dry and partially saturated shale samples wang and yu 2020 in this study we used a water vapor adsorption experiment to determine the water vapor permeability in shale note that the permeability measured in this article is actually the phase permeability or effective permeability of water vapor it reflects the nature of not only the shale itself but also the water vapor and its distribution in shale the effective water vapor permeability in shale has not been sufficiently studied to date the adsorption and permeability characteristics of water vapor under dynamic humidity have not been comprehensively studied the novelty of this study is that the relationship between water vapor permeability and dynamic adsorption is investigated to better understand the effect of adsorption on permeability in shale reservoirs in this paper the permeability and adsorption of water vapor in shales were studied and a method for permeability calculation using dynamic water vapor adsorption data was presented prior to the experiments the physicochemical characteristics of three shale samples were analyzed the permeability was calculated throughout the experimental process the relationship between permeability and water vapor adsorption was established the amount of water vapor adsorption is correlated with the compositional structural characteristics based on the calculation results of the water film thickness the reasons for the permeability loss were analyzed furthermore the degree of permeability reduction during the adsorption process was analyzed and studied 2 experimental method 2 1 samples and their chemical physical characterization the shale samples used in this study were collected from the shihuigou area in the eastern qaidam basin china they are from the carboniferous shale drilled in the zk1 1 core this basin with abundant resources is located in the northwestern part of qinghai province china the qaidam basin has attracted extensive attention because it is rich in mineral resources and has zones of oil and gas accumulation li et al 2015 the sampling depths of the three shale samples s1 s2 and s3 are 509 82 m 576 88 m and 596 45 m respectively the samples were crushed into 200 mesh powder for physicochemical characteristics testing and water vapor adsorption experimentation 2 1 1 shale composition analyses the mineral composition of the crushed shale samples was analyzed according to the standard sy t 5163 2010 the analysis method adopted was x ray diffraction xrd using a d max rb x ray diffractometer the percentages of quartz calcite dolomite plagioclase pyrite potash feldspar and siderite were obtained by xrd the percentage of total clay minerals and the relative percentages of illite smectite mixed layer illite kaolinite and chlorite were also measured the total organic carbon toc content is an essential parameter for evaluating the gas storage capacity of shale formations wang et al 2013 kenomore et al 2017 according to the gb t 19145 2003 standard the toc content of the samples was measured with a leco sc 144dr carbon sulfur analyzer table 1 lists the analysis results of the shale samples including their toc contents main mineral compositions and clay mineral total and relative contents 2 1 2 pore size distribution pores can be divided into three grades micropores diameter 2 nm mesopores 2 nm diameter 50 nm and macropores diameter 50 nm which are based on the classification of pores according to the size of the pore diameter by the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac sing 1985 sangwichien et al 2002 mercury intrusion porosimetry mip is usually used to characterize the macropore size distribution this is because when the pore diameter is less than 3 nm some pore structure distortion may occur bustin et al 2008 peng et al 2012 kuila and prasad 2013 moreover high pressure mercury injection testing requires the sample to be dry which may have a negative impact on the pore structure of shales with a high clay content bustin et al 2008 in adsorption experiments under low pressure and specific temperature conditions nitrogen and carbon dioxide molecules can enter mesopores and micropores respectively clarkson et al 2013 wang and yu 2016 therefore in this study the distribution of macropores mesopores and micropores was measured by mip experiments low pressure n2 adsorption and low pressure co2 adsorption respectively in accordance with the standard gb t 21650 1 2008 a pore master gt 60 apparatus was used for mip the mercury intrusion pressures range from 0 8 psi to 30 000 psi the pore size

pressure was lower than 1 27 bar and the device used was the autosorb iq station 1 instrument in addition this experiment was based on the gb t 21650 2 and gb t 21650 3 standards the distribution of the pore size and surface area of the mesopores were obtained by analyzing the experimental n2 adsorption data the method of calculating the specific surface area adopted was the brunauer emmet teller bet equation based on bet multilayer adsorption theory which is the most popular method for measuring the specific surface area of porous solids de lange et al 2014 the theory for analyzing the pore size distribution at the micropore and mesopore scales is based on the density functional theory dft molecular model which is considered to be an accurate method do and do 2003 the low pressure co2

2015 relative pressure is the ratio of the pressure of a gas to its saturation pressure the pore size distribution and specific surface area of the micropores were analyzed by dft based on the experimental data of low pressure co2 adsorption the microstructural characteristics of shale samples s1 s2 and s3 are exhibited in fig 1 and table 2 the pore types of these three samples are mainly mesopores accounting for more than 70 of the total pore volume and the mesopore volumes follow the order of s3 s2 s1 among the three shale samples s2 has the largest specific surface area 8 219 m2 g followed by s1 7 677 m2 g and s3 7 015 m2 g 2 2 adsorption and permeability determination 2 2 1 water vapor adsorption the water vapor adsorption experiment was based on the static pressure method high purity helium was used as the probe gas and its adsorption was ignored himeno et al 2005 the experimental device is shown in fig 2 the relative humidity monitoring range of the device is 0 100

displacement method li et al 2015 the water vapor was derived from the evaporation of deionized water 6 ml to obtain the amount of water vapor adsorption reference experiments of liquid water evaporation relw fig 2 1 were performed without samples and under the same other conditions as the adsorption experiments fig 2 2 before the water vapor adsorption experiments the crushed samples were dried 105 c to remove impurities at the beginning of the experiment the gas storage adsorption system was vacuumed first and then high purity helium was injected into the reference cell the stabilization time lasted 4 h after that deionized water and the sample box containing shale samples were put into the adsorption cell valve v3 was opened to allow the gas to flow from the reference cell into the adsorption cell during the experiment the water evaporation rate gradually decreased with the increase of the relative humidity and the water vapor adsorption rate decreased with the increase of the adsorption amount in the later stage of the experiment the water vapor adsorption rate and the water evaporation rate tended to be stable and approximately equal during the first hour of the experiment the pressure was monitored every 1 s and the temperature and relative humidity were monitored every 5 s then the recording interval was changed to 10 s the water vapor permeability was calculated based on the experimental data of the process the experiment was terminated when the relative humidity increment within 1 h was less than 0 3 the moisture content of the sample was directly weighed by an electronic balance the above experimental steps were repeated in turn according to the preset pressure to obtain the amount of water vapor adsorption the gas pressure affects the saturated vapor pressure of water to obtain the saturated vapor pressure of water under different helium pressures the following derivation is given when water and water vapor are in equilibrium the chemical potentials of the two phases are equal 1 μ l μ g where μ l and μ g are the chemical potentials of the liquid phase and gas phase respectively j mol if there are gases other than water vapor in the gas phase above the aqueous solution the total pressure p t of the aqueous solution is not equal to the water vapor pressure when the aqueous solution and its vapor reach equilibrium

porous media can be described by partial differential equations cui et al 2009 wang and yu 2019 water vapor was the research gas in this experiment and the compression of shale particles was not considered combined with darcy s law and the mass conservation law a mathematical model for permeability calculation was established considering darcy s flow with water vapor adsorption assuming that the shale particle is a homogeneous sphere with a constant porosity φ a small cubic unit is taken out of the particle whose length width and height are δ x δ y and δ z respectively as shown in fig 3

a is the final total amount of water vapor adsorption and w a is the water vapor adsorption amount at the time of calculation if the total void volume of the sample chamber is much larger than that of

relative humidity increases penman 1948 derived the equation of the evaporation rate of the free water surface when other conditions remain unchanged this equation can be written as e a b e a e a a b e a 1 r h where a and b are constants and e a is the saturated vapor pressure the evaporation rate is negatively linearly related to the relative humidity when the atmospheric pressure and other conditions remain unchanged wang et al 2015 confirmed this conclusion by experimental measurement the evaporation rate is a function of relative humidity in this paper we obtained through a series of experiments at different helium pressures that the evaporation rate of water is a function of relative humidity these results are in good agreement with the exponential equation 41 v e a 1 e r h b 1 a 2 e r h b 2 a 3 where a 1 a 2 a 3 b 1 and b 2 are fitting parameters the fitting curve is shown in fig 4 and the fitting equation is shown in table 3 these fitting equations are the key to calculating the water vapor adsorption amount 3 2 water vapor adsorption fig 5 shows the calculation results of the amount of water evaporation and free vapor in the adsorption cell of the adsorption experiment according to the principle of mass conservation the evaporation of the liquid water is equal to the sum of the free amount and adsorption amount of water vapor therefore the evaporation of water is greater than the free amount of water vapor after the adsorption reaches equilibrium the sample is removed from the adsorption cell and weighed immediately to determine the equilibrium adsorption amount of water vapor for the shale samples the duration and adsorption amount weighing method at equilibrium are shown in table 4 the water vapor adsorption amounts determined by the weighing method and the calculation method mentioned in section 2 2 1 were compared as shown in fig 6 the deviation is within 5 the water vapor adsorption experiments were carried out at three different equilibrium pressures of 1 3 and 5 mpa fig 6 also shows that as the pressure increases the amount of water vapor adsorption decreases and the water vapor adsorption amount for s1 is the largest followed by s2 and s3 the water vapor adsorption amounts for the three shale samples are shown in fig 7 the adsorption process curves are s shaped the adsorption rate first increases then decreases and eventually approaches zero 3 3 permeability calculation the water vapor permeability in the shale sample was calculated by eq 40 in our experiment the change in the pressure of the water vapor at each recording interval is very small therefore we calculated the permeability of the entire water vapor adsorption process the sample porosity can be regarded as a constant from the perspective that the maximum adsorbed volume is far less than the total pore volume wang and yu 2019 the larger the total pore volume of the adsorption cell is than the total gas storage volume of the sample particles that is the larger the k c the smaller the pressure change of the adsorption cell during the experiment and the more accurate the model fitting is moreover the larger k c is the more practical eq 38 is according to cui et al 2009 and wang and yu 2019 if k c is greater than 50 the fitting result can be considered accurate we share their views in this experiment the fitting result of eq 40 is accurate note that the amount of free water vapor in this experiment is continuously increasing so k a is no longer less than 0 05 the water vapor permeability was calculated from the second recorded time point of the experiment this is because the initial gas density required for the permeability calculation process was calculated from the data at the time of the first recording the variation in water vapor permeability over time is shown in fig 8 before 1000s the permeability decreases rapidly then becomes slower and finally stabilizes the plot of the change in permeability with time in the later stage of the experiment was enlarged fig 8 and compared with that in the previous stage in the early stage of the adsorption experiment the higher the pressure is the lower the permeability while in the adsorption equilibrium stage the permeability increases with increasing pressure the two vertical lines in each figure of fig 8 mark the boundaries of the initial stage and the equilibrium stage respectively the permeability of the early stage and the permeability averaged over the whole experiment time were calculated and are shown in table 5 table 6 shows the calculation results and related parameters of water vapor permeability when the experiment is in equilibrium the initial permeability and equilibrium permeability are the average permeabilities in the initial stage and equilibrium stage respectively it can be considered that the early permeability values represent the permeability of dry shale samples best and katsube 1995 pointed out that the permeability of shale ranges from 10 22 to 10 18 m2 i e 10 3 10 7 md in this study the initial equilibrium and average water vapor permeability ranges of the three shale samples are 2 8692 10 3 1 3760 10 3 md 3 4824 10 7 5 8850 10 7 md and 5 3894 10 4 9 5482 10 4 md respectively 4 discussion 4 1 relationship between the permeability and adsorption of water vapor the relationship between permeability and water vapor adsorption is shown in fig 9 the permeability is negatively correlated with the amount of water vapor adsorption and tends to be stable when water vapor adsorption equilibrium is achieved the relationship between permeability and water vapor adsorption amount is in accordance with the exponential equation 42 k e a b w a c w a 2 where a b and c are fitting parameters the corresponding fitting equation and correlation coefficient are shown in table 7 the permeability decreased significantly by more than an order of magnitude with increasing water vapor adsorption the detailed permeability reduction is discussed in section 4 2 wang and yu 2020 performed methane adsorption experiments on dry and partially saturated shale samples and found that the permeability of dry shale is higher than that of wet shale the permeability of samples decreases with increasing water saturation and the relationship between permeability and water saturation is exponential note that their definition of water saturation is actually the volume ratio of the adsorbed water to the shale sample in this paper we call this ratio the water content and the water saturation is defined as the volume ratio of the adsorbed water to all the pores in the sample fig 10 shows how permeability varies with water saturation the water saturation can be calculated according to the water vapor adsorption amount and pore size test results the functional relationship between permeability and water saturation also conforms to the form of eq 42 the permeability decreases continuously with increasing water saturation the reduction in the effective cross sectional areas of the pore throats and or the blockage of the pore throats by capillary water under effective stress causes the decrease in permeability with water saturation ghanizadeh et al 2014a 2014b with the increase in the water vapor adsorption in shale pores a water film gradually forms the gradually thickening water film will block the smaller pores so the permeability will be significantly reduced the distribution of the water film in the shale nanopores is discussed in detail in section 4 2 in addition the capillary action of expansive clay minerals such as smectite in shale amorim et al 2007 anderson et al 2010 and the water retention capacity of shale nanopores ferrari et al 2014 are important factors affecting permeability 4 2 distribution of adsorbed water in the pores water adsorbs on the shale and gradually forms a water film the calculation of water film thickness considering molecular forces and electrical forces has been studied by some scholars tokunaga 2012 dolinar and macuh 2016 li et al 2016a combined previous studies and presented a slit pore water film thickness calculation model that simultaneously considers molecular force electricity and structural force the disjoining pressure is used to indicate the surface interaction between the water film the solid phase and the gas phase in a thermodynamic system the relationship between disjoining pressure and relative humidity can be expressed as tuller et al 1999 churaev et al 2000 tadros 2013 43 π flat h v m l r t l n p w p s where π flat is the disjoining pressure of the water film in a single plane mpa h is the water film thickness nm and p w p s r h the total disjoining pressure on the flat surface is derjaguin et al 1987 starov et al 2007 44 π flat h π m h π e h π s h 44 1 π m h a h h 3 44 2 π e h ε ε 0 8 π ξ 1 ξ 2 2 h 2 44 3 π s h f e λ h where π m h π e h and π s h are the molecular force electrostatic force and structural force respectively mpa a h is the hamaker constant j ε is the relative permittivity of water dimensionless ε 0 is the vacuum permittivity f m ξ 1 and ξ 2 are the potentials of the shale water and water gas interfaces respectively v f is the structural strength coefficient n m2 and λ is the characteristic length of the water molecules nm different from the water film formed on a flat surface the water film formed in the capillary results in not only a disjoining pressure due to the action of the pore wall but also a capillary force caused by the curved water film the effective disjoining pressure in cylindrical pores is li et al 2017 45 π capillary h r r h π flat h p cc r r h π flat h γ r h where p cc is the cylindrical capillary pressure caused by the curved film mpa r is the radius of the capillary nm and γ is the gas water surface tension mn m combining eqs 43 44 and 45 the water film thickness h can be calculated and the parameter values used in the calculation are listed in table 8 melrose 1982 churaev 1995a 1995b 2003 takahashi and kovscek 2010 israelachvili 2011 in addition the water saturation s w of cylindrical pores is 46 s w r 2 r h 2 r 2 1 1 h r 2 the water film thickness in shale pores is related to the pore size and relative humidity li et al 2016a reported the water film thickness and water saturation in different pore sizes under different equilibrium relative humidities and found that the pore width has little effect on the water film thickness of slit pores but has a significant effect on water saturation in their research when the relative humidity was near 1 slit pores smaller than 5 nm were filled with water and the water saturation was equal to 1 the water film thickness and water saturation in the larger pores increased rapidly ma and yu 2020 presented the relationship between the water film thickness and relative humidity of different cylindrical pore sizes when the relative humidity is greater than 90 the water film thickness in the pores within 10 nm reaches the maximum that is these pores are filled with water notably their water vapor adsorption experiments were based on the moisture balance method which uses different saturated salt solutions to control for different relative humidity conditions the water vapor adsorption experiment in this study was carried out at 40 c the water vapor in the adsorption cell originated from the evaporation of liquid deionized water analyze the distribution of adsorbed water in shale nanopores at the equilibrium of the experiment the relative humidity at water adsorption equilibrium is shown in table 9 the equilibrium relative humidity decreases with increasing experimental pressure eqs 45 and 46 were used to calculate the water film thickness and water saturation in the shale pores at each experimental equilibrium when the calculated water film thickness is greater than the pore radius the water film thickness is corrected to be equal to the pore radius as shown in fig 11 there is a maximum h max in the distribution of water film thickness with pore size the water film thickness increases with the pore diameter before the maximum point and the three lines coincide afterward the water film thickness first decreases and then stabilizes with increasing pore size and the smaller the pressure or the greater the equilibrium relative humidity the greater the water film thickness in addition the smaller the pressure is the larger the maximum point for sample s1 the maximum points of 1 3 and 5 mpa are 8 462 nm 4 57 nm and 3 656 nm respectively for sample s2 the maximum points are 8 462 nm 5 086 nm and 3 06 nm respectively for sample s3 the maximum points are 8 462 nm 5 285 nm and 3 298 nm respectively it should be noted that the maximum point is the pore size corresponding to the maximum water film thickness the maximum water film thicknesses are marked in fig 11 the abscissa of the point where the maximum water film thickness is located is the maximum point before the maximum point the water film thickness is equal to the pore radius the pore is filled with water and condensation occurs this condensation phenomenon can cause significant differences in the distribution of water saturation in pores with different pore sizes li et al 2016a wu and yu 2020 as shown in fig 12 the water saturation is equal to 1 before the maximum point and then gradually decreases when the water film blocks narrow pores it is not conducive to the permeation or diffusion of gas molecules if the water film thickness in the cylindrical pores is equal to the pore radius the pores are completely filled with water the maximum pore completely filled with water corresponds to the maximum point in fig 11 the maximum water film thickness h max is equal to half of the maximum point i e the corresponding pore radius the pores with pore sizes smaller than the maximum point in the figure were filled with water when adsorption equilibrium is reached there is a strong negative correlation between the maximum water film thickness and permeability as shown in fig 13 the larger the maximum water film thickness is the smaller the equilibrium permeability in other words the permeability of water vapor in shale decreases with increasing pore size blocked by water the more blocked pores there are the more serious the loss of shale pore network connectivity and the worse the permeability to describe the declining process of permeability because of vapor adsorption the rate of the initial permeability to the permeability at time t is referred to as the permeability reduction factor as shown in eq 47 here the permeability when t 10 s is taken as the initial permeability 47 f k k 0 k t where f k is the permeability reduction factor and k 0 and k t are the permeability at t 10 s and time t respectively md the permeability changes calculated according to eq 47 are shown in fig 14 the increase in f k reflects the loss of permeability permeability variation can be divided into three stages stages i ii and iii occurred at approximately 0 0 1 h 0 1 1 h and 1 42 h respectively the shape of the curves in fig 14 suggests that in the early stage the adsorption layer is thin almost no flow path is affected and the permeability decline is not obvious in stage ii with the accumulation of adsorbed water some small pores acting as pore throats in the flowing paths become blocked and the permeability declines rapidly the increase in the thickness of the water film leads to the shrinkage of the pore channels and obvious loss of connectivity in the later stage the adsorption layer thickens and gradually stabilizes pores with a radius smaller than the maximum water film thickness are blocked capillary condensation occurs the permeability further decreases and then tends to be stable fig 14 shows that the f k value reaches the maximum stable value of 3414 33 12520 12 when the water vapor adsorption reaches equilibrium this indicates that the equilibrium permeability is 3 4 orders of magnitude lower than the reference value the f k value at equilibrium f kmax can reflect the permeability reduction fig 15 shows that the degree of permeability reduction is closely related to the maximum water film thickness the larger the pore size blocked by the adsorbed water film is the greater the permeability loss 4 3 differences in permeability and water vapor adsorption between samples among samples s1 s2 and s3 s1 has the greatest amount of water vapor adsorption and s3 has the least fig 6 this conclusion corresponds with the test results of the clay minerals the content of clay minerals has a strong positive correlation with the amount of adsorption fig 16 a demonstrating that shales with relatively high clay mineral contents have greater water vapor adsorption amounts wang and yu 2020 clay minerals 24 9 54 3 and quartz 14 48 are the two main components of these shale samples table 1 illite and smectite with strong hydrophilicity are the main clay minerals accounting for 18 426 33 666 of the shale mineral composition the relation between the content of illite and smectite and the water vapor adsorption amount is shown in fig 16 b the influence of quartz and clay minerals on the water vapor adsorption amount exhibits the opposite trend as illustrated in fig 16 c the water vapor adsorption amount is negatively correlated with the quartz content fig 17 shows the relationships between the amount of water vapor adsorption and the total pore volume and specific surface area sang et al 2019 experimentally found that a relatively large total pore volume and or specific surface area result in a large water adsorption amount for shale containing insignificant amounts of expansive clay comparing the graphs in fig 16 and fig 17 the content of clay minerals has a greater influence on the water vapor adsorption amount than on the total pore volume and or specific surface area this can be attributed to the strong hydrophilicity and large internal specific surface area of clay minerals mainly smectite sang et al 2018 the initial permeability at the beginning of the experiment can be considered the permeability of dry shale samples fig 18 a shows the relationship between the initial permeability and macropore volume in general the initial permeability is positively related to macropore volume although the correlation is poor at 3 mpa and 5 mpa moreover there is no correlation between the initial permeability and other components wang and yu 2019 reported similar results the permeability of dry shale is mainly related to the proportion of the macropore volume for wet shales as discussed in section 4 1 permeability and the adsorption amount water saturation have a strong exponential relationship as shown in fig 18 b the equilibrium permeability of water vapor adsorption increases with increasing mesopore volume possibly because the volume of mesopores is larger table 2 and fewer pores are blocked similarly no correlation was found between equilibrium permeability and other components such as mineral content and total pore volume the equilibrium permeability is mainly affected by water saturation and mesopore volume 5 conclusions an experimental approach is presented to investigate the permeability and adsorption of water vapor in shale three shale samples from the carboniferous formation of the qaidam basin china were tested by using this method based on the experimental measurements and calculation results the following conclusions were reached the water vapor permeability of shale samples was 10 3 10 7 md the permeability decreased with time and reached stability when adsorption equilibrium was achieved the initial permeability considered the permeability of dry samples in the early stage of the experiment and equilibrium permeability were 2 8692 10 3 1 3760 10 3 md and 3 4824 10 7 5 8850 10 7 md respectively the average permeability during the whole adsorption process was 5 3894 10 4 9 5482 10 4 md the amount of water vapor adsorption gradually increased with time and eventually stabilized the equilibrium water vapor adsorption amount was between 0 5579 and 1 0492 mmol g and the equilibrium time was 36 42 h the adsorption amount decreased with increasing total pressure at equilibrium water vapor adsorption was positively related to clay mainly illite and smectite content total pore volume and specific surface area and negatively correlated with quartz content the clay mineral content had a greater impact on the water vapor adsorption amount than the total pore volume and or specific surface area the relationship between permeability and water vapor adsorption amount was described by the exponential equation k e a b w a c w a 2 where a b and c are fitting parameters the permeability at water vapor adsorption equilibrium was 3 4 orders of magnitude lower than that in the initial stage the decrease in pore size and blockage of pore throats in the process of water vapor adsorption were the reasons for the permeability reduction the permeability of water vapor in shale decreased with increasing pore size blocked by the water film there was a maximum in the distribution of water film thickness with pore size the permeability reduction was closely related to the maximum water film thickness the larger the maximum pore diameter blocked by the water film was the greater the permeability loss for the three shale samples the maximum pore diameters of condensation at 1 3 and 5 mpa were 8 462 nm 4 57 5 285 nm and 3 06 3 656 nm respectively declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests

3358,the construction of dams has tremendously altered the water flow and environmental conditions of natural rivers severely affecting the habitat and reproduction activities of aquatic organisms in this study we constructed a reproduction suitability model for the four major chinese carps fmccs in the upper reaches of the yangtze river and related this to a one dimensional hydrodynamic model of the three gorges reservoir tgr stochastic flood modelling was used to simulate a series of river floods before and after construction of the three gorges dam tgd the simulated floods were used as the input boundaries of the hydrodynamic model to then simulate complex flow conditions in the upper reaches of the yangtze river before and after dam construction so as to simulate the spatial distribution and changes in the spawning grounds of the fmccs we found that the reproduction suitability for the fmccs in the tgr decreased during the post dam period and most of the spawning grounds moved to the river reach above zhongxian the fmccs were found to initially have a total of nine spawning grounds but during the post dam period there were six spawning grounds likely in the 60 km stretch of zhutuo jiangjin section and in the 255 km stretch of banan zhongxian section by setting four different water levels in front of the dam corresponding to no dam low dam middle dam and high dam scenarios we examined the effects of dam sizes on the spatial distribution of the fmccs spawning grounds the results showed that the area of affected spawning grounds positively correlated with the dam s size with high dam scenario corresponding to the construction of the tgd being especially impactful through a net loss of spawning grounds extending 101 km upstream from the dam the results of this study offer scientific guidance for the ecological regulation of the tgr keywords four major chinese carps three gorges reservoir spawning grounds hydrodynamic model 1 introduction dam construction impacts both of river ecology and human society the construction of dams not only alters the original runoff and sediment transport of rivers but also profoundly affects the resident aquatic organisms dams block the migration of fish and other aquatic organisms and affect water regime elements such as river flow velocity water levels and water temperatures during reservoir operation corbacho and sanchez 2001 morita and yamamoto 2002 santos et al 2006 macdougall et al 2007 these alterations in turn affect the spawning and survival of aquatic organisms understanding these impacts may benefit the entire river ecosystem by guiding macro level ecological regulations that attempt to balance the relationship between social development and ecological protection the four major chinese carps fmccs namely black carp mylopharyngodon piceus grass carp ctenopharyngodon idella silver carp hypophthalmichthys molitrix and bighead carp h nobilis are important economic fishes in china and are widely distributed in the yangtze river basin the yangtze river has become an important breeding ground and habitat for the fmccs a survey by yi et al 1988 identified 30 spawning sites used by the fmccs in the main stream of the river prior to construction of the three gorges dam tgd in particular the river sections above yichang spanned 29 6 of the total area and contained 11 spawning sites at chongqing mudong changshou fuling gaojiazhen zhongxian wanzhou yunyang wushan zigui and sandouping yi et al 1988 however aquatic ecosystems are vulnerable to interference from various human activities wang et al 2020 the impoundment of the tgd in 2003 blocked the natural river course preventing fish migration this has hindered fish reproduction triggering a steep decline in the spawning volume of the fmccs as the cross sectional shape of the river channel hydrological processes water temperature regimes and water quality conditions have undergone major changes since the dam was built galat and lipkin 2000 lytle and poff 2004 liu et al 2018 because of these changes the eggs of the fmccs must drift for a longer time to complete hatching and the locations of the spawning grounds have gradually shifted toward the upper reaches of the yangtze river jiang et al 2010 therefore research on the fmccs spawning grounds is urgently needed jiang et al 2010 liu et al 2018 not only will it help to clarify the impact of the dam s construction on the spawning behavior of the fmccs in the upper reaches of the yangtze river but it will also further expand our understanding of the serious ecological threat to the river following construction of the dam numerous researchers have expressed concern about the breeding and habitat conditions of the fmccs in the three gorges reservoir tgr during the post dam period li et al 2008 jiang et al 2010 wang et al 2020 yang et al 2021 li et al 2008 suggested that construction of the tgd would lead to a decline in the number of spawning ground available for the fmccs in the reservoir area however throughout the natural evolution of hydrological and hydrodynamic conditions the fmccs have actively spawned in some river reaches of the reservoir and spawning has increased since 2008 although the proportion of the fmccs broodstock is usually less than 4 of the catch in a given year the proportion of the annual catch by weight exceeds 10 yang et al 2017 this indicates that the reservoir area still provides suitable spawning grounds and habitat for adults of the fmccs previous studies reported that in the post dam period the fmccs more often spawn in the river reach above zhongxian than in the lower reach and that important spawning grounds have been established at the downstream end of the tgr mu et al 2014 wang et al 2015 li et al 2020 mu 2014 numerous studies have explored the impact of the tgd on the spawning activities of the fmccs especially in waters downstream of the dam yu et al 2019 found that large scale cascade reservoirs had changed the frequency distribution of flow sediment and water temperature and these changes affect the spawning of the fmccs below the tgr upstream reservoir releases significantly changed the water temperature of the downstream river which has resulted in a spawning delay of 4 5 weeks for the fmccs spawning wang et al 2020 ban et al 2019 used the range of variation method with selected hydrological indicators to examine the impacts of changes of hydrological variability on spawning by the fmccs downstream of the tgr they found that the high pulse duration rate of increased inflow and rise in the water level are key factors affecting spawning success wang et al 2014b asserted that the tgd changed the thermal state of the discharge water below the dam which has led to delayed spawning by the fmccs liu et al 2018 established a two dimensional hydrodynamic model of the downstream reach to determine the correlation between vorticity in the spawning grounds and the distribution of the fmccs in addition wang et al 2014a used a genetic programming calculation to quantitatively uncover linearly or nonlinearly the impact of various hydrological indicators on the spawning behavior of the fmccs during the pre and post dam periods taking into account the decrease in water temperature when the water flow increases the above mentioned studies focused on the impact of the dam s construction on the spawning activities of the fmccs though some studies comprehensively simulated the indices affecting the fmccs spawning activities as a whole system they used only measured flood simulations or steady state simulations i e constant flood conditions such as 10 000 m3 s 20 000 m3 s and so on few studies have considered the impacts of time variable inflow hydrographs additionally previous studies on changes in spawning ground locations during the pre and post dam periods tended to focus on a single spawning ground and failed to assess changes in the spatial extent of spawning grounds in the tgr there is also a lack of relevant quantitative research on the general distribution of fish spawning sites relative to dams more importantly because the flow conditions are significantly altered in dammed rivers quantitative research is needed on the extent of the impact of dams on river flow conditions for instance traditional steady state flood simulations would hardly reflect the response of the fmccs to changes in flow conditions caused by different inflow hydrographs moreover the simulation of one specific or several measured flood processes usually would not accurately predict the entire spatial distribution of the spawning grounds instead simulation of a large number of stochastic flood events in the reservoir area would effectively increase the number of simulated samples and thereby reliably reflect changes to the spatial distribution of spawning grounds under complex inflows with a large number of simulations it is also possible to further explore the impact of dams on the hydrodynamic processes in the reservoir area which is unattainable with traditional simulations of constant flood flow rates therefore stochastic flood modelling can be indispensable to studying the habitat and reproduction suitability for aquatic organisms in dammed rivers this study addressed these knowledge gaps by investigating the reproductive suitability of the fmccs in different river reaches of the tgd reservoir area a two step method was applied 1 to determine changes in the spatial distribution of the spawning grounds of the fmccs in the upper reaches of the yangtze river specially between zhutuo and the tgd in the pre and post dam periods complex inflow scenarios were simulated based on a model of fmccs reproduction suitability in the tgr 2 to analyze the impact of different dam scenarios on the locations and extent of spawning grounds of the fmccs different dam sizes defined as the water level immediately in front of the dam were further assumed and simulations were carried out 2 study area the tgr is a narrow river type reservoir and in the dry season its backwater area extends from the dam site to chongqing fig 1 however the discharge process of the tgr showed large differences based on the inflow hydrographs of cuntan and zhutuo stations respectively zhang et al 2017 thus zhutuo station was regarded as the upstream boundary to calculate the water discharge incoming runoff reservoir capacity and sediment load of the tgr zhang et al 2017 ren et al 2021 hence this study considered the 756 km stretch between zhutuo and the dam site as the study area fig 1 owing to the complex vertical composition of the water body and the suitable flow conditions this section of the river now constitutes an important aquatic ecosystem in china many small bays once existed on both sides of the river channel in which aquatic plants and plankton inhabited and the bays provided natural shelter as well as nutrients for resident aquatic organisms changes in water flow and water temperature provided suitable habitat and spawning conditions for the fmccs following the construction of the tgd the water level in the reservoir area rose and the original water flow conditions and regional climate changed dramatically the spatial distribution of spawning grounds in the tgr also underwent tremendous changes to assess the impact of the dam on the spatial distribution of the fmccs spawning grounds we allocated 394 cross sections of the tgr into 14 river sections that are potential spawning grounds based on the topography and distribution of spawning grounds in the pre dam period fig 1 table 1 3 methods 3 1 research approach the tgr between zhutuo and the tgd was selected as the study area a hydrodynamic model was established and validated with measured data using mike 11 software developed by dhi a large number of floods based on a stochastic model were generated as the input boundaries of the hydrodynamic model intended to simulate the flood evolution process during the pre and post dam periods the habitat suitability index hsi was used to describe habitat suitability for the fmccs in different sections of the tgr the specific research steps were as follows 1 based on the hsi method the key indices affecting the reproduction activities of the fmccs in the yangtze river were selected and a habitat suitability evaluation system for the fmccs in the upper reaches of the yangtze river was constructed 2 mike 11 software was used to establish a one dimensional hydrodynamic model of the tgr based on the available statistics and stochastic hydrology a periodic stationary autoregressive model of daily flow was constructed to generate a large number of potential flood processes thereafter the progression of a large number of stochastic inflow floods was simulated to obtain changes in the hydrological index combining the simulation results for water temperature we evaluated the reproductive suitability of the fmccs in the reservoir area under complex inflow scenarios to determine the spatial distribution of the spawning grounds 3 based on the flow conditions during the pre and post dam periods the spatial distribution of the spawning grounds of the fmccs in the river reach between zhutuo to the tgd was analyzed and the impact of different dam scenarios on the spawning grounds of the fmccs was further investigated the overall research approach is depicted by the flow chart in fig 2 3 2 reproduction suitability curves for the four major chinese carps the hsi is a classic method for quantitatively describing habitat suitability brown et al 2000 it can be used to characterize the response of organisms to various environmental factors in the surrounding habitat cho et al 2012 knudson et al 2015 the fmccs produce eggs in response to changes in water flow conditions and the environmental factors in specific river sections and these river sections become suitable spawning grounds in this study three important indices that can trigger the spawning behavior of the fmccs i e flow velocity water temperature and water level fluctuation were selected to determine the hsi and a model of fmccs reproduction suitability was constructed to locate the spawning grounds in the tgr 3 2 1 water flow velocity the fmccs are pelagic river spawners with drifting semi buoyant eggs that must remain in suspension in the water column until hatching the newly produced eggs have a water swelling density slightly greater than that of water and require a certain flow rate to hatch yi et al 2010 while drifting down the river the fertilized eggs hatch into juveniles a flow velocity of 0 25 0 9 m s can provide suitable spawning conditions by the fmccs the eggs of these carps begin to sink when the flow velocity is less than 0 27 m s most of the eggs will fall on the riverbed at a velocity of less than 0 25 m s and all eggs will sink at a velocity of less than 0 1 m s cao et al 1987 yi and le 2011 some studies have shown that only a portion of the eggs can hatch out if they settle on the riverbed garcia et al 2015 prada et al 2018 this study assumed that the drifting fluvial eggs would die outside the suitable flow velocity ranges to be determined by the hydrodynamic model in this study 3 2 2 water temperature water temperatures in the tgr from late april to late july each year are suitable for the fmccs to spawn and reproduce during this time the main stream of the yangtze river generally fluctuates between 18 c and 28 c the fmccs in the yangtze river do not breed at temperatures below 18 c since the completion of the tgd the reproduction time of the fmccs has been gradually delayed wang et al 2020 the peak spawning period is at water temperatures of 21 24 c yi et al 1988 which occurs from may to june chen and li 2015 so long as the river water temperatures are above the lower temperature threshold of 18 c wang et al 2008 the fmccs can spawn 3 2 3 water level fluctuation water level fluctuation is an important index influencing the spawning activities of the fmccs provided that the water temperature and flow velocity are suitable the mature broodstock requires an increase in water flow to exhibit spawning behavior yi et al 2010 in most cases the spawning activities of the fmccs are carried out during a period of rising water when the water level drops and the flow rate slows the spawning activities tend to stop the fmccs can be induced to spawn when the water level rises continuously for 4 5 days wang et al 2008 yi et al 2010 and when high water levels are maintained for 2 5 days wang and gao 2017 in summary the spawning activities of the fmccs in the yangtze river are affected by many factors thus it would be impossible to accurately simulate the spawning situation in a certain section of the river by considering only isolated factors a model of fmccs reproduction suitability was established based on the averaged water temperature from 1 may to 10 june at seven stations i e zhutuo tongguanyi cuntan qingxichang wanzhou guandukou and nanjinguan in both the pre and post dam periods because various indices reveal that conditions in this period are suitable for the fmccs to spawn according to the response degree of the fmccs to the changes in different indices the reproduction suitability curves to the changes in water flow velocity water temperature and daily average water level fluctuation were obtained fig 3 the data applied to the reproduction suitability curves were based on expert suggestions and references to the literature ban et al 2009 the formula for calculating hsi was based on the geometric average method yi et al 2010 1 hsi i v i t i dz 1 3 where the value of hsi ranging from 0 to 1 and iv it and idz represent the water flow velocity index water temperature index and water level fluctuation index respectively with values that likewise range between 0 and 1 the determinations of mean velocities and water level fluctuations came from the one dimensional hydrodynamic model described below finally the hsi values of each river cross section along the reservoir area were calculated based on the fmccs reproduction suitability model considering suitability based on different values of hsi jiang et al 2019 table 2 the reservoir locations of cross sections suitable for spawning of the fmccs could then be evaluated owing to discontinuous conditions across each channel cross section the distribution of hsi values at different positions in the channel was relatively scattered this study divided the reservoir area into multiple river sections as listed in table 1 to clearly describe the habitat suitability of the sections for the fmccs we defined a suitability proportion w which represents the proportion of the number of cross sections having hsi values greater than 0 5 among the total number of sections in the study area moreover w could represent the scale of the spawning grounds within a given river section as well as the possibility that a river section would become a spawning ground for the fmccs under stochastic flood conditions a higher w value indicates proportionately greater suitability for the fmccs meaning the more likely the river section is to become a spawning ground the formula is 2 w n n 100 where n represents the number of cross sections with hsi greater than 0 5 in a given river section n represents the total number of cross sections in this river section and w represents the proportion of suitable area that is the overall suitability in a certain river section of the fmccs the range of the values of w is 0 1 3 3 hydrodynamic model of the three gorges reservoir 3 3 1 stochastic inflow floods the spatial distribution of the fmccs spawning grounds under one or several actual flood simulations is often subject to uncertainty because of various influencing factors each year stochastic flood simulation can generate a large number of flood sequences and predict future water regimes based on statistical and actual hydrological data gharari and razavi 2018 our study established a stochastic flood model to simulate changes in water flow conditions under complex inflows to evaluate changes in the spatial distributions of the fmccs spawning grounds in this study we established a periodic stationary autoregressive model of daily flow in the tgr to realize the stochastic simulation of the flood process at three main inflow stations zhutuo beibei and wulong referenced from jing et al 2020 this model divided a year into several periods based on the consistency of changes in the autocorrelation structure of the daily flow and it established a corresponding stationary autoregressive model for each period the model used the measured daily flow data of the main inflow stations from 1957 to 2016 60 years with 28 days in february each year as the modeling data according to the statistical characteristics of the daily flow data and the differences in autocorrelation coefficients in different periods combined with the principle of staging the annual daily flow process was specifically divided into r periods the periodic stationary autoregressive model of daily flow was expressed according to the formula 3 z t i 1 p 1 φ i 1 z t i ε t 1 1 t t 1 i 1 p 2 φ i 2 z t i ε t 2 t 1 t t 2 i 1 p r φ i r z t i ε t r t r 1 t 365 where z t is the flow simulation sequence of day t which is standardized and normalized t d d 1 2 r 1 is the start day of the different periods and r is the number of periods φ 1 j φ 2 j φ p j j is the autoregressive coefficient of the period j p j is the level of the period j 1 2 r and ε t j is the normal independent stochastic variable mean value is 0 square error is σ ε j 2 the autoregressive coefficients were estimated using the yule walker equations as follows 4 φ 1 j φ 2 j φ p j j 1 ρ 1 j ρ 2 j ρ p j 1 j ρ 1 j 1 ρ 1 j ρ p j 2 j ρ p j 1 j ρ p j 2 j ρ p j 3 j 1 ρ 1 j ρ 2 j ρ p j j where ρ 1 j ρ 2 j ρ p j j is an average value of the autocorrelation coefficients γ i j of level 1 2 pj in different periods the residual variance σ ε j 2 was calculated using the formula 5 σ ε j 2 1 φ 1 j ρ 1 j φ 2 j ρ 2 j φ p j j ρ p j j according to the generated stochastic flood process of the main inflow stations 2000 inflow scenarios at the zhutuo wulong and beibei hydrological stations were formed 3 3 2 simulation of three indices mike 11 was used to build a one dimensional hydrodynamic model to simulate the evolution of different flood processes this model was based on the saint venant equations and solved using the abbott ionescu format the governing equations are as follows more model details can be found in yan et al 2021 the continuity equation is 6 b z t q x q and the momentum equation is 7 q t x q 2 a g a z x q q k 2 0 where x is the distance along the river in meters m t is time in second s z m and q m3 s are the water level and flow through a river section at any time a m2 is the cross section area q m2 s is the lateral inflow per unit length b m is the water width of the river section g m s2 is gravitational acceleration and k m3 s is the flow modulus to reflect as much as possible the influence of the different forms of all stochastic flood processes and the statistical laws on the simulation results we selected 2000 flood processes as the inflow conditions of the one dimensional hydrodynamic model this sample size of 2000 is representative of the water flow patterns of most possible flood processes and can generate the flood evolution under complex inflow conditions the one dimensional hydrodynamic model simulated the changes in water level and water velocity throughout the study reach in various periods which provided relevant data support for the evaluation of fmccs reproduction suitability the channel shapes were generalized from the 414 measured cross section data in 2012 provided by changjiang water resources commission of the ministry of water resources china and the initial water surface elevation was calculated by the hydrodynamic model under different inflow conditions thereafter the one dimensional hydrodynamic model was used to simulate each flood using the pre and post dam conditions during the pre dam period the water level water discharge relationship curve of yichang station was fit under natural flow conditions based on the measured data from 1990 to 2003 to be used as the outflow boundary condition for the model during the post dam period the model calculation used the water level change regime of the tgr from 1 may to 10 june as the downstream boundary condition li et al 2018 that is the starting water level was 155 m dropping to 145 m daily average water temperatures in the pre and post dam periods were calculated based on the daily measured data at seven stations in the zhutuo tgd section the formula is as follows 8 t i j 1 n t j i n where t i i 1 2 3 n is the water temperature on the i th day in the simulated water temperature t j i j 1 2 3 n i 1 2 3 n is the water temperature value of the i th day in the j th year in the actual measured water temperature thereafter this study took the daily water temperature calculation results from 1 may to 10 june as the daily water temperature state under stochastic flood conditions the water temperature data came from the actual daily average water temperature data of seven hydrological stations for the pre dam period 1994 2002 and post dam period 2003 2017 finally the flow velocity and water level fluctuation of each flood process were calculated and combined with the changes of water temperature to form the basic calculation data of the fmccs reproduction suitability model 3 4 reproduction suitability model of the four major chinese carps in the three gorges reservoir 3 4 1 model validation the one dimensional hydrodynamic model established by mike 11 was verified by fitting the measured and simulated water level data this study used measured flood processes in july 2010 and july 2012 to calibrate and verify the roughness of the hydrodynamic model respectively based on the measured water level regime at 17 hydrological stations along the reservoir area the simulated water levels of the model fit well with the measurements and the water level error ranges of different stations were 0 03 0 64 m during the calibration period and 0 02 0 38 m during the verification period yan et al 2021 the simulation sequence generated by the periodic stationary autoregressive model of daily flow was evaluated by the moment method the statistical parameters included the dispersion coefficient cv coefficient of skewness cs mean x root mean square deviation s and level 1 autocorrelation coefficient γ 1 when the statistical parameters of each day meet a certain pass rate it can be considered that the model calculation is accurate and meet the research needs jing et al 2020 the overall pass rate of cs is n 365 100 where n is the number of qualified days in a year the accuracy of spawning ground positioning also needed to be verified based on the measured flood process i e 2011 2012 2014 this research simulated the spatial distribution of spawning grounds in the reservoir area in the corresponding years according to the suitability proportion w of each section along the river this was then compared with the measured spatial location of the spawning ground to prove the accuracy of the fmccs reproduction suitability model 3 4 2 modelling scheme the spatial distribution of the spawning grounds of the fmccs under the condition of 2000 stochastic inflow flood events was then simulated and analyzed based on the verified hydrodynamic model and reproduction suitability model this analysis was mainly carried out in two parts first based on the two conditions during the pre and post dam periods the distribution and changes of the spawning grounds of the fmccs in the zhutuo tgd river section under different current conditions were analyzed then to clarify the impact of different dam scenarios on the spawning behavior of the fmccs this study further assumed and calculated the suitability of the fmccs in the tgr under two of the scenarios the low dam and middle dam scenarios in this study the no dam and high dam scenarios demote the flow condition of the pre and post dam periods respectively the tgr is currently in a period of normal operation which corresponds to the high dam scenario in the simulation process and the water level in front of the dam is maintained at 155 m on 1 may of each year the flow discharge from the tgr is increased in preparation for flood control thus the water level in front of the dam drops continuously from a starting level of 155 m to 145 m on 10 june the middle dam scenario corresponds to the initial operation period of the tgr the scheduling mode in this scenario is the same as in the normal operation period but the water level is lower in the dry season the water level in front of the dam gradually drops from 140 m to 135 m in this hypothetical low dam scenario in this study the water level in front of the dam follows the same scheduling mode dropping from 115 m to 105 m thus the four dam scenarios no dam low dam middle dam and high dam were expressed as the different water levels in front of the tgd table 3 4 results 4 1 calibration and verification of the stochastic flood model in this study the passing rate of each key parameter of the stochastic simulation sequence was tested among these parameters the relative error between the simulated and measured values of the coefficient of skewness cs was less than 15 which is qualified the pass standard for the remaining statistical parameters is no more than 10 table 4 shows the passing rate of the statistical parameters of the main inflow stations in the tgr according to the parameter passing rate of each station the simulated value of the parameter fits well with the measured value the simulation sequence generated by the periodic stationary autoregressive model of daily flow adequately reflects the hydrological characteristics of the measured sequence 4 2 simulation accuracy of the four major chinese carps reproduction suitability model based on the measured floods during the normal operation of the tgr in the post dam period i e in 2011 2012 and 2014 the spatial distribution of the spawning grounds under the measured flood situations was analyzed the results are presented in table 5 against the three measured floods in 2011 2012 and 2014 the simulated distribution of the spawning grounds was consistent with the situation reflected in the actual annual survey of the tgr in 2011 the simulated suitable spawning area for the fmccs in banan xiakouzhen section accounted for 42 3 of the river section the measured data from mu et al 2014 confirmed that this river section was the main spawning ground for the fmccs in 2011 consistent with the results of this study table 5 in 2012 the banan xiakouzhen section was again the main spawning ground for the fmccs at 65 4 of the river section consistent with the location of the spawning grounds identified in field investigations by mu 2014 in 2014 the suitability proportion w of the zhutuo jiangjin jiangjin banan and fuling puzituo river sections aligned with the measured data given in wang et al 2015 thereby indicating that the spawning grounds were correctly determined by our model therefore the model of fmccs reproduction suitability established here can be used to accurately locate the spawning grounds of these fishes in the upper reaches of the yangtze river 4 3 distribution of spawning grounds of the four major chinese carps during the pre and post dam periods 4 3 1 location of the four major chinese carps spawning grounds under stochastic flood conditions this study examined the reproduction suitability of the fmccs under pre and post dam scenarios the suitability proportion w of different river sections under 2000 stochastic flood events was counted to determine the location of the fmccs spawning grounds table 6 a comparison of the suitability proportions in the pre and post dam periods is shown in fig 4 the calculations indicated that construction of the tgd has greatly impacted the spawning activities of the fmccs the scale and locations of the spawning grounds underwent tremendous change in table 6 δ w is the change in w after dam construction relative to before dam construction simulation of the pre dam scenarios table 6 shows that the zhutuo tgd river section under natural flow conditions is suitable for spawning by the fmccs with average values of w ranging from 9 3 to 58 5 the w values for all river sections except for puzituo zhongxian and yunyang guling at 10 indicate that the spawning grounds of the fmccs in the pre dam period are densely distributed in the upper reaches of the yangtze river which is consistent with historical survey results and measured data yi et al 1988 based on the simulated results the evaluation accuracy of the fmccs reproduction suitability model has been further confirmed in the pre dam period the fmccs exhibit some spawning activities in the river between zhutuo and the tgd however since the completion of the tgd the impact on the water body in the reservoir area has become prominent the reach downstream from zhongxian is significantly affected and the flow conditions in front of the dam are not suitable for the fmccs to reproduce the spawning activities of the fmccs show an upstream shift and some spawning grounds gradually disappear in the post dam period the reach above zhongxian contains nine spawning grounds for the fmccs in the reservoir area between zhutuo and yunyang especially the fmccs have a higher reproduction suitability proportion in the zhutuo jiangjin section with a length of 60 km and in the banan zhongxian section with a length of 255 km table 6 4 3 2 impact of dam size on the four major chinese carps spawning grounds to clarify the impact of dam size on the spawning behavior of the fmccs this study further assumed and calculated the suitability of the fmccs in the tgr under two of the dam scenarios the low dam and middle dam scenarios table 7 the dam size is related to the water level in front of it as described in section 3 4 2 and table 3 therefore a simulation of the dam s size can be obtained by controlling the water level at the front of the dam according to the different dispatching water levels in front of the dam the pre dam situation corresponds to the no dam scenario and post dam to the high dam scenarios table 6 the calculation results of the four dam scenarios are shown in fig 5 and the changes of w between the three dam conditions and the no dam conditions are listed in table 8 5 discussion based on the simulation results shown in table 6 the spawning suitability of fmccs in the river reaches upstream and downstream of zhongxian changes with the construction of the tgd at the head of the tgr the zhutuo jiangjin and banan zhongxian river sections show relatively high suitability when compared with that in the pre dam period a possible explanation is that the high water depth in front of the dam usually changes slowly owning to the influence of backwater which directly reduces the spawning suitability of the fmccs in the lower reach of the tgr yang et al 2021 therefore the fmccs have to leave the original river reach to find a more suitable spawning ground in the backwater zone where the water depth velocity water temperature and water level fluctuation meet the species spawning requirements yang et al 2021 yi et al 2010 the luoqi fuling river section can provide 50 4 of suitable spawning area for the fmccs whereas the puzituo zhongxian river section near the middle reaches of the reservoir area can provide 18 9 the reach above zhongxian has gradually become a spawning ground for the fmccs although there are cases of proportionally high suitability under certain water flow conditions in the area in front of the dam e g the wushan badong and badong tgd river sections can provide 13 6 and 13 9 suitable area during some unusual flood periods respectively this area showed a small probability of forming a spawning ground for the fmccs only during the simulation of multiple floods therefore compared with natural water flows the impact of dam construction on the spawning grounds of the fmccs is significant through comparisons of the suitability proportion w under the four dam scenarios the w value of each spawning ground in the river section above zhongxian hardly differs among scenarios in the post dam period regardless of the size of the dam table 8 the low dam middle dam and high dam scenarios correspond to three operational periods of the tgd i e dam water levels of 135 m 156 m and 175 m respectively which all result in a fluctuating backwater zone of the tgr in the reach above zhongxian gao et al 2010 yang et al 2021 this situation may explain the relatively uniform high suitability proportions in the reach above zhongxian under the three dam scenarios in the post dam period there the luoqi fuling river section is the most suitable spawning ground for the fmccs however significant differences in w exist in the sections downstream of zhongxian under the different dam scenarios the main reason for this difference could be an increase in the backwater distance caused by the dam construction which leads to a decrease of velocity and less water level fluctuation in front of the dam fmccs cannot get enough flow and velocity stimulation to spawn so they have to move away from their original spawning grounds and migrate upstream under the scenario of building a low dam in the upper reaches of the yangtze river the variation trend in values of w along the way is consistent with the calculated results of the no dam scenario but generally lower than that of the water level without the dam the sections downstream of wanzhou will be most affected by the blockage of the dam at a scale of 64 km under the scenario of building the middle and high dams the river section below zhongxian is severely affected by the backwater accordingly the w values are low and suitable spawning grounds gradually disappear from these reaches under the middle dam and high dam scenarios 90 km and 101 km of spawning grounds disappear respectively thus construction of the dam not only directly prevents the downstream fmccs from returning to spawn but also causes a decrease in water velocity in front of the dam the larger size of the dam the larger influence on the water body in front of the dam and the slower water level fluctuation these impacts directly result in a longer backwater distance and a greater loss of spawning grounds with a larger dam consequently the fmccs gradually migrate upstream after losing suitable spawning conditions the proportion of suitable spawning ground in the river reach between luoqi and zhongxian increases under the three dam sizes and that in the reach between zhutuo and luoqi loses 57 km 54 km and 59 km of spawning habitat under the small middle and large dam scenarios respectively accounting for 90 60 and 59 of the total spawning grounds loss even though spawning grounds are lost after dam construction they are mainly distributed in the river reach above zhongxian and especially in the zhutuo jiangjin and banan zhongxian river sections 6 conclusions by coupling a hydrodynamic model and a model of fmccs reproduction suitability we simulated and analyzed the spatial distribution of spawning grounds of the fmcc as well as changes in the extent of suitable spawning ground in each river section in the pre dam and post dam periods in the upper reaches of the yangtze river under complex inflow conditions the main conclusions are 1 through the simulation and analysis of the spatial distribution of the spawning grounds of the fmccs under the stochastic flood process we determined that locations of suitable spawning grounds shift upstream compared with natural river conditions in the post dam period the fmccs have a higher reproduction suitability proportion in the zhutuo jiangjin length 60 km and banan zhongxian river sections length 255 km the reproduction suitability simulations results imply nine suitable spawning grounds for the fmccs in the upper reaches of the yangtze river between zhutuo and yuyang 2 through the simulation of four dam scenarios in the tgr in comparison with pre dam river conditions construction of the dam leads to fmccs spawning ground losses of 64 km under the low dam scenario 90 km under the middle dam scenario and 101 km under the high dam scenario the spawning ground lost in the reach between zhutuo and luoqi accounts for 90 60 and 59 of the total net loss respectively under the three dam sizes these results show that the ecological suitability of a dammed river for aquatic organisms is affected to varying degrees depending on the size of the dam credit

3358,the construction of dams has tremendously altered the water flow and environmental conditions of natural rivers severely affecting the habitat and reproduction activities of aquatic organisms in this study we constructed a reproduction suitability model for the four major chinese carps fmccs in the upper reaches of the yangtze river and related this to a one dimensional hydrodynamic model of the three gorges reservoir tgr stochastic flood modelling was used to simulate a series of river floods before and after construction of the three gorges dam tgd the simulated floods were used as the input boundaries of the hydrodynamic model to then simulate complex flow conditions in the upper reaches of the yangtze river before and after dam construction so as to simulate the spatial distribution and changes in the spawning grounds of the fmccs we found that the reproduction suitability for the fmccs in the tgr decreased during the post dam period and most of the spawning grounds moved to the river reach above zhongxian the fmccs were found to initially have a total of nine spawning grounds but during the post dam period there were six spawning grounds likely in the 60 km stretch of zhutuo jiangjin section and in the 255 km stretch of banan zhongxian section by setting four different water levels in front of the dam corresponding to no dam low dam middle dam and high dam scenarios we examined the effects of dam sizes on the spatial distribution of the fmccs spawning grounds the results showed that the area of affected spawning grounds positively correlated with the dam s size with high dam scenario corresponding to the construction of the tgd being especially impactful through a net loss of spawning grounds extending 101 km upstream from the dam the results of this study offer scientific guidance for the ecological regulation of the tgr keywords four major chinese carps three gorges reservoir spawning grounds hydrodynamic model 1 introduction dam construction impacts both of river ecology and human society the construction of dams not only alters the original runoff and sediment transport of rivers but also profoundly affects the resident aquatic organisms dams block the migration of fish and other aquatic organisms and affect water regime elements such as river flow velocity water levels and water temperatures during reservoir operation corbacho and sanchez 2001 morita and yamamoto 2002 santos et al 2006 macdougall et al 2007 these alterations in turn affect the spawning and survival of aquatic organisms understanding these impacts may benefit the entire river ecosystem by guiding macro level ecological regulations that attempt to balance the relationship between social development and ecological protection the four major chinese carps fmccs namely black carp mylopharyngodon piceus grass carp ctenopharyngodon idella silver carp hypophthalmichthys molitrix and bighead carp h nobilis are important economic fishes in china and are widely distributed in the yangtze river basin the yangtze river has become an important breeding ground and habitat for the fmccs a survey by yi et al 1988 identified 30 spawning sites used by the fmccs in the main stream of the river prior to construction of the three gorges dam tgd in particular the river sections above yichang spanned 29 6 of the total area and contained 11 spawning sites at chongqing mudong changshou fuling gaojiazhen zhongxian wanzhou yunyang wushan zigui and sandouping yi et al 1988 however aquatic ecosystems are vulnerable to interference from various human activities wang et al 2020 the impoundment of the tgd in 2003 blocked the natural river course preventing fish migration this has hindered fish reproduction triggering a steep decline in the spawning volume of the fmccs as the cross sectional shape of the river channel hydrological processes water temperature regimes and water quality conditions have undergone major changes since the dam was built galat and lipkin 2000 lytle and poff 2004 liu et al 2018 because of these changes the eggs of the fmccs must drift for a longer time to complete hatching and the locations of the spawning grounds have gradually shifted toward the upper reaches of the yangtze river jiang et al 2010 therefore research on the fmccs spawning grounds is urgently needed jiang et al 2010 liu et al 2018 not only will it help to clarify the impact of the dam s construction on the spawning behavior of the fmccs in the upper reaches of the yangtze river but it will also further expand our understanding of the serious ecological threat to the river following construction of the dam numerous researchers have expressed concern about the breeding and habitat conditions of the fmccs in the three gorges reservoir tgr during the post dam period li et al 2008 jiang et al 2010 wang et al 2020 yang et al 2021 li et al 2008 suggested that construction of the tgd would lead to a decline in the number of spawning ground available for the fmccs in the reservoir area however throughout the natural evolution of hydrological and hydrodynamic conditions the fmccs have actively spawned in some river reaches of the reservoir and spawning has increased since 2008 although the proportion of the fmccs broodstock is usually less than 4 of the catch in a given year the proportion of the annual catch by weight exceeds 10 yang et al 2017 this indicates that the reservoir area still provides suitable spawning grounds and habitat for adults of the fmccs previous studies reported that in the post dam period the fmccs more often spawn in the river reach above zhongxian than in the lower reach and that important spawning grounds have been established at the downstream end of the tgr mu et al 2014 wang et al 2015 li et al 2020 mu 2014 numerous studies have explored the impact of the tgd on the spawning activities of the fmccs especially in waters downstream of the dam yu et al 2019 found that large scale cascade reservoirs had changed the frequency distribution of flow sediment and water temperature and these changes affect the spawning of the fmccs below the tgr upstream reservoir releases significantly changed the water temperature of the downstream river which has resulted in a spawning delay of 4 5 weeks for the fmccs spawning wang et al 2020 ban et al 2019 used the range of variation method with selected hydrological indicators to examine the impacts of changes of hydrological variability on spawning by the fmccs downstream of the tgr they found that the high pulse duration rate of increased inflow and rise in the water level are key factors affecting spawning success wang et al 2014b asserted that the tgd changed the thermal state of the discharge water below the dam which has led to delayed spawning by the fmccs liu et al 2018 established a two dimensional hydrodynamic model of the downstream reach to determine the correlation between vorticity in the spawning grounds and the distribution of the fmccs in addition wang et al 2014a used a genetic programming calculation to quantitatively uncover linearly or nonlinearly the impact of various hydrological indicators on the spawning behavior of the fmccs during the pre and post dam periods taking into account the decrease in water temperature when the water flow increases the above mentioned studies focused on the impact of the dam s construction on the spawning activities of the fmccs though some studies comprehensively simulated the indices affecting the fmccs spawning activities as a whole system they used only measured flood simulations or steady state simulations i e constant flood conditions such as 10 000 m3 s 20 000 m3 s and so on few studies have considered the impacts of time variable inflow hydrographs additionally previous studies on changes in spawning ground locations during the pre and post dam periods tended to focus on a single spawning ground and failed to assess changes in the spatial extent of spawning grounds in the tgr there is also a lack of relevant quantitative research on the general distribution of fish spawning sites relative to dams more importantly because the flow conditions are significantly altered in dammed rivers quantitative research is needed on the extent of the impact of dams on river flow conditions for instance traditional steady state flood simulations would hardly reflect the response of the fmccs to changes in flow conditions caused by different inflow hydrographs moreover the simulation of one specific or several measured flood processes usually would not accurately predict the entire spatial distribution of the spawning grounds instead simulation of a large number of stochastic flood events in the reservoir area would effectively increase the number of simulated samples and thereby reliably reflect changes to the spatial distribution of spawning grounds under complex inflows with a large number of simulations it is also possible to further explore the impact of dams on the hydrodynamic processes in the reservoir area which is unattainable with traditional simulations of constant flood flow rates therefore stochastic flood modelling can be indispensable to studying the habitat and reproduction suitability for aquatic organisms in dammed rivers this study addressed these knowledge gaps by investigating the reproductive suitability of the fmccs in different river reaches of the tgd reservoir area a two step method was applied 1 to determine changes in the spatial distribution of the spawning grounds of the fmccs in the upper reaches of the yangtze river specially between zhutuo and the tgd in the pre and post dam periods complex inflow scenarios were simulated based on a model of fmccs reproduction suitability in the tgr 2 to analyze the impact of different dam scenarios on the locations and extent of spawning grounds of the fmccs different dam sizes defined as the water level immediately in front of the dam were further assumed and simulations were carried out 2 study area the tgr is a narrow river type reservoir and in the dry season its backwater area extends from the dam site to chongqing fig 1 however the discharge process of the tgr showed large differences based on the inflow hydrographs of cuntan and zhutuo stations respectively zhang et al 2017 thus zhutuo station was regarded as the upstream boundary to calculate the water discharge incoming runoff reservoir capacity and sediment load of the tgr zhang et al 2017 ren et al 2021 hence this study considered the 756 km stretch between zhutuo and the dam site as the study area fig 1 owing to the complex vertical composition of the water body and the suitable flow conditions this section of the river now constitutes an important aquatic ecosystem in china many small bays once existed on both sides of the river channel in which aquatic plants and plankton inhabited and the bays provided natural shelter as well as nutrients for resident aquatic organisms changes in water flow and water temperature provided suitable habitat and spawning conditions for the fmccs following the construction of the tgd the water level in the reservoir area rose and the original water flow conditions and regional climate changed dramatically the spatial distribution of spawning grounds in the tgr also underwent tremendous changes to assess the impact of the dam on the spatial distribution of the fmccs spawning grounds we allocated 394 cross sections of the tgr into 14 river sections that are potential spawning grounds based on the topography and distribution of spawning grounds in the pre dam period fig 1 table 1 3 methods 3 1 research approach the tgr between zhutuo and the tgd was selected as the study area a hydrodynamic model was established and validated with measured data using mike 11 software developed by dhi a large number of floods based on a stochastic model were generated as the input boundaries of the hydrodynamic model intended to simulate the flood evolution process during the pre and post dam periods the habitat suitability index hsi was used to describe habitat suitability for the fmccs in different sections of the tgr the specific research steps were as follows 1 based on the hsi method the key indices affecting the reproduction activities of the fmccs in the yangtze river were selected and a habitat suitability evaluation system for the fmccs in the upper reaches of the yangtze river was constructed 2 mike 11 software was used to establish a one dimensional hydrodynamic model of the tgr based on the available statistics and stochastic hydrology a periodic stationary autoregressive model of daily flow was constructed to generate a large number of potential flood processes thereafter the progression of a large number of stochastic inflow floods was simulated to obtain changes in the hydrological index combining the simulation results for water temperature we evaluated the reproductive suitability of the fmccs in the reservoir area under complex inflow scenarios to determine the spatial distribution of the spawning grounds 3 based on the flow conditions during the pre and post dam periods the spatial distribution of the spawning grounds of the fmccs in the river reach between zhutuo to the tgd was analyzed and the impact of different dam scenarios on the spawning grounds of the fmccs was further investigated the overall research approach is depicted by the flow chart in fig 2 3 2 reproduction suitability curves for the four major chinese carps the hsi is a classic method for quantitatively describing habitat suitability brown et al 2000 it can be used to characterize the response of organisms to various environmental factors in the surrounding habitat cho et al 2012 knudson et al 2015 the fmccs produce eggs in response to changes in water flow conditions and the environmental factors in specific river sections and these river sections become suitable spawning grounds in this study three important indices that can trigger the spawning behavior of the fmccs i e flow velocity water temperature and water level fluctuation were selected to determine the hsi and a model of fmccs reproduction suitability was constructed to locate the spawning grounds in the tgr 3 2 1 water flow velocity the fmccs are pelagic river spawners with drifting semi buoyant eggs that must remain in suspension in the water column until hatching the newly produced eggs have a water swelling density slightly greater than that of water and require a certain flow rate to hatch yi et al 2010 while drifting down the river the fertilized eggs hatch into juveniles a flow velocity of 0 25 0 9 m s can provide suitable spawning conditions by the fmccs the eggs of these carps begin to sink when the flow velocity is less than 0 27 m s most of the eggs will fall on the riverbed at a velocity of less than 0 25 m s and all eggs will sink at a velocity of less than 0 1 m s cao et al 1987 yi and le 2011 some studies have shown that only a portion of the eggs can hatch out if they settle on the riverbed garcia et al 2015 prada et al 2018 this study assumed that the drifting fluvial eggs would die outside the suitable flow velocity ranges to be determined by the hydrodynamic model in this study 3 2 2 water temperature water temperatures in the tgr from late april to late july each year are suitable for the fmccs to spawn and reproduce during this time the main stream of the yangtze river generally fluctuates between 18 c and 28 c the fmccs in the yangtze river do not breed at temperatures below 18 c since the completion of the tgd the reproduction time of the fmccs has been gradually delayed wang et al 2020 the peak spawning period is at water temperatures of 21 24 c yi et al 1988 which occurs from may to june chen and li 2015 so long as the river water temperatures are above the lower temperature threshold of 18 c wang et al 2008 the fmccs can spawn 3 2 3 water level fluctuation water level fluctuation is an important index influencing the spawning activities of the fmccs provided that the water temperature and flow velocity are suitable the mature broodstock requires an increase in water flow to exhibit spawning behavior yi et al 2010 in most cases the spawning activities of the fmccs are carried out during a period of rising water when the water level drops and the flow rate slows the spawning activities tend to stop the fmccs can be induced to spawn when the water level rises continuously for 4 5 days wang et al 2008 yi et al 2010 and when high water levels are maintained for 2 5 days wang and gao 2017 in summary the spawning activities of the fmccs in the yangtze river are affected by many factors thus it would be impossible to accurately simulate the spawning situation in a certain section of the river by considering only isolated factors a model of fmccs reproduction suitability was established based on the averaged water temperature from 1 may to 10 june at seven stations i e zhutuo tongguanyi cuntan qingxichang wanzhou guandukou and nanjinguan in both the pre and post dam periods because various indices reveal that conditions in this period are suitable for the fmccs to spawn according to the response degree of the fmccs to the changes in different indices the reproduction suitability curves to the changes in water flow velocity water temperature and daily average water level fluctuation were obtained fig 3 the data applied to the reproduction suitability curves were based on expert suggestions and references to the literature ban et al 2009 the formula for calculating hsi was based on the geometric average method yi et al 2010 1 hsi i v i t i dz 1 3 where the value of hsi ranging from 0 to 1 and iv it and idz represent the water flow velocity index water temperature index and water level fluctuation index respectively with values that likewise range between 0 and 1 the determinations of mean velocities and water level fluctuations came from the one dimensional hydrodynamic model described below finally the hsi values of each river cross section along the reservoir area were calculated based on the fmccs reproduction suitability model considering suitability based on different values of hsi jiang et al 2019 table 2 the reservoir locations of cross sections suitable for spawning of the fmccs could then be evaluated owing to discontinuous conditions across each channel cross section the distribution of hsi values at different positions in the channel was relatively scattered this study divided the reservoir area into multiple river sections as listed in table 1 to clearly describe the habitat suitability of the sections for the fmccs we defined a suitability proportion w which represents the proportion of the number of cross sections having hsi values greater than 0 5 among the total number of sections in the study area moreover w could represent the scale of the spawning grounds within a given river section as well as the possibility that a river section would become a spawning ground for the fmccs under stochastic flood conditions a higher w value indicates proportionately greater suitability for the fmccs meaning the more likely the river section is to become a spawning ground the formula is 2 w n n 100 where n represents the number of cross sections with hsi greater than 0 5 in a given river section n represents the total number of cross sections in this river section and w represents the proportion of suitable area that is the overall suitability in a certain river section of the fmccs the range of the values of w is 0 1 3 3 hydrodynamic model of the three gorges reservoir 3 3 1 stochastic inflow floods the spatial distribution of the fmccs spawning grounds under one or several actual flood simulations is often subject to uncertainty because of various influencing factors each year stochastic flood simulation can generate a large number of flood sequences and predict future water regimes based on statistical and actual hydrological data gharari and razavi 2018 our study established a stochastic flood model to simulate changes in water flow conditions under complex inflows to evaluate changes in the spatial distributions of the fmccs spawning grounds in this study we established a periodic stationary autoregressive model of daily flow in the tgr to realize the stochastic simulation of the flood process at three main inflow stations zhutuo beibei and wulong referenced from jing et al 2020 this model divided a year into several periods based on the consistency of changes in the autocorrelation structure of the daily flow and it established a corresponding stationary autoregressive model for each period the model used the measured daily flow data of the main inflow stations from 1957 to 2016 60 years with 28 days in february each year as the modeling data according to the statistical characteristics of the daily flow data and the differences in autocorrelation coefficients in different periods combined with the principle of staging the annual daily flow process was specifically divided into r periods the periodic stationary autoregressive model of daily flow was expressed according to the formula 3 z t i 1 p 1 φ i 1 z t i ε t 1 1 t t 1 i 1 p 2 φ i 2 z t i ε t 2 t 1 t t 2 i 1 p r φ i r z t i ε t r t r 1 t 365 where z t is the flow simulation sequence of day t which is standardized and normalized t d d 1 2 r 1 is the start day of the different periods and r is the number of periods φ 1 j φ 2 j φ p j j is the autoregressive coefficient of the period j p j is the level of the period j 1 2 r and ε t j is the normal independent stochastic variable mean value is 0 square error is σ ε j 2 the autoregressive coefficients were estimated using the yule walker equations as follows 4 φ 1 j φ 2 j φ p j j 1 ρ 1 j ρ 2 j ρ p j 1 j ρ 1 j 1 ρ 1 j ρ p j 2 j ρ p j 1 j ρ p j 2 j ρ p j 3 j 1 ρ 1 j ρ 2 j ρ p j j where ρ 1 j ρ 2 j ρ p j j is an average value of the autocorrelation coefficients γ i j of level 1 2 pj in different periods the residual variance σ ε j 2 was calculated using the formula 5 σ ε j 2 1 φ 1 j ρ 1 j φ 2 j ρ 2 j φ p j j ρ p j j according to the generated stochastic flood process of the main inflow stations 2000 inflow scenarios at the zhutuo wulong and beibei hydrological stations were formed 3 3 2 simulation of three indices mike 11 was used to build a one dimensional hydrodynamic model to simulate the evolution of different flood processes this model was based on the saint venant equations and solved using the abbott ionescu format the governing equations are as follows more model details can be found in yan et al 2021 the continuity equation is 6 b z t q x q and the momentum equation is 7 q t x q 2 a g a z x q q k 2 0 where x is the distance along the river in meters m t is time in second s z m and q m3 s are the water level and flow through a river section at any time a m2 is the cross section area q m2 s is the lateral inflow per unit length b m is the water width of the river section g m s2 is gravitational acceleration and k m3 s is the flow modulus to reflect as much as possible the influence of the different forms of all stochastic flood processes and the statistical laws on the simulation results we selected 2000 flood processes as the inflow conditions of the one dimensional hydrodynamic model this sample size of 2000 is representative of the water flow patterns of most possible flood processes and can generate the flood evolution under complex inflow conditions the one dimensional hydrodynamic model simulated the changes in water level and water velocity throughout the study reach in various periods which provided relevant data support for the evaluation of fmccs reproduction suitability the channel shapes were generalized from the 414 measured cross section data in 2012 provided by changjiang water resources commission of the ministry of water resources china and the initial water surface elevation was calculated by the hydrodynamic model under different inflow conditions thereafter the one dimensional hydrodynamic model was used to simulate each flood using the pre and post dam conditions during the pre dam period the water level water discharge relationship curve of yichang station was fit under natural flow conditions based on the measured data from 1990 to 2003 to be used as the outflow boundary condition for the model during the post dam period the model calculation used the water level change regime of the tgr from 1 may to 10 june as the downstream boundary condition li et al 2018 that is the starting water level was 155 m dropping to 145 m daily average water temperatures in the pre and post dam periods were calculated based on the daily measured data at seven stations in the zhutuo tgd section the formula is as follows 8 t i j 1 n t j i n where t i i 1 2 3 n is the water temperature on the i th day in the simulated water temperature t j i j 1 2 3 n i 1 2 3 n is the water temperature value of the i th day in the j th year in the actual measured water temperature thereafter this study took the daily water temperature calculation results from 1 may to 10 june as the daily water temperature state under stochastic flood conditions the water temperature data came from the actual daily average water temperature data of seven hydrological stations for the pre dam period 1994 2002 and post dam period 2003 2017 finally the flow velocity and water level fluctuation of each flood process were calculated and combined with the changes of water temperature to form the basic calculation data of the fmccs reproduction suitability model 3 4 reproduction suitability model of the four major chinese carps in the three gorges reservoir 3 4 1 model validation the one dimensional hydrodynamic model established by mike 11 was verified by fitting the measured and simulated water level data this study used measured flood processes in july 2010 and july 2012 to calibrate and verify the roughness of the hydrodynamic model respectively based on the measured water level regime at 17 hydrological stations along the reservoir area the simulated water levels of the model fit well with the measurements and the water level error ranges of different stations were 0 03 0 64 m during the calibration period and 0 02 0 38 m during the verification period yan et al 2021 the simulation sequence generated by the periodic stationary autoregressive model of daily flow was evaluated by the moment method the statistical parameters included the dispersion coefficient cv coefficient of skewness cs mean x root mean square deviation s and level 1 autocorrelation coefficient γ 1 when the statistical parameters of each day meet a certain pass rate it can be considered that the model calculation is accurate and meet the research needs jing et al 2020 the overall pass rate of cs is n 365 100 where n is the number of qualified days in a year the accuracy of spawning ground positioning also needed to be verified based on the measured flood process i e 2011 2012 2014 this research simulated the spatial distribution of spawning grounds in the reservoir area in the corresponding years according to the suitability proportion w of each section along the river this was then compared with the measured spatial location of the spawning ground to prove the accuracy of the fmccs reproduction suitability model 3 4 2 modelling scheme the spatial distribution of the spawning grounds of the fmccs under the condition of 2000 stochastic inflow flood events was then simulated and analyzed based on the verified hydrodynamic model and reproduction suitability model this analysis was mainly carried out in two parts first based on the two conditions during the pre and post dam periods the distribution and changes of the spawning grounds of the fmccs in the zhutuo tgd river section under different current conditions were analyzed then to clarify the impact of different dam scenarios on the spawning behavior of the fmccs this study further assumed and calculated the suitability of the fmccs in the tgr under two of the scenarios the low dam and middle dam scenarios in this study the no dam and high dam scenarios demote the flow condition of the pre and post dam periods respectively the tgr is currently in a period of normal operation which corresponds to the high dam scenario in the simulation process and the water level in front of the dam is maintained at 155 m on 1 may of each year the flow discharge from the tgr is increased in preparation for flood control thus the water level in front of the dam drops continuously from a starting level of 155 m to 145 m on 10 june the middle dam scenario corresponds to the initial operation period of the tgr the scheduling mode in this scenario is the same as in the normal operation period but the water level is lower in the dry season the water level in front of the dam gradually drops from 140 m to 135 m in this hypothetical low dam scenario in this study the water level in front of the dam follows the same scheduling mode dropping from 115 m to 105 m thus the four dam scenarios no dam low dam middle dam and high dam were expressed as the different water levels in front of the tgd table 3 4 results 4 1 calibration and verification of the stochastic flood model in this study the passing rate of each key parameter of the stochastic simulation sequence was tested among these parameters the relative error between the simulated and measured values of the coefficient of skewness cs was less than 15 which is qualified the pass standard for the remaining statistical parameters is no more than 10 table 4 shows the passing rate of the statistical parameters of the main inflow stations in the tgr according to the parameter passing rate of each station the simulated value of the parameter fits well with the measured value the simulation sequence generated by the periodic stationary autoregressive model of daily flow adequately reflects the hydrological characteristics of the measured sequence 4 2 simulation accuracy of the four major chinese carps reproduction suitability model based on the measured floods during the normal operation of the tgr in the post dam period i e in 2011 2012 and 2014 the spatial distribution of the spawning grounds under the measured flood situations was analyzed the results are presented in table 5 against the three measured floods in 2011 2012 and 2014 the simulated distribution of the spawning grounds was consistent with the situation reflected in the actual annual survey of the tgr in 2011 the simulated suitable spawning area for the fmccs in banan xiakouzhen section accounted for 42 3 of the river section the measured data from mu et al 2014 confirmed that this river section was the main spawning ground for the fmccs in 2011 consistent with the results of this study table 5 in 2012 the banan xiakouzhen section was again the main spawning ground for the fmccs at 65 4 of the river section consistent with the location of the spawning grounds identified in field investigations by mu 2014 in 2014 the suitability proportion w of the zhutuo jiangjin jiangjin banan and fuling puzituo river sections aligned with the measured data given in wang et al 2015 thereby indicating that the spawning grounds were correctly determined by our model therefore the model of fmccs reproduction suitability established here can be used to accurately locate the spawning grounds of these fishes in the upper reaches of the yangtze river 4 3 distribution of spawning grounds of the four major chinese carps during the pre and post dam periods 4 3 1 location of the four major chinese carps spawning grounds under stochastic flood conditions this study examined the reproduction suitability of the fmccs under pre and post dam scenarios the suitability proportion w of different river sections under 2000 stochastic flood events was counted to determine the location of the fmccs spawning grounds table 6 a comparison of the suitability proportions in the pre and post dam periods is shown in fig 4 the calculations indicated that construction of the tgd has greatly impacted the spawning activities of the fmccs the scale and locations of the spawning grounds underwent tremendous change in table 6 δ w is the change in w after dam construction relative to before dam construction simulation of the pre dam scenarios table 6 shows that the zhutuo tgd river section under natural flow conditions is suitable for spawning by the fmccs with average values of w ranging from 9 3 to 58 5 the w values for all river sections except for puzituo zhongxian and yunyang guling at 10 indicate that the spawning grounds of the fmccs in the pre dam period are densely distributed in the upper reaches of the yangtze river which is consistent with historical survey results and measured data yi et al 1988 based on the simulated results the evaluation accuracy of the fmccs reproduction suitability model has been further confirmed in the pre dam period the fmccs exhibit some spawning activities in the river between zhutuo and the tgd however since the completion of the tgd the impact on the water body in the reservoir area has become prominent the reach downstream from zhongxian is significantly affected and the flow conditions in front of the dam are not suitable for the fmccs to reproduce the spawning activities of the fmccs show an upstream shift and some spawning grounds gradually disappear in the post dam period the reach above zhongxian contains nine spawning grounds for the fmccs in the reservoir area between zhutuo and yunyang especially the fmccs have a higher reproduction suitability proportion in the zhutuo jiangjin section with a length of 60 km and in the banan zhongxian section with a length of 255 km table 6 4 3 2 impact of dam size on the four major chinese carps spawning grounds to clarify the impact of dam size on the spawning behavior of the fmccs this study further assumed and calculated the suitability of the fmccs in the tgr under two of the dam scenarios the low dam and middle dam scenarios table 7 the dam size is related to the water level in front of it as described in section 3 4 2 and table 3 therefore a simulation of the dam s size can be obtained by controlling the water level at the front of the dam according to the different dispatching water levels in front of the dam the pre dam situation corresponds to the no dam scenario and post dam to the high dam scenarios table 6 the calculation results of the four dam scenarios are shown in fig 5 and the changes of w between the three dam conditions and the no dam conditions are listed in table 8 5 discussion based on the simulation results shown in table 6 the spawning suitability of fmccs in the river reaches upstream and downstream of zhongxian changes with the construction of the tgd at the head of the tgr the zhutuo jiangjin and banan zhongxian river sections show relatively high suitability when compared with that in the pre dam period a possible explanation is that the high water depth in front of the dam usually changes slowly owning to the influence of backwater which directly reduces the spawning suitability of the fmccs in the lower reach of the tgr yang et al 2021 therefore the fmccs have to leave the original river reach to find a more suitable spawning ground in the backwater zone where the water depth velocity water temperature and water level fluctuation meet the species spawning requirements yang et al 2021 yi et al 2010 the luoqi fuling river section can provide 50 4 of suitable spawning area for the fmccs whereas the puzituo zhongxian river section near the middle reaches of the reservoir area can provide 18 9 the reach above zhongxian has gradually become a spawning ground for the fmccs although there are cases of proportionally high suitability under certain water flow conditions in the area in front of the dam e g the wushan badong and badong tgd river sections can provide 13 6 and 13 9 suitable area during some unusual flood periods respectively this area showed a small probability of forming a spawning ground for the fmccs only during the simulation of multiple floods therefore compared with natural water flows the impact of dam construction on the spawning grounds of the fmccs is significant through comparisons of the suitability proportion w under the four dam scenarios the w value of each spawning ground in the river section above zhongxian hardly differs among scenarios in the post dam period regardless of the size of the dam table 8 the low dam middle dam and high dam scenarios correspond to three operational periods of the tgd i e dam water levels of 135 m 156 m and 175 m respectively which all result in a fluctuating backwater zone of the tgr in the reach above zhongxian gao et al 2010 yang et al 2021 this situation may explain the relatively uniform high suitability proportions in the reach above zhongxian under the three dam scenarios in the post dam period there the luoqi fuling river section is the most suitable spawning ground for the fmccs however significant differences in w exist in the sections downstream of zhongxian under the different dam scenarios the main reason for this difference could be an increase in the backwater distance caused by the dam construction which leads to a decrease of velocity and less water level fluctuation in front of the dam fmccs cannot get enough flow and velocity stimulation to spawn so they have to move away from their original spawning grounds and migrate upstream under the scenario of building a low dam in the upper reaches of the yangtze river the variation trend in values of w along the way is consistent with the calculated results of the no dam scenario but generally lower than that of the water level without the dam the sections downstream of wanzhou will be most affected by the blockage of the dam at a scale of 64 km under the scenario of building the middle and high dams the river section below zhongxian is severely affected by the backwater accordingly the w values are low and suitable spawning grounds gradually disappear from these reaches under the middle dam and high dam scenarios 90 km and 101 km of spawning grounds disappear respectively thus construction of the dam not only directly prevents the downstream fmccs from returning to spawn but also causes a decrease in water velocity in front of the dam the larger size of the dam the larger influence on the water body in front of the dam and the slower water level fluctuation these impacts directly result in a longer backwater distance and a greater loss of spawning grounds with a larger dam consequently the fmccs gradually migrate upstream after losing suitable spawning conditions the proportion of suitable spawning ground in the river reach between luoqi and zhongxian increases under the three dam sizes and that in the reach between zhutuo and luoqi loses 57 km 54 km and 59 km of spawning habitat under the small middle and large dam scenarios respectively accounting for 90 60 and 59 of the total spawning grounds loss even though spawning grounds are lost after dam construction they are mainly distributed in the river reach above zhongxian and especially in the zhutuo jiangjin and banan zhongxian river sections 6 conclusions by coupling a hydrodynamic model and a model of fmccs reproduction suitability we simulated and analyzed the spatial distribution of spawning grounds of the fmcc as well as changes in the extent of suitable spawning ground in each river section in the pre dam and post dam periods in the upper reaches of the yangtze river under complex inflow conditions the main conclusions are 1 through the simulation and analysis of the spatial distribution of the spawning grounds of the fmccs under the stochastic flood process we determined that locations of suitable spawning grounds shift upstream compared with natural river conditions in the post dam period the fmccs have a higher reproduction suitability proportion in the zhutuo jiangjin length 60 km and banan zhongxian river sections length 255 km the reproduction suitability simulations results imply nine suitable spawning grounds for the fmccs in the upper reaches of the yangtze river between zhutuo and yuyang 2 through the simulation of four dam scenarios in the tgr in comparison with pre dam river conditions construction of the dam leads to fmccs spawning ground losses of 64 km under the low dam scenario 90 km under the middle dam scenario and 101 km under the high dam scenario the spawning ground lost in the reach between zhutuo and luoqi accounts for 90 60 and 59 of the total net loss respectively under the three dam sizes these results show that the ecological suitability of a dammed river for aquatic organisms is affected to varying degrees depending on the size of the dam credit

3359,solute transport models based on the resolution of the 3 d advection dispersion ad equation are frequently plagued by several numerical problems which add to the high computational cost the hydrological model nihm normally integrated hydrological model was recently proposed as a tool simulating the hydrological responses of watersheds with shallow saturated aquifers by coupling surface flow and a low dimensional subsurface system including the vadose zone in this paper we couple the low dimensional flow model nihm with a transport module solving the ad to propose an approach that enables to reduce the dimensionality of both the flow and transport problems in nihm the low dimensionality in the subsurface compartment results from an integration along the local direction normal to the bedrock of the aquifer nihm was previously evaluated and applied to actual hydrosystems without addressing mass transfers and it showed its ability to capture various hydrological responses even from complex systems however the relevance of a low dimensional approach to transport is not proven yet as the model reduction could also render approximated velocity fields inappropriate to mass transfer problems the accuracy and computational efficiency of the proposed model have been thoroughly examined through various synthetic test cases under different hydrodynamic conditions to assess the influence of the reduction of dimensionality on solute transport simulations the findings of this study demonstrate that the reduction of dimension remains suited to predicting solute transport behaviors in shallow subsurface systems while providing an important gain in computation time this might be promising for various applications dealing with groundwater quality keywords subsurface solute transport model reduction low dimensional model advection dispersion equation transport scheme 1 introduction water resources are polluted and contaminated by different anthropogenic activities major sources of pollutants may include intensive farming practices the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry urbanization population growth and improper sewer systems burri et al 2019 contaminants transported in the groundwater may remain for decades resulting in long term water quality degradation and many other environmental issues contaminant residence times usually depend on the properties and characteristics of the aquifer the overall hydrological conditions and the physical chemical characteristics of the contaminant itself by ranging from weeks to several years these residence times are able to threaten groundwater renewability and usability chapman and parker 2005 moeck et al 2017 exposure to water pollution can generate severe problems and might become a serious concern to human health and the environment wakida and lerner 2005 tackling these environmental challenges has shed light on the importance of effective groundwater management tools for water quality assessment and prediction mathematical modeling of solute transport in different hydrological systems has received particular attention from the hydrological community for years a tremendous number of studies have been specifically designed either in the theoretical or the applied domains with regard to groundwater contamination carnahan et al 1969 leij and van genuchten 1995 selim 1992 wu and jeng 2017 several analytical approximations and numerical approaches have been developed to reproduce solute transport behaviors in porous media barry and parker 1987 bosma and van der zee 1992 leij and van genuchten 1995 dou et al 1997 shan and javandel 1997 the migration of contaminant species associated with groundwater flow usually obeys elementary mechanisms such as advection diffusion dispersion and reaction in many groundwater transport models mass transport through porous media is described by the advection dispersion ad equation bear 1972 barry 1992 this equation can be solved either by numerical or analytical methods analytical solutions to the ad are available for specific initial and boundary conditions which mostly results in an applicability limited to simple geometries and homogeneous aquifers konikow et al 1997 tartakovsky 2000 rocha et al 2007 due to the complexity of actual natural systems numerical methods for solving the ad have been developed and are considered today as the best tools to account for the effect of aquifer heterogeneities various boundary conditions and diverse transient source sink terms in groundwater solute transport processes e g craig and rabideau 2006 boso et al 2013 for instance the modular 3 d transport model mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 was used for several applications to simulate changes over time and space in concentrations of groundwater contaminants zheng et al 2012 colombo et al 2019 lyra et al 2021 physically based models solving the ad with a full 3 d approach often face crucial problems mainly associated with numerical approximations of the continuous ad e g numerical dispersion of many discrete schemes the complexity of the discretization process and the high demand in computational resources etc fully physically based models such as hydrogeosphere therrien and sudicky 1996 graf and therrien 2005 and modflow mcdonald and harbaugh 1988 harbaugh et al 2000 are capable of simulating the fate of contaminants in groundwater and have been commonly used for a wide variety of problems in hydrology however with the classical computation resources available for a majority of practitioners but also researchers these models may need several days for running a single transport scenario when applied to large systems therefore large problems involving complex geometries and complicated systems render numerical solutions prohibitively expensive alternative numerical approaches have drawn the attention of both the hydrological and applied mathematics communities with the aim to reduce this computational burden and describe solute transport processes in a computationally efficient manner e g robinson et al 2012 rizzo et al 2018 the main idea is to make simpler physically based models in favor of faster computation and wider ranges of applications for groundwater management problems one of the interesting outcomes of these investigations is the development of low dimensional hydrological models for flow based on the reduction of the dimensionality of the problem troch et al 2003 pan et al 2015 delay and ackerer 2016 kong et al 2016 weill et al 2017 however only a few contributions assessed the effects of reduced dimensionality in simulating subsurface solute transport most studies targeted the flow problem in watersheds regarding transport the majority of recent low dimensional models mentioned in the literature are based on the pod proper orthogonal decomposition method this approach was introduced by sirovich 1987 as a first step a collection of snapshots is stored by running the original fully dimensional model then as a second step the pod technique is applied with the resulting singular vectors used as a basis for projection onto a subspace of lower dimensionality than the original model robinson et al 2012 nevertheless some non linearities associated with many real world groundwater systems may affect the correctness of the pod model another downside of the technique is the need for prior runs with a complete model including the imperative representation of the complete system before proceeding with the dimensionality reduction stated differently collecting beforehand an ensemble of reliable model responses for the fully dimensioned system is mandatory other approaches are now available for example a low dimensional approach was recently proposed in the hydrological model nihm normally integrated hydrological model pan et al 2015 weill et al 2017 jeannot et al 2018 2019 this model couples a low dimensional 2 d subsurface model to a 2 d overland flow and 1 d river flow and was shown to be efficient in reproducing the flow response of various complex hydrological systems jeannot et al 2018 2019 unlike simpler 2 d models mainly aimed at simulating the behavior of the saturated zone under planar horizontal flow that is by following the so called dupuit assumption nihm handles both the vadose and the saturated zones of the subsurface within a single 2 d compartment nevertheless it is worth noting that nihm was designed to mimic shallow subsurface systems the integration of the flow equation along a direction normal to bedrock simplifies the infiltration process from the surface within the vadose zone for details see jeannot et al 2018 2019 in short infiltration is simply viewed as a water transfer from the surface to the subsurface which changes over time and space the mean saturated hydraulic head evaluated along the direction of integration with thick vadose zones nihm might render rough local evaluations of mean water fluxes that do not completely depict the local flow processes in the vadose zone compared to a complete 3 d resolution of the richards equation that being said and especially regarding the present study contamination problems of subsurface water are all the more frequent when the aquifer is shallow this feature justifies a study on the consequences of the dimensionality reduction for flow onto solute transport the aim of the present contribution is to assess if the low dimensional method implemented in nihm can be extended to efficiently describe subsurface transport an approach coupling the flow module of nihm and a 2 d integrated advection dispersion transport module based is proposed this results in the so called nihm t low dimensional flow and transport models the evaluation of the approach is carried out through the comparison of results produced by nihm t and those produced by a fully dimensioned version of the code traces siegel et al 1998 younes et al 2010 the latter solves via advanced numerical methods a 3 d richards equation for flow in the vadose and saturated zones and a 3 d advection dispersion equation for solute transport it is worth noting that the model nihm is only devoted to solving flow in the various compartments of a watershed the t for transport module inherits from the experienced strategy and the numerical techniques of traces in its two dimensional version the resulting transport module is employed for solving a 2 d integrated ad with velocity fields inherited from the calculations by nihm for flow this not only avoids the complete implementation of a transport module in nihm but also facilitates the comparison between transport scenarios from a 2 d dimensionally reduced model and a full 3 d approach eventual discrepancies between both formalisms cannot be associated with eventual numerical differences by solving 2 d versus 3 d transport with different numerical methods the comparisons discussed hereafter are only the consequences of reducing the dimensionality of flow in a simplified subsurface model the paper is structured as follows we first introduce the physical and mathematical models for subsurface flow and solute transport in porous media then the coupling algorithm between the models nihm and the transport module inheriting from traces in its 2 d version for the coupling with nihm flow will be outlined finally the effects of reducing the dimensionality of the flow problem for solute transport will be detailed through applications to different synthetic test cases 2 low dimensional modeling of flow and transport in the subsurface the following section is dedicated to the description of the low dimensional flow and transport modeling approaches the subsurface model nihm is first briefly presented the low dimensional transport equation is then described the resolution strategy including a coupling between nihm and the 2 d transport module is detailed before giving the indicators that allow for the comparison of 2 d integrated transport results and those from full 3 d calculations 2 1 low dimensional subsurface flow model nihm subsurface flow modeling is carried out using the low dimensional subsurface module of the integrated hydrological model nihm pan et al 2015 jeannot et al 2018 the 2 d subsurface equation is derived from the integration of the 3 d richards equation richards 1931 along a direction normal to the bottom of the aquifer within a local eulerian coordinate system x y z defined by directions x y in the bedrock plane and z normal to the bedrock the integration bounds are the bedrock elevation z b and the soil surface elevation z s after integration along direction z the resulting low dimensional 2 d subsurface flow equation comes down to e g jeannot et al 2018 1 z b z s θ t s s s w θ h t d z z b z s k θ h d z z b z s q w d z where θ is the water content s w is the water saturation ss l 1 is the specific storage capacity of the medium k lt 1 is the tensor of hydraulic conductivity h l is the hydraulic head and q w t 1 is a source sink term the unsaturated soil hydraulic functions describing the nonlinear relationships between saturation water content and hydraulic conductivity are modeled using the mualem and van genuchten equations van genuchten 1980 this low dimensional approach assumes that the distribution of water pressure throughout the soil profile from the bedrock to the soil surface is simplified to evaluate the integral terms in eq 1 by calculating a single head value at each location x y and thus resulting in a 2 d approach for the sake of simplicity it is assumed that the pressure distribution along the direction normal to the bedrock is hydrostatic that is the flow is mainly parallel to bedrock as a consequence the description of flow through the unsaturated zone is simplified rainfall is directly applied as a recharge flux making the water table rise moisture in the unsaturated zone increases accordingly by following the hydrostatic capillary pressure hypothesis and the relationships between pressure and water saturation infiltration fronts and moisture storage in the unsaturated zone are not described the same way as would render a richards based approach furthermore the time variation of the water content θ is null in the saturated zone with s w 1 and the term in eq 1 including the specific storage capacity ss is usually negligible compared to the time variation of the water content within the unsaturated profile introducing the water table elevation z w as an integral bound and using the two previous assumptions eq 1 is rewritten as 2 θ t s h t t h q w where θ z w z s θ z d z s s s sat h and t k sat h z w z s k xy θ z d z note that in eq 2 h has become a mean hydraulic head along the direction normal to bedrock k sat and s s sat are the depth averaged saturated hydraulic conductivity tensor and specific storage capacity in the saturated zone respectively eq 2 is solved over an irregular triangular mesh using a crouzeix raviart finite element crfe scheme crouzeix and raviart 1973 an implicit scheme in time and a newton raphson algorithm to handle nonlinearity this approach has been tested in various hydrological configurations and successfully applied to several real world systems pan et al 2015 weill et al 2017 jeannot et al 2018 the results show that reducing dimensionality for flow preserves the main characteristics of the flow dynamics in a watershed while reducing the computation burden significantly 2 2 governing equation for low dimensional subsurface transport the low dimensional subsurface solute transport equation is derived using the same reduction approach as the one presented previously for subsurface flow in nihm but applied to the classical advection dispersion equation this equation is widely used to describe transport of solute and can be written as 3 θ c t θ d c q c q s where c ml 3 is the solute concentration d l2t 1 is the dispersion diffusion tensor including hydrodynamic dispersion and molecular diffusion q lt 1 is the darcy velocity of water θ is the water content and q s ml 3t 1 is the source sink term the dispersion diffusion tensor is defined by zheng and bennett 2002 4 d d pm i d h 5 d h i j α t u δ ij α l α t u i u j u 6 d pm d m τ where α l l is the longitudinal dispersivity α t l is the horizontal or vertical transverse dispersivity assumed identical u lt 1 is the mean pore velocity vector u q θ d l2t 1 is the dispersion tensor i is the identity matrix d pm l2t 1 is the molecular diffusion coefficient in the porous material d m l2t 1 is the molecular diffusion coefficient in pure water and τ is the tortuosity factor in our approach eq 3 is integrated along a direction normal to the bottom of the aquifer within the same local eulerian coordinate system x y z as defined for the low dimensional 2 d subsurface flow model the integration bounds are the bedrock elevation z b and the soil surface elevation z s eq 3 becomes 7 z b z s θ c t d z z b z s θ d c d z z b z s q c d z z b z s q s d z applying the leibnitz rule to each integral in eq 7 would transform for example a b f t d z into t a b f d z f b b t f a a t with the same transform also valid for the divergent operator with integration bounds z b and z s considered as constant over time and with negligible local gradient over space eq 7 can be rewritten as 8 t z b z s θ c d z z b z s θ d c d z z b z s q c d z q s q s being the local integral over z of the source sink term q s the low dimensional model assumes a hydrostatic head distribution in a direction normal to the bedrock that is a velocity parallel to the bedrock with no flow components along the local direction z the solute transport also becomes two dimensional handling mean concentration and transport parameters q d uniform over z by keeping the notation c as the mean concentration over z and extracting it from the integrals over z as it does not depend on z eq 8 becomes 9 t c z b z s θ z d z x y x y c z b z s θ d z d z x y c z b z s q z d z q s with x y the divergent or the gradient operators limited to the directions x y simplifying the notation in eq 9 renders 10 θ c t x y θ d x y c q c q s with 2 d mean parameters θ z b z s θ z d z q z b z s q z d z θ d z b z s θ d z d z 2 3 solution strategy the implementation of the low dimensional transport approach is based on the coupling of nihm flow with a solute transport module t module inheriting from the 2 d numerical implementations in traces nihm is used to solve flow in two dimensions over the whole simulated period the resulting water content and velocity fields required to solve the transport equation in eq 10 are stored at different time steps these flow data are then used as input by the 2 d version of the transport module t at the corresponding time to avoid mapping the data from a flow mesh to the transport mesh both numerical implementations share the same triangular mesh by default the nihm solutions for flow are saved at each of the time steps these time steps might be very small due to the non linearity of the flow equation to reduce the storage requirements and computer time necessary to solve the transport problem the results from nihm can be saved at selected time steps the selection criterion used here to save the flow data or not is based on the local i e at the element level variation of the velocity between time steps if the velocity difference between two successive time steps is greater than 1 in one element of the mesh the flow data water content and velocity fields are saved if not flow data are averaged over n 1 successive time steps until the difference in local velocities at the element scale between the times t 1 and t n is greater than 1 in at least one element of the mesh in the transport model the resolution of the ad equation both in 2 d and 3 d configurations is performed using an operator splitting approach the advective part is solved using the explicit discontinuous finite elements technique which is specifically designed to reduce numerical dispersion siegel et al 1998 for its part the diffusive term is solved using mixed hybrid finite elements a technique well known as being conservative for diffusion problems even at the scale of a single element younes et al 2010 the time step strategies initial time step minimum maximum time steps are defined by the user and automatically adapted by the code to read the flow data at the corresponding times and also to fulfill the courant criterion consequently global time steps are determined by the following constraint 15 δ t min a 2 a i 1 nb q γ i a where nb is the number of faces 3 d or edges 2 d a is the volume 3 d or area 2 d of the element a q γ i a are water fluxes across each edge γ i fulfilling the courant criterion avoids oscillations and contributes to the reduction of numerical diffusion it is also worth noting that in all the simulated transport scenario the element longitudinal and transverse peclet number have been kept to small values δ x α l 1 5 δ x α t 1 0 5 δ x is the mean size of an element in the mesh this features reduces the numerical dispersion compared with actual dispersion stemming from the eventual second order truncation terms of the discrete advection term 3 model performance evaluation 3 1 comparison strategy for models performance evaluation to assess the accuracy of the established low dimensional model for solute transport simulations performed with the low dimensional model nihm t 2 d flow plus transport are compared to fully 3 d simulations of saturated unsaturated flow and transport performed with traces 3 d the comparisons are based on local concentration values breakthrough curves btc and spatial moments of the concentration plume as concentrations provided by the 2 d simulations are mean values over the z direction a fair comparison with 3 d results suggests that concentrations provided by the 3 d simulations are also slightly processed to provide averages along z these depth averaged concentration values from the 3 d model are all weighted by the local fluxes for consistency with the 2 d transport model see eq 10 which relies upon an averaged flux q assuming that the 3 d domain at a location x y is discretized in nl elements along the direction z the depth averaged concentration c e is given by 11 c e j 1 n l c j q j j 1 n l q j where c j ml 3 is the subsurface solute concentration in element j of the 3 d mesh and q j ml 3 is related water flux the zeroth total mass in the system first center of mass and second spread of mass order spatial moments of the concentration in the system inform the shape of the solute plume they are well suited to the comparison of different methods for solving transport here 2 d versus 3 d as they do not target local pinpoint accuracy of a transport simulation but look at the overall behavior of the system in many practical applications local accuracy such as precise evaluation of concentration values cannot be compared with actual test cases simply because the measurements do not exist the first and second order spatial moments depend on the direction along which they are calculated in the various test cases discussed below these moments are only calculated along the x

1 nm c e θ e a e x ge 2 m 0 m x 1 2 where m 0 m is the zeroth order moment m x 1 l is the first order moment in the x direction and m x 2 l 2 is the second order moment in the x direction e is the index of a 2 d or 3 d element of the grid θ e is the average water content in element e x ge l is the x coordinate of the center of e a e l 3 is the area volume of element e and nm is the total number of elements in the domain it is worth noting that the concentrations c e in the calculations of moments from 3 d simulations are not averaged along the z direction comparing moments from 2 d versus 3 d approaches can show possible discrepancies associated with the distributions of concentrations and velocities along z in a 3 d configuration and not seen by the 2 d calculations 3 2 synthetic test cases and scenarios it was shown that for flow the reduction of the subsurface dimensionality rendered simplified velocity fields without resulting in noticeable errors both on heads in the subsurface and water fluxes collected at various scales of the system from e g exfiltration at a spring to the surface flowrates at the outlet of the watershed or leaks through a subsurface boundary condition pan et al 2015 jeannot et al 2018 2019 however these dimensionally reduced velocity fields could result in biased estimates of solute concentrations in 2 d the solute spreading over diverse streamlines is not correctly mimicked by transport along the single streamline averaging the diverse lines in 3 d stacked along the direction z of the flow integration for this paper six scenarios were specifically designed to assess the ability of nihm t to describe flow and transport processes scenarios s1 to s5 rely upon the domain configuration given in fig 1 that is purposely set up to simplify the various interpretations that will be given when comparing 3 d and 2 d integrated transport results the computational domain is a 100 m 20 m 10 m parallelepiped representing a synthetic unconfined aquifer the bottom and top elevations of the domain are set to 0 m and 10 m respectively for the comparison with traces 3 d model the whole domain is meshed via 56 000 hexahedron elements of uniform size 1 m over x and y directions along the vertical z direction the mesh is refined in the first meter close to the surface to improve numerical stability and provide accurate numerical solutions in the unsaturated infiltration area as a consequence the subsurface model is discretized into 28 horizontal layers of increasing thickness from 10 cm at the top to 50 cm at the bottom regarding the low dimensional 2 d model the grid composed of 4 000 triangular elements and 2 121 nodes is obtained by splitting in two the four edge horizontal facets of the first layer of the 3 d mesh for the btcs comparisons the element 2 d concentrations are the average of the two elements split from the 3 d grid to match the 3 d horizontal grid and the element 3 d concentrations are the depth averaged concentrations over the 28 layers flow and transport scenarios s1 to s5 were carried out in a heterogeneous block of hydraulic conductivity the log10 hydraulic conductivities obey a spherical covariance function with a mean of 3 5 a variance of 1 0 conductivities expressed in m s 1 and a correlation length of 60 m and 15 m in the horizontal and vertical directions respectively fig 1 the field has been generated using a sequential gaussian method described in gslib geostatistical software library deutsch and journel 1997 all the other flow and transport parameters are considered uniform over space the porosity is set to ϕ 0 15 and the specific storage to ss 5 10 3 m 1 the parameters for the mualem van genuchten equations are set to α 1 m 1 and n 2 for the transport problem the longitudinal dispersivity coefficient is assigned α l 5 m the horizontal and vertical for 3 d transverse dispersivity coefficients are taken as α t 0 5 m and the molecular diffusion coefficient in the porous material is equal to 10 9 m2 s 1 for the 2 d domain the hydraulic conductivities are integrated over depth taking care to consider the different layer thicknesses for flow dirichlet boundary conditions are prescribed on two opposite faces at x 0 and x 100 m while the other lateral faces and the bottom of the domain are considered as null flux neumann boundaries dirichlet head values are adjusted according to the targeted hydrological situations fully saturated and partially saturated described below using the above mentioned properties different initial and boundary conditions for the flow and transport problems were defined in scenarios s1 to s5 under transient flow conditions as summarized in table 1 for the first scenario s1 the domain is fully saturated the initial hydraulic head is set at 10 m and constant hydraulic heads are set to 12 m and 10 m at the dirichlet boundaries in x 0 m and x 100 m respectively fig 2 for the second scenario s2 the domain is partially saturated with an initial water table located 3 m below the soil surface the dirichlet boundaries in 0 m and x 100 m are set to h1 8 m and h2 7 m respectively as shown in fig 3 a uniform rainfall of 2 10 7 m s 1 is applied during the first 5 days at the surface of the domain the third scenario s3 is close to the second one but the initial water table and dirichlet boundary conditions are chosen to increase the unsaturated thickness and assess the effect of the hydrostatic pressure assumption for flow on the simulated transport the initial hydraulic head is thus set to 5 m the constant hydraulic head h1 6 m is imposed at x 0 m and h2 5 m is prescribed at 100 m see fig 3 for solute transport in the three configurations s1 s2 and s3 the initial concentration is equal to 0 except in a vertical column crossing the whole aquifer thickness and rectangular horizontal section extending within x 26 32 m and y 8 13 m fig 2 and fig 3 at this location the solute is injected through a source term evenly distributed over the 10 m depth of the system the injected mass is set to 6 10 3 kg s 1 for a duration of 3 days all boundaries are set to zero solute dispersion flux as contaminants can also reach groundwater from inlets at the land surface additional scenarios s4 and s5 only valid for the 3 d problem limit the contaminant injection to a surface area also located within x 26 32 m y 8 13 m but only over a thickness of 10 cm from the top of the domain as shown in fig 4 in 2 d s4 and s5 come down to an injection over the whole thickness of the system as 2 d simulations do not distinguish the surface from the depth the flow problem in scenarios s4 and s5 is very similar to that of scenario s2 but for s4 to diminish the thickness of the unsaturated zone the initial hydraulic head is set to 9 m and constant hydraulic heads h1 10 m and h2 9 m are imposed at x 0 m and at x 100 m respectively see fig 4 the simulated period is 16 days and a maximum time step length of 1 hr is prescribed for both the flow and transport simulations scenario 6 s6 is designed to assess the quality of the modeling approach in a more complex configuration with a tilted and bumpy bottom of the aquifer and more variable hydrological conditions the domain consists of two triangular hillslopes connected to a 140 m long and 6 m wide channel presented in fig 5 the surface slopes in the x and y direction are of 0 05 and 0 02 respectively the substratum bottom elevation of the aquifer is first defined by supposing it parallel to the surface with a thickness of the subsurface domain set to 20 m then the elevation of the substratum for each computation node is modified to render a bumped surface adding a perturbation randomly sampled with a 1 m uniform distribution for the traces 3 d model the whole system is meshed using 123 368 hexahedron elements of uniform size 2 m over x and y directions the domain is discretized into 45 layers of increasing thickness along the vertical z direction the computational mesh is refined close to the surface to better capture the infiltration dynamics for sake of consistency the integration in the flow model is performed using similar integration steps to evaluate the equivalent 2 d parameters the mesh grid in nihm t is composed of 3 220 triangular elements generated as for the preceding applications by splitting in two the horizontal 2 d elements of the top layer of the 3 d mesh the saturated hydraulic conductivity field is generated using the same technique as the one for the previous scenarios with an anisotropic spherical covariance of 60 m correlation length in the horizontal directions and of 15 m in the vertical direction the resulting statistical distribution of the log10 of conductivity values is gaussian of mean 4 56 and spans the range 6 25 2 95 the heterogeneous conductivity field was first generated into a parallelepiped as shown in fig 6 and then interpolated onto the computational meshes used for both nihm t and traces the van genuchten parameters α and n in the relationships between saturation water content and hydraulic conductivity are set to 1 m 1 and 2 respectively the lateral boundaries of the domain are considered as no flow boundaries hydraulic heads of 19 m and 24 8 m are imposed to the downhill and top limits of the domain respectively the initial conditions are set using a linear interpolation between the boundary conditions at the down and top limits the total time of simulation is 800 days rainfall is applied at the surface of the domain with a 2 10 7 m s 1 rate for 20 days every 60 days thus resulting in transient flow conditions over the whole simulation period for transport a source term of 1 6 10 4 kg s 1 is imposed in the computational meshes located at the surface and presented in orange in fig 5 for a duration of 300 days in the transport problem the longitudinal dispersivity coefficient is assigned α l 5 m the horizontal and vertical for 3 d transverse dispersivity coefficients are taken as α t 0 5 m and the molecular diffusion coefficient in the porous material is equal to 10 9 m2 s 1 the evolutions over time of average concentrations and statistical moments are compared between nihm t and traces 3d at points 3 and 4 posted in fig 5 4 results and discussion figure 7 shows the evolution over time of the average concentrations in scenario s1 at two selected points p1 x 50 m y 10 m and p2 x 70 m y 13 m displayed in fig 2 the evolution of the first order and second order moments for the first scenario s1 are shown in fig 8 the results produced by the low dimensional approach and traces 3 d are very close with a maximum root mean square error rmse for average concentrations of only 5 56 10 3 kg m 3 the btcs and the evolution of the zeroth first and second order moments demonstrate that in fully saturated conditions the low dimensional model can accurately reproduce the spatial evolution of the plume and the transport processes in a heterogeneous saturated hydraulic conductivity field this feature was expected in the absence of an unsaturated zone a specific case in which the averaging integration technique is reliable for both flow and transport in heterogeneous porous media the pairs fig 9 fig 10 and fig 11 fig 12 display the evolutions of the same variables that is btcs in p1 and p2 and spatial moments for scenarios s2 and s3 respectively in both cases the shapes of the btcs are similar but with a maximum value of concentrations higher for the 2 d approach and a maximum rmse of 8 21 10 2 kg m 3 for average concentrations when the thickness of the unsaturated zone is the highest s3 fig 11 the zeroth order moments show that the solute plumes reach the downstream boundary after 3 days just when the solute injection has stopped irrespective of the simulation s2 or s3 and the 2 d versus 3 d approaches the first order moments are close at the beginning of the simulation and become higher for the 2 d model this observation goes with the fact that the 3 d simulation with an explicit representation of the vadose zone might trap solute mass in low velocity areas of the shallow subsurface the mean location of the solute plume in 2 d moves slightly quicker and also goes slightly farther downstream than in 3 d in relation with the eventual trapping of solute in the vadose zone of the 3 d model the second order moments associated with the spreading of concentration over space are slightly higher for the full model these differences between models increase with the thickness of the unsaturated zone compare fig 9 with fig 11 and fig 10 with fig 12 and could be the consequence of the simplifications in the 2 d model where the unsaturated zone is described by hydrostatic heads only the mean velocities along the z direction could not fully coincide with the mean sampled by the 3 d model the recharge in s2 and s3 also generates vertical velocities which cannot be properly taken into account in the integrated model as we already mentioned by stating that infiltration is only seen in nihm as a variation of hydraulic heads this is confirmed by the snapshots presented in fig 13 and fig 14 for very similar shapes of the 2 d solute plume between scenarios s2 and s3 the vertical cross sections of the 3 d model clearly indicate that a thicker vadose zone increases the solute mass trapped just beneath the surface as told earlier in the fully 3 d simulations solute remains trapped in the unsaturated zone where velocities are very low compared to the saturated zone this trapping decreases the concentration peaks reduces the average velocity sampled by the solute and increases the dispersion of the contaminant in the 3 d configurations when the solute is only injected at the top surface of the domain the reduced model can underestimate the contaminant storage in the unsaturated zone for the fourth scenario s4 where the vadose zone is thin approximately one meter over the whole system the results in fig 15 and fig 16 clearly indicate that the low dimensional model reproduces fairly well the 3 d model results with a maximum rmse of 5 51 10 2 k g m 3 for average concentrations fig 15 when the unsaturated zone is thicker s5 its effects on solute transport are amplified compared to those seen for the column type concentration source the solute which was initially only concentrated in the upper part of the unsaturated zone remains trapped in areas of weak velocities only a little mass experiences the higher velocities of the saturated zone beneath therefore the overall transport is retarded renders lower solute peak values figs 17 and 18 and increased spreading fig 18 this is confirmed by the evolution of the zeroth order moments which illustrate a faster reduction in contaminant mass from day three in the reduced model the results presented in fig 19 and fig 20 for scenario s6 whose geometrical and hydrological conditions are more complex show the same overall trend for both average concentration and statistical moments evolutions as the unsaturated zone is deeper at point 3 than at point 4 due to the initial conditions the difference between the average concentrations produced by nihm t and traces 3 d is more pronounced at point 3 at both locations the reduced model performs well and is able to capture the transport dynamics the evolution over time of the zeroth first and second order moments plot in fig 20 also show that nihm t captures the spatial evolution of the plume even if the geometrical configuration of the domain and the history of flow and transport are more complex regarding the computational cost cpu times are recorded and compared for each model both models nihm t and traces 3 d are calculated on a standard desktop computer and the calculation time is related to the simulation period scenarios s1 to s5 16 days scenario s6 800 days the gain in computation time using the integrated model nihm is notable when reproducing subsurface flow and solute transport table 2 lists cpu times by distinguishing them between solving flow or transport as expected the low dimensional approach significantly reduces cpu times this is linked to the number of unknowns scenarios s1 to s5 12 240 in 2 d and 346 720 in 3 d scenario s6 9 886 in 2 d and 768 912 in 3 d and non linear flow conditions in the unsaturated zone we recall here that flow in the unsaturated zone is solved explicitly in 3 d and described by hydrostatic conditions in the low dimensional model 5 conclusions a low dimensional model has been proposed to describe the non reactive transport behavior of contaminants in the subsurface this investigation shows that the advection dispersion equation can be expressed with a reduced dimensionality by relying upon the low dimensional hydrological model nihm which calculates averaged water fluxes considering both the unsaturated and saturated zones of a shallow subsurface system the proposed approach has been tested on different heterogeneous synthetic test cases via a comparison with a full 3 d approach for both flow and transport the results indicate that the reduced model nihm t for both coupled flow and transport performs well under saturated flow conditions even in heterogeneous systems when applied to partially saturated heterogeneous aquifers the presence of a vadose zone can add further complexity because of the non negligible three directional components of water fluxes and their variations over time and space in the subsurface as the low dimensional model neglects the vertical components of flow assuming hydrostatic conditions the resulting mean water velocity fields can be partially flawed the main impact on transport comes from the relative thickness of the unsaturated zone compared with that of the saturated zone in the 2 d approach with flow integrated normal to bedrock the hydrostatic assumption needed for building an averaged 2 d field of mean velocities may overlook the variability of hydraulic conductivities due to variable saturations the direct result is a raw evaluation of water velocities in the system which directly impacts solute transport the 3 d configurations with sources of concentrations uniformly distributed over the whole thickness of the system can be correctly reproduced by a 2 d calculation simply because an injection at the surface in 2 d is equivalent to a uniform injection over depth in 3 d for the 3 d problems where the injection plug is limited to the first top layers of the domain the 3 d calculations will account for variable injection conditions over depth according to infiltration and vertical flow components for its part the 2 d approach will still consider that the concentration at the injection plug is uniform over depth in such applications the results reveal that the approximations associated with the integration of flow in 2 d nihm increase discrepancies between 2 d and 3 d as the thickness of the unsaturated zone increases and infiltration and time varying vertical water velocities become key features of the hydrological system however and notwithstanding its basic assumptions the reduced model is found to be practical for simulating solute transport in porous media for shallow aquifers in addition to simplifying mass transfer modeling it is worth mentioning that the cpu time required for the reduced model is significantly less compared to a full 3 d calculation overall in this study the low dimensional model is highlighted as an alternative for simulating water quality with this aim in mind further works would couple surface and subsurface solute transport processes to investigate actual

3359,solute transport models based on the resolution of the 3 d advection dispersion ad equation are frequently plagued by several numerical problems which add to the high computational cost the hydrological model nihm normally integrated hydrological model was recently proposed as a tool simulating the hydrological responses of watersheds with shallow saturated aquifers by coupling surface flow and a low dimensional subsurface system including the vadose zone in this paper we couple the low dimensional flow model nihm with a transport module solving the ad to propose an approach that enables to reduce the dimensionality of both the flow and transport problems in nihm the low dimensionality in the subsurface compartment results from an integration along the local direction normal to the bedrock of the aquifer nihm was previously evaluated and applied to actual hydrosystems without addressing mass transfers and it showed its ability to capture various hydrological responses even from complex systems however the relevance of a low dimensional approach to transport is not proven yet as the model reduction could also render approximated velocity fields inappropriate to mass transfer problems the accuracy and computational efficiency of the proposed model have been thoroughly examined through various synthetic test cases under different hydrodynamic conditions to assess the influence of the reduction of dimensionality on solute transport simulations the findings of this study demonstrate that the reduction of dimension remains suited to predicting solute transport behaviors in shallow subsurface systems while providing an important gain in computation time this might be promising for various applications dealing with groundwater quality keywords subsurface solute transport model reduction low dimensional model advection dispersion equation transport scheme 1 introduction water resources are polluted and contaminated by different anthropogenic activities major sources of pollutants may include intensive farming practices the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry urbanization population growth and improper sewer systems burri et al 2019 contaminants transported in the groundwater may remain for decades resulting in long term water quality degradation and many other environmental issues contaminant residence times usually depend on the properties and characteristics of the aquifer the overall hydrological conditions and the physical chemical characteristics of the contaminant itself by ranging from weeks to several years these residence times are able to threaten groundwater renewability and usability chapman and parker 2005 moeck et al 2017 exposure to water pollution can generate severe problems and might become a serious concern to human health and the environment wakida and lerner 2005 tackling these environmental challenges has shed light on the importance of effective groundwater management tools for water quality assessment and prediction mathematical modeling of solute transport in different hydrological systems has received particular attention from the hydrological community for years a tremendous number of studies have been specifically designed either in the theoretical or the applied domains with regard to groundwater contamination carnahan et al 1969 leij and van genuchten 1995 selim 1992 wu and jeng 2017 several analytical approximations and numerical approaches have been developed to reproduce solute transport behaviors in porous media barry and parker 1987 bosma and van der zee 1992 leij and van genuchten 1995 dou et al 1997 shan and javandel 1997 the migration of contaminant species associated with groundwater flow usually obeys elementary mechanisms such as advection diffusion dispersion and reaction in many groundwater transport models mass transport through porous media is described by the advection dispersion ad equation bear 1972 barry 1992 this equation can be solved either by numerical or analytical methods analytical solutions to the ad are available for specific initial and boundary conditions which mostly results in an applicability limited to simple geometries and homogeneous aquifers konikow et al 1997 tartakovsky 2000 rocha et al 2007 due to the complexity of actual natural systems numerical methods for solving the ad have been developed and are considered today as the best tools to account for the effect of aquifer heterogeneities various boundary conditions and diverse transient source sink terms in groundwater solute transport processes e g craig and rabideau 2006 boso et al 2013 for instance the modular 3 d transport model mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 was used for several applications to simulate changes over time and space in concentrations of groundwater contaminants zheng et al 2012 colombo et al 2019 lyra et al 2021 physically based models solving the ad with a full 3 d approach often face crucial problems mainly associated with numerical approximations of the continuous ad e g numerical dispersion of many discrete schemes the complexity of the discretization process and the high demand in computational resources etc fully physically based models such as hydrogeosphere therrien and sudicky 1996 graf and therrien 2005 and modflow mcdonald and harbaugh 1988 harbaugh et al 2000 are capable of simulating the fate of contaminants in groundwater and have been commonly used for a wide variety of problems in hydrology however with the classical computation resources available for a majority of practitioners but also researchers these models may need several days for running a single transport scenario when applied to large systems therefore large problems involving complex geometries and complicated systems render numerical solutions prohibitively expensive alternative numerical approaches have drawn the attention of both the hydrological and applied mathematics communities with the aim to reduce this computational burden and describe solute transport processes in a computationally efficient manner e g robinson et al 2012 rizzo et al 2018 the main idea is to make simpler physically based models in favor of faster computation and wider ranges of applications for groundwater management problems one of the interesting outcomes of these investigations is the development of low dimensional hydrological models for flow based on the reduction of the dimensionality of the problem troch et al 2003 pan et al 2015 delay and ackerer 2016 kong et al 2016 weill et al 2017 however only a few contributions assessed the effects of reduced dimensionality in simulating subsurface solute transport most studies targeted the flow problem in watersheds regarding transport the majority of recent low dimensional models mentioned in the literature are based on the pod proper orthogonal decomposition method this approach was introduced by sirovich 1987 as a first step a collection of snapshots is stored by running the original fully dimensional model then as a second step the pod technique is applied with the resulting singular vectors used as a basis for projection onto a subspace of lower dimensionality than the original model robinson et al 2012 nevertheless some non linearities associated with many real world groundwater systems may affect the correctness of the pod model another downside of the technique is the need for prior runs with a complete model including the imperative representation of the complete system before proceeding with the dimensionality reduction stated differently collecting beforehand an ensemble of reliable model responses for the fully dimensioned system is mandatory other approaches are now available for example a low dimensional approach was recently proposed in the hydrological model nihm normally integrated hydrological model pan et al 2015 weill et al 2017 jeannot et al 2018 2019 this model couples a low dimensional 2 d subsurface model to a 2 d overland flow and 1 d river flow and was shown to be efficient in reproducing the flow response of various complex hydrological systems jeannot et al 2018 2019 unlike simpler 2 d models mainly aimed at simulating the behavior of the saturated zone under planar horizontal flow that is by following the so called dupuit assumption nihm handles both the vadose and the saturated zones of the subsurface within a single 2 d compartment nevertheless it is worth noting that nihm was designed to mimic shallow subsurface systems the integration of the flow equation along a direction normal to bedrock simplifies the infiltration process from the surface within the vadose zone for details see jeannot et al 2018 2019 in short infiltration is simply viewed as a water transfer from the surface to the subsurface which changes over time and space the mean saturated hydraulic head evaluated along the direction of integration with thick vadose zones nihm might render rough local evaluations of mean water fluxes that do not completely depict the local flow processes in the vadose zone compared to a complete 3 d resolution of the richards equation that being said and especially regarding the present study contamination problems of subsurface water are all the more frequent when the aquifer is shallow this feature justifies a study on the consequences of the dimensionality reduction for flow onto solute transport the aim of the present contribution is to assess if the low dimensional method implemented in nihm can be extended to efficiently describe subsurface transport an approach coupling the flow module of nihm and a 2 d integrated advection dispersion transport module based is proposed this results in the so called nihm t low dimensional flow and transport models the evaluation of the approach is carried out through the comparison of results produced by nihm t and those produced by a fully dimensioned version of the code traces siegel et al 1998 younes et al 2010 the latter solves via advanced numerical methods a 3 d richards equation for flow in the vadose and saturated zones and a 3 d advection dispersion equation for solute transport it is worth noting that the model nihm is only devoted to solving flow in the various compartments of a watershed the t for transport module inherits from the experienced strategy and the numerical techniques of traces in its two dimensional version the resulting transport module is employed for solving a 2 d integrated ad with velocity fields inherited from the calculations by nihm for flow this not only avoids the complete implementation of a transport module in nihm but also facilitates the comparison between transport scenarios from a 2 d dimensionally reduced model and a full 3 d approach eventual discrepancies between both formalisms cannot be associated with eventual numerical differences by solving 2 d versus 3 d transport with different numerical methods the comparisons discussed hereafter are only the consequences of reducing the dimensionality of flow in a simplified subsurface model the paper is structured as follows we first introduce the physical and mathematical models for subsurface flow and solute transport in porous media then the coupling algorithm between the models nihm and the transport module inheriting from traces in its 2 d version for the coupling with nihm flow will be outlined finally the effects of reducing the dimensionality of the flow problem for solute transport will be detailed through applications to different synthetic test cases 2 low dimensional modeling of flow and transport in the subsurface the following section is dedicated to the description of the low dimensional flow and transport modeling approaches the subsurface model nihm is first briefly presented the low dimensional transport equation is then described the resolution strategy including a coupling between nihm and the 2 d transport module is detailed before giving the indicators that allow for the comparison of 2 d integrated transport results and those from full 3 d calculations 2 1 low dimensional subsurface flow model nihm subsurface flow modeling is carried out using the low dimensional subsurface module of the integrated hydrological model nihm pan et al 2015 jeannot et al 2018 the 2 d subsurface equation is derived from the integration of the 3 d richards equation richards 1931 along a direction normal to the bottom of the aquifer within a local eulerian coordinate system x y z defined by directions x y in the bedrock plane and z normal to the bedrock the integration bounds are the bedrock elevation z b and the soil surface elevation z s after integration along direction z the resulting low dimensional 2 d subsurface flow equation comes down to e g jeannot et al 2018 1 z b z s θ t s s s w θ h t d z z b z s k θ h d z z b z s q w d z where θ is the water content s w is the water saturation ss l 1 is the specific storage capacity of the medium k lt 1 is the tensor of hydraulic conductivity h l is the hydraulic head and q w t 1 is a source sink term the unsaturated soil hydraulic functions describing the nonlinear relationships between saturation water content and hydraulic conductivity are modeled using the mualem and van genuchten equations van genuchten 1980 this low dimensional approach assumes that the distribution of water pressure throughout the soil profile from the bedrock to the soil surface is simplified to evaluate the integral terms in eq 1 by calculating a single head value at each location x y and thus resulting in a 2 d approach for the sake of simplicity it is assumed that the pressure distribution along the direction normal to the bedrock is hydrostatic that is the flow is mainly parallel to bedrock as a consequence the description of flow through the unsaturated zone is simplified rainfall is directly applied as a recharge flux making the water table rise moisture in the unsaturated zone increases accordingly by following the hydrostatic capillary pressure hypothesis and the relationships between pressure and water saturation infiltration fronts and moisture storage in the unsaturated zone are not described the same way as would render a richards based approach furthermore the time variation of the water content θ is null in the saturated zone with s w 1 and the term in eq 1 including the specific storage capacity ss is usually negligible compared to the time variation of the water content within the unsaturated profile introducing the water table elevation z w as an integral bound and using the two previous assumptions eq 1 is rewritten as 2 θ t s h t t h q w where θ z w z s θ z d z s s s sat h and t k sat h z w z s k xy θ z d z note that in eq 2 h has become a mean hydraulic head along the direction normal to bedrock k sat and s s sat are the depth averaged saturated hydraulic conductivity tensor and specific storage capacity in the saturated zone respectively eq 2 is solved over an irregular triangular mesh using a crouzeix raviart finite element crfe scheme crouzeix and raviart 1973 an implicit scheme in time and a newton raphson algorithm to handle nonlinearity this approach has been tested in various hydrological configurations and successfully applied to several real world systems pan et al 2015 weill et al 2017 jeannot et al 2018 the results show that reducing dimensionality for flow preserves the main characteristics of the flow dynamics in a watershed while reducing the computation burden significantly 2 2 governing equation for low dimensional subsurface transport the low dimensional subsurface solute transport equation is derived using the same reduction approach as the one presented previously for subsurface flow in nihm but applied to the classical advection dispersion equation this equation is widely used to describe transport of solute and can be written as 3 θ c t θ d c q c q s where c ml 3 is the solute concentration d l2t 1 is the dispersion diffusion tensor including hydrodynamic dispersion and molecular diffusion q lt 1 is the darcy velocity of water θ is the water content and q s ml 3t 1 is the source sink term the dispersion diffusion tensor is defined by zheng and bennett 2002 4 d d pm i d h 5 d h i j α t u δ ij α l α t u i u j u 6 d pm d m τ where α l l is the longitudinal dispersivity α t l is the horizontal or vertical transverse dispersivity assumed identical u lt 1 is the mean pore velocity vector u q θ d l2t 1 is the dispersion tensor i is the identity matrix d pm l2t 1 is the molecular diffusion coefficient in the porous material d m l2t 1 is the molecular diffusion coefficient in pure water and τ is the tortuosity factor in our approach eq 3 is integrated along a direction normal to the bottom of the aquifer within the same local eulerian coordinate system x y z as defined for the low dimensional 2 d subsurface flow model the integration bounds are the bedrock elevation z b and the soil surface elevation z s eq 3 becomes 7 z b z s θ c t d z z b z s θ d c d z z b z s q c d z z b z s q s d z applying the leibnitz rule to each integral in eq 7 would transform for example a b f t d z into t a b f d z f b b t f a a t with the same transform also valid for the divergent operator with integration bounds z b and z s considered as constant over time and with negligible local gradient over space eq 7 can be rewritten as 8 t z b z s θ c d z z b z s θ d c d z z b z s q c d z q s q s being the local integral over z of the source sink term q s the low dimensional model assumes a hydrostatic head distribution in a direction normal to the bedrock that is a velocity parallel to the bedrock with no flow components along the local direction z the solute transport also becomes two dimensional handling mean concentration and transport parameters q d uniform over z by keeping the notation c as the mean concentration over z and extracting it from the integrals over z as it does not depend on z eq 8 becomes 9 t c z b z s θ z d z x y x y c z b z s θ d z d z x y c z b z s q z d z q s with x y the divergent or the gradient operators limited to the

implementation of the low dimensional transport approach is based on the coupling of nihm flow with a solute transport module t module inheriting from the 2 d numerical implementations in traces nihm is used to solve flow in two dimensions over the whole simulated period the resulting water content and velocity fields required to solve the transport equation in eq 10 are stored at different time steps these flow data are then used as input by the 2 d version of the transport module t at the corresponding time to avoid mapping the data from a flow mesh to the transport mesh both numerical implementations share the same triangular mesh by default the nihm solutions for flow are saved at each of the time steps these time steps might be very small due to the non linearity of the flow equation to reduce the storage requirements and computer time necessary to solve the transport problem the results from nihm can be saved at selected time steps the selection criterion used here to save the flow data or not is based on the local i e at the element level variation of the velocity between time steps if the velocity difference between two successive time steps is greater than 1 in one element of the mesh the flow data water content and velocity fields are saved if not flow data are averaged over n 1 successive time steps until the difference in local velocities at the element scale between the times t 1 and t n is greater than 1 in at least one element of the mesh in the transport model the resolution of the ad equation both in 2 d and 3 d configurations is performed using an operator splitting approach the advective part is solved using the explicit discontinuous finite elements technique which is specifically designed to reduce numerical dispersion siegel et al 1998 for its part the diffusive term is solved using mixed hybrid finite elements a technique well known as being conservative for diffusion problems even at the scale of a single element younes et al 2010 the time step strategies initial time step minimum maximum time steps are defined by the user and automatically adapted by the code to read the flow data at the corresponding times and also to fulfill the courant criterion consequently global time steps are determined by the following constraint 15 δ t min a 2 a i 1 nb q γ i a where nb is the number of faces 3 d or edges 2 d a is the volume 3 d or area 2 d of the element a q γ i a are water fluxes across each edge γ i fulfilling the courant criterion avoids oscillations and contributes to the reduction of numerical diffusion it is also worth noting that in all the simulated transport scenario the element longitudinal and transverse peclet number have been kept to small values δ x α l 1 5 δ x α t 1 0 5 δ x is the mean size of an element in the mesh this features reduces the numerical dispersion compared with actual dispersion stemming from the eventual second order truncation terms of the discrete advection term 3 model performance evaluation 3 1 comparison strategy for models performance evaluation to assess the accuracy of the established low dimensional model for solute transport simulations performed with the low dimensional model nihm t 2 d flow plus transport are compared to fully 3 d simulations of saturated unsaturated flow and transport performed with traces 3 d the comparisons are based on local concentration values breakthrough curves btc and spatial moments of the concentration plume as concentrations provided by the 2 d simulations are mean values over the z direction a fair comparison with 3 d results suggests that concentrations provided by the 3 d simulations are also slightly processed to provide averages along z these depth averaged concentration values from the 3 d model are all weighted by the local fluxes for consistency with the 2 d transport model see eq 10 which relies upon an averaged flux q assuming that the 3 d domain at a location x y is discretized in nl elements along the direction z the depth averaged concentration c e is given by 11 c e j 1 n l c j q j j 1 n l q j where c j ml 3 is the subsurface solute concentration in element j of the 3 d mesh and q j ml 3 is related water flux the zeroth total mass in the system first center of mass and second spread of mass order spatial moments of the concentration in the system inform the shape of the solute plume they are well suited to the comparison of different methods for solving transport here 2 d versus 3 d as they do not target local pinpoint accuracy of a transport simulation but look at the overall behavior of the system in many practical applications local accuracy such as precise evaluation of concentration values cannot be compared with actual test cases simply because the measurements do not exist the first and second order spatial moments depend on the direction along which they are calculated in the various test cases discussed below these moments are only calculated along the x direction corresponding to the main flow direction of all settings moments are computed according to the following expressions 12 m 0 e 1 nm c e θ e a e 13 m x 1 e 1 nm c e θ e a e x ge m 0 14 m x 2 e 1 nm c e θ e a e x ge 2 m 0 m x 1 2 where m 0 m is the zeroth order moment m x 1 l is the first order moment in the x direction and m x 2 l 2 is the second order moment in the x direction e is the index of a 2 d or 3 d element of the grid θ e is the average water content in element e x ge l is the x coordinate of the center of e a e l 3 is the area volume of element e and nm is the total number of elements in the domain it is worth noting that the concentrations c e in the calculations of moments from 3 d simulations are not averaged along the z direction comparing moments from 2 d versus 3 d approaches can show possible discrepancies associated with the distributions of concentrations and velocities along z in a 3 d configuration and not seen by the 2 d calculations 3 2 synthetic test cases and scenarios it was shown that for flow the reduction of the subsurface dimensionality rendered simplified velocity fields without resulting in noticeable errors both on heads in the subsurface and water fluxes collected at various scales of the system from e g exfiltration at a spring to the surface flowrates at the outlet of the watershed or leaks through a subsurface boundary condition pan et al 2015 jeannot et al 2018 2019 however these dimensionally reduced velocity fields could result in biased estimates of solute concentrations in 2 d the solute spreading over diverse streamlines is not correctly mimicked by transport along the single streamline averaging the diverse lines in 3 d stacked along the direction z of the flow integration for this paper six scenarios were specifically designed to assess the ability of nihm t to describe flow and transport processes scenarios s1 to s5 rely upon the domain configuration given in fig 1 that is purposely set up to simplify the various interpretations that will be given when comparing 3 d and 2 d integrated transport results the computational domain is a 100 m 20 m 10 m parallelepiped representing a synthetic unconfined aquifer the bottom and top elevations of the domain are set to 0 m and 10 m respectively for the comparison with traces 3 d model the whole domain is meshed via 56 000 hexahedron elements of uniform size 1 m over x and y directions along the vertical z direction the mesh is refined in the first meter close to the surface to improve numerical stability and provide accurate numerical solutions in the unsaturated infiltration area as a consequence the subsurface model is discretized into 28 horizontal layers of increasing thickness from 10 cm at the top to 50 cm at the bottom regarding the low dimensional 2 d model the grid composed of 4 000 triangular elements and 2 121 nodes is obtained by splitting in two the four edge horizontal facets of the first layer of the 3 d mesh for the btcs comparisons the element 2 d concentrations are the average of the two elements split from the 3 d grid to match the 3 d horizontal grid and the element 3 d concentrations are the depth averaged concentrations over the 28 layers flow and transport scenarios s1 to s5 were carried out in a heterogeneous block of hydraulic conductivity the log10 hydraulic conductivities obey a spherical covariance function with a mean of 3 5 a variance of 1 0 conductivities expressed in m s 1 and a correlation length of 60 m and 15 m in the horizontal and vertical directions respectively fig 1 the field has been generated using a sequential gaussian method described in gslib geostatistical software library deutsch and journel 1997 all the other flow and transport parameters are considered uniform over space the porosity is set to ϕ 0 15 and the specific storage to ss 5 10 3 m 1 the parameters for the mualem van genuchten equations are set to α 1 m 1 and n 2 for the transport problem the longitudinal dispersivity coefficient is assigned α l 5 m the horizontal and vertical for 3 d transverse dispersivity coefficients are taken as α t 0 5 m and the molecular diffusion coefficient in the porous material is equal to 10 9 m2 s 1 for the 2 d domain the hydraulic conductivities are integrated over depth taking care to consider the different layer thicknesses for flow dirichlet boundary conditions are prescribed on two opposite faces at x 0 and x 100 m while the other lateral faces and the bottom of the domain are considered as null flux neumann boundaries dirichlet head values are adjusted according to the targeted hydrological situations fully saturated and partially saturated described below using the above mentioned properties different initial and boundary conditions for the flow and transport problems were defined in scenarios s1 to s5 under transient flow conditions as summarized in table 1 for the first scenario s1 the domain is fully saturated the initial hydraulic head is set at 10 m and constant hydraulic heads are set to 12 m and 10 m at the dirichlet boundaries in x 0 m and x 100 m respectively fig 2 for the second scenario s2 the domain is partially saturated with an initial water table located 3 m below the soil surface the dirichlet boundaries in 0 m and x 100 m are set to h1 8 m and h2 7 m respectively as shown in fig 3 a uniform rainfall of 2 10 7 m s 1 is applied during the first 5 days at the surface of the domain the third scenario s3 is close to the second one but the initial water table and dirichlet boundary conditions are chosen to increase the unsaturated thickness and assess the effect of the hydrostatic pressure assumption for flow on the simulated transport the initial hydraulic head is thus set to 5 m the constant hydraulic head h1 6 m is imposed at x 0 m and h2 5 m is prescribed at 100 m see fig 3 for solute transport in the three configurations s1 s2 and s3 the initial concentration is equal to 0 except in a vertical column crossing the whole aquifer thickness and rectangular horizontal section extending within x 26 32 m and y 8 13 m fig 2 and fig 3 at this location the solute is injected through a source term evenly distributed over the 10 m depth of the system the injected mass is set to 6 10 3 kg s 1 for a duration of 3 days all boundaries are set to zero solute dispersion flux as contaminants can also reach groundwater from inlets at the land surface additional scenarios s4 and s5 only valid for the 3 d problem limit the contaminant injection to a surface area also located within x 26 32 m y 8 13 m but only over a thickness of 10 cm from the top of the domain as shown in fig 4 in 2 d s4 and s5 come down to an injection over the whole thickness of the system as 2 d simulations do not distinguish the surface from the depth the flow problem in scenarios s4 and s5 is very similar to that of scenario s2 but for s4 to diminish the thickness of the unsaturated zone the initial hydraulic head is set to 9 m and constant hydraulic heads h1 10 m and h2 9 m are imposed at x 0 m and at x 100 m respectively see fig 4 the simulated period is 16 days and a maximum time step length of 1 hr is prescribed for both the flow and transport simulations scenario 6 s6 is designed to assess the quality of the modeling approach in a more complex configuration with a tilted and bumpy bottom of the aquifer and more variable hydrological conditions the domain consists of two triangular hillslopes connected to a 140 m long and 6 m wide channel presented in fig 5 the surface slopes in the x and y direction are of 0 05 and 0 02 respectively the substratum bottom elevation of the aquifer is first defined by supposing it parallel to the surface with a thickness of the subsurface domain set to 20 m then the elevation of the substratum for each computation node is modified to render a bumped surface adding a perturbation randomly sampled with a 1 m uniform distribution for the traces 3 d model the whole system is meshed using 123 368 hexahedron elements of uniform size 2 m over x and y directions the domain is discretized into 45 layers of increasing thickness along the vertical z direction the computational mesh is refined close to the surface to better capture the infiltration dynamics for sake of consistency the integration in the flow model is performed using similar integration steps to evaluate the equivalent 2 d parameters the mesh grid in nihm t is composed of 3 220 triangular elements generated as for the preceding applications by splitting in two the horizontal 2 d elements of the top layer of the 3 d mesh the saturated hydraulic conductivity field is generated using the same technique as the one for the previous scenarios with an anisotropic spherical covariance of 60 m correlation length in the horizontal directions and of 15 m in the vertical direction the resulting statistical distribution of the log10 of conductivity values is gaussian of mean 4 56 and spans the range 6 25 2 95 the heterogeneous conductivity field was first generated into a parallelepiped as shown in fig 6 and then interpolated onto the computational meshes used for both nihm t and traces the van genuchten parameters α and n in the relationships between saturation water content and hydraulic conductivity are set to 1 m 1 and 2 respectively the lateral boundaries of the domain are considered as no flow boundaries hydraulic heads of 19 m and 24 8 m are imposed to the downhill and top limits of the domain respectively the initial conditions are set using a linear interpolation between the boundary conditions at the down and top limits the total time of simulation is 800 days rainfall is applied at the surface of the domain with a 2 10 7 m s 1 rate for 20 days every 60 days thus resulting in transient flow conditions over the whole simulation period for transport a source term of 1 6 10 4 kg s 1 is imposed in the computational meshes located at the surface and presented in orange in fig 5 for a duration of 300 days in the transport problem the longitudinal dispersivity coefficient is assigned α l 5 m the horizontal and vertical for 3 d transverse dispersivity coefficients are taken as α t 0 5 m and the molecular diffusion coefficient in the porous material is equal to 10 9 m2 s 1 the evolutions over time of average concentrations and statistical moments are compared between nihm t and traces 3d at points 3 and 4 posted in fig 5 4 results and discussion figure 7 shows the evolution over time of the average concentrations in scenario s1 at two selected points p1 x 50 m y 10 m and p2 x 70 m y 13 m displayed in fig 2 the evolution of the first order and second order moments for the first scenario s1 are shown in fig 8 the results produced by the low dimensional approach and traces 3 d are very close with a maximum root mean square error rmse for average concentrations of only 5 56 10 3 kg m 3 the btcs and the evolution of the zeroth first and second order moments demonstrate that in fully saturated conditions the low dimensional model can accurately reproduce the spatial evolution of the plume and the transport processes in a heterogeneous saturated hydraulic conductivity field this feature was expected in the absence of an unsaturated zone a specific case in which the averaging integration technique is reliable for both flow and transport in heterogeneous porous media the pairs fig 9 fig 10 and fig 11 fig 12 display the evolutions of the same variables that is btcs in p1 and p2 and spatial moments for scenarios s2 and s3 respectively in both cases the shapes of the btcs are similar but with a maximum value of concentrations higher for the 2 d approach and a maximum rmse of 8 21 10 2 kg m 3 for average concentrations when the thickness of the unsaturated zone is the highest s3 fig 11 the zeroth order moments show that the solute plumes reach the downstream boundary after 3 days just when the solute injection has stopped irrespective of the simulation s2 or s3 and the 2 d versus 3 d approaches the first order moments are close at the beginning of the simulation and become higher for the 2 d model this observation goes with the fact that the 3 d simulation with an explicit representation of the vadose zone might trap solute mass in low velocity areas of the shallow subsurface the mean location of the solute plume in 2 d moves slightly quicker and also goes slightly farther downstream than in 3 d in relation with the eventual trapping of solute in the vadose zone of the 3 d model the second order moments associated with the spreading of concentration over space are slightly higher for the full model these differences between models increase with the thickness of the unsaturated zone compare fig 9 with fig 11 and fig 10 with fig 12 and could be the consequence of the simplifications in the 2 d model where the unsaturated zone is described by hydrostatic heads only the mean velocities along the z direction could not fully coincide with the mean sampled by the 3 d model the recharge in s2 and s3 also generates vertical velocities which cannot be properly taken into account in the integrated model as we already mentioned by stating that infiltration is only seen in nihm as a variation of hydraulic heads this is confirmed by the snapshots presented in fig 13 and fig 14 for very similar shapes of the 2 d solute plume between scenarios s2 and s3 the vertical cross sections of the 3 d model clearly indicate that a thicker vadose zone increases the solute mass trapped just beneath the surface as told earlier in the fully 3 d simulations solute remains trapped in the unsaturated zone where velocities are very low compared to the saturated zone this trapping decreases the concentration peaks reduces the average velocity sampled by the solute and increases the dispersion of the contaminant in the 3 d configurations when the solute is only injected at the top surface of the domain the reduced model can underestimate the contaminant storage in the unsaturated zone for the fourth scenario s4 where the vadose zone is thin approximately one meter over the whole system the results in fig 15 and fig 16 clearly indicate that the low dimensional model reproduces fairly well the 3 d model results with a maximum rmse of 5 51 10 2 k g m 3 for average concentrations fig 15 when the unsaturated zone is thicker s5 its effects on solute transport are amplified compared to those seen for the column type concentration source the solute which was initially only concentrated in the upper part of the unsaturated zone remains trapped in areas of weak velocities only a little mass experiences the higher velocities of the saturated zone beneath therefore the overall transport is retarded renders lower solute peak values figs 17 and 18 and increased spreading fig 18 this is confirmed by the evolution of the zeroth order moments which illustrate a faster reduction in contaminant mass from day three in the reduced model the results presented in fig 19 and fig 20 for scenario s6 whose geometrical and hydrological conditions are more complex show the same overall trend for both average concentration and statistical moments evolutions as the unsaturated zone is deeper at point 3 than at point 4 due to the initial conditions the difference between the average concentrations produced by nihm t and traces 3 d is more pronounced at point 3 at both locations the reduced model performs well and is able to capture the transport dynamics the evolution over time of the zeroth first and second order moments plot in fig 20 also show that nihm t captures the spatial evolution of the plume even if the geometrical configuration of the domain and the history of flow and transport are more complex regarding the computational cost cpu times are recorded and compared for each model both models nihm t and traces 3 d are calculated on a standard desktop computer and the calculation time is related to the simulation period scenarios s1 to s5 16 days scenario s6 800 days the gain in computation time using the integrated model nihm is notable when reproducing subsurface flow and solute transport table 2 lists cpu times by distinguishing them between solving flow or transport as expected the low dimensional approach significantly reduces cpu times this is linked to the number of unknowns scenarios s1 to s5 12 240 in 2 d and 346 720 in 3 d scenario s6 9 886 in 2 d and 768 912 in 3 d and non linear flow conditions in the unsaturated zone we recall here that flow in the unsaturated zone is solved explicitly in 3 d and described by hydrostatic conditions in the low dimensional model 5 conclusions a low dimensional model has been proposed to describe the non reactive transport behavior of contaminants in the subsurface this investigation shows that the advection dispersion equation can be expressed with a reduced dimensionality by relying upon the low dimensional hydrological model nihm which calculates averaged water fluxes considering both the unsaturated and saturated zones of a shallow subsurface system the proposed approach has been tested on different heterogeneous synthetic test cases via a comparison with a full 3 d approach for both flow and transport the results indicate that the reduced model nihm t for both coupled flow and transport performs well under saturated flow conditions even in heterogeneous systems when applied to partially saturated heterogeneous aquifers the presence of a vadose zone can add further complexity because of the non negligible three directional components of water fluxes and their variations over time and space in the subsurface as the low dimensional model neglects the vertical components of flow assuming hydrostatic conditions the resulting mean water velocity fields can be partially flawed the main impact on transport comes from the relative thickness of the unsaturated zone compared with that of the saturated zone in the 2 d approach with flow integrated normal to bedrock the hydrostatic assumption needed for building an averaged 2 d field of mean velocities may overlook the variability of hydraulic conductivities due to variable saturations the direct result is a raw evaluation of water velocities in the system which directly impacts solute transport the 3 d configurations with sources of concentrations uniformly distributed over the whole thickness of the system can be correctly reproduced by a 2 d calculation simply because an injection at the surface in 2 d is equivalent to a uniform injection over depth in 3 d for the 3 d problems where the injection plug is limited to the first top layers of the domain the 3 d calculations will account for variable injection conditions over depth according to infiltration and vertical flow components for its part the 2 d approach will still consider that the concentration at the injection plug is uniform over depth in such applications the results reveal that the approximations associated with the integration of flow in 2 d nihm increase discrepancies between 2 d and 3 d as the thickness of the unsaturated zone increases and infiltration and time varying vertical water velocities become key features of the hydrological system however and notwithstanding its basic assumptions the reduced model is found to be practical for simulating solute transport in porous media for shallow aquifers in addition to simplifying mass transfer modeling it is worth mentioning that the cpu time required for the reduced model is significantly less compared to a full 3 d calculation overall in this study the low dimensional model is highlighted as an alternative for simulating water quality with this aim in mind further works would couple surface and subsurface solute transport processes to investigate actual complex watersheds and their questions relative to water quality challenges credit authorship contribution statement mouna chaguer methodology software validation writing original draft sylvain weill
