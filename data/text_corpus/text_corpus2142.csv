of crop and soil sciences washington state university pullman wa 99164 usa department of crop and soil sciences washington state university pullman wa 99164 usa direct root zone irrigation is a novel subsurface drip irrigation strategy for water conservation however a comparison with traditional irrigation methods is lacking to better define the potential advantages of direct root zone irrigation a two year study was conducted to evaluate the performance of vitis vinifera l cv cabernet sauvignon under direct root zone irrigation and surface drip irrigation in a commercial vineyard with loamy sand soil in a semi arid region of southcentral washington state usa plant water status root traits grape yield berry morphology and composition and crop water use efficiency were compared between irrigation methods under three irrigation rates compared to surface drip irrigation direct root zone irrigation improved grape yield by 9 12 and crop water use efficiency by 9 11 under varied climate conditions with minor effects on berry composition which could be potentially adjusted by irrigation rate moreover grapevines irrigated through direct root zone irrigation had 48 67 and 50 54 decrease in root number respectively at high and moderate irrigation rates in the upper soil profile 0 60 cm with a decrease in water stress as revealed by higher midday stem water potential irrigation rate was the major factor influencing berry morphology in fact reduced irrigation resulted in a decrease in weight size and number of berries we conclude that direct root zone irrigation could be a successful tool for improving yield and crop water use efficiency potentially encouraging deep rooting to alleviate the water stress in grapevine under seasonal drought and offering the ability to modify berry morphology and composition by adjusting the amount of water use keywords micro irrigation deficit irrigation grape physiology fruit quality perennial crops minirhizotron 1 introduction in recent years irrigation has expanded rapidly both in the new world e g the united states china and australia and the old world e g france portugal and spain wine regions due to prolonged drought and water scarcity during the growing season costa et al 2016 dry et al 2001 hou et al 2019 keller et al 2016 savi et al 2018 improving the design of irrigation systems and adopting more efficient irrigation methods are needed in the face of increasing water demands and global water shortages to guarantee global grape production and sustainable viticulture fader et al 2016 fraga et al 2018 ma et al 2019 malek et al 2018 medrano et al 2015 washington state ranks second as the largest premium wine producer in the united states behind california and vitis vinifera l cv cabernet sauvignon has been the top produced variety since 2015 washington state wine commission usa 2018 currently washington state has 14 american viticultural areas washington state wine commission usa 2019a b most of which are located on the eastern side of the cascade mountains where a semi arid climate prevails elsner et al 2010 the rain shadow of the cascade mountains limits summer rainfall making irrigation an essential prerequisite to washington viticulture washington state wine commission usa 2019a b traditional irrigation methods with surface applications may involve lower infrastructural costs as well as easy installation and maintenance e g furrow sprinkler irrigation these irrigation methods encourage water loss through soil water evaporation and percolation which lowers water use efficiency a critical issue in arid regions li and zhang 2017 the amount of water evaporation can potentially be reduced through improved irrigation techniques batchelor et al 1996 with a relative higher initial cost micro irrigation a low pressure low flow rate type of irrigation technique is water efficient by reducing the use of water resources and increasing yields and economic returns of woody perennial crops marino et al 2018 meshram et al 2019 morgan et al 2010 drip irrigation has become the most widespread micro irrigation method used in vineyards providing high uniformity of water distribution and capacity to deliver pressurized water to crops with controlled timing jensen et al 2014 among different types of drip irrigation surface drip irrigation sd is widely adopted due to its easier installation and maintenance however evaporation from the soil surface decreases crop water use efficiency wuec yield per unit area per unit of applied water and it favors weed growth around drip sites resulting in competition with major crops levidow et al 2014 subsurface drip irrigation sdi which delivers the water below the soil surface can potentially reduce those issues and has shown promise for grape yield and water use efficiency ma et al 2019 pisciotta et al 2018 sdi has received wider acceptance for perennial crops with upgraded irrigation equipment and irrigation scheduling tools especially when combined with the benefits of deficit irrigation practices ayars et al 2015 geerts and raes 2009 sdi is also a proven water efficient tool for production of other crops such as grains lamm and trooien 2003 murley et al 2018 vegetable crops batchelor et al 1996 bhattarai et al 2008 forage crops zaccaria et al 2017 and orchard trees zhang et al 2017 however additional improvements in sdi system design and water management are vital to conquer the current disadvantages and maximize water productivity ayars et al 2015 ma et al 2019 for example traditional sdi systems use buried drip lines which are difficult to monitor repair and adjust to meet needs based on the type and age of perennial crops lamm et al 2012 payero et al 2005 moreover these systems tend to concentrate the wetting zone possibly restricting root distribution of woody perennial crops and weakening structural support due to smaller wetting patterns lamm et al 2007 ma et al 2019 more studies are needed to investigate the influence of sdi on grapevine root development ayars et al 2015 due to the importance of roots in water and nutrient acquisition clothier and green 1997 understanding the pattern of root growth under regulated irrigation is essential to evaluate the performance of the technique and optimize grapevine growth ma et al 2019 tomasi et al 2015 previous studies have tried to improve sdi by changing the system design and installation barth 1999 the distance between the drip line and crops pisciotta et al 2018 dripline burial depth mo et al 2017 and adjusting planting and farming methods mo et al 2017 however these studies still used buried drip lines and more in depth investigations are required for comparison of surface and subsurface drip irrigation on v vinifera pisciotta et al 2018 to help enhance sdi system design and address the aforementioned issues we recently introduced a novel subsurface irrigation system termed direct root zone irrigation drz which has the potential to improve wuec and sustain grape yield and quality in semi arid climates ma et al 2019 drz offers a flexible way to adjust irrigation rate and water delivery depth by delivering the water directly to the functional root zones of grapevine through vertical pvc tubes the objective of this study was to compare the efficiencies of drz to sd in a commercial vineyard with loamy sand soil in a semi arid region of southcentral washington through the observations of 1 midday stem water potential 2 root distribution within 0 60 cm soil profile 3 grape yield 4 berry morphology and composition and 5 crop water use efficiency we hypothesized that grapevines under drz have higher yield and crop water use efficiency with lower water stress and fewer roots within the shallow soil profile we specifically emphasized the effects of these two irrigation methods on grape production and grapevine physiology 2 materials and methods 2 1 field site description and irrigation systems this study was conducted in two consecutive growing seasons 2017 2018 in a commercial vineyard of ten year old own rooted cabernet sauvignon vines in the red mountain american viticultural area ava near benton city washington 46 16 59 n 119 26 33 w 228 m a s l the orientation of vineyard rows is north to south with a spacing of 1 8 m between vines and 2 5 m between rows three wire trellis was implemented with vertical distances of 100 cm 140 cm and 180 cm between the soil surface and each wire soil on our experimental site is of the aridisol order and classified as a hezel loamy fine sand soil texture along the 0 40 cm soil profile is 80 sand 17 silt and 3 clay usda nrcs web soil survey 2018 with 0 56 total carbon and 0 056 total nitrogen based on soil chemical analysis weather data shown in fig 1 were recorded through an automated weather station operated by the washington agweathernet statewide system agweathernet at washington state university 2019 located approximately 1 km from the study site the commercial sd system with surface drip lines was installed at the time of vineyard establishment and all grapevines within our experimental site were drip irrigated before the treatments started in 2015 another surface drip line was established in each experimental row as part of tested drz and sd systems before the 2015 growing season and grapevines under drz had acclimated to the new irrigation strategy for two years 2015 2016 before conducting this two year study 2017 2018 the schematics and photographs of two irrigation systems are shown in supplemental fig 1 the vertical distances were 60 cm between the surface drip line and the soil surface and 40 cm between the drip line and bottom wire of the trellis for the drz system a 25 4 mm diameter hole was bored vertically to a depth of 60 cm approximately 40 cm on either side of the base of each vine trunk and beneath the trellis wire and suspended irrigation drip line a length of pvc tube schedule 40 20 mm inner diameter was inserted into each hole for water delivery with a 40 cm length above ground pvc tubes were previously cut to length to reach the desired depth and split once about 15 cm from the lower end to allow sufficient water passage into the soil we assumed that there was no effect from pvc on soil traits during our study a cap for each pvc tube was previously drilled to allow passage of feeder line with the length of 30 cm and the diameter of 6 35 mm which connects the surface drip line with a pressure compensating drip emitter ceta antelco longwood fl usa housed at the upper end of the pvc tube the cap was then secured over the upper end of the tube to prevent airborne dirt or debris from fouling the emitter the flow rate of each compensating emitter for both drz and sd methods was 2 l hour with two emitters for each vine providing each vine with a rate of 4 l hour of irrigation over the designated treatment amount 2 2 experimental design the experiment was established as a split plot design in a randomized complete block design with three blocks irrigation rate was designed as the first factor to whole plots forming a complete block based on evapotranspiration for grapevines etc eto kc the data of reference crop grass evapotranspiration eto were collected through an automated weather station operated by the washington agweathernet statewide system and were calculated using penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 the average crop coefficient for cabernet sauvignon kc 0 5 from bud break to harvest was developed in this study based on previous studies conducted in southcentral washington evans et al 1993 keller et al 2016 three levels of irrigation rate in our study were designated as high rate 0 75 0 80 etc moderate rate 0 60 0 65 etc and low rate 0 45 0 50 etc irrigation amounts and eto during different periods of phenological stages are shown in fig 2 irrigation method was applied as the second factor to sub plots within the whole plots within each block and only one irrigation method was assigned to each sub plot two irrigation methods were designated as sd and drz all treatments were replicated three times each treatment plot involved 3 contiguous rows with 5 vines in each row 3 rows 5 vines 15 vines per treatment plot measurements were taken on the three central vines from central rows in each of the treatment plots with twelve buffer vines alongside to avoid possible interference from neighboring treatments 2 3 irrigation scheduling irrigation was applied from bud break to postharvest and treatments were implemented from fruit set to harvest in each year fertigation was applied between bud break and fruit set in each year through surface drip lines to avoid an interaction effect between irrigation method and fertilization on grape production and root distribution which is not the intended focus of this study the irrigation interval 3 7 days was determined by the vineyard manager according to weather conditions soil water content and long standing guidelines used to meet commercial production goals in general vines were irrigated when soil water content reached below 4 1 mm 11 1 mm and 12 1 mm at 20 40 and 60 cm of soil depth respectively monitored by enviroscan probes sentek technologies australia installed in commercial plots within a distance of 20 m to the nearest boundary of our treatment plots in the same vineyard each irrigation set was delivered for 20 h encompassing the nighttime period water amounts were reduced to desired rates through battery powered controllers 11 000 l series galcon kfar blum israel and quantified by small mechanical water meters d l jerman co hackensack nj usa after harvest two more rounds of full irrigation 24 h of irrigation per event with a rate of 4 l h 1 vine 1 were applied to replenish soil moisture and help grapevines avoid frost damage later in winter and early spring of the following year after that no irrigation was applied until the bud break of the following growing season 2 4 phenology phenological stages of grapevine for all treatments were recorded based on the biologische bundesanstalt bundessortenamt und chemische industrie bbch scale for bud break stage 09 flowering stage 65 fruit set stage 71 veraison stage 81 and harvest stage 89 lorenz et al 1994 harvest dates were decided by technical staff of the commercial vineyard according to visual assessment of the fruit development and measurements on total soluble solids tss after 40 days of veraison generally grapes were harvested when berries were plump rich in color easily crushed without shrinkage and the values of tss remained the same between two consecutive measurements within a 3 4 day interval 2 5 midday stem water potential to compare the differences in water status of grapevines under different irrigation treatments the pressure bomb method was used for midday stem water potential ψstem md measurement scholander et al 1965 which has proven to be a robust and practical measurement of water stress and closely related to physiological responses at the leaf e g stomatal conductance and whole plant e g vegetative growth levels mccutchan and shackel 1992 shackel 2011 one leaf on the east side of each of three central vines in the middle row of each treatment plot was covered with a plastic bag inside an aluminum foil exterior envelope and allowed to equilibrate for an hour prior to sampling during the time of measurement a razor blade was used to sever the petiole of an encased leaf each time to detach it from the vine then quickly removed from the bag and inserted into a scholander pressure chamber 3000 series soil moisture equipment corp santa barbara ca usa leaf samples were pressurized with nitrogen gas to the point of sap movement from the cut petiole pressures were measured in bars then converted to mega pascals measurements were taken at fruit set pre veraison post veraison and harvest prior to each irrigation event and four times in total for each year 2 6 in situ root observation within each block one of three central vines in the middle row of each treatment plot irrigation rate irrigation method was selected for in situ root imaging comprising three replicates of vines in each treatment for analyses of root number and root length density rld defined as the root length per unit of root image area transparent acrylic tubes 80 cm long 6 35 cm inner diameter were installed at a distance of 30 cm with an angle of 15 to the vine truck which allowed observation of roots within a 0 60 cm soil profile the exposed top 8 10 cm of the root tubes was covered with aluminum tape and sealed with rubber caps to avoid disturbance from light on root growth and to prevent light scattering and interference for imaging three root images were taken at a dpi dots per inch of 300 along the length of each tube using the ci 600 in situ root imager cid bio science camas wa usa operated by a tablet computer with ci 600 software installed https cid inc com support ci 600 software the size of each root image was 21 5 cm long and 19 6 cm wide with approximately 0 8 cm overlap of adjacent images to guarantee the scan of entire root area of interest root images were analyzed individually by using rootsnap image analysis software version 1 3 2 25 cid bio science camas wa usa which was installed on a computer with a multi touch lcd screen allowing tactile root tracing details in operation of the root imager and root image analysis were described by ma et al 2019 root images were taken at each of two periods of phenological stages in each year flowering to fruit set before treatment started and veraison to harvest before treatment ended net increases in total root number and rld from the first to the second measurements within each year were calculated and compared for grapevines under different irrigation methods at each irrigation rate 2 7 grape yield quality and berry morphology grape harvest took place at 61 days and 56 days after veraison in 2017 and 2018 respectively depending on the criteria described in 2 4 at harvest vines were harvested individually by hand and grapes were weighed on site with a digital scale within each treatment plot 2 3 clusters of grapes from each of three central vines in the middle row were randomly selected and delivered immediately to a commercial laboratory ets laboratories walla walla wa usa for quality analyses titratable acidity and tss brix were determined on a fourier transformed mid infrared analyzer using an iso 17025 accredited technique ph was measured according to the aoac international oma 960 19 method aoac 2005 tannin and anthocyanins were extracted using a proprietary wine like extract briefly grapes were lightly macerated no broken seeds 15 ethanol was added and the mixture heated to extract wine like levels of tannin analysis of grape extracts was performed using an agilent 1290 hplc with the method described by waterhouse et al 1999 tannin is reported as catechin equivalents and anthocyanins as malvin equivalents in addition to grape sample collections at harvest for quality analysis another 2 3 clusters of grapes from each vine were randomly selected and pooled resulting in three observational samples per treatment plot and were brought back to the lab for berry morphological analysis all berries were manually separated from clusters and counted for number of berries per cluster then all single berries were weighed by a digital scale for calculation of single berry weight for measurements of berry diameter 10 berries were randomly selected from each pooled sample and measured individually by a digital caliper 2 8 crop water use efficiency grape yield and total water use amount within the active growth period in each year were recorded to quantify crop water use efficiency wuec wuec was calculated as wuec grape yield per ha total water use amount in kg ha 1 mm 1 irrigation plus rainfall from bud break to harvest 2 9 statistical analyses data were analyzed separately by year a two way analysis of variance anova was implemented to compare treatment effects comparisons between different treatment groups were performed with tukey s hsd test at p value 0 05 statistical analyses were run by using r 3 4 3 statistical software package www r project org correlation analysis was performed to correlate the relationship between root number and rld linear equations and correlation coefficients were calculated with sigmaplot 12 5 software package spss inc chicago il usa 3 results 3 1 weather data different weather patterns were found between the two years of the study fig 1 total precipitation was 48 higher in 2017 222 5 mm than in 2018 150 1 mm compared to the 50 year average precipitation total precipitation was 36 higher in 2017 and 8 lower in 2018 cumulative precipitation before bud break and between bud break and fruit set were 72 and 176 higher respectively in 2017 than in 2018 supplemental table 1 however precipitation was similar after harvest 0 5 mm different and it was extremely limited from fruit set to harvest in both years supplemental table 1 annual temperature was 1 2 c lower in 2017 as compared to 2018 and it was 0 3 c lower compared to the 50 year average temperature average temperature before bud break was 2 c lower in 2017 than in 2018 however average temperatures around bud break 14 days prior to bud break were similar between years 12 2 c and 12 3 c in 2017 and 2018 respectively between the stages of bud break and flowering average temperature was 1 4 c lower in 2017 than in 2018 the annual eto was lower in 2017 1064 8 mm than in 2018 1155 5 mm however accumulated eto from bud break to harvest were similar between years fig 2d h 3 2 phenology days of the year doy for each phenological stage were reported as the average of all treatments in order to map the development of vines and compare the differences in dates of identical phenological stages between years supplemental table 1 doy for bud break were similar between years however the flowering stage occurred 15 days later in 2017 compared to 2018 and the delays 10 17 days later of doy for the following phenological stages fruit set veraison harvest were maintained until the end of the growing season the number of days from bud break to harvest was longer in 2017 168 days than in 2018 154 days 3 3 midday stem water potential overall ψstem md decreased with the extension of deficit irrigation with more negative readings occurring in the latter part of the growing season as determined by changes in water status of grapevines under different irrigation rates and methods fig 3 no statistically significant differences in ψstem md were found at fruit set the phenological stage when treatments were started in both years significant treatment effects were revealed after fruit set and both irrigation rate and method influenced ψstem md with no interaction effect found in both years table 1 significant effects on ψstem md from irrigation rate occurred earlier at pre veraison than from irrigation method at post veraison ψstem md was generally decreased with the decrease of irrigation rate with 4 12 and 13 39 declines at moderate and low irrigation rates respectively compared to the high irrigation rates after fruit set grapevines irrigated using the drz method showed significantly 10 14 higher ψstem md compared to grapevines irrigated with the sd method after veraison in both years 3 4 root observations within each year of our study no significant differences in total root number and rld were found in measurements taken between flowering and fruit set before treatments began table 2 at the period from veraison to harvest significant interactions between irrigation rate and method were found on total root number along the 0 60 cm soil profile in both years table 2 and the effects of different irrigation methods depended upon the levels of irrigation rate fig 4 during the period from veraison to harvest in each year significant differences in total root number existed between grapevines under different irrigation methods at high irrigation rates with 67 and 48 decreased total root number under drz respectively in 2017 and 2018 compared to sd likewise 50 and 54 decreased total root number was found in grapevines under drz at the moderate irrigation rate respectively in 2017 and 2018 although the decline was not statistically significant in the first year however no significant differences in total root number were found between the two irrigation methods at low irrigation rate in both years fig 4b d comparing irrigation rates using the sd method total root number significantly decreased 51 60 from high to low irrigation rates however no significant differences in total root number were found across all irrigation rates within the drz method in each year fig 4b d net increases in total root number between the two measurements within each year were approximately 2 5 times greater at high irrigation rate 1 3 times greater at moderate irrigation rate and 2 4 times greater at low irrigation rate for grapevines under the sd method compared to the drz method a strong positive correlation was found between total root number and rld in each year fig 5 and the mean value of rld averaged across all treatments within each year was higher under sd than under drz however rld showed no statistical differences in 0 60 cm upper soil profile between grapevines under different irrigation rates and methods in both years table 2 regarding the measurements taken between veraison and harvest significantly lower root number and rld were found in grapevines irrigated at high and moderate rates through drz within certain ranges of soil depth 20 cm interval along 0 60 cm in both years figs 6 7 compared to sd grapevines irrigated at the high irrigation rate through drz had 60 71 49 70 and 36 58 decreased root number respectively at 0 20 cm 20 40 cm and 40 60 cm soil depths across both years fig 6b d although no significant difference in root number between the two irrigation methods was found at the moderate rate in 2017 75 and 49 lower root number were found respectively at 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm soil depths in 2018 fig 6f h significantly lower rld in grapevines irrigated through drz were found within the 0 20 cm soil depth in both years at the high rate 65 and 59 decreases fig 7b d and in the second year at the moderate irrigation rate 62 decrease fig 7h no significant differences in root number and rld were found at the low irrigation rate in both years 3 5 grape yield quality and berry morphology grape yields under different irrigation rates and methods were compared at harvest table 3 irrigation method showed significant effects on grape yield in both years with approximately 9 and 12 increased yields in grapevines under drz compared to sd in 2017 and 2018 across all irrigation rates mean values of yield declined with decreased irrigation rate however no statistically significant effects were found from irrigation rate and the interaction between irrigation rate and method on yield in our study both irrigation rate and method showed no significant effects on titratable acidity ph and tannin contents in both years table 4 although mean values of tss were relative lower for grapes irrigated by drz compared to sd in both years a significant difference was found only in the first year 0 9 brix different and irrigation rate had no significant effect on tss a significant increase in total anthocyanins was only found in grapes under the low irrigation rate in 2018 with a 23 increase compared to moderate rate and no significant differences were found between other rates and irrigation methods in both years overall no interaction effects were found on quality parameters in our study in contrast decreased irrigation rate significantly reduced the single berry weight and diameter of berries in both years as the low rate resulted in a 10 11 decrease in single berry weight and a 6 20 decrease in diameter of berries compared to the high rate table 4 there was no effect of the two irrigation methods on single berry weight or diameter however both irrigation rate and method significantly influenced number of berries per cluster in the second year with 48 and 38 decrease in number of berries at the low rate compared to high and moderate rates respectively and 21 higher number of berries was found using drz in comparison to sd no interaction effect between irrigation rate and method was found over the course of our study 3 6 crop water use efficiency wuec in grapevine was significantly affected both by irrigation rate and method across the two years of study table 3 decreases in irrigation rate from high to moderate and from high to low resulted in 14 19 and 42 56 increased wuec respectively drz improved wuec of grapevine by 9 11 compared to sd no interaction effect between irrigation rate and method was found on wuec during this study 4 discussion this two year study found improvements in grape yield and wuec using direct root zone irrigation drz compared to traditional surface drip irrigation sd in a commercial vineyard with loamy sand soil in a semi arid climate of washington state with the advantages provided by traditional sdi howell et al 1997 drz potentially reduces soil water evaporation and restricts the available water for weed growth in shallow soil juárez escario et al 2017 by irrigating grapevines at a deeper soil depth e g 60 cm in our study which possibly provides more water for grapevines to increase yield and wuec notably a recent study showed no significant difference in delivery depth 30 60 or 90 cm using drz ma et al 2019 indicating that irrigation rate is the major factor for regulation of the yield and wuec in our focal area previous studies also show the advantages of sdi on yield and wuec of grape ma et al 2019 mirás avalos et al 2017 pisciotta et al 2018 and other woody perennial crops such as pomegranate zhang et al 2017 citrus martínez gimeno et al 2018 and poplar paris et al 2018 however soil texture affects the performance of irrigation systems due to its influence on soil water retention and distribution siyal and skaggs 2009 for example water quickly applied to the surface of fine textured soil e g clay soil is absorbed slowly and has a tendency to run off but the water could be retained longer compared to course textured soil therefore sdi could increase soil water content and perform better than sd in fine textured soil for higher yield and wuec al omran et al 2005 moreover a recent study reported that sdi can dilute the concentration of solutes in loam soil by reducing evaporation of irrigation water bern et al 2013 in contrast excessively localized sdi possibly causes water infiltration and salinization in course textured soil e g sandy soil which may hamper the development of subsurface irrigation strategies ayars et al 2015 lamm et al 2007 these pros and cons need to be carefully defined based on soil type through future studies during this study the variable weather conditions between years did not change the treatment effects on grape yield and wuec however it influenced grapevine phenology lower temperatures between bud break and flowering stages triggered delay of flowering in 2017 which was also reported in previous studies costa et al 2019 jones and davis 2000 parker et al 2011 van leeuwen and darriet 2016 lower annual temperature could be the reason for a longer period of active growth from bud break to harvest that was observed in 2017 according to a long term study of climatic impact on grapevine phenology tomasi et al 2011 bud break is highly sensitive to temperature tomasi et al 2011 however the significantly lower temperature in early 2017 did not delay the date of bud break which was probably due to the insignificant difference in temperature around bud break treatment effects on ψstem md were consistent between years cooler average temperature and significantly higher cumulative precipitation before fruit set in 2017 resulted in higher ψstem md before treatment started compared to 2018 grapevines irrigated through drz had significantly higher ψstem md at later growing stages which was probably due to reduced soil water evaporation therefore more available water to compensate for diurnal water stress ayars et al 2015 differences in treatment effects on ψstem md became more significant after veraison due to accumulated effects of deficit irrigation with increased temperature and extremely limited rainfall similar to the findings of a previous study fereres and soriano 2007 types of irrigation system and the frequency and duration of irrigation events influence plant rooting patterns ansley et al 2014 bassoi et al 2003 sharma et al 2018 which was also found in our study limited water availability restricts root growth farooq et al 2009 osmont et al 2007 which could be used to explain the insignificant difference in total root number between the two irrigation methods at the low irrigation rate decreased total root number and rld in the upper soil profile with higher ψstem md were found in grapevines irrigated through drz suggesting a deep root system might have developed below 60 cm which helped acquire groundwater to compensate for the water deficit bleby et al 2010 savi et al 2018 root development in grapevine shows a seasonal pattern with functional roots growing deeper into the soil profile for water uptake after fruit set karakis et al 2018 based on this pattern applying the drz method from fruit set to harvest could be an efficient irrigation strategy by delivering the water directly to the functional root zone to improve wuec plants not under water stress have more carbon and nitrogen resources for aboveground growth and production farooq et al 2009 shang et al 2019 which could be another reason for higher yield in grapevines under drz irrigation method showed no significant effect on most qualitative parameters of berries excepting the significantly lower brix in berries under drz in the first year lower annual temperature elongated the phenological period from bud break to harvest in 2017 which may help differentiate the effects of deficit irrigation through the two irrigation methods jones and davis 2000 lower brix in berries under drz was probably due to lower water stress in grapevine which significantly reduced accumulation of soluble sugars kuhn et al 2014 it indicates that higher brix could be achieved through the drz by using less water while sustaining grape yield compared to sd method which also improves wuec sharma and upadhyay 2011 reported that similar amounts of yield and tss were attained under sdi with 25 less irrigated water than sd contrasting results are reported in the literature regarding the qualitative responses of grapevines to sdi versus sd methods pisciotta et al 2018 found no significant influence of sdi on berry composition compared to sd however acevedo opazo et al 2010 reported significant differences in qualitative parameters among seasons and different water status in grapevines inconsistent results could be caused by differences in types of soil grape variety and climatic conditions water deficit significantly restricted berry weight and size in both years due to the important function of available water on berry cell division and expansion keller 2010 roby and matthews 2008 this study is an initial step to develop a more efficient sdi method for sustaining grape production and adapting to potential threats from global water shortages and unstable climatic patterns drz provides flexible ways to adjust irrigation rate and water delivery depth for optimizing water productivity and regulating berry development in semi arid regions a long term study needs to be conducted to evaluate the economic and environmental benefits of drz compared to traditional irrigation techniques under different scenarios for improving the design of the current drz system and to better define the optimum conditions for successful application of the drz method 5 conclusions this study demonstrated the advantages of direct root zone irrigation drz over the surface drip irrigation sd on grape yield 9 12 increase and crop water use efficiency 9 11 increase in loamy sand soil in a semi arid climate berry morphology and composition could potentially be controlled by regulating the irrigation rate reduced soil water evaporation and development of deep root system could be the reasons why grapevines irrigated through drz displayed lower diurnal water stress which needs to be tested in future studies also desirable conditions for utilization of drz should

10710,direct root zone irrigation outperforms surface drip irrigation for grape yield and crop water use efficiency while restricting root growth xiaochi ma karen a sanguinet pete w jacoby department of crop and soil sciences washington state university pullman wa 99164 usa department of crop and soil sciences washington state university pullman wa 99164 usa direct root zone irrigation is a novel subsurface drip irrigation strategy for water conservation however a comparison with traditional irrigation methods is lacking to better define the potential advantages of direct root zone irrigation a two year study was conducted to evaluate the performance of vitis vinifera l cv cabernet sauvignon under direct root zone irrigation and surface drip irrigation in a commercial vineyard with loamy sand soil in a semi arid region of southcentral washington state usa plant water status root traits grape yield berry morphology and composition and crop water use efficiency were compared between irrigation methods under three irrigation rates compared to surface drip irrigation direct root zone irrigation improved grape yield by 9 12 and crop water use efficiency by 9 11 under varied climate conditions with minor effects on berry composition which could be potentially adjusted by irrigation rate moreover grapevines irrigated through direct root zone irrigation had 48 67 and 50 54 decrease in root number respectively at high and moderate irrigation rates in the upper soil profile 0 60 cm with a decrease in water stress as revealed by higher midday stem water potential irrigation rate was the major factor influencing berry morphology in fact reduced irrigation resulted in a decrease in weight size and number of berries we conclude that direct root zone irrigation could be a successful tool for improving yield and crop water use efficiency potentially encouraging deep rooting to alleviate the water stress in grapevine under seasonal drought and offering the ability to modify berry morphology and composition by adjusting the amount of water use keywords micro irrigation deficit irrigation grape physiology fruit quality perennial crops minirhizotron 1 introduction in

water scarcity during the growing season costa et al 2016 dry et al 2001 hou et al 2019 keller et al 2016 savi et al 2018 improving the design of irrigation systems and adopting more efficient irrigation methods are needed in the face of increasing water demands and global water shortages to guarantee global grape production and sustainable viticulture fader et al 2016 fraga et al 2018 ma et al 2019 malek et al 2018 medrano et al 2015 washington state ranks second as the largest premium wine producer in the united states behind california and vitis vinifera l cv cabernet sauvignon has

essential prerequisite to washington viticulture washington state wine commission usa 2019a b traditional irrigation methods with surface applications may involve lower infrastructural costs as well as easy installation and maintenance e g furrow sprinkler irrigation these irrigation methods encourage water loss through soil water evaporation and percolation which lowers water use efficiency a critical issue in arid regions li and zhang 2017 the amount of water evaporation can potentially be reduced through improved irrigation techniques batchelor et al 1996 with a relative higher initial cost micro irrigation a low pressure low flow rate type of irrigation technique is water efficient by reducing the use of water resources and increasing yields and economic returns of woody perennial crops marino et al 2018 meshram et al 2019 morgan et al 2010 drip irrigation has become the most widespread micro irrigation method used in vineyards providing high uniformity of water distribution and capacity to deliver pressurized water to crops with controlled timing jensen et al 2014 among different types of drip irrigation surface drip irrigation sd is widely adopted due to its easier installation and maintenance however evaporation from the soil surface decreases crop water use efficiency wuec yield per unit area per unit of applied water and it favors weed growth around drip sites resulting in competition with major crops levidow et al 2014 subsurface drip irrigation sdi which delivers the water below the soil surface can potentially reduce those issues and has shown promise for grape yield and water use efficiency ma et al 2019 pisciotta et al 2018 sdi has received wider acceptance for perennial crops with upgraded irrigation equipment and irrigation scheduling tools especially when combined with the benefits of deficit irrigation practices ayars et al 2015 geerts and raes 2009 sdi is also a proven water efficient tool for production of other crops such as grains lamm and trooien 2003 murley et al 2018 vegetable crops batchelor et al 1996 bhattarai et al 2008 forage crops zaccaria et al 2017 and orchard trees zhang et al 2017 however additional improvements in sdi system design and water management are vital to conquer the current disadvantages and maximize water productivity ayars et al 2015 ma et al 2019 for example traditional sdi systems use buried drip lines which are difficult to monitor repair and adjust to meet needs based on the type and age of perennial crops lamm et al 2012 payero et al 2005 moreover these systems tend to concentrate the wetting zone possibly restricting root distribution of woody perennial crops and weakening structural support due to smaller wetting patterns lamm et al 2007 ma et al 2019 more studies are needed to investigate the influence of sdi on grapevine root development ayars et al 2015 due to the importance of roots in water and nutrient acquisition clothier and green 1997 understanding the pattern of root growth under regulated irrigation is essential to evaluate the performance of the technique and optimize grapevine growth ma et al 2019 tomasi et al 2015 previous studies have tried to improve sdi by changing the system design and installation barth 1999 the distance between the drip line and crops pisciotta et al 2018 dripline burial depth mo et al 2017 and adjusting planting and farming methods mo et al 2017 however these studies still used buried drip lines and more in depth investigations are required for comparison of surface and subsurface drip irrigation on v vinifera pisciotta et al 2018 to help enhance sdi system design and address the aforementioned issues we recently introduced a novel subsurface irrigation system termed direct root zone irrigation drz which has the potential to improve wuec and sustain grape yield and quality in semi arid climates ma et al 2019 drz offers a flexible way to adjust irrigation rate and water delivery depth by delivering the water directly to the functional root zones of grapevine through vertical pvc tubes the objective of this study was to compare the efficiencies of drz to sd in a commercial vineyard with loamy sand soil in a semi arid region of southcentral washington through the observations of 1 midday stem water potential 2 root distribution within 0 60 cm soil profile 3 grape yield 4 berry morphology and composition and 5 crop water use efficiency we hypothesized that grapevines under drz have higher yield and crop water use efficiency with lower water stress and fewer roots within the shallow soil profile we specifically emphasized the effects of these two irrigation methods on grape production and grapevine physiology 2 materials and methods 2 1 field site description and irrigation systems this study was conducted in two consecutive growing seasons 2017 2018 in a commercial vineyard of ten year old own rooted cabernet sauvignon vines in the red mountain american viticultural area ava near benton city washington 46 16 59 n 119 26 33 w 228 m a s l the orientation of vineyard rows is north to south with a spacing of 1 8 m between vines and 2 5 m between rows three wire trellis was implemented with vertical distances of 100 cm 140 cm and 180 cm between the soil surface and each wire soil on our experimental site is of the aridisol order and classified as a hezel loamy fine sand soil texture along the 0 40 cm soil profile is 80 sand 17 silt and 3 clay usda nrcs web soil survey 2018 with 0 56 total carbon and 0 056 total nitrogen based on soil chemical analysis weather data shown in fig 1 were recorded through an automated weather station operated by the washington agweathernet statewide system agweathernet at washington state university 2019 located approximately 1 km from the study site the commercial sd system with surface drip lines was installed at the time of vineyard establishment and all grapevines within our experimental site were drip irrigated before the treatments started in 2015 another surface drip line was established in each experimental row as part of tested drz and sd systems before the 2015 growing season and grapevines under drz had acclimated to the new irrigation strategy for two years 2015 2016 before conducting this two year study 2017 2018 the schematics and photographs of two irrigation systems are shown in supplemental fig 1 the vertical distances were 60 cm between the surface drip line and the soil surface and 40 cm between the drip line and bottom wire of the trellis for the drz system a 25 4 mm diameter hole was bored vertically to a depth of 60 cm approximately 40 cm on either side of the base of each vine trunk and beneath the trellis wire and suspended irrigation drip line a length of pvc tube schedule 40 20 mm inner diameter was inserted into each hole for water delivery with a 40 cm length above ground pvc tubes were previously cut to length to reach the desired depth and split once about 15 cm from the lower end to allow sufficient water passage into the soil we assumed that there was no effect from pvc on soil traits during our study a cap for each pvc tube was previously drilled to allow passage of feeder line with the length of 30 cm and the diameter of 6 35 mm which connects the surface drip line with a pressure compensating drip emitter ceta antelco longwood fl usa housed at the upper end of the pvc tube the cap was then secured over the upper end of the tube to prevent airborne dirt or debris from fouling the emitter the flow rate of each compensating emitter for both drz and sd methods was 2 l hour with two emitters for each vine providing each vine with a rate of 4 l hour of irrigation over the designated treatment amount 2 2 experimental design the experiment was established as a split plot design in a randomized complete block design with three blocks irrigation rate was designed as the first factor to whole plots forming a complete block based on evapotranspiration for grapevines etc eto kc the data of reference crop grass evapotranspiration eto were collected through an automated weather station operated by the washington agweathernet statewide system and were calculated using penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 the average crop coefficient for cabernet sauvignon kc 0 5 from bud break to harvest was developed in this study based on previous studies conducted in southcentral washington evans et al 1993 keller et al 2016 three levels of irrigation rate in our study were designated as high rate 0 75 0 80 etc moderate rate 0 60 0 65 etc and low rate 0 45 0 50 etc irrigation amounts and eto during different periods of phenological stages are shown in fig 2 irrigation method was applied as the second factor to sub plots within the whole plots within each block and only one irrigation method was assigned to each sub plot two irrigation methods were designated as sd and drz all treatments were replicated three times each treatment plot involved 3 contiguous rows with 5 vines in each row 3 rows 5 vines 15 vines per treatment plot measurements were taken on the three central vines from central rows in each of the treatment plots with twelve buffer vines alongside to avoid possible interference from neighboring treatments 2 3 irrigation scheduling irrigation was applied from bud break to postharvest and treatments were implemented from fruit set to harvest in each year fertigation was applied between bud break and fruit set in each year through surface drip lines to avoid an interaction effect between irrigation method and fertilization on grape production and root distribution which is not the intended focus of this study the irrigation interval 3 7 days was determined by the vineyard manager according to weather conditions soil water content and long standing guidelines used to meet commercial production goals in general vines were irrigated when soil water content reached below 4 1 mm 11 1 mm and 12 1 mm at 20 40 and 60 cm of soil depth respectively monitored by enviroscan probes sentek technologies australia installed in commercial plots within a distance of 20 m to the nearest boundary of our treatment plots in the same vineyard each irrigation set was delivered for 20 h encompassing the nighttime period water amounts were reduced to desired rates through battery powered controllers 11 000 l series galcon kfar blum israel and quantified by small mechanical water meters d l jerman co hackensack nj usa after harvest two more rounds of full irrigation 24 h of irrigation per event with a rate of 4 l h 1 vine 1 were applied to replenish soil moisture and help grapevines avoid frost damage later in winter and early spring of the following year after that no irrigation was applied until the bud break of the following growing season 2 4 phenology phenological stages of grapevine for all treatments were recorded based on the biologische bundesanstalt bundessortenamt und chemische industrie bbch scale for bud break stage 09 flowering stage 65 fruit set stage 71 veraison stage 81 and harvest stage 89 lorenz et al 1994 harvest dates were decided by technical staff of the commercial vineyard according to visual assessment of the fruit development and measurements on total soluble solids tss after 40 days of veraison generally grapes were harvested when berries were plump rich in color easily crushed without shrinkage and the values of tss remained the same between two consecutive measurements within a 3 4 day interval 2 5 midday stem water potential to compare the differences in water status of grapevines under different irrigation treatments the pressure bomb method was used for midday stem water potential ψstem md measurement scholander et al 1965 which has proven to be a robust and practical measurement of water stress and closely related to physiological responses at the leaf e g stomatal conductance and whole plant e g vegetative growth levels mccutchan and shackel 1992 shackel 2011 one leaf on the east side of each of three central vines in the middle row of each treatment plot was covered with a plastic bag inside an aluminum foil exterior envelope and allowed to equilibrate for an hour prior to sampling during the time of measurement a razor blade was used to sever the petiole of an encased leaf each time to detach it from the vine then quickly removed from the bag and inserted into a scholander pressure chamber 3000 series soil moisture equipment corp santa barbara ca usa leaf samples were pressurized with nitrogen gas to the point of sap movement from the cut petiole pressures were measured in bars then converted to mega pascals measurements were taken at fruit set pre veraison post veraison and harvest prior to each irrigation event and four times in total for each year 2 6 in situ root observation within each block one of three central vines in the middle row of each treatment plot irrigation rate irrigation method was selected for in situ root imaging comprising three replicates of vines in each treatment for analyses of root number and root length density rld defined as the root length per unit of root image area transparent acrylic tubes 80 cm long 6 35 cm inner diameter were installed at a distance of 30 cm with an angle of 15 to the vine truck which allowed observation of roots within a 0 60 cm soil profile the exposed top 8 10 cm of the root tubes was covered with aluminum tape and sealed with rubber caps to avoid disturbance from light on root growth and to prevent light scattering and interference for imaging three root images were taken at a dpi dots per inch of 300 along the length of each tube using the ci 600 in situ root imager cid bio science camas wa usa operated by a tablet computer with ci 600 software installed https cid inc com support ci 600 software the size of each root image was 21 5 cm long and 19 6 cm wide with approximately 0 8 cm overlap of adjacent images to guarantee the scan of entire root area of interest root images were analyzed individually by using rootsnap image analysis software version 1 3 2 25 cid bio science camas wa usa which was installed on a computer with a multi touch lcd screen allowing tactile root tracing details in operation of the root imager and root image analysis were described by ma et al 2019 root images were taken at each of two periods of phenological stages in each year flowering to fruit set before treatment started and veraison to harvest before treatment ended net increases in total root number and rld from the first to the second measurements within each year were calculated and compared for grapevines under different irrigation methods at each irrigation rate 2 7 grape yield quality and berry morphology grape harvest took place at 61 days and 56 days after veraison in 2017 and 2018 respectively depending on the criteria described in 2 4 at harvest vines were harvested individually by hand and grapes were weighed on site with a digital scale within each treatment plot 2 3 clusters of grapes from each of three central vines in the middle row were randomly selected and delivered immediately to a commercial laboratory ets laboratories walla walla wa usa for quality analyses titratable acidity and tss brix were determined on a fourier transformed mid infrared analyzer using an iso 17025 accredited technique ph was measured according to the aoac international oma 960 19 method aoac 2005 tannin and anthocyanins were extracted using a proprietary wine like extract briefly grapes were lightly macerated no broken seeds 15 ethanol was added and the mixture heated to extract wine like levels of tannin analysis of grape extracts was performed using an agilent 1290 hplc with the method described by waterhouse et al 1999 tannin is reported as catechin equivalents and anthocyanins as malvin equivalents in addition to grape sample collections at harvest for quality analysis another 2 3 clusters of grapes from each vine were randomly selected and pooled resulting in three observational samples per treatment plot and were brought back to the lab for berry morphological analysis all berries were manually separated from clusters and counted for number of berries per cluster then all single berries were weighed by a digital scale for calculation of single berry weight for measurements of berry diameter 10 berries were randomly selected from each pooled sample and measured individually by a digital caliper 2 8 crop water use efficiency grape yield and total water use amount within the active growth period in each year were recorded to quantify crop water use efficiency wuec wuec was calculated as wuec grape yield per ha total water use amount in kg ha 1 mm 1 irrigation plus rainfall from bud break to harvest 2 9 statistical analyses data were analyzed separately by year a two way analysis of variance anova was implemented to compare treatment effects comparisons between different treatment groups were performed with tukey s hsd test at p value 0 05 statistical analyses were run by using r 3 4 3 statistical software package www r project org correlation analysis was performed to correlate the relationship between root number and rld linear equations and correlation coefficients were calculated with sigmaplot 12 5 software package spss inc chicago il usa 3 results 3 1 weather data different weather patterns were found between the two years of the study fig 1 total precipitation was 48 higher in 2017 222 5 mm than in 2018 150 1 mm compared to the 50 year average precipitation total precipitation was 36 higher in 2017 and 8 lower in 2018 cumulative precipitation before bud break and between bud break and fruit set were 72 and 176 higher respectively in 2017 than in 2018 supplemental table 1 however precipitation was similar after harvest 0 5 mm different and it was extremely limited from fruit set to harvest in both years supplemental table 1 annual temperature was 1 2 c lower in 2017 as compared to 2018 and it was 0 3 c lower compared to the 50 year average temperature average temperature before bud break was 2 c lower in 2017 than in 2018 however average temperatures around bud break 14 days prior to bud break were similar between years 12 2 c and 12 3 c in 2017 and 2018 respectively between the stages of bud break and flowering average temperature was 1 4 c lower in 2017 than in 2018 the annual eto was lower in 2017 1064 8 mm than in 2018 1155 5 mm however accumulated eto from bud break to harvest were similar between years fig 2d h 3 2 phenology days of the year doy for each phenological stage were reported as the average of all treatments in order to map the development of vines and compare the differences in dates of identical phenological stages between years supplemental table 1 doy for bud break were similar between years however the flowering stage occurred 15 days later in 2017 compared to 2018 and the delays 10 17 days later of doy for the following phenological stages fruit set veraison harvest were maintained until the end of the growing season the number of days from bud break to harvest was longer in 2017 168 days than in 2018 154 days 3 3 midday stem water potential overall ψstem md decreased with the extension of deficit irrigation with more negative readings occurring in the latter part of the growing season as determined by changes in water status of grapevines under different irrigation rates and methods fig 3 no statistically significant differences in ψstem md were found at fruit set the phenological stage when treatments were started in both years significant treatment effects were revealed after fruit set and both irrigation rate and method influenced ψstem md with no interaction effect found in both years table 1 significant effects on ψstem md from irrigation rate occurred earlier at pre veraison than from irrigation method at post veraison ψstem md was generally decreased with the decrease of irrigation rate with 4 12 and 13 39 declines at moderate and low irrigation rates respectively compared to the high irrigation rates after fruit set grapevines irrigated using the drz method showed significantly 10 14 higher ψstem md compared to grapevines irrigated with the sd method after veraison in both years 3 4 root observations within each year of our study no significant differences in total root number and rld were found in measurements taken between flowering and fruit set before treatments began table 2 at the period from veraison to harvest significant interactions between irrigation rate and method were found on total root number along the 0 60 cm soil profile in both years table 2 and the effects of different irrigation methods depended upon the levels of irrigation rate fig 4 during the period from veraison to harvest in each year significant differences in total root number existed between grapevines under different irrigation methods at high irrigation rates with 67 and 48 decreased total root number under drz respectively in 2017 and 2018 compared to sd likewise 50 and 54 decreased total root number was found in grapevines under drz at the moderate irrigation rate respectively in 2017 and 2018 although the decline was not statistically significant in the first year however no significant differences in total root number were found between the two irrigation methods at low irrigation rate in both years fig 4b d comparing irrigation rates using the sd method total root number significantly decreased 51 60 from high to low irrigation rates however no significant differences in total root number were found across all irrigation rates within the drz method in each year fig 4b d net increases in total root number between the two measurements within each year were approximately 2 5 times greater at high irrigation rate 1 3 times greater at moderate irrigation rate and 2 4 times greater at low irrigation rate for grapevines under the sd method compared to the drz method a strong positive correlation was found between total root number and rld in each year fig 5 and the mean value of rld averaged across all treatments within each year was higher under sd than under drz however rld showed no statistical differences in 0 60 cm upper soil profile between grapevines under different irrigation rates and methods in both years table 2 regarding the measurements taken between veraison and harvest significantly lower root number and rld were found in grapevines irrigated at high and moderate rates through drz within certain ranges of soil depth 20 cm interval along 0 60 cm in both years figs 6 7 compared to sd grapevines irrigated at the high irrigation rate through drz had 60 71 49 70 and 36 58 decreased root number respectively at 0 20 cm 20 40 cm and 40 60 cm soil depths across both years fig 6b d although no significant difference in root number between the two irrigation methods was found at the moderate rate in 2017 75 and 49 lower root number were found respectively at 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm soil depths in 2018 fig 6f h significantly lower rld in grapevines irrigated through drz were found within the 0 20 cm soil depth in both years at the high rate 65 and 59 decreases fig 7b d and in the second year at the moderate irrigation rate 62 decrease fig 7h no significant differences in root number and rld were found at the low irrigation rate in both years 3 5 grape yield quality and berry morphology grape yields under different irrigation rates and methods were compared at harvest table 3 irrigation method showed significant effects on grape yield in both years with approximately 9 and 12 increased yields in grapevines under drz compared to sd in 2017 and 2018 across all irrigation rates mean values of yield declined with decreased irrigation rate however no statistically significant effects were found from irrigation rate and the interaction between irrigation rate and method on yield in our study both irrigation rate and method showed no significant effects on titratable acidity ph and tannin contents in both years table 4 although mean values of tss were relative lower for grapes irrigated by drz compared to sd in both years a significant difference was found only in the first year 0 9 brix different and irrigation rate had no significant effect on tss a significant increase in total anthocyanins was only found in grapes under the low irrigation rate in 2018 with a 23 increase compared to moderate rate and no significant differences were found between other rates and irrigation methods in both years overall no interaction effects were found on quality parameters in our study in contrast decreased irrigation rate significantly reduced the single berry weight and diameter of berries in both years as the low rate resulted in a 10 11 decrease in single berry weight and a 6 20 decrease in diameter of berries compared to the high rate table 4 there was no effect of the two irrigation methods on single berry weight or diameter however both irrigation rate and method significantly influenced number of berries per cluster in the second year with 48 and 38 decrease in number of berries at the low rate compared to high and moderate rates respectively and 21 higher number of berries was found using drz in comparison to sd no interaction effect between irrigation rate and method was found over the course of our study 3 6 crop water use efficiency wuec in grapevine was significantly affected both by irrigation rate and method across the two years of study table 3 decreases in irrigation rate from high to moderate and from high to low resulted in 14 19 and 42 56 increased wuec respectively drz improved wuec of grapevine by 9 11 compared to sd no interaction effect between irrigation rate and method was found on wuec during this study 4 discussion this two year study found improvements in grape yield and wuec using direct root zone irrigation drz compared to traditional surface drip irrigation sd in a commercial vineyard with loamy sand soil in a semi arid climate of washington state with the advantages provided by traditional sdi howell et al 1997 drz potentially reduces soil water evaporation and restricts the available water for weed growth in shallow soil juárez escario et al 2017 by irrigating grapevines at a deeper soil depth e g 60 cm in our study which possibly provides more water for grapevines to increase yield and wuec notably a recent study showed no significant difference in delivery depth 30 60 or 90 cm using drz ma et al 2019 indicating that irrigation rate is the major factor for regulation of the yield and wuec in our focal area previous studies also show the advantages of sdi on yield and wuec of grape ma et al 2019 mirás avalos et al 2017 pisciotta et al 2018 and other woody perennial crops such as pomegranate zhang et al 2017 citrus martínez gimeno et al 2018 and poplar paris et al 2018 however soil texture affects the performance of irrigation systems due to its influence on soil water retention and distribution siyal and skaggs 2009 for example water quickly applied to the surface of fine textured soil e g clay soil is absorbed slowly and has a tendency to run off but the water could be retained longer compared to course textured soil therefore sdi could increase soil water content and perform better than sd in fine textured soil for higher yield and wuec al omran et al 2005 moreover a recent study reported that sdi can dilute the concentration of solutes in loam soil by reducing evaporation of irrigation water bern et al 2013 in contrast excessively localized sdi possibly causes water infiltration and salinization in course textured soil e g sandy soil which may hamper the development of subsurface irrigation strategies ayars et al 2015 lamm et al 2007 these pros and cons need to be carefully defined based on soil type through future studies during this study the variable weather conditions between years did not change the treatment effects on grape yield and wuec however it influenced grapevine phenology lower temperatures between bud break and flowering stages triggered delay of flowering in 2017 which was also reported in previous studies costa et al 2019 jones and davis 2000 parker et al 2011 van leeuwen and darriet 2016 lower annual temperature could be the reason for a longer period of active growth from bud break to harvest that was observed in 2017 according to a long term study of climatic impact on grapevine phenology tomasi et al 2011 bud break is highly sensitive to temperature tomasi et al 2011 however the significantly lower temperature in early 2017 did not delay the date of bud break which was probably due to the insignificant difference in temperature around bud break treatment effects on ψstem md were consistent between years cooler average temperature and significantly higher cumulative precipitation before fruit set in 2017 resulted in higher ψstem md before treatment started compared to 2018 grapevines irrigated through drz had significantly higher ψstem md at later growing stages which was probably due to reduced soil water evaporation therefore more available water to compensate for diurnal water stress ayars et al 2015 differences in treatment effects on ψstem md became more significant after veraison due to accumulated effects of deficit irrigation with increased temperature and extremely limited rainfall similar to the findings of a previous study fereres and soriano 2007 types of irrigation system and the frequency and duration of irrigation events influence plant rooting patterns ansley et al 2014 bassoi et al 2003 sharma et al 2018 which was also found in our study limited water availability restricts root growth farooq et al 2009 osmont et al 2007 which could be used to explain the insignificant difference in total root number between the two irrigation methods at the low irrigation rate decreased total root number and rld in the upper soil profile with higher ψstem md were found in grapevines irrigated through drz suggesting a deep root system might have developed below 60 cm which helped acquire groundwater to compensate for the water deficit bleby et al 2010 savi et al 2018 root development in grapevine shows a seasonal pattern with functional roots growing deeper into the soil profile for water uptake after fruit set karakis et al 2018 based on this pattern applying the drz method from fruit set to harvest could be an efficient irrigation strategy by delivering the water directly to the functional root zone to improve wuec plants not under water stress have more carbon and nitrogen resources for aboveground growth and production farooq et al 2009 shang et al 2019 which could be another reason for higher yield in grapevines under drz irrigation method showed no significant effect on most qualitative parameters of berries excepting the significantly lower brix in berries under drz in the first year lower annual temperature elongated the phenological period from bud break to harvest in 2017 which may help differentiate the effects of deficit irrigation through the two irrigation methods jones and davis 2000 lower brix in berries under drz was probably due to lower water stress in grapevine which significantly reduced accumulation of soluble sugars kuhn et al 2014 it indicates that higher brix could be achieved through the drz by using less water while sustaining grape yield compared to sd method which also improves wuec sharma and upadhyay 2011 reported that similar amounts of yield and tss were attained under sdi with 25 less irrigated water than sd contrasting results are reported in the literature regarding the qualitative responses of grapevines to sdi versus sd methods pisciotta et al 2018 found no significant influence of sdi on berry composition compared to sd however acevedo opazo et al 2010 reported significant differences in qualitative parameters among seasons and different water status in grapevines inconsistent results could be caused by differences in types of soil grape variety and climatic conditions water deficit significantly restricted berry weight and size in both years due to the important function of available water on berry cell division and expansion keller 2010 roby and matthews 2008 this study is an initial step to develop a more efficient sdi method for sustaining grape production and adapting to potential threats from global water shortages and unstable climatic patterns drz provides flexible ways to adjust irrigation rate and water delivery depth for optimizing water productivity and regulating berry development in semi arid regions a long term study needs to be conducted to evaluate the economic and environmental benefits of drz compared to traditional irrigation techniques under different scenarios for improving the design of the current drz system and to better define the optimum conditions for successful application of the drz method 5 conclusions this study demonstrated the advantages of direct root zone irrigation drz over the surface drip irrigation sd on grape yield 9 12 increase and crop water use efficiency 9 11 increase in loamy sand soil in a semi arid climate berry morphology and composition could potentially be controlled by regulating the irrigation rate reduced soil water evaporation and development of deep root system could be the reasons why grapevines irrigated through drz displayed lower diurnal water stress which needs to be tested in future studies also desirable conditions for utilization of drz should be carefully identified through a long term study e g 10 years which can better evaluate the economic and environmental benefits of drz compared to traditional irrigation strategies under different

l with a total farming area of nearly 10 25 million ha is a substantial oilseed crop which is widely cultivated in many parts of the world fao 2017 although this plant is commonly cultivated in arid and semi arid climates as a drought tolerant crop water deficit can lead to decline in growth seed yield and oil quantity and quality of the plant mensah et al 2006 golestani and pakniyat 2007 the average annual rainfall of iran is 228 mm and approximately 90 of the country possesses arid or semi arid climate moradi et al 2013 therefore drought stress is the most important abiotic stress that threatens crop production and yield sustainability in the region water deficit causes the increase of reactive oxygen species ros accumulation in plants increased levels of ros causes damage to various cellular mechanisms such as enzyme inhibition protein degradation dna and rna damage and membrane lipid peroxidation which ultimately culminate in cell death hussein et al 2015 advanced agronomical practices traditional breeding and modern biotechnological tools have been used to prevent the yield losses due to drought stress sharma et al 2019 biotechnological tools as well as traditional breeding are today used to make cultivation less sensitive to drought stress however these methods are time consuming and expensive janani et al 2016 adapting crop to drought stress would be the most economical strategy to improve water use efficiency and crop productivity hussein et al 2015 exogenous application of phytohormones and biostimulants are known as the effective adapting methods elansary et al 2016 el mageed et al 2017 it illustrated that foliar application of phytohormones such as sa can lead to intake of higher tissue water content increased antioxidant enzyme activities decreased level of lipid peroxidation and membrane injury and protected nitrate reductase activity against growth inhibition under water deficit conditions sakhabutdinova et al 2003 umebese et al 2009 these activities result in regulation of the plant metabolism and improving growth and yield itai et al 1978 natural biostimulants as the eco friendly materials include any substances applied to plants with the aim of enhancing nutritional efficiency abiotic stress tolerance and or crop quality traits trivedi et al 2018 application of plant extracts as biostimulants for mitigating abiotic stresses is a novel technique plant extracts are natural and safe for sustainable agriculture without adverse impacts on agro ecosystem sharma et al 2019 based on the above definitions extraction of beeswax waste and licoric can be examined as the natural biostimulants for mitigating drought stress licorice glycyrrhiza glabra is known as a tolerant plant that can survive under adverse conditions such as salinity drought and cold stresses akhani and ghorbanli 1993 amanifar et al 2019 there are several bio active molecules in licorice that may improve performance and tolerance of plants moreover it is suggested that strategies that can enhance antioxidant components in plants e g foliar application may be considered as useful methods to reduce oxidative stress and to increase drought stress tolerance pandey et al 2016 the precise mechanism and available information on the potential of licorice extract application as an agent to improve drought tolerance in plants is limited and needs further investigation and examination iran is the fourth largest producer of honey in the world fao 2016 wax used in this beekeeping industry need to be renewed after several years producing a lot of waste that is usually discarded so honey beeswax waste is a solid waste containing remarkable potentials to be used in croplands moradi et al 2019 unfortunately very few studies have been carried out on the possibility of these waste products in agricultural aspects pourghasemian and moradi 2018 reported that the application of beeswax as a soil amendment leads to increasing soil fertility improving soil physical and biological properties stimulating resistance to drought stress and consequently enhancing borage borago officinalis growth and biomass in iran local farmers also use the beeswax waste as organic mulch for suppressing weeds honey beeswax waste can be considered as a major source of organic amendments because this waste is available in large volume and is inexpensive the literature review illustrates that no study has so far been carried out on determining the effects of the foliar applications of bwe and le for mitigating negative impacts of water deficit on plants the study hypothesis was that these compounds may improve drought stress tolerance of plants particularly for species commonly cultivated in arid and semi arid climates consequently this study was conducted to study the effect of drought stress levels and compare the role of exogenously applied bwe and le as novel natural biostimulants and sa phytohormone on the growth and the biochemical and physiological characteristics of sesame under drought stress conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and experimental design the present study was carried

the figures are means se 3 results 3 1 growth parameters drought stress caused a considerable decrease in all the sesame growth parameters fig 2 biological yield was significantly affected by drought stress foliar application and interaction effects of drought foliar application fig 2 data presented in fig 2 shows that bwe le and sa foliar application improved biological yield compared to water foliar application in both stress and non stress conditions at non drought stress condition foliar spray of bwe sa and le increased biological yield by 12 3 7 8 and 4 6 respectively compared to water foliar spray this increase in moderate stress was in 13 8 7 8 and 7 6 and for severe stress was in 16 7 16 and 8 9 respectively the anova results showed that drought foliar application and interaction effect of drought stress foliar application had significant effect on seed yield fig 2 seed yield was 1552 1019 and 687 kg ha 1 in none moderate and severe drought stress conditions caused by water foliar application the studied index was increased by foliar spray of bwe le and sa when compared with water foliar spray in both stress and non stress conditions however bwe foliar application produced the highest seed yield under all the irrigation levels the trait increment by bwe application compared to water application was by 13 45 and 30 in full irrigation moderate and severe stress respectively the results showed that drought stress foliar application and interaction effect of them significantly affected sesame shoot height fig 2 under water foliar spray the reduction of irrigation levels from full irrigation to moderate and severe drought stress led to plant height decline by 16 and 43 respectively fig 2 the plant height was reduced by application of bwe le and sa more than water application at moderate stress level whereby the highest reduction 20 was assigned to bwe treatment however under full irrigation and severe drought stress foliar application with bwe le and sa had no significant effect on plant height lai was significantly affected by foliar application drought stress and interaction of them fig 2 lai values in water application treatment were 4 19 3 67 and 3 14 for full irrigation moderate and severe drought stress respectively in all the irrigation levels a significant increase was observed in the trait by foliar application of bwe le and sa compared to water however the highest increment in lai was obtained by bwe foliar application fig 2 3 2 lipid peroxidation lipid peroxidation was significantly affected by foliar application drought stress and interaction effect of drought stress foliar application fig 3 under the drought stress treatment mda accumulation increased significantly during the experimental period as compared to full irrigation in all of the foliar application foliar application of the substances had no significant effect on mda under full irrigation condition however foliar application of bwe le and sa decreased mda content as compared to water for those plants grown under moderate and severe drought stress the highest decreasing content of mda was induced by bwe 3 3 photosynthetic pigments chlorophyll a and b were significantly affected by drought stress foliar application and the interaction effect of drought foliar application the greatest and smallest content of chlorophyll a and b were observed at moderate and severe drought stress respectively concerning the impact of foliar application the data in fig 3 display that the highest chlorophyll a and b content was obtained from foliar use with bwe at three irrigation levels at none and moderate drought stress situation foliar application with water le and sa didn t show any significant difference in all contents of chlorophyll a and b at severe drought stress condition spraying sesame plant with le bwe and sa increased chlorophyll a by 40 65 and 46 respectively relative to water application also this increase was 78 100 and 73 respectively in chlorophyll b there was no visible influence of the foliar application and interaction effect of drought stress foliar application on carotenoid content but drought stress significantly increased the carotenoid trait fig 3 carotenoid content was 8 8 10 06 and 12 mg g 1 fw in none moderate and severe drought stress respectively 3 4 proline proline content was increased by drought stress and was decreased by foliar application of the substances fig 4 the application of bwe le and sa as compared to that of water mitigated the adverse effects of water deficit on proline however there was no remarkable difference between bwe le and sa treatments under both moderate and severe level of drought stress 3 5 protein protein was significantly affected by drought stress foliar application and interaction effect of drought foliar application protein in the no drought stress treatments was not influenced by exogenous application of the substances fig 4 a significant increase in protein was observed in sesame leaves under water deficit condition particularly when bwe was used as foliar application fig 4 under moderate stress condition foliar usage of le bwe and sa improved protein by about 4 36 and 25 respectively compared to the water use also these increases under severe drought conditions were about 16 25 and 2 respectively 3 6 antioxidant enzyme activities data showed that antioxidant enzymes activities cat apx and gpx were significantly affected by drought stress foliar application and interaction effect of drought foliar application but gr activity was only influenced p 0 01 by drought stress fig 5 all of the antioxidant enzymes activities were increased with change from fully irrigated situation to drought stress fig 5 however this trend was not the same for all the enzymes activities bwe and sa increased cat and apx activities relative to water and le treatments in full irrigation condition cat gpx and apx activities followed the same patterns in response to foliar application when exposed to the stress conditions under moderate stress le bwe and sa usage raised cat gpx and apx activities in contrast to the usage of water this increment was about 26 44 and 20 for cat 15 43 and 11 for apx 15 36 and 17 for gpx in severe drought medium the greatest and lowest activity of cat apx and gpx was observed with bwe foliar application and water foliar application respectively 3 7 chlorophyll fluorescence and gas exchange chlorophyll fluorescence was significantly affected by drought stress foliar application and interaction effect of drought foliar application fig 6 fv fm was averagely decreased under severe and moderate stress in contrast with full irrigation however the amount of decline was higher for severe stress under none and moderate drought stress foliar treatments had no effects on fv fm but application of bwe le and sa increased the trait by 13 24 and 11 under severe stress compared to water foliar treatment respectively pn ls gs tr and wue were significantly affected by drought stress foliar application and interaction effect of drought foliar application fig 6 in contrast to the full irrigation drought stress increased ls but decreased pn gs tr and wue under severe and moderate stress pn was averagely reduced by 39 and 17 respectively compared to the full irrigation these declines were 22 and 12 for gs 9 and 34 for tr and 10 and 9 for wue however ls was increased from 58 13 under full irrigation condition to 66 88 and 115 08 under moderate and severe stress condition respectively foliar usage treatments were ineffective in ls and gs tr and wue at no stress conditions however bwe foliar application increased pn compared to the other foliar applications under drought stress foliar treatments with bwe lec and sa decreased ls and increased pn gs tr and wue in contrast to the water foliar spray 4 discussion drought stress impairs plant growth for most crop plants by reducing growth parameters and disrupts the plant antioxidant function by promoting ros accumulation sharma et al 2019 turgor pressure loss in water deficit condition commonly results in decline of cell expansion which leads to reducing plant growth parameters such as leaf area and number height dry weight and seed yield taiz and zeiger 2012 the present study also indicated that drought stress reduced growth parameters height biological yield seed yield and lai compared with full irrigation fig 2 under drought and non drought stress foliar application of le sa and especially bwe promoted almost all the growth parameters compared to water foliar application in other researches it was found that foliar application with bio stimulating substances lead to plant growth improvement under stress and non stress conditions rady et al 2019 el mageed et al 2017 according to the fact that bwe is rich in mineral nutrients n p k ca mg fe zn cu mn vitamin c 88 vitamin e 54 and flavonoid table 1 foliar application of this extract greatly enhanced biological yield seed yield and lai compared to the other substances foliar sprays furthermore such increments in growth parameters might be attributed to the enhancement of antioxidant activities fig 5 gas exchange fig 6 and chlorophyll pigments content in leaves fig 3 semida and rady 2014 also illustrated that propolise extract and maize grain extract for common bean in the nacl stress and non stress conditions enhanced the growth of plants they mentioned that this may be due to that propolise extract and maize grain extract are rich in some growth stimulants such as amino acids many mineral elements and some phytohormons etc in the present study sa application as a phytohormone increased growth parameters under both full irrigation condition and drought stress however this increase was higher when sa was used under drought stress condition fig 2 this result was in agreement with that obtained by la et al 2019 who found that the antagonistic interaction of sa with some stressed hormones such as aba is more strongly activated under drought stress aba can decrease photosynthesis by decreasing stomatal conductance sreenivasulu et al 2012 it seems that the increase in gs pn and wue values as affected by sa fig 6 may be due to the role of this phytohormone in decreasing aba levels also the interesting finding in the present study is that foliar application of bwe improved growth parameters more than sa in conditions of non stress and moderate stress sa spray was similar to that of le spray therefore it shows that there may be an antagonistic relationship between exogenous application of bwe and le with aba the alleviated effect of le on drought stress can be related to its components table 1 these results are in agreement with the findings of rady et al 2019 that found the application of licorice extract as foliar spray increased common bean growth and yield under salt and non salt stress analysis of licorice extracts by rady et al 2019 indicated the presence of various amino acids methionine glutamic acid lysine cysteine histidine threonine phenylalanine arginine proline and aspartic acid micro and macro nutrients fe cu zn mg n p k and ca sucrose glucose and gibberellic acid in addition elrys and merwad 2017 introduced licoric extract as an effective biostimulant to enhance growth parameters and productivity of plants membranes lipid peroxidation occurs due to excessive amount of ros and is an indication of membrane damage under biotic and abiotic stresses amirjani and mahdiyeh 2013 under the effect of irrigation treatments moderate and severe drought stress mda content was increased compared to full irrigation fig 3 also under drought stress ls was increased and gs pn tr and wue decreased fig 6 and these results might be due to the closure of the stomata stomata closure is a quick response to drought stress and an efficient way to reduce water loss under these conditions however this phenomenon leads to a reduction of carbon dioxide fixation while light reaction and electrons transfer continue normally under such condition nadp will become limited in the acceptance of the electrons and so causes the production of higher ros o2 o2 h2o2 and oh radicals sergery 2012 which results in cell membrane lipid peroxidation increasing mda fig 3 and decreasing fv fm fig 6 photosynthetic pigments fig 3 pn tr and wue fig 6 resulting seed and biological yield reduction in this study the reduction in pn together with increased mda as discussed above caused the decrease in the biological and seed yield this result is in parallel to what has been obtained by nemati et al 2019 in wheat trivedi et al 2018 in maize and shaheen et al 2013 in eggplant however in our study foliar spray treatments except for water treatment were effective in decreasing the mda contents and increasing pn wue fv fm chlorophyll pigments and enzymes activities cat apx and gpx under stress conditions figs 3 and 6 it was revealed that biostimulant extract components such as phenol flavonoids ascorbic acid and α tocopherol with increasing the scavenging activity and oxygen absorbance capacity can cause great impact on elevating abiotic stress tolerance and reducing physiological damage xu and leskovar 2015 phenol flavonoids ascorbic acid and α tocopherol as non enzymatic antioxidants were quantified for licorice and beeswax waste extract in our study table 1 therefore it seems that both of them especially bwe have high antioxidant capacity and can decline lipid peroxidation and other physiological deterioration to improve stress tolerance phytohormones such as sa la et al 2019 or natural based biostimulants extract rich in antioxidants such as licorice root extract rady et al 2019 or propolise extract can be used for the regulation of ros generation semida and rady 2014 in the present study bwe application was most effective in lowering the mda contents and increasing cat apx and gpx activities as compared to the other foliar applications fig 3 therefore it seems that the honey beeswax waste is rich in some hormones the content of chlorophyll a and b in moderate stress was more than that of full irrigation condition fig 3 increasing chlorophyll was consistent with decreasing lai fig 2 it demonstrated that the water deficit declines the cell size leading decrease in lai and increase in leaf specific weight chaturvedi et al 2019 so in moderate stress the chlorophyll concentration could be increased because of higher cells per unit of weight chlorophyll content and fluorescence were significantly decreased under severe stress figs 3 and 6 this phenomenon can be in terms of photosynthetic damage as affected by water deficit li et al 2019 also chlorophyll fluorescence has been cited usually in response to extreme water deficit condition mishra et al 2014 however foliar application of the substances especially bwe could prevent chlorophyll degradation and photosynthetic destructions with some antioxidants such as vitamin c vitamin e phenol and flavonoid table 1 or the bwe components may be active in producing more biosynthesis of photosynthetic pigments because of their richness in mineral nutrients the application of the biostimulant boosted the photosynthetic active leaf area and leaf area duration maintaining chlorophyll in higher concentration fig 3 presence of non enzymatic antioxidant and nutrients in bwe and le can prevent premature leaf senescence and can maintain higher lai and rise photosynthetic pigments rady et al 2019 since fe is one of the most important involved elements in pathway of chlorophyll biosynthesis james et al 1984 existence of the element in the studied biostimulant can improve the plant photosynthesis and growth rate foliar application of bwe le and sa increased wue under drought stress the increment in wue by foliar application of the biostimulants could be achieved by increasing net assimilation or decreasing transpiration boari et al 2015 in the current study increasing pn plays more fundamental role than decreasing tr in wue improvement fig 6 under full irrigation the foliar application had no effect on sesame leaf chlorophyll fluorescence ls gs wue and tr fig 6 similar to our results under no stress some biostimulants extracts licorice and seaweed extract had no significant effects on the leaf gas exchange and fv fm xu and leskovar 2015 rady et al 2019 these results were in disagreement with those obtained by nazar et al 2015 who found that under no stress sa foliar application increased chlorophyll fluorescence and photosynthetic parameters in mustard some biostimulant substances were also found effective in increasing photosynthetic parameters and chlorophyll pigments content in tomato kumari et al 2011 and common sage kaoaua et al 2013 this contradiction in the mentioned results can be due to the difference in kind of the plant in this study enzymatic antioxidant activity such as cat apx gpx and gr have been measured the results showed that cat apx gpx activity was increased by elevating drought stress fig 5 however this increment was higher under moderate stress compared to severe stress the reduction of enzymatic antioxidants activity at severe abiotic stress conditions may be due to the elimination of enzyme synthesis and change in the collection of enzyme subunits pourghasemian et al 2019a b our observation showed that sesame leaf exposed to the foliar application of the substance sa bwe and le had higher activity of the antioxidant enzymes cat apx and gpx than the foliar application with water fig 5 improving the drought stress tolerance however the ability of bwe to produce these enzymes was more than any other substances mineral nutrients found in bwe especially fe may exist in the sesame tissues after foliar application to stimulate many of the enzymes that are involved in the biosynthesis of chlorophyll and some antioxidant enzymes such as cat which convert h2o2 to water and oxygen and lead to protecting chlorophyll against drought stress zayed et al 2011 also peroxides such as apx reduce h2o2 to water with several reductants i e phenolic guaiacol and ascorbate compounds apel and hirt 2004 on the other hand bwe is rich in ascorbic acid and phenol therefore this substance can increase enzyme antioxidant activities the plants under water deficit can change synthesis of some cellular biochemical metabolites to protect themselves against oxidative stress rai et al 2012 the accumulation of proline and protein in plants are the well known drought stress indicators for balancing the osmotic pressure and scavenging the ros gill and tuteja 2010 in the present study the increment in the proline content fig 4 protein content fig 4 and enzyme antioxidant activity fig 5 was affected by deficit stress in other words drought stress increased the proline and protein contents and antioxidant activities as the drought tolerance mechanism in plants elansary et al 2016 however foliar application treatments declined proline content at drought stress condition fig 4 the result is similar to those found by elansary et al 2016 under drought stress foliar application with substances phytohormone sa and biostimulate beeswax waste and licorice caused substantial effects on inducing sesame drought stress tolerance by means of enhancing the antioxidant enzyme activities and protein content and reducing proline accumulation as well as increasing photosynthetic pigments and gas exchange parameters 5 conclusion the results illustrated that soil moisture stress caused growth parameters disruption of sesame by reducing chlorophyll pigments and florescence stomata conductivity and photosynthetic rate results of the present study demonstrated that exogenous application of biostimulants bwe and le and sa in sesame under drought stress induced tolerance to drought stress the mitigated effect of bwe on drought stress was more effective than that of sa as an industrial and expensive phytohormone it could also be concluded that bwe can be utilized as an economical and natural source of mineral nutrients antioxidants and osmoprotectants instead of their corresponding synthesized substitutes declaration of competing interest

l with a total farming area of nearly 10 25 million ha is a substantial oilseed crop which is widely cultivated in many parts of the world fao 2017 although this plant is commonly cultivated in arid and semi arid climates as a drought tolerant crop water deficit can lead to decline in growth seed yield and oil quantity and quality of the plant mensah et al 2006 golestani and pakniyat 2007 the average annual rainfall of iran is 228 mm and approximately 90 of the country possesses arid or semi arid climate moradi et al 2013 therefore drought stress is the most important abiotic stress that threatens crop production and yield sustainability in the region water deficit causes the increase of reactive oxygen species ros accumulation in plants increased levels of ros causes damage to various cellular mechanisms such as enzyme inhibition protein degradation dna and rna damage and membrane lipid peroxidation which ultimately culminate in cell death hussein et al 2015 advanced agronomical practices traditional breeding and modern biotechnological tools have been used to prevent the yield losses due to drought stress sharma et al 2019 biotechnological tools as well as traditional breeding are today used to make cultivation less sensitive to drought stress however these methods are time consuming and expensive janani et al 2016 adapting crop to drought stress would be the most economical strategy to improve water use efficiency and crop productivity hussein et al 2015 exogenous application of phytohormones and biostimulants are known as the effective adapting methods elansary et al 2016 el mageed et al 2017 it illustrated that foliar application of phytohormones such as sa can lead to intake of higher tissue water content increased antioxidant enzyme activities decreased level of lipid peroxidation and membrane injury and protected nitrate reductase activity against growth inhibition under water deficit conditions sakhabutdinova et al 2003 umebese et al 2009 these activities result in regulation of the plant metabolism and improving growth and yield itai et al 1978 natural biostimulants as the eco friendly materials include any substances applied to plants with the aim of enhancing nutritional efficiency abiotic stress tolerance and or crop quality traits trivedi et al 2018 application of plant extracts as biostimulants for mitigating abiotic stresses is a novel technique plant extracts are natural and safe for sustainable agriculture without adverse impacts on agro ecosystem sharma et al 2019 based on the above definitions extraction of beeswax waste and licoric can be examined as the natural biostimulants for mitigating drought stress licorice glycyrrhiza glabra is known as a tolerant plant that can survive under adverse conditions such as salinity drought and cold stresses akhani and ghorbanli 1993 amanifar et al 2019 there are several bio active molecules in licorice that may improve performance and tolerance of plants moreover it is suggested that strategies that can enhance antioxidant components in plants e g foliar application may be considered as useful methods to reduce oxidative stress and to increase drought stress tolerance pandey et al 2016 the precise mechanism and available information on the potential of licorice extract application as an agent to improve drought tolerance in plants is limited and needs further investigation and examination iran is the fourth largest producer of honey in the world fao 2016 wax used in this beekeeping industry need to be renewed after several years producing a lot of waste that is usually discarded so honey beeswax waste is a solid waste containing remarkable potentials to be used in croplands moradi et al 2019 unfortunately very few studies have been carried out on the possibility of these waste products in agricultural aspects pourghasemian and moradi 2018 reported that the application of beeswax as a soil amendment leads to increasing soil fertility improving soil physical and biological properties stimulating resistance to drought stress and consequently enhancing borage borago officinalis growth and biomass in iran local farmers also use the beeswax waste as organic mulch for suppressing weeds honey beeswax waste can be considered as a major source of organic amendments because this waste is available in large volume and is inexpensive the literature review illustrates that no study has so far been carried out on determining the effects of the foliar applications of bwe and le for mitigating negative impacts of water deficit on plants the study hypothesis was that these compounds may improve drought stress tolerance of plants particularly for species commonly cultivated in arid and semi arid climates consequently this study was conducted to study the effect of drought stress levels and compare the role of exogenously applied bwe and le as novel natural biostimulants and sa phytohormone on the growth and the biochemical and physiological characteristics of sesame under drought stress conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and experimental design the present study was carried

variance anova using sas statistical program sas institute 2003 and the difference between treatment means at level of 95 was separated using least significant difference test lsd all values shown in the figures are means se 3 results 3 1 growth parameters drought stress caused a considerable decrease in all the sesame growth parameters fig 2 biological yield was significantly affected by drought stress foliar application and interaction effects of drought foliar application fig 2 data presented in fig 2 shows that bwe le and sa foliar application improved biological yield compared to water foliar application in both stress and non stress conditions at non drought stress condition foliar spray of bwe sa and le increased biological yield by 12 3 7 8 and 4 6 respectively compared to water foliar spray this increase in moderate stress was in 13 8 7 8 and 7 6 and for severe stress was in 16 7 16 and 8 9 respectively the anova results showed that drought foliar application and interaction effect of drought stress foliar application had significant effect on seed yield fig 2 seed yield was 1552 1019 and 687 kg ha 1 in none moderate and severe drought stress conditions caused by water foliar application the studied index was increased by foliar spray of bwe le and sa when compared with water foliar spray in both stress and non stress conditions however bwe foliar application produced the highest seed yield under all the irrigation levels the trait increment by bwe application compared to water application was by 13 45 and 30 in full irrigation moderate and severe stress respectively the results showed that drought stress foliar application and interaction effect of them significantly affected sesame shoot height fig 2 under water foliar spray the reduction of irrigation levels from full irrigation to moderate and severe drought stress led to plant height decline by 16 and 43 respectively fig 2 the plant height was reduced by application of bwe le and sa more than water application at moderate stress level whereby the highest reduction 20 was assigned to bwe treatment however under full irrigation and severe drought stress foliar application with bwe le and sa had no significant effect on plant height lai was significantly affected by foliar application drought stress and interaction of them fig 2 lai values in water application treatment were 4 19 3 67 and 3 14 for full irrigation moderate and severe drought stress respectively in all the irrigation levels a significant increase was observed in the trait by foliar application of bwe le and sa compared to water however the highest increment in lai was obtained by bwe foliar application fig 2 3 2 lipid peroxidation lipid peroxidation was significantly affected by foliar application drought stress and interaction effect of drought stress foliar application fig 3 under the drought stress treatment mda accumulation increased significantly during the experimental period as compared to full irrigation in all of the foliar application foliar application of the substances had no significant effect on mda under full irrigation condition however foliar application of bwe le and sa decreased mda content as compared to water for those plants grown under moderate and severe drought stress the highest decreasing content of mda was induced by bwe 3 3 photosynthetic pigments chlorophyll a and b were significantly affected by drought stress foliar application and the interaction effect of drought foliar application the greatest and smallest content of chlorophyll a and b were observed at moderate and severe drought stress respectively concerning the impact of foliar application the data in fig 3 display that the highest chlorophyll a and b content was obtained from foliar use with bwe at three irrigation levels at none and moderate drought stress situation foliar application with water le and sa didn t show any significant difference in all contents of chlorophyll a and b at severe drought stress condition spraying sesame plant with le bwe and sa increased chlorophyll a by 40 65 and 46 respectively relative to water application also this increase was 78 100 and 73 respectively in chlorophyll b there was no visible influence of the foliar application and interaction effect of drought stress foliar application on carotenoid content but drought stress significantly increased the carotenoid trait fig 3 carotenoid content was 8 8 10 06 and 12 mg g 1 fw in none moderate and severe drought stress respectively 3 4 proline proline content was increased by drought stress and was decreased by foliar application of the substances fig 4 the application of bwe le and sa as compared to that of water mitigated the adverse effects of water deficit on proline however there was no remarkable difference between bwe le and sa treatments under both moderate and severe level of drought stress 3 5 protein protein was significantly affected by drought stress foliar application and interaction effect of drought foliar application protein in the no drought stress treatments was not influenced by exogenous application of the substances fig 4 a significant increase in protein was observed in sesame leaves under water deficit condition particularly when bwe was used as foliar application fig 4 under moderate stress condition foliar usage of le bwe and sa improved protein by about 4 36 and 25 respectively compared to the water use also these increases under severe drought conditions were about 16 25 and 2 respectively 3 6 antioxidant enzyme activities data showed that antioxidant enzymes activities cat apx and gpx were significantly affected by drought stress foliar application and interaction effect of drought foliar application but gr activity was only influenced p 0 01 by drought stress fig 5 all of the antioxidant enzymes activities were increased with change from fully irrigated situation to drought stress fig 5 however this trend was not the same for all the enzymes activities bwe and sa increased cat and apx activities relative to water and le treatments in full irrigation condition cat gpx and apx activities followed the same patterns in response to foliar application when exposed to the stress conditions under moderate stress le bwe and sa usage raised cat gpx and apx activities in contrast to the usage of water this increment was about 26 44 and 20 for cat 15 43 and 11 for apx 15 36 and 17 for gpx in severe drought medium the greatest and lowest activity of cat apx and gpx was observed with bwe foliar application and water foliar application respectively 3 7 chlorophyll fluorescence and gas exchange chlorophyll fluorescence was significantly affected by drought stress foliar application and interaction effect of drought foliar application fig 6 fv fm was averagely decreased under severe and moderate stress in contrast with full irrigation however the amount of decline was higher for severe stress under none and moderate drought stress foliar treatments had no effects on fv fm but application of bwe le and sa increased the trait by 13 24 and 11 under severe stress compared to water foliar treatment respectively pn ls gs tr and wue were significantly affected by drought stress foliar application and interaction effect of drought foliar application fig 6 in contrast to the full irrigation drought stress increased ls but decreased pn gs tr and wue under severe and moderate stress pn was averagely reduced by 39 and 17 respectively compared to the full irrigation these declines were 22 and 12 for gs 9 and 34 for tr and 10 and 9 for wue however ls was increased from 58 13 under full irrigation condition to 66 88 and 115 08 under moderate and severe stress condition respectively foliar usage treatments were ineffective in ls and gs tr and wue at no stress conditions however bwe foliar application increased pn compared to the other foliar applications under drought stress foliar treatments with bwe lec and sa decreased ls and increased pn gs tr and wue in contrast to the water foliar spray 4 discussion drought stress impairs plant growth for most crop plants by reducing growth parameters and disrupts the plant antioxidant function by promoting ros accumulation sharma et al 2019 turgor pressure loss in water deficit condition commonly results in decline of cell expansion which leads to reducing plant growth parameters such as leaf area and number height dry weight and seed yield taiz and zeiger 2012 the present study also indicated that drought stress reduced growth parameters height biological yield seed yield and lai compared with full irrigation fig 2 under drought and non drought stress foliar application of le sa and especially bwe promoted almost all the growth parameters compared to water foliar application in other researches it was found that foliar application with bio stimulating substances lead to plant growth improvement under stress and non stress conditions rady et al 2019 el mageed et al 2017 according to the fact that bwe is rich in mineral nutrients n p k ca mg fe zn cu mn vitamin c 88 vitamin e 54 and flavonoid table 1 foliar application of this extract greatly enhanced biological yield seed yield and lai compared to the other substances foliar sprays furthermore such increments in growth parameters might be attributed to the enhancement of antioxidant activities fig 5 gas exchange fig 6 and chlorophyll pigments content in leaves fig 3 semida and rady 2014 also illustrated that propolise extract and maize grain extract for common bean in the nacl stress and non stress conditions enhanced the growth of plants they mentioned that this may be due to that propolise extract and maize grain extract are rich in some growth stimulants such as amino acids many mineral elements and some phytohormons etc in the present study sa application as a phytohormone increased growth parameters under both full irrigation condition and drought stress however this increase was higher when sa was used under drought stress condition fig 2 this result was in agreement with that obtained by la et al 2019 who found that the antagonistic interaction of sa with some stressed hormones such as aba is more strongly activated under drought stress aba can decrease photosynthesis by decreasing stomatal conductance sreenivasulu et al 2012 it seems that the increase in gs pn and wue values as affected by sa fig 6 may be due to the role of this phytohormone in decreasing aba levels also the interesting finding in the present study is that foliar application of bwe improved growth parameters more than sa in conditions of non stress and moderate stress sa spray was similar to that of le spray therefore it shows that there may be an antagonistic relationship between exogenous application of bwe and le with aba the alleviated effect of le on drought stress can be related to its components table 1 these results are in agreement with the findings of rady et al 2019 that found the application of licorice extract as foliar spray increased common bean growth and yield under salt and non salt stress analysis of licorice extracts by rady et al 2019 indicated the presence of various amino acids methionine glutamic acid lysine cysteine histidine threonine phenylalanine arginine proline and aspartic acid micro and macro nutrients fe cu zn mg n p k and ca sucrose glucose and gibberellic acid in addition elrys and merwad 2017 introduced licoric extract as an effective biostimulant to enhance growth parameters and productivity of plants membranes lipid peroxidation occurs due to excessive amount of ros and is an indication of membrane damage under biotic and abiotic stresses amirjani and mahdiyeh 2013 under the effect of irrigation treatments moderate and severe drought stress mda content was increased compared to full irrigation fig 3 also under drought stress ls was increased and gs pn tr and wue decreased fig 6 and these results might be due to the closure of the stomata stomata closure is a quick response to drought stress and an efficient way to reduce water loss under these conditions however this phenomenon leads to a reduction of carbon dioxide fixation while light reaction and electrons transfer continue normally under such condition nadp will become limited in the acceptance of the electrons and so causes the production of higher ros o2 o2 h2o2 and oh radicals sergery 2012 which results in cell membrane lipid peroxidation increasing mda fig 3 and decreasing fv fm fig 6 photosynthetic pigments fig 3 pn tr and wue fig 6 resulting seed and biological yield reduction in this study the reduction in pn together with increased mda as discussed above caused the decrease in the biological and seed yield this result is in parallel to what has been obtained by nemati et al 2019 in wheat trivedi et al 2018 in maize and shaheen et al 2013 in eggplant however in our study foliar spray treatments except for water treatment were effective in decreasing the mda contents and increasing pn wue fv fm chlorophyll pigments and enzymes activities cat apx and gpx under stress conditions figs 3 and 6 it was revealed that biostimulant extract components such as phenol flavonoids ascorbic acid and α tocopherol with increasing the scavenging activity and oxygen absorbance capacity can cause great impact on elevating abiotic stress tolerance and reducing physiological damage xu and leskovar 2015 phenol flavonoids ascorbic acid and α tocopherol as non enzymatic antioxidants were quantified for licorice and beeswax waste extract in our study table 1 therefore it seems that both of them especially bwe have high antioxidant capacity and can decline lipid peroxidation and other physiological deterioration to improve stress tolerance phytohormones such as sa la et al 2019 or natural based biostimulants extract rich in antioxidants such as licorice root extract rady et al 2019 or propolise extract can be used for the regulation of ros generation semida and rady 2014 in the present study bwe application was most effective in lowering the mda contents and increasing cat apx and gpx activities as compared to the other foliar applications fig 3 therefore it seems that the honey beeswax waste is rich in some hormones the content of chlorophyll a and b in moderate stress was more than that of full irrigation condition fig 3 increasing chlorophyll was consistent with decreasing lai fig 2 it demonstrated that the water deficit declines the cell size leading decrease in lai and increase in leaf specific weight chaturvedi et al 2019 so in moderate stress the chlorophyll concentration could be increased because of higher cells per unit of weight chlorophyll content and fluorescence were significantly decreased under severe stress figs 3 and 6 this phenomenon can be in terms of photosynthetic damage as affected by water deficit li et al 2019 also chlorophyll fluorescence has been cited usually in response to extreme water deficit condition mishra et al 2014 however foliar application of the substances especially bwe could prevent chlorophyll degradation and photosynthetic destructions with some antioxidants such as vitamin c vitamin e phenol and flavonoid table 1 or the bwe components may be active in producing more biosynthesis of photosynthetic pigments because of their richness in mineral nutrients the application of the biostimulant boosted the photosynthetic active leaf area and leaf area duration maintaining chlorophyll in higher concentration fig 3 presence of non enzymatic antioxidant and nutrients in bwe and le can prevent premature leaf senescence and can maintain higher lai and rise photosynthetic pigments rady et al 2019 since fe is one of the most important involved elements in pathway of chlorophyll biosynthesis james et al 1984 existence of the element in the studied biostimulant can improve the plant photosynthesis and growth rate foliar application of bwe le and sa increased wue under drought stress the increment in wue by foliar application of the biostimulants could be achieved by increasing net assimilation or decreasing transpiration boari et al 2015 in the current study increasing pn plays more fundamental role than decreasing tr in wue improvement fig 6 under full irrigation the foliar application had no effect on sesame leaf chlorophyll fluorescence ls gs wue and tr fig 6 similar to our results under no stress some biostimulants extracts licorice and seaweed extract had no significant effects on the leaf gas exchange and fv fm xu and leskovar 2015 rady et al 2019 these results were in disagreement with those obtained by nazar et al 2015 who found that under no stress sa foliar application increased chlorophyll fluorescence and photosynthetic parameters in mustard some biostimulant substances were also found effective in increasing photosynthetic parameters and chlorophyll pigments content in tomato kumari et al 2011 and common sage kaoaua et al 2013 this contradiction in the mentioned results can be due to the difference in kind of the plant in this study enzymatic antioxidant activity such as cat apx gpx and gr have been measured the results showed that cat apx gpx activity was increased by elevating drought stress fig 5 however this increment was higher under moderate stress compared to severe stress the reduction of enzymatic antioxidants activity at severe abiotic stress conditions may be due to the elimination of enzyme synthesis and change in the collection of enzyme subunits pourghasemian et al 2019a b our observation showed that sesame leaf exposed to the foliar application of the substance sa bwe and le had higher activity of the antioxidant enzymes cat apx and gpx than the foliar application with water fig 5 improving the drought stress tolerance however the ability of bwe to produce these enzymes was more than any other substances mineral nutrients found in bwe especially fe may exist in the sesame tissues after foliar application to stimulate many of the enzymes that are involved in the biosynthesis of chlorophyll and some antioxidant enzymes such as cat which convert h2o2 to water and oxygen and lead to protecting chlorophyll against drought stress zayed et al 2011 also peroxides such as apx reduce h2o2 to water with several reductants i e phenolic guaiacol and ascorbate compounds apel and hirt 2004 on the other hand bwe is rich in ascorbic acid and phenol therefore this substance can increase enzyme antioxidant activities the plants under water deficit can change synthesis of some cellular biochemical metabolites to protect themselves against oxidative stress rai et al 2012 the accumulation of proline and protein in plants are the well known drought stress indicators for balancing the osmotic pressure and scavenging the ros gill and tuteja 2010 in the present study the increment in the proline content fig 4 protein content fig 4 and enzyme antioxidant activity fig 5 was affected by deficit stress in other words drought stress increased the proline and protein contents and antioxidant activities as the drought tolerance mechanism in plants elansary et al 2016 however foliar application treatments declined proline content at drought stress condition fig 4 the result is similar to those found by elansary et al 2016 under drought stress foliar application with substances phytohormone sa and biostimulate beeswax waste and licorice caused substantial effects on inducing sesame drought stress tolerance by means of enhancing the antioxidant enzyme activities and protein content and reducing proline accumulation as well as increasing photosynthetic pigments and gas exchange parameters 5 conclusion the results illustrated that soil moisture stress caused growth parameters disruption of sesame by reducing chlorophyll pigments and florescence stomata conductivity and photosynthetic rate results of the present study demonstrated that exogenous application of biostimulants bwe and le and sa in sesame under drought stress induced tolerance to drought stress the mitigated effect of bwe on drought stress was more effective than that of sa as an industrial and expensive phytohormone it could also be concluded that bwe can be utilized as an economical and natural source of mineral nutrients antioxidants and osmoprotectants instead of their corresponding synthesized substitutes declaration of competing interest

10712,conceptualising wheat growth yield and water productivity wp relationships with future climate change is necessary for sustainable agriculture and food security this study assessed the climate change influences on wheat yield and wp with and without co2 enrichment under semi arid conditions statically bias corrected climate change projections were coupled with aquacrop model v5 0 to predict the wheat growth span yield and wp variations in punjab pakistan acute wheat seasonal warming characterised by sharp tmin increase than tmax and substantial rainfall drops lead to short growth spans and prompt ample yield reductions however co2 enrichment promises to offset the negative wheat yield trends higher wheat yield vulnerability was detected for the late season climate warming during the grain filling stage wheat yield reduction and the limited influence of beneficial co2 enrichment caused the future wp to decline consistently co2 enrichment featured a noteworthy mitigation role in sustaining and improving future wheat yield and wp in conclusion co2 enrichment could impart some beneficial influences to wheat yield and wp but would not fully eliminate the negative impacts of future climate warming under semi arid conditions of punjab pakistan the reliability of such estimates demands a further in depth examination of crop yield responses to carbon temperature water interactions under various field management conditions keywords climate change wheat yield water productivity semiarid condition 1 introduction anthropogenically forced climate warming led by increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases is reshaping the regional thermal and rainfall regimes besides contributing to increased frequencies of climate driven disasters like floods and droughts elevated co2 concentration in conjunction with other greenhouse gases like o3 is often regarded as the prime driver of climate warming which in turn is prompting crop yield declines across the globe asseng et al 2011 ozturk et al 2017 tao et al 2017 yang et al 2017a according to asseng et al 2015 global wheat yield could drop by 6 for each degree celsius temperature rise in the current mean global temperature schauberger et al 2017 concluded that each day 30 c temperature could cause maize soybean and wheat yield declines of up to 6 in the usa yang et al 2017b projected a 7 and 17 5 reduction in winter and spring wheat yields respectively caused by frequent heat stress events across china by the end of 2100 carl friedrich et al 2018 also predicted substantial losses in global yields of wheat soybean maize and rice for climate warming of 1 5 2 0 c however elevated co2 concentration despite being criticised for triggering climate warming has the potential to improve crop yield by enhancing photosynthesis rates and reducing water lost through transpiration particularly in c3 crops like wheat this phenomenon known as co2 enrichment has the capability of improving the crop water productivity wp an index of crop water use efficiency defined by the ratio of the crop yield and crop evapotranspiration co2 enrichment is well supported by various field experiments according to free air carbon enrichment face experiments an elevated co2 concentration of 450 800 ppm could enhance the crop yields up to 13 ainsworth and rogers 2007 all the aforementioned studies highlighting the negative climate warming impacts on crop yields also acknowledged the mitigation potential of co2 enrichment for maintaining or even improving the future yields and wp nonetheless the extents to which climate warming and co2 enrichment can nullify each other s impacts are not fully understood ainsworth and rogers 2007 deryng et al 2016 karimi et al 2017 li et al 2015 ozturk et al 2017 tao et al 2017 wang et al 2013 comprehending the crop yield and wp responses to such climate change trends is vital for the agriculture dependent economy of pakistan the country has already been listed among the worst climate struck and food insecure nations because of its over reliance on irrigated agriculture constantly diminishing river flows rapid population growth and low adaptive capacity abid et al 2016 khan et al 2016 in pakistan wheat is the staple crop as it makes up to 50 of the daily calorific intake but its yield and cultivation area have been dwindling since 2003 due to climate warming and water shortages in 2014 despite having a good wheat harvest 47 of the country s population faced food insecurity in pakistan wheat production primarily comes from irrigated agricultural lands lying under arid to semi arid conditions for which yield decline threats are very severe food security of the growing population of pakistan is relying on sustaining and or improving wheat production from these arid and semi arid lands facing the extreme climate variations ahmad et al 2004 2015 kirby et al 2017 rahman et al 2018 it is well documented that co2 enrichment has the highest mitigation potential against climate warming under water limited environments iqbal et al 2011 stöckle et al 2018 during a global scale analysis deryng et al 2016 found that positive influences of co2 enrichment on wheat yields and the consequential wp improvements were highest in arid climates specifically under rain fed conditions at the regional scale net advantages or disadvantages originating from the interplay between climate warming and co2 enrichment could vary dramatically sultana et al 2009 concluded that wheat would benefit the most from co2 enrichment under sub humid conditions of pakistan previous studies suggested that co2 enrichment would not withhold the declining wheat yield and wp trends under arid and semi arid conditions of pakistan prompting serious food security concerns it is expected that a 3 c rise by the 2050s would limit the per capita wheat availability to 84 kg per annum compared with the 198 kg per annum in 2012 hussain et al 2018 this work assessed the climate warming influences on wheat yield and wp with and without the inclusion of co2 enrichment the research outcomes contribute to the literature by identifying regional discrepancies related to the interaction between climate warming and co2 enrichment for irrigated wheat under semi arid conditions furthermore by projecting the attainable wheat yields and wp under climate driven constraints this study paves the path for policy makers and stakeholders to devise mitigation strategies addressing food security through sustainable wheat production under semi arid conditions of punjab pakistan 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area in pakistan punjab province is the main wheat producer regarding the yield and cultivation area the pakistan metrological department pmd has been monitoring the climate influences on crop yields such as wheat cotton and maize at the regional agro meteorological centre ramc experimental sites spread across the country we selected the ramc faisalabad site located in punjab fig 1 due to the availability of long term wheat experimental records at the study site the yield responses of eight wheat cultivars to climate variability were examined from 2004 to 2017 in faisalabad district wheat sowing starts from mid november to the end of december and harvesting lasts from mid march to mid april canal water is the main irrigation source as the poor quality groundwater is not suitable for crop production the climate is semi arid with more than 70 of the annual rainfall occurring from june to september during the wheat season the average maximum and minimum temperatures ranges were 23 27 and 3 8 c respectively whereas the cumulative seasonal rainfall varied from 85 to 210 mm well drained sandy clay loam is the dominant soil texture in this area iqbal et al 2011 khan et al 2015 out of 13 consecutive wheat seasons data 11 seasons excluding 2011 2012 and 2013 2014 seasons were available and during each season nine distinct growth stages were recorded at the study site inter seasonal variations of lengths of the growth stages and cumulative heat units expressed as growing degree days gdd along with additional experimental details monitored at the study site are provided in table s1 and s2 and figs s1 and s2 2 2 future climate change projection future climate change projections were derived from the outputs of nine global circulation models gcms listed in table s3 the gcms were selected based on their ability to represent the climate of south asian countries like pakistan india and china biemans et al 2013 chaudhuri and srivastava 2017 hasson et al 2016 lutz et al 2016 mcsweeney et al 2015 ruane and mcdermid 2017 sharmila et al 2015 sooraj et al 2015 su et al 2016 daily gcm outputs of

required for the agricultural impact assessment studies quantile mapping qm is a commonly followed procedure to reduce biases in gcm historic simulations by mapping the cumulative distribution function cdf of a certain variable over cdf of the same variable in observed time series the same empirical cdfs are then applied over the gcm projected future time series details about underlying principals limitations and extensions of the qm and its comparison with other approaches have been extensively discussed in the literature ahmed et al 2013 chen et al 2011 chiyuan et al 2014 ehret et al 2012 eum and cannon 2017 fowler et al 2007 ines and hansen 2006 kum et al 2014 liang et al 2008 miao et al 2016 rockel 2015 sippel et al 2016 teutschbein and seibert 2012 a 30 year daily weather data for the baseline period of 1980 2010 including tmax tmin relative humidity u2 rn and p were collected from the pmd for the weather station located in the study area the qm procedure was applied at the daily time step to statistically bias correct the gcm outputs of six major climate variables during the baseline period as well as during the 2030s and 2060s the cdfs of the gcm ensemble of the daily tmax tmin and p before and after the qm application are presented in fig s3 bias corrected results of annual tmax tmin and p for each gcm during the baseline period are also shown in fig s4 2 3 crop modelling the food and agriculture organisation fao developed the water driven aquacrop model to compute biomass and yield as a function of crop transpiration while maintaining a balance between robustness simplicity and accuracy heng et al 2009 hsiao et al 2009 raes et al 2009 steduto et al 2009 in this study the aquacrop model v5 0 was used to simulate the soil water balance wheat growth and yield production process aquacrop uses the canopy cover cc in place of the leaf area index to determine the actual crop evapotranspiration et by performing a daily water balance based on the water fluxes entering and leaving the soil in the crop root zone at a daily time step the et is further subdivided into the transpiration tr and evaporation e components depending on the atmospheric evaporative demands in the form of reference crop evapotranspiration eto cc and soil moisture as follows heng et al 2009 hsiao et al 2009 raes et al 2009 steduto et al 2009 1 e t e t r 2 e k r k e x 1 c c e t o 3 t r k s k c t r x c c e t o where k r is the evaporation reduction coefficient 0 1 with a small value indicating the insufficient soil moisture in the top 30 cm layer relative to the eto k e x is the maximum soil evaporation coefficient for a fully wet and non shaded surface c c is the actual crop canopy cover adjusted for the micro advective effects k s is the water stress coefficient being equal to 1 and 0 at the field capacity and permanent wilting point respectively and k c t r x is the maximum basal crop coefficient when cc 100 aquacrop computes the above ground biomass b as a product of the seasonal cumulative t r and crop wp normalised for the eto and atmospheric co2 concentration adopting the wp makes the aquacrop applicable to a variety of crops grown at diverse locations under contrasting climate and management regimes the harvestable proportion of the b is the final crop yield which is estimated from the product of b and the crop specific harvest index hi aquacrop has been extensively used for evaluating various crop management practices such as deficit irrigation and projecting future climate change impacts for a variety of crops and climate conditions iqbal et al 2014 paredes et al 2015 toumi et al 2016 xiangxiang et al 2013 yang et al 2017b detailed discussions about the model s working principals can be found in the literature chukalla et al 2015 heng et al 2009 hsiao et al 2009 raes et al 2009 steduto et al 2009 2 3 1 model calibration and validation aquacrop was calibrated for wheat yield growing season length gdds accumulated during the growing season and the soil moisture contents the experimental data collected during eight wheat seasons 2004 2013 were used for model calibration and the validation was conducted for the last three wheat seasons 2014 2017 only 6 of the 11 wheat seasons included the measured moisture contents for a soil depth of 0 90 cm during the validation phase the crop parameters obtained from the model calibration were used to evaluate the simulated wheat yield growing season length soil moisture contents and gdds accumulated during the growing season to run a single simulation aquacrop requires the atmosphere plant soil components in six distinct user defined input files climate file crop file soil file irrigation file management file and the initial soil moisture status iqbal et al 2014 toumi et al 2016 many of the aquacrop inputs particularly those defining the management impacts on crop growth and final yield are termed conservative inputs implying that these would remain constant or change little with time geographic location cultivar or crop management for model calibration we referenced these conservative input parameters for wheat from previous experimental and aquacrop sensitivity analyses studies iqbal et al 2014 jin et al 2018 toumi et al 2016 xiangxiang et al 2013 xing et al 2017 to replicate the crop canopy development and growth processes aquacrop also requires the cultivar specific non conservative inputs which must be collected from the field including days to emergence days to maximum canopy cover days to senescence days to maturity initial canopy cover cco canopy growth coefficient cgc canopy decline coefficient cdc and maximum effective root depths we collected the non conservative inputs from the field experiments conducted in 2004 2017 the number of days and heat units gdd of various growth stages recorded at the study site were not in the model required format therefore we considered that recorded gdds from sowing to emergence heading flowering milk maturity and full maturity were equal to the phenological dates of emergence maximum canopy cover flowering the onset of senescence and harvesting respectively fig s1 among the remaining non conservative inputs the cco was automatically estimated by the aquacrop depending on the seed rate table s2 while the cgc and cdc were adjusted within the fao proposed ranges using a trial and error approach to minimise the differences between the simulation and the observed data thus by fixing the conservative inputs and adjusting the non conservative inputs we calibrated the aquacrop model for each cultivar from 2004 to 2013 for model validation the average non conservative inputs obtained from the model calibration were used table s5 lists these conservative and averaged non conservative inputs the model was run again with table s5 inputs for the validation period and the simulation results were compared with the observed data figs s5 and s6 present the aquacrop performance during the calibration and validation period respectively evaluated based on the nash sutcliffe efficiency root mean square error normalised root mean square error and index of agreement greaves and wang 2016 paredes et al 2015 toumi et al 2016 2 3 2 model revalidation in addition to the field scale calibration and validation a regional scale revalidation of aquacrop was also performed for district faisalabad based on the 17 year 2000 2017 statistical wheat yield data collected from the crop reporting service database government of punjab pakistan http www crs agripunjab gov pk according to a 2011 survey conducted across 23 districts including faisalabad sehar 2006 was the most popular wheat cultivar planted by over 67 of the sampled farmers in the irrigated punjab battese et al 2014 for the study site the field data for sehar 2006 was available during the 2007 2008 and 2008 2009 seasons table s2 the revalidation was conducted for wheat yield using the same input parameters obtained during the aquacrop calibration specifically for sehar 2006 to gauge the cultivar specific field scale model calibration fig s7 presents the revalidation outcomes which suggest that our model calibration approach was successful aquacrop showed a fairly acceptable ability to simulate the regional wheat yield indicating that the calibrated model can be used reliably in assessing climate change impacts 2 3 3 simulation runs table s5 inputs were combined with the bias corrected climate change projection from the gcms to simulate wheat yield during the 2030s and 2060s for future wheat yield simulations the sowing date was fixed as 20 november and the aquacrop irrigation module generated an automatic irrigation schedule with no water stress irrigation was set to trigger when 50 of the total available water in the soil has been depleted temperature rainfall and the atmospheric co2 concentration are the key determinants of crop yield responses to future climate change previous experimental evidence suggested that co2 enrichment could mitigate the climate warming threats of crop yield reduction the probable increases in baseline co2 concentrations for rcp 4 5 and 8 5 included in this study to detect the beneficial co2 enrichment influences were referenced from the literature and are shown in table s4 ainsworth and rogers 2007 asseng et al 2013 2015 carl friedrich et al 2018 deryng et al 2016 ozturk et al 2017 tao et al 2017 to discern the potential beneficial influences of co2 enrichment two simulation sets were run with the first accounting for only the climate variations while keeping the co2 concentrations at the baseline level and the second accounting for the combined effect of climate variations and elevated co2 concentrations apart from wheat yield and et net irrigation water requirements niwr were also simulated for future climate change scenarios with and without the inclusion of co2 enrichment effects 2 4 wheat water productivity crop wp or simply wp referring to crop yield produced per unit of freshwater kg m 3 used in the form of et irrigation or total water irrigation rainfall is an indicator of efficient agricultural water usage crop wp can be further categorised as yield per unit of water lost as et wpet yield per unit of irrigation water applied wpirr and yield per unit of total water wptw use mathematically the wps can be expressed as the following equations bastiaanssen and steduto 2017 kijne et al 2003 4 w p e t y i e l d k g h a 1 e t m 3 h a 1 5 w p i r r y i e l d k g h a 1 i r r i g a t i o n m 3 h a 1 6 w p t w y i e l d k g h a 1 t o t a l w a t e r u s e m 3 h a 1 shortened crop growth spans and fewer seasonal rainfalls are expected to prevail in the future due to climate warming asseng et al 2011 2015 thus the seasonal cumulative rainwater supply crop et and niwr would also decline but the daily et rates irrigation and rainwater consumption would increase at the same time acharjee et al 2017 conventionally eq 4 6 are used to estimate the crop wps djaman et al 2018 kahlown et al 2007 as the ratio between crop yield and the sum of et irrigation or tw consumption during the crop growth span the overall decline in seasonal cumulative et niwr or tw usage due to growth span shortening could result in higher crop wps but these values would be of little interest if not associated with improved crop yields ali and talukder 2008 to account for the mentioned disparities in the daily and seasonal et irrigation and tw usage behaviours a modified version of wp daily water productivity dwp was adopted as a performance indicator of wheat water use efficiency under climate change contrary to the conventional wps which describe the crop yield achieved at the expense of seasonal cumulative et irrigation or tw use the dwp kg m 3 day describes the final crop yield achieved with reference to the daily consumption rates of the et irrigation and tw during the crop growth span yang et al 2017b for example dwpet was estimated by dividing yield with the ratio of seasonal cumulative evapotranspiration et and growing season length in days similarly the dwpirr and dwptw were also calculated yang et al 2017b in addition to the crop yield and seasonal water usage the dwp also incorporates the daily distribution of rainfall et irrigation and tw consumption during the crop growth span differences between conventionally estimated wps and dwps were also computed to access the suitability of the proposed metric for gauging the climate change impacts 3 results and discussion 3 1 projected future climate change mean median and variability of gcm projected seasonal and annual tmax tmin and p after bias correction are shown in figs 2 4 all the gcms interpreted that the study area would progressively become hotter and drier by the end of the 21st century acute seasonal warming characterised by sharp tmin rising tendencies relative to tmax were projected for wheat under both rcps and time slices rasul et al 2012 also reported that during the last 30 years the tmin was rising at a higher pace than tmax across the indus basin of pakistan compared with the baseline 1980 2010 wheat seasonal tmax and tmin increments averaged across nine gcms for rcp 4 5 were 1 9 2 3 and 2 0 2 5 c respectively while under rcp 8 5 these were 2 2 3 3 and 2 5 3 5 c respectively by the end of 2080 similarly annual tmax and tmin increments of 1 0 2 0 and 1 5 2 5 c for rcp 4 5 and 1 5 2 7 and 1 9 3 0 c for rcp 8 5 were shown by the end of the 21st century figs 2 and 3 future climate projections suggested that wheat seasonal warming would be higher than annual warming these projections were reinforced by the gradual incline detected in wheat seasonal average temperature during the last 30 years across most weather stations in pakistan ahmad and choi 2018 ahmad et al 2014 iqbal et al 2016 trends and magnitudes of climate warming projected in our study were also confirmed by studies predicting the early middle and late 21st century climate of pakistan hussain et al 2018 iqbal et al 2011 islam et al 2009 karimi et al 2018 projected a higher increase in wheat seasonal tmin than tmax in the usa under the rcp scenarios projecting future p trends was challenging as the magnitude and direction of seasonal and annual p change varied greatly across the gcms most of the gcms predicted declining or unchanged seasonal p trends while some gcms envisaged rising p tendencies however the gcm ensemble seasonal and annual p decreased relative to the baseline fig 4 contrary to higher seasonal climate warming future drying was pronounced at the annual scale seasonal p decline was notably higher for rcp 4 5 than rcp 8 5 while the annual p decline remained almost the same under the two rcps during both time slices on average a 45 53 and 30 53 decrease in seasonal p but 56 60 and 53 59 decrease in annual p was predicted by the end of the 21st century under rcp 4 5 and 8 5 respectively these climate trends could have major implications for future wheat production in punjab pakistan by affecting yield patterns irrigation scheduling driven by et rates growing season lengths and other factors and their interplay would also alter the future wp trends deryng et al 2016 kukal and irmak 2018 sultana et al 2009 we noted that the increase rates of both future tmax and tmin were noticeably higher in march in comparison to the other months of the season results not shown here this scenario can result in a substantially shortened grain filling duration hussain et al 2018 during which the wheat crop is most vulnerable to heat stress asseng et al 2011 during the baseline the wheat seasonal averaged tmax tmin and mean temperature tmean were 25 10 and 17 c respectively the critical temperature thresholds beyond which the wheat crop cannot survive are tmax 34 c and tmean 28 c asseng et al 2015 in our study only two gcms hadgem2 es and miroc5 projected the future seasonal warming beyond the temperature thresholds of wheat hence the gcm ensemble tmax and tmin rises were well under those temperature limits which suggests that the harmful effects of future climate warming on wheat production in our study area can be mitigated by avoiding the crop exposure to the mentioned warming extremes the projected drops in seasonal cumulative p could also have serious implications for irrigation water management of wheat in this area under the semi arid conditions of punjab 1 4 irrigations are applied during any particular wheat season and the recommended water depth during each irrigation is 75 mm khaliq et al 2019 unexpectedly longer dry spells with scarce rainfall incidents during future wheat seasons would require frequent irrigations with smaller water depths the combination of water deficit and tmean 30 c could rapidly deplete the soil moisture and enhance the root development in place of above ground biomass development and wheat yield schauberger et al 2017 3 2 climate change impact on wheat growth span ambient temperature is the key driver of crop phenological progress and its increase often corresponds to shortened growth spans due to rapid heat unit or gdd assimilations during crop growth stages consequently crops have less time for light interception and photosynthesis resulting in less biomass and yield asseng et al 2015 sultana et al 2009 at the study site the wheat growth span varied between 116 145 days average 130 days from 2004 to 2017 future wheat growth span variations relative to the baseline under the gcm ensemble climate for the two rcps and time slices are shown in fig 5 henceforth the term baseline refers to the 2004 2017 period for which the wheat experimental data were available wheat growth span variations from the baseline in response to individual gcm climate are also provided in fig s7 projected future climate warming shortened the mean and median wheat growth spans consistent with the warming trends of both time slices atmospheric co2 concentration had no impact on growth span reductions on average a growth span reduction of 4 16 and 8 16 days during the 2030s and 4 18 and 8 26 days during the 2060s was detected under rcp 4 5 and 8 5 respectively in other words wheat yield loss susceptibility would be notably higher during the 2060s than the 2030s especially under rcp 8 5 sultana et al 2009 also reported 12 14 days shrinkage in wheat growth span in response to climate warming of up to 5 c under the arid and semi arid conditions of pakistan schauberger et al 2017 predicted that for each degree rise in wheat seasonal tmean the growth span of wheat in the usa would reduce by 1 3 days we noted an intense wheat growth span decline rate in our study by end of 2080 the wheat seasonal tmean increased up to 2 4 c and 3 4 c at the rate of 0 23 and 0 41 c per decade significant at α 5 for rcp 4 5 and 8 5 respectively and the corresponding growth span decline rates were 3 3 and 4 0 days per c based on a simple linear regression analysis between the tmean and wheat growth span these results indicated higher probabilities of future wheat crop failure due to early maturity however climate change adaptation in the form of new varieties and careful re adjustments of sowing dates in the context of climate warming could counteract these climate change impacts 3 3 climate change impact on wheat yield the average wheat yield during the baseline was 4 6 t ha 1 fig 6 and table 1 show the projected wheat yield changes from the baseline during the 2030s and 2060s under the two rcps with and without the inclusion of co2 enrichment all the gcms confirmed that future wheat production in this area would face higher failure risks due to the climate change impacts fig s8 without the co2 enrichment moderate and severe declines in future wheat yields were projected during the 2030s and 2060s respectively during the 2030s the projected wheat yield decline averaged across the gcms was almost the same 10 15 for both rcps whereas during the 2060s it was 11 18 for rcp 4 5 and 11 20 for rcp 8 5 at the baseline co2 concentration level of 390 ppm fig 6 and table 1 by the end of 2080 the wheat yield decline rates were 2 0 and 2 10 per c in tmean under rcp 4 5 and 8 5 respectively similarly liu et al 2016 proposed regional and global wheat declines of 3 3 and 3 9 per degree celsius temperature rise these results indicated higher probabilities of future wheat crop failure due to early maturity in pakistan the optimum temperature range for wheat germination is 22 30 c while tmin and tmax thresholds are 2 and 32 c respectively a temperature rise beyond these limits hinders wheat development at 25 35 c smaller grains are produced due to shorter grain filling duration and above 30 c wheat yield declines because of slowed photosynthesis rates and rapid soil moisture depletion hussain et al 2018 schauberger et al 2017 we noted severe declines in future wheat yields at seasonal tmean 22 c with frequent days of tmax 30 c and tmin 12 c particularly at the start of growing season these warming conditions were mainly portrayed by miroc5 regardless of the rcp or time slice fig s9 for most gcms the projected climate warming was within the mentioned temperature ranges and the corresponding wheat yield declines were 25 35 in case of extreme climate warming such as projected by the hadgem2 es tmean tmax and tmin higher than 25 34 and 15 c respectively the wheat crop did not reach the anthesis and final yield was zero figs s8 and s9 similar wheat yield responses to future climate warming have been recorded by previous global scale studies asseng et al 2015 2011 liu et al 2019 distribution of climate warming among different months of the season also showed important implications wheat yield was more prone to failure in response to late season warming during the grain filling stages for instance the average seasonal warming projected by inmcm4 during the 2030s under rcp 8 5 was almost similar to the rest of the gcms except miroc5 and hadgem2 es but intense warming during february and march coinciding with the wheat grain filling stages resulted in higher yield declines fig s9 adopting and or developing wheat cultivars with longer grain filling duration could be a viable option to mitigate such late season climate warming impacts luo et al 2018 increasing the future co2 concentrations from 415 530 ppm under rcp 4 5 and 420 750 ppm under rcp 8 5 by the end of 2080 the corresponding negative climate warming impacts on wheat yield were partially and fully compensated under rcp 8 5 despite the severe warming wheat yield improvements 8 17 were detected during both slices fig 6 thus by doubling the co2 concentration up to 750 ppm under rcp 8 5 the beneficial co2 enrichment influences surpassed the negative climate warming impacts these deductions were consistent with global scale climate change impact assessments of the beneficial co2 concentration influences on future wheat yields carl friedrich et al 2018 deryng et al 2016 yang et al 2017a according to face experiments a 450 800 ppm co2 concentration rise would result in up to 9 increase in global wheat yield ainsworth and rogers 2007 in a meta analysis of 59 peer reviewed papers wang et al 2013 showed a 14 increase in wheat yield under face experimental conditions 3 4 climate change impacts on wheat water productivity wheat water demands in terms of cumulative seasonal et niwr and tw were also projected results not shown here and subsequently used to estimate the wheat wps and dwps during the baseline and future time slices due to growth span shortening the baseline average for et 285 mm and niwr 188 mm reduced during the 2030s and increased during the 2060s for both rcps this result indicated that despite a steeper growth span decline during the 2060s climate warming would accelerate the daily et rates resulting in a higher niwr during a fewer number of days for the ramc faisalabad site the baseline average for wpet wpirr and wptw was 1 52 2 42 and 1 57 kg m 3 respectively during 2001 2003 jehangir et al 2007 also produced similar wheat wp estimates from the field experiments conducted in this region the estimated wps were transformed into the dwps during the baseline and future time slices for average wheat growth span of 130 days during the baseline the corresponding wpet was transformed into the dwpet as 1 52 kg m3 130 days or simply 195 kg m 3 day similarly the estimated dwpirr and dwptw during the baseline were 309 and 200 kg m 3 day respectively future wheat wps and dwps variations from the baseline during the 2030s and 2060s are shown in fig 7 and table 1 wp and dwp variations from the baseline in response to individual gcm climate are also provided in fig s10 s15 at baseline co2 concentration the future wps and dwps mostly followed declining trends wpet and dwpet showed small the wpirr and dwpirr showed marginal and the dwptw showed strong declining tendencies for both rcps and time slices table 1 large negative changes in dwptw highlighted that in the future less wheat yield would be produced with the same amount of tw rainfall irrigation input or extra irrigation water would be required to maintain the wheat yield at the baseline level wheat wps and dwps improved under the enhanced co2 concentrations increments in baseline mean and median wps and dwps attributed to co2 enrichment were negligible during the 2030s but were prominent during the 2060s particularly under rcp 8 5 although co2 enrichment displayed noteworthy mitigation potential against climate warming the increments in mean and median wheat wps and dwps induced by higher co2 concentration were only prominent during the 2060s under rcp 8 5 while for the other cases they remained lower than the baseline average fig 7a d the interpretation is that limited co2 enrichment mitigation potential and future wheat yield loss compensation would come at the expense of additional water resources additionally the mean and median wpirr and dwpirr during the 2030s under elevated co2 concentrations of both rcps remained higher than the baseline fig 7a c because of the et and niwr decline caused by shorter growth spans under these conditions this apparent improvement did not necessarily mean more yields per unit of irrigation water usage as the changes in wptw and dwptw under the same conditions were still negative despite having similar trends of change the change magnitudes were different between the wps and dwps the consistently larger decrease magnitude in dwp than wp demonstrated that dwp was a more sensitive indicator of water use efficiency under climate change contrary to wp the dwp changed gradually in response to yield and co2 variations and also reduced exaggerated crop wp increments caused by co2 enrichment for example the 2030s wpirr showed a promising rise under rcp 4 5 enhanced co2 concentrations but for the same case the increase in 2030s dwpirr was limited fig 7a as a result dwp reduced the apparent wp increments instigated by the co2 enrichment therefore dwp is more suitable for capturing and providing realistically appropriate crop yield and water consumption relations under future climate change conditions generally crop wp is improved either by producing higher yields from the same water resources or by using less water resources to produce the same yields zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 in our study the wheat wps declined in future fig 7a even when the cumulative seasonal et and niwr reduced due to growth span shortening thus increasing the wheat yield production would be more important than increasing the water use efficiency for maintaining the wheat wps under future climate change threats yang et al 2016 also emphasized the importance of yield improvement for sustaining the rainfed wheat wp in australia furthermore the crop wp rises faster at lower yields and gradually slows down as the grain yield increases molden et al 2010 restricting the non consumptive water loss in the form of e and increasing the beneficial water use in the form of tr could also improve the crop wps ali and talukder 2008 kijne et al 2003 molden et al 2010 our projections showed that cumulative seasonal tr would decline while the corresponding e would increase at the same time regardless of et change behaviours across the rcps and time slices fig s16 and s17 the projected tr decline indicated that the wheat canopy development rates would be accelerated but the overall wheat cc would decline in our study area a linear and direct relationship exists between crop b production and tr but the drought and heat stress limit the opening of stomata which in turn results in tr decline accompanied by the reduction in overall b and yield production ali and talukder 2008 molden et al 2010 our results showed that future wheat wp could be conserved by adopting the strategies specifically aimed at reducing the field scale crop e rates such as deficit irrigation mulching improving soil structure through tillage operations to facilitate water extraction from deeper soil layers selecting breeding the high yielding and water efficient crops cultivars with higher hi and faster leaf expansion rates to shade the ground rapidly increased atmospheric co2 concentration generally results in increased wps owing to enhanced photosynthesis rate and declined stomatal conductance and tr ozturk et al 2017 various experimental studies recognize the ability of enhanced co2 concentration to improve photosynthesis rates yield and wps of c3 crops like wheat crops grown in semi arid water limited environments benefit the most from co2 enrichment effect deryng et al 2016 interaction mechanisms of co2 concentration with climate warming and the extents to which they both can nullify each other s impacts are not fully apprehended certain factors could limit the mitigation potential of co2 enrichment against future climate warming in case of prolonged exposure to elevated co2 concentration the photosynthesis stimulations and resulting positive yield and wp responses become negligible due to a phenomenon called co2 acclimation ozturk et al 2017 a nitrogen deficiency could hamper the leaf growth development resulting from positive contributions of the co2 enrichment this phenomenon not only restricts the expected yield improvement but also enhances the e rates ali and talukder 2008 ozturk et al 2017 besides the co2 enrichment effect is one of the most important uncertainty sources for future yield projections ainsworth and rogers 2007 deryng et al 2016 molden et al 2010 ozturk et al 2017 stöckle et al 2018 due to the lack of experimental data we were unable to analyse the factors limiting the mitigation potential of co2 enrichment in our study although in this study enhanced co2 concentrations showed promises to sustain and improve future wheat yields and wps in punjab the reliability of such estimates demands a further in depth examination of crop yield responses under field conditions it is often argued that detrimental warming impacts would surpass the beneficial co2 influences limiting its mitigation abilities deryng et al 2016 ozturk et al 2017 yang et al 2017b this study also concluded that enhanced co2 concentration could impart some beneficial influences but ultimately would be unable to eliminate the negative impacts of climate warming completely 4 conclusion the future climate constraints in sustaining and improving the wheat yield and water wp were identified specifically for the semi arid regions of punjab pakistan susceptibility to future wheat yield failure was mainly attributed to the climate warming threats featuring higher increase rates for tmin than tmax rampant incidences of seasonal and annual rainfall declines were also noticeable but contrary to notably higher seasonal warming future drying was pronounced at the annual scale a surge in climate warming accelerated the crop growth and the future wheat yield declined due to early maturity late season climate warming during the grain filling stage was the major cause of wheat yield failure adjusting the sowing dates to avoid wheat exposure to intense late season climate warming could be a viable mitigation option co2 enrichment partially mitigated the detrimental future climate warming impacts on wheat yields and wp but less yield production with the same or higher water consumption was detected without the co2 enrichment the wheat yield decline due to climate warming would surpass the possible yield gains attributed to co2 enrichment in semi arid regions of punjab pakistan the reliability of such estimates demands a further in depth examination of factors limiting the mitigation potential of co2 enrichment such as moisture availability and

10712,conceptualising wheat growth yield and water productivity wp relationships with future climate change is necessary for sustainable agriculture and food security this study assessed the climate change influences on wheat yield and wp with and without co2 enrichment under semi arid conditions statically bias corrected climate change projections were coupled with aquacrop model v5 0 to predict the wheat growth span yield and wp variations in punjab pakistan acute wheat seasonal warming characterised by sharp tmin increase than tmax and substantial rainfall drops lead to short growth spans and prompt ample yield reductions however co2 enrichment promises to offset the negative wheat yield trends higher wheat yield vulnerability was detected for the late season climate warming during the grain filling stage wheat yield reduction and the limited influence of beneficial co2 enrichment caused the future wp to decline consistently co2 enrichment featured a noteworthy mitigation role in sustaining and improving future wheat yield and wp in conclusion co2 enrichment could impart some beneficial influences to wheat yield and wp but would not fully eliminate the negative impacts of future climate warming under semi arid conditions of punjab pakistan the reliability of such estimates demands a further in depth examination of crop yield responses to carbon temperature water interactions under various field management conditions keywords climate change wheat yield water productivity semiarid condition 1 introduction anthropogenically forced climate warming led by increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases is reshaping the regional thermal and rainfall regimes besides contributing to increased frequencies of climate driven disasters like floods and droughts elevated co2 concentration in conjunction with other greenhouse gases like o3 is often regarded as the prime driver of climate warming which in turn is prompting crop yield declines across the globe asseng et al 2011 ozturk et al 2017 tao et al 2017 yang et al 2017a according to asseng et al 2015 global wheat yield could drop by 6 for each degree celsius temperature rise in the current mean global temperature schauberger et al 2017 concluded that each day 30 c temperature could cause maize soybean and wheat yield declines of up to 6 in the usa yang et al 2017b projected a 7 and 17 5 reduction in winter and spring wheat yields respectively caused by frequent heat stress events across china by the end of 2100 carl friedrich et al 2018 also predicted substantial losses in global yields of wheat soybean maize and rice for climate warming of 1 5 2 0 c however elevated co2 concentration despite being criticised for triggering climate warming has the potential to improve crop yield by enhancing photosynthesis rates and reducing water lost through transpiration particularly in c3 crops like wheat this phenomenon known as co2 enrichment has the capability of improving the crop water productivity wp an index of crop water use efficiency defined by the ratio of the crop yield and crop evapotranspiration co2 enrichment is well supported by various field experiments according to free air carbon enrichment face experiments an elevated co2 concentration of 450 800 ppm could enhance the crop yields up to 13 ainsworth and rogers 2007 all the aforementioned studies highlighting the negative climate warming impacts on crop yields also acknowledged the mitigation potential of co2 enrichment for maintaining or even improving the future yields and wp nonetheless the extents to which climate warming and co2 enrichment can nullify each other s impacts are not fully understood ainsworth and rogers 2007 deryng et al 2016 karimi et al 2017 li et al 2015 ozturk et al 2017 tao et al 2017 wang et al 2013 comprehending the crop yield and wp responses to such climate change trends is vital for the agriculture dependent economy of pakistan the country has already been listed among the worst climate struck and food insecure nations because of its over reliance on irrigated agriculture constantly diminishing river flows rapid population growth and low adaptive capacity abid et al 2016 khan et al 2016 in pakistan wheat is the staple crop as it makes up to 50 of the daily calorific intake but its yield and cultivation area have been dwindling since 2003 due to climate warming and water shortages in 2014 despite having a good wheat harvest 47 of the country s population faced food insecurity in pakistan wheat production primarily comes from irrigated agricultural lands lying under arid to semi arid conditions for which yield decline threats are very severe food security of the growing population of pakistan is relying on sustaining and or improving wheat production from these arid and semi arid lands facing the extreme climate variations ahmad et al 2004 2015 kirby et al 2017 rahman et al 2018 it is well documented that co2 enrichment has the highest mitigation potential against climate warming under water limited environments iqbal et al 2011 stöckle et al 2018 during a global scale analysis deryng et al 2016 found that positive influences of co2 enrichment on wheat yields and the consequential wp improvements were highest in arid climates specifically under rain fed conditions at the regional scale net advantages or disadvantages originating from the interplay between climate warming and co2 enrichment could vary dramatically sultana et al 2009 concluded that wheat would benefit the most from co2 enrichment under sub humid conditions of pakistan previous studies suggested that co2 enrichment would not withhold the declining wheat yield and wp trends under arid and semi arid conditions of pakistan prompting serious food security concerns it is expected that a 3 c rise by the 2050s would limit the per capita wheat availability to 84 kg per annum compared with the 198 kg per annum in 2012 hussain et al 2018 this work assessed the climate warming influences on wheat yield and wp with and without the inclusion of co2 enrichment the research outcomes contribute to the literature by identifying regional discrepancies related to the interaction between climate warming and co2 enrichment for irrigated wheat under semi arid conditions furthermore by projecting the attainable wheat yields and wp under climate driven constraints this study paves the path for policy makers and stakeholders to devise mitigation strategies addressing food security through sustainable wheat production under semi arid conditions of punjab pakistan 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area in pakistan punjab province is the main wheat producer regarding the yield and cultivation area the pakistan metrological department pmd has been monitoring the climate influences on crop yields such as wheat cotton and maize at the regional agro meteorological centre ramc experimental sites spread across the country we selected the ramc faisalabad site located in punjab fig 1 due to the availability of long term wheat experimental records at the study site the yield responses of eight wheat cultivars to climate variability were examined from 2004 to 2017 in faisalabad district wheat sowing starts from mid november to the end of december and harvesting lasts from mid march to mid april canal water is the main irrigation source as the poor quality groundwater is not suitable for crop production the climate is semi arid with more than 70 of the annual rainfall occurring from june to september during the wheat season the average maximum and minimum temperatures ranges were 23 27 and 3 8 c respectively whereas the cumulative seasonal rainfall varied from 85 to 210 mm well drained sandy clay loam is the dominant soil texture in this area iqbal et al 2011 khan et al 2015 out of 13 consecutive wheat seasons data 11 seasons excluding 2011 2012 and 2013 2014 seasons were available and during each season nine distinct growth stages were recorded at the study site inter seasonal variations of lengths of the growth stages and cumulative heat units expressed as growing degree days gdd along with additional experimental details monitored at the study site are provided in table s1 and s2 and figs s1 and s2 2 2 future climate change projection future climate change projections were derived from the outputs of nine global circulation models gcms listed in table s3 the gcms were selected based on their ability to represent the climate of south asian countries like pakistan india and china biemans et al 2013 chaudhuri and srivastava 2017 hasson et al 2016 lutz et al 2016 mcsweeney et al 2015 ruane and mcdermid 2017 sharmila et al 2015 sooraj et al 2015 su et al 2016 daily gcm outputs of

required for the agricultural impact assessment studies quantile mapping qm is a commonly followed procedure to reduce biases in gcm historic simulations by mapping the cumulative distribution function cdf of a certain variable over cdf of the same variable in observed time series the same empirical cdfs are then applied over the gcm projected future time series details about underlying principals limitations and extensions of the qm and its comparison with other approaches have been extensively discussed in the literature ahmed et al 2013 chen et al 2011 chiyuan et al 2014 ehret et

data for the baseline period of 1980 2010 including tmax tmin relative humidity u2 rn and p were collected from the pmd for the weather station located in the study area the qm procedure was applied at the daily time step to statistically bias correct the gcm outputs of six major climate variables during the baseline period as well as during the 2030s and 2060s the cdfs of the gcm ensemble of the daily tmax tmin and p before and after the qm application are presented in fig s3 bias corrected results of annual tmax tmin and p for each gcm during the baseline period are also shown in fig s4 2 3 crop modelling the food and agriculture organisation fao developed the water driven aquacrop model to compute biomass and yield as a function of crop transpiration while maintaining a balance between robustness simplicity and accuracy heng et al 2009 hsiao et al 2009 raes et al 2009 steduto et al 2009 in this study the aquacrop model v5 0 was used to simulate the soil water balance wheat growth and yield production process aquacrop uses the canopy cover cc in place of the leaf area index to determine the actual crop evapotranspiration et by performing a daily water balance based on the water fluxes entering and leaving the soil in the crop root zone at a daily time step the et is further subdivided into the transpiration tr and evaporation e components depending on the atmospheric evaporative demands in the form of reference crop evapotranspiration eto cc and soil moisture as follows heng et al 2009 hsiao et al 2009 raes et al 2009 steduto et al 2009 1 e t e t r 2 e k r k e x 1 c c e t o 3 t r k s k c t r x c c e t o where k r is the evaporation reduction coefficient 0 1 with a small value indicating the insufficient soil moisture in the top 30 cm layer relative to the eto k e x is the maximum soil evaporation coefficient for a fully wet and non shaded surface c c is the actual crop canopy cover adjusted for the micro advective effects k s is the water stress coefficient being equal to 1 and 0 at the field capacity and permanent wilting point respectively and k c t r x is the maximum basal crop coefficient when cc 100 aquacrop computes the above ground biomass b as a product of the seasonal cumulative t r and crop wp normalised for the eto and atmospheric co2 concentration adopting the wp makes the aquacrop applicable to a variety of crops grown at diverse locations under contrasting climate and management regimes the harvestable proportion of the b is the final crop yield which is estimated from the product of b and the crop specific harvest index hi aquacrop has been extensively used for evaluating various crop management practices such as deficit irrigation and projecting future climate change impacts for a variety of crops and climate conditions iqbal et al 2014 paredes et al 2015 toumi et al 2016 xiangxiang et al 2013 yang et al 2017b detailed discussions about the model s working principals can be found in the literature chukalla et al 2015 heng et al 2009 hsiao et al 2009 raes et al 2009 steduto et al 2009 2 3 1 model calibration and validation aquacrop was calibrated for wheat yield growing season length gdds accumulated during the growing season and the soil moisture contents the experimental data collected during eight wheat seasons 2004 2013 were used for model calibration and the validation was conducted for the last three wheat seasons 2014 2017 only 6 of the 11 wheat seasons included the measured moisture contents for a soil depth of 0 90 cm during the validation phase the crop parameters obtained from the model calibration were used to evaluate the simulated wheat yield growing season length soil moisture contents and gdds accumulated during the growing season to run a single simulation aquacrop requires the atmosphere plant soil components in six distinct user defined input files climate file crop file soil file irrigation file management file and the initial soil moisture status iqbal et al 2014 toumi et al 2016 many of the aquacrop inputs particularly those defining the management impacts on crop growth and final yield are termed conservative inputs implying that these would remain constant or change little with time geographic location cultivar or crop management for model calibration we referenced these conservative input parameters for wheat from previous experimental and aquacrop sensitivity analyses studies iqbal et al 2014 jin et al 2018 toumi et al 2016 xiangxiang et al 2013 xing et al 2017 to replicate the crop canopy development and growth processes aquacrop also requires the cultivar specific non conservative inputs which must be collected from the field including days to emergence days to maximum canopy cover days to senescence days to maturity initial canopy cover cco canopy growth coefficient cgc canopy decline coefficient cdc and maximum effective root depths we collected the non conservative inputs from the field experiments conducted in 2004 2017 the number of days and heat units gdd of various growth stages recorded at the study site were not in the model required format therefore we considered that recorded gdds from sowing to emergence heading flowering milk maturity and full maturity were equal to the phenological dates of emergence maximum canopy cover flowering the onset of senescence and harvesting respectively fig s1 among the remaining non conservative inputs the cco was automatically estimated by the aquacrop depending on the seed rate table s2 while the cgc and cdc were adjusted within the fao proposed ranges using a trial and error approach to minimise the differences between the simulation and the observed data thus by fixing the conservative inputs and adjusting the non conservative inputs we calibrated the aquacrop model for each cultivar from 2004 to 2013 for model validation the average non conservative inputs obtained from the model calibration were used table s5 lists these conservative and averaged non conservative inputs the model was run again with table s5 inputs for the validation period and the simulation results were compared with the observed data figs s5 and s6 present the aquacrop performance during the calibration and validation period respectively evaluated based on the nash sutcliffe efficiency root mean square error normalised root mean square error and index of agreement greaves and wang 2016 paredes et al 2015 toumi et al 2016 2 3 2 model revalidation in addition to the field scale calibration and validation a regional scale revalidation of aquacrop was also performed for district faisalabad based on the 17 year 2000 2017 statistical wheat yield data collected from the crop reporting service database government of punjab pakistan http www crs agripunjab gov pk according to a 2011 survey conducted across 23 districts including faisalabad sehar 2006 was the most popular wheat cultivar planted by over 67 of the sampled farmers in the irrigated punjab battese et al 2014 for the study site the field data for sehar 2006 was available during the 2007 2008 and 2008 2009 seasons table s2 the revalidation was conducted for wheat yield using the same input parameters obtained during the aquacrop calibration specifically for sehar 2006 to gauge the cultivar specific field scale model calibration fig s7 presents the revalidation outcomes which suggest that our model calibration approach was successful aquacrop showed a fairly acceptable ability to simulate the regional wheat yield indicating that the calibrated model can be used reliably in assessing climate change impacts 2 3 3 simulation runs table s5 inputs were combined with the bias corrected climate change projection from the gcms to simulate wheat yield during the 2030s and 2060s for future wheat yield simulations the sowing date was fixed as 20 november and the aquacrop irrigation module generated an automatic irrigation schedule with no water stress irrigation was set to trigger when 50 of the total available water in the soil has been depleted temperature rainfall and the atmospheric co2 concentration are the key determinants of crop yield responses to future climate change previous experimental evidence suggested that co2 enrichment could mitigate the climate warming threats of crop yield reduction the probable increases in baseline co2 concentrations for rcp 4 5 and 8 5 included in this study to detect the beneficial co2 enrichment influences were referenced from the literature and are shown in table s4 ainsworth and rogers 2007 asseng et al 2013 2015 carl friedrich et al 2018 deryng et al 2016 ozturk et al 2017 tao et al 2017 to discern the potential beneficial influences of co2 enrichment two simulation sets were run with the first accounting for only the climate variations while keeping the co2 concentrations at the baseline level and the second accounting for the combined effect of climate variations and elevated co2 concentrations apart from wheat yield and et net irrigation water requirements niwr were also simulated for future climate change scenarios with and without the inclusion of co2 enrichment effects 2 4 wheat water productivity crop wp or simply wp referring to crop yield produced per unit of freshwater kg m 3 used in the form of et irrigation or total water irrigation rainfall is an indicator of efficient agricultural water usage crop wp can be further categorised as yield per unit of water lost as et wpet yield per unit of irrigation water applied wpirr and yield per unit of total water wptw use mathematically the wps can be expressed as the following equations bastiaanssen and steduto 2017 kijne et al 2003 4 w p e t y i e l d k g h a 1 e t m 3 h a 1 5 w p i r r y i e l d k g h a 1 i r r i g a t i o n m 3 h a 1 6 w p t w y i e l d k g h a 1 t o t a l w a t e r u s e m 3 h a 1 shortened crop growth spans and fewer seasonal rainfalls are expected to prevail in the future due to climate warming asseng et al 2011 2015 thus the seasonal cumulative rainwater supply crop et and niwr would also decline but the daily et rates irrigation and rainwater consumption would increase at the same time acharjee et al 2017 conventionally eq 4 6 are used to estimate the crop wps djaman et al 2018 kahlown et al 2007 as the ratio between crop yield and the sum of et irrigation or tw consumption during the crop growth span the overall decline in seasonal cumulative et niwr or tw usage due to growth span shortening could result in higher crop wps but these values would be of little interest if not associated with improved crop yields ali and talukder 2008 to account for the mentioned disparities in the daily and seasonal et irrigation and tw usage behaviours a modified version of wp daily water productivity dwp was adopted as a performance indicator of wheat water use efficiency under climate change contrary to the conventional wps which describe the crop yield achieved at the expense of seasonal cumulative et irrigation or tw use the dwp kg m 3 day describes the final crop yield achieved with reference to the daily consumption rates of the et irrigation and tw during the crop growth span yang et al 2017b for example dwpet was estimated by dividing yield with the ratio of seasonal cumulative evapotranspiration et and growing season length in days similarly the dwpirr and dwptw were also calculated yang et al 2017b in addition to the crop yield and seasonal water usage the dwp also incorporates the daily distribution of rainfall et irrigation and tw consumption during the crop growth span differences between conventionally estimated wps and dwps were also computed to access the suitability of the proposed metric for gauging the climate change impacts 3 results and discussion 3 1 projected future climate change mean median and variability of gcm projected seasonal and annual tmax tmin and p after bias correction are shown in figs 2 4 all the gcms interpreted that the study area would progressively become hotter and drier by the end of the 21st century acute seasonal warming characterised by sharp tmin rising tendencies relative to tmax were projected for wheat under both rcps and time slices rasul et al 2012 also reported that during the last 30 years the tmin was rising at a higher pace than tmax across the indus basin of pakistan compared with the baseline 1980 2010 wheat seasonal tmax and tmin increments averaged across nine gcms for rcp 4 5 were 1 9 2 3 and 2 0 2 5 c respectively while under rcp 8 5 these were 2 2 3 3 and 2 5 3 5 c respectively by the end of 2080 similarly annual tmax and tmin increments of 1 0 2 0 and 1 5 2 5 c for rcp 4 5 and 1 5 2 7 and 1 9 3 0 c for rcp 8 5 were shown by the end of the 21st century figs 2 and 3 future climate projections suggested that wheat seasonal warming would be higher than annual warming these projections were reinforced by the gradual incline detected in wheat seasonal average temperature during the last 30 years across most weather stations in pakistan ahmad and choi 2018 ahmad et al 2014 iqbal et al 2016 trends and magnitudes of climate warming projected in our study were also confirmed by studies predicting the early middle and late 21st century climate of pakistan hussain et al 2018 iqbal et al 2011 islam et al 2009 karimi et al 2018 projected a higher increase in wheat seasonal tmin than tmax in the usa under the rcp scenarios projecting future p trends was challenging as the magnitude and direction of seasonal and annual p change varied greatly across the gcms most of the gcms predicted declining or unchanged seasonal p trends while some gcms envisaged rising p tendencies however the gcm ensemble seasonal and annual p decreased relative to the baseline fig 4 contrary to higher seasonal climate warming future drying was pronounced at the annual scale seasonal p decline was notably higher for rcp 4 5 than rcp 8 5 while the annual p decline remained almost the same under the two rcps during both time slices on average a 45 53 and 30 53 decrease in seasonal p but 56 60 and 53 59 decrease in annual p was predicted by the end of the 21st century under rcp 4 5 and 8 5 respectively these climate trends could have major implications for future wheat production in punjab pakistan by affecting yield patterns irrigation scheduling driven by et rates growing season lengths and other factors and their interplay would also alter the future wp trends deryng et al 2016 kukal and irmak 2018 sultana et al 2009 we noted that the increase rates of both future tmax and tmin were noticeably higher in march in comparison to the other months of the season results not shown here this scenario can result in a substantially shortened grain filling duration hussain et al 2018 during which the wheat crop is most vulnerable to heat stress asseng et al 2011 during the baseline the wheat seasonal averaged tmax tmin and mean temperature tmean were 25 10 and 17 c respectively the critical temperature thresholds beyond which the wheat crop cannot survive are tmax 34 c and tmean 28 c asseng et al 2015 in our study only two gcms hadgem2 es and miroc5 projected the future seasonal warming beyond the temperature thresholds of wheat hence the gcm ensemble tmax and tmin rises were well under those temperature limits which suggests that the harmful effects of future climate warming on wheat production in our study area can be mitigated by avoiding the crop exposure to the mentioned warming extremes the projected drops in seasonal cumulative p could also have serious implications for irrigation water management of wheat in this area under the semi arid conditions of punjab 1 4 irrigations are applied during any particular wheat season and the recommended water depth during each irrigation is 75 mm khaliq et al 2019 unexpectedly longer dry spells with scarce rainfall incidents during future wheat seasons would require frequent irrigations with smaller water depths the combination of water deficit and tmean 30 c could rapidly deplete the soil moisture and enhance the root development in place of above ground biomass development and wheat yield schauberger et al 2017 3 2 climate change impact on wheat growth span ambient temperature is the key driver of crop phenological progress and its increase often corresponds to shortened growth spans due to rapid heat unit or gdd assimilations during crop growth stages consequently crops have less time for light interception and photosynthesis resulting in less biomass and yield asseng et al 2015 sultana et al 2009 at the study site the wheat growth span varied between 116 145 days average 130 days from 2004 to 2017 future wheat growth span variations relative to the baseline under the gcm ensemble climate for the two rcps and time slices are shown in fig 5 henceforth the term baseline refers to the 2004 2017 period for which the wheat experimental data were available wheat growth span variations from the baseline in response to individual gcm climate are also provided in fig s7 projected future climate warming shortened the mean and median wheat growth spans consistent with the warming trends of both time slices atmospheric co2 concentration had no impact on growth span reductions on average a growth span reduction of 4 16 and 8 16 days during the 2030s and 4 18 and 8 26 days during the 2060s was detected under rcp 4 5 and 8 5 respectively in other words wheat yield loss susceptibility would be notably higher during the 2060s than the 2030s especially under rcp 8 5 sultana et al 2009 also reported 12 14 days shrinkage in wheat growth span in response to climate warming of up to 5 c under the arid and semi arid conditions of pakistan schauberger et al 2017 predicted that for each degree rise in wheat seasonal tmean the growth span of wheat in the usa would reduce by 1 3 days we noted an intense wheat growth span decline rate in our study by end of 2080 the wheat seasonal tmean increased up to 2 4 c and 3 4 c at the rate of 0 23 and 0 41 c per decade significant at α 5 for rcp 4 5 and 8 5 respectively and the corresponding growth span decline rates were 3 3 and 4 0 days per c based on a simple linear regression analysis between the tmean and wheat growth span these results indicated higher probabilities of future wheat crop failure due to early maturity however climate change adaptation in the form of new varieties and careful re adjustments of sowing dates in the context of climate warming could counteract these climate change impacts 3 3 climate change impact on wheat yield the average wheat yield during the baseline was 4 6 t ha 1 fig 6 and table 1 show the projected wheat yield changes from the baseline during the 2030s and 2060s under the two rcps with and without the inclusion of co2 enrichment all the gcms confirmed that future wheat production in this area would face higher failure risks due to the climate change impacts fig s8 without the co2 enrichment moderate and severe declines in future wheat yields were projected during the 2030s and 2060s respectively during the 2030s the projected wheat yield decline averaged across the gcms was almost the same 10 15 for both rcps whereas during the 2060s it was 11 18 for rcp 4 5 and 11 20 for rcp 8 5 at the baseline co2 concentration level of 390 ppm fig 6 and table 1 by the end of 2080 the wheat yield decline rates were 2 0 and 2 10 per c in tmean under rcp 4 5 and 8 5 respectively similarly liu et al 2016 proposed regional and global wheat declines of 3 3 and 3 9 per degree celsius temperature rise these results indicated higher probabilities of future wheat crop failure due to early maturity in pakistan the optimum temperature range for wheat germination is 22 30 c while tmin and tmax thresholds are 2 and 32 c respectively a temperature rise beyond these limits hinders wheat development at 25 35 c smaller grains are produced due to shorter grain filling duration and above 30 c wheat yield declines because of slowed photosynthesis rates and rapid soil moisture depletion hussain et al 2018 schauberger et al 2017 we noted severe declines in future wheat yields at seasonal tmean 22 c with frequent days of tmax 30 c and tmin 12 c particularly at the start of growing season these warming conditions were mainly portrayed by miroc5 regardless of the rcp or time slice fig s9 for most gcms the projected climate warming was within the mentioned temperature ranges and the corresponding wheat yield declines were 25 35 in case of extreme climate warming such as projected by the hadgem2 es tmean tmax and tmin higher than 25 34 and 15 c respectively the wheat crop did not reach the anthesis and final yield was zero figs s8 and s9 similar wheat yield responses to future climate warming have been recorded by previous global scale studies asseng et al 2015 2011 liu et al 2019 distribution of climate warming among different months of the season also showed important implications wheat yield was more prone to failure in response to late season warming during the grain filling stages for instance the average seasonal warming projected by inmcm4 during the 2030s under rcp 8 5 was almost similar to the rest of the gcms except miroc5 and hadgem2 es but intense warming during february and march coinciding with the wheat grain filling stages resulted in higher yield declines fig s9 adopting and or developing wheat cultivars with longer grain filling duration could be a viable option to mitigate such late season climate warming impacts luo et al 2018 increasing the future co2 concentrations from 415 530 ppm under rcp 4 5 and 420 750 ppm under rcp 8 5 by the end of 2080 the corresponding negative climate warming impacts on wheat yield were partially and fully compensated under rcp 8 5 despite the severe warming wheat yield improvements 8 17 were detected during both slices fig 6 thus by doubling the co2 concentration up to 750 ppm under rcp 8 5 the beneficial co2 enrichment influences surpassed the negative climate warming impacts these deductions were consistent with global scale climate change impact assessments of the beneficial co2 concentration influences on future wheat yields carl friedrich et al 2018 deryng et al 2016 yang et al 2017a according to face experiments a 450 800 ppm co2 concentration rise would result in up to 9 increase in global wheat yield ainsworth and rogers 2007 in a meta analysis of 59 peer reviewed papers wang et al 2013 showed a 14 increase in wheat yield under face experimental conditions 3 4 climate change impacts on wheat water productivity wheat water demands in terms of cumulative seasonal et niwr and tw were also projected results not shown here and subsequently used to estimate the wheat wps and dwps during the baseline and future time slices due to growth span shortening the baseline average for et 285 mm and niwr 188 mm reduced during the 2030s and increased during the 2060s for both rcps this result indicated that despite a steeper growth span decline during the 2060s climate warming would accelerate the daily et rates resulting in a higher niwr during a fewer number of days for the ramc faisalabad site the baseline average for wpet wpirr and wptw was 1 52 2 42 and 1 57 kg m 3 respectively during 2001 2003 jehangir et al 2007 also produced similar wheat wp estimates from the field experiments conducted in this region the estimated wps were transformed into the dwps during the baseline and future time slices for average wheat growth span of 130 days during the baseline the corresponding wpet was transformed into the dwpet as 1 52 kg m3 130 days or simply 195 kg m 3 day similarly the estimated dwpirr and dwptw during the baseline were 309 and 200 kg m 3 day respectively future wheat wps and dwps variations from the baseline during the 2030s and 2060s are shown in fig 7 and table 1 wp and dwp variations from the baseline in response to individual gcm climate are also provided in fig s10 s15 at baseline co2 concentration the future wps and dwps mostly followed declining trends wpet and dwpet showed small the wpirr and dwpirr showed marginal and the dwptw showed strong declining tendencies for both rcps and time slices table 1 large negative changes in dwptw highlighted that in the future less wheat yield would be produced with the same amount of tw rainfall irrigation input or extra irrigation water would be required to maintain the wheat yield at the baseline level wheat wps and dwps improved under the enhanced co2 concentrations increments in baseline mean and median wps and dwps attributed to co2 enrichment were negligible during the 2030s but were prominent during the 2060s particularly under rcp 8 5 although co2 enrichment displayed noteworthy mitigation potential against climate warming the increments in mean and median wheat wps and dwps induced by higher co2 concentration were only prominent during the 2060s under rcp 8 5 while for the other cases they remained lower than the baseline average fig 7a d the interpretation is that limited co2 enrichment mitigation potential and future wheat yield loss compensation would come at the expense of additional water resources additionally the mean and median wpirr and dwpirr during the 2030s under elevated co2 concentrations of both rcps remained higher than the baseline fig 7a c because of the et and niwr decline caused by shorter growth spans under these conditions this apparent improvement did not necessarily mean more yields per unit of irrigation water usage as the changes in wptw and dwptw under the same conditions were still negative despite having similar trends of change the change magnitudes were different between the wps and dwps the consistently larger decrease magnitude in dwp than wp demonstrated that dwp was a more sensitive indicator of water use efficiency under climate change contrary to wp the dwp changed gradually in response to yield and co2 variations and also reduced exaggerated crop wp increments caused by co2 enrichment for example the 2030s wpirr showed a promising rise under rcp 4 5 enhanced co2 concentrations but for the same case the increase in 2030s dwpirr was limited fig 7a as a result dwp reduced the apparent wp increments instigated by the co2 enrichment therefore dwp is more suitable for capturing and providing realistically appropriate crop yield and water consumption relations under future climate change conditions generally crop wp is improved either by producing higher yields from the same water resources or by using less water resources to produce the same yields zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 in our study the wheat wps declined in future fig 7a even when the cumulative seasonal et and niwr reduced due to growth span shortening thus increasing the wheat yield production would be more important than increasing the water use efficiency for maintaining the wheat wps under future climate change threats yang et al 2016 also emphasized the importance of yield improvement for sustaining the rainfed wheat wp in australia furthermore the crop wp rises faster at lower yields and gradually slows down as the grain yield increases molden et al 2010 restricting the non consumptive water loss in the form of e and increasing the beneficial water use in the form of tr could also improve the crop wps ali and talukder 2008 kijne et al 2003 molden et al 2010 our projections showed that cumulative seasonal tr would decline while the corresponding e would increase at the same time regardless of et change behaviours across the rcps and time slices fig s16 and s17 the projected tr decline indicated that the wheat canopy development rates would be accelerated but the overall wheat cc would decline in our study area a linear and direct relationship exists between crop b production and tr but the drought and heat stress limit the opening of stomata which in turn results in tr decline accompanied by the reduction in overall b and yield production ali and talukder 2008 molden et al 2010 our results showed that future wheat wp could be conserved by adopting the strategies specifically aimed at reducing the field scale crop e rates such as deficit irrigation mulching improving soil structure through tillage operations to facilitate water extraction from deeper soil layers selecting breeding the high yielding and water efficient crops cultivars with higher hi and faster leaf expansion rates to shade the ground rapidly increased atmospheric co2 concentration generally results in increased wps owing to enhanced photosynthesis rate and declined stomatal conductance and tr ozturk et al 2017 various experimental studies recognize the ability of enhanced co2 concentration to improve photosynthesis rates yield and wps of c3 crops like wheat crops grown in semi arid water limited environments benefit the most from co2 enrichment effect deryng et al 2016 interaction mechanisms of co2 concentration with climate warming and the extents to which they both can nullify each other s impacts are not fully apprehended certain factors could limit the mitigation potential of co2 enrichment against future climate warming in case of prolonged exposure to elevated co2 concentration the photosynthesis stimulations and resulting positive yield and wp responses become negligible due to a phenomenon called co2 acclimation ozturk et al 2017 a nitrogen deficiency could hamper the leaf growth development resulting from positive contributions of the co2 enrichment this phenomenon not only restricts the expected yield improvement but also enhances the e rates ali and talukder 2008 ozturk et al 2017 besides the co2 enrichment effect is one of the most important uncertainty sources for future yield projections ainsworth and rogers 2007 deryng et al 2016 molden et al 2010 ozturk et al 2017 stöckle et al 2018 due to the lack of experimental data we were unable to analyse the factors limiting the mitigation potential of co2 enrichment in our study although in this study enhanced co2 concentrations showed promises to sustain and improve future wheat yields and wps in punjab the reliability of such estimates demands a further in depth examination of crop yield responses under field conditions it is often argued that detrimental warming impacts would surpass the beneficial co2 influences limiting its mitigation abilities deryng et al 2016 ozturk et al 2017 yang et al 2017b this study also concluded that enhanced co2 concentration could impart some beneficial influences but ultimately would be unable to eliminate the negative impacts of climate warming completely 4 conclusion the future climate constraints in sustaining and improving the wheat yield and water wp were identified specifically for the semi arid regions of punjab pakistan susceptibility to future wheat yield failure was mainly attributed to the climate warming threats featuring higher increase rates for tmin than tmax rampant incidences of seasonal and annual rainfall declines were also noticeable but contrary to notably higher seasonal warming future drying was pronounced at the annual scale a surge in climate warming accelerated the crop growth and the future wheat yield declined due to early maturity late season climate warming during the grain filling stage was the major cause of wheat yield failure adjusting the sowing dates to avoid wheat exposure to intense late season climate warming could be a viable mitigation option co2 enrichment partially mitigated the detrimental future climate warming impacts on wheat yields and wp but less yield production with the same or higher water consumption was detected without the co2 enrichment the wheat yield decline due to climate warming would surpass the possible yield gains attributed to co2 enrichment in semi arid regions of punjab pakistan the reliability of such estimates demands a further in depth examination of factors limiting the mitigation potential of co2 enrichment such as moisture availability and

10713,field irrigation water management depends on interactions among crop yield soil water salt and groundwater salt in arid irrigation area with shallow saline groundwater this paper presents a novel uncertainty simulation optimization framework for irrigation water allocation and sustainable agricultural environment which integrates simulation of physical processes of soil groundwater water and salt balance into an uncertainty based optimization model the impacts of crop evapotranspiration soil water and salt and groundwater levels are interactively involved in the simulation model uncertainties economic and crop parameters available water amount presented as fuzzy boundary intervals and probability distribution functions are considered in the optimization model this field irrigation water allocation framework emphasizes the role of field soil water and salt movement processes to decision making of irrigation water allocation then the proposed simulation optimization framework was applied to a case study in the hetao irrigation district an arid area of northwest china where soil salinity is a serious environmental problem induced by irrigation and shallow groundwater therefore optimal irrigation water allocation solutions can be generated for providing decision makers with reliable decision options where the maximum system benefits resulting from sustainable agricultural production are desired furthermore the results can support analysis of interrelationships among system benefits water allocation planning and groundwater depth soil salt content constraints scenario analysis groundwater table depth gtd 1 1 5 2 2 5 3 m and no groundwater exchange consideration showed that the maximum net benefit could be 27469 44818 yuan with the groundwater table depth of 1 5 m also the irrigation water allocation changed when the salt constraint was considered which indicates that the results obtained by the developed framework can alleviate soil salinization to a certain degree therefore this framework can provide more effective information for the irrigation water management and soil salinization control which is meaningful for the sustainable development of irrigation agriculture keywords irrigation optimization field water and salt processes shallow groundwater salinity uncertainty 1 introduction in arid and semi arid lands agricultural crop production faces two significant problems namely water resources shortage and soil salinity sepaskhah and falakdehia 2009 specifically more than 30 of the irrigated lands in arid and semi arid areas are affected by soil salinity li et al 2014 asfaw et al 2018 which is a serious threat to crop production the sustainable planning and management of irrigation water resources plays a critical role in food security and sustainable agro ecosystems tilman et al 2002 kang et al 2017 furthermore improving irrigation schedule is important to ensure crops to satisfy their irrigation water demand with limited irrigation water resources kourgialas et al 2019 therefore it is significant to optimize irrigation water allocation especially in arid areas with serious water shortages and soil salinity problems in the past decades some studies have been carried out on the optimization of irrigation water resources including traditional optimization methods and inexact or uncertain optimization models kumar et al 2006 soundharajan and sudheer 2009 karamouz et al 2010 prasad et al 2011 mirajkar and patel 2016 zhang and guo 2018 however most studies merely consider simple agro hydrological process in fact both soil water flow and salt physical movement processes are important factors to determine irrigation water allocation because such a dynamic water and salt condition within the root zone influences the total available soil water in the root zone recently some studies have generally focused on irrigation water management integrating the optimization and water cycle process simulation model yu and shang 2016 and wen et al 2017 used a simulation optimization model by integrating water balance model crop water production function and optimization model for analyzing optimal irrigation schedule these models used the field water balance model to simulate the change of soil water content but contribution of shallow groundwater to crop water requirement had not been considered moreover in some arid irrigation areas with shallow groundwater level there is a strong and frequent water exchange between soil water and groundwater ayars and schoneman 2006 xue et al 2018 thus the effects of groundwater on crop yields cannot be ignored farahani et al 2009 awan 2010 for example alizadeh and mousavi 2013 tried to optimize irrigation water allocation in a shallow groundwater region by a random soil water and salt dynamics this method could not capture the physic processes of water exchange between soil water and groundwater akhtar et al 2013 used aquacrop model and hydrus 1d model to optimize deficit irrigation scheduling under shallow groundwater conditions but it wasn t aware of soil salinity problem moreover soil salinity will increase at the end of crop growth period because of high evapotranspiration to guarantee sustainable development of irrigation agriculture controlling the soil salinity at the end of crop growth period should be considered when determining irrigation planning furthermore it is noted that irrigation water allocation is more complicated due to some uncertain factors such as climate condition water demand market situation brink et al 2008 regulwar and gurav 2011 chen et al 2019 some inexact optimization methods have been used for irrigation water allocation yoshihide et al 2013 liu et al 2017b li et al 2018 among the most used uncertain methods chance constrained programming ccp can deal with stochastic uncertainty i e uncertain parameters expressed as probabilistic distribution functions in the irrigation water management system and tackle the risk of violating constraints charnes and cooper 1959 maqsood and huang 2003 gu et al 2012 zhang et al 2019 interval mathematical programming imp can effectively deal with uncertain parameters expressed as intervals with lower and upper bounds but with unknown distribution information huang et al 1992 therefore it is more thorough for irrigation water allocation to introduce inexact approach thus reflecting the real world complexity of irrigation management however only few of the research paid attention to simulation based uncertain optimization model for irrigation water allocation aiming to sustainable irrigation water management in arid area with shallow saline groundwater the objective of this study is to 1 propose a simulation optimization framework under uncertainty for optimal irrigation water allocation which integrates an agro hydrological simulation model and an uncertain optimization model 2 explore the impact of shallow groundwater conditions and soil salt content constraint on the optimization results of irrigation water allocation 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the hetao irrigation district hid one of the three largest irrigation districts in china is located in inner mongolia northwestern china 40 19 41 18 n 106 20 109 19 e altitude 1039 m fig 1 the district covers an area of 11 200 km2 and has irrigation area of 5700 km2 maize sunflower and wheat are the main crops accounting for 85 of the total cultivated land in the study area gao et al 2018 traditional irrigation methods are mostly adopted and crop planting pattern is fragmentary it s a typical arid and semi arid area with an average annual precipitation from 130 mm to 220 mm and evaporation from 2000 mm to 2500 mm 20 cm pan jia et al 2017 irrigation is therefore a necessary measure for crop growth and agricultural production the groundwater level is shallow varying from 1 m to 3 m the soil is thus suffering from widespread salinity problem in the region liu et al 2017a chemical composition of groundwater salinity is mainly composed of nacl kcl and caso4 xue et al 2018 most of the irrigation water comes from the yellow river with salinity of 0 5 g l because the yellow river carries a lot of sediment and minerals wu et al 2008 thus a large amount of salt is delivered to the hid because the annual diverted water volume is about 5 billion m3 therefore soil salinization is a severe problem which is the main reason for restricting agricultural production in the irrigated area 2 2 uncertain simulation optimization framework for irrigation water allocation field water flow and salt movement processes simulation model and inexact irrigation water optimization allocation model are coupled to obtain the irrigation water allocation solutions under different crop growth stages of three typical crops maize sunflower and wheat fig 2 maize is planted in april and harvested in september sunflower is planted in may and harvested in september and wheat is planted in march and harvested in july field scale water and salt balance model is used to describe the physical processes of soil water and salt dynamics affected by irrigation and shallow groundwater level crop actual evapotranspiration is estimated based on a daily soil water and salinity content furthermore crop yield can be calculated by the jensen model jensen 1968 which is a crop yield water consumption relationship the optimal irrigation amount decision variable at growth stages for crops can be achieved by the inexact optimization model with the objective of maximizing irrigation system net benefit meanwhile outputs irrigation amount of the optimization model have feedbacks to the water and salt balance module of simulation model soil salt threshold at crop harvest is a constraint in the optimization model the simulation model is used to simulate the crop yield soil salt and groundwater depth for the optimization model after that crop water flow and salt movement model were coupled into the irrigation decision making model 2 2 1 simulation model considering field water flow and salt movement process actual crop evapotranspiration is affected by root zone water and salinity stress generally crop actual evapotranspiration eta is considered to decrease when the electrical conductivity of the soil saturation extract ece is higher than the threshold ecet crop evapotranspiration under water and salt stress is calculated by following formulas allen et al 1998 and domíngueza et al 2011 1a e t

groundwater u and actual evapotranspiration eta in this study surface runoff was ignored because of low rainfall and relatively flat topography in the study area hid for the hid it has an intense exchange between the shallow groundwater and soil water the water flux between root zone and groundwater u has two components the upward flux the capillarity rise from the groundwater and the downward flux deep water percolation from the root zone to groundwater the groundwater contribution to the evapotranspiration is the main consumption form of groundwater and this can result in salt accumulation in crop root zone the water and salt balance model with daily temporal step is capable of describing the change of soil water storage the exchanges of groundwater and soil water and the exchanges of salt between root zone and groundwater among them water balance in the root zone is calculated as 1e w i 1 j w i j p i i w i j u i j e t a i j 1f w i j z j θ i j where w is the water storage under 1 m depth soil mm z is the depth of the soil here z 1 m p iw and u are precipitation irrigation and water flux between root zone and groundwater mm respectively this study sets the upward flux between root zone and groundwater as the positive direction the soil water produces deep percolation and thus recharges the groundwater when the volumetric water content is greater than the volumetric water content at field capacity otherwise the water flux between root zone and groundwater is the upward flux the capillarity rise from the groundwater due to the fields of the three crops are mutually adjacent it can be assumed that groundwater in the three crops fields have the same groundwater levels by lateral flow so the daily average groundwater depth ghave is used to represent the groundwater depth of each crop the salt balance in the soil and the groundwater is calculated as follows 1g r s i 1 j r s i j i s i j u s i j 1h r s i j w i j s r i j 1i i s i j i w i j

1996 the groundwater level can rise by capillary to root zone when the soil water content is relatively low here we also consider salt transport from groundwater to root zone hu et al 2009 presented

the groundwater depth in the region floats approximately 1 m in april therefore the initial value was set as gh1 1000 mm the process of sunflower irrigation experiments used to calibrate the field water salt simulation model is shown in the section s1 of the supplementary material the model parameters in the simulation model of field water and salt process had been calibrated with the experimental data in table s2 in the section s1 of the supplementary material all comparisons of simulation and observation results showed that the model could simulate the soil water and salt dynamics processes well section s1 of the supplementary material 2 2 2 inexact optimization model reference crop evapotranspiration et0 is the most important parameter for estimating field water consumption climate change can lead to changes and uncertainty in calculating et0 besides market situation and water availability lead to uncertainty in other parameters of the irrigation system these uncertain parameters including et0 economic parameters available irrigation water amount can affect irrigation water allocation for effective irrigation management the objective function of the model is to maximize the irrigation system net benefits irrigation system net benefits can be expressed as gross crop incomes minus water costs crop seed cost planting cost have been included crop income three main crops including maize field 1 ha sunflower field 1 ha and wheat field 1 ha were considered in the study area the 90 confidence interval value was adopted to express the reference crop evapotranspiration crop prices and maximum crop yields are uncertain parameters estimated as fuzzy interval numbers consequently the interactive fuzzy chance constrained programming model is formulated the objective of the developed optimization model can be formulated as follows 2a max f j j r j y m j t 1 t e t t j e t m t j t λ t j s j j i w j t where f is the system net benefit yuan t

the optimization model vladimir and svetlana 2017 for this study the constraint with irrigation water amount less than or equal to available irrigation water amount is satisfied with probability of 1 p 2e pr j j t t i w t j q η 1 p t j where q is the total available irrigation water which is expressed as random variables following normal distributions η is utilization coefficient of canal system p is the violation probability level 3 salt in the soil constraints in order to ensure sustainable ecological development of the region the soil salt content at crop harvest period is controlled in order to reduce the impact of salinity on crops soil salt accumulation constraints are introduced therefore it is assumed that soil salt accumulation should not be greater than 640 mg l during the growth stage for the agriculture sustainable development li 2017 according to many local field experimental data fig s1 the initial soluble salt concentration of the soil water is averagely 1280 mg l so the threshold of the salt concentration of the soil water at harvest is 1920 mg l the effects of soil salinity level on crop growth are presented in xue xue et al 2018 and xue 2018 2f s r e n d j 1920 4 non negativity constraints 2g i w t j 0 t j where srend is the salt concentration of the soil water at the harvest in this study three violation probability p 0 05 0 1 and 0 2 and six feasibility degrees α 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 and 0 9 were chosen the theory of the uncertain programming and the solution process of the simulation optimization framework are shown in the section s2 and s3 of the supplementary material tables 1 3 provide basic parameters associated with the proposed model soil type in the study area is generally sandy loam table 1 presents the maximum crop evapotranspiration etm at different crop growth stages and the sensitivity index in the jensen model the computational process of water sensitivity index is showed in the section s4 of the supplementary material the maximum yield ym comes from inner mongolia autonomous region bureau of statistic the crop price r comes from agricultural product price net in china and the utilization coefficient of canal system η is obtained from water resources planning report of bayannaoer water resource bureau especially ym r η are expressed as fuzzy boundary intervals table 2 the irrigation water availability is determined as the random distributions originated from the historical data table 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 irrigation water allocation by the uncertain simulation optimization framework 3 1 1 optimal irrigation water amount under uncertainty condition fig 3 shows optimal irrigation water amount at different feasibility degrees of constraints and violation probability scenarios for the uncertain simulation optimization framework table 4 shows the system net benefit is expressed by fuzzy boundary interval under different feasibility degrees α and violation probability p for example under the violation probability of 0 05 the maximum system net benefit would be 24037 27555 31247 40292 44927 49280 yuan when feasibility degree is 0 4 and the minimum system net benefit would be 23990 27502 31186 39730 44300 48592 yuan when feasibility degree is 0 9 it is found that the irrigation water allocation of the three crops varies with the change of feasibility degrees and violation probability from the fig 3 and table 4 as feasibility degrees increased irrigation water amount would be decreased or remained unchanged and system net benefit decreased when violation probability increased the system failure risk is greater as well then irrigation water amount would be increased or remained unchanged and system net benefit increased this can attribute to the increase of feasibility degrees which makes decision makers have to choose a more conservative water allocation plan with a decreased system net benefit meanwhile when the violation probability increases the increase of available water will inevitably lead to the increase of system net benefit remarkably under the violation probability of 0 20 the irrigation water amount of maize does not change as feasibility degrees α increased and it has the same irrigation water amount in the upper bound and lower bound the reason is that maize has been fully irrigated with adequate water supply in order to obtain the best solution of multiple feasibility degrees under a given violation probability feasibility degrees and system net benefit need to be weighed so the interactive fuzzy resolution was proposed to address the tradeoffs between feasibility degrees and system net benefit the details and theory are shown in the section s2 and s3 of the supplementary material the results in table 5 show the satisfaction degree of fuzzy goal system net benefit the mean values and deviations of membership grade for the fuzzy it can be seen from the table 5 that the best choice under all violation probability is scheme at the satisfaction degree α 0 9 because its mean value is highest the best choices for the satisfaction degree α 0 9 schemes are thus a mean value of 0 432 and a deviation of 0 009 a mean value of 0 437 and a deviation of 0 005 a mean value of 0 446 and a deviation of 0 005 under p 0 05 0 10 0 20 respectively the results indicate that the developed model has the ability to obtain the suitable system net benefit according to decision makers needs and the decision makers should be highly concerned with the balanced relationship between feasibility degrees and system net benefit 3 1 2 monthly irrigation water allocation schemes of different crops taking the best solutions which were mentioned above as an example the monthly irrigation water allocation is shown in fig 4 the results are expressed as interval values to reflect uncertainty rather than deterministic numbers the decision makers would select the upper bound of allocation water to deal with climate warming which causes high evaporation it can be seen that the irrigation water allocation of the three crops follows maize wheat sunflower more specifically under p 0 05 the total irrigation water amount is 424 429 mm for maize 309 316 mm for wheat 202 249 mm for sunflower under p 0 10 the result is 441 445 mm for maize 324 350 mm for wheat 218 249 mm for sunflower while under p 0 20 the result is 445 mm for maize 324 353 mm for wheat 275 312 mm for sunflower this is consistent with the local typical irrigation system with maize 340 mm wheat 330 mm sunflower 310 mm bameng 2011 the actual irrigated amount of the three crops is different of which maize is the largest this is because that the longer growth time of maize result in more water consumption and water demand as the violation probability increases the available irrigation water amount would be increased but change of irrigation water amount for maize is not significant this indicated that the irrigation water amount is able to meet the best growth of maize and it will not increase with the increase of the available water furthermore the model gives priority to satisfy water requirement for wheat growth the reasons are that the water consumption of wheat is greater than that of sunflower and the economic benefit of wheat is higher than that of sunflower monthly irrigation water allocation of maize in june is increased with an increased violation probability p under insufficient irrigation water conditions the result of the model meets the water requirement by turns in july august and may followed june this is mainly because the model is more sensitive to salt constraint and water stress so the model gives priority to meet water requirement in july with water sensitivity index most and in august relieving the soil salinization soil moisture and soil salinity threshold need to be considered in early growth stage to meet crops growing subsequently irrigation and rainfall can decrease accumulation of salt in soil and satisfy the water need of crop growth certainly similar trends can be obtained for sunflower and wheat irrigation water at the end of growth stage can reduce the salt content in the soil as the salt content threshold constraint in the optimization model therefore the irrigation date should be also chosen at the final of growth stage for relieving the soil salinization for a certain total irrigation water amount the monthly irrigation water allocation of maize showed that there was an increasing trend in the amount of irrigation required from beginning of the season may to the end of the season august it is similar increasing trend with that of wheat from april to june while for sunflower the highest monthly irrigation demand was observed in june and the lowest was in july this is because sunflower has shorter growing period with lower salt content at harvest and more water sensitivity index in june 3 2 effect of groundwater table depth on the irrigation water allocation fig 5 shows the irrigation water amount of different crops and system net benefit at different gtd 1 1 5 2 2 5 3 m and no groundwater exchange consideration under feasibility degrees α 0 9 and violation probability p 0 05 the irrigation water amount for wheat has an increasing trend with decline of groundwater levels it indicates that the irrigation decision for wheat is highly dependent on gtd the reason is mainly that wheat plants early the decrease of upward flux caused by the increase of gtd thus has effect on the growth of wheat than of maize and sunflower the irrigation water amount for maize and sunflower change little with different gtd this is because maize and sunflower grow close to each other and compete with water amount the gtd benefit curve forms a fitting function with a maximum value in fig 5 in general gtd of 1 5 m will bring greatest benefit and system net benefit of the framework is larger than that of the framework without groundwater exchange consideration with gtd of 1 5 m system net benefits averagely is 27469 44818 yuan from the framework 25796 41205 yuan from the framework without groundwater exchange consideration this means groundwater can significantly contribute to crop evapotranspiration and enhance system net benefit it agrees with findings of huo et al 2012 that irrigation water productivity increased with the much shallower groundwater tables however large accumulation of soil salinity caused by high groundwater level will restrain crop growth and decrease system net benefit overall water exchange process among soil irrigation and groundwater is the key link of irrigation decision making optimization which will directly influence the economic benefit thus the developed framework can provide more comprehensive water transformation process and improve the accuracy of the results than the framework without groundwater exchange consideration 3 3 effect of soil salt constraint at end of crop growth on the irrigation water allocation to investigate impact of soil salinity constraint at end of crop growth on irrigation decision we compared the optimization results of irrigation decision from the framework with and without soil salinity threshold the optimization results of the irrigation water amount with and without soil salinity constraint under gtd of 1 0 m and 1 5 m are shown in fig 6 under shallower gtd condition optimized irrigation water amount is smaller for maize while much for sunflower and wheat by the framework without soil salinity threshold however under deep groundwater condition optimized irrigation water amount is larger for sunflower while smaller for maize and wheat by the framework without soil salinity threshold as a result irrigation system net benefit is lower with soil salinity constraint than without soil salinity constraint the irrigation system net benefit was 4 11 higher without soil salinity constraint the reason is that although salt accumulation affects crop growth decreasing irrigation system net benefit without considering salt constraint crops can be irrigated with crop water consumption increasing benefit the irrigation decision without soil salinity constraint would be aggravate soil salinization and make decision makers overestimate economic development furthermore the results of developed framework for benefit have narrowed decision space and it can provide more effective decision fig 7 shows that the monthly irrigation water allocation for different crops at 1 m groundwater table depth the total irrigation water amount for maize decrease and that of sunflower and wheat increase without considering salt constraint the irrigation water amount for maize changed greatly in august the irrigation is 61 mm without considering salt constraint which is nearly 60 less than that of under salt constraint condition the salt tolerance of maize is low and in order to meet the soil salt constraint a large water amount was irrigated for maize in august to achieve the effect of leaching it is the same effect as autumn flood irrigation system developed to reduce the salinity of the root zone and increase the water use efficiency feng et al 2005 the irrigation amount for sunflower in july changed greatly the irrigation water amount is 58 mm without considering salt constraint which is about 3 times higher than that of under salt constraint condition 15 mm the irrigation water amount for wheat in may changed significantly the irrigation water amount is 152 mm in the absence of salt constraint which is about 1 5 times higher than that of under salt constraint condition 63 mm the results without salt constraint are mainly controlled by water stress the water consumption of sunflower and wheat in july and may are strong so irrigation is increased with the growth of crops soil salinization is serious in order to meet the constraint of soil salt the irrigation at the end growth stage by framework is larger thus the results without salt constraint will aggravate the soil salinization and affect the sustainable development of the ecological environment in summary the developed framework controls the salinity of soil by taking into account the soil salt accumulation the water allocation plans from the framework are also more conservative which effectively alleviates the aggravation of soil salinization 4 conclusions in this study we develop a simulation optimization framework under uncertainty for optimizing irrigation schemes aiming at irrigation agricultural sustainable development by simulating field water and salt transport and crop yield response to water and salt content of root zone the framework takes the shallow groundwater contribution to the soil water and salt content into account moreover the framework can handle uncertain parameters expressed as not only fuzzy boundary intervals but also probability distributions and tradeoffs among the satisfaction of system net benefit and the feasibility degree of constraints the main advantage of the developed simulation optimization framework is its ability to incorporate agro hydrological processes into an inexact optimization model and it can improve the irrigation sustainability by considering water exchange of soil water and groundwater and soil salt accumulation decision makers can obtain the best solution of multiple feasibility degrees under a given violation probability from the framework also scenario analysis shows that how irrigation water allocation to be affected with soil salinity threshold and groundwater table depth these results demonstrate that this new framework is an effective tool to obtain more accurate irrigation water allocation planning and slow down soil salinization it is useful for sustainable irrigation water management in arid areas with shallow saline groundwater the reliability of the framework should be further calibrated and validated with more measurements in further studies also other sources of uncertainties rainfall soil characteristics etc to be included in the irrigation decision framework and the soil physio chemical characteristics clay contents organic matter lime contents cation exchange capacity are also contributory factors in soil water relations these should be considered in future work declaration of competing interest the authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest acknowledgments this research was supported by the national key research and

10713,field irrigation water management depends on interactions among crop yield soil water salt and groundwater salt in arid irrigation area with shallow saline groundwater this paper presents a novel uncertainty simulation optimization framework for irrigation water allocation and sustainable agricultural environment which integrates simulation of physical processes of soil groundwater water and salt balance into an uncertainty based optimization model the impacts of crop evapotranspiration soil water and salt and groundwater levels are interactively involved in the simulation model uncertainties economic and crop parameters available water amount presented as fuzzy boundary intervals and probability distribution functions are considered in the optimization model this field irrigation water allocation framework emphasizes the role of field soil water and salt movement processes to decision making of irrigation water allocation then the proposed simulation optimization framework was applied to a case study in the hetao irrigation district an arid area of northwest china where soil salinity is a serious environmental problem induced by irrigation and shallow groundwater therefore optimal irrigation water allocation solutions can be generated for providing decision makers with reliable decision options where the maximum system benefits resulting from sustainable agricultural production are desired furthermore the results can support analysis of interrelationships among system benefits water allocation planning and groundwater depth soil salt content constraints scenario analysis groundwater table depth gtd 1 1 5 2 2 5 3 m and no groundwater exchange consideration showed that the maximum net benefit could be 27469 44818 yuan with the groundwater table depth of 1 5 m also the irrigation water allocation changed when the salt constraint was considered which indicates that the results obtained by the developed framework can alleviate soil salinization to a certain degree therefore this framework can provide more effective information for the irrigation water management and soil salinization control which is meaningful for the sustainable development of irrigation agriculture keywords irrigation optimization field water and salt processes shallow groundwater salinity uncertainty 1 introduction in arid and semi arid lands agricultural crop production faces two significant problems namely water resources shortage and soil salinity sepaskhah and falakdehia 2009 specifically more than 30 of the irrigated lands in arid and semi arid areas are affected by soil salinity li et al 2014 asfaw et al 2018 which is a serious threat to crop production the sustainable planning and management of irrigation water resources plays a critical role in food security and sustainable agro ecosystems tilman et al 2002 kang et al 2017 furthermore improving irrigation schedule is important to ensure crops to satisfy their irrigation water demand with limited irrigation water resources kourgialas et al 2019 therefore it is significant to optimize irrigation water allocation especially in arid areas with serious water shortages and soil salinity problems in the past decades some studies have been carried out on the optimization of irrigation water resources including traditional optimization methods and inexact or uncertain optimization models kumar et al 2006 soundharajan and sudheer 2009 karamouz et al 2010 prasad et al 2011 mirajkar and patel 2016 zhang and guo 2018 however most studies merely consider simple agro hydrological process in fact both soil water flow and salt physical movement processes are important factors to determine irrigation water allocation because such a dynamic water and salt condition within the root zone influences the total available soil water in the root zone recently some studies have generally focused on irrigation water management integrating the optimization and water cycle process simulation model yu and shang 2016 and wen et al 2017 used a simulation optimization model by integrating water balance model crop water production function and optimization model for analyzing optimal irrigation schedule these models used the field water balance model to simulate the change of soil water content but contribution of shallow groundwater to crop water requirement had not been considered moreover in some arid irrigation areas with shallow groundwater level there is a strong and frequent water exchange between soil water and groundwater ayars and schoneman 2006 xue et al 2018 thus the effects of groundwater on crop yields cannot be ignored farahani et al 2009 awan 2010 for example alizadeh and mousavi 2013 tried to optimize irrigation water allocation in a shallow groundwater region by a random soil water and salt dynamics this method could not capture the physic processes of water exchange between soil water and groundwater akhtar et al 2013 used aquacrop model and hydrus 1d model to optimize deficit irrigation scheduling under shallow groundwater conditions but it wasn t aware of soil salinity problem moreover soil salinity will increase at the end of crop growth period because of high evapotranspiration to guarantee sustainable development of irrigation agriculture controlling the soil salinity at the end of crop growth period should be considered when determining irrigation planning furthermore it is noted that irrigation water allocation is more complicated due to some uncertain factors such as climate condition water demand market situation brink et al 2008 regulwar and gurav 2011 chen et al 2019 some inexact optimization methods have been used for irrigation water allocation yoshihide et al 2013 liu et al 2017b li et al 2018 among the most used uncertain methods chance constrained programming ccp can deal with stochastic uncertainty i e uncertain parameters expressed as probabilistic distribution functions in the irrigation water management system and tackle the risk of violating constraints charnes and cooper 1959 maqsood and huang 2003 gu et al 2012 zhang et al 2019 interval mathematical programming imp can effectively deal with uncertain parameters expressed as intervals with lower and upper bounds but with unknown distribution information huang et al 1992 therefore it is more thorough for irrigation water allocation to introduce inexact approach thus reflecting the real world complexity of irrigation management however only few of the research paid attention to simulation based uncertain optimization model for irrigation water allocation aiming to sustainable irrigation water management in arid area with shallow saline groundwater the objective of this study is to 1 propose a simulation optimization framework under uncertainty for optimal irrigation water allocation which integrates an agro hydrological simulation model and an uncertain optimization model 2 explore the impact of shallow groundwater conditions and soil salt content constraint on the optimization results of irrigation water allocation 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the hetao irrigation district hid one of the three largest irrigation districts in china is located in inner mongolia northwestern china 40 19 41 18 n 106 20 109 19 e altitude 1039 m fig 1 the district covers an area of 11 200 km2 and has irrigation area of 5700 km2 maize sunflower and wheat are the main crops accounting for 85 of the total cultivated land in the study area gao et al 2018 traditional irrigation methods are mostly adopted and crop planting pattern is fragmentary it s a typical arid and semi arid area with an average annual precipitation from 130 mm to 220 mm and evaporation from 2000 mm to 2500 mm 20 cm pan jia et al 2017 irrigation is therefore a necessary measure for crop growth and agricultural production the groundwater level is shallow varying from 1 m to 3 m the soil is thus suffering from widespread salinity problem in the region liu et al 2017a chemical composition of groundwater salinity is mainly composed of nacl kcl and caso4 xue et al 2018 most of the irrigation water comes from the yellow river with salinity of 0 5 g l because the yellow river carries a lot of sediment and minerals wu et al 2008 thus a large amount of salt is delivered to the hid because the annual diverted water volume is about 5 billion m3 therefore soil salinization is a severe problem which is the main reason for restricting agricultural production in the irrigated area 2 2 uncertain simulation optimization framework for irrigation water allocation field water flow and salt movement processes simulation model and inexact irrigation water optimization allocation model are coupled to obtain the irrigation water allocation solutions under different crop growth stages of three typical crops maize sunflower and wheat fig 2 maize is planted in april and harvested in september sunflower is planted in may and harvested in september and wheat is planted in march and harvested in july field scale water and salt balance model is used to describe the physical processes of soil water and salt dynamics affected by irrigation and shallow groundwater level crop actual evapotranspiration is estimated based on a daily soil water and salinity content furthermore crop yield can be calculated by the jensen model jensen 1968 which is a crop yield water consumption relationship the optimal irrigation amount decision variable at growth stages for crops can be achieved by the inexact optimization model with the objective of maximizing irrigation system net benefit meanwhile outputs irrigation amount of the optimization model have feedbacks to the water and salt balance module of simulation model soil salt threshold at crop harvest is a constraint in the optimization model the simulation model is used to simulate the crop yield soil salt and groundwater depth for the optimization model after that crop water flow and salt movement model were coupled into the irrigation decision making model 2 2 1 simulation model considering field water flow and salt movement process actual crop evapotranspiration is affected by root zone water and salinity stress generally crop actual evapotranspiration eta is considered to decrease when the electrical conductivity of the soil saturation extract ece is higher than the threshold ecet crop evapotranspiration under water and salt stress is calculated by following formulas allen et al 1998 and domíngueza et al 2011 1a e t

electrical conductivity of the soil saturation extract above which the crop yield is affected by salinity ds m 1 b is a crop specific parameter which describes the rate of yield decrease per unit of excess salts ds 1 m and ky is the crop yield response factor the water and salt balance model considers the main components i e irrigation iw precipitation p the water flux between root zone and groundwater u and actual evapotranspiration eta in this study surface runoff was ignored because of low rainfall and relatively flat topography in the study area hid for the hid it has an intense exchange between the shallow groundwater and soil water the water flux between root zone and groundwater u has two components the upward flux the capillarity rise from the groundwater and the downward flux deep water percolation from the root zone to groundwater the groundwater contribution to the evapotranspiration is the main consumption form of groundwater and this can result in salt accumulation in crop root zone the water and salt balance model with daily temporal step is capable of describing the change of soil water storage the exchanges of groundwater and soil water and the exchanges of salt between root zone and groundwater among them water balance in the root zone is calculated as 1e w i 1 j w i j p i i w i j u i j e t a i j 1f w i j z j θ i j where w is the water storage under 1 m depth soil mm z is the depth of the soil here z 1 m p iw and u are precipitation irrigation and water flux between root zone and groundwater mm respectively this study sets the upward flux between root zone and groundwater as the positive direction the soil water produces deep percolation and thus recharges the groundwater when the volumetric water content is greater than the volumetric water content at field capacity otherwise the water flux between root zone and groundwater is the upward flux the capillarity rise from the groundwater due to the fields of the three crops are mutually adjacent it can be assumed that groundwater in the three crops fields have the same groundwater levels by lateral flow so the daily average groundwater depth ghave is used to represent the groundwater depth of each crop the salt balance in the soil and the groundwater is calculated as follows 1g r s i 1 j r s i j i s i j u s i j 1h r s i j w i j s r i j 1i i s i j i w i j

1996 the groundwater level can rise by capillary to root zone when the soil water content is relatively low here we also consider salt transport from groundwater to root zone hu et al 2009 presented

the groundwater depth in the region floats approximately 1 m in april therefore the initial value was set as gh1 1000 mm the process of sunflower irrigation experiments used to calibrate the field water salt simulation model is shown in the section s1 of the supplementary material the model parameters in the simulation model of field water and salt process had been calibrated with the experimental data in table s2 in the section s1 of the supplementary material all comparisons of simulation and observation results showed that the model could simulate the soil water and salt dynamics processes well section s1 of the supplementary material 2 2 2 inexact optimization model reference crop evapotranspiration et0 is the most important parameter for estimating field water consumption climate change can lead to changes and uncertainty in calculating et0 besides market situation and water availability lead to uncertainty in other parameters of the irrigation system these uncertain parameters including et0 economic parameters available irrigation water amount can affect irrigation water allocation for effective irrigation management the objective function of the model is to maximize the irrigation system net benefits irrigation system net benefits can be expressed as gross crop incomes minus water costs crop seed cost planting cost have been included crop income three main crops including maize field 1 ha sunflower field 1 ha and wheat field 1 ha were considered in the study area the 90 confidence interval value was adopted to express the reference crop evapotranspiration crop prices and maximum crop yields are uncertain parameters estimated as fuzzy interval numbers consequently the interactive fuzzy chance constrained programming model is formulated the objective of the developed optimization model can be formulated as follows 2a max f j j r j y m j t 1 t e t t j e t m t j t λ t j s j j i w j t where f is the system net benefit yuan t

is the violation probability level 3 salt in the soil constraints in order to ensure sustainable ecological development of the region the soil salt content at crop harvest period is controlled in order to reduce the impact of salinity on crops soil salt accumulation constraints are introduced therefore it is assumed that soil salt accumulation should not be greater than 640 mg l during the growth stage for the agriculture sustainable development li 2017 according to many local field experimental data fig s1 the initial soluble salt concentration of the soil water is averagely 1280 mg l so the threshold of the salt concentration of the soil water at harvest is 1920 mg l the effects of soil salinity level on crop growth are presented in xue xue et al 2018 and xue 2018 2f s r e n d j

violation probability p for example under the violation probability of 0 05 the maximum system net benefit would be 24037 27555 31247 40292 44927 49280 yuan when feasibility degree is 0 4 and the minimum system net benefit would be 23990 27502 31186 39730 44300 48592 yuan when feasibility degree is 0 9 it is found that the irrigation water allocation of the three crops varies with the change of feasibility degrees and violation probability from the fig 3 and table 4 as feasibility degrees increased irrigation water amount would be decreased or remained unchanged and system net benefit decreased when violation probability increased the system failure risk is greater as well then irrigation water amount would be increased or remained unchanged and system net benefit increased this can attribute to the increase of feasibility degrees which makes decision makers have to choose a more conservative water allocation plan with a decreased system net benefit meanwhile when the violation probability increases the increase of available water will inevitably lead to the increase of system net benefit remarkably under the violation probability of 0 20 the irrigation water amount of maize does not change as feasibility degrees α increased and it has the same irrigation water amount in the upper bound and lower bound the reason is that maize has been fully irrigated with adequate water supply in order to obtain the best solution of multiple feasibility degrees under a given violation probability feasibility degrees and system net benefit need to be weighed so the interactive fuzzy resolution was proposed to address the tradeoffs between feasibility degrees and system net benefit the details and theory are shown in the section s2 and s3 of the supplementary material the results in table 5 show the satisfaction degree of fuzzy goal system net benefit the mean values and deviations of membership grade for the fuzzy it can be seen from the table 5 that the best choice under all violation probability is scheme at the satisfaction degree α 0 9 because its mean value is highest the best choices for the satisfaction degree α 0 9 schemes are thus a mean value of 0 432 and a deviation of 0 009 a mean value of 0 437 and a deviation of 0 005 a mean value of 0 446 and a deviation of 0 005 under p 0 05 0 10 0 20 respectively the results indicate that the developed model has the ability to obtain the suitable system net benefit according to decision makers needs and the decision makers should be highly concerned with the balanced relationship between feasibility degrees and system net benefit 3 1 2 monthly irrigation water allocation schemes of different crops taking the best solutions which were mentioned above as an example the monthly irrigation water allocation is shown in fig 4 the results are expressed as interval values to reflect uncertainty rather than deterministic numbers the decision makers would select the upper bound of allocation water to deal with climate warming which causes high evaporation it can be seen that the irrigation water allocation of the three crops follows maize wheat sunflower more specifically under p 0 05 the total irrigation water amount is 424 429 mm for maize 309 316 mm for wheat 202 249 mm for sunflower under p 0 10 the result is 441 445 mm for maize 324 350 mm for wheat 218 249 mm for sunflower while under p 0 20 the result is 445 mm for maize 324 353 mm for wheat 275 312 mm for sunflower this is consistent with the local typical irrigation system with maize 340 mm wheat 330 mm sunflower 310 mm bameng 2011 the actual irrigated amount of the three crops is different of which maize is the largest this is because that the longer growth time of maize result in more water consumption and water demand as the violation probability increases the available irrigation water amount would be increased but change of irrigation water amount for maize is not significant this indicated that the irrigation water amount is able to meet the best growth of maize and it will not increase with the increase of the available water furthermore the model gives priority to satisfy water requirement for wheat growth the reasons are that the water consumption of wheat is greater than that of sunflower and the economic benefit of wheat is higher than that of sunflower monthly irrigation water allocation of maize in june is increased with an increased violation probability p under insufficient irrigation water conditions the result of the model meets the water requirement by turns in july august and may followed june this is mainly because the model is more sensitive to salt constraint and water stress so the model gives priority to meet water requirement in july with water sensitivity index most and in august relieving the soil salinization soil moisture and soil salinity threshold need to be considered in early growth stage to meet crops growing subsequently irrigation and rainfall can decrease accumulation of salt in soil and satisfy the water need of crop growth certainly similar trends can be obtained for sunflower and wheat irrigation water at the end of growth stage can reduce the salt content in the soil as the salt content threshold constraint in the optimization model therefore the irrigation date should be also chosen at the final of growth stage for relieving the soil salinization for a certain total irrigation water amount the monthly irrigation water allocation of maize showed that there was an increasing trend in the amount of irrigation required from beginning of the season may to the end of the season august it is similar increasing trend with that of wheat from april to june while for sunflower the highest monthly irrigation demand was observed in june and the lowest was in july this is because sunflower has shorter growing period with lower salt content at harvest and more water sensitivity index in june 3 2 effect of groundwater table depth on the irrigation water allocation fig 5 shows the irrigation water amount of different crops and system net benefit at different gtd 1 1 5 2 2 5 3 m and no groundwater exchange consideration under feasibility degrees α 0 9 and violation probability p 0 05 the irrigation water amount for wheat has an increasing trend with decline of groundwater levels it indicates that the irrigation decision for wheat is highly dependent on gtd the reason is mainly that wheat plants early the decrease of upward flux caused by the increase of gtd thus has effect on the growth of wheat than of maize and sunflower the irrigation water amount for maize and sunflower change little with different gtd this is because maize and sunflower grow close to each other and compete with water amount the gtd benefit curve forms a fitting function with a maximum value in fig 5 in general gtd of 1 5 m will bring greatest benefit and system net benefit of the framework is larger than that of the framework without groundwater exchange consideration with gtd of 1 5 m system net benefits averagely is 27469 44818 yuan from the framework 25796 41205 yuan from the framework without groundwater exchange consideration this means groundwater can significantly contribute to crop evapotranspiration and enhance system net benefit it agrees with findings of huo et al 2012 that irrigation water productivity increased with the much shallower groundwater tables however large accumulation of soil salinity caused by high groundwater level will restrain crop growth and decrease system net benefit overall water exchange process among soil irrigation and groundwater is the key link of irrigation decision making optimization which will directly influence the economic benefit thus the developed framework can provide more comprehensive water transformation process and improve the accuracy of the results than the framework without groundwater exchange consideration 3 3 effect of soil salt constraint at end of crop growth on the irrigation water allocation to investigate impact of soil salinity constraint at end of crop growth on irrigation decision we compared the optimization results of irrigation decision from the framework with and without soil salinity threshold the optimization results of the irrigation water amount with and without soil salinity constraint under gtd of 1 0 m and 1 5 m are shown in fig 6 under shallower gtd condition optimized irrigation water amount is smaller for maize while much for sunflower and wheat by the framework without soil salinity threshold however under deep groundwater condition optimized irrigation water amount is larger for sunflower while smaller for maize and wheat by the framework without soil salinity threshold as a result irrigation system net benefit is lower with soil salinity constraint than without soil salinity constraint the irrigation system net benefit was 4 11 higher without soil salinity constraint the reason is that although salt accumulation affects crop growth decreasing irrigation system net benefit without considering salt constraint crops can be irrigated with crop water consumption increasing benefit the irrigation decision without soil salinity constraint would be aggravate soil salinization and make decision makers overestimate economic development furthermore the results of developed framework for benefit have narrowed decision space and it can provide more effective decision fig 7 shows that the monthly irrigation water allocation for different crops at 1 m groundwater table depth the total irrigation water amount for maize decrease and that of sunflower and wheat increase without considering salt constraint the irrigation water amount for maize changed greatly in august the irrigation is 61 mm without considering salt constraint which is nearly 60 less than that of under salt constraint condition the salt tolerance of maize is low and in order to meet the soil salt constraint a large water amount was irrigated for maize in august to achieve the effect of leaching it is the same effect as autumn flood irrigation system developed to reduce the salinity of the root zone and increase the water use efficiency feng et al 2005 the irrigation amount for sunflower in july changed greatly the irrigation water amount is 58 mm without considering salt constraint which is about 3 times higher than that of under salt constraint condition 15 mm the irrigation water amount for wheat in may changed significantly the irrigation water amount is 152 mm in the absence of salt constraint which is about 1 5 times higher than that of under salt constraint condition 63 mm the results without salt constraint are mainly controlled by water stress the water consumption of sunflower and wheat in july and may are strong so irrigation is increased with the growth of crops soil salinization is serious in order to meet the constraint of soil salt the irrigation at the end growth stage by framework is larger thus the results without salt constraint will aggravate the soil salinization and affect the sustainable development of the ecological environment in summary the developed framework controls the salinity of soil by taking into account the soil salt accumulation the water allocation plans from the framework are also more conservative which effectively alleviates the aggravation of soil salinization 4 conclusions in this study we develop a simulation optimization framework under uncertainty for optimizing irrigation schemes aiming at irrigation agricultural sustainable development by simulating field water and salt transport and crop yield response to water and salt content of root zone the framework takes the shallow groundwater contribution to the soil water and salt content into account moreover the framework can handle uncertain parameters expressed as not only fuzzy boundary intervals but also probability distributions and tradeoffs among the satisfaction of system net benefit and the feasibility degree of constraints the main advantage of the developed simulation optimization framework is its ability to incorporate agro hydrological processes into an inexact optimization model and it can improve the irrigation sustainability by considering water exchange of soil water and groundwater and soil salt accumulation decision makers can obtain the best solution of multiple feasibility degrees under a given violation probability from the framework also scenario analysis shows that how irrigation water allocation to be affected with soil salinity threshold and groundwater table depth these results demonstrate that this new framework is an effective tool to obtain more accurate irrigation water allocation planning and slow down soil salinization it is useful for sustainable irrigation water management in arid areas with shallow saline groundwater the reliability of the framework should be further calibrated and validated with more measurements in further studies also other sources of uncertainties rainfall soil characteristics etc to be included in the irrigation decision framework and the soil physio chemical characteristics clay contents organic matter lime contents cation exchange capacity are also contributory factors in soil water relations these should

10714,in the last years several satellite based models using measured or forecast meteorological data have been developed for determining spatially distributed crop evapotranspiration etc estimates the study herein presented aims at assessing the reliability of the arcdualkc model based on the fao 56 dual crop coefficient kc for deriving spatially distributed estimates of kc and etc in a deficit irrigated di orange orchard daily etc and dual kc values were obtained using sentinel 2 satellite imagery in combination with measured and forecast meteorological data provided by the nearest weather station and by cosmo model respectively overestimations on kc and etc resulted from the study when using forecast instead of measured meteorological data average pbias of 7 62 and 26 24 respectively this might be caused by some inaccuracies in meteorological predictions the evaporation coefficient ke derived by the arcdualkc model resulted similar between the di and the fully irrigated treatments differences up to 6 in terms of kc and etc were identified among the irrigation strategies mainly due to variations of the transpiration coefficient kcb despite the reliability of the arcdualkc model the obtained results might be influenced by the heterogeneity of sentinel 2 pixel containing vegetated and bare soil surfaces highlighting the need to integrate the model with ground based data or by using higher resolution images keywords remote sensing data modelling sentinel 2 crop coefficients precision irrigation 1 introduction irrigation contributes to the greatest amount of water consumption among several economic sectors dubois 2011 especially in semi arid areas where water deficit is a limiting factor for crop production singh et al 2017 a well scheduled and dosed irrigation regime is essential for matching crop water requirements gu et al 2017 and vice versa accurate estimations of crop evapotranspiration etc represent a significant proxy for scheduling irrigation gong et al 2019 several satellite based models have been developed in the last 30 years for determining spatially distributed etc estimates at different spatial scales zhang et al 2016 mokhtari et al 2018 olivera guerra et al 2018 ramírez cuesta et al 2019a in general these models are divided in two categories those based on the surface energy balance seb and those based on vegetation indexes vi the first category computes the latent heat flux and thus etc using ground based ancillary data and remotely sensed data in the visible vis near infrared nir and thermal tir portions of the electromagnetic spectrum zhang et al 2016 however the current limited spatial resolution in thermal domain restricts the use of these models at field scale especially when the plot size is smaller than the pixel resolution ramírez cuesta et al 2019a the second category of models computes etc from empirical site specific relationships between the fraction of ground covered by vegetation and vi derived from the canopy reflectance in vis and nir these models are usually based on the fao 56 approach allen et al 1998 which estimates etc by multiplying reference evapotranspiration et0 by a single or dual crop coefficient kc in the dual kc approach kc accounts for both plant transpiration t and soil evaporation e terms represented by a basal crop coefficient kcb and a soil evaporation coefficient ke respectively allen et al 1998 the dual kc approach is often applied for its simplicity and operational basis consoli et al 2016 olivera guerra et al 2018 in fact it requires few inputs including phenological stages irrigation amounts and standard meteorological data even if a site specific soil water balance is needed vanella et al 2019 however weather data when available are affected by large uncertainties since they are estimated by spatial interpolation of sparse meteorological ground stations lorite et al 2015 nowadays in order to overcome the limitation of available

facing with extreme events chirico et al 2018 in this study spatially distributed estimates of kc and etc were retrieved at farm level by a geographic information system gis procedure integrated into the arcdualkc model ramírez cuesta et al 2019b which incorporated remote sensing rs and separately measured and forecast meteorological data within the fao 56 dual kc approach the main objectives of the study were i to assess the reliability of the arcdualkc model combined with forecast meteorological data provided by cosmo model for obtaining a priori spatially distributed kc and etc and ii to evaluate the arcdualkc model performance to predict et fluxes and kc values of deficit irrigated plots in semi arid mediterranean conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study was

slight differences may be observed between data obtained using measured or forecast meteorological data table 3 at full irrigation t1 kcb arcdualkc varied between 0 60 to 0 63 0 11 in all the di treatment t2 t4 and had a value of 0 64 in t1 full irrigation ke arcdualkc values were quite constant for all the irrigation treatments with values of 0 06 0 07 0 96 the underestimations observed in kcb at the di treatments resulted in lower kc arcdualkc and etc rates compared to the full irrigation up to 5 and 6 respectively with average kc arcdualkc of 0 67 0 69 0 14 0 15 versus 0 70 0 14 respectively etc values were in the range 4 56 4 74 0 34 0 35 mm d 1 in the di treatment versus 4 83 0 34 mm d 1 in t1 the obtained results were quite similar using measured meteorological data as input for computing the kcb arcdualkc with values of 0 59 0 08 in t1 and varying from 0 56 to 0 58 0 08 0 11 in the di treatments t2 t4 no differences between t1 and t2 t4 were observed in terms of ke arcdualkc with aa mean of 0 06 0 87 0 93 kc arcdualkc and etc values t2 t4 decreased up to 6 in the di treatments if compared to t1 with average kc arcdualkc of 0 62 0 64 0 11 0 14 in t2 t4 versus 0 65 0 11 in t1 and average etc of 3 6 3 7 mm d 1 0 33 in t2 t4 versus 3 8 mm d 1 0 32 in t1 4 discussion the kcb arcdualkc values obtained in the study were lower than those tabulated by the fao 56 paper and adjusted during the development and final phenological stages for local meteorological conditions the observed discrepancies were mainly caused by the model calibration procedure which selects within the full irrigation treatment t1 pixels that better represent potential irrigation conditions i e maximum savi and fc on the contrary kcb arcdualkc values on mid plant stage resulted higher than kcb tab mainly due to the specificity of the local climate condition consoli et al 2006a characterised by semi arid mediterranean climate conditions that most probably does not match the sub humid climate conditions with rhmin of about 45 and with calm to moderate u2 of 2 m s 1 at the base of kcb adj calculation in fact more arid climate conditions with greater wind speed would result in higher values of kcb adj allen et al 1998 several authors have reported higher values for kcb adj respect to kcb tab highlighting the crucial role of the specific climatic adjustment of kcb tab values benli et al 2006 paço et al 2006 however kcb arcdualkc values resulted lower than kcb adj during the middle season as consequence of the model calibration procedure effect identified also in the other phenological stages thus kcb is influenced by the vegetation reflectance condition occurred at the field site within the first arcdualkc sub model it was computed as a function of fc and savi resulting in smaller values respect to the kcb adj values in the present study the arcdualkc model was able to distinguish the different irrigation treatments supplied at the study site in terms of kcb arcdualkc as indicator of transpiration due to the imposed water deficit conditions comstock 2002 thus results showed kcb arcdualkc values up to 6 higher in full irrigation t1 respect to di treatments t2 t4 on the contrary no differences were observed in ke arcdualkc terms since the evaporation process occurs on a limited extension referred to the surface wetted by the drippers that in the arcdualkc model is assumed to be constant independently of the irrigation treatment the above mentioned discrepancies among treatments mainly in terms of kcb arcdualkc led to differences of 5 in kc arcdualkc and 6 in etc estimates between the full irrigation t1 and the di treatments t2 t4 these results confirm that as suggested by other authors rallo et al 2014 2017 agro hydrological models can be considered as an easy to use tool for indirect evaluations of soil and crop water status the use of forecast meteorological data for a priori etc estimations could be useful for providing irrigation advices to farmers in operative scenarios since it allows to plan irrigation water supply based on expected realistic meteorological conditions rather than on past and or current meteorological data chirico et al 2018 in this study kcb arcdualkc values computed using forecast meteorological data rh and u2 as input resulted 8 higher than those obtained using measured weather data this can be due to the uncertainties in the agro meteorological forecasted parameters which are used in the arcdualkc model tair rh rs u2 p the application of cosmo model has produced overestimation of tair 8 u2 31 and p up to 100 whereas it has underestimated rh and rs 26 and 11 respectively several authors reported the same behaviour in their studies luo et al 2014 xiong et al 2016 yang et al 2016 however even if large inaccuracies were observed in some agrometeorological variables the estimates of kcb arcdualkc using forecast data did not differ too much 8 from those values obtained by using the measured data as a consequence of the compensation of the expected error i e the underestimation of rh of 26 was offset by an overestimation of u2 up 31 furthermore the inaccuracies in the predicted agrometeorological variables also influenced the et0 estimates calculated with the penman monteith equation resulting in an overestimation of up to 17 despite this overestimation using weather forecasted data still has the advantage that farmers can anticipate their irrigation scheduling to near future weather conditions in terms of lead time a different behaviour was observed for the values of ke arcdualkc which showed an increase in the trend from 1 day to 3 days table 3 mainly due to an increase in the occurrence of the precipitations predicted by cosmo model from 1 to 3 days the onset of precipitation increased by about 50 figs 4 5 consequently the lead time had a slight effect on kc arcdualkc and etc with discrepancies less than 2 between lead times of 1 day and 3 days table 3 this decreasing trend in the accuracy of the single agrometeorological prediction variable has also benn observed in other studies lorite et al 2015 pelosi et al 2016 xiong et al 2016 cao et al 2019 who found differences up to 25 in u2 lorite et al 2015 when the forecast horizon increased from 1 to 3 days despite the reliability of arcdualkc in modelling etc at field level the results could be influenced by the pixel size of sentinel 2 which contains both vegetated and bare soil surfaces in this sense the arcdualkc model could be improved by integrating the data obtained from ground measurements e g electrical resistivity tomography ert lisimetry sap flow and eddy covariance motisi et al 2012 consoli and papa 2013 to obtain more accurate soil parameters campos et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 vanella et al 2019 or more reliable crop coefficient values instead of using those tabulated on fao 56 paper consoli et al 2006b peddinti and kambhammettu 2019 this information would help to better understand the specificity of the site increasing the accuracy of the etc estimates other improvements could be based on the use of images with higher spatial resolution that would allow the distinction between vegetation and bare soil gago et al 2015 or on the integration of different satellite platforms in order to increase temporal resolution shelestov et al 2017 ramírez cuesta et al 2019b which would allow a better characterization of the crop coefficient curve this fact is particularly relevant in areas frequently covered by clouds where only a few clear sky images are available during the entire growing season karlsen et al 2018 5 conclusion the arcdualkc model has provided reliable spatial distributed etc and kc and its components estimates by combining rs images and measured or predicted meteorological data despite significant errors were obtained in daily et0 estimates due to forecast inaccuracies of meteorological variables provided by cosmo model the use of forecast meteorological data resulted only in slight overestimates of kcb arcdualkc kc arcdualkc and etc when compared with the use of measured meteorological data in addition the arcdualkc model was able to identify the different irrigation treatments respect to kcb arcdualkc whereas no differences were found in ke arcdualkc estimates finally slight differences between 5 and 6 were obtained in terms of kc arcdualkc and etc in the irrigation control treatment and in the deficit irrigated ones the arcdualkc model can be then considered reliable for improving precision irrigation and water resource management in the context of deficit irrigation strategies including also the possibility of employing forecasted meteorological data as alternative of ground based observation of meteorological variables it is finally expected that the accuracies of the arcdualkc model in estimating etc will improve in the near future as its inputs are better characterized

10714,in the last years several satellite based models using measured or forecast meteorological data have been developed for determining spatially distributed crop evapotranspiration etc estimates the study herein presented aims at assessing the reliability of the arcdualkc model based on the fao 56 dual crop coefficient kc for deriving spatially distributed estimates of kc and etc in a deficit irrigated di orange orchard daily etc and dual kc values were obtained using sentinel 2 satellite imagery in combination with measured and forecast meteorological data provided by the nearest weather station and by cosmo model respectively overestimations on kc and etc resulted from the study when using forecast instead of measured meteorological data average pbias of 7 62 and 26 24 respectively this might be caused by some inaccuracies in meteorological predictions the evaporation coefficient ke derived by the arcdualkc model resulted similar between the di and the fully irrigated treatments differences up to 6 in terms of kc and etc were identified among the irrigation strategies mainly due to variations of the transpiration coefficient kcb despite the reliability of the arcdualkc model the obtained results might be influenced by the heterogeneity of sentinel 2 pixel containing vegetated and bare soil surfaces highlighting the need to integrate the model with ground based data or by using higher resolution images keywords remote sensing data modelling sentinel 2 crop coefficients precision irrigation 1 introduction irrigation contributes to the greatest amount of water consumption among several economic sectors dubois 2011 especially in semi arid areas where water deficit is a limiting factor for crop production singh et al 2017 a well scheduled and dosed irrigation regime is essential for matching crop water requirements gu et al 2017 and vice versa accurate estimations of crop evapotranspiration etc represent a significant proxy for scheduling irrigation gong et al 2019 several satellite based models have been developed in the last 30 years for determining spatially distributed etc estimates at different spatial scales zhang et al 2016 mokhtari et al 2018 olivera guerra et al 2018 ramírez cuesta et al 2019a in general these models are divided in two categories those based on the surface energy balance seb and those based on vegetation indexes vi the first category computes the latent heat flux and thus etc using ground based ancillary data and remotely sensed data in the visible vis near infrared nir and thermal tir portions of the electromagnetic spectrum zhang et al 2016 however the current limited spatial resolution in thermal domain restricts the use of these models at field scale especially when the plot size is smaller than the pixel resolution ramírez cuesta et al 2019a the second category of models computes etc from empirical site specific relationships between the fraction of ground covered by vegetation and vi derived from the canopy reflectance in vis and nir these models are usually based on the fao 56 approach allen et al 1998 which estimates etc by multiplying reference evapotranspiration et0 by a single or dual crop coefficient kc in the dual kc approach kc accounts for both plant transpiration t and soil evaporation e terms represented by a basal crop coefficient kcb and a soil evaporation coefficient ke respectively allen et al 1998 the dual kc approach is often applied for its simplicity and operational basis consoli et al 2016 olivera guerra et al 2018 in fact it requires few inputs including phenological stages irrigation amounts and standard meteorological data even if a site specific soil water balance is needed vanella et al 2019 however weather data when available are affected by large uncertainties since they are estimated by spatial interpolation of sparse meteorological ground stations lorite et al 2015 nowadays in order to overcome the limitation of available meteorological data numerical weather prediction models are used to provide reliable forecast data pelosi et al 2016 chirico et al 2018 across europe different consortiums provide meteorological

facing with extreme events chirico et al 2018 in this study spatially distributed estimates of kc and etc were retrieved at farm level by a geographic information system gis procedure integrated into the arcdualkc model ramírez cuesta et al 2019b which incorporated remote sensing rs and separately measured and forecast meteorological data within the fao 56 dual kc approach the main objectives of the study were i to assess the reliability of the arcdualkc model combined with forecast meteorological data provided by cosmo model for obtaining a priori spatially distributed kc and etc and ii to evaluate the arcdualkc model performance to predict et fluxes and kc values of deficit irrigated plots in semi arid mediterranean conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study was

usually considered as a tabulated value kcb tab i e 0 65 0 60 and 0 65 at initial middle and final stages respectively for citrus with 70 canopy and no ground cover in this study kcb arcdualkc was

pixels covering a sole irrigation treatment were used for extracting kc arcdualkc and its components kcb arcdualkc and ke arcdualkc and etc values from rs images in order to avoid edge pixel

slight differences may be observed between data obtained using measured or forecast meteorological data table 3 at full irrigation t1 kcb arcdualkc varied between 0 60 to 0 63 0 11 in all the di treatment t2 t4 and had a value of 0 64 in t1 full irrigation ke arcdualkc values were quite constant for all the irrigation treatments with values of 0 06 0 07 0 96 the underestimations observed in kcb at the di treatments resulted in lower kc arcdualkc and etc rates compared to the full irrigation up to 5 and 6 respectively with average kc arcdualkc of 0 67 0 69 0 14 0 15 versus 0 70 0 14 respectively etc values were in the range 4 56 4 74 0 34 0 35 mm d 1 in the di treatment versus 4 83 0 34 mm d 1 in t1 the obtained results were quite similar using measured meteorological data as input for computing the kcb arcdualkc with values of 0 59 0 08 in t1 and varying from 0 56 to 0 58 0 08 0 11 in the di treatments t2 t4 no differences between t1 and t2 t4 were observed in terms of ke arcdualkc with aa mean of 0 06 0 87 0 93 kc arcdualkc and etc values t2 t4 decreased up to 6 in the di treatments if compared to t1 with average kc arcdualkc of 0 62 0 64 0 11 0 14 in t2 t4 versus 0 65 0 11 in t1 and average etc of 3 6 3 7 mm d 1 0 33 in t2 t4 versus 3 8 mm d 1 0 32 in t1 4 discussion the kcb arcdualkc values obtained in the study were lower than those tabulated by the fao 56 paper and adjusted during the development and final phenological stages for local meteorological conditions the observed discrepancies were mainly caused by the model calibration procedure which selects within the full irrigation treatment t1 pixels that better represent potential irrigation conditions i e maximum savi and fc on the contrary kcb arcdualkc values on mid plant stage resulted higher than kcb tab mainly due to the specificity of the local climate condition consoli et al 2006a characterised by semi arid mediterranean climate conditions that most probably does not match the sub humid climate conditions with rhmin of about 45 and with calm to moderate u2 of 2 m s 1 at the base of kcb adj calculation in fact more arid climate conditions with greater wind speed would result in higher values of kcb adj allen et al 1998 several authors have reported higher values for kcb adj respect to kcb tab highlighting the crucial role of the specific climatic adjustment of kcb tab values benli et al 2006 paço et al 2006 however kcb arcdualkc values resulted lower than kcb adj during the middle season as consequence of the model calibration procedure effect identified also in the other phenological stages thus kcb is influenced by the vegetation reflectance condition occurred at the field site within the first arcdualkc sub model it was computed as a function of fc and savi resulting in smaller values respect to the kcb adj values in the present study the arcdualkc model was able to distinguish the different irrigation treatments supplied at the study site in terms of kcb arcdualkc as indicator of transpiration due to the imposed water deficit conditions comstock 2002 thus results showed kcb arcdualkc values up to 6 higher in full irrigation t1 respect to di treatments t2 t4 on the contrary no differences were observed in ke arcdualkc terms since the evaporation process occurs on a limited extension referred to the surface wetted by the drippers that in the arcdualkc model is assumed to be constant independently of the irrigation treatment the above mentioned discrepancies among treatments mainly in terms of kcb arcdualkc led to differences of 5 in kc arcdualkc and 6 in etc estimates between the full irrigation t1 and the di treatments t2 t4 these results confirm that as suggested by other authors rallo et al 2014 2017 agro hydrological models can be considered as an easy to use tool for indirect evaluations of soil and crop water status the use of forecast meteorological data for a priori etc estimations could be useful for providing irrigation advices to farmers in operative scenarios since it allows to plan irrigation water supply based on expected realistic meteorological conditions rather than on past and or current meteorological data chirico et al 2018 in this study kcb arcdualkc values computed using forecast meteorological data rh and u2 as input resulted 8 higher than those obtained using measured weather data this can be due to the uncertainties in the agro meteorological forecasted parameters which are used in the arcdualkc model tair rh rs u2 p the application of cosmo model has produced overestimation of tair 8 u2 31 and p up to 100 whereas it has underestimated rh and rs 26 and 11 respectively several authors reported the same behaviour in their studies luo et al 2014 xiong et al 2016 yang et al 2016 however even if large inaccuracies were observed in some agrometeorological variables the estimates of kcb arcdualkc using forecast data did not differ too much 8 from those values obtained by using the measured data as a consequence of the compensation of the expected error i e the underestimation of rh of 26 was offset by an overestimation of u2 up 31 furthermore the inaccuracies in the predicted agrometeorological variables also influenced the et0 estimates calculated with the penman monteith equation resulting in an overestimation of up to 17 despite this overestimation using weather forecasted data still has the advantage that farmers can anticipate their irrigation scheduling to near future weather conditions in terms of lead time a different behaviour was observed for the values of ke arcdualkc which showed an increase in the trend from 1 day to 3 days table 3 mainly due to an increase in the occurrence of the precipitations predicted by cosmo model from 1 to 3 days the onset of precipitation increased by about 50 figs 4 5 consequently the lead time had a slight effect on kc arcdualkc and etc with discrepancies less than 2 between lead times of 1 day and 3 days table 3 this decreasing trend in the accuracy of the single agrometeorological prediction variable has also benn observed in other studies lorite et al 2015 pelosi et al 2016 xiong et al 2016 cao et al 2019 who found differences up to 25 in u2 lorite et al 2015 when the forecast horizon increased from 1 to 3 days despite the reliability of arcdualkc in modelling etc at field level the results could be influenced by the pixel size of sentinel 2 which contains both vegetated and bare soil surfaces in this sense the arcdualkc model could be improved by integrating the data obtained from ground measurements e g electrical resistivity tomography ert lisimetry sap flow and eddy covariance motisi et al 2012 consoli and papa 2013 to obtain more accurate soil parameters campos et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 vanella et al 2019 or more reliable crop coefficient values instead of using those tabulated on fao 56 paper consoli et al 2006b peddinti and kambhammettu 2019 this information would help to better understand the specificity of the site increasing the accuracy of the etc estimates other improvements could be based on the use of images with higher spatial resolution that would allow the distinction between vegetation and bare soil gago et al 2015 or on the integration of different satellite platforms in order to increase temporal resolution shelestov et al 2017 ramírez cuesta et al 2019b which would allow a better characterization of the crop coefficient curve this fact is particularly relevant in areas frequently covered by clouds where only a few clear sky images are available during the entire growing season karlsen et al 2018 5 conclusion the arcdualkc model has provided reliable spatial distributed etc and kc and its components estimates by combining rs images and measured or predicted meteorological data despite significant errors were obtained in daily et0 estimates due to forecast inaccuracies of meteorological variables provided by cosmo model the use of forecast meteorological data resulted only in slight overestimates of kcb arcdualkc kc arcdualkc and etc when compared with the use of measured meteorological data in addition the arcdualkc model was able to identify the different irrigation treatments respect to kcb arcdualkc whereas no differences were found in ke arcdualkc estimates finally slight differences between 5 and 6 were obtained in terms of kc arcdualkc and etc in the irrigation control treatment and in the deficit irrigated ones the arcdualkc model can be then considered reliable for improving precision irrigation and water resource management in the context of deficit irrigation strategies including also the possibility of employing forecasted meteorological data as alternative of ground based observation of meteorological variables it is finally expected that the accuracies of the arcdualkc model in estimating etc will improve in the near future as its inputs are better characterized both reducing the uncertainties of the prediction models and increasing the spatial and temporal resolutions of remote sensing data acknowledgments the authors thank the eu the italian ministry of
