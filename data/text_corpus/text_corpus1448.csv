7240,a number of previous studies have examined relations between groundwater levels and hydrologic and meteorological variables over parts of the glacial aquifer system but systematic analyses across the entire u s glacial aquifer system are lacking we tested correlations between monthly groundwater levels measured at 1043 wells in the u s glacial aquifer system considered to be minimally influenced by human disturbance and selected hydrologic and meteorological variables with the goal of extending historical groundwater records where there were strong correlations groundwater levels in the east region correlated most strongly with short term 1 and 3 month averages of hydrologic and meteorological variables while those in the central and west central regions yielded stronger correlations with hydrologic and meteorological variables averaged over longer time intervals 6 12 months variables strongly correlated with high and low annual groundwater levels were identified as candidate records for use in statistical linear models as a means to fill in and extend historical high and low groundwater levels respectively overall 37 4 of study wells meeting data criteria had successful models for high and or low groundwater levels these wells shared characteristics of relatively higher local precipitation higher local land surface slope lower amounts of clay within the surficial sediments and higher base flow index streamflow and base flow served as explanatory variables in about two thirds of both high and low groundwater level models in all three regions and generally yielded more and better models compared to precipitation and palmer drought severity index the use of variables such as streamflow with substantially longer and more complete records than those of groundwater wells provide a means for placing contemporary groundwater levels in a longer historical context and can support site specific analyses such as groundwater modeling keywords groundwater hydrology streamflow base flow palmer drought index precipitation 1 introduction the glacial aquifer system in the united states includes all unconsolidated aquifers above bedrock north of the line of continental glaciation across parts of 26 states in the northern conterminous u s and alaska fig 1 warner and arnold 2006 warner and ayotte 2014 the area of continental glaciation fig 1 comprises a heterogeneous mixture of glacial sediments with varied hydraulic properties ranging from fine grained unsorted glacial till low hydraulic conductivity to coarse grained sand and gravel glacial outwash high conductivity warner and ayotte 2014 the highly permeable and porous glacial sand and gravel deposits in the glacial aquifer system are among the most productive in the nation providing the largest public supply and self supplied industrial withdrawals of all principal aquifers in the u s maupin and barber 2005 u s geological survey 2003 efficient use and management of groundwater resources depends upon understanding the relations of groundwater with precipitation input surface water and measures of drought there are a few studies that have examined relations between groundwater levels and hydrologic and meteorological variables over large regions of the glacial aquifer system li et al 2015 examined groundwater variability in 181 u s geological survey usgs wells in the central and eastern u s some of which intersected with the geographic range of the glacial aquifer system massachusetts long island pennsylvania and the upper mississippi they correlated precipitation and modeled recharge with groundwater storage anomalies and found seasonal and inter annual variability positively correlated with hydro climatic variability groundwater storage anomalies more strongly correlated with modeled monthly recharge than precipitation perez valdivia et al 2012 tested for climatic teleconnections and correlations between meteorological variables and standardized groundwater levels measured at 21 shallow 20 m wells in the canadian prairie provinces considered to be relatively free of pumping effects the prairie provinces share boundaries with montana north dakota and minnesota fig 1 their correlation analyses indicated groundwater levels at most wells in the prairie were significantly positively correlated with precipitation at generally 12 month lags and significantly negatively correlated with air temperature at generally 5 month lags particularly during the warm months of may to october the study documented in this article tested regional relations between groundwater levels and selected hydrologic and meteorological variables across the entire u s glacial aquifer system this work was done as a complement to the analysis by hodgkins et al 2017a of groundwater trends in the u s glacial aquifer system 1964 2013 these papers make use of much of the same data but each use independent analyses and have different objectives correlation testing included precipitation and air temperature as previous studies but we also included nearby streamflow and base flow and palmer drought severity index pdsi as potential correlates groundwater records were correlated strongly with streamflow records in a study of groundwater trends in northern new england dudley and hodgkins 2013 we also tested correlations with pdsi because it represents soil moisture conditions and could therefore serve as a useful explanatory variable to describe the variability of groundwater levels in shallow aquifers like the glacial aquifer system for variables with correlations between glacial aquifer groundwater levels and meteorological and hydrologic variables across the northern u s we then identified those variables that may be useful for filling in and extending high and low groundwater levels at locations where groundwater records may be relatively short or fragmented longer term meteorological or hydrologic records may serve as useful proxy measures of groundwater estimating missing historical groundwater levels can provide necessary information to place current conditions and contemporary trends into historical context we make a novel application of maintenance of variance linear models to estimate historical annual levels during specifically identified months when annual high or low levels most frequently occur in the u s glacial aquifer system this approach was chosen to constrain the hydrological process associated with a particular high or low level at any given well for example low winter levels associated with frozen precipitation and soils as opposed to low late summer or fall groundwater levels associated with seasonal evapotranspiration 2 data and methods 2 1 groundwater levels study wells in the glacial aquifer system fig 2 were selected from the usgs national water information system nwis u s geological survey 2016 and the national groundwater monitoring network ngwmn u s geological survey center for integrated data analytics 2016 databases the methods used for study well selection and assembly of end of month eom time series of groundwater level data representing the potentiometric surface of the aquifer for each well is described by hodgkins et al 2017a in summary study wells were required to be in or near the bounds of the glacial aquifer system and indicate completion in an aquifer considered glacial in origin all eom groundwater level data were formatted consistently such that high water levels indicated a potentiometric surface nearer to land surface than lower levels highly correlated wells in close proximity to each other 40 km were removed from the analysis to reduce duplication of groundwater level information a minimum data completeness requirement was applied to all candidate wells requiring at least 10 years consecutive or non consecutive of data for any given month for the purposes of interannual correlation testing in general wells in the east region had the most data available and the amount of data decreased from east to west fig 3 2 2 human influence classification this study required the identification of wells in the glacial aquifer system for which groundwater levels may be considered to be minimally influenced by human activity methods used for identifying the relative amounts of potential human influence are described in detail by hodgkins et al 2017a in summary nationally available land cover data homer et al 2015 in proximity to wells and county water use data maupin et al 2014 were used to develop an index of potential human influence comprising four individual metrics and then verified or corrected by local usgs experts hodgkins et al 2017a resulting index scores at each well classified potential human influence into four categories minimal transitional low transitional high and high a subset of 1043 wells of the 2228 candidates were classified as having either minimal or transitional low human influence potential this subset was used for this study fig 2 the final human influence potential category for all candidate study wells along with land use and water use data at and near the wells are provided as supplemental material located in a data release hodgkins et al 2017b 2 3 streamflow the usgs hydroclimatic data network version 2009 hcdn 2009 subset of usgs streamflow gages measure streamflow on rivers considered to be minimally influenced by human disturbance and primarily reflect meteorological conditions lins 2012 hcdn 2009 gages are identified in the geospatial attributes of gages for evaluating streamflow version 2 gages ii dataset falcone 2011 daily streamflow data collected at hcdn 2009 gages were obtained from nwis u s geological survey 2016 through water year 2013 wells were paired with their nearest hcdn 2009 gage on the basis of distance to the nearest river basin boundary for the purpose of correlation testing of groundwater levels with streamflows if they were within 50 km distances between wells and hcdn 2009 drainage basin boundaries were computed using a geographic information system gis 740 of 1043 wells were within 50 km of 98 hcdn 2009 basins median distance 17 8 km daily base flow values for the gages were computed from daily streamflow data using the local minimum method automated in the computer program hysep hydrograph separation sloto and crouse 1996 using hysep ensured that base flow separation was consistently applied to all streamflow records across all time periods monthly mean streamflows and base flows were computed from daily streamflows and base flows respectively for complete months only moving seasonal 3 month semi annual 6 month and annual mean streamflows and base flows were computed from the monthly means regional hydrologic studies of winter spring streamflows predominantly comprised of snowmelt runoff and rain have demonstrated trends toward significantly earlier runoff timing in northern and mountainous sections of the u s glacial aquifer system during the 20th century dudley et al 2017a u s environmental protection agency 2016 hodgkins and dudley 2006 hodgkins et al 2003 the winter spring center volume date wscvd is a measure of snowmelt related streamflow timing the wscvd is the date from the start of the winter spring period by which half or more of the seasonal volume has flowed past a streamflow gaging station for this study wscvd was computed for each year at each gage using methods consistent with previous studies dudley et al 2017a hodgkins and dudley 2006 u s environmental protection agency 2016 for the seasonal period january 1 to june 30 2 4 precipitation and air temperature monthly precipitation and temperature data were obtained from the u s historical climatology network version 2 5 0 20140919 ushcnv2 5 dataset national oceanic and atmospheric administration 2014 through water year 2013 ushcn stations are quality controlled and evaluated on the basis of historical stability and record length and completeness monthly data are computed from daily data from the global historical climatology network ghcn menne et al 2012 that have passed quality control checks set forth by durre et al 2010 there were no ushcn stations in alaska monthly precipitation and air temperature data from ghcn stations in anchorage usw00026451 ted stevens international airport and usw00026409 merrill field were used to assemble time series from december 1943 to september 2013 national oceanic and atmospheric administration 2016 study wells were paired with their nearest meteorological station if 75 km apart using gis for the purpose of correlation testing of groundwater levels with precipitation and air temperature 898 of 1043 wells were within 75 km of 176 meteorological stations median distance 34 0 km 612 wells had both a streamflow gage and a meteorological station meeting proximity criteria moving seasonal 3 month semi annual 6 month and annual total precipitation and mean air temperatures were computed using monthly values 2 5 palmer drought severity index and base flow index palmer drought severity index pdsi is a standardized measure of local soil moisture conditions computed using monthly precipitation air temperature and estimated soil moisture capacity palmer 1965 alley 1984 szép et al 2005 monthly pdsi values computed for noaa climate divisions in the conterminous u s national oceanic and atmospheric administration 2015a were obtained from the noaa national centers for environmental information website national oceanic and atmospheric administration 2015b through water year 2013 for the purpose of correlation testing of groundwater levels with pdsi wells were paired with the climate division in which they are located the 1043 candidate wells occupied 84 climate divisions seasonal semi annual and annual averages of pdsi were not computed because pdsi already represents a long term integrated measure of hydrologic conditions base flow index bfi the ratio of annual base flow to total streamflow was spatially interpolated from point estimates of bfi at usgs streamgages for the conterminous u s by wolock 2003a 2 6 correlations all inter annual correlation testing was done using pearson s product moment correlation coefficient r the correlations were considered significant at p 0 05 a minimum of n 10 were required for any correlation test inter annual correlations tested monthly end of month groundwater levels against monthly and moving seasonal 3 month semi annual 6 month and annual means of streamflow base flow and air temperature and totals of precipitation monthly groundwater levels also were tested against same month values of pdsi and previous month groundwater levels lagged by one month groundwater levels for july through december were tested against winter spring streamflow timing which was computed on the basis of streamflow data from january 1 to june 30 2 7 historical groundwater level estimation models linear models relating meteorological and hydrologic variables with groundwater levels were derived using the maintenance of variance extension type 1 move 1 technique hirsch 1982 also referred to as the line of organic correlation helsel and hirsch 2002 the move 1 linear model is derived from the relation between the common time period of two records the model can then be used to produce estimates of the dependent variable on the basis of observations of the independent variable the move 1 technique maintains the variance of the estimates thereby yielding estimates with a statistical distribution similar to that expected had the dependent variable actually been measured helsel and hirsch 2002 the slope of the move 1 line is the ratio of the standard deviations of the two records eq 1 and produces a unique line that is the same regardless of which variable is used as the dependent variable helsel and hirsch 2002 a minimum of n 20 overlapping observations between groundwater levels and an independent variable were required to derive a candidate move 1 model 1 y i y sign r s y s x x i x where y i and x i are the ith measurements of the dependent and independent variables respectively y and x are mean of y and x sign r is the sign of the correlation between y and x and sy and sx are standard deviations of y and x move 1 models were derived for selected month end values representing the most common months of occurrence of high and low groundwater levels at each well only wells with an average data density of six monthly levels per year or more during their periods of record were used in this analysis 497 of 1043 47 7 of wells passed the data density criterion table 1 we did not use the annual maximum and minimum groundwater levels because they can represent different processes for example winter low levels are typically related to extended cold periods with water in snowpack rather than recharging groundwater and summer low levels are typically caused by extended dry periods we defined high groundwater levels for qualifying study wells as the highest 25th percentile groundwater levels for the entire period of record computed on the basis of detrended groundwater levels using a loess moving average curve with a smoothing window span of 0 3 among those levels we then identified the most frequent month associated with these high groundwater levels figs 4 and 5 the same procedure was used to define low groundwater levels on the basis of the lowest 25th percentile levels figs 4 and 5 candidate independent variables included monthly and moving seasonal 3 month semi annual and annual means of streamflow base flow air temperature and precipitation totals and monthly pdsi values the data release by hodgkins et al 2017b tabulates the nearest usgs hcdn 2009 streamflow gage streamflow and baseflow nearest hcn meteorological station air temperature and precipitation and noaa climate division pdsi used for each well the derived move 1 models were required to pass several diagnostic tests in order to be considered successful the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse statistic eq 2 was used as a measure of move 1 model performance it is a normalized statistic that provides a measure of how well model output matches measured data nash and sutcliffe 1970 moriasi et al 2007 2 nse 1 1 n i 1 n q obs i q move i 2 1 n i 1 n q obs i q obs i 2 where q obs i is the ith measurement of the groundwater level q move i is the ith model estimated level q o b s i is the mean of the measured levels and n is the total number of measured levels nse ranges in value from negative infinity through 1 0 a value of 0 0 or less indicates that the mean of the measured values is a better predictor than the model estimated values values between 0 0 and 1 0 are viewed as acceptable with 1 0 indicating a perfect match between every measured and model estimated value moriasi et al 2007 move 1 models for this study were required to have nse 0 50 to be considered a successful model additional diagnostic screening required that model residuals were not significantly p 0 05 autocorrelated lag 1 or significantly p 0 05 correlated with time groundwater level or independent variable addressing heteroscedasticity if a well had more than one move 1 model passing the above diagnostic screening the best model was chosen on the basis of the highest nse value 3 results and discussion results are subset into four regions within the glacial aquifer system defined by warner and arnold 2006 that share similar physiography east central west central and west fig 1 these regions have been delineated on the basis of similar environmental and hydrogeologic features that affect the rate of groundwater input and flow including topography precipitation sediment thickness and composition hydraulic properties and direction of glacial advance during the last glacial period warner and ayotte 2014 3 1 correlations many relations between groundwater levels and hydrologic and meteorological variables in the glacial aquifer system varied along an east west gradient the percentage of significant correlations of groundwater levels with the level of the preceding month table 2 lvl 1 was lowest in the east region increased in the central region and increased for most months again in the west central region wells in the central and west central regions exhibited greater persistence less month to month variability in their groundwater levels the percentage of wells with significant correlations between groundwater levels and pdsi decreased from the east to west central regions 3 1 1 east a large majority of the 204 qualifying study wells in the east region were among the shallowest wells in the glacial aquifer system with a median depth of 8 3 m 27 2 ft 93 of the wells were less than 30 5 m 100 ft deep fig 6 a in general the glacial deposits in the east region are predominantly coarse grained warner and ayotte 2014 this can promote relatively rapid rates of groundwater flow when combined with relatively high topographic relief fig 6b and the most humid climate of all the regions fig 6c warner and ayotte 2014 these characteristics result in groundwater levels that exhibited greater month to month variability and significant correlations most often with shorter 1 and 3 month measures of hydrologic and meteorological variables table 2a than groundwater levels observed in the other regions of the glacial aquifer system for example the highest percentage of significant correlations between groundwater levels and streamflow in the east were with 1 to 3 month average streamflows whereas the highest percentage of correlations in the central and west central regions were generally with 3 to 12 month average streamflows table 2a high groundwater levels defined in data and methods historical groundwater level estimation models section most commonly occurred during march april at wells in the east region figs 4 and 5 as a result of recharge provided by precipitation and melt of accumulated winter snowpack occurrence of high groundwater levels in other months of the year except may was rare high groundwater levels were significantly correlated with streamflow and base flow at 52 68 of wells most frequently with the same month 1 month means table 2a indicating a strong connection between the generally shallow aquifers in this region and surface water pdsi was significantly correlated with groundwater levels at a majority of wells in general high groundwater levels correlated with air temperature at few wells groundwater levels in the east region exhibited high month to month persistence during august and september when levels were most commonly at their lowest table 2 fig 4 during these months groundwater discharge from the relatively shallow glacial deposits in the east can contribute substantially to streamflow a relation reflected in the high percentage of significant correlations between low groundwater levels and same month or seasonal 3 month streamflow and base flow table 2a average correlation coefficients were generally between 0 6 and 0 7 table 2b dudley and hodgkins 2013 also observed that late summer groundwater levels in northern new england correlated strongly with contemporaneous streamflow and base flow in the current study low groundwater levels during august and september were significantly correlated with pdsi and 6 to 12 month antecedent precipitation at two thirds or more of wells table 2a low groundwater levels were significantly related to air temperature at a very small percentage of wells indicating that air temperature does not play a major role in warm season low groundwater levels although substantial recharge occurs during spring with the melt of accumulated winter snowpack few wells in the region indicated correlation between summer and fall groundwater levels and winter spring snowmelt related runoff timing wscvd 3 1 2 central the 81 study wells in the central region were generally deeper than those in the east region with a median depth of 17 4 m 57 1 ft 80 5 of the wells were less than 30 5 m 100 ft deep fig 6a glacial deposits in the central region are generally composed of thick sequences of coarse and fine grained glacial sediments and are overall thicker than those in the east with some locations such as northern indiana having extensive glacial sediments hundreds of feet thick warner and ayotte 2014 and michigan with deposits up to 305 m 1000 ft thick in some areas warner and arnold 2006 topographic relief throughout the central region is representative of a transition between the high relief of the east region and the plains in the west central region fig 6b the climate in the central region is considered humid although drier than the east region fig 6c warner and ayotte 2014 these characteristics result in groundwater levels that generally exhibit less month to month variability than levels in the east region groundwater levels in the central region generally correlated most strongly with long term 6 and 12 month measures of hydrologic and meteorological variables table 2a high groundwater levels most commonly occurred during april at wells in the central region fig 4 although some of the most northern wells exhibited high groundwater levels most commonly in later spring or early summer months fig 5 the highest percentage of significant correlations between april groundwater levels and other variables were with 6 month mean streamflow and base flow table 2a correlation with streamflow explained on average nearly half of the variability r 2 0 498 mean correlation coefficient 0 706 in april levels table 2b april levels by contrast correlated with 3 month air temperature at only 10 of wells table 2a low groundwater levels in the central region most commonly occurred during two times of the year winter centered on february and late summer centered on september fig 4 wells for which low groundwater levels most frequently occurred in january april were all located in northern wisconsin and michigan figs 1 and 5 low levels during july october predominantly occurred in the southern part of the central region fig 5 february groundwater levels in the central region correlated at most wells with seasonal 3 month streamflow and annual mean 12 month base flow this contrasts with the high percentage of significant correlations with 1 month streamflows and base flows in the east table 2a september low groundwater levels correlated most often with annual mean streamflow and seasonal base flow about half 46 and 50 of the variability in february and september groundwater levels was explained on average by streamflow table 2b low groundwater levels correlated with air temperature at few wells for both february and september similar to the east region few wells in the region had significant correlations between warm season groundwater levels and winter spring snowmelt related streamflow timing 3 1 3 west central the 731 study wells in the west central region were generally deeper than those in the east and central regions with a median depth of 24 4 m 80 1 ft about a quarter of the wells 24 7 were equal to or greater than 45 7 m 150 ft deep fig 6a similar to the central region glacial deposits in the west central region are generally composed of thick sequences of coarse and fine grained glacial sediments that include carbonate material warner and ayotte 2014 topography of the west central region is predominantly flat with some local topographic relief provided by moraines and drumlins formed by glacial processes fig 6b warner and ayotte 2014 mean annual precipitation in the west central region is much lower than the east and central regions fig 6c with a semiarid climate in the plains of nebraska north and south dakota and montana fig 1 warner and ayotte 2014 widely distributed unsorted fine grained surficial sediments in this region are characterized by lower permeability of surficial sediments than the other regions fig 7 warner and ayotte 2014 attributed longer groundwater residence time in the west central region compared to the east and central regions to greater depths to the water table drier climatic conditions and lower rates of groundwater recharge in general monthly groundwater levels in the west central region correlated most strongly with long term 6 and 12 month measures of hydrologic and meteorological variables high groundwater levels most commonly occurred during april may at wells in the west central region fig 4 aside from the preceding month groundwater level the highest percentage of significant correlations between april and may groundwater levels and other variables was with annual mean streamflows and base flows table 2a correlation with these variables explained on average 45 49 of the variability in groundwater levels table 2b low groundwater levels in the west central region most commonly occurred during july august although low levels occurred at many wells during winter and early spring january march fig 4 unlike the central region wells for which low levels most frequently occurred in january march were not limited to the northernmost part of the region but rather located throughout the west central region well depth was a distinguishing factor between wells with low levels during winter and those during summer on the basis of a wilcoxon rank sum test p 0 0001 wells with january march low levels were shallower median well depth 12 2 m than the wells with july september low levels median depth 28 6 m july and august groundwater levels had significant correlations with annual averages of streamflow and base flow at about half of wells table 2a groundwater levels generally were correlated with precipitation and pdsi at many fewer wells groundwater levels correlated with air temperature at less than 15 of wells among all months like other regions few wells in the west central region had significant correlations between july and august groundwater levels and winter spring streamflow timing 3 1 4 west few wells n 27 fig 3 in the west region met record length and completeness and human influence potential criteria the 27 study wells in the west region were generally the deepest in the glacial aquifer system with a median depth of 50 9 m 167 ft fig 6a topography in the west region is hilly and mountainous although the mean land surface slope in the vicinity of the study wells in this region is generally low as most glacial material was deposited in the valleys of the mountainous terrain fig 6b warner and ayotte 2014 the climate is arid in the vicinity of most of the study wells in the west region except for the wells in washington and alaska fig 1 fig 6c glacial surficial sediments in the vicinity of these wells reflected a wide range of permeability fig 7 the small number of wells that passed the data length and completeness criteria precluded most monthly correlation tests table 2 only 4 wells 1 in western montana 2 in northern idaho and 1 near anchorage alaska fig 5 met the data density criterion precluding plots of frequency of occurrence of high and low groundwater levels fig 4 the number of qualifying wells is too small for robust results on the amount of groundwater level variability explained by hydrologic and meteorological variables 3 2 estimation of historical groundwater levels using proxy records strong correlations between groundwater levels and hydrologic and meteorological variables suggest that statistical models may be useful for estimating historical groundwater levels zhuoheng et al 2002 demonstrated successful application of statistical models to estimate mean annual groundwater levels in the upper carbonate aquifer in southern manitoba canada using explanatory variables of precipitation and air temperature our study derived move 1 models to estimate month end groundwater level values for months when high and low groundwater levels most commonly occurred at each qualifying well some 67 wells 37 4 of all study wells qualifying for both data density and minimum data criteria yielded 91 successful models for either high or low groundwater level models table 1 24 wells had both a successful high and low groundwater level model derived the greatest rate of derivation of successful models was for wells in the central region 55 2 of all qualifying wells and the least in the west central region 25 6 only 4 wells in the west region met the data density criterion and none met the minimum data criterion 3 2 1 high groundwater levels successful high groundwater level models table 3 example shown in fig 8 had an overall mean nash sutcliffe efficiency statistic nse of 0 66 with a mean nse of 0 67 among wells in the east and mean nse scores of 0 64 at wells in the central and west central regions streamflow and base flow were the most common explanatory variables across all regions table 3 remaining models used precipitation or pdsi a majority of high groundwater level models in the east region used streamflow or base flow as the explanatory variable which generally yielded the strongest models overall on the basis of a mean nse of 0 68 for streamflow and 0 77 for base flow among those the majority of models used same month 1 month streamflow or base flow as the best explanatory variable second to streamflow and base flow precipitation was the explanatory variable for 6 of 28 models yielding models with a mean nse of 0 61 3 of the 6 models used same month 1 month precipitation as the best explanatory variable these 6 wells in the east region were the only high groundwater level models that used precipitation as an explanatory variable among all the regions pdsi was used in 3 of the 28 models and with a mean nse of 0 65 more than three quarters of high groundwater level models in the central region used streamflow or base flow as the explanatory variable mean nse of 0 67 for streamflow 0 61 for base flow a majority of models used annual mean streamflow or base flow as the best explanatory variable the remaining models in the central region used pdsi and yielded the lowest mean nse 0 56 for the region the semi arid climate and aquifer characteristics such as greater depth to water thicker unsaturated zone in the west central region precluded derivation of many successful models base flow and streamflow were the most common explanatory variables in the west central region mean nse 0 63 and a single model used pdsi 3 2 2 low groundwater levels successful low groundwater level models table 4 example shown in fig 9 had an overall mean nse of 0 66 with mean nses of 0 67 0 65 and 0 63 in the east central and west central regions respectively successful low groundwater level model derivation rate for wells in the west central region was greater 30 0 than the success rate for derivation of high groundwater level models in that region 14 3 streamflow and base flow were the most common explanatory variables across all regions table 4 remaining models used precipitation or pdsi half of the low groundwater level models for wells in the east region used streamflow or base flow as the explanatory variable mean nse 0 67 and nearly all of the remaining models used 3 to 12 month totals of precipitation mean nse 0 64 the best nse scores were associated with wells where same month streamflow annual total precipitation or pdsi mean nse 0 78 served as the best explanatory variables most of the low groundwater level models for wells in the central region used streamflow or base flow as the explanatory variable mean nse 0 68 and yielded models with the highest nse scores in the region the remaining models used 3 month total of precipitation nse 0 53 or pdsi mean nse 0 59 as explanatory variables two thirds of successful low groundwater level models in the west central region used streamflow or base flow as the explanatory variable which yielded a mean nse of 0 65 models using 1 and 3 month mean streamflow had the highest nse scores in the region the remaining 3 models used pdsi mean nse 0 58 or annual total precipitation nse 0 63 as the explanatory variable 3 2 3 characteristics of successful models characteristics common to wells with successful models for high or low groundwater levels as opposed to wells without successful models wilcoxon rank sum test with p 0 0001 included relatively higher precipitation relatively higher local land surface slope relatively lower amounts of clay composing surficial sediments and relatively higher base flow index the ratio of annual base flow to total streamflow fig 10 well depth was not a distinguishing characteristic successful low groundwater level models shared the clay fraction and bfi characteristics mentioned above while successful high groundwater level models shared all four high land surface slope and permeability of surficial sediments low clay content contribute to relatively high responsiveness of groundwater levels to precipitation and to hydraulic connectivity with surface waters the statistical modeling approach described in this article for estimating historical high and low groundwater levels using proxy records is likely applicable in other surficial aquifer systems with similar climatic and geologic characteristics 4 summary and conclusions we document regional correlations between monthly groundwater levels from 1043 wells throughout the glacial aquifer system in the u s with selected hydrologic and meteorological variables and identify candidate variables that may be useful for estimating high and low groundwater levels to augment short or fragmentary records study wells were carefully evaluated for human influence potential on the basis of water use and land use data and input from local usgs groundwater specialists only wells with minimal or low human influence potential were selected for study streamflow data were likewise screened for minimal human influence and meteorological data were selected for their quality and use in long term climatological studies consequently the documented relations reflect environmental conditions relatively free from human land and water use impacts variability in groundwater levels across the glacial aquifer system is controlled by precipitation evapotranspiration surficial soil and aquifer properties and topographic relief in the vicinity of the wells relations between groundwater levels and hydrologic and meteorological variables in the glacial aquifer system varied along an east west gradient correlations of groundwater levels with the level of the preceding month indicate general east to west increase in persistence in groundwater time series in the east region high topographic relief a humid climate and mostly shallow coarse grained aquifer materials contribute to relatively high responsiveness of groundwater levels to precipitation and groundwater levels with greater month to month variability than other regions of the glacial aquifer system groundwater levels in the east region correlated most strongly with short term 1 and 3 month averages of hydrologic and meteorological variables in the central and west central regions of the glacial aquifer system flatter topography less permeable surficial geology and greater aquifer thickness yielded stronger correlations with hydrologic and meteorological variables averaged over longer time intervals especially for wells in more arid parts of the glacial aquifer system plains of nebraska north and south dakota and montana li et al 2015 similarly observed greater lag between regional mean groundwater storage and monthly precipitation in arid regions high groundwater levels most commonly occurred during spring months of march may across the glacial aquifer system as a result of recharge provided by precipitation and melting of accumulated winter snowpack high groundwater levels significantly correlated with streamflow and base flow at a majority of wells for all regions there were generally few significant correlations between high groundwater levels and air temperature in all regions there was greater variability in the months of the annual low groundwater levels than months of high levels low levels most commonly occurred during summer early fall months of july september across the glacial aquifer system as a result of evapotranspiration winter early spring january march low groundwater levels were relatively common among wells in the central and west central regions particularly in northern wisconsin and michigan where precipitation in the winter is generally stored as snow notably there were few correlations with summer early fall low groundwater levels and timing of snowmelt runoff across all regions low groundwater levels during august and september were significantly correlated with streamflow base flow precipitation or pdsi at more than two thirds of the wells in the east region for the central region september groundwater levels correlated with streamflow and base flow at about two thirds of wells the strongest correlations in the west central region between july and august groundwater levels and other variables were with streamflow and base flow for about half the wells in the region as was the case with high groundwater levels there were generally few correlations between low levels and air temperature in all regions indicating that the impact of evapotranspiration on groundwater levels is not greatly affected by the inter annual variability of temperatures or the effect is masked by other variables we investigated the use of maintenance of variance linear models to leverage the strong correlations between groundwater levels and hydrologic and meteorological variables as a means to fill in or extend year to year historical groundwater levels for selected months during which high and low levels most commonly occurred development of month specific models constrained the hydrological processes associated with a particular high or low level at any given well overall 37 4 of all study wells qualifying for both data density and minimum data criteria had one or more successful models derived for high and or low groundwater levels wells in the central region had the highest rate of successful model development 55 2 wells with successful models of either type high or low across the glacial aquifer system shared characteristics of relatively higher local precipitation higher local land surface slope lower amounts of clay within the surficial sediments and higher base flow index streamflow and base flow served as strong explanatory variables among successful models for both high and low groundwater level models these variables were in about two thirds of all models across all three regions between the two variables streamflow appeared most frequently in nearly half of all models streamflow was most frequent in models in the east and central regions but base flow was most frequent in models in the west central region the frequent appearance of streamflow and base flow as explanatory variables indicates streamflow data provide important information for estimating missing high and low groundwater levels short term measures of streamflow 1 to 3 month were most frequent for models in the east region while 6 to 12 month measures of streamflow were most frequent for models in the central and west central regions precipitation appeared in 20 of models most of which were in the east region and more frequently as an explanatory variable in low groundwater level models palmer drought severity index pdsi served as an explanatory variable in 13 of models in both high and low groundwater level models and appeared in models for all regions most frequently in the east region using statistical models to estimate long term historical groundwater levels can provide important historical context for interpreting shorter term trends and extreme events and can lengthen available historical datasets to support numerical analyses such as groundwater modeling e g mack 2009 or developing short term forecasting models dudley et al 2017b groundwater level models using proxy records also can provide insight into how climate change might impact groundwater resources if anticipated climate related

7240,a number of previous studies have examined relations between groundwater levels and hydrologic and meteorological variables over parts of the glacial aquifer system but systematic analyses across the entire u s glacial aquifer system are lacking we tested correlations between monthly groundwater levels measured at 1043 wells in the u s glacial aquifer system considered to be minimally influenced by human disturbance and selected hydrologic and meteorological variables with the goal of extending historical groundwater records where there were strong correlations groundwater levels in the east region correlated most strongly with short term 1 and 3 month averages of hydrologic and meteorological variables while those in the central and west central regions yielded stronger correlations with hydrologic and meteorological variables averaged over longer time intervals 6 12 months variables strongly correlated with high and low annual groundwater levels were identified as candidate records for use in statistical linear models as a means to fill in and extend historical high and low groundwater levels respectively overall 37 4 of study wells meeting data criteria had successful models for high and or low groundwater levels these wells shared characteristics of relatively higher local precipitation higher local land surface slope lower amounts of clay within the surficial sediments and higher base flow index streamflow and base flow served as explanatory variables in about two thirds of both high and low groundwater level models in all three regions and generally yielded more and better models compared to precipitation and palmer drought severity index the use of variables such as streamflow with substantially longer and more complete records than those of groundwater wells provide a means for placing contemporary groundwater levels in a longer historical context and can support site specific analyses such as groundwater modeling keywords groundwater hydrology streamflow base flow palmer drought index precipitation 1 introduction the glacial aquifer system in the united states includes all unconsolidated aquifers above bedrock north of the line of continental glaciation across parts of 26 states in the northern conterminous u s and alaska fig 1 warner and arnold 2006 warner and ayotte 2014 the area of continental glaciation fig 1 comprises a heterogeneous mixture of glacial sediments with varied hydraulic properties ranging from fine grained unsorted glacial till low hydraulic conductivity to coarse grained sand and gravel glacial outwash high conductivity warner and ayotte 2014 the highly permeable and porous glacial sand and gravel deposits in the glacial aquifer system are among the most productive in the nation providing the largest public supply and self supplied industrial withdrawals of all principal aquifers in the u s maupin and barber 2005 u s geological survey 2003 efficient use and management of groundwater resources depends upon understanding the relations of groundwater with precipitation input surface water and measures of drought there are a few studies that have examined relations between groundwater levels and hydrologic and meteorological variables over large regions of the glacial aquifer system li et al 2015 examined groundwater variability in 181 u s geological survey usgs wells in the central and eastern u s some of which intersected with the geographic range of the glacial aquifer system massachusetts long island pennsylvania and the upper mississippi they correlated precipitation and modeled recharge with groundwater storage anomalies and found seasonal and inter annual variability positively correlated with hydro climatic variability groundwater storage anomalies more strongly correlated with modeled monthly recharge than precipitation perez valdivia et al 2012 tested for climatic teleconnections and correlations between meteorological variables and standardized groundwater levels measured at 21 shallow 20 m wells in the canadian prairie provinces considered to be relatively free of pumping effects the prairie provinces share boundaries with montana north dakota and minnesota fig 1 their correlation analyses indicated groundwater levels at most wells in the prairie were significantly positively correlated with precipitation at generally 12 month lags and significantly negatively correlated with air temperature at generally 5 month lags particularly during the warm months of may to october the study documented in this article tested regional relations between groundwater levels and selected hydrologic and meteorological variables across the entire u s glacial aquifer system this work was done as a complement to the analysis by hodgkins et al 2017a of groundwater trends in the u s glacial aquifer system 1964 2013 these papers make use of much of the same data but each use independent analyses and have different objectives correlation testing included precipitation and air temperature as previous studies but we also included nearby streamflow and base flow and palmer drought severity index pdsi as potential correlates groundwater records were correlated strongly with streamflow records in a study of groundwater trends in northern new england dudley and hodgkins 2013 we also tested correlations with pdsi because it represents soil moisture conditions and could therefore serve as a useful explanatory variable to describe the variability of groundwater levels in shallow aquifers like the glacial aquifer system for variables with correlations between glacial aquifer groundwater levels and meteorological and hydrologic variables across the northern u s we then identified those variables that may be useful for filling in and extending high and low groundwater levels at locations where groundwater records may be relatively short or fragmented longer term meteorological or hydrologic records may serve as useful proxy measures of groundwater estimating missing historical groundwater levels can provide necessary information to place current conditions and contemporary trends into historical context we make a novel application of maintenance of variance linear models to estimate historical annual levels during specifically identified months when annual high or low levels most frequently occur in the u s glacial aquifer system this approach was chosen to constrain the hydrological process associated with a particular high or low level at any given well for example low winter levels associated with frozen precipitation and soils as opposed to low late summer or fall groundwater levels associated with seasonal evapotranspiration 2 data and methods 2 1 groundwater levels study wells in the glacial aquifer system fig 2 were selected from the usgs national water information system nwis u s geological survey 2016 and the national groundwater monitoring network ngwmn u s geological survey center for integrated data analytics 2016 databases the methods used for study well selection and assembly of end of month eom time series of groundwater level data representing the potentiometric surface of the aquifer for each well is described by hodgkins et al 2017a in summary study wells were required to be in or near the bounds of the glacial aquifer system and indicate completion in an aquifer considered glacial in origin all eom groundwater level data were formatted consistently such that high water levels indicated a potentiometric surface nearer to land surface than lower levels highly correlated wells in close proximity to each other 40 km were removed from the analysis to reduce duplication of groundwater level information a minimum data completeness requirement was applied to all candidate wells requiring at least 10 years consecutive or non consecutive of data for any given month for the purposes of interannual correlation testing in general wells in the east region had the most data available and the amount of data decreased from east to west fig 3 2 2 human influence classification this study required the identification of wells in the glacial aquifer system for which groundwater levels may be considered to be minimally influenced by human activity methods used for identifying the relative amounts of potential human influence are described in detail by hodgkins et al 2017a in summary nationally available land cover data homer et al 2015 in proximity to wells and county water use data maupin et al 2014 were used to develop an index of potential human influence comprising four individual metrics and then verified or corrected by local usgs experts hodgkins et al 2017a resulting index scores at each well classified potential human influence into four categories minimal transitional low transitional high and high a subset of 1043 wells of the 2228 candidates were classified as having either minimal or transitional low human influence potential this subset was used for this study fig 2 the final human influence potential category for all candidate study wells along with land use and water use data at and near the wells are provided as supplemental material located in a data release hodgkins et al 2017b 2 3 streamflow the usgs hydroclimatic data network version 2009 hcdn 2009 subset of usgs streamflow gages measure streamflow on rivers considered to be minimally influenced by human disturbance and primarily reflect meteorological conditions lins 2012 hcdn 2009 gages are identified in the geospatial attributes of gages for evaluating streamflow version 2 gages ii dataset falcone 2011 daily streamflow data collected at hcdn 2009 gages were obtained from nwis u s geological survey 2016 through water year 2013 wells were paired with their nearest hcdn 2009 gage on the basis of distance to the nearest river basin boundary for the purpose of correlation testing of groundwater levels with streamflows if they were within 50 km distances between wells and hcdn 2009 drainage basin boundaries were computed using a geographic information system gis 740 of 1043 wells were within 50 km of 98 hcdn 2009 basins median distance 17 8 km daily base flow values for the gages were computed from daily streamflow data using the local minimum method automated in the computer program hysep hydrograph separation sloto and crouse 1996 using hysep ensured that base flow separation was consistently applied to all streamflow records across all time periods monthly mean streamflows and base flows were computed from daily streamflows and base flows respectively for complete months only moving seasonal 3 month semi annual 6 month and annual mean streamflows and base flows were computed from the monthly means regional hydrologic studies of winter spring streamflows predominantly comprised of snowmelt runoff and rain have demonstrated trends toward significantly earlier runoff timing in northern and mountainous sections of the u s glacial aquifer system during the 20th century dudley et al 2017a u s environmental protection agency 2016 hodgkins and dudley 2006 hodgkins et al 2003 the winter spring center volume date wscvd is a measure of snowmelt related streamflow timing the wscvd is the date from the start of the winter spring period by which half or more of the seasonal volume has flowed past a streamflow gaging station for this study wscvd was computed for each year at each gage using methods consistent with previous studies dudley et al 2017a hodgkins and dudley 2006 u s environmental protection agency 2016 for the seasonal period january 1 to june 30 2 4 precipitation and air temperature monthly precipitation and temperature data were obtained from the u s historical climatology network version 2 5 0

record length and completeness monthly data are computed from daily data from the global historical climatology network ghcn menne et al 2012 that have passed quality control checks set forth by durre et al 2010 there were no ushcn stations in alaska monthly precipitation and air temperature data from ghcn stations in anchorage usw00026451 ted stevens international airport and usw00026409 merrill field were used to assemble time series from december 1943 to september 2013 national oceanic and atmospheric administration 2016 study wells were paired with their nearest meteorological station if 75 km apart using gis for the purpose of correlation testing of groundwater levels with precipitation and air temperature 898 of 1043 wells were within 75 km of 176 meteorological stations median distance 34 0 km 612 wells had both a streamflow gage and a meteorological station meeting proximity criteria moving seasonal 3 month semi annual 6 month and annual total precipitation and mean air temperatures were computed using monthly values 2 5 palmer drought severity index and base flow index palmer drought severity index pdsi is a standardized measure of local soil moisture conditions computed using monthly precipitation air temperature and estimated soil moisture capacity palmer 1965 alley 1984 szép et al 2005 monthly pdsi values computed for noaa climate divisions in the conterminous u s national oceanic and atmospheric administration 2015a were obtained from the noaa national centers for environmental information website national oceanic and atmospheric administration 2015b through water year 2013 for the purpose of correlation testing of groundwater levels with pdsi wells were paired with the climate division in which they are located the 1043 candidate wells occupied 84 climate divisions seasonal semi annual and annual averages of pdsi were not computed because pdsi already represents a long term integrated measure of hydrologic conditions base flow index bfi the ratio of annual base flow to total streamflow was spatially interpolated from point estimates of bfi at usgs streamgages for the conterminous u s by wolock 2003a 2 6 correlations all inter annual correlation testing was done using pearson s product moment correlation coefficient r the correlations were considered significant at p 0 05 a minimum of n 10 were required for any correlation test inter annual correlations tested monthly end of month groundwater levels against monthly and moving seasonal 3 month semi annual 6 month and annual means of streamflow base flow and air temperature and totals of precipitation monthly groundwater levels also were tested against same month values of pdsi and previous month groundwater levels lagged by one month groundwater levels for july through december were tested against winter spring streamflow timing which was computed on the basis of streamflow data from january 1 to june 30 2 7 historical groundwater level estimation models linear models relating meteorological and hydrologic variables with groundwater levels were derived using the maintenance of variance extension type 1 move 1 technique hirsch 1982 also referred to as the line of organic correlation helsel and hirsch 2002 the move 1 linear model is derived from the relation between the common time period of two records the model can then be used to produce estimates of the dependent variable on the basis of observations of the independent variable the move 1 technique maintains the variance of the estimates thereby yielding estimates with a statistical distribution similar to that expected had the dependent variable actually been measured helsel and hirsch 2002 the slope of the move 1 line is the ratio of the standard deviations of the two records eq 1 and produces a unique line that is the same regardless of which variable is used as the dependent variable helsel and hirsch 2002 a minimum of n 20 overlapping observations between groundwater levels and an independent variable were required to derive a candidate move 1 model 1 y i y sign r s y s x x i x where y i and x i are the ith measurements of the dependent and independent variables respectively y and x are mean of y and x sign r is the sign of the correlation between y and x and sy and sx are standard deviations of y and x move 1 models were derived for selected month end values representing the most common months of occurrence of high and low groundwater levels at each well only wells with an average data density of six monthly levels per year or more during their periods of record were used in this analysis 497 of 1043 47 7 of wells passed the data density criterion table 1 we did not use the annual maximum and minimum groundwater levels because they can represent different processes for example winter low levels are typically related to extended cold periods with water in snowpack rather than recharging groundwater and summer low levels are typically caused by extended dry periods we defined high groundwater levels for qualifying study wells as the highest 25th percentile groundwater levels for the entire period of record computed on the basis of detrended groundwater levels using a loess moving average curve with a smoothing window span of 0 3 among those levels we then identified the most frequent month associated with these high groundwater levels figs 4 and 5 the same procedure was used to define low groundwater levels on the basis of the lowest 25th percentile levels figs 4 and 5 candidate independent variables included monthly and moving seasonal 3 month semi annual and annual means of streamflow base flow air temperature and precipitation totals and monthly pdsi values the data release by hodgkins et al 2017b tabulates the nearest usgs hcdn 2009 streamflow gage streamflow and baseflow nearest hcn meteorological station air temperature and precipitation and noaa climate division pdsi used for each well the derived move 1 models were required to pass several diagnostic tests in order to be considered successful the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse statistic eq 2 was used as a measure of move 1 model performance it is a normalized statistic that provides a measure of how well model output matches measured data nash and sutcliffe 1970 moriasi et al 2007 2 nse 1 1 n i 1 n q obs i q move i 2 1 n i 1 n q obs i q obs i 2 where q obs i is the ith measurement of the groundwater level q move i is the ith model estimated level q o b s i is the mean of the measured levels and n is the total number of measured levels nse ranges in value from negative infinity through 1 0 a value of 0 0 or less indicates that the mean of the measured values is a better predictor than the model estimated values values between 0 0 and 1 0 are viewed as acceptable with 1 0 indicating a perfect match between every measured and model estimated value moriasi et al 2007 move 1 models for this study were required to have nse 0 50 to be considered a successful model additional diagnostic screening required that model residuals were not significantly p 0 05 autocorrelated lag 1 or significantly p 0 05 correlated with time groundwater level or independent variable addressing heteroscedasticity if a well had more than one move 1 model passing the above diagnostic screening the best model was chosen on the basis of the highest nse value 3 results and discussion results are subset into four regions within the glacial aquifer system defined by warner and arnold 2006 that share similar physiography east central west central and west fig 1 these regions have been delineated on the basis of similar environmental and hydrogeologic features that affect the rate of groundwater input and flow including topography precipitation sediment thickness and composition hydraulic properties and direction of glacial advance during the last glacial period warner and ayotte 2014 3 1 correlations many relations between groundwater levels and hydrologic and meteorological variables in the glacial aquifer system varied along an east west gradient the percentage of significant correlations of groundwater levels with the level of the preceding month table 2 lvl 1 was lowest in the east region increased in the central region and increased for most months again in the west central region wells in the central and west central regions exhibited greater persistence less month to month variability in their groundwater levels the percentage of wells with significant correlations between groundwater levels and pdsi decreased from the east to west central regions 3 1 1 east a large majority of the 204 qualifying study wells in the east region were among the shallowest wells in the glacial aquifer system with a median depth of 8 3 m 27 2 ft 93 of the wells were less than 30 5 m 100 ft deep fig 6 a in general the glacial deposits in the east region are predominantly coarse grained warner and ayotte 2014 this can promote relatively rapid rates of groundwater flow when combined with relatively high topographic relief fig 6b and the most humid climate of all the regions fig 6c warner and ayotte 2014 these characteristics result in groundwater levels that exhibited greater month to month variability and significant correlations most often with shorter 1 and 3 month measures of hydrologic and meteorological variables table 2a than groundwater levels observed in the other regions of the glacial aquifer system for example the highest percentage of significant correlations between groundwater levels and streamflow in the east were with 1 to 3 month average streamflows whereas the highest percentage of correlations in the central and west central regions were generally with 3 to 12 month average streamflows table 2a high groundwater levels defined in data and methods historical groundwater level estimation models section most commonly occurred during march april at wells in the east region figs 4 and 5 as a result of recharge provided by precipitation and melt of accumulated winter snowpack occurrence of high groundwater levels in other months of the year except may was rare high groundwater levels were significantly correlated with streamflow and base flow at 52 68 of wells most frequently with the same month 1 month means table 2a indicating a strong connection between the generally shallow aquifers in this region and surface water pdsi was significantly correlated with groundwater levels at a majority of wells in general high groundwater levels correlated with air temperature at few wells groundwater levels in the east region exhibited high month to month persistence during august and september when levels were most commonly at their lowest table 2 fig 4 during these months groundwater discharge from the relatively shallow glacial deposits in the east can contribute substantially to streamflow a relation reflected in the high percentage of significant correlations between low groundwater levels and same month or seasonal 3 month streamflow and base flow table 2a average correlation coefficients were generally between 0 6 and 0 7 table 2b dudley and hodgkins 2013 also observed that late summer groundwater levels in northern new england correlated strongly with contemporaneous streamflow and base flow in the current study low groundwater levels during august and september were significantly correlated with pdsi and 6 to 12 month antecedent precipitation at two thirds or more of wells table 2a low groundwater levels were significantly related to air temperature at a very small percentage of wells indicating that air temperature does not play a major role in warm season low groundwater levels although substantial recharge occurs during spring with the melt of accumulated winter snowpack few wells in the region indicated correlation between summer and fall groundwater levels and winter spring snowmelt related runoff timing wscvd 3 1 2 central the 81 study wells in the central region were generally deeper than those in the east region with a median depth of 17 4 m 57 1 ft 80 5 of the wells were less than 30 5 m 100 ft deep fig 6a glacial deposits in the central region are generally composed of thick sequences of coarse and fine grained glacial sediments and are overall thicker than those in the east with some locations such as northern indiana having extensive glacial sediments hundreds of feet thick warner and ayotte 2014 and michigan with deposits up to 305 m 1000 ft thick in some areas warner and arnold 2006 topographic relief throughout the central region is representative of a transition between the high relief of the east region and the plains in the west central region fig 6b the climate in the central region is considered humid although drier than the east region fig 6c warner and ayotte 2014 these characteristics result in groundwater levels that generally exhibit less month to month variability than levels in the east region groundwater levels in the central region generally correlated most strongly with long term 6 and 12 month measures of hydrologic and meteorological variables table 2a high groundwater levels most commonly occurred during april at wells in the central region fig 4 although some of the most northern wells exhibited high groundwater levels most commonly in later spring or early summer months fig 5 the highest percentage of significant correlations between april groundwater levels and other variables were with 6 month mean streamflow and base flow table 2a correlation with streamflow explained on average nearly half of the variability r 2 0 498 mean correlation coefficient 0 706 in april levels table 2b april levels by contrast correlated with 3 month air temperature at only 10 of wells table 2a low groundwater levels in the central region most commonly occurred during two times of the year winter centered on february and late summer centered on september fig 4 wells for which low groundwater levels most frequently occurred in january april were all located in northern wisconsin and michigan figs 1 and 5 low levels during july october predominantly occurred in the southern part of the central region fig 5 february groundwater levels in the central region correlated at most wells with seasonal 3 month streamflow and annual mean 12 month base flow this contrasts with the high percentage of significant correlations with 1 month streamflows and base flows in the east table 2a september low groundwater levels correlated most often with annual mean streamflow and seasonal base flow about half 46 and 50 of the variability in february and september groundwater levels was explained on average by streamflow table 2b low groundwater levels correlated with air temperature at few wells for both february and september similar to the east region few wells in the region had significant correlations between warm season groundwater levels and winter spring snowmelt related streamflow timing 3 1 3 west central the 731 study wells in the west central region were generally deeper than those in the east and central regions with a median depth of 24 4 m 80 1 ft about a quarter of the wells 24 7 were equal to or greater than 45 7 m 150 ft deep fig 6a similar to the central region glacial deposits in the west central region are generally composed of thick sequences of coarse and fine grained glacial sediments that include carbonate material warner and ayotte 2014 topography of the west central region is predominantly flat with some local topographic relief provided by moraines and drumlins formed by glacial processes fig 6b warner and ayotte 2014 mean annual precipitation in the west central region is much lower than the east and central regions fig 6c with a semiarid climate in the plains of nebraska north and south dakota and montana fig 1 warner and ayotte 2014 widely distributed unsorted fine grained surficial sediments in this region are characterized by lower permeability of surficial sediments than the other regions fig 7 warner and ayotte 2014 attributed longer groundwater residence time in the west central region compared to the east and central regions to greater depths to the water table drier climatic conditions and lower rates of groundwater recharge in general monthly groundwater levels in the west central region correlated most strongly with long term 6 and 12 month measures of hydrologic and meteorological variables high groundwater levels most commonly occurred during april may at wells in the west central region fig 4 aside from the preceding month groundwater level the highest percentage of significant correlations between april and may groundwater levels and other variables was with annual mean streamflows and base flows table 2a correlation with these variables explained on average 45 49 of the variability in groundwater levels table 2b low groundwater levels in the west central region most commonly occurred during july august although low levels occurred at many wells during winter and early spring january march fig 4 unlike the central region wells for which low levels most frequently occurred in january march were not limited to the northernmost part of the region but rather located throughout the west central region well depth was a distinguishing factor between wells with low levels during winter and those during summer on the basis of a wilcoxon rank sum test p 0 0001 wells with january march low levels were shallower median well depth 12 2 m than the wells with july september low levels median depth 28 6 m july and august groundwater levels had significant correlations with annual averages of streamflow and base flow at about half of wells table 2a groundwater levels generally were correlated with precipitation and pdsi at many fewer wells groundwater levels correlated with air temperature at less than 15 of wells among all months like other regions few wells in the west central region had significant correlations between july and august groundwater levels and winter spring streamflow timing 3 1 4 west few wells n 27 fig 3 in the west region met record length and completeness and human influence potential criteria the 27 study wells in the west region were generally the deepest in the glacial aquifer system with a median depth of 50 9 m 167 ft fig 6a topography in the west region is hilly and mountainous although the mean land surface slope in the vicinity of the study wells in this region is generally low as most glacial material was deposited in the valleys of the mountainous terrain fig 6b warner and ayotte 2014 the climate is arid in the vicinity of most of the study wells in the west region except for the wells in washington and alaska fig 1 fig 6c glacial surficial sediments in the vicinity of these wells reflected a wide range of permeability fig 7 the small number of wells that passed the data length and completeness criteria precluded most monthly correlation tests table 2 only 4 wells 1 in western montana 2 in northern idaho and 1 near anchorage alaska fig 5 met the data density criterion precluding plots of frequency of occurrence of high and low groundwater levels fig 4 the number of qualifying wells is too small for robust results on the amount of groundwater level variability explained by hydrologic and meteorological variables 3 2 estimation of historical groundwater levels using proxy records strong correlations between groundwater levels and hydrologic and meteorological variables suggest that statistical models may be useful for estimating historical groundwater levels zhuoheng et al 2002 demonstrated successful application of statistical models to estimate mean annual groundwater levels in the upper carbonate aquifer in southern manitoba canada using explanatory variables of precipitation and air temperature our study derived move 1 models to estimate month end groundwater level values for months when high and low groundwater levels most commonly occurred at each qualifying well some 67 wells 37 4 of all study wells qualifying for both data density and minimum data criteria yielded 91 successful models for either high or low groundwater level models table 1 24 wells had both a successful high and low groundwater level model derived the greatest rate of derivation of successful models was for wells in the central region 55 2 of all qualifying wells and the least in the west central region 25 6 only 4 wells in the west region met the data density criterion and none met the minimum data criterion 3 2 1 high groundwater levels successful high groundwater level models table 3 example shown in fig 8 had an overall mean nash sutcliffe efficiency statistic nse of 0 66 with a mean nse of 0 67 among wells in the east and mean nse scores of 0 64 at wells in the central and west central regions streamflow and base flow were the most common explanatory variables across all regions table 3 remaining models used precipitation or pdsi a majority of high groundwater level models in the east region used streamflow or base flow as the explanatory variable which generally yielded the strongest models overall on the basis of a mean nse of 0 68 for streamflow and 0 77 for base flow among those the majority of models used same month 1 month streamflow or base flow as the best explanatory variable second to streamflow and base flow precipitation was the explanatory variable for 6 of 28 models yielding models with a mean nse of 0 61 3 of the 6 models used same month 1 month precipitation as the best explanatory variable these 6 wells in the east region were the only high groundwater level models that used precipitation as an explanatory variable among all the regions pdsi was used in 3 of the 28 models and with a mean nse of 0 65 more than three quarters of high groundwater level models in the central region used streamflow or base flow as the explanatory variable mean nse of 0 67 for streamflow 0 61 for base flow a majority of models used annual mean streamflow or base flow as the best explanatory variable the remaining models in the central region used pdsi and yielded the lowest mean nse 0 56 for the region the semi arid climate and aquifer characteristics such as greater depth to water thicker unsaturated zone in the west central region precluded derivation of many successful models base flow and streamflow were the most common explanatory variables in the west central region mean nse 0 63 and a single model used pdsi 3 2 2 low groundwater levels successful low groundwater level models table 4 example shown in fig 9 had an overall mean nse of 0 66 with mean nses of 0 67 0 65 and 0 63 in the east central and west central regions respectively successful low groundwater level model derivation rate for wells in the west central region was greater 30 0 than the success rate for derivation of high groundwater level models in that region 14 3 streamflow and base flow were the most common explanatory variables across all regions table 4 remaining models used precipitation or pdsi half of the low groundwater level models for wells in the east region used streamflow or base flow as the explanatory variable mean nse 0 67 and nearly all of the remaining models used 3 to 12 month totals of precipitation mean nse 0 64 the best nse scores were associated with wells where same month streamflow annual total precipitation or pdsi mean nse 0 78 served as the best explanatory variables most of the low groundwater level models for wells in the central region used streamflow or base flow as the explanatory variable mean nse 0 68 and yielded models with the highest nse scores in the region the remaining models used 3 month total of precipitation nse 0 53 or pdsi mean nse 0 59 as explanatory variables two thirds of successful low groundwater level models in the west central region used streamflow or base flow as the explanatory variable which yielded a mean nse of 0 65 models using 1 and 3 month mean streamflow had the highest nse scores in the region the remaining 3 models used pdsi mean nse 0 58 or annual total precipitation nse 0 63 as the explanatory variable 3 2 3 characteristics of successful models characteristics common to wells with successful models for high or low groundwater levels as opposed to wells without successful models wilcoxon rank sum test with p 0 0001 included relatively higher precipitation relatively higher local land surface slope relatively lower amounts of clay composing surficial sediments and relatively higher base flow index the ratio of annual base flow to total streamflow fig 10 well depth was not a distinguishing characteristic successful low groundwater level models shared the clay fraction and bfi characteristics mentioned above while successful high groundwater level models shared all four high land surface slope and permeability of surficial sediments low clay content contribute to relatively high responsiveness of groundwater levels to precipitation and to hydraulic connectivity with surface waters the statistical modeling approach described in this article for estimating historical high and low groundwater levels using proxy records is likely applicable in other surficial aquifer systems with similar climatic and geologic characteristics 4 summary and conclusions we document regional correlations between monthly groundwater levels from 1043 wells throughout the glacial aquifer system in the u s with selected hydrologic and meteorological variables and identify candidate variables that may be useful for estimating high and low groundwater levels to augment short or fragmentary records study wells were carefully evaluated for human influence potential on the basis of water use and land use data and input from local usgs groundwater specialists only wells with minimal or low human influence potential were selected for study streamflow data were likewise screened for minimal human influence and meteorological data were selected for their quality and use in long term climatological studies consequently the documented relations reflect environmental conditions relatively free from human land and water use impacts variability in groundwater levels across the glacial aquifer system is controlled by precipitation evapotranspiration surficial soil and aquifer properties and topographic relief in the vicinity of the wells relations between groundwater levels and hydrologic and meteorological variables in the glacial aquifer system varied along an east west gradient correlations of groundwater levels with the level of the preceding month indicate general east to west increase in persistence in groundwater time series in the east region high topographic relief a humid climate and mostly shallow coarse grained aquifer materials contribute to relatively high responsiveness of groundwater levels to precipitation and groundwater levels with greater month to month variability than other regions of the glacial aquifer system groundwater levels in the east region correlated most strongly with short term 1 and 3 month averages of hydrologic and meteorological variables in the central and west central regions of the glacial aquifer system flatter topography less permeable surficial geology and greater aquifer thickness yielded stronger correlations with hydrologic and meteorological variables averaged over longer time intervals especially for wells in more arid parts of the glacial aquifer system plains of nebraska north and south dakota and montana li et al 2015 similarly observed greater lag between regional mean groundwater storage and monthly precipitation in arid regions high groundwater levels most commonly occurred during spring months of march may across the glacial aquifer system as a result of recharge provided by precipitation and melting of accumulated winter snowpack high groundwater levels significantly correlated with streamflow and base flow at a majority of wells for all regions there were generally few significant correlations between high groundwater levels and air temperature in all regions there was greater variability in the months of the annual low groundwater levels than months of high levels low levels most commonly occurred during summer early fall months of july september across the glacial aquifer system as a result of evapotranspiration winter early spring january march low groundwater levels were relatively common among wells in the central and west central regions particularly in northern wisconsin and michigan where precipitation in the winter is generally stored as snow notably there were few correlations with summer early fall low groundwater levels and timing of snowmelt runoff across all regions low groundwater levels during august and september were significantly correlated with streamflow base flow precipitation or pdsi at more than two thirds of the wells in the east region for the central region september groundwater levels correlated with streamflow and base flow at about two thirds of wells the strongest correlations in the west central region between july and august groundwater levels and other variables were with streamflow and base flow for about half the wells in the region as was the case with high groundwater levels there were generally few correlations between low levels and air temperature in all regions indicating that the impact of evapotranspiration on groundwater levels is not greatly affected by the inter annual variability of temperatures or the effect is masked by other variables we investigated the use of maintenance of variance linear models to leverage the strong correlations between groundwater levels and hydrologic and meteorological variables as a means to fill in or extend year to year historical groundwater levels for selected months during which high and low levels most commonly occurred development of month specific models constrained the hydrological processes associated with a particular high or low level at any given well overall 37 4 of all study wells qualifying for both data density and minimum data criteria had one or more successful models derived for high and or low groundwater levels wells in the central region had the highest rate of successful model development 55 2 wells with successful models of either type high or low across the glacial aquifer system shared characteristics of relatively higher local precipitation higher local land surface slope lower amounts of clay within the surficial sediments and higher base flow index streamflow and base flow served as strong explanatory variables among successful models for both high and low groundwater level models these variables were in about two thirds of all models across all three regions between the two variables streamflow appeared most frequently in nearly half of all models streamflow was most frequent in models in the east and central regions but base flow was most frequent in models in the west central region the frequent appearance of streamflow and base flow as explanatory variables indicates streamflow data provide important information for estimating missing high and low groundwater levels short term measures of streamflow 1 to 3 month were most frequent for models in the east region while 6 to 12 month measures of streamflow were most frequent for models in the central and west central regions precipitation appeared in 20 of models most of which were in the east region and more frequently as an explanatory variable in low groundwater level models palmer drought severity index pdsi served as an explanatory variable in 13 of models in both high and low groundwater level models and appeared in models for all regions most frequently in the east region using statistical models to estimate long term historical groundwater levels can provide important historical context for interpreting shorter term trends and extreme events and can lengthen available historical datasets to support numerical analyses such as groundwater modeling e g mack 2009 or developing short term forecasting models dudley et al 2017b groundwater level models using proxy records also can provide insight into how climate change might impact groundwater resources if anticipated climate related

7241,low lying coastal regions are often highly populated constitute sensitive habitats and are at the same time exposed to challenging hydrological environments due to surface flooding from storm events and saltwater intrusion which both may affect drinking water supply from shallow and deeper aquifers near the wadden sea at the border of southern denmark and northern germany the hydraulic system connecting groundwater river water and the sea was altered over centuries until the 19th century by e g the construction of dikes and drains to prevent flooding and allow agricultural use today massive saltwater intrusions extend up to 20 km inland in order to understand the regional flow a methodological approach was developed that combined 1 a highly resolved voxel geological model 2 a 1 million node groundwater model with 46 hydrofacies coupled to rivers drains and the sea 3 tikhonov regularization calibration using hydraulic heads and average stream discharges as targets and 4 parameter uncertainty analysis it is relatively new to use voxel models for constructing geological models that often have been simplified to stacked pseudo 3d layer geology the study is therefore one of the first to combine a voxel geological model with state of the art flow calibration techniques the results show that voxel geological modelling where lithofacies information are transferred to each volumetric element is a useful method to preserve 3d geological heterogeneity on a local scale which is important when distinct geological features such as buried valleys are abundant furthermore it is demonstrated that simpler geological models and simpler calibration methods do not perform as well the proposed approach is applicable to many other systems because it combines advanced and flexible geological modelling and flow calibration techniques this has led to new insights in the regional flow patterns and especially about water cycling in the marsh area near the coast based on the ability to define six predictive scenarios from the linear analysis of parameter uncertainty the results show that the coastal system near the danish german border is mainly controlled by flow in the two aquifers separated by a thick clay layer and several deep high permeable buried valleys that connect the sea with the interior and the two aquifers the drained marsh area acts like a huge regional sink limiting submarine groundwater discharge with respect to water balance the greatest sensitivity to parameter uncertainty was observed in the drained marsh area where some scenarios showed increased flow of sea water into the interior and increased drainage we speculate that the massive salt water intrusion may be caused by a combination of the preferential pathways provided by the buried valleys the marsh drainage and relatively high hydraulic conductivities in the two main aquifers as described by one of the scenarios this is currently under investigation by using a salt water transport model keywords voxel geology regional groundwater flow model modflow highly heterogeneous coastal aquifer system regularized inversion pest linear uncertainty analysis 1 introduction three dimensional regional scale groundwater models have become increasingly important in supporting water management refsgaard et al 2010 combined with different types of available data and conceptual knowledge of aquifer systems they enable estimation of hydrogeological key parameters by calibration aiming at a better understanding of the physiography winter 1999 affected by human alterations and making predictions e g on future water availability henriksen et al 2003 reilly et al 2008 coastal aquifers are particular challenging because they represent a physiography with an often complex geology and a variable landscape with low lying areas marshes near the coast stresses induced by historic water level changes in response to climate changes and human activities such as dike construction groundwater abstraction for water supply or irrigation and drainage may greatly affect the flow patterns salt water intrusion and water budgets of coastal aquifers e g delsman et al 2014 pauw et al 2012 the geological model forms the basis for a groundwater model that can be coupled to surface water systems such as rivers and the ocean geological voxel models are relatively new ways of constructing geological models and have recently been successfully applied jørgensen et al 2015 jørgensen and sandersen 2006 here the interpretation of geology is done directly onto a 3d grid and each grid cell contains lithological information independently from any layer structure has the flexibility to describe distinct geological features for example heterogeneities such as buried valleys kehew et al 2012 piotrowski 1994 can be of major significance for flow and transport by providing preferential flow paths for seawater mulligan et al 2007 but voxel models like other type of models rely on good geological data shortcomings of point measurements e g geological well logs in capturing spatial heterogeneity can be overcome if combined with areal geophysical data methods such as airborne electromagnetic aem surveys cover large areas in short time and provide useful information about electrical properties related to clay minerals and solute content in pore water however the link between geology and electrical properties is not unique additionally the resolution of the aem data decreases with penetration depth for more discussion see jørgensen et al 2013 recent studies by christensen et al 2017 marker et al 2015 and foged et al 2014 aim to automate the workflow from interpreting airborne geophysical data applying clay fraction modelling and integrating hydrological data to readily calibrated groundwater models while this approach provides an objective way in all steps it is challenged by ambiguity and therefore lacks the incorporation of geological expert knowledge that would be provided using cognitive modelling jørgensen et al 2013 therefore suggest to combine automated and cognitive geological modelling a complex description of the hydro geological architecture increases the requirements for systematic and robust parameter estimation during model calibration parameters like hydraulic conductivity porosity and boundary conditions are adjusted such that model outputs match historical measurements hill and tiedeman 2007 using only a few adjustable parameters ensures that the inverse problem is well posed hill 1998 when models are complex and the number of parameters high calibration can be difficult doherty and hunt 2010 as there is often more than one combination of parameters that yield equally satisfying simulations beven 2006 hill and tiedeman 2007 the problem of identifiability comes from the fact that the information content in the available data is too low because of few data or sometimes because the parameters are correlated or measurement noise is high carrera et al 2010 hill and tiedeman 2007 nevertheless tools to approach ill posed highly parameterized problems have become available during the last decade doherty 2003 2015 using regularized inversion it is possible to estimate a substantially higher number of parameters than in traditional calibration doherty 2003 regularization is applied to convert an ill posed problem into a well posed problem that can be solved one approach is to include knowledge on the system characteristics through tikhonov regularization doherty 2003 tikhonov and arsenin 1977 here preferred conditions on the parameters are specified to improve parameter uniqueness and stability of the estimation process different conditions can be applied doherty et al 2010 including preferred values based on e g pump test results or preferred differences based on e g knowledge of the depositional environment of the aquifer that can delineate relatively homogeneous formations another approach is singular value decomposition svd where combinations of parameters that are insensitive or highly correlated are identified and excluded from calibration the remaining parameter combinations are members of the solution space and are subject to calibration the two approaches can be combined hunt et al 2007 which increases the chance of solving a highly parameterized problem the use of regularized inversion complies well with the development of complex geological models where a large number of parameters have to be estimated linear doherty and hunt 2009 and non linear analysis techniques are available for exploring parameter and prediction uncertainty of regularized inversions and have been utilized in recent studies james et al 2009 keating et al 2010 knowling et al 2015 applied regularized inversion to a highly parameterized regional scale groundwater flow model and linear parameter uncertainty analysis to differentiate between climate and pumping impact on aquifer depletion they used a three layer geology and accounted for heterogeneity by using pilot points doherty 2003 in the two aquifer layers the number of studies combining a detailed geological model e g a voxel description with highly parameterized calibration is however limited this is exactly the methodological approach we want to develop investigate and apply to a danish regional aquifer system the objectives of the current study are to present a systematic approach for regional scale groundwater modelling where i a sophisticated geological voxel model jørgensen et al 2015 that describes the geological heterogeneity at local scale is converted into a hydrogeological model preserving as much geological information as possible on grid cell scale resulting in a 1 2 million node model ii model parameters are estimated using regularized inversion where as much expert knowledge as available is incorporated iii the parameter uncertainty is evaluated based on linear analysis and iv the impact of parameter uncertainty on water balance predictions is investigated the multi aquifer system at the wadden sea at the danish german border is used as a test case the overall aim is to understand groundwater flow and the interaction with surface water systems such as rivers drainage channels and the ocean in a complex hydrogeological setting investigations by jørgensen et al 2012 indicated that saltwater intrusions can be observed up to 20 km inland and they highlight the need for a highly resolved geological model and groundwater flow model in order to answer questions concerning 1 the regional flow and the impact of the distinct geological elements such as tunnel valley and faults and 2 anthropogenic influence such as heavy drainage system 3 the role of miocene aquifers in the regional flow system on and 4 the evolution and origin of the saltwater intrusion in this study salt water intrusion is not addressed 2 study area the transboundary model area fig 1 red line covers 1300 km2 and is partly located in southern denmark partly in northern germany at the wadden sea it is characterized by a low lying coastal area in the west with elevations below mean sea level m s l these marsh areas were reclaimed from the wadden sea during the last centuries by the construction of dikes and drains to make the land arable in the east the study area extends to the water divide of the jutland ridge formed during the late glacial maximum in the last weichselian glaciation with elevations of up to about 85 m above sea level m a s l the groundwater flow generally follows the present day topography from the ridge in the east to the low lands in the west fig 3 in order to enable agricultural use of the low lying area a dense network of drains and ditches keep the water level constantly below the ground surface large areas therefore have a groundwater table lower than mean sea level the maritime climate has a dominant wind direction from the north west transporting precipitation inland from the north sea orographic effects result in precipitation increasing from 900 mm year in the west to about 1100 mm year in the central area and the jutland ridge representing the period 1991 2010 rasmussen et al 2012 2 1 geology the area fig 1 blue line is located south of the ringkøbing fyn high at the northern margin of the north german basin the transition from the ringkøbing fyn high to the north german basin is defined by the rømø fault zone in which the tønder graben fault structure has evolved fig 1 fig 2 the outline of the tønder graben is expressed in the top chalk surface as elongated depressions trending nw se the fault offsets the deeper part of the sediment succession in the order of hundreds of meters ter borch 1991 low permeable paleogene clays fig 2 deposited in a deep marine environment are overlaid by miocene deposits which consist of marine clay silt and sand mainly deposited in deltaic environments rasmussen et al 2010 scharling et al 2009 the miocene deposits gently dip towards sw and are generally more sandy in the northeast than in the southwest fig 2 in the western part of the study area thick marine clays the måde group of the upper miocene occur fig 2 the miocene quaternary boundary is a widespread unconformity the måde formation is separating the shallower pleistocene units from the deeper miocene sands buried valleys are common in the entire study area jørgensen and sandersen 2006 the predominant quaternary deposits consist of clayey glacial till and meltwater sand the weichselian ice sheet only covered the easternmost part of the study area where it left behind a young morainic landscape fig 2 in the west the geology mainly consists of large meltwater plains surrounding gently undulating morainic plains left by the saalian glaciation smed 1981 glaciotectonic deformation is common in the area and old buried glaciotectonic complexes are found in many places both within the area jørgensen et al 2012 and nearby andersen 2004 høyer et al 2013 2 2 geological and hydrological data hydrological and borehole data fig 3 within the study area were available from different sources water levels from more than 1000 wells were extracted from jupiter the danish national database for geological and hydrological data geus www geus dk distributed net recharge was derived from the national water resources model of denmark henriksen et al 2003 and stream discharge measurements at three locations for the years 2000 2010 were available fig 2 a total of approx 170 km high resolution seismic lines were available within the study area fig 1 airborne transient electro magnetic aem data collected with the skytem system sørensen and auken 2004 and acquired with different setups in the period 2004 2013 were available for an area of 1500 km2 most of the surveys penetrate to around 150 200 m depth the aem data was inverted and gridded into a 3d resistivity grid with the dimensions 100mx100m laterally and 5 m vertically 3 material methods 3 1 geological model the final geological model was constructed as a voxel model combining a range of geophysical and geological data and innovative modelling techniques such as clay fraction cf multi point simulation mps and cognitive layer and voxel modelling as described in høyer et al 2017 and jørgensen et al 2015 a brief summary is provided here the area was discretized into grids with dimensions of 100 m 100 m laterally and 5 m vertically resulting in a total of 70 8 million voxels the model was constructed using the software geoscene3d i gis 2016 since the model area is relatively large and the geology in many places very complex the model was not entirely constructed by using manual modelling approaches automated modelling procedures were therefore applied in some areas the overall modelling approach is described in table 1 in combination with fig 2 within a part of the area the results from an already existing geological model jørgensen et al 2015 were reused the surfaces top pre quaternary bottom måde and top paleogene were modelled manually and used as boundaries in the subsequent automated modelling the paleogene and the måde group were defined as homogeneous formations since these deposits have only limited heterogeneity whereas the miocene and the quaternary were modelled using different voxel modelling methods the miocene succession was modelled using multiple point simulation mps guardiano and srivastava 1993 strebelle 2002 with the stanford geostatistical modelling software sgems remy et al 2009 this part of the geological model is described in detail in høyer et al 2017 a manually constructed 3d training image was designed on the basis of well known structures in the miocene rasmussen et al 2010 the geological interpretations of the seismic data kristensen et al 2015 were used as hard data despite the fact that depths in the seismic sections are known to be uncertain due to uncertainties related to stacking velocities hard conditioning was nevertheless utilized since the level of uncertainty of seismic data is assumed to be much lower than the uncertainty of the other available data especially since the scale of the structures delineated by the seismics is comparable to the scale of the simulated output the borehole information was gridded to a 3d grid and used as soft conditioning information since many of the boreholes are of low quality and the borehole information is discretized in another resolution 1 m compared to the simulation grid 5 m høyer et al 2017 the quaternary succession is in general extremely complex and an automated modelling routine was developed specifically for modelling this succession this routine combines borehole and aem data and a highly heterogeneous geological model was obtained the quaternary was modelled based on borehole gridding and translation of the resistivity grid into lithologies the detailed borehole descriptions were categorized into five lithologies sand gravel silt clay and clayey till and the voxel grid was locally populated with the lithologies encountered in the boreholes in areas with aem data the resistivity grid was translated into lithology based on typical resistivity values in areas without aem or borehole data coarser borehole gridding and manual interpretation were applied a representation of the final geological model consisting of 46 different units is shown in figs 2 and 4 the pre quaternary bluish colors is characterized by interchanging layers of miocene sand and clay that dip toward west the miocene sequence is intersected by several buried valley systems that at some locations cut through the entire formation fig 4 the tønder graben is also clearly seen in the central part of the area where a depression in the miocene layers is observed the heterogeneity of the quaternary is generally extensive both in the buried valleys and in the more surficial layers that are affected by glaciotectonic disturbances locally 3 2 numerical flow model numerical modelling of groundwater flow was performed with modflow 2000 harbaugh et al 2000 first a coast to coast modflow model covering approximately 2800 km2 fig 1 blue line was set up to simulate the regional groundwater flow in order to minimize the computation time the model area was reduced to 1300 km2 fig 1 red line bordering the west coast and delineated along water divides derived from the coast to coast model the model domain was divided into 237 rows and 313 columns with a horizontal discretization of 200 m in the west near the coast and 400 m in the east the western boundary was defined by the 37 5 km long coast line while the eastern boundary was defined by the water divide at the jutland ridge the grid extended to depths of about 450 m and was divided into 61 layers above an elevation of 10 m a s l the layers followed the topography of the area and have variable thicknesses between depths of 10 m and 150 m a s l the vertical discretization was 5 m and below 150 m a s l it was 10 m the top of the paleogene clay defined the model bottom the highly discretized heterogeneous geological model see section 3 1 served as a base for the regional scale steady state flow model the 3d regional flow field was simulated in steady state the geological voxel model was interpolated to the modflow grid using inverse distance with a constant nodal function and one nearest point to calculate the interpolation weight this way averaging was avoided and each grid cell contained geological information from only one geological unit the resulting 46 hydrogeological units are presented in table 2 showing the geological zones and their proportion in the numerical model homogeneity and anisotropy were assumed within each of the 46 hydrogeological units no flow boundaries were defined to the east north and south as well as at the bottom of the model fig 5 in the constant density modflow model the coastline in the west was represented by a constant head boundary with saline boundary heads corrected for freshwater heads taking density effects into account guo and langevin 2002 morgan et al 2012 post et al 2007 internal boundaries were implemented as recharge abstraction wells rivers and drains see fig 5 the net recharge data for the danish part of the area originated from the national water resources model of denmark henriksen et al 2003 the recharge for the german part was estimated based on the relation between topography and recharge at a cross section close to the border on the danish side the distributed net recharge was averaged over the years 1991 2010 and assigned directly to the groundwater table as a prescribed flux the average recharge was 456 mm year with a spatial standard deviation of 81 mm year abstraction data from 1827 danish wells extracted from jupiter and 14 german abstraction wells were included in the model with a total abstraction of 26 106 m3 year the abstraction rates were based on the average from 2000 to 2011 on the danish side and from 2009 on the german side the main rivers were described using the river package riverbed bottom elevations were assigned to 2 m below the surface from a digital elevation model dem with a resolution of 1 6 m 1 6 m the river depth was assigned as 0 2 m in the upstream areas and 0 5 m in the downstream areas the marsh areas in the west were highly drained to elevations below sea level see fig 5 to take smaller streams and ditches in the rest of the model area into account drains were defined in all other cells of the first active layer at an elevation of 1 m below ground surface based on the dem 1 6 m 1 6 m the drain return package banta 2000 was used to accumulate the total inflow within the catchment to a discharge station in order to use stream discharge observations during calibration drain and river conductances were estimated during the calibration 3 3 calibration and uncertainty analysis the flow model was calibrated using the parameter estimation tool pest doherty 2015 calibration complexity was added successively to the model by increasing the number of parameters while the inverse problem was successively more constrained by adding regularization as well as observation types used as optimization targets doherty 2015 p 54 sanford 2011 found that including flux information into the calibration mitigate the problem of non uniqueness that occurs when only potential observations are included following this not only head measurements but also direct measurements of stream discharge were included 3 3 1 calibration approach five different calibration experiments were performed to investigate 1 the influence of regularization manual and mathematical and 2 the influence of observational data types on the calibration results table 3 shows the set up with the experiment name the observation groups the number of parameters and the applied regularization method based on the geological model with 46 hydrogeological units two alternative parameterizations were defined the first approach called zone followed the principle of parsimony hill 2006 keeping the model as simple as possible but still as complex as necessary here the 46 geological units were reclassified to seven hydrofacies whose hydraulic conductivities were estimated in the other parameterization approach one hydraulic conductivity for each of the 46 units was calibrated in order to explore the impact of complexity in geology on calibration results riverbed and drain conductances as well as two vertical anisotropy factors the ratio of horizontal to vertical hydraulic conductivity kh kv for sand and clay were also estimated in the calibration process all parameters were log transformed during calibration 3 3 2 reclassification and sensitivity analysis for calibration experiment zone in order to regroup the 46 geological units to seven hydrofacies their sedimentation environments as well as their clay content were taken into account the geological description and group classification are shown in table 2 the seven hydrofacies include miocene clay deposited in a marine environment with high silt and clay content mc1 mc5 miocene clay deposited in a deep marine shelf environment namely the måde formation mc6 mc7 which is expected to have a very low permeability the third hydrofacies include miocene sands ms1 ms4 deposited in deltaic and lacustrine environments and having a low clay content hence a moderate permeability the pleistocene units were classified into four units including sand and clay with a low or high permeability respectively a formal local parameter sensitivity analysis of the horizontal hydraulic conductivities of the 46 units was carried out to identify the most sensitive parameters from each group shown in fig 6 the composite sensitivity si for the ith estimated parameter and n observations is calculated as 1 s i 1 n j n ω jj x ji 2 1 2 with ωjj the observation weight xji the derivative of simulated head value j to parameter i and n the number of observations a high sensitivity was found for units with a high frequency mc6 ms1 qs1 in the other groups this relation was not observed which could be due to the distribution of observation data finally calibration was carried out with the other group parameters tied to the most sensitive one in the group 3 3 3 regularized inversion in non unique calibration situations where more than one parameter set satisfy the calibration target equally well regularization can constrain and stabilize the calibration in order to reach uniqueness of a highly parameterized inverse problem two types of regularization were applied first singular value decomposition svd was used doherty 2015 svd separates those parameters that are informed by the calibration data set the so called solution space from those that are insensitive to observations the so called null space the inverse problem is simplified by reducing the number of parameters subject to estimation by those that do not contribute to the minimization of the objective function the benefit of svd regularization is numerical stability the other type of regularization is tikhonov regularization doherty 2003 where additional information in form of prior knowledge on the parameters are given to the optimization in order to constrain the values of the parameters tikhonov regularization increases the chance of obtaining a well posed problem doherty 2015 here preferred value regularization was used initial values equal to preferred values and bounds of hydraulic conductivities were carefully chosen based on results of rasmussen and sonnenborg 2014 and hydrogeological feasibility e g sedimentation conditions clay content parameters of similar hydrofacies had the same initial parameter value estimated parameters were considered reliable if they fell into typical ranges of the respective hydrofacies based on sedimentation environment and clay content 3 3 4 target data and objective function two different observation data sets see section 2 2 were successively used as optimization targets 1 the most recent hydraulic head measurements from 1081 wells with respect to uncertainty the head measurements were divided into three classes according to the time of measurement number of observations and measurement method sonnenborg et al 2003 standard deviations of 1 2 and 4 m were assigned to the three classes 2 river discharge at three locations was available representing the average stream discharge of the years 2000 2010 the weight of the river discharge was based on an assumed measurement uncertainty corresponding to a standard deviation of 10 of average stream discharge which is in line with sonnenborg et al 2003 the objective function that was minimized by pest was defined as the squared sum of weighted residuals of hydraulic heads h and stream flow d with a group weight ratio αh αd of 10 1 2 ϕ m α h i 1 m ω hi h obs i h sim i 2 α d j 1 n ω dj d obs j d sim j 2 where m and n are the numbers of the respective observations α is the group weight ω is the weight of the observations equal to the inverse of the standard deviation h is hydraulic head d is stream discharge obs is the observed value and sim the simulated one if regularization was involved a term for the regularized objective function φr was added to the measurement objective function φm this consisted of the weighted least squares measure of the discrepancies between parameters and their preferred values the total objective function φt was finally composed of the sum of the measurement and the regularization objective function 3 ϕ t ϕ m μ 2 ϕ r where μ is the weight factor of the regularization objective function if sufficient parameters are included in the optimization it may be possible to minimize the objective function below the level that uncertainties in observations and model can justify this so called overfitting will typically happen at the expense of unrealistic parameter estimates to avoid this problem an acceptable level of fit to the observed data phimlim doherty 2016a was specified this constant defines the target measurement objective function below which the optimization was not allowed to fall the goal was to obtain a better and more realistic parameter set with little degradation in model to measurement fit as a result the variable phimaccept was specified to inform pest about an acceptable upper limit of the objective function while an attempt to adjust the parameter estimates was done between phimlim and phimaccept the system was allowed to adjust to the preferred parameter values at the expense of the match to the observed data however while still maintaining the objective function within an acceptable range in the experiments h tik and hd tik see table 3 both svd and tikhonov regularization were applied in a first attempt phimlim was set close to zero to see how much the objective function can be minimized in the following run phimlim was set about 5 higher than the lowest achieved objective function and phimaccept another 5 higher than phimlim doherty and hunt 2010 3 3 5 calibration evaluation the different calibration experiments were assessed based on the mean error me and root mean square rms for heads 4 me 1 n h obs h sim 5 rms 1 n h obs h sim 2 river stream discharge was evaluated based on the relative mean squared error msre bennett et al 2013 6 msre d obs ε d sim ε d obs ε 2 with ε the measurement noise equivalent to 10 of the stream discharge observation these statistics show how well the observations can be reproduced by the model but they do not inform about the reliability of the estimated parameters where svd or tikhonov regularization were applied the parameter uncertainty was estimated based on linear statistics identifiability relative parameter error variance reduction and prediction uncertainty doherty and hunt 2009 considering parameters as model predictions 95 confidence intervals of parameter estimates can be calculated based on these statistics doherty 2015 linear analysis assumes multinormal distributions of probabilities related to the covariance of parameters c k and errors c ε as well as linearity between model inputs and predictions doherty 2015 however several groundwater calibration studies e g james et al 2009 knowling and werner 2016 showed that linear analysis provide valuable information in non linear systems the groundwater utility genlinpred doherty 2016b offers several subroutines that produce these statistics the parameter identifiability calculated with the groundwater utility identpar doherty 2016b 2015 describes to which extent a parameter can be estimated uniquely and is based on the decomposition concept of the calibration space that divides parameters into the solution space and the null space this analysis points out to which extent a parameter lies in the solution space and hence is informed by the available observation data a parameter with an identifiability of 1 lies completely in the solution space it can be constrained by the available observations and its error is a function of measurement noise if the identifiability of a parameter is close to zero it means that the parameter is insensitive to the observations and in consequence does not contribute to the minimization of the objective function the impact of the estimation of a parameter expressed as the reduction in error variance can be measured by the relative parameter error variance reduction revi 7 rev i 1 σ ei 2 σ i 2 if the parameter error variance after calibration σ ei 2 is much smaller than the pre calibration one σ i 2 revi reaches 1 while in the opposite case where the error variance remains high or even increases revi will be zero or even negative which could be a sign of overfitting doherty 2015 the groundwater utility predunc doherty 2016b was used to obtain the 95 confidence intervals of the parameter estimates of case hd tik considering each single parameter as a model prediction hereby the confidence interval of each ith parameter was based on the variance of the post calibration sensitivity matrix 8 σ i 2 y t z t c 1 ε z c 1 k 1 y where y are the sensitivities of the prediction here the parameter to model parameters z the post calibration jacobian c ε the covariance matrix of errors c k the covariance of parameters and k the parameter vector doherty 2015 eq 7 4 2 page 150 given that ε and k are multinormal distributed doherty 2015 each parameter estimate is used as a prediction and hence the vector y contains only zeros except for this parameter doherty 2016b the impact of parameter uncertainty on the water balance predictions was assessed by running six scenarios using upper and lower confidence limits of the identifiable parameters while the other parameters were kept to their estimates hd tik the extreme cases were simulated in scenarios 1 and 2 using the lower and upper parameter values respectively another four scenarios were used to represent i a two aquifer system separated by an aquiclude where upper limits are used for all quaternary units and miocene sand units as well for vertical hydraulic conductivity while lower limits were used for miocene clay units scenario 3 ii a system where horizontal flow is enhanced compared to vertical by applying upper parameter limits to all horizontal conductivities and lower limits to all vertical ones scenario 4 iii a system where deep flow is dominating by applying upper limits to all parameters except for pleistocene units where lower limits where used scenario 5 iv a system where shallow flow is favored with lower limits used for all parameters besides the pleistocene units where upper limits were used scenario 6 for brevity only results of the two extreme scenarios will be discussed in detail as the others fall in between 4 results 4 1 calibration results the calibration error statistics of the different experiments are shown in fig 7 the goodness of fit of the head measurements evaluated using the me and rms are satisfying for all experiments considering a total head difference of 46 1 m across the model area the me of heads is reduced by between 51 calibration experiment h and 86 calibration experiment h svd compared to the uncalibrated model and the rms by between 20 calibration experiment zones and 27 calibration experiment h svd stream discharge simulations are evaluated based on msre for each single station and their average including stream discharge observations as optimization targets during calibration experiment hd tik improves the average msre by 57 compared to pre calibration as these performance statistics only indicate how well the simulations based on the estimated parameters are able to reproduce the observations they do not evaluate if the parameter values are realistic or not the estimated parameter values for the different calibration experiments are illustrated in fig 8 together with initial estimates i e preferred values and predefined upper lower bounds the 95 confidence intervals of the experiment zone shown in fig 8a indicate that basically only two hydraulic conductivity parameters ps and qsh can be estimated precisely while all other parameters have a relatively large 95 confidence interval extending over several magnitudes and in some cases crossing the parameter bounds the experiments h and h svd where no expert knowledge was incorporated using tikhonov regularization show a large variation in parameter values fig 8b even for hydrofacies that represent similar sedimentation environment and clay content and therefore were expected to have a similar hydraulic conductivity further 11 out of the 50 estimated parameters reach their bound in experiment h and 22 in experiment h svd hence it is not possible to obtain a reliable calibration result when all hydraulic conductivities of the hydrofacies are estimated without regularization and svd regularization alone is not sufficient to constrain the problem in experiments h tik and hd tik where tikhonov regularization was used to incorporate expert knowledge the parameters vary smoothly around their preferred values and only two in experiment h tik and one in experiment hd tik out of the 50 parameters reach a bound the differences between the parameters estimated for experiment h tik and hd tik are relatively small however including stream discharge observations as calibration target results in a lower mrse for all stations figs 7 9 except for one outlier all simulated heads fit within two standard deviations of the observed heads fig 9c additionally the correlation between observed and simulated heads and stream discharge is acceptable fig 9a b excellent error statistics a reduction of me head by 80 of rms head by 25 of msre stream discharge by 57 and reliable parameter estimates are obtained figs 7 and 8 hence calibration experiment hd tik is found to be superior to the other experiments fig 10 a shows the identifiability for calibration experiment hd tik with a truncation of the solution space at a singular value index of 21 eighteen of the 50 parameters showed an identifiability higher than 0 75 the color coding corresponds to the contribution of the singular values to the identifiability warmer colors red yellow correspond to singular value of smaller indices and indicate that the parameters are less prone to measurement noise and more informed by observation data anderson et al 2015 doherty 2015 on the other hand 25 parameters have an identifiability close to zero 0 2 hence their uncertainty is not significantly reduced through calibration the parameters with a high identifiability also show a high relative error variance reduction and narrow 95 confidence intervals fig 10b as parameters with cooler colors blue green are more sensitive to measurement noise they have a lower relative error variance reduction fig 10b than those of warmer colors doherty and hunt 2009 comparing identifiability and relative error variance reduction with the estimated parameters and the initial preferred value reveals that those parameters with a higher identifiability deviate more from the preferred values than those with a lower identifiability hence the information contained in the observation dataset constrain the highly identifiable parameters while the ones that are not identifiable are stronger constrained by expert knowledge in form of preferred value tikhonov regularization this becomes also evident from the 95 confidence intervals of the parameter estimates calculated on the basis of eq 8 estimates with a narrow confidence interval coincide with high identifiability fig 10 the spatial distribution of the identifiability is shown in fig 11 parameters that are more identifiable include two miocene clay unit mc3 mc6 måde two miocene sand units ms1 and ms3 four pleistocene clay units qc1 qc6 qc13 qc14 seven pleistocene sand units qs1 qs2 qs3 qs4 qs5 qs6 qs7 the two anisotropy factors and the river conductance parameters with a low identifiability 0 2 include mostly clay units both miocene and pleistocene and a few pleistocene sand units as well as drain conductance the differences in identifiability will be explained in the discussion 4 1 1 sensitivity of the water balance to parameter uncertainties the impact of parameter uncertainty as per 95 confidence intervals on water balance predictions relative to the case hd tik are shown in table 4 in the upstream area defined as the area outside the marsh area no big differences in the overall water balance are observed changes in the total inflow and outflow are less than 10 compared to hd tik however major changes are observed for the ocean boundary inflow up to 734 higher in scenario 4 and the outflow to the marsh area subsurface outflow up to 126 higher in scenario 2 it should be noticed that these components only make up a minor part of the total volumetric upstream water balance less than 1 and 3 respectively in the marsh area the interaction with the ocean inflow up to 303 higher in scenario 2 and outflow up to 440 higher in scenario 5 and the subsurface inflow up to 126 higher in scenario 2 and outflow to the upstream area up to 153 higher in scenario 5 are most sensitive to parameter uncertainty these components constitute a larger part in the total volumetric water balance of the marsh area inflow from the ocean makes up to 16 of total inflow inflow from the upstream area accounts for up to 24 both for scenario 2 moreover the discharge through rivers and drains changes by up to 33 and 26 respectively scenario 2 these components constitute major elements of the water balance in the marsh area 53 and 34 of the total outflow in scenario 2 the total inflow and outflow to the marsh area is affected by up to 36 scenario 2 4 2 regional flow patterns on a regional scale the area comprises two main aquifer systems the shallow pleistocene aquifers and the deeper miocene aquifers which are separated by the måde formation fig 5 the deeper aquifer system is characterized by miocene sands ms1 ms4 16 m d kh 43 m d which are interbedded by miocene clay mc1 mc5 0 14 m d kh 0 23 m d partly as layers these deeper aquifer is overlain by the måde formation thick units of low permeable marine miocene clays mc6 mc7 0 008 m d kh 0 016 m d which occur more patchy towards the east and the north extent and thickness of the måde are illustrated in fig 13d the pleistocene aquifer system consists of a glaciotectonic complex and very heterogeneous deposits of sand qs 1 m d kh 83 m d partly interbedded with clays qc 0 028 m d kh 0 19 m d these deposits also fill the quaternary buried valleys that cut through the low permeable layers and connect the miocene and pleistocene aquifers the vertical hydraulic anisotropy factors were calibrated to 25 for clay and 85 for sand deposits resulting in vertical hydraulic conductivity ranges of 3 10 4 m d 9 5 10 3 m d for clay and 0 011 m d 0 98 m d for sand respectively given the heterogeneity especially in the glacio tectonic complex these values appear reasonable figs 12 and 13 show the regional flow pattern based on the calibration experiment hd tik hydraulic head contour lines are shown at the model top fig 12a at a depth of 150 m below surface b s fig 12b and at two e w cross sections fig 12c and d the main flow direction is ne sw in the northern part of the model and e w in the southern part of the model from the recharge areas at the jutland ridge towards the discharge areas near the coast interaction between the aquifer systems can be derived from fig 13abc showing the fluxes at different depths and from fig 12b background colors illustrating head differences between the second layer and a depth of 150 m b s in the shallow system fig 13a the distribution of flux is dominated by the river system and the drained marsh area 80 of the river reaches are gaining fig 14 a and constitute locations of preferred groundwater upwelling fig 13a red colors downward fluxes mostly occur between the rivers locally exceeding the average recharge value recalling that the average of the distributed recharge assigned to the 1st model layer is 465 mm y and locally recharge values reach up to 1147 mm year the marsh area has an important function in the hydraulic system of the whole area as it works as a huge regional sink controlled by the drains with elevations lower than the sea level 0 m see fig 5 groundwater is forced to move upward from the deeper systems preferentially through the buried valleys and most of the water is captured before it can discharge to the ocean in the upper system groundwater flows horizontally towards the marsh area fig 12a c d the special role of the marsh area is also evident from the water balance illustrated in fig 14a for the marsh area and the upstream areas respectively in the marsh area drains capture most of the water 78 of total outflow while in the upstream area the discharge to drains and rivers is comparable the marsh area receives a significant portion of its inflow 16 from the surrounding areas subsurface moreover it plays an important role in the interaction with the ocean because of the depression in hydraulic head generated by the drainage system a landward gradient is established and inflow from the sea is observed fig 12c d 95 of the total inflow from the coastal boundary takes place to the marsh area while only 10 of the total discharge to the ocean originates from the marsh most of the inflow from the sea takes place through the miocene sand layers or the buried valleys that connect to the sea the cross sections in fig 12c and d show the different geological connections to the ocean where the buried valley constitute a direct connection to the ocean fig 12c the flow direction and head distribution show the typical pattern of circulating groundwater flow in coastal zones post et al 2013 recalling that the constant head boundary at the coast was corrected for density effects ocean water also intrudes through the permeable miocene sand layers fig 12d while being blocked by the low permeable miocene units and the måde unit and finally meets the freshwater in the buried valley again groundwater discharge to the ocean is primarily observed in areas north of the marsh area where the coastal topography and hence the head gradient is higher the deeper aquifer systems fig 13b show mostly downward flux in the east and upward flux in the west the downward fluxes do not exceed average recharge values except in the very east where most of the recharge to the lower aquifer system occurs the interaction between the shallow and deep aquifer systems is partly controlled by the extent and thickness of the måde aquitard separating the two aquifers fig 13d where the måde is present and thick the water exchange between the upper and lower aquifers is low the thicker the måde the less water exchange the buried valleys represent another key feature in the regional flow system for both groundwater exchange between the deep and the shallow aquifers as well as for interaction with the ocean in the vicinity of the buried valleys mixing exchange of groundwater from the deep and the shallow aquifers takes place except for one branch of the buried valleys the flux is generally upwards reaching up to 200 mm y locally up to 500 mm y fig 13b the head difference between a depth of 150 m b s and the top also reveals upward blue and downward red flow areas fig 12b the flow field is illustrated with 3d vectors which are color coded according to their velocity the highest flow velocities are found in the miocene sand layers channelized by the surrounding low permeable miocene clay fig 12c and d and in the shallower quaternary sand 5 discussion a calibrated groundwater model was used to obtain new insights into and physical understanding of a complex regional scale coastal groundwater surface water flow system near the wadden sea at the danish german border a highly detailed voxel geology was translated into hydrogeological units each attributed with a hydraulic conductivity which were estimated using regularized inversion based on head and stream discharge observations 5 1 calibration results the different calibration experiments yielded information about the degree of structural complexity and parameter constraints regularization that were needed to match the observation data and at the same time achieve reliable parameter estimates and preserve hydro geological heterogeneity the structural simpler model zone did not capture the heterogeneity in hydraulic conductivities to the same degree as the highly parameterized models fig 8 for example the parameter qsh fig 8a in the experiment zone is described by thirteen units qs1 qs13 fig 8b and c in the highly parametrized models that varies by almost two orders of magnitude experiments zone and h performed equally well with respect to the misfit statistics fig 7 as experiment zone was based on the most sensitive parameters a relatively good fit to the data is not surprising however the evaluation of parameter estimates revealed that in experiment h several parameters seemed unreliable as they reached the bounds and based on results from subsequent calibration experiments it can be possible that a local minimum in the objective function instead of a global was reached the combination with mathematical regularization svd as in experiment h svd resulted in a good match to observation data and preserved a higher level of heterogeneity however parameter estimates were less reliable as they reached their bounds and varied more than expected incorporating stream discharge observations and expert knowledge through tikhonov regularization provided the best error statistics with a reduction of the me heads of 80 rms head of 25 and average msre stream discharge of 57 as well as the most trustworthy parameter estimates linear parameter uncertainty analysis revealed that 18 out of the 50 calibrated parameters were identifiable the effect of parameter uncertainty on water balance predictions revealed that in absolute numbers the water balance components were relatively insensitive below the limitations and uncertainties of model structure and parameters are assessed and a detailed interpretation of the flow system the relevant physical processes and their interactions is provided 5 2 limitations and uncertainty of the model uncertainties originated from different sources at different levels of the modelling process and affected the geological model as well as structural and parameter uncertainty of the flow model while uncertainty in the geological model and the structure of the flow model were addressed more qualitatively more effort was put into the analysis of the parameter uncertainty uncertainty of the geological model originate from combining different modelling techniques variability in data density and the resolution capacity boreholes seismic lines aem data which is addressed in more detail in jørgensen et al 2015 some internal geological structures might still not be resolved with the current model and some might be incorrectly interpreted jørgensen et al 2015 however heterogeneities in geology were resolved at an unprecedented small scale 100 m 100 m 5 m considering the size of the model area 1300 km2 the hydrogeological voxel model describes the spatial distribution of 46 hydrofacies at this scale each hydrofacies may describe a coherent formation or an irregular distribution of e g moraine deposits however while the heterogeneity associated with the distribution of hydrofacies was taken into account homogeneity was assumed within each of the 46 hydrofacies this is an assumption that especially for the hydrofacies covering large areas should be noted ignoring intra hydrofacies heterogeneity and disregarding small scale heterogeneities e g in hydraulic conductivity can have an effect on local measurement simulation results even though intra facies heterogeneity was not accounted for the relative good calibration results indicated that it might not be of major importance for the present system two different parameterizations were used to investigate the structural uncertainty the impact of different regularizations svd and tikhonov was investigated as well as different observation data types hydraulic head and stream discharge even though all experiments produced excellent error statistics and data fit compared to similar sized groundwater models in similar areas e g rasmussen and sonnenborg 2014 sonnenborg et al 2003 it was also shown that achieving a good match in terms of me and rms did not automatically lead to the most reliable parameter estimates this finding is consistent with hill and tiedeman 2007 and knowling and werner 2016 rather it requires a good knowledge of the system characteristics e g hydraulic conductivities that can be introduced to the calibration via expert knowledge in form of regularization to constrain parameters to realistic values parameter uncertainty analysis revealed that acceptable confidence intervals were obtained for only two parameters for the simple model zones using traditional parameter estimation the complex parameterization using tikhonov regularization based on both head and stream discharge measurements produced the best results in terms of error statistics and credibility of parameter estimates here identifiability and relative parameter error variance reduction were applied to evaluate the parameters estimability and revealed that 18 out of the 50 parameters were identifiable the identifiability of a parameter depended on the information content of the calibration data set here the head and stream discharge observations as expected those units with high observation density showed a high identifiability doherty and hunt 2009 which applies mainly to the pleistocene sand units as most of the head observations were located in shallow aquifers and the buried valleys the identifiability of most of the clay units were relatively low as none of the head observations were from these units however the måde formation low permeable miocene clay mc6 was identifiable even though there were no direct observations within this hydrofacies this is because it plays a key role on the overall hydrogeological system by separating the shallow and deep aquifer systems hence a head gradient between the aquifers is enforced and the formation was consequently informed indirectly by the head observations in the two aquifers also the vertical hydraulic anisotropy factor was highly identifiable for both sand and clay units because they govern the vertical flow and thus the exchange of groundwater between the shallow and deeper aquifer systems which is an important feature in the flow system the river conductance governing the interaction between groundwater and rivers showed a high identifiability as stream discharge observations were available on the other hand drain conductance was not identifiable as no information about the flux through the drains were available narrow parameter uncertainty intervals coincided with high identifiability and warmer colors fig 10 as they were constrained by the observations and were less affected by measurement noise anderson et al 2015 doherty 2015 it should be noticed that uncertainty intervals tend to be underestimated due to the underlying assumption of linearity doherty 2016a large uncertainties indicate that the pertinent parameters are not informed by the observations and or are correlated linear uncertainty analysis provided a computationally fast way to get information about the information content of an observation data set the estimability of calibrated parameters their tendency for errors and the uncertainty of resulting predictions doherty 2015 however it must be noted that this method assumes linearity of the model which is not true for most unconfined groundwater models and hence linear analysis results should be seen more as an approximation than exact results when employed to a non linear system doherty 2015 moore and doherty 2005 5 3 regional flow fig 15 combines the findings in a conceptual model of the groundwater river marsh ocean system that was constructed to address the questions raised by jørgensen et al 2012 concerning 1 the regional flow system and its characteristic features of buried valleys faults 2 land management and 3 the role of the miocene sand formations as active aquifers the regional flow system comprises two main aquifer systems a shallow glaciotectonically deformed pleistocene and a deeper layered miocene aquifer separated by a thick marine clay unit måde exchange of groundwater occurs through buried valleys cutting through the måde and hence connecting the two systems the heavily drained reclaimed marsh area adjacent to the ocean and protected by a dike works as a sink on a regional scale the difference between the water balance components of the marsh area and the upstream areas fig 14c highlighted the differences between the two areas in the upstream area rivers are the important sinks in fact rivers might be even more important than indicated by the water balance since small river branches were neglected in the model setup and compensated for by the drain network in the marsh area discharge through drains subsurface inflow and interaction with the ocean mostly intrusion govern the flow system the interaction with the ocean occurs predominantly through the miocene sand and buried valleys these features play key roles both for groundwater exchange between the aquifers as well as between the aquifers and the ocean other studies have stressed the role of a complex geology with distinct features on groundwater land ocean interactions seifert et al 2008 investigated the influence of buried valleys on aquifer vulnerability and mulligan et al 2007 showed that palaeo channels act as locations of preferential flow path for groundwater ocean interaction mulligan et al 2007 also identified different flow regimes in the palaeo channels with outflow predominately occurring at the flanks and inflow in the interior of the channels interestingly our simulations also indicate that the flanks of the buried valleys play an important role as higher upward and downward fluxes were observed here compared to the interior of a buried valley no significant submarine groundwater discharge occurred from the marsh area and it was relatively small in areas north outside the marsh approx 1 of the recharge this is very different from to the findings by haider et al 2015 who simulated submarine groundwater discharge at the ringkøbing fjord approx 100 km north of the investigation area to 59 of the recharge however in our case the extensive drainage in the marsh area captures most of the water and hence reduces direct groundwater discharge to the ocean significantly qualitatively the regional flow regimes are similar for the simpler zone fig 14b and the more complex hd tik models fig 14a however a closer inspection shows that the simpler model resulted in a higher interaction between the ocean and the subsurface than the more complex one this could be traced back to the estimated hydraulic conductivities of the miocene sand units where most of the exchange occurred which were higher in the simpler model than in the complex one the sensitivity of water balance components to parameter uncertainty for case hd tik fig 14a illustrates water balances for hd tik and scenarios 1 and 2 was small in the upstream area the biggest impact was observed on the ratio of the discharge through the rivers and drains 1 1 for scenario 1 and 1 58 for scenario 2 the higher the hydraulic conductivity of the quaternary sediments close to the surface is the lower is the water table and hence the less water is captured by drains in the marsh area the interaction with the ocean and the subsurface constitute substantial inflow components of the water balance these were relatively sensitive to parameter uncertainties which resulted in changes of up to 26 for recharge and 15 for each ocean and subsurface between scenario 1 and 2 in case of higher hydraulic conductivities scenario 2 the recharge formed a relatively smaller portion 55 of the total inflow as there was enhanced inflow from the ocean 16 and the subsurface 24 boundaries in case of lower hydraulic conductivities scenario 1 the recharge constituted 81 of inflow as ocean and subsurface boundary inflow contributed by only 3 and 10 respectively however the overall water balance components were relatively insensitive to parameter uncertainties and discharge patterns were captured by the parameter uncertainty intervals according to refsgaard et al 2012 predictions outside the calibration space are associated with significant higher uncertainty than predictions inside hence it will be interesting to investigate differences when simulating the progression of saltwater intrusion by including density driven flow and transport in the future thanks to the advanced calibration and uncertainty analysis provided here a good insight into the governing flow processes was established 6 conclusion our study shows the benefits of implementing new geological modelling techniques and calibration approaches into state of the art groundwater modelling where geological heterogeneity is preserved and expert knowledge accounted for this approach is in our opinion applicable in similar complex geological environments geological complexity is often simplified to stacked layers in regional groundwater models which might not be adequate to describe systems where distinct geological features and local heterogeneities can alter the flow system substantially in this study the geological complexity originating from glacial transformation during a sequence of glacial and interglacial periods leaving behind buried valleys and highly heterogeneous sediments was represented in a voxel model discretizing lithofacies information on local scale independently from layer structures the results of the numerical calibration experiments suggested that a complex parameterization together with svd and tikhonov regularization were required to achieve both reliable parameter estimates and an adequate level of heterogeneity fifty parameters were calibrated regularization with svd and tikhonov helped to stabilize and constrain the calibration process to yield a well posed inverse problem linear uncertainty analysis provided information about the estimability of parameters and the information content of observations to constrain parameters in absolute numbers the overall water balance components were relatively insensitive to parameter uncertainty however significant sensitivity was observed in the marsh area with respect to inflow across the ocean boundary and the subsurface inflow from the upstream area a good understanding of the flow system and a quantification of the impact of its associated uncertainty was achieved results from the flow model including a water balance served to identify the driving mechanisms recent anthropogenic changes such as land reclamation accompanied by dike construction and heavy drainage generated a large scale depression in the hydraulic head distribution this regional sink induces inflow from the ocean and collects a large part of the recharge generated in the areas to the east second regional geological features such as extensive clay layers and buried valleys form the most important structural components of the flow system the low permeable måde formation acts like an aquitard that separates the flow system up into a shallow pleistocene part and a deeper miocene part the buried valleys allow the water from the two systems to interact and primarily allow water from the miocene aquifers to emerge to the drains in the marsh area for the same reasons submarine groundwater discharge is low and significant inflow from the ocean boundary is observed in deeper miocene aquifers the knowledge obtained about the system underpins the hypothesis and clarifies the questions raised by jørgensen et al 2012 about the role of geological features and regional aquifer with a coastal boundary the interaction with ocean water will be pursued in future research by extending the model to simulate density dependent flow and transport the study site is representative for similar low lying anthropogenic influenced areas particular for regions along the wadden sea where a similar glacio geological evolution has taken place but also at other locations around the world where similar land reclamation and intensive use has been the answer to increasing population pressure and demand for water larsen et al 2017 acknowledgements the authors would like to acknowledge geocenter denmark for funding the study thanks to

7241,low lying coastal regions are often highly populated constitute sensitive habitats and are at the same time exposed to challenging hydrological environments due to surface flooding from storm events and saltwater intrusion which both may affect drinking water supply from shallow and deeper aquifers near the wadden sea at the border of southern denmark and northern germany the hydraulic system connecting groundwater river water and the sea was altered over centuries until the 19th century by e g the construction of dikes and drains to prevent flooding and allow agricultural use today massive saltwater intrusions extend up to 20 km inland in order to understand the regional flow a methodological approach was developed that combined 1 a highly resolved voxel geological model 2 a 1 million node groundwater model with 46 hydrofacies coupled to rivers drains and the sea 3 tikhonov regularization calibration using hydraulic heads and average stream discharges as targets and 4 parameter uncertainty analysis it is relatively new to use voxel models for constructing geological models that often have been simplified to stacked pseudo 3d layer geology the study is therefore one of the first to combine a voxel geological model with state of the art flow calibration techniques the results show that voxel geological modelling where lithofacies information are transferred to each volumetric element is a useful method to preserve 3d geological heterogeneity on a local scale which is important when distinct geological features such as buried valleys are abundant furthermore it is demonstrated that simpler geological models and simpler calibration methods do not perform as well the proposed approach is applicable to many other systems because it combines advanced and flexible geological modelling and flow calibration techniques this has led to new insights in the regional flow patterns and especially about water cycling in the marsh area near the coast based on the ability to define six predictive scenarios from the linear analysis of parameter uncertainty the results show that the coastal system near the danish german border is mainly controlled by flow in the two aquifers separated by a thick clay layer and several deep high permeable buried valleys that connect the sea with the interior and the two aquifers the drained marsh area acts like a huge regional sink limiting submarine groundwater discharge with respect to water balance the greatest sensitivity to parameter uncertainty was observed in the drained marsh area where some scenarios showed increased flow of sea water into the interior and increased drainage we speculate that the massive salt water intrusion may be caused by a combination of the preferential pathways provided by the buried valleys the marsh drainage and relatively high hydraulic conductivities in the two main aquifers as described by one of the scenarios this is currently under investigation by using a salt

three dimensional regional scale groundwater models have become increasingly important in supporting water management refsgaard et al 2010 combined with different types of available data and

alterations and making predictions e g on future water availability henriksen et al 2003 reilly et al 2008 coastal aquifers are particular challenging because they represent a physiography with an often complex geology and a variable landscape with low lying areas marshes near the coast stresses induced by historic water level changes in response to climate changes and human activities such as dike construction groundwater abstraction for water supply or irrigation and drainage may greatly affect the flow patterns salt water intrusion and water budgets of coastal aquifers e g delsman et al 2014 pauw et al 2012 the geological model forms the basis for a groundwater model that can be coupled to surface water systems such as rivers and the ocean geological voxel models are relatively new ways of constructing geological models and have recently been successfully applied jørgensen et al 2015 jørgensen and sandersen 2006 here the interpretation of geology is done directly onto a 3d grid and each grid cell contains lithological information independently from any layer structure has the flexibility to describe distinct geological features for example heterogeneities such as buried valleys kehew et al 2012 piotrowski 1994 can be of major significance for flow and transport by providing preferential flow paths for seawater mulligan et al 2007 but voxel models like other type of models rely on good geological data shortcomings of point measurements e g geological well logs in capturing spatial heterogeneity can be overcome if combined with areal geophysical data methods such as airborne electromagnetic aem surveys cover large areas in short time and provide useful information about electrical properties related to clay minerals and solute content in pore water however the link between geology and electrical properties is not unique additionally the resolution of the aem data decreases with penetration depth for more discussion see jørgensen et al 2013 recent studies by christensen et al 2017 marker et al 2015 and foged et al 2014 aim to automate the workflow from interpreting airborne geophysical data applying clay fraction modelling and integrating hydrological data to readily calibrated groundwater models while this approach provides an objective way in all steps it is challenged by ambiguity and therefore lacks the incorporation of geological expert knowledge that would be provided using cognitive modelling jørgensen et al 2013 therefore suggest to combine automated and cognitive geological modelling a complex description of the hydro geological architecture increases the requirements for systematic and robust parameter estimation during model calibration parameters like hydraulic conductivity porosity and boundary conditions are adjusted such that model outputs match historical measurements hill and tiedeman 2007 using only a few adjustable parameters ensures that the inverse problem is well posed hill 1998 when models are complex and the number of parameters high calibration can be difficult doherty and hunt 2010 as there is often more than one combination of parameters that yield equally satisfying simulations beven 2006 hill and tiedeman 2007 the problem of identifiability comes from the fact that the information content in the available data is too low because of few data or sometimes because the parameters are correlated or measurement noise is high carrera et al 2010 hill and tiedeman 2007 nevertheless tools to approach ill posed highly parameterized problems have become available during the last decade doherty 2003 2015 using regularized inversion it is possible to estimate a substantially higher number of parameters than in traditional calibration doherty 2003 regularization is applied to convert an ill posed problem into a well posed problem that can be solved one approach is to include knowledge on the system characteristics through tikhonov regularization doherty 2003 tikhonov and arsenin 1977 here preferred conditions on the parameters are specified to improve parameter uniqueness and stability of the estimation process different conditions can be applied doherty et al 2010 including preferred values based on e g pump test results or preferred differences based on e g knowledge of the depositional environment of the aquifer that can delineate relatively homogeneous formations another approach is singular value decomposition svd where combinations of parameters that are insensitive or highly correlated are identified and excluded from calibration the remaining parameter combinations are members of the solution space and are subject to calibration the two approaches can be combined hunt et al 2007 which increases the chance of solving a highly parameterized problem the use of regularized inversion complies well with the development of complex geological models where a large number of parameters have to be estimated linear doherty and hunt 2009 and non linear analysis techniques are available for exploring parameter and prediction uncertainty of regularized inversions and have been utilized in recent studies james et al 2009 keating et al 2010 knowling et al 2015 applied regularized inversion to a highly parameterized regional scale groundwater flow model and linear parameter uncertainty analysis to differentiate between climate and pumping impact on aquifer depletion they used a three layer geology and accounted for heterogeneity by using pilot points doherty 2003 in the two aquifer layers the number of studies combining a detailed geological model e g a voxel description with highly parameterized calibration is however limited this is exactly the methodological approach we want to develop investigate and apply to a danish regional aquifer system the objectives of the current study are to present a systematic approach for regional scale groundwater modelling where i a sophisticated geological voxel model jørgensen et al 2015 that describes the geological heterogeneity at local scale is converted into a hydrogeological model preserving as much geological information as possible on grid cell scale resulting in a 1 2 million node model ii model parameters are estimated using regularized inversion where as much expert knowledge as available is incorporated iii the parameter uncertainty is evaluated based on linear analysis and iv the impact of parameter uncertainty on water balance predictions is investigated the multi aquifer system at the wadden sea at the danish german border is used as a test case the overall aim is to understand groundwater flow and the interaction with surface water systems such as rivers drainage channels and the ocean in a complex hydrogeological setting investigations by jørgensen et al 2012 indicated that saltwater intrusions can be observed up to 20 km inland and they highlight the need for a highly resolved geological model and groundwater flow model in order to answer questions concerning 1 the regional flow and the impact of the distinct geological elements such as tunnel valley and faults and 2 anthropogenic influence such as heavy drainage system 3 the role of miocene aquifers in the regional flow system on and 4 the evolution and origin of the saltwater intrusion in this study salt water intrusion is not addressed 2 study area the transboundary model area fig 1 red line covers 1300 km2 and is partly located in southern denmark partly in northern germany at the wadden sea it is characterized by a low lying coastal area in the west with elevations below mean sea level m s l these marsh areas were reclaimed from the wadden sea during the last centuries by the construction of dikes and drains to make the land arable in the east the study area extends to the water divide of the jutland ridge formed during the late glacial maximum in the last weichselian glaciation with elevations of up to about 85 m above sea level m a s l the groundwater flow generally follows the present day topography from the ridge in the east to the low lands in the west fig 3 in order to enable agricultural use of the low lying area a dense network of drains and ditches keep the water level constantly below the ground surface large areas therefore have a groundwater table lower than mean sea level the maritime climate has a dominant wind direction from the north west transporting precipitation inland from the north sea orographic effects result in precipitation increasing from 900 mm year in the west to about 1100 mm year in the central area and the jutland ridge representing the period 1991 2010 rasmussen et al 2012 2 1 geology the area fig 1 blue line is located south of the ringkøbing fyn high at the northern margin of the north german basin the transition from the ringkøbing fyn high to the north german basin is defined by the rømø fault zone in which the tønder graben fault structure has evolved fig 1 fig 2 the outline of the tønder graben is expressed in the top chalk surface as elongated depressions trending nw se the fault offsets the deeper part of the sediment succession in the order of hundreds of meters ter borch 1991 low permeable paleogene clays fig 2 deposited in a deep marine environment are overlaid by miocene deposits which consist of marine clay silt and sand mainly deposited in deltaic environments rasmussen et al 2010 scharling et al 2009 the miocene deposits gently dip towards sw and are generally more sandy in the northeast than in the southwest fig 2 in the western part of the study area thick marine clays the måde group of the upper miocene occur fig 2 the miocene quaternary boundary is a widespread unconformity the måde formation is separating the shallower pleistocene units from the deeper miocene sands buried valleys are common in the entire study area jørgensen and sandersen 2006 the predominant quaternary deposits consist of clayey glacial till and meltwater sand the weichselian ice sheet only covered the easternmost part of the study area where it left behind a young morainic landscape fig 2 in the west the geology mainly consists of large meltwater plains surrounding gently undulating morainic plains left by the saalian glaciation smed 1981 glaciotectonic deformation is common in the area and old buried glaciotectonic complexes are found in many places both within the area jørgensen et al 2012 and nearby andersen 2004 høyer et al 2013 2 2 geological and hydrological data hydrological and borehole data fig 3 within the study area were available from different sources water levels from more than 1000 wells were extracted from jupiter the danish national database for geological and hydrological data geus www geus dk distributed net recharge was derived from the national water resources model of denmark henriksen et al 2003 and stream discharge measurements at three locations for the years 2000 2010 were available fig 2 a total of approx 170 km high resolution seismic lines were available within the study area fig 1 airborne transient electro magnetic aem data collected with the skytem system sørensen and auken 2004 and acquired with different setups in the period 2004 2013 were available for an area of 1500 km2 most of the surveys penetrate to around 150 200 m depth the aem data was inverted and gridded into a 3d resistivity grid with the dimensions 100mx100m laterally and 5 m vertically 3 material methods 3 1 geological model the final geological model was constructed as a voxel model combining a range of geophysical and geological data and innovative modelling techniques such as clay fraction cf multi point simulation mps and cognitive layer and voxel modelling as described in høyer et al 2017 and jørgensen et al 2015 a brief summary is provided here the area was discretized into grids with dimensions of 100 m 100 m laterally and 5 m vertically resulting in a total of 70 8 million voxels the model was constructed using the software geoscene3d i gis 2016 since the model area is relatively large and the geology in many places very complex the model was not entirely constructed by using manual modelling approaches automated modelling procedures were therefore applied in some areas the overall modelling approach is described in table 1 in combination with fig 2 within a part of the area the results from an already existing geological model jørgensen et al 2015 were reused the surfaces top pre quaternary bottom måde and top paleogene were modelled manually and used as boundaries in the subsequent automated modelling the paleogene and the måde group were defined as homogeneous formations since these deposits have only limited heterogeneity whereas the miocene and the quaternary were modelled using different voxel modelling methods the miocene succession was modelled using multiple point simulation mps guardiano and srivastava 1993 strebelle 2002 with the stanford geostatistical modelling software sgems remy et al 2009 this part of the geological model is described in detail in høyer et al 2017 a manually constructed 3d training image was designed on the basis of well known structures in the miocene rasmussen et al 2010 the geological interpretations of the seismic data kristensen et al 2015 were used as hard data despite the fact that depths in the seismic sections are known to be uncertain due to uncertainties related to stacking velocities hard conditioning was nevertheless utilized since the level of uncertainty of seismic data is assumed to be much lower than the uncertainty of the other available data especially since the scale of the structures delineated by the seismics is comparable to the scale of the simulated output the borehole information was gridded to a 3d grid and used as soft conditioning information since many of the boreholes are of low quality and the borehole information is discretized in another resolution 1 m compared to the simulation grid 5 m høyer et al 2017 the quaternary succession is in general extremely complex and an automated modelling routine was developed specifically for modelling this succession this routine combines borehole and aem data and a highly heterogeneous geological model was obtained the quaternary was modelled based on borehole gridding and translation of the resistivity grid into lithologies the detailed borehole descriptions were categorized into five lithologies sand gravel silt clay and clayey till and the voxel grid was locally populated with the lithologies encountered in the boreholes in areas with aem data the resistivity grid was translated into lithology based on typical resistivity values in areas without aem or borehole data coarser borehole gridding and manual interpretation were applied a representation of the final geological model consisting of 46 different units is shown in figs 2 and 4 the pre quaternary bluish colors is characterized by interchanging layers of miocene sand and clay that dip toward west the miocene sequence is intersected by several buried valley systems that at some locations cut through the entire formation fig 4 the tønder graben is also clearly seen in the central part of the area where a depression in the miocene layers is observed the heterogeneity of the quaternary is generally extensive both in the buried valleys and in the more surficial layers that are affected by glaciotectonic disturbances locally 3 2 numerical flow model numerical modelling of groundwater flow was performed with modflow 2000 harbaugh et al 2000 first a coast to coast modflow model covering approximately 2800 km2 fig 1 blue line was set up to simulate the regional groundwater flow in order to minimize the computation time the model area was reduced to 1300 km2 fig 1 red line bordering the west coast and delineated along water divides derived from the coast to coast model the model domain was divided into 237 rows and 313 columns with a horizontal discretization of 200 m in the west near the coast and 400 m in the east the western boundary was defined by the 37 5 km long coast line while the eastern boundary was defined by the water divide at the jutland ridge the grid extended to depths of about 450 m and was divided into 61 layers above an elevation of 10 m a s l the layers followed the topography of the area and have variable thicknesses between depths of 10 m and 150 m a s l the vertical discretization was 5 m and below 150 m a s l it was 10 m the top of the paleogene clay defined the model bottom the highly discretized heterogeneous geological model see section 3 1 served as a base for the regional scale steady state flow model the 3d regional flow field was simulated in steady state the geological voxel model was interpolated to the modflow grid using inverse distance with a constant nodal function and one nearest point to calculate the interpolation weight this way averaging was avoided and each grid cell contained geological information from only one geological unit the resulting 46 hydrogeological units are presented in table 2 showing the geological zones and their proportion in the numerical model homogeneity and anisotropy were assumed within each of the 46 hydrogeological units no flow boundaries were defined to the east north and south as well as at the bottom of the model fig 5 in the constant density modflow model the coastline in the west was represented by a constant head boundary with saline boundary heads corrected for freshwater heads taking density effects into account guo and langevin 2002 morgan et al 2012 post et al 2007 internal boundaries were implemented as recharge abstraction wells rivers and drains see fig 5 the net recharge data for the danish part of the area originated from the national water resources model of denmark henriksen et al 2003 the recharge for the german part was estimated based on the relation between topography and recharge at a cross section close to the border on the danish side the distributed net recharge was averaged over the years 1991 2010 and assigned directly to the groundwater table as a prescribed flux the average recharge was 456 mm year with a spatial standard deviation of 81 mm year abstraction data from 1827 danish wells extracted from jupiter and 14 german abstraction wells were included in the model with a total abstraction of 26 106 m3 year the abstraction rates were based on the average from 2000 to 2011 on the danish side and from 2009 on the german side the main rivers were described using the river package riverbed bottom elevations were assigned to 2 m below the surface from a digital elevation model dem with a resolution of 1 6 m 1 6 m the river depth was assigned as 0 2 m in the upstream areas and 0 5 m in the downstream areas the marsh areas in the west were highly drained to elevations below sea level see fig 5 to take smaller streams and ditches in the rest of the model area into account drains were defined in all other cells of the first active layer at an elevation of 1 m below ground surface based on the dem 1 6 m 1 6 m the drain return package banta 2000 was used to accumulate the total inflow within the catchment to a discharge station in order to use stream discharge observations during calibration drain and river conductances were estimated during the calibration 3 3 calibration and uncertainty analysis the flow model was calibrated using the parameter estimation tool pest doherty 2015 calibration complexity was added successively to the model by increasing the number of parameters while the inverse problem was successively more constrained by adding regularization as well as observation types used as optimization targets doherty 2015 p 54 sanford 2011 found that including flux information into the calibration mitigate the problem of non uniqueness that occurs when only potential observations are included following this not only head measurements but also direct measurements of stream discharge were included 3 3 1 calibration approach five different calibration experiments were performed to investigate 1 the influence of regularization manual and mathematical and 2 the influence of observational data types on the calibration results table 3 shows the set up with the experiment name the observation groups the number of parameters and the applied regularization method based on the geological model with 46 hydrogeological units two alternative parameterizations were defined the first approach called zone followed the principle of parsimony hill 2006 keeping the model as simple as possible but still as complex as necessary here the 46 geological units were reclassified to seven hydrofacies whose hydraulic conductivities were estimated in the other parameterization approach one hydraulic conductivity for each of the 46 units was calibrated in order to explore the impact of complexity in geology on calibration results riverbed and drain conductances as well as two vertical anisotropy factors the ratio of horizontal to vertical hydraulic conductivity kh kv for sand and clay were also estimated in the calibration process all parameters were log transformed during calibration 3 3 2 reclassification and sensitivity analysis for calibration experiment zone in order to regroup the 46 geological units to seven hydrofacies their sedimentation environments as well as their clay content were taken into account the geological description and group classification are shown in table 2 the seven hydrofacies include miocene clay deposited in a marine environment with high silt and clay content mc1 mc5 miocene clay deposited in a deep marine shelf environment namely the måde formation mc6 mc7 which is expected to have a very low permeability the third hydrofacies include miocene sands ms1 ms4 deposited in deltaic and lacustrine environments and having a low clay content hence a moderate permeability the pleistocene units were classified into four units including sand and clay with a low or high permeability respectively a formal local parameter sensitivity analysis of the horizontal hydraulic conductivities of the 46 units was carried out to identify the most sensitive parameters from each group shown in fig 6 the composite sensitivity si for the ith estimated parameter and n observations is calculated as 1 s i 1 n j n ω jj x ji 2 1 2 with ωjj the observation weight xji the derivative of simulated head value j to parameter i and n the number of observations a high sensitivity was found for units with a high frequency mc6 ms1 qs1 in the other groups this relation was not observed which could be due to the distribution of observation data finally calibration was carried out with the other group parameters tied to the most sensitive one in the group 3 3 3 regularized inversion in non unique calibration situations where more than one parameter set satisfy the calibration target equally well regularization can constrain and stabilize the calibration in order to reach uniqueness of a highly parameterized inverse problem two types of regularization were applied first singular value decomposition svd was used doherty 2015 svd separates those parameters that are informed by the calibration data set the so called solution space from those that are insensitive to observations the so called null space the inverse problem is simplified by reducing the number of parameters subject to estimation by those that do not contribute to the minimization of the objective function the benefit of svd regularization is numerical stability the other type of regularization is tikhonov regularization doherty 2003 where additional information in form of prior knowledge on the parameters are given to the optimization in order to constrain the values of the parameters tikhonov regularization increases the chance of obtaining a well posed problem doherty 2015 here preferred value regularization was used initial values equal to preferred values and bounds of hydraulic conductivities were carefully chosen based on results of rasmussen and sonnenborg 2014 and hydrogeological feasibility e g sedimentation conditions clay content parameters of similar hydrofacies had the same initial parameter value estimated parameters were considered reliable if they fell into typical ranges of the respective hydrofacies based on sedimentation environment and clay content 3 3 4 target data and objective function two different observation data sets see section 2 2 were successively used as optimization targets 1 the most recent hydraulic head measurements from 1081 wells with respect to uncertainty the head measurements were divided into three classes according to the time of measurement number of observations and measurement method sonnenborg et al 2003 standard deviations of 1 2 and 4 m were assigned to the three classes 2 river discharge at three locations was available representing the average stream discharge of the years 2000 2010 the weight of the river discharge was based on an assumed measurement uncertainty corresponding to a standard deviation of 10 of average stream discharge which is in line with sonnenborg et al 2003 the objective function that was minimized by pest was defined as the squared sum of weighted residuals of hydraulic heads h and stream flow d with a group weight ratio αh αd of 10 1 2 ϕ m α h i 1 m ω hi h obs i h sim i 2 α d j 1 n ω dj d obs j d sim j 2 where m and n are the numbers of the respective observations α is the group weight ω is the weight of the observations equal to the inverse of the standard deviation h is hydraulic head d is stream discharge obs is the observed value and sim the simulated one if regularization was involved a term for the regularized objective function φr was added to the measurement objective function φm this consisted of the weighted least squares measure of the discrepancies between parameters and their preferred values the total objective function φt was finally composed of the sum of the measurement and the regularization objective function 3 ϕ t ϕ m μ 2 ϕ r where μ is the weight factor of the regularization objective function if sufficient parameters are included in the optimization it may be possible to minimize the objective function below the level that uncertainties in observations and model can justify this so called overfitting will typically happen at the expense of unrealistic parameter estimates to avoid this problem an acceptable level of fit to the observed data phimlim doherty 2016a was specified this constant defines the target measurement objective function below which the optimization was not allowed to fall the goal was to obtain a better and more realistic parameter set with little degradation in model to measurement fit as a result the variable phimaccept was specified to inform pest about an acceptable upper limit of the objective function while an attempt to adjust the parameter estimates was done between phimlim and phimaccept the system was allowed to adjust to the preferred parameter values at the expense of the match to the observed data however while still maintaining the objective function within an acceptable range in the experiments h tik and hd tik see table 3 both svd and tikhonov regularization were applied in a first attempt phimlim was set close to zero to see how much the objective function can be minimized in the following run phimlim was set about 5 higher than the lowest achieved objective function and phimaccept another 5 higher than phimlim doherty and hunt 2010 3 3 5 calibration evaluation the different calibration experiments were assessed based on the mean error me and root mean square rms for heads 4 me 1 n h obs h sim 5 rms 1 n h obs h sim 2 river stream discharge was evaluated based on the relative mean squared error msre bennett et al 2013 6 msre d obs ε d sim ε d obs ε 2 with ε the measurement noise equivalent to 10 of the stream discharge observation these statistics show how well the observations can be reproduced by the model but they do not inform about the reliability of the estimated parameters where svd or tikhonov regularization were applied the parameter uncertainty was estimated based on linear statistics identifiability relative parameter error variance reduction and prediction uncertainty doherty and hunt 2009 considering parameters as model predictions 95 confidence intervals of parameter estimates can be calculated based on these statistics doherty 2015 linear analysis assumes multinormal distributions of probabilities related to the covariance of parameters c k and errors c ε as well as linearity between model inputs and predictions doherty 2015 however several groundwater calibration studies e g james et al 2009 knowling and werner 2016 showed that linear analysis provide valuable information in non linear systems the groundwater utility genlinpred doherty 2016b offers several subroutines that produce these statistics the parameter identifiability calculated with the groundwater utility identpar doherty 2016b 2015 describes to which extent a parameter can be estimated uniquely and is based on the decomposition concept of the calibration space that divides parameters into the solution space and the null space this analysis points out to which extent a parameter lies in the solution space and hence is informed by the available observation data a parameter with an identifiability of 1 lies completely in the solution space it can be constrained by the available observations and its error is a function of measurement noise if the identifiability of a parameter is close to zero it means that the parameter is insensitive to the observations and in consequence does not contribute to the minimization of the objective function the impact of the estimation of a parameter expressed as the reduction in error variance can be measured by the relative parameter error variance reduction revi 7 rev i 1 σ ei 2 σ i 2 if the parameter error variance after calibration σ ei 2 is much smaller than the pre calibration one σ i 2 revi reaches 1 while in the opposite case where the error variance remains high or even increases revi will be zero or even negative which could be a sign of overfitting doherty 2015 the groundwater utility predunc doherty 2016b was used to obtain the 95 confidence intervals of the parameter estimates of case hd tik considering each single parameter as a model prediction hereby the confidence interval of each ith parameter was based on the variance of the post calibration sensitivity matrix 8 σ i 2 y t z t c 1 ε z c 1 k 1 y where y are the sensitivities of the prediction here the parameter to model parameters z the post calibration jacobian c ε the covariance matrix of errors c k the covariance of parameters and k the parameter vector doherty 2015 eq 7 4 2 page 150 given that ε and k are multinormal distributed doherty 2015 each parameter estimate is used as a prediction and hence the vector y contains only zeros except for this parameter doherty 2016b the impact of parameter uncertainty on the water balance predictions was assessed by running six scenarios using upper and lower confidence limits of the identifiable parameters while the other parameters were kept to their estimates hd tik the extreme cases were simulated in scenarios 1 and 2 using the lower and upper parameter values respectively another four scenarios were used to represent i a two aquifer system separated by an aquiclude where upper limits are used for all quaternary units and miocene sand units as well for vertical hydraulic conductivity while lower limits were used for miocene clay units scenario 3 ii a system where horizontal flow is enhanced compared to vertical by applying upper parameter limits to all horizontal conductivities and lower limits to all vertical ones scenario 4 iii a system where deep flow is dominating by applying upper limits to all parameters except for pleistocene units where lower limits where used scenario 5 iv a system where shallow flow is favored with lower limits used for all parameters besides the pleistocene units where upper limits were used scenario 6 for brevity only results of the two extreme scenarios will be discussed in detail as the others fall in between 4 results 4 1 calibration results the calibration error statistics of the different experiments are shown in fig 7 the goodness of fit of the head measurements evaluated using the me and rms are satisfying for all experiments considering a total head difference of 46 1 m across the model area the me of heads is reduced by between 51 calibration experiment h and 86 calibration experiment h svd compared to the uncalibrated model and the rms by between 20 calibration experiment zones and 27 calibration experiment h svd stream discharge simulations are evaluated based on msre for each single station and their average including stream discharge observations as optimization targets during calibration experiment hd tik improves the average msre by 57 compared to pre calibration as these performance statistics only indicate how well the simulations based on the estimated parameters are able to reproduce the observations they do not evaluate if the parameter values are realistic or not the estimated parameter values for the different calibration experiments are illustrated in fig 8 together with initial estimates i e preferred values and predefined upper lower bounds the 95 confidence intervals of the experiment zone shown in fig 8a indicate that basically only two hydraulic conductivity parameters ps and qsh can be estimated precisely while all other parameters have a relatively large 95 confidence interval extending over several magnitudes and in some cases crossing the parameter bounds the experiments h and h svd where no expert knowledge was incorporated using tikhonov regularization show a large variation in parameter values fig 8b even for hydrofacies that represent similar sedimentation environment and clay content and therefore were expected to have a similar hydraulic conductivity further 11 out of the 50 estimated parameters reach their bound in experiment h and 22 in experiment h svd hence it is not possible to obtain a reliable calibration result when all hydraulic conductivities of the hydrofacies are estimated without regularization and svd regularization alone is not sufficient to constrain the problem in experiments h tik and hd tik where tikhonov regularization was used to incorporate expert knowledge the parameters vary smoothly around their preferred values and only two in experiment h tik and one in experiment hd tik out of the 50 parameters reach a bound the differences between the parameters estimated for experiment h tik and hd tik are relatively small however including stream discharge observations as calibration target results in a lower mrse for all stations figs 7 9 except for one outlier all simulated heads fit within two standard deviations of the observed heads fig 9c additionally the correlation between observed and simulated heads and stream discharge is acceptable fig 9a b excellent error statistics a reduction of me head by 80 of rms head by 25 of msre stream discharge by 57 and reliable parameter estimates are obtained figs 7 and 8 hence calibration experiment hd tik is found to be superior to the other experiments fig 10 a shows the identifiability for calibration experiment hd tik with a truncation of the solution space at a singular value index of 21 eighteen of the 50 parameters showed an identifiability higher than 0 75 the color coding corresponds to the contribution of the singular values to the identifiability warmer colors red yellow correspond to singular value of smaller indices and indicate that the parameters are less prone to measurement noise and more informed by observation data anderson et al 2015 doherty 2015 on the other hand 25 parameters have an identifiability close to zero 0 2 hence their uncertainty is not significantly reduced through calibration the parameters with a high identifiability also show a high relative error variance reduction and narrow 95 confidence intervals fig 10b as parameters with cooler colors blue green are more sensitive to measurement noise they have a lower relative error variance reduction fig 10b than those of warmer colors doherty and hunt 2009 comparing identifiability and relative error variance reduction with the estimated parameters and the initial preferred value reveals that those parameters with a higher identifiability deviate more from the preferred values than those with a lower identifiability hence the information contained in the observation dataset constrain the highly identifiable parameters while the ones that are not identifiable are stronger constrained by expert knowledge in form of preferred value tikhonov regularization this becomes also evident from the 95 confidence intervals of the parameter estimates calculated on the basis of eq 8 estimates with a narrow confidence interval coincide with high identifiability fig 10 the spatial distribution of the identifiability is shown in fig 11 parameters that are more identifiable include two miocene clay unit mc3 mc6 måde two miocene sand units ms1 and ms3 four pleistocene clay units qc1 qc6 qc13 qc14 seven pleistocene sand units qs1 qs2 qs3 qs4 qs5 qs6 qs7 the two anisotropy factors and the river conductance parameters with a low identifiability 0 2 include mostly clay units both miocene and pleistocene and a few pleistocene sand units as well as drain conductance the differences in identifiability will be explained in the discussion 4 1 1 sensitivity of the water balance to parameter uncertainties the impact of parameter uncertainty as per 95 confidence intervals on water balance predictions relative to the case hd tik are shown in table 4 in the upstream area defined as the area outside the marsh area no big differences in the overall water balance are observed changes in the total inflow and outflow are less than 10 compared to hd tik however major changes are observed for the ocean boundary inflow up to 734 higher in scenario 4 and the outflow to the marsh area subsurface outflow up to 126 higher in scenario 2 it should be noticed that these components only make up a minor part of the total volumetric upstream water balance less than 1 and 3 respectively in the marsh area the interaction with the ocean inflow up to 303 higher in scenario 2 and outflow up to 440 higher in scenario 5 and the subsurface inflow up to 126 higher in scenario 2 and outflow to the upstream area up to 153 higher in scenario 5 are most sensitive to parameter uncertainty these components constitute a larger part in the total volumetric water balance of the marsh area inflow from the ocean makes up to 16 of total inflow inflow from the upstream area accounts for up to 24 both for scenario 2 moreover the discharge through rivers and drains changes by up to 33 and 26 respectively scenario 2 these components constitute major elements of the water balance in the marsh area 53 and 34 of the total outflow in scenario 2 the total inflow and outflow to the marsh area is affected by up to 36 scenario 2 4 2 regional flow patterns on a regional scale the area comprises two main aquifer systems the shallow pleistocene aquifers and the deeper miocene aquifers which are separated by the måde formation fig 5 the deeper aquifer system is characterized by miocene sands ms1 ms4 16 m d kh 43 m d which are interbedded by miocene clay mc1 mc5 0 14 m d kh 0 23 m d partly as layers these deeper aquifer is overlain by the måde formation thick units of low permeable marine miocene clays mc6 mc7 0 008 m d kh 0 016 m d which occur more patchy towards the east and the north extent and thickness of the måde are illustrated in fig 13d the pleistocene aquifer system consists of a glaciotectonic complex and very heterogeneous deposits of sand qs 1 m d kh 83 m d partly interbedded with clays qc 0 028 m d kh 0 19 m d these deposits also fill the quaternary buried valleys that cut through the low permeable layers and connect the miocene and pleistocene aquifers the vertical hydraulic anisotropy factors were calibrated to 25 for clay and 85 for sand deposits resulting in vertical hydraulic conductivity ranges of 3 10 4 m d 9 5 10 3 m d for clay and 0 011 m d 0 98 m d for sand respectively given the heterogeneity especially in the glacio tectonic complex these values appear reasonable figs 12 and 13 show the regional flow pattern based on the calibration experiment hd tik hydraulic head contour lines are shown at the model top fig 12a at a depth of 150 m below surface b s fig 12b and at two e w cross sections fig 12c and d the main flow direction is ne sw in the northern part of the model and e w in the southern part of the model from the recharge areas at the jutland ridge towards the discharge areas near the coast interaction between the aquifer systems can be derived from fig 13abc showing the fluxes at different depths and from fig 12b background colors illustrating head differences between the second layer and a depth of 150 m b s in the shallow system fig 13a the distribution of flux is dominated by the river system and the drained marsh area 80 of the river reaches are gaining fig 14 a and constitute locations of preferred groundwater upwelling fig 13a red colors downward fluxes mostly occur between the rivers locally exceeding the average recharge value recalling that the average of the distributed recharge assigned to the 1st model layer is 465 mm y and locally recharge values reach up to 1147 mm year the marsh area has an important function in the hydraulic system of the whole area as it works as a huge regional sink controlled by the drains with elevations lower than the sea level 0 m see fig 5 groundwater is forced to move upward from the deeper systems preferentially through the buried valleys and most of the water is captured before it can discharge to the ocean in the upper system groundwater flows horizontally towards the marsh area fig 12a c d the special role of the marsh area is also evident from the water balance illustrated in fig 14a for the marsh area and the upstream areas respectively in the marsh area drains capture most of the water 78 of total outflow while in the upstream area the discharge to drains and rivers is comparable the marsh area receives a significant portion of its inflow 16 from the surrounding areas subsurface moreover it plays an important role in the interaction with the ocean because of the depression in hydraulic head generated by the drainage system a landward gradient is established and inflow from the sea is observed fig 12c d 95 of the total inflow from the coastal boundary takes place to the marsh area while only 10 of the total discharge to the ocean originates from the marsh most of the inflow from the sea takes place through the miocene sand layers or the buried valleys that connect to the sea the cross sections in fig 12c and d show the different geological connections to the ocean where the buried valley constitute a direct connection to the ocean fig 12c the flow direction and head distribution show the typical pattern of circulating groundwater flow in coastal zones post et al 2013 recalling that the constant head boundary at the coast was corrected for density effects ocean water also intrudes through the permeable miocene sand layers fig 12d while being blocked by the low permeable miocene units and the måde unit and finally meets the freshwater in the buried valley again groundwater discharge to the ocean is primarily observed in areas north of the marsh area where the coastal topography and hence the head gradient is higher the deeper aquifer systems fig 13b show mostly downward flux in the east and upward flux in the west the downward fluxes do not exceed average recharge values except in the very east where most of the recharge to the lower aquifer system occurs the interaction between the shallow and deep aquifer systems is partly controlled by the extent and thickness of the måde aquitard separating the two aquifers fig 13d where the måde is present and thick the water exchange between the upper and lower aquifers is low the thicker the måde the less water exchange the buried valleys represent another key feature in the regional flow system for both groundwater exchange between the deep and the shallow aquifers as well as for interaction with the ocean in the vicinity of the buried valleys mixing exchange of groundwater from the deep and the shallow aquifers takes place except for one branch of the buried valleys the flux is generally upwards reaching up to 200 mm y locally up to 500 mm y fig 13b the head difference between a depth of 150 m b s and the top also reveals upward blue and downward red flow areas fig 12b the flow field is illustrated with 3d vectors which are color coded according to their velocity the highest flow velocities are found in the miocene sand layers channelized by the surrounding low permeable miocene clay fig 12c and d and in the shallower quaternary sand 5 discussion a calibrated groundwater model was used to obtain new insights into and physical understanding of a complex regional scale coastal groundwater surface water flow system near the wadden sea at the danish german border a highly detailed voxel geology was translated into hydrogeological units each attributed with a hydraulic conductivity which were estimated using regularized inversion based on head and stream discharge observations 5 1 calibration results the different calibration experiments yielded information about the degree of structural complexity and parameter constraints regularization that were needed to match the observation data and at the same time achieve reliable parameter estimates and preserve hydro geological heterogeneity the structural simpler model zone did not capture the heterogeneity in hydraulic conductivities to the same degree as the highly parameterized models fig 8 for example the parameter qsh fig 8a in the experiment zone is described by thirteen units qs1 qs13 fig 8b and c in the highly parametrized models that varies by almost two orders of magnitude experiments zone and h performed equally well with respect to the misfit statistics fig 7 as experiment zone was based on the most sensitive parameters a relatively good fit to the data is not surprising however the evaluation of parameter estimates revealed that in experiment h several parameters seemed unreliable as they reached the bounds and based on results from subsequent calibration experiments it can be possible that a local minimum in the objective function instead of a global was reached the combination with mathematical regularization svd as in experiment h svd resulted in a good match to observation data and preserved a higher level of heterogeneity however parameter estimates were less reliable as they reached their bounds and varied more than expected incorporating stream discharge observations and expert knowledge through tikhonov regularization provided the best error statistics with a reduction of the me heads of 80 rms head of 25 and average msre stream discharge of 57 as well as the most trustworthy parameter estimates linear parameter uncertainty analysis revealed that 18 out of the 50 calibrated parameters were identifiable the effect of parameter uncertainty on water balance predictions revealed that in absolute numbers the water balance components were relatively insensitive below the limitations and uncertainties of model structure and parameters are assessed and a detailed interpretation of the flow system the relevant physical processes and their interactions is provided 5 2 limitations and uncertainty of the model uncertainties originated from different sources at different levels of the modelling process and affected the geological model as well as structural and parameter uncertainty of the flow model while uncertainty in the geological model and the structure of the flow model were addressed more qualitatively more effort was put into the analysis of the parameter uncertainty uncertainty of the geological model originate from combining different modelling techniques variability in data density and the resolution capacity boreholes seismic lines aem data which is addressed in more detail in jørgensen et al 2015 some internal geological structures might still not be resolved with the current model and some might be incorrectly interpreted jørgensen et al 2015 however heterogeneities in geology were resolved at an unprecedented small scale 100 m 100 m 5 m considering the size of the model area 1300 km2 the hydrogeological voxel model describes the spatial distribution of 46 hydrofacies at this scale each hydrofacies may describe a coherent formation or an irregular distribution of e g moraine deposits however while the heterogeneity associated with the distribution of hydrofacies was taken into account homogeneity was assumed within each of the 46 hydrofacies this is an assumption that especially for the hydrofacies covering large areas should be noted ignoring intra hydrofacies heterogeneity and disregarding small scale heterogeneities e g in hydraulic conductivity can have an effect on local measurement simulation results even though intra facies heterogeneity was not accounted for the relative good calibration results indicated that it might not be of major importance for the present system two different parameterizations were used to investigate the structural uncertainty the impact of different regularizations svd and tikhonov was investigated as well as different observation data types hydraulic head and stream discharge even though all experiments produced excellent error statistics and data fit compared to similar sized groundwater models in similar areas e g rasmussen and sonnenborg 2014 sonnenborg et al 2003 it was also shown that achieving a good match in terms of me and rms did not automatically lead to the most reliable parameter estimates this finding is consistent with hill and tiedeman 2007 and knowling and werner 2016 rather it requires a good knowledge of the system characteristics e g hydraulic conductivities that can be introduced to the calibration via expert knowledge in form of regularization to constrain parameters to realistic values parameter uncertainty analysis revealed that acceptable confidence intervals were obtained for only two parameters for the simple model zones using traditional parameter estimation the complex parameterization using tikhonov regularization based on both head and stream discharge measurements produced the best results in terms of error statistics and credibility of parameter estimates here identifiability and relative parameter error variance reduction were applied to evaluate the parameters estimability and revealed that 18 out of the 50 parameters were identifiable the identifiability of a parameter depended on the information content of the calibration data set here the head and stream discharge observations as expected those units with high observation density showed a high identifiability doherty and hunt 2009 which applies mainly to the pleistocene sand units as most of the head observations were located in shallow aquifers and the buried valleys the identifiability of most of the clay units were relatively low as none of the head observations were from these units however the måde formation low permeable miocene clay mc6 was identifiable even though there were no direct observations within this hydrofacies this is because it plays a key role on the overall hydrogeological system by separating the shallow and deep aquifer systems hence a head gradient between the aquifers is enforced and the formation was consequently informed indirectly by the head observations in the two aquifers also the vertical hydraulic anisotropy factor was highly identifiable for both sand and clay units because they govern the vertical flow and thus the exchange of groundwater between the shallow and deeper aquifer systems which is an important feature in the flow system the river conductance governing the interaction between groundwater and rivers showed a high identifiability as stream discharge observations were available on the other hand drain conductance was not identifiable as no information about the flux through the drains were available narrow parameter uncertainty intervals coincided with high identifiability and warmer colors fig 10 as they were constrained by the observations and were less affected by measurement noise anderson et al 2015 doherty 2015 it should be noticed that uncertainty intervals tend to be underestimated due to the underlying assumption of linearity doherty 2016a large uncertainties indicate that the pertinent parameters are not informed by the observations and or are correlated linear uncertainty analysis provided a computationally fast way to get information about the information content of an observation data set the estimability of calibrated parameters their tendency for errors and the uncertainty of resulting predictions doherty 2015 however it must be noted that this method assumes linearity of the model which is not true for most unconfined groundwater models and hence linear analysis results should be seen more as an approximation than exact results when employed to a non linear system doherty 2015 moore and doherty 2005 5 3 regional flow fig 15 combines the findings in a conceptual model of the groundwater river marsh ocean system that was constructed to address the questions raised by jørgensen et al 2012 concerning 1 the regional flow system and its characteristic features of buried valleys faults 2 land management and 3 the role of the miocene sand formations as active aquifers the regional flow system comprises two main aquifer systems a shallow glaciotectonically deformed pleistocene and a deeper layered miocene aquifer separated by a thick marine clay unit måde exchange of groundwater occurs through buried valleys cutting through the måde and hence connecting the two systems the heavily drained reclaimed marsh area adjacent to the ocean and protected by a dike works as a sink on a regional scale the difference between the water balance components of the marsh area and the upstream areas fig 14c highlighted the differences between the two areas in the upstream area rivers are the important sinks in fact rivers might be even more important than indicated by the water balance since small river branches were neglected in the model setup and compensated for by the drain network in the marsh area discharge through drains subsurface inflow and interaction with the ocean mostly intrusion govern the flow system the interaction with the ocean occurs predominantly through the miocene sand and buried valleys these features play key roles both for groundwater exchange between the aquifers as well as between the aquifers and the ocean other studies have stressed the role of a complex geology with distinct features on groundwater land ocean interactions seifert et al 2008 investigated the influence of buried valleys on aquifer vulnerability and mulligan et al 2007 showed that palaeo channels act as locations of preferential flow path for groundwater ocean interaction mulligan et al 2007 also identified different flow regimes in the palaeo channels with outflow predominately occurring at the flanks and inflow in the interior of the channels interestingly our simulations also indicate that the flanks of the buried valleys play an important role as higher upward and downward fluxes were observed here compared to the interior of a buried valley no significant submarine groundwater discharge occurred from the marsh area and it was relatively small in areas north outside the marsh approx 1 of the recharge this is very different from to the findings by haider et al 2015 who simulated submarine groundwater discharge at the ringkøbing fjord approx 100 km north of the investigation area to 59 of the recharge however in our case the extensive drainage in the marsh area captures most of the water and hence reduces direct groundwater discharge to the ocean significantly qualitatively the regional flow regimes are similar for the simpler zone fig 14b and the more complex hd tik models fig 14a however a closer inspection shows that the simpler model resulted in a higher interaction between the ocean and the subsurface than the more complex one this could be traced back to the estimated hydraulic conductivities of the miocene sand units where most of the exchange occurred which were higher in the simpler model than in the complex one the sensitivity of water balance components to parameter uncertainty for case hd tik fig 14a illustrates water balances for hd tik and scenarios 1 and 2 was small in the upstream area the biggest impact was observed on the ratio of the discharge through the rivers and drains 1 1 for scenario 1 and 1 58 for scenario 2 the higher the hydraulic conductivity of the quaternary sediments close to the surface is the lower is the water table and hence the less water is captured by drains in the marsh area the interaction with the ocean and the subsurface constitute substantial inflow components of the water balance these were relatively sensitive to parameter uncertainties which resulted in changes of up to 26 for recharge and 15 for each ocean and subsurface between scenario 1 and 2 in case of higher hydraulic conductivities scenario 2 the recharge formed a relatively smaller portion 55 of the total inflow as there was enhanced inflow from the ocean 16 and the subsurface 24 boundaries in case of lower hydraulic conductivities scenario 1 the recharge constituted 81 of inflow as ocean and subsurface boundary inflow contributed by only 3 and 10 respectively however the overall water balance components were relatively insensitive to parameter uncertainties and discharge patterns were captured by the parameter uncertainty intervals according to refsgaard et al 2012 predictions outside the calibration space are associated with significant higher uncertainty than predictions inside hence it will be interesting to investigate differences when simulating the progression of saltwater intrusion by including density driven flow and transport in the future thanks to the advanced calibration and uncertainty analysis provided here a good insight into the governing flow processes was established 6 conclusion our study shows the benefits of implementing new geological modelling techniques and calibration approaches into state of the art groundwater modelling where geological heterogeneity is preserved and expert knowledge accounted for this approach is in our opinion applicable in similar complex geological environments geological complexity is often simplified to stacked layers in regional groundwater models which might not be adequate to describe systems where distinct geological features and local heterogeneities can alter the flow system substantially in this study the geological complexity originating from glacial transformation during a sequence of glacial and interglacial periods leaving behind buried valleys and highly heterogeneous sediments was represented in a voxel model discretizing lithofacies information on local scale independently from layer structures the results of the numerical calibration experiments suggested that a complex parameterization together with svd and tikhonov regularization were required to achieve both reliable parameter estimates and an adequate level of heterogeneity fifty parameters were calibrated regularization with svd and tikhonov helped to stabilize and constrain the calibration process to yield a well posed inverse problem linear uncertainty analysis provided information about the estimability of parameters and the information content of observations to constrain parameters in absolute numbers the overall water balance components were relatively insensitive to parameter uncertainty however significant sensitivity was observed in the marsh area with respect to inflow across the ocean boundary and the subsurface inflow from the upstream area a good understanding of the flow system and a quantification of the impact of its associated uncertainty was achieved results from the flow model including a water balance served to identify the driving mechanisms recent anthropogenic changes such as land reclamation accompanied by dike construction and heavy drainage generated a large scale depression in the hydraulic head distribution this regional sink induces inflow from the ocean and collects a large part of the recharge generated in the areas to the east second regional geological features such as extensive clay layers and buried valleys form the most important structural components of the flow system the low permeable måde formation acts like an aquitard that separates the flow system up into a shallow pleistocene part and a deeper miocene part the buried valleys allow the water from the two systems to interact and primarily allow water from the miocene aquifers to emerge to the drains in the marsh area for the same reasons submarine groundwater discharge is low and significant inflow from the ocean boundary is observed in deeper miocene aquifers the knowledge obtained about the system underpins the hypothesis and clarifies the questions raised by jørgensen et al 2012 about the role of geological features and regional aquifer with a coastal boundary the interaction with ocean water will be pursued in future research by extending the model to simulate density dependent flow and transport the study site is representative for similar low lying anthropogenic influenced areas particular for regions along the wadden sea where a similar glacio geological evolution has taken place but also at other locations around the world where similar land reclamation and intensive use has been the answer to increasing population pressure and demand for water larsen et al 2017 acknowledgements the authors would like to acknowledge geocenter denmark for funding the study thanks to

7242,green infrastructure such as low impact development lid controls are being employed to manage the urban stormwater and restore the predevelopment hydrological conditions besides improving the stormwater runoff water quality since runoff generation and infiltration processes are nonlinear there is a need for identifying optimal combination of lid controls a coupled optimization simulation model was developed by linking the u s epa stormwater management model swmm to the borg multiobjective evolutionary algorithm borg moea the coupled model is capable of performing multiobjective optimization which uses swmm simulations as a tool to evaluate potential solutions to the optimization problem the optimization simulation tool was used to evaluate low impact development lid stormwater controls a swmm model was developed calibrated and validated for a sewershed in windsor ontario and lid stormwater controls were tested for three different return periods lid implementation strategies were optimized using the optimization simulation model for five different implementation scenarios for each of the three storm events with the objectives of minimizing peak flow in the stormsewers reducing total runoff and minimizing cost for the sewershed in windsor ontario the peak run off and total volume of the runoff were found to reduce by 13 and 29 respectively keywords stormwater management low impact development lid suds liudd wsud green infrastructure sustainability lid implementation multi objective optimization moo 1 introduction urbanization drastically changes hydrological patterns and flow regimes these changes often include increased peak flows reduced times of concentration redistribution of the water balance and flashier flows in urban streams and rivers chui et al 2016 konrad and booth 2005 li et al 2017 paule mercado et al 2017 todeschini 2016 wef 2012 urban areas can become prone to flooding and ecological degradation from accelerated stormwater runoff jennings et al 2012 mcgrane 2016 ecosystem damage and property damage from flooding often end up exceeding the cost of stormwater management visitacion et al 2009 rapid urbanization and climate change are expected to further increase the risk of flooding and drainage disasters in urban drainage systems duan et al 2016 stovin et al 2012 visitacion et al 2009 wang et al 2016 one way to combat this is the use of low impact development lid which is an emerging approach to stormwater management that is being utilized to reduce the impacts of urbanization and climate change on urban watersheds some of the commonly used lid controls include rain barrels rain gardens bioretention ponds and porous pavements the philosophy behind the lid approach is to attempt to replicate the hydrology of the pre development watershed lid uses distributed stormwater controls source controls and incorporates natural hydrologic features in order to detain water which in turn facilitates infiltration and evapotranspiration by doing so lid can reduce flooding and improve ecological conditions damodaram et al 2010 shuster et al 2008 van roon 2005 2007 van roon and knight lenihan 2004 lid has often been implemented as a retrofit designed to ease the stress on urban stormwater infrastructure as well as provide some resiliency to the impacts of climate change ahiablame et al 2012 jia et al 2012 liu et al 2015 the detailed investigations on the performance of the individual lid controls were performed for example on permeable pavements brunetti et al 2016 huang et al 2016 and bioretention units hathaway et al 2014 where there are a number of subcatchments within a catchment it can be difficult to determine which lid controls to place in each subcatchment or if any at all cano and barkdoll 2017 the selection and placement of lid controls such as number locations and combinations of controls can be abundant due to varying features the number of possible combinations may not be feasible to analyze particularly at a large scale determining the optimal placement and selection of controls is required to achieve maximum runoff reductions at the minimum costs liu et al 2016 the cost effectiveness of the lids from the point of view of life cycle assessment was investigated by chui et al 2016 and wang et al 2016 two tools that stormwater professionals can utilize to help them implement lid controls are simulation and optimization computer modeling is a powerful tool for the design and optimization of sewer systems ahmed et al 2017 akhter and hewa 2016 freni et al 2010 palanisamy and chui 2015 palla and gnecco 2015 wang et al 2016 xu et al 2017 zahmatkesh et al 2015 several models now include methods for simulating lid controls the most commonly used model for research is the u s environmental protection agency s stormwater management model swmm rossman 2010 to expediently assess and compare lid scenarios in a watershed optimization tools are extremely useful optimization tools have greatly improved and now allow for more accurate and less complex methods most often single objective optimization has been used however single objective optimization requires some objectives to be constrained to a target range or weighted a priori when attempting to optimize multiple objectives without making preference decisions prior to optimization multiobjective optimization is stronger one of the most common sets of multiobjective optimization tools used with lid controls are genetic algorithms genetic or evolutionary algorithms can be used to optimize multiple objectives and are easily linked with simulation models such as swmm baek et al 2015 duan et al 2016 jung et al 2016 karamouz and nazif 2013 and soil and water assessment tool swat kaini et al 2008 neitsch et al 2011 there are several genetic algorithms available to be used in multiobjective optimization and several improvements have been made over time for this study the genetic algorithm of choice is the borg multi objective evolutionary algorithm moea hadka and reed 2013 coupling a multi objective optimization model with swmm is being explored more recently for analyzing lid scenarios duan et al 2016 studied the multi objective optimal design of detention tanks and lid devices they used swmm for the numerical simulation and applied the modified particle swarm optimization npso scheme to solve the multi objective optimization problem baek et al 2015 combined swmm with matlab and used the pattern search algorithm to optimize lid sizes jung et al 2016 developed an optimization model using the harmony search hs algorithm coupled with swmm to determine the optimal design of permeable pavement liu et al 2016 have coupled their own lid simulator l thia lid 2 1 with amalgam an optimization algorithm developed by vrugt and robinson 2007 the ability to optimize multiple objectives is useful for the implementation of lid controls lid implementation allows for optimization in the selection placement and sizing of many lid controls throughout a site or watershed multi objective optimization provides the ability for one to develop multiple trade off solutions an example of this being a cost benefit curve prior to making preference decisions this allows stormwater professionals to present the stakeholders with a range of potential solutions and include their preferences into the design process it can also be utilized when conducting higher level planning exercises such as a drainage master plan in order to evaluate the potential benefits of lid implementation on a sewershed scale without spending significant effort in the design optimizing lids for cost allows one to compare the costs of many potential lid solutions to other stormwater structures and devices for this research a simulation optimization model was developed to generate cost benefit information for the selection of lid controls this study uses swmm borg moea and cost functions in order to examine the potential of lid controls to reduce total runoff over the study area and stormsewer peak flows at various cost levels the optimization simulation model developed is able to conduct multiobjective optimization so that cost benefit curves can be easily generated the model allows users to analyze the significance of various design parameters for lid controls 2 site description a sewershed in windsor ontario canada was used as a study area to develop and test the optimization simulation model the sewershed in question is a 77 ha residentially zoned suburban sewershed excluding undeveloped areas the study area is 49 5 covered by impervious surfaces with slopes generally less than 1 the distance from the location of the flow monitor in the sewershed to the nearest rain gauge is about 1 2 km the sewershed possesses characteristics which could make it poorly suited to lid implementation including primarily hydrological group d soils clay and clay loam with only a small portion underlain by type c sand the seasonally high water table is estimated to rise to a depth of about 1 m the sewershed primarily utilizes curb and channel drainage and is served by a stormsewer system which congregates at the flow monitor depicted in fig 2 before flowing into a trunk sewer 3 methodology an optimization simulation method was developed for the purpose of finding optimal strategies for the deployment of lid stormwater controls this type of model can provide stormwater practitioners with clearer design choices without having to make preference decisions a priori deb 2001 fig 2 depicts the layout of the system that was constructed as well as the data requirements in this optimization simulation methodology the simulation model swmm is used as a fitness function for the borg moea the optimization algorithm with the other fitness function being the cost functions that were developed for this study the components depicted in fig 2 are explained in greater detail in the following sections 3 1 hydrological modeling 3 1 1 model setup this study employs swmm version 5 1 to simulate urban hydrological processes with the study area and the effects of adding lid controls swmm has been an effective tool for modeling urban drainage networks and the recent versions include an lid toolbox for the simulation of a number of lid controls swmm has previously been used to study low impact development including those studies previously mentioned damodaram and zechman 2013 karamouz and nazif 2013 oraei zare et al 2012 zhang 2009 as well as some others bosley 2008 damodaram et al 2010 elliott and trowsdale 2007 maharjan et al 2009 mcgarity 2010 palanisamy and chui 2015 palla and gnecco 2015 qin et al 2013 rosa et al 2015 zahmatkesh et al 2015 the study area was divided into 292 non uniform subcatchments the subcatchment properties were determined through gis data satellite imagery and site inspection the network of links and nodes was created based on sewer maps obtained from the city of windsor swmm allows the option of choosing either green ampt method horton s method or the scs curve number cn method for determining infiltration the cn method was developed to calculate the runoff and eventually infiltration volumes in small urban watersheds which is the focus of this study this method was selected to compute infiltration losses because it has been previously used in studies focused on the optimization of an urban stormwater system maharjan et al 2009 and optimization simulation of lid controls using swmm zhang 2009 the cn method was used because of its basis on a single parameter and responsiveness to the runoff producing characteristics of urban watersheds both of these were listed as strengths of the method by ponce and hawkins 1996 the dynamic wave method was selected as the routing method because of its ability to account for channel storage backwater effects entrance exit losses flow reversal and pressurized flow rossman 2010 the main parameters for subcatchments are area percent impervious area width slope infiltration parameters manning s roughness coefficients for overland flow for pervious and impervious surfaces depression storage depth for pervious and impervious surfaces percent zero and internal routing parameters the percent impervious area and slope were determined using google earth the width was set as the distance from the back of the subcatchment to the street as suggested in gironás et al 2009 and then altered during the calibration process the function of the width is essentially to determine the overland flow distance which runoff must travel before becoming channelized the infiltration parameters mainly the curve number manning s roughness coefficients and storage depths were determined based on the sewershed characteristics mentioned in section 2 and the tables in the appendices of the swmm manual rossman 2010 these values were later calibrated the internal routing parameters describe if runoff from impervious areas is routed to pervious areas before the subcatchment outlet and if so what percentage of the runoff from impervious area is these were set largely based on inspection of the sewershed primarily to where downspouts were routing roof water the percent zero is the percent of the impervious area on which there is no surface storage primarily roofs this value was calibrated to 30 which lies in the typical range reported in zhang 2009 there are a few additional input parameters the evaporation was set to only occur during dry periods and was based on the monthly pan evaporation because these evaporation rates were used and snowmelt is not considered there is no need for a climate file with temperatures the equation selected for force main was the darcy weisbach equation the start and end times were selected to include the entire precipitation events and some time before and after where there is no precipitation as for the time controls the reporting interval was set to 5 min the wet calculation time step was set to 20 s while the dry step was set to 40 s the routing time step was set to 3 s because a very short time step is required for dynamic wave routing with these parameters the calculation error was consistently very low 3 1 2 calibration and validation flow data collected from a flow monitor position displayed in fig 1 and precipitation time series were used to calibrate the swmm model the precipitation time series used was the mean reading of the three rain gauges that surround the study area previous studies have used manning s roughness coefficient depression storage depth infiltration parameters e g curve number subcatchment width subcatchments percent imperviousness subcatchment slope percentage of impervious surfaces with no depression storage and channel roughness values as calibration parameters bosley 2008 liong et al 1991 warwick and tadepalli 1991 zhang 2009 to calibrate the model adjustments were made to the subcatchments imperviousness widths curve numbers and the percentage of the impervious surfaces with no depression storage in order to represent the hydrological processes in a realistic manner the model was simulated on a continuous time scale however we do not know the initial soil moisture conditions in the sewershed therefore starting the simulation somewhat earlier than the period over which calibration is performed we will be able to overcome any potential uncertainties in the initial conditions some of the hydrological simulation models refer this to warmup period which helps in establishing the starting conditions better two series of continuous simulations each containing multiple precipitation events were used for calibration and validation rainfall and flow monitoring data were provided by the city of windsor though precipitation data were available from october 10th 2012 to january 15th 2014 the selection of events was limited by the time period in which the flow monitor data was available reliable flow monitor data were only available from july 11th 2013 to mid november of the same year from this dataset two subsets of events one each for calibration and validation needed to be chosen while the flow data from any time interval could have been used the data collected between july 15 and july 24 2013 was arbitrarily chosen for calibration and the flow data collected between august 26 and august 31 2013 were used for validation a subset of events refer to the events that occurred in close proximity to each other and were simulated as one continuous simulation so that the model could be tested against consecutive series of events where initial saturation conditions would be changing the ability of the model to reproduce the observed results was numerically evaluated by calculating the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse for each series of events the nse values for calibration and validation were 0 79 and 0 93 respectively the results in terms of time series of flows are displayed in figs 3 and 4 3 1 3 lid controls swmm 5 includes an lid toolbox which allows lid measures to be implemented in the model making the evaluation of these controls much easier the lid toolbox includes the ability to define rain gardens bioretention cells infiltration trenches green roofs permeable pavements rain barrels and vegetative swales the lids are represented in the swmm model through the parameterization of several layers though not all lids have all the layers the creation of treatment trains can be done by creating subcatchments simply for a single lid controls and then route these subcatchments to each other five lid controls were deemed appropriate for use in the study area or a similar residential neighbourhood were selected for this study they include rain barrels porous pavement bioretention both engineered bioretention and simple rain gardens and infiltration trenches depending on the lid control selected parameters of the design were optimized within reasonable ranges while the other required swmm parameters were set based on lid design standards and study area characteristics such as land use available area soil infiltration characteristics slopes and depth to the water table the design guidelines and parameters for the lid controls were obtained from center for watershed protection 2010 cvc 2010 ontario moe 2003 rossman 2010 woods ballard et al 2007 the sources and unit costs used to calculate the capital costs of lid implementation were obtained through vendors the city of windsor and developers the subcatchment routing to lids was determined based on which lids were present in a given subcatchment the routing schemes can be seen in table 1 lid properties were optimized as decision variables the details of which are discussed in section 3 3 3 2 optimization multi objective optimization refers to the maximizing or more often the minimizing of multiple objectives f x f1 x f2 x fn x where x x1 x2 xn represent the decision variables the decision variables define the decision space where the feasible region is the set of solutions in the space which satisfy any constraints placed on the decision variables deb 2001 a single solution is a set of n values corresponding to a feasible value for each decision variable for example for the design and placement of rain barrels the decision variables might be the number of rain barrels per house constrained between 0 and 4 and the size of the rain barrels constrained to one of the commonly available sizes on the market the optimization goal for this study was to find the pareto optimal front for the objectives of minimizing peak flow in the stormsewers total stormwater runoff and cost such a procedure may be represented as the development of cost benefit curves the decision variables are various lid design parameters related to their definition in the swmm input file the fitness functions which evaluate the solutions taking the decision variables and returning objective values are the swmm model itself as well as cost functions this whole system is created by linking the swmm model to the borg moea so that there can be a feedback process where borg alters some swmm input parameters and receives outputs from the swmm model borg moea is an advanced genetic algorithm ga one unique benefit of gas is their ability to find multiple optimal solutions in a single run deb 2001 furthermore gas allow for a more evenly distributed pareto optimal set than what we may get by running several runs of a single optimization problem and altering the weights a priori deb 2001 gas are very adaptable and can be applied to a wide variety of problem types and scales sivanandam 2007 the fitness functions used are also very adaptable for example a fitness function might be a simple mathematical formula which uses the decision variable values to produce objective function values or it could be a hydrological model which uses the decision variables as some of its input parameters and produces outputs which are used as objective values one thing that can make it easier to use a ga is that they require no prior knowledge of the objective space sivanandam 2007 one final benefit of gas relevant to this study is that they are specifically designed to discover pareto optimal fronts sivanandam 2007 3 2 1 borg moea there are several genetic algorithms available to be used in multiobjective optimization and several improvements have been made over time for this study the genetic algorithm of choice is the borg multi objective evolutionary algorithm moea hadka and reed 2013 borg moea combines and enhances several processes used successfully in previous gas it has been used for water resource problems for example d ervau 2013 however it has not yet been widely used as it is still new tested against six state of the art moeas on several test problems borg met or exceeded the performance of the other moeas on most of the tests hadka and reed 2012 a complete description of the borg moea and important components can be found in hadka and reed 2013 borg is freely available for research purposes from borgmoea org borg moea is an elitist genetic algorithm meaning that in addition to the population borg also stores an elite archive of solutions the elite archive has more stringent dominance criteria than the population it is maintained throughout a run of borg and output product and the conclusion of the run a new solution is added to the population if it dominates at least one member of the population the dominated member of the population is replaced and if more than one member of the population is dominated by the new solution then one of the dominated solutions is removed at random hadka and reed 2013 3 2 2 objectives there are many possible combinations of low impact development controls which might be implemented in an urban or sub urban area but the primary objective of the optimization process is to find combinations of lids that will optimally reduce sewershed wide runoff and peak flow in the stormsewers while reducing the cost when implementing stormwater controls it is ideal to get the maximum performance reduction at the lowest cost equations 1 2 and 3 represent the three objectives for optimization by the borg algorithm it should be noted that borg minimizes all objectives objective 1 1 min i 1 m j 1 n c i j s n where c i j denotes the cost of lid type j in subcatchment i the cost being a function of the lid type j the size s and the number of units of that lid in a given subcatchment the cost of each lid type is based on cost functions aggregated into groups objective 2 2 min q p objective 3 3 min t 0 k i 1 n r i t where q p is the maximum flow rate through the point of interest in the stormsewer most downstream point modelled and location of flow monitor used for calibration during the duration of the simulation r i t denotes the runoff from subcatchment i at time t where k is simply the end point of the simulation overall the objective of the optimization process is to find the most effective combinations of lid controls at various cost levels in other words the primary goal of the optimization process is to generate cost benefit curves 3 3 decision variables for this study 24 decision variables were selected the decision variables selected focus on the types of lids selected and also but to a lesser extent the sizing and location of the lids the lids are interdependent in that whichever combinations of lids are present in a given subcatchment influences the percent of the impervious area in each subcatchment that routes runoff to each lid the decision variables are listed in table 2 note that the first decision variable is numbered 0 for consistency with the c programming used where the first member of an array is called with a 0 the placement of lids was optimized by dividing lids into groups based on runoff zones and soil types runoff zones are three groupings that were created based on the runoff coefficient of each subcatchment where lids might be placed note that this is related to the implementation of decision variables and not a division between scenarios this was done based on the results of a test run of the hydrological model without any lid controls runoff group 1 consists of all the subcatchments with runoff coefficients of at least one standard deviation below the mean value group 2 was all the subcatchments within 1 standard deviation from the mean and group 3 subcatchments are at least one standard deviation above the mean runoff group 1 contains 30 subcatchments with a total of 133 houses group 2 contains 172 subcatchments with a total of 624 houses and runoff group 3 contains 40 subcatchments with a total of 99 houses the total number of subcatchments listed is fewer than the total in the model because the subcatchments are not uniform and not all contained suitable locations for the lid controls being considered although there are far more subcatchments and houses in group 2 the number in the other groups should be sufficient to determine if there is for example a cost efficiency benefit to investing in high runoff areas gaining this information is the purpose of dividing the subcatchments into different groups which can be individually optimized the lids were not optimized by individual subcatchments because of the high number of subcatchments included in the model increasing the number of groupings would be one way to increase the focus on the placement of lids the decision variables related to the lid size were constrained within reasonable parameters for the space available and type of lid control 3 4 connecting the models the goal of the optimization is to find the pareto optimal front for the objectives of reducing stormsewer peak flow and total runoff in the study area while also minimizing the cost such a procedure may be represented as the development of cost benefit curves the decision variables are various lid design parameters related to their definition in the swmm input file the fitness functions which evaluate the solutions taking the decision variables and returning objective values are the model itself as well as cost functions this whole system is created by linking the swmm model to the borg algorithm so that there can be a feedback process where borg alters some swmm input parameters and receives outputs from the swmm model swmm essentially serves as a fitness function for the borg algorithm fig 5 demonstrates the essential data flow between swmm and borg 3 5 optimization simulation tests for this study there are a total of 15 different scenarios for which the optimization simulation model was run these scenarios are composed of five different lid implementation scenarios each being tested for three different design storms the three design storms are 5 year 25 year and 100 year return period storms scs type 2 24 h storms were used the total rainfall volumes for each event were obtained from environment canada s intensity duration frequency idf curves for the windsor airport weather station these divisions allow for observations on the usefulness and cost effectiveness of lid stormwater controls at various lid adoption levels as well as observations on how the performance of lid solutions of varying adoption rates perform during storms of various intensities for each scenario 12 500 functional evaluations were completed there are five different lid adoption scenarios they include retrofit low and high lid adoption and new development low high and unrestricted adoption the retrofit scenarios represent the addition of lid stormwater controls to the sewershed as it currently exists the new development scenarios consider the implementation of lid controls in the development of the sewershed the new development scenarios do not represent comprehensive lid designs as they still only supplement the existing style of development a true comprehensive approach to low impact development would include concerns regarding water and ecology throughout the planning process in addition to the lids included in the new development scenarios in this study a more comprehensive approach to lid might also implement shared green spaces which can also assist in stormwater control cluster development to leave more space untouched and take advantage of natural waterways and flow paths the new development scenarios in this study do have the advantage of some reduced construction costs where construction is more efficient as well as increased adoption rates increased adoption rates are possible because a new development can be built to include permeable pavement or infiltration trenches a developer could choose to implement lid strategies or the lid strategies could be mandated for new development e g toronto s green roof policy people are also more likely to use a rain barrel or rain garden if it can come installed in their home and they do not have to expend any effort to implement them table 3 lists the maximum lid adoption percentages used for the five lid implementation scenarios the adoption rates are selected in order to be close to what might be achieved in reality while also being able to study the benefit of lids at various adoption rates adoption rates as low as 1 were not used because this would mean that changes to decision variables would result in very minute feedback from the simulation model the unrestricted scenario was included in order to study the maximum benefit lids could achieve 4 results and discussion the optimization simulation model was able to produce cost benefit curves for the implementation of lids in the study area as well as generate useful information on optimizing lid design in low infiltration areas the performance of lids was evaluated for all three design storms for each of the five lid implementation scenarios the graphs shown in figs 6 9 were created to only show the non dominated solutions in each of the two reduction objectives and cost i e the results were filtered rather than displaying the entire pareto optimal front in three dimensions note that the cost values presented are the estimates for the capital costs associated with the construction of the lid stormwater controls design engineering maintenance and land acquisition costs are not considered table 4 provides a summary of the maximum reductions of peak flow and total runoff possible in each scenario note that the maximum peak flow reduction and maximum runoff reduction are not always achieved in the same solution lid configuration tables 5 and 6 show some of the most cost effective solutions from each scenario and tables 8 and 9 show the decision variables number and sizes of lids corresponding to those solutions low impact development is not commonly designed for extreme precipitation events however the results demonstrate that lid controls can still offer significant reductions to both peak flow and total runoff even so the lids performed poorly on a cost benefit basis the retrofit and new development low lid adoption scenarios were not able to achieve large reductions and the larger reductions seen in the new development high lid adoption and the unrestricted scenarios came at significant cost one common thread across all lid adoption scenarios is that the reduction percentages decreased during the 100 year return period event the following sections present the results of each scenario in greater depth 4 1 cost benefit curves 4 1 1 retrofit solutions in the low adoption scenario the overall reduction capacity is very low for both peak flow reduction and total runoff reduction as is the case for every scenario the percentage by which the peak flow can be reduced by lid controls is less than the percentage by which the runoff can be reduced the runoff reductions are severely limited by the poor hydraulic conditions of the soils whereas the storage provided by the lids is still able to alter the flow timings and reduce peak flows the retrofit scenarios feature both low costs and low reductions to both peak flow and total runoff the cost effectiveness reduction per money spent is similar to the other scenarios even with similar cost effectiveness to the other scenarios these results cast doubt on to whether this level of lid retrofitting would be useful for limiting peak flow or runoff for the large precipitation events studied between the low and high retrofit scenarios there is an increase in the cost effectiveness of the peak flow reduction that could be attributed to loosening restrictions on infiltration trenches the number of subcatchments that an infiltration trench may be installed is increased from 5 of feasible subcatchments in the retrofit low adoption scenario to 25 in the retrofit high adoption scenario this increase is greater than the increase for other lid types infiltration trenches are the dominant lid type expressed in the pareto optimal solutions especially for peak flow reduction they achieve this by providing relatively inexpensive storage rain gardens were more effective for runoff reduction because their design included amended soil with a slightly improved infiltration rate fig 6 shows the solutions for each of the design storms filtered such that only the solutions which are non dominated in the objectives of peak flow reduction and cost minimization are included the slope of the series in the graph is not uniform because the jumps in peak flow reduction differ depending on whether the changes are due to changes in the sizing of rain gardens and or infiltration trenches changes in the numbers of a given lid or changes in the combinations of lids present in any solution the diminishing returns in investment occur once the adoption of a better performing lid has been completed and further increases in peak flow reduction can only be achieved by investing in less efficient lids therefore the amount of peak flow reduction that can be achieved before a significant point of diminishing returns is reached depends on the constraints on the adoption of the most efficient lid types in each scenario these insights also serve as examples of the types of the information that can be extracted from the results of a multi objective optimization 4 1 2 new development scenarios the cost benefit curves for the new development are similar to the retrofit scenario in that the reduction percentage for peak flow is significantly better than the reduction percentage for total runoff the maximum percent reduction in peak flow for each storm event also comes at a much lower cost than the maximum runoff percent reduction in total runoff for the same events an important difference from the retrofit scenarios to the new development scenario is a change from simple rain gardens to more complex bioretention units the bioretention units are better for peak flow reduction because they offer more storage space where water can be detained however they perform worse for runoff reduction as they infiltrate less water another change is there is an increase in the maximum possible adoption level for permeable pavement however this is not a significant factor as permeable pavement does not prove to be a cost effective solution in the new development high lid adoption scenario the maximum adoption of some of the lids significantly increases for this scenario permeable pavement driveways can now be placed at all the houses in the sewershed and infiltration trenches can be placed in any subcatchment eligible for lids the result is a large spike in the reduction percentages for both peak flow reduction reduction exceeding 21 is possible and total runoff reduction reduction exceeding 12 is possible this reduction does come at a higher cost but the cost effectiveness is no less than for previously discussed scenarios a relationship between the reduction percentages achieved by the lid controls and the intensity of the design storms persists across each scenario that is as the intensity of the storms increases the reduction percentages decrease this is the case for both peak flow reduction and total runoff reduction although the drop off is greater for peak flow the cost benefit curves in fig 8 shows the peak flow reduction for the 5 year storm for each of the three new development scenarios for peak flow reduction the most efficient solutions are once again dominated by infiltration trenches and the reduction efficiency starts to drop off once other lid types have to be relied upon for additional improvement some of the high performing solutions also include bioretention units for the unrestricted lid adoption scenario a higher peak flow reduction is achieved without a significant reduction in cost effectiveness fig 9 compares the runoff reduction for each of the new development scenarios under the 5 year storm event the design flexibility possible in the unrestricted scenario produces a significant increase in cost effectiveness the cost effectiveness achieved in all the scenarios is quite similar for most of the low cost solutions however the amount of reduction both of peak flow and total runoff that can be achieved in the new development high lid adoption and new development unrestricted lid adoption scenarios is much greater infiltration trenches and bioretention units provide most of that reduction for peak flow and also contribute significantly to runoff reduction when planning a new development both of these lid practices could possibly be incorporated into shared spaces such that they did not require each member of the community to individually adopt them to further demonstrate the results provided by the model and to help understand the design capabilities the peak flow reduction data series for the 5 and 100 year storms are further analyzed with labels applied in fig 10 fig 10 includes solutions which are dominated in the objectives of peak flow reduction and cost minimization so that observations can be made about what causes drop offs in peak flow reduction some of the poor performing solutions in the low cost section of the figure are those that include bioretention units with very small areas bioretention units with small surface areas and which are receiving a large portion of the runoff from impervious surfaces may be overloaded leading to higher flow rates through the underdrains other drops are attributable to when the number or area of infiltration trenches and to a lesser extent bioretention units are reduced while permeable pavement is added these changes might result in an increase in runoff because permeable pavement can be effective at reducing runoff however the changes also lessen peak flow reduction 4 2 secondary data it is apparent that the multiobjective optimization component of the optimization simulation model generates significantly more information than what would be obtained by simply searching for the maximum achievable reductions under constraints or testing specific solutions the production of the cost benefit curves provides insight into lid combinations that can provide relatively high levels of performance for relatively lower cost before higher levels of diminishing returns are observed these more cost effective solutions are presented in tables 5 and 6 patterns in the decision variables some of which have already been discussed can provide insights into effective lid design in the study area the decision variables corresponding to the cost effective solutions are presented in tables 8 and 9 table 7 provides acronyms to help with understanding tables 8 and 9 4 2 1 cost effective solutions the solutions presented in tables 5 and 6 represent a selection of solutions that offer relatively high performance before reaching a point of diminishing returns the solutions presented here are able to achieve a high percentage of the maximum reductions shown in table 4 at a fraction of the cost being able to identify where investment in lids will begin to offer diminishing returns is valuable information to any large scale lid implementation plan 4 2 2 lower intensity storms and hydrographs the most cost effective solutions for peak flow reduction were tested on the calibration series of events the calibration time series contains shorter return period events than the design storms used for the optimization on a percentage reduction basis the lids performed better for the shorter return period events than for the design storms by running specific solutions in swmm further analysis can be conducted for those solutions fig 11 shows the hydrographs for cost effective solutions for each lid scenario the overall volume of flow being conveyed by the storm sewer decreases for each event showing that the lid controls are able to infiltrate a higher proportion of runoff from smaller events 4 2 3 decision variable selection further detail on the lid controls selected for the most cost effective solutions is presented in this section closer examination of the decision variable can provide insight into lid sizing and placement a straightforward example of a common thread between the scenarios is that the lid units are often added to the highest runoff zone zone 3 first and then the middle runoff zone second this could indicate that it is more cost effective to invest in installing lid controls in high runoff areas an additional unsurprisingly result is that the optimal lid area increased for higher return period events an additional observation is that the areas for the infiltration trenches despite their effectiveness are generally far below their maximum allowable areas 5 limitations there are limitations to the simulations which could impact the predicted performance of the lid stormwater controls firstly lids are commonly designed to provide treatment or detention for less intense storms additionally the lid designs in this study are widely generalized resulting in inefficiencies in their design since the subcatchment sizes and properties are not uniform the generalization of lid designs means that a certain type of lid might be designed to be too small for some subcatchments resulting in reduced performance but also over designed for other subcatchments resulting in increased cost the limitations of lid routing in swmm which prevent routing from one lid to another might limit the performance of the lid controls additionally none of the scenarios include a full range of possible lid measures or any combinations with any other stormwater best management practices there are also limitations of the study which could result in an over prediction of lid performance the flow from groundwater into the lids such as could be the case if the water table were high was not simulated however if high water tables were a factor it would be possible to add impervious liners to the lid units to preserve the peak flow reduction benefits finally long term maintenance requirements and related declines in the performance of the lid controls were not included in this study 6 conclusions with increasing urbanization contributing to excessive stormwater runoff there is a need for new techniques such as low impact development to be incorporated into stormwater management systems this study was dedicated to the development of an optimization simulation model which could be used to generate a wealth of information on the identification and placement of low impact development stormwater controls this was achieved by coupling the stormwater management model swmm with borg multiobjective evolutionary algorithm moea swmm is able to evaluate solutions passed to it by borg and return the outputs of simulations to borg so that borg can determine the effectiveness of those solutions solutions consist of the decision variables in the optimization process which can be set to any parameter found in the swmm input file this study evaluated the effectiveness of low impact development measures therefore the decision variables were set to control the implementation of lid controls in the model parsing functions were developed to change all the parameters in the swmm input file necessary to accurately reflect changes being made to lid controls the model was tested for a sewershed with poor infiltration characteristics in windsor ontario canada the optimization simulation model was successfully able to generate useful data on the implementation of lids in the sewershed this data includes cost benefit curves as well as insights on optimal lid combinations sizing and placement this is information that stormwater professionals can use to make informed decisions regarding the planning and implementation of lids for this study we were able to determine that infiltration trenches would be the most cost effective lid of those studied particularly for reducing peak flow additionally it is the most cost effective to focus on implementing lids in high runoff areas first for the sewershed in question lids were able to make significant reductions in both storm sewer peak flow up to 29 and total runoff up to 13 despite the poor infiltration characteristics of the sewershed the reductions in peak flow were achieved by building detention storage into the catchments with lids with that being said even the more cost effective solutions may not be competitive with other stormwater best management practices or grey infrastructure for the stated objectives under the conditions modelled for the study area however if other benefits of lids such as water quality treatment were considered the benefits might outweigh the cost furthermore the results show that if lids are implemented specifically for the purpose of water quality treatment it is important for the designer to also consider the benefit they might add in terms of reducing peak flow or total runoff

7242,green infrastructure such as low impact development lid controls are being employed to manage the urban stormwater and restore the predevelopment hydrological conditions besides improving the stormwater runoff water quality since runoff generation and infiltration processes are nonlinear there is a need for identifying optimal combination of lid controls a coupled optimization simulation model was developed by linking the u s epa stormwater management model swmm to the borg multiobjective evolutionary algorithm borg moea the coupled model is capable of performing multiobjective optimization which uses swmm simulations as a tool to evaluate potential solutions to the optimization problem the optimization simulation tool was used to evaluate low impact development lid stormwater controls a swmm model was developed calibrated and validated for a sewershed in windsor ontario and lid stormwater controls were tested for three different return periods lid implementation strategies were optimized using the optimization simulation model for five different implementation scenarios for each of the three storm events with the objectives of minimizing peak flow in the stormsewers reducing total runoff and minimizing cost for the sewershed in windsor ontario the peak run off and total volume of the runoff were found to reduce by 13 and 29 respectively keywords

hydrological patterns and flow regimes these changes often include increased peak flows reduced times of concentration redistribution of the water balance and flashier flows in urban streams and

stormwater runoff jennings et al 2012 mcgrane 2016 ecosystem damage and property damage from flooding often end up exceeding the cost of stormwater management visitacion et al 2009 rapid urbanization and climate change are expected to further increase the risk of flooding and drainage disasters in urban drainage systems duan et al 2016 stovin et al 2012 visitacion et al 2009 wang et al 2016 one way to combat this is the use of low impact development lid which is an emerging approach to stormwater management that is being utilized to reduce the impacts of urbanization and climate change on urban watersheds some of the commonly used lid controls include rain barrels rain gardens bioretention ponds and porous pavements the philosophy behind the lid approach is to attempt to replicate the hydrology of the pre development watershed lid uses distributed stormwater controls source controls and incorporates natural hydrologic features in order to detain water which in turn facilitates infiltration and evapotranspiration by doing so lid can reduce flooding and improve ecological conditions damodaram et al 2010 shuster et al 2008 van roon 2005 2007 van roon and knight lenihan 2004 lid has often been implemented as a retrofit designed to ease the stress on urban stormwater infrastructure as well as provide some resiliency to the impacts of climate change ahiablame et al 2012 jia et al 2012 liu et al 2015 the detailed investigations on the performance of the individual lid controls were performed for example on permeable pavements brunetti et al 2016 huang et al 2016 and bioretention units hathaway et al 2014 where there are a number of subcatchments within a catchment it can be difficult to determine which lid controls to place in each subcatchment or if any at all cano and barkdoll 2017 the selection and placement of lid controls such as number locations and combinations of controls can be abundant due to varying features the number of possible combinations may not be feasible to analyze particularly at a large scale determining the optimal placement and selection of controls is required to achieve maximum runoff reductions at the minimum costs liu et al 2016 the cost effectiveness of the lids from the point of view of life cycle assessment was investigated by chui et al 2016 and wang et al 2016 two tools that stormwater professionals can utilize to help them implement lid controls are simulation and optimization computer modeling is a powerful tool for the design and optimization of sewer systems ahmed et al 2017 akhter and hewa 2016 freni et al 2010 palanisamy and chui 2015 palla and gnecco 2015 wang et al 2016 xu et al 2017 zahmatkesh et al 2015 several models now include methods for simulating lid controls the most commonly used model for research is the u s environmental protection agency s stormwater management model swmm rossman 2010 to expediently assess and compare lid scenarios in a watershed optimization tools are extremely useful optimization tools have greatly improved and now allow for more accurate and less complex methods most often single objective optimization has been used however single objective optimization requires some objectives to be constrained to a target range or weighted a priori when attempting to optimize multiple objectives without making preference decisions prior to optimization multiobjective optimization is stronger one of the most common sets of multiobjective optimization tools used with lid controls are genetic algorithms genetic or evolutionary algorithms can be used to optimize multiple objectives and are easily linked with simulation models such as swmm baek et al 2015 duan et al 2016 jung et al 2016 karamouz and nazif 2013 and soil and water assessment tool swat kaini et al 2008 neitsch et al 2011 there are several genetic algorithms available to be used in multiobjective optimization and several improvements have been made over time for this study the genetic algorithm of choice is the borg multi objective evolutionary algorithm moea hadka and reed 2013 coupling a multi objective optimization model with swmm is being explored more recently for analyzing lid scenarios duan et al 2016 studied the multi objective optimal design of detention tanks and lid devices they used swmm for the numerical simulation and applied the modified particle swarm optimization npso scheme to solve the multi objective optimization problem baek et al 2015 combined swmm with matlab and used the pattern search algorithm to optimize lid sizes jung et al 2016 developed an optimization model using the harmony search hs algorithm coupled with swmm to determine the optimal design of permeable pavement liu et al 2016 have coupled their own lid simulator l thia lid 2 1 with amalgam an optimization algorithm developed by vrugt and robinson 2007 the ability to optimize multiple objectives is useful for the implementation of lid controls lid implementation allows for optimization in the selection placement and sizing of many lid controls throughout a site or watershed multi objective optimization provides the ability for one to develop multiple trade off solutions an example of this being a cost benefit curve prior to making preference decisions this allows stormwater professionals to present the stakeholders with a range of potential solutions and include their preferences into the design process it can also be utilized when conducting higher level planning exercises such as a drainage master plan in order to evaluate the potential benefits of lid implementation on a sewershed scale without spending significant effort in the design optimizing lids for cost allows one to compare the costs of many potential lid solutions to other stormwater structures and devices for this research a simulation optimization model was developed to generate cost benefit information for the selection of lid controls this study uses swmm borg moea and cost functions in order to examine the potential of lid controls to reduce total runoff over the study area and stormsewer peak flows at various cost levels the optimization simulation model developed is able to conduct multiobjective optimization so that cost benefit curves can be easily generated the model allows users to analyze the significance of various design parameters for lid controls 2 site description a sewershed in windsor ontario canada was used as a study area to develop and test the optimization simulation model the sewershed in question is a 77 ha residentially zoned suburban sewershed excluding undeveloped areas the study area is 49 5 covered by impervious surfaces with slopes generally less than 1 the distance from the location of the flow monitor in the sewershed to the nearest rain gauge is about 1 2 km the sewershed possesses characteristics which could make it poorly suited to lid implementation including primarily hydrological group d soils clay and clay loam with only a small portion underlain by type c sand the seasonally high water table is estimated to rise to a depth of about 1 m the sewershed primarily utilizes curb and channel drainage and is served by a stormsewer system which congregates at the flow monitor depicted in fig 2 before flowing into a trunk sewer 3 methodology an optimization simulation method was developed for the purpose of finding optimal strategies for the deployment of lid stormwater controls this type of model can provide stormwater practitioners with clearer design choices without having to make preference decisions a priori deb 2001 fig 2 depicts the layout of the system that was constructed as well as the data requirements in this optimization simulation methodology the simulation model swmm is used as a fitness function for the borg moea the optimization algorithm with the other fitness function being the cost functions that were developed for this study the components depicted in fig 2 are explained in greater detail in the following sections 3 1 hydrological modeling 3 1 1 model setup this study employs swmm version 5 1 to simulate urban hydrological processes with the study area and the effects of adding lid controls swmm has been an effective tool for modeling urban drainage networks and the recent versions include an lid toolbox for the simulation of a number of lid controls swmm has previously been used to study low impact development including those studies previously mentioned damodaram and zechman 2013 karamouz and nazif 2013 oraei zare et al 2012 zhang 2009 as well as some others bosley 2008 damodaram et al 2010 elliott and trowsdale 2007 maharjan et al 2009 mcgarity 2010 palanisamy and chui 2015 palla and gnecco 2015 qin et al 2013 rosa et al 2015 zahmatkesh et al 2015 the study area was divided into 292 non uniform subcatchments the subcatchment properties were determined through gis data satellite imagery and site inspection the network of links and nodes was created based on sewer maps obtained from the city of windsor swmm allows the option of choosing either green ampt method horton s method or the scs curve number cn method for determining infiltration the cn method was developed to calculate the runoff and eventually infiltration volumes in small urban watersheds which is the focus of this study this method was selected to compute infiltration losses because it has been previously used in studies focused on the optimization of an urban stormwater system maharjan et al 2009 and optimization simulation of lid controls using swmm zhang 2009 the cn method was used because of its basis on a single parameter and responsiveness to the runoff producing characteristics of urban watersheds both of these were listed as strengths of the method by ponce and hawkins 1996 the dynamic wave method was selected as the routing method because of its ability to account for channel storage backwater effects entrance exit losses flow reversal and pressurized flow rossman 2010 the main parameters for subcatchments are area percent impervious area width slope infiltration parameters manning s roughness coefficients for overland flow for pervious and impervious surfaces depression storage depth for pervious and impervious surfaces percent zero and internal routing parameters the percent impervious area and slope were determined using google earth the width was set as the distance from the back of the subcatchment to the street as suggested in gironás et al 2009 and then altered during the calibration process the function of the width is essentially to determine the overland flow distance which runoff must travel before becoming channelized the infiltration parameters mainly the curve number manning s roughness coefficients and storage depths were determined based on the sewershed characteristics mentioned in section 2 and the tables in the appendices of the swmm manual rossman 2010 these values were later calibrated the internal routing parameters describe if runoff from impervious areas is routed to pervious areas before the subcatchment outlet and if so what percentage of the runoff from impervious area is these were set largely based on inspection of the sewershed primarily to where downspouts were routing roof water the percent zero is the percent of the impervious area on which there is no surface storage primarily roofs this value was calibrated to 30 which lies in the typical range reported in zhang 2009 there are a few additional input parameters the evaporation was set to only occur during dry periods and was based on the monthly pan evaporation because these evaporation rates were used and snowmelt is not considered there is no need for a climate file with temperatures the equation selected for force main was the darcy weisbach equation the start and end times were selected to include the entire precipitation events and some time before and after where there is no precipitation as for the time controls the reporting interval was set to 5 min the wet calculation time step was set to 20 s while the dry step was set to 40 s the routing time step was set to 3 s because a very short time step is required for dynamic wave routing with these parameters the calculation error was consistently very low 3 1 2 calibration and validation flow data collected from a flow monitor position displayed in fig 1 and precipitation time series were used to calibrate the swmm model the precipitation time series used was the mean reading of the three rain gauges that surround the study area previous studies have used manning s roughness coefficient depression storage depth infiltration parameters e g curve number subcatchment width subcatchments percent imperviousness subcatchment slope percentage of impervious surfaces with no depression storage and channel roughness values as calibration parameters bosley 2008 liong et al 1991 warwick and tadepalli 1991 zhang 2009 to calibrate the model adjustments were made to the subcatchments imperviousness widths curve numbers and the percentage of the impervious surfaces with no depression storage in order to represent the hydrological processes in a realistic manner the model was simulated on a continuous time scale however we do not know the initial soil moisture conditions in the sewershed therefore starting the simulation somewhat earlier than the period over which calibration is performed we will be able to overcome any potential uncertainties in the initial conditions some of the hydrological simulation models refer this to warmup period which helps in establishing the starting conditions better two series of continuous simulations each containing multiple precipitation events were used for calibration and validation rainfall and flow monitoring data were provided by the city of windsor though precipitation data were available from october 10th 2012 to january 15th 2014 the selection of events was limited by the time period in which the flow monitor data was available reliable flow monitor data were only available from july 11th 2013 to mid november of the same year from this dataset two subsets of events one each for calibration and validation needed to be chosen while the flow data from any time interval could have been used the data collected between july 15 and july 24 2013 was arbitrarily chosen for calibration and the flow data collected between august 26 and august 31 2013 were used for validation a subset of events refer to the events that occurred in close proximity to each other and were simulated as one continuous simulation so that the model could be tested against consecutive series of events where initial saturation conditions would be changing the ability of the model to reproduce the observed results was numerically evaluated by calculating the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse for each series of events the nse values for calibration and validation were 0 79 and 0 93 respectively the results in terms of time series of flows are displayed in figs 3 and 4 3 1 3 lid controls swmm 5 includes an lid toolbox which allows lid measures to be implemented in the model making the evaluation of these controls much easier the lid toolbox includes the ability to define rain gardens bioretention cells infiltration trenches green roofs permeable pavements rain barrels and vegetative swales the lids are represented in the swmm model through the parameterization of several layers though not all lids have all the layers the creation of treatment trains can be done by creating subcatchments simply for a single lid controls and then route these subcatchments to each other five lid controls were deemed appropriate for use in the study area or a similar residential neighbourhood were selected for this study they include rain barrels porous pavement bioretention both engineered bioretention and simple rain gardens and infiltration trenches depending on the lid control selected parameters of the design were optimized within reasonable ranges while the other required swmm parameters were set based on lid design standards and study area characteristics such as land use available area soil infiltration characteristics slopes and depth to the water table the design guidelines and parameters for the lid controls were obtained from center for watershed protection 2010 cvc 2010 ontario moe 2003 rossman 2010 woods ballard et al 2007 the sources and unit costs used to calculate the capital costs of lid implementation were obtained through vendors the city of windsor and developers the subcatchment routing to lids was determined based on which lids were present in a given subcatchment the routing schemes can be seen in table 1 lid properties were optimized as decision variables the details of which are discussed in section 3 3 3 2 optimization multi objective optimization refers to the maximizing or more often the minimizing of multiple objectives f x f1 x f2 x fn x where x x1 x2 xn represent the decision variables the decision variables define the decision space where the feasible region is the set of solutions in the space which satisfy any constraints placed on the decision variables deb 2001 a single solution is a set of n values corresponding to a feasible value for each decision variable for example for the design and placement of rain barrels the decision variables might be the number of rain barrels per house constrained between 0 and 4 and the size of the rain barrels constrained to one of the commonly available sizes on the market the optimization goal for this study was to find the pareto optimal front for the objectives of minimizing peak flow in the stormsewers total stormwater runoff and cost such a procedure may be represented as the development of cost benefit curves the decision variables are various lid design parameters related to their definition in the swmm input file the fitness functions which evaluate the solutions taking the decision variables and returning objective values are the swmm model itself as well as cost functions this whole system is created by linking the swmm model to the borg moea so that there can be a feedback process where borg alters some swmm input parameters and receives outputs from the swmm model borg moea is an advanced genetic algorithm ga one unique benefit of gas is their ability to find multiple optimal solutions in a single run deb 2001 furthermore gas allow for a more evenly distributed pareto optimal set than what we may get by running several runs of a single optimization problem and altering the weights a priori deb 2001 gas are very adaptable and can be applied to a wide variety of problem types and scales sivanandam 2007 the fitness functions used are also very adaptable for example a fitness function might be a simple mathematical formula which uses the decision variable values to produce objective function values or it could be a hydrological model which uses the decision variables as some of its input parameters and produces outputs which are used as objective values one thing that can make it easier to use a ga is that they require no prior knowledge of the objective space sivanandam 2007 one final benefit of gas relevant to this study is that they are specifically designed to discover pareto optimal fronts sivanandam 2007 3 2 1 borg moea there are several genetic algorithms available to be used in multiobjective optimization and several improvements have been made over time for this study the genetic algorithm of choice is the borg multi objective evolutionary algorithm moea hadka and reed 2013 borg moea combines and enhances several processes used successfully in previous gas it has been used for water resource problems for example d ervau 2013 however it has not yet been widely used as it is still new tested against six state of the art moeas on several test problems borg met or exceeded the performance of the other moeas on most of the tests hadka and reed 2012 a complete description of the borg moea and important components can be found in hadka and reed 2013 borg is freely available for research purposes from borgmoea org borg moea is an elitist genetic algorithm meaning that in addition to the population borg also stores an elite archive of solutions the elite archive has more stringent dominance criteria than the population it is maintained throughout a run of borg and output product and the conclusion of the run a new solution is added to the population if it dominates at least one member of the population the dominated member of the population is replaced and if more than one member of the population is dominated by the new solution then one of the dominated solutions is removed at random hadka and reed 2013 3 2 2 objectives there are many possible combinations of low impact development controls which might be implemented in an urban or sub urban area but the primary objective of the optimization process is to find combinations of lids that will optimally reduce sewershed wide runoff and peak flow in the stormsewers while reducing the cost when implementing stormwater controls it is ideal to get the maximum performance reduction at the lowest cost equations 1 2 and 3 represent the three objectives for optimization by the borg algorithm it should be noted that borg minimizes all objectives objective 1 1 min i 1 m j 1 n c i j s n where c i j denotes the cost of lid type j in subcatchment i the cost being a function of the lid type j the size s and the number of units of that lid in a given subcatchment the cost of each lid type is based on cost functions aggregated into groups objective 2 2 min q p objective 3 3 min t 0 k i 1 n r i t where q p is the maximum flow rate through the point of interest in the stormsewer most downstream point modelled and location of flow monitor used for calibration during the duration of the simulation r i t denotes the runoff from subcatchment i at time t where k is simply the end point of the simulation overall the objective of the optimization process is to find the most effective combinations of lid controls at various cost levels in other words the primary goal of the optimization process is to generate cost benefit curves 3 3 decision variables for this study 24 decision variables were selected the decision variables selected focus on the types of lids selected and also but to a lesser extent the sizing and location of the lids the lids are interdependent in that whichever combinations of lids are present in a given subcatchment influences the percent of the impervious area in each subcatchment that routes runoff to each lid the decision variables are listed in table 2 note that the first decision variable is numbered 0 for consistency with the c programming used where the first member of an array is called with a 0 the placement of lids was optimized by dividing lids into groups based on runoff zones and soil types runoff zones are three groupings that were created based on the runoff coefficient of each subcatchment where lids might be placed note that this is related to the implementation of decision variables and not a division between scenarios this was done based on the results of a test run of the hydrological model without any lid controls runoff group 1 consists of all the subcatchments with runoff coefficients of at least one standard deviation below the mean value group 2 was all the subcatchments within 1 standard deviation from the mean and group 3 subcatchments are at least one standard deviation above the mean runoff group 1 contains 30 subcatchments with a total of 133 houses group 2 contains 172 subcatchments with a total of 624 houses and runoff group 3 contains 40 subcatchments with a total of 99 houses the total number of subcatchments listed is fewer than the total in the model because the subcatchments are not uniform and not all contained suitable locations for the lid controls being considered although there are far more subcatchments and houses in group 2 the number in the other groups should be sufficient to determine if there is for example a cost efficiency benefit to investing in high runoff areas gaining this information is the purpose of dividing the subcatchments into different groups which can be individually optimized the lids were not optimized by individual subcatchments because of the high number of subcatchments included in the model increasing the number of groupings would be one way to increase the focus on the placement of lids the decision variables related to the lid size were constrained within reasonable parameters for the space available and type of lid control 3 4 connecting the models the goal of the optimization is to find the pareto optimal front for the objectives of reducing stormsewer peak flow and total runoff in the study area while also minimizing the cost such a procedure may be represented as the development of cost benefit curves the decision variables are various lid design parameters related to their definition in the swmm input file the fitness functions which evaluate the solutions taking the decision variables and returning objective values are the model itself as well as cost functions this whole system is created by linking the swmm model to the borg algorithm so that there can be a feedback process where borg alters some swmm input parameters and receives outputs from the swmm model swmm essentially serves as a fitness function for the borg algorithm fig 5 demonstrates the essential data flow between swmm and borg 3 5 optimization simulation tests for this study there are a total of 15 different scenarios for which the optimization simulation model was run these scenarios are composed of five different lid implementation scenarios each being tested for three different design storms the three design storms are 5 year 25 year and 100 year return period storms scs type 2 24 h storms were used the total rainfall volumes for each event were obtained from environment canada s intensity duration frequency idf curves for the windsor airport weather station these divisions allow for observations on the usefulness and cost effectiveness of lid stormwater controls at various lid adoption levels as well as observations on how the performance of lid solutions of varying adoption rates perform during storms of various intensities for each scenario 12 500 functional evaluations were completed there are five different lid adoption scenarios they include retrofit low and high lid adoption and new development low high and unrestricted adoption the retrofit scenarios represent the addition of lid stormwater controls to the sewershed as it currently exists the new development scenarios consider the implementation of lid controls in the development of the sewershed the new development scenarios do not represent comprehensive lid designs as they still only supplement the existing style of development a true comprehensive approach to low impact development would include concerns regarding water and ecology throughout the planning process in addition to the lids included in the new development scenarios in this study a more comprehensive approach to lid might also implement shared green spaces which can also assist in stormwater control cluster development to leave more space untouched and take advantage of natural waterways and flow paths the new development scenarios in this study do have the advantage of some reduced construction costs where construction is more efficient as well as increased adoption rates increased adoption rates are possible because a new development can be built to include permeable pavement or infiltration trenches a developer could choose to implement lid strategies or the lid strategies could be mandated for new development e g toronto s green roof policy people are also more likely to use a rain barrel or rain garden if it can come installed in their home and they do not have to expend any effort to implement them table 3 lists the maximum lid adoption percentages used for the five lid implementation scenarios the adoption rates are selected in order to be close to what might be achieved in reality while also being able to study the benefit of lids at various adoption rates adoption rates as low as 1 were not used because this would mean that changes to decision variables would result in very minute feedback from the simulation model the unrestricted scenario was included in order to study the maximum benefit lids could achieve 4 results and discussion the optimization simulation model was able to produce cost benefit curves for the implementation of lids in the study area as well as generate useful information on optimizing lid design in low infiltration areas the performance of lids was evaluated for all three design storms for each of the five lid implementation scenarios the graphs shown in figs 6 9 were created to only show the non dominated solutions in each of the two reduction objectives and cost i e the results were filtered rather than displaying the entire pareto optimal front in three dimensions note that the cost values presented are the estimates for the capital costs associated with the construction of the lid stormwater controls design engineering maintenance and land acquisition costs are not considered table 4 provides a summary of the maximum reductions of peak flow and total runoff possible in each scenario note that the maximum peak flow reduction and maximum runoff reduction are not always achieved in the same solution lid configuration tables 5 and 6 show some of the most cost effective solutions from each scenario and tables 8 and 9 show the decision variables number and sizes of lids corresponding to those solutions low impact development is not commonly designed for extreme precipitation events however the results demonstrate that lid controls can still offer significant reductions to both peak flow and total runoff even so the lids performed poorly on a cost benefit basis the retrofit and new development low lid adoption scenarios were not able to achieve large reductions and the larger reductions seen in the new development high lid adoption and the unrestricted scenarios came at significant cost one common thread across all lid adoption scenarios is that the reduction percentages decreased during the 100 year return period event the following sections present the results of each scenario in greater depth 4 1 cost benefit curves 4 1 1 retrofit solutions in the low adoption scenario the overall reduction capacity is very low for both peak flow reduction and total runoff reduction as is the case for every scenario the percentage by which the peak flow can be reduced by lid controls is less than the percentage by which the runoff can be reduced the runoff reductions are severely limited by the poor hydraulic conditions of the soils whereas the storage provided by the lids is still able to alter the flow timings and reduce peak flows the retrofit scenarios feature both low costs and low reductions to both peak flow and total runoff the cost effectiveness reduction per money spent is similar to the other scenarios even with similar cost effectiveness to the other scenarios these results cast doubt on to whether this level of lid retrofitting would be useful for limiting peak flow or runoff for the large precipitation events studied between the low and high retrofit scenarios there is an increase in the cost effectiveness of the peak flow reduction that could be attributed to loosening restrictions on infiltration trenches the number of subcatchments that an infiltration trench may be installed is increased from 5 of feasible subcatchments in the retrofit low adoption scenario to 25 in the retrofit high adoption scenario this increase is greater than the increase for other lid types infiltration trenches are the dominant lid type expressed in the pareto optimal solutions especially for peak flow reduction they achieve this by providing relatively inexpensive storage rain gardens were more effective for runoff reduction because their design included amended soil with a slightly improved infiltration rate fig 6 shows the solutions for each of the design storms filtered such that only the solutions which are non dominated in the objectives of peak flow reduction and cost minimization are included the slope of the series in the graph is not uniform because the jumps in peak flow reduction differ depending on whether the changes are due to changes in the sizing of rain gardens and or infiltration trenches changes in the numbers of a given lid or changes in the combinations of lids present in any solution the diminishing returns in investment occur once the adoption of a better performing lid has been completed and further increases in peak flow reduction can only be achieved by investing in less efficient lids therefore the amount of peak flow reduction that can be achieved before a significant point of diminishing returns is reached depends on the constraints on the adoption of the most efficient lid types in each scenario these insights also serve as examples of the types of the information that can be extracted from the results of a multi objective optimization 4 1 2 new development scenarios the cost benefit curves for the new development are similar to the retrofit scenario in that the reduction percentage for peak flow is significantly better than the reduction percentage for total runoff the maximum percent reduction in peak flow for each storm event also comes at a much lower cost than the maximum runoff percent reduction in total runoff for the same events an important difference from the retrofit scenarios to the new development scenario is a change from simple rain gardens to more complex bioretention units the bioretention units are better for peak flow reduction because they offer more storage space where water can be detained however they perform worse for runoff reduction as they infiltrate less water another change is there is an increase in the maximum possible adoption level for permeable pavement however this is not a significant factor as permeable pavement does not prove to be a cost effective solution in the new development high lid adoption scenario the maximum adoption of some of the lids significantly increases for this scenario permeable pavement driveways can now be placed at all the houses in the sewershed and infiltration trenches can be placed in any subcatchment eligible for lids the result is a large spike in the reduction percentages for both peak flow reduction reduction exceeding 21 is possible and total runoff reduction reduction exceeding 12 is possible this reduction does come at a higher cost but the cost effectiveness is no less than for previously discussed scenarios a relationship between the reduction percentages achieved by the lid controls and the intensity of the design storms persists across each scenario that is as the intensity of the storms increases the reduction percentages decrease this is the case for both peak flow reduction and total runoff reduction although the drop off is greater for peak flow the cost benefit curves in fig 8 shows the peak flow reduction for the 5 year storm for each of the three new development scenarios for peak flow reduction the most efficient solutions are once again dominated by infiltration trenches and the reduction efficiency starts to drop off once other lid types have to be relied upon for additional improvement some of the high performing solutions also include bioretention units for the unrestricted lid adoption scenario a higher peak flow reduction is achieved without a significant reduction in cost effectiveness fig 9 compares the runoff reduction for each of the new development scenarios under the 5 year storm event the design flexibility possible in the unrestricted scenario produces a significant increase in cost effectiveness the cost effectiveness achieved in all the scenarios is quite similar for most of the low cost solutions however the amount of reduction both of peak flow and total runoff that can be achieved in the new development high lid adoption and new development unrestricted lid adoption scenarios is much greater infiltration trenches and bioretention units provide most of that reduction for peak flow and also contribute significantly to runoff reduction when planning a new development both of these lid practices could possibly be incorporated into shared spaces such that they did not require each member of the community to individually adopt them to further demonstrate the results provided by the model and to help understand the design capabilities the peak flow reduction data series for the 5 and 100 year storms are further analyzed with labels applied in fig 10 fig 10 includes solutions which are dominated in the objectives of peak flow reduction and cost minimization so that observations can be made about what causes drop offs in peak flow reduction some of the poor performing solutions in the low cost section of the figure are those that include bioretention units with very small areas bioretention units with small surface areas and which are receiving a large portion of the runoff from impervious surfaces may be overloaded leading to higher flow rates through the underdrains other drops are attributable to when the number or area of infiltration trenches and to a lesser extent bioretention units are reduced while permeable pavement is added these changes might result in an increase in runoff because permeable pavement can be effective at reducing runoff however the changes also lessen peak flow reduction 4 2 secondary data it is apparent that the multiobjective optimization component of the optimization simulation model generates significantly more information than what would be obtained by simply searching for the maximum achievable reductions under constraints or testing specific solutions the production of the cost benefit curves provides insight into lid combinations that can provide relatively high levels of performance for relatively lower cost before higher levels of diminishing returns are observed these more cost effective solutions are presented in tables 5 and 6 patterns in the decision variables some of which have already been discussed can provide insights into effective lid design in the study area the decision variables corresponding to the cost effective solutions are presented in tables 8 and 9 table 7 provides acronyms to help with understanding tables 8 and 9 4 2 1 cost effective solutions the solutions presented in tables 5 and 6 represent a selection of solutions that offer relatively high performance before reaching a point of diminishing returns the solutions presented here are able to achieve a high percentage of the maximum reductions shown in table 4 at a fraction of the cost being able to identify where investment in lids will begin to offer diminishing returns is valuable information to any large scale lid implementation plan 4 2 2 lower intensity storms and hydrographs the most cost effective solutions for peak flow reduction were tested on the calibration series of events the calibration time series contains shorter return period events than the design storms used for the optimization on a percentage reduction basis the lids performed better for the shorter return period events than for the design storms by running specific solutions in swmm further analysis can be conducted for those solutions fig 11 shows the hydrographs for cost effective solutions for each lid scenario the overall volume of flow being conveyed by the storm sewer decreases for each event showing that the lid controls are able to infiltrate a higher proportion of runoff from smaller events 4 2 3 decision variable selection further detail on the lid controls selected for the most cost effective solutions is presented in this section closer examination of the decision variable can provide insight into lid sizing and placement a straightforward example of a common thread between the scenarios is that the lid units are often added to the highest runoff zone zone 3 first and then the middle runoff zone second this could indicate that it is more cost effective to invest in installing lid controls in high runoff areas an additional unsurprisingly result is that the optimal lid area increased for higher return period events an additional observation is that the areas for the infiltration trenches despite their effectiveness are generally far below their maximum allowable areas 5 limitations there are limitations to the simulations which could impact the predicted performance of the lid stormwater controls firstly lids are commonly designed to provide treatment or detention for less intense storms additionally the lid designs in this study are widely generalized resulting in inefficiencies in their design since the subcatchment sizes and properties are not uniform the generalization of lid designs means that a certain type of lid might be designed to be too small for some subcatchments resulting in reduced performance but also over designed for other subcatchments resulting in increased cost the limitations of lid routing in swmm which prevent routing from one lid to another might limit the performance of the lid controls additionally none of the scenarios include a full range of possible lid measures or any combinations with any other stormwater best management practices there are also limitations of the study which could result in an over prediction of lid performance the flow from groundwater into the lids such as could be the case if the water table were high was not simulated however if high water tables were a factor it would be possible to add impervious liners to the lid units to preserve the peak flow reduction benefits finally long term maintenance requirements and related declines in the performance of the lid controls were not included in this study 6 conclusions with increasing urbanization contributing to excessive stormwater runoff there is a need for new techniques such as low impact development to be incorporated into stormwater management systems this study was dedicated to the development of an optimization simulation model which could be used to generate a wealth of information on the identification and placement of low impact development stormwater controls this was achieved by coupling the stormwater management model swmm with borg multiobjective evolutionary algorithm moea swmm is able to evaluate solutions passed to it by borg and return the outputs of simulations to borg so that borg can determine the effectiveness of those solutions solutions consist of the decision variables in the optimization process which can be set to any parameter found in the swmm input file this study evaluated the effectiveness of low impact development measures therefore the decision variables were set to control the implementation of lid controls in the model parsing functions were developed to change all the parameters in the swmm input file necessary to accurately reflect changes being made to lid controls the model was tested for a sewershed with poor infiltration characteristics in windsor ontario canada the optimization simulation model was successfully able to generate useful data on the implementation of lids in the sewershed this data includes cost benefit curves as well as insights on optimal lid combinations sizing and placement this is information that stormwater professionals can use to make informed decisions regarding the planning and implementation of lids for this study we were able to determine that infiltration trenches would be the most cost effective lid of those studied particularly for reducing peak flow additionally it is the most cost effective to focus on implementing lids in high runoff areas first for the sewershed in question lids were able to make significant reductions in both storm sewer peak flow up to 29 and total runoff up to 13 despite the poor infiltration characteristics of the sewershed the reductions in peak flow were achieved by building detention storage into the catchments with lids with that being said even the more cost effective solutions may not be competitive with other stormwater best management practices or grey infrastructure for the stated objectives under the conditions modelled for the study area however if other benefits of lids such as water quality treatment were considered the benefits might outweigh the cost furthermore the results show that if lids are implemented specifically for the purpose of water quality treatment it is important for the designer to also consider the benefit they might add in terms of reducing peak flow or total runoff

7243,targeting nonpoint source nps pollution hot spots is of vital importance for placement of best management practices bmps although physically based watershed models have been widely used to estimate nutrient emissions connections between nutrient abatement and compliance of water quality standards have been rarely considered in nps hotspot ranking which may lead to ineffective decision making it s critical to develop a strategy to identify priority management areas pmas based on water quality response to nutrient load mitigation a water quality constrained pma identification framework was thereby proposed in this study based on the simulation optimization approach with ideal load reduction ilr so it integrates the physically based soil and water assessment tool swat model and an optimization model under constraints of site specific water quality standards to our knowledge it was the first effort to identify pmas with simulation based optimization the swat model was established to simulate temporal and spatial nutrient loading and evaluate effectiveness of pollution mitigation a metamodel was trained to establish a quantitative relationship between sources and water quality ranking of priority areas is based on required nutrient load reduction in each sub watershed targeting to satisfy water quality standards in waterbodies which was calculated with genetic algorithm ga the proposed approach was used for identification of pmas on the basis of diffuse total phosphorus tp in lake dianchi watershed one of the three most eutrophic large lakes in china the modeling results demonstrated that 85 of diffuse tp came from 30 of the watershed area compared with the two conventional targeting strategies based on overland nutrient loss and instream nutrient loading the ilr so model identified distinct pmas and narrowed down the coverage of management areas this study addressed the urgent need to incorporate water quality response into pma identification

deterioration and eutrophication in waterbodies across the world conley et al 2009 since significant achievement has been made to deal with point source pollution in recent years excess nps nutrient loss has increasingly become a threat for water quality improvement and aquatic ecosystem restoration sharpley and wang 2014 the nps pollution presents significant spatial heterogeneity due to diverse soil types topographical properties climatic conditions and human activities which is difficult to identify and control schoumans et al 2014 xu et al 2016 to improve water quality affected by excess nps nutrient loss best management practices bmps are effective and widely implemented to control transport and delivery of nutrients to waterbodies chaubey et al 2010 laik et al 2014 for large scale watersheds it s costly and technically difficult to implement bmps throughout the watersheds spatial heterogeneity of nps should be recognized as an important consideration for bmp placement at the watershed scale it s reported that some sub watersheds contribute significantly more nutrient loads than others schilling and wolter 2009 strauss et al 2007 white et al 2009 confining bmps to high polluted areas is usually more cost effective than implementing universal controls or random placement giri et al 2012 strauss et al 2007 consequently identification of vulnerable areas that pose greater risk of nps pollution is crucial for more practical and efficient management strategies taking into account both time and financial resource constraints the concept of critical source areas csas has thereby been widely adopted for cost effective watershed management decision making which are defined as relatively small portions of watersheds contributing a large quantity of pollutant loads to nearby water bodies renkenberger et al 2016 wei et al 2017 identification of csas can be conducted through field monitoring or numerical model simulation sharpley et al 2002 field specific measurement of pollutant loads at the watershed scale is time consuming and expensive which can only represent the local characteristics giri et al 2012 the physically based watershed models are effective tools to support csa identification by tracking the complicated hydrologic soil erosion plant growing and nutrient transport processes and estimating nutrient spatial distributions based on monitored discharges and nutrient concentrations baginska et al 2003 niraula et al 2013 yang et al 2016 improvement in watershed modelling and targeting approaches in recent decades has enabled reliable identifications of csas niraula et al 2013 analyzed the effect of model choice on identification of csas hughes et al 2005 used multi criteria analysis considering factors that influence overall potential for nutrient loss shen et al 2015 presented a stepwise approach to identify csas based on specific uses of particular water bodies defined as water functional zones huang et al 2015 identified csas based on the relationship between precipitation and nutrient yields which could provide a better coverage through accommodating spatial precipitation characteristics in previous studies targeting csas with watershed simulation models is usually based on the total source pollutant loads from land units loads per unit area index luai giri et al 2012 levi et al 2018 however luai overlooks pollutant transport and transformation processes in channels and thus could not represent distinct water quality responses to spatially diverse nutrient abatement which is of vital importance to guide bmp placement although the impacts of nps pollution on water quality have triggered worldwide attention wall et al 2011 responses of rivers and lakes to nutrient load abatement have been rarely incorporated in targeting csas sharpley et al 2003 stated that targeting csas should explicitly demonstrate that a these areas are the main sources of pollution and b implementing mitigation practices at these areas will significantly reduce pollutant concentration in receiving waterbodies hydrological connectivity between overland pollution sources and waterbodies has received limited attention yu et al 2015 thomas et al 2016 only some preliminary attempts have been made to weight land units according to their distance to the water bodies johnes and heathwaite 1997 lane et al 2009 superior to the distance index physically based models are able to serve as more sophisticated and reliable tools by representing complicated channel transport processes some studies targeted csas based on total pollutant loads across the river segments load impact index lii tuppad and srinivasan 2008 giri et al 2014 the lii incorporates contributions of the entire upstream areas it cannot eliminate impacts of the pollutant loads from the upstream and consequently the downstream areas have a great chance to be identified as csas if the upstream areas are seriously polluted the csas identified with the luai and lii methods focus on seriously polluted overland areas and river segments respectively however the ultimate management goal is to improve water quality in receiving waterbodies in this regard the csas identified based on current pollutant loading might not provide sufficient support to guide bmp implementation without connecting nutrient abatement with site specific water quality goal compliance that might result in inefficient bmp placement or failing to reach the water quality targets there is a critical need for providing deep insights into water quality response to pollution mitigation which has been rarely considered when targeting csas to overcome the limitations of the conventional methods for csas identification we developed a water quality constrained targeting framework the concept of priority management areas pmas is adopted chen et al 2014 heck et al 2017 instead of merely focusing on pollutant loading pmas are defined as the areas where diffuse pollution mitigation can achieve relatively better water quality improvement in the present study pmas represent the areas with a high priority for bmp implementation a simulation optimization approach based on ideal load reduction ilr so was developed to identify pmas integrating an optimization model with the physically based soil and water assessment tool swat watershed model in this study ideal load reduction ilr was defined as the required nutrient load abatement in each land unit to meet site specific water quality standards in particular waterbodies the swat model was used to simulate nutrient fate and transport at the watershed scale including both overland and instream processes a levenberge marquardt back propagation lmbp network was established to quantify water quality response to nutrient load reduction the ilr was calculated with an optimization model incorporating constraints of water quality standards the optimization approach has been widely used for optimal decision making in nutrient load allocation or abatement estimation destouni et al 2006 gren and destouni 2012 zhang et al 2017 however simulation based optimization to the best of our knowledge has not been used for csa pma ranking the ilr so approach has advantages over the luai and lii methods as it integrates nps pollution with water quality goal compliance and in the meanwhile mitigates interference of the upstream areas the main objectives of this study are to a establish the connections between nutrient load abatement and compliance of site specific water quality standards and b prioritize areas to implement bmps for nps pollution mitigation with the new ilr criterion the ilr so was used to identify pmas in the lake dianchi watershed which incorporates multiple tributaries with distinct water uses and water quality standards the detailed modelling procedure and results are presented in the following sections 2 material and methodology 2 1 study area

the three most eutrophic shallow large lakes in china the watershed 102 29 103 01 e and 24 29 25 28 n covers a drainage area of 2920 km2 the main tributaries fig 1 draining into lake dianchi include the panlong pl river baoxiang bx river and luolong ll river etc the panlong river with a length of 108 km and drainage area of 847 km2 is the longest river in the study area the elevation of the watershed ranges from 1880 6 m to 2837 6 m above the mean sea level the prevailing climate in the watershed is humid and mild the mean annual air temperature and precipitation are about 15 c and 1075 mm respectively land covers of the watershed mainly consist of forest about 55 of the watershed area cropland 20 urban area 17 water 5 and pasture 3 most of the croplands are located around the baoxiang river and southwestern lake dianchi watershed slopes of nearly half area of the watershed are larger than 20 the main soil type is the red soil which is easy to weather and hydrolyze since red soil covers more than 60 of the basin area the region is vulnerable to suffer from soil erosion lake dianchi is now facing a serious eutrophication problem resulting from a mass of nutrient inputs from fertilizer application urban storm runoff and domestic sewage etc water quality restoration for lake dianchi has raised considerable attention and become a great challenge along with booming population and urbanization in this study pmas were identified based on diffuse total phosphorus tp loading which is regarded as the main culprit that leads to eutrophication of lake dianchi liu et al 2006 wu et al 2017 2 2 methodological framework the proposed modelling framework for targeting pmas at the watershed scale integrates watershed simulation and nutrient abatement optimization fig 2 in this study swat was used for spatial delineation and simulation of terrestrial and instream processes at the watershed scale the ideal nutrient load reduction defined as ilr was calculated with an optimization model constrained by water quality standards the pmas for lake dianchi watershed were identified by ranking sub watersheds with the ilr criterion the decision procedure is elucidated as follows 2 2 1 step 1 watershed delineation and simulation with swat the watershed was delineated into sub watersheds based on spatial properties including digital elevation model dem and river networks each sub watershed was partitioned into smaller hydrologic response units hrus the basic computational units a swat model was established and run to simulate hydrological and nutrient cycles in each hru and subsequently the instream transport processes to improve prediction performance sensitive swat parameters were calibrated based on the observations in the discharge and water quality monitoring stations watershed simulation with swat provides the estimation of present day spatial diffuse tp load contributions which is the basis of pma identification 2 2 2 step2 ilr so model development and solution the calibrated swat model quantifies relationship between overland diffuse tp reduction in sub watersheds and water quality improvement in their connected river segments the ilr so model an integration of swat simulation and optimization algorithm was developed to calculate the ilr ratio which represents the relative tp load reduction to the present day total tp loads in each sub watershed it was formulated with the objective to minimize tp reduction amounts in the entire watershed which is constrained to satisfy the water quality standards the ilr so model integrates swat which involves complicated processes and therefore cannot be solved directly with the conventional gradient based algorithms chaparro et al 2008 a metamodeling based optimization approach integrating lmbp with genetic algorithm ga was used to solve the ilr so model without the need to access detailed mechanistic equations of swat by solving the ilr so model the ilr ratios of sub watersheds were calculated 2 2 3 step 3 identification of pmas instead of tp loading per unit area or across a river segment ilr was used as the criterion to identify pmas to eliminate interference of different sub watershed sizes on pma identification ilr amounts per unit area were calculated for each sub watershed based on the ilr ratios optimized with the ilr so model for the rivers meeting water quality standards their adjacent sub watersheds were regarded as very low level priority areas the other sub watersheds were prioritized based on the unit ilr amounts the sub watershed with a higher rank indicated a greater priority to implement management practices 2 3 watershed simulation with swat 2 3 1 swat model development swat was employed to develop a simulation model for lake dianchi watershed developed by the united states department of agriculture usda swat is a semi distributed and physically based watershed modelling tool computing at daily time steps swat consists of computation modules including hydrology plant growth soil erosion nutrients pesticides and agricultural management practices etc watershed simulation with swat is divided into overland and channelized portions meaurio et al 2015 the overland portion calculates flow sediment and other constituents e g nutrients and pesticides transported into the channel from all hrus for each sub watershed the channelized portion simulates water movement and nutrient cycling through the channel network towards the watershed outlet with physically based methods instream water routing and nutrient transport are simulated with the modified kinematic wave model and qual2e model respectively surface runoff is predicted with the modified soil conservation service curve number scs cn method based on daily rainfall us scs 1972 soil erosion is computed with the modified universal soil loss equation musle in each hru williams 1975 the simplified version of the erosion productivity impact calculator epic model is used to simulate plant growth krysanova and arnold 2008 the input data required for swat modelling consist of the dem land use types soil properties meteorological data land management strategies and point pollution sources in this study dem with a resolution of 30 m from united states geological survey usgs was used to identify the boundary of the watershed and delineate sub watersheds the lake dianchi watershed was delineated into 64 sub watersheds and further divided into 319 hrus by overlapping land cover soil and slope layers the buffer areas fig 1 were eliminated for not contributing tp loading directly to the tributaries soils were characterized with the soil datasets with the scale of 1 1 000 000 from the yunnan institute of environmental science land cover is developed from landsat tm data in 2008 with a spatial resolution of 30 m tillage and fertilizer application information derives from the farm survey in 2008 across the watershed daily precipitation records from 15 weather stations were used to drive the swat model fig 1 the other meteorological data including daily air temperatures solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed were monitored in the kunming weather station monitored daily effluent flow and tp concentration of wastewater treatment plants wwtps were inputted into the swat model as point sources outflows of wwtps directly discharge into the nearby streams daily flow data were monitored at two stations ganhaizi station in the baoxiang river and kunming station in the panlong river monthly observed tp concentration data were gathered from 2004 to 2010 at the outlet of the baoxiang river baoxiang station 2 3 2 model calibration and validation some parameters have significant influence on the swat model results but cannot be directly determined by field investigation lelis et al 2012 to identify the sensitive parameters for calibration a manual one at a time oat sensitivity analysis was conducted giri et al 2015 seventeen sensitive parameters associated with runoff and tp simulation were detected calibration and validation were carried out to improve predictive performance for the swat model the overall simulation period is from 2001 to 2010 the first two years 2001 2002 were taken as warm up years to minimize the impact of uncertain initial system conditions the usgs load estimator loadest regression model park and engel 2016 was used to convert the observed tp concentration samples into continuous loading data the instream flow data from 2003 to 2010 were used to calibrate and validate the swat model the parameters relevant to flow were calibrated from 2003 to 2006 and validated from 2007 to 2010 by comparing simulated discharges with observations afterwards the other tp related parameters were calibrated during 2004 2007 and validated during 2008 2010 based on monthly tp loading data model calibration and validation were conducted with the method of the sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm sufi 2 at the monthly step sufi 2 is a sequential procedure which samples the parameters with the latin hypercube method and determines pentameter uncertain domains with global search abbaspour et al 1997 in this study the swat model for lake dianchi watershed was calibrated with two iterations and each with 1000 runs the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient was adopted to quantitatively describe predictive accuracy for the swat model nash and sutcliffe 1970 2 4 ilr so model development for pma identification an ilr so model integrating swat with optimal decision making was developed to target pmas for lake dianchi watershed based on ilr hrus the basic swat computational units are decentralized blocks and thus not appropriate to be used for integrated management therefore pmas were identified at the sub watershed scale the tp reduction ratios of each sub watershed were defined as decision variables for optimization our study aims to guide bmp placement for nps pollution mitigation and therefore abatement of point source pollution was not taken into account the optimization model is based on the hypothesis that bmp cost is positively correlated with tp load abatement in this regard minimizing tp load reduction under constraints of water quality standards indicates achieving the management goal with minimum conservation efforts the ilr so model is formulated as follows objective function minimizing tp load reduction for lake dianchi watershed 1 min k 1 k λ k sl k constraints 1 water quality standards constraints 2 tp m 0 tp m tp m 0 sta m m 1 2 m 2 watershed simulation equations 3 tp m 0 sim m sl 1 sl 2 sl k 4 tp m sim m sl 1 sl 2 sl k λ 1 λ 2 λ k 3 technical constraints 5 0 λ k 1 k 1 2 k where k represents the sub watershed with k 1 2 k k is the total number of sub watersheds k 64 m represents the river with m 1 2 m m is the number of rivers m 15 λ k is the tp reduction ratio for the sub watershed k sl k is the background overland tp loading of the sub watershed k tp m 0 is the background tp loading at the outlet of the river m tp m is the tp loading ton inputted into lake dianchi from the river m after reducing overland diffuse tp loss the sim m represents the swat simulation model for the river m with outputs of tp loading at the river outlet the sta m is the expected tp load reduction ratio to reach the water quality standard of the river m which is defined as follows 6 sta m 0 c a m c s m c a m c s m c a m c a m c s m where c a m and c s m are the monitored and standard tp concentration for river m respectively mg l c s m is quantified according to water use of the river m table 1 based on environmental quality standards for surface water of china gb3838 2002 which divides surface water quality conditions into five categories classes i v which limit tp concentrations to 0 02 0 1 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 mg l respectively the sta m is set to 0 when c a m is less than c s m which indicates the river m has reached its water quality standard and thus it s not necessary to implement tp mitigation measures in its adjacent sub watershed in the ilr so model formulated as eqs 1 6 sl k were quantified by swat overland simulation reduced surface tp loading based on λ k was fed back to swat to calculate the instream tp loading λ k is adjusted and optimized by the optimization algorithm in this way ilr so coupled the mechanistic swat model with the optimization model based on optimized λ k the ideal tp load reduction per unit area for each sub watershed ilr k kg ha was calculated as follows 7 ilr k λ k sl k ar k where ar k is the area of the sub watershed k ha a larger ilr k value represents greater tp load reduction requirement which indicates that taking tp mitigation measures in the corresponding sub watershed could contribute to more significant water quality improvement therefore ilr k is regarded as the basic criterion for sub watershed ranking and targeting the sub watersheds with larger ilr k values were identified as higher level pmas 2 5 ilp so model solution with metamodeling the ilr so model an integration of physically based swat simulation and optimal decision making is a complicated non linear simulation optimization problem ga is a promising global search technology to deal with complicated problems holland 1992 it can be easily coupled with simulation models without accessing the detailed mechanistic functions and the computer codes mckinney and lin 1994 as a global random search method ga represents possible solutions in the feasible region as individuals of the population and encodes them as chromosomes with genes fitness of each individual is evaluated based on objective functions of the optimization model individuals with greater fitness values are more likely to survive and generate a new population by crossover and mutation for the next generation swat should be run numerous times during the iterative process of ga to calculate the fitness value for each individual which results in time consuming global search in this study metamodeling is used to reduce computation and improve decision making efficiency metamodeling is an approach to approximate the complicated model with an efficient mathematical surrogate model broad et al 2015 it has been proven effective to speed up process based optimization significantly broad et al 2015 heuvelmans 2010 the lmbp network a back propagation artificial neural network ann incorporating the levenberge marquardt algorithm hagan and menhaj 1994 was used for metamodeling in the present study compared with the conventional back propagation bp algorithm lmbp could improve speed of convergence significantly saini and soni 2002 the procedure to solve the ilr so model integrating ga and metamodeling consists of the following steps 2 5 1 step1 design of experiments the monte carlo method binder 1986 was used to simulate decision variables λ k within the range 0 1 repetitively with a simulation number n 20000 the simulated values of λ k are represented with λ k i i 1 2 n k 1 2 k 2 5 2 step 2 dataset construction reduction ratio samples λ k i were converted into tp loading 8 load k i 1 λ k i sl k where load k i is the overland tp loading for the kth sub watershed and ith sample load k i was inputted into swat and the tp loading at the outlet of each river tp m i was thus obtained 9 tp m i sim m load 1 i load 2 i load k i the reduction ratios and corresponding tp loading outputs are used as the sample dataset for meta model training s m i λ 1 i λ 2 i λ k i tp m i 2 5 3 step 3 metamodeling with lmbp the samples s m i were divided into three datasets randomly for lmbp training among which 60 were the training set 20 were the validation set and the remaining 20 were the test set the network weights were adjusted based on the training set the validation set was synchronously monitored and the training process would be interrupted when the validation error increased during 6 continuous iterations network training would also terminate when reaching the error threshold of 1 0 10 4 or the maximum iteration number of 100 the predictive performance was evaluated with the test set the metamodel for the mth river trained with lmbp was represented with net m which was used to substitute for sim m if reaching the precision threshold otherwise the simulation number n was required to be increased and the above steps should be repeated to train new networks the swat model was replaced with net m and thus tp m the tp loading of the mth river was estimated with eq 10 10 tp m net m λ 1 λ 2 λ k 2 5 4 step 4 optimization with ga the ilr so model was solved with ga by adopting eq 1 as the fitness function for individual evaluation and selection during the iterative process of ga the individuals violating the constraints formulated as eq 10 were eliminated after some trial runs ga with a population number of 100 crossover probability of 0 8 and mutation probability of 0 1 was used to explore optimal solutions the search process would be terminated when exceeding the maximum generation number 500 or the average variation of fitness values less than 1 0 10 4 by solving the ilr so model with ga the optimal tp load reduction ratio λ k for each sub watershed could be obtained all the sub watersheds were subsequently ranked based on ilr k which was calculated with eq 7 3 results and discussions 3 1 swat calibration and validation the parameters were automatically optimized within their predefined allowable value ranges during the calibration period the calibrated values of selected parameters were presented in table 2 the values of cn2 sol awc and sol k varied spatially among different hrus and thus they were calibrated relatively to their initial reference values usle p and usle k are two important parameters for sediment simulation although sediment was not calibrated in this study for lack of observed data the parameters related to sediment were still taken into consideration as most p losses moves with sediment kronvang et al 1997 performance of the swat model with the optimized parameters was calibrated and validated by comparing simulated flow and tp loading results with observations fig 3 the model performance was evaluated with nse the nse value greater than 0 5 is commonly considered to be satisfactory good for the value above 0 65 and very good for the value larger than 0 75 moriasi et al 2007 model performance for flow simulation at the two stations is similar nse reached to 0 76 and 0 81 during the calibration period in the kunming fig 3a and ganhaizi fig 3b stations respectively a good performance was also achieved during the validation period the nse values for flow validation in at the kunming and ganhaizi stations are 0 86 and 0 78 respectively there is no obvious drop in performance from calibration to validation which indicates that the swat model is reliable for flow prediction in lake dianchi watershed the model could capture both the baseflow and peak flow in the two stations most areas in the downstream panlong watershed are urbanized where surface runoff demonstrates more significant inter annual fluctuation caused by anthropic activities by contrast the baoxiang watershed is dominated by cropland and instream flow shows relatively regular seasonal variation model performance for tp loading predictions is not as good as flow but could still be considered satisfactory fig 3c nse for the validation period 0 74 is higher than that of the calibration period 0 64 the reason is that there are more loading peaks during the calibration period 2004 2007 some of which could not be well captured with the model whereas tp loading is much lower during the validation period which might be a result of implementation of management practices in the watershed during the last decade e g buffer strips and wetlands the peaks of tp loads and stream flow are synchronously which usually occur in summer june to august driven by rainfall events 3 2 identification of pmas the calibrated swat model for the lake dianchi watershed was run over the period of 2001 2010 and tp losses in each sub watershed were estimated the results of tp yields were analyzed in a typical wet year 2007 spatial distribution of diffuse tp loading demonstrates significant spatial heterogeneity fig 4 the upstream baoxiang river watershed and southeastern dianchi watershed are the main source areas of tp losses which results from fertilizer application in cropland diffuse tp loads in the upstream watershed of the panlong river are less than 0 1 kg ha where the dominated landcover is forest all the 64 sub watersheds were prioritized according to their diffuse tp contributions which is quantified with corresponding tp loading per unit area fig 4c the sub watersheds around the outlets of the chai river ch and the yuni river yn are significantly more seriously polluted by diffuse p 3 25 kg ha and 3 20 kg ha for sub watershed 48 and 43 respectively than other areas the tp loads and areas of the ranked sub watersheds were cumulated respectively the tp and area cumulative ratio curves fig 4a b demonstrate that 85 of the total diffuse tp loads derive from a small fraction of the watershed area 30 the tp cumulative ratio curve increases sharply with the higher ranked sub watersheds and then levels up gently most sub watersheds contribute merely a small percentage of tp losses for the entire watershed spatial distributions of tp loading in lake dianchi watershed indicate that pma identification is critical for diffuse tp abatement and bmp placement according to the gb3838 2002 standards most rivers in the watershed are far from reaching the water quality standards except the luolong ll laoyu ly nanchong nc baiyu by and dongda dd rivers for the panlong river and baoxiang river the two largest rivers in the watershed it was estimated that nearly 75 and 77 of the instream diffuse tp loading should be reduced to meet the water quality standards respectively the ilr of each sub watershed was calculated with the ilr so model there are 20 out of 64 sub watersheds not taken into account for tp load reduction since water quality standards were satisfied in their adjacent rivers fig 5 after being ranked with the ilr criterion the sub watersheds were classified into four categories high medium low and very low priority levels based on cumulative tp reduction relative to the total tp reduction requirement table 3 cumulative tp reduction ratios with 60 90 and 100 were used to classify sub watersheds with tp loading reduction requirement into high medium and low level pmas the sub watersheds without tp reduction requirement were identified at very low levels including the 20 sub watersheds connected to the rivers reaching water quality standards and 12 sub watersheds where the ilr was equal to zero the ilr varied from 0 87 to 3 25 kg ha 0 26 to 0 60 kg ha and 0 01 to 0 15 kg ha for high medium and low level pmas respectively six sub watersheds were regarded as pmas with a high level priority located in the watersheds of baoxiang chai and yuni rivers where the dominated land use type was cropland fig 5 the downstream watershed of the panlong river was identified as medium level pmas where nps pollution derives from urban storm water predominantly with the ilr so method sub watershed management priority is determined based on optimized tp load reduction which is regarded as ideal because load reduction potentials are not taken into account however tp mitigation capacity might vary spatially with applicable conservation practices and local landscapes the ilr optimized by the ilr so approach could not be regarded as predicted or expected bmp efficiency it is merely used for spatial comparison and ranking in this study 3 3 comparison with other targeting methods the proposed ilr so targeting method was compared with the conventional luai fig 6 a and lii methods fig 6b which are based on overland pollutant losses per unit area and pollutant loading for each reach segment respectively point sources were omitted when estimating instream loading for the lii method to eliminate interference of point sources on pma identification and make the its results comparable with luai and ilr so the thresholds of cumulative tp ratios 60 90 and 100 were used to divide sub watersheds into high medium and low level pmas with the luai and lii methods consistently with pmas identification with the ilr so method the very low level priority areas without tp abatement requirements were not identified for the luai and lii methods since water quality standards were not taken into account with these conventional methods despite that the southwestern sub watersheds suffer from large diffuse agricultural tp losses some rivers have reached water quality standards e g the average tp concentrations are 0 07 and 0 13 respectively in contrast with class iii limiting tp concentration to 0 2 mg l the reason is that the southwestern sub watersheds are not interfered by domestic pollution as much as the other areas e g the northern sub watersheds for instance 85 0 of the sub watershed 26 located in downstream of the panlong river is occupied by residential areas whereas for the sub watershed 42 in the nanchong river the proportion is only 1 8 fig 1 the luai and lii methods identified most area of the southwestern sub watersheds as high level pmas regardless of the fact that water quality standards were already satisfied which resulted in a waste of time and resources pmas identified with the luai method are consistent with diffuse tp spatial distributions fig 4c compared with luai more sub watersheds adjacent to the watershed outlets were regarded as higher priority areas with the ilr so method e g sub watersheds 21 and 26 around the outlets of the yunliang river and the baoxiang river respectively it makes sense because the ilr so method incorporated connectivity between pollution sources and instream loading and it s commonly recognized that nutrient abatement at watershed outlets are more efficient arabi et al 2006 the luai method is more applicable for local concerns at the sub watershed or field scale lii targeted pmas are mostly located in the near shore areas reflecting effects of tp accumulation in channels for instance the downstream sub watersheds of the baoxiang river were identified as high level pmas sub watersheds 22 and 31 with the lii method fig 5 whereas they were low level pmas with the ilr so method contrary to luai and lii the ilr so method presents modest pma identification results by taking both overland nutrient losses and instream transport processes into consideration 3 4 implications of uncertainty evaluation of uncertainty associated with watershed management has triggered worldwide attentions the designed implementation strategies of bmps might not be able to achieve the expected water quality goals due to uncertainty in watershed simulation considerable uncertainty sources for nutrient estimation at the watershed scale have been addressed there is evidence that parameters of watershed models would affect nutrient fate and transport significantly arabi et al 2007 parameter uncertainty could be mitigated by conducting calibration based on observed data to some extent but it still remains one of the major uncertainty sources benaman and shoemaker 2004 different projections of future climate change and landuse scenarios are also important factors influencing watershed hydrology and nutrient loading wu et al 2012 destouni et al 2017 concluded that temporal nutrient loads were primarily dominated by hydro climatically driven water discharge across sweden spatial resolution of input data e g dem land cover and soil properties could have significant impacts on watershed model predictions zhang et al 2014 a thorough uncertainty analysis was not conducted so far in our study because for hotspot identification with complicated watershed modelling there is a tendency to adopt best fit parameters and overlook randomness of climate change and hydrologic conditions niraula et al 2013 winchell et al 2015 in addition uncertainty based simulation optimization is extremely time consuming the physically based model should be run numerous times during the globally searching process the times of simulation run could increase exponentially with the number of uncertainty factors although tremendous progress has been made for uncertainty based optimization in recent decades lee and labadie 2007 cheng et al 2017 huang et al 2017 complicated simulation optimization based on uncertainty analysis is still limited by large computational demands development of advanced and efficient approaches are thus required for more robust bmp decision making by enabling rigorous uncertainty analysis 4 conclusion a simulation optimization approach with ideal load reduction ilr so was proposed to identify the watershed priority management areas under water quality constraints it could support decision making in identification of hot spots and bmp placement at the watershed scale the modelling framework was used for pma identification in lake dianchi watershed which is a large watershed with significant spatial heterogeneity and comprising multiple tributaries 1 the watershed simulation results demonstrated that tp spatial distribution had significant heterogeneity about 30 of the watershed area contributed 75 of tp loading therefore it s essential to identify pmas at the watershed scale seven out of 64 sub watersheds where cropland is the dominated land use type were identified as high level pmas 2 pmas identification with the proposed ilr so method was compared with the overland nutrient loss based luai and the instream nutrient loading based lii methods the results indicate ilr so is a rational method by taking into account both pollution sources and instream processes by incorporating water quality standards of multiple rivers draining into lake dianchi ilr so identified less pma areas than the conventional strategies for excluding areas without nutrient reduction requirement which could contribute to more efficient watershed management 3 the 15 major rivers draining into lake dianchi are distinct in location length pathway and water use that shows the ilr so approach s advantages in supporting decision making in the complex watershed system and serving various conservation objectives the approach is especially appropriate for but not limited to the watersheds with long hydrologic residence time in channel networks the ilr so approach could also be extended to cases where a river has hierarchical water quality standards from headwater to downstream acknowledgement the paper was supported by the national science foundation of china 51779002 and national basic research program of china 2015cb458900 
7243,targeting nonpoint source nps pollution hot spots is of vital importance for placement of best management practices bmps although physically based watershed models have been widely used to estimate nutrient emissions connections between nutrient abatement and compliance of water quality standards have been rarely considered in nps hotspot ranking which may lead to ineffective decision making it s critical to develop a strategy to identify priority management areas pmas based on water quality response to nutrient load mitigation a water quality constrained pma identification framework was thereby proposed in this study based on the simulation optimization approach with ideal load reduction ilr so it integrates the physically based soil and water assessment tool swat model and an optimization model under constraints of site specific water quality standards to our knowledge it was the first effort to identify pmas with simulation based optimization the swat model was established to simulate temporal and spatial nutrient loading and evaluate effectiveness of pollution mitigation a metamodel was trained to establish a quantitative relationship between sources and water quality ranking of priority areas is based on required nutrient load reduction in each sub watershed targeting to satisfy water quality standards in waterbodies which was calculated with genetic algorithm ga the proposed approach was used for identification of pmas on the basis of diffuse total phosphorus tp in lake dianchi watershed one of the three most eutrophic large lakes in china the modeling results demonstrated that 85 of diffuse tp came from 30 of the watershed area compared with the two conventional targeting strategies based on overland nutrient loss and instream nutrient loading the ilr so model identified distinct pmas and narrowed down the coverage of management areas this study addressed the urgent need to incorporate water quality response into pma identification

area diffuse phosphorus metamodeling simulation optimization approach 1 introduction nonpoint source nps pollution resulted from agricultural activities and urban runoff has caused water quality deterioration and eutrophication in waterbodies across the world conley et al 2009 since significant achievement has been made to deal with point source pollution in recent years excess nps nutrient loss has increasingly become a threat for water quality improvement and aquatic ecosystem restoration sharpley and wang 2014 the nps pollution presents significant spatial heterogeneity due to diverse soil types topographical properties climatic conditions and human activities which is difficult to identify and control schoumans et al 2014 xu et al 2016 to improve water quality affected by excess nps nutrient loss best management practices bmps are effective and widely implemented to control transport and delivery of nutrients to waterbodies chaubey et al 2010 laik et al 2014 for large scale watersheds it s costly and technically difficult to implement bmps throughout the watersheds spatial heterogeneity of nps should be recognized as an important consideration for bmp placement at the watershed scale it s reported that some sub watersheds contribute significantly more nutrient loads than others schilling and wolter 2009 strauss et al 2007 white et al 2009 confining bmps to high polluted areas is usually more cost effective than implementing universal controls or random placement giri et al 2012 strauss et al 2007 consequently identification of vulnerable areas that pose greater risk of nps pollution is crucial for more practical and efficient management strategies taking into account both time and financial resource constraints the concept of critical source areas csas has thereby been widely adopted for cost effective watershed management decision making which are defined as relatively small portions of watersheds contributing a large quantity of pollutant loads to nearby water bodies renkenberger et al 2016 wei et al 2017 identification of csas can be conducted through field monitoring or numerical model simulation sharpley et al 2002 field specific measurement of pollutant loads at the watershed scale is time consuming and expensive which can only represent the local characteristics giri et al 2012 the physically based watershed models are effective tools to support csa identification by tracking the complicated hydrologic soil erosion plant growing and nutrient transport processes and estimating nutrient spatial distributions based on monitored discharges and nutrient concentrations baginska et al 2003 niraula et al 2013 yang et al 2016 improvement in watershed modelling and targeting approaches in recent decades has enabled reliable identifications of csas niraula et al 2013 analyzed the effect of model choice on identification of csas hughes et al 2005 used multi criteria analysis considering factors that influence overall potential for nutrient loss shen et al 2015 presented a stepwise approach to identify csas based on specific uses of particular water bodies defined as water functional zones huang et al 2015 identified csas based on the relationship between precipitation and nutrient yields which could provide a better coverage through accommodating spatial precipitation characteristics in previous studies targeting csas with watershed simulation models is usually based on the total source pollutant loads from land units loads per unit area index luai giri et al 2012 levi et al 2018 however luai overlooks pollutant transport and transformation processes in channels and thus could not represent distinct water quality responses to spatially diverse nutrient abatement which is of vital importance to guide bmp placement although the impacts of nps pollution on water quality have triggered worldwide attention wall et al 2011 responses of rivers and lakes to nutrient load abatement have been rarely incorporated in targeting csas sharpley et al 2003 stated that targeting csas should explicitly demonstrate that a these areas are the main sources of pollution and b implementing mitigation practices at these areas will significantly reduce pollutant concentration in receiving waterbodies hydrological connectivity between overland pollution sources and waterbodies has received limited attention yu et al 2015 thomas et al 2016 only some preliminary attempts have been made to weight land units according to their distance to the water bodies johnes and heathwaite 1997 lane et al 2009 superior to the distance index physically based models are able to serve as more sophisticated and reliable tools by representing complicated channel transport processes some studies targeted csas based on total pollutant loads across the river segments load impact index lii tuppad and srinivasan 2008 giri et al 2014 the lii incorporates contributions of the entire upstream areas it cannot eliminate impacts of the pollutant loads from the upstream and consequently the downstream areas have a great chance to be identified as csas if the upstream areas are seriously polluted the csas identified with the luai and lii methods focus on seriously polluted overland areas and river segments respectively however the ultimate management goal is to improve water quality in receiving waterbodies in this regard the csas identified based on current pollutant loading might not provide sufficient support to guide bmp implementation without connecting nutrient abatement with site specific water quality goal compliance that might result in inefficient bmp placement or failing to reach the water quality targets there is a critical need for providing deep insights into water quality response to pollution mitigation which has been rarely considered when targeting csas to overcome the limitations of the conventional methods for csas identification we developed a water quality constrained targeting framework the concept of priority management areas pmas is adopted chen et al 2014 heck et al 2017 instead of merely focusing on pollutant loading pmas are defined as the areas where diffuse pollution mitigation can achieve relatively better water quality improvement in the present study pmas represent the areas with a high priority for bmp implementation a simulation optimization approach based on ideal load reduction ilr so was developed to identify pmas integrating an optimization model with the physically based soil and water assessment tool swat watershed model in this study ideal load reduction ilr was defined as the required nutrient load abatement in each land unit to meet site specific water quality standards in particular waterbodies the swat model was used to simulate nutrient fate and transport at the watershed scale including both overland and instream processes a levenberge marquardt back propagation lmbp network was established to quantify water quality response to nutrient load reduction the ilr was calculated with an optimization model incorporating constraints of water quality standards the optimization approach has been widely used for optimal decision making in nutrient load allocation or abatement estimation destouni et al 2006 gren and destouni 2012 zhang et al 2017 however simulation based optimization to the best of our knowledge has not been used for csa pma ranking the ilr so approach has advantages over the luai and lii methods as it integrates nps pollution with water quality goal compliance and in the meanwhile mitigates interference of the upstream areas the main objectives of this study are to a establish the connections between nutrient load abatement and compliance of site specific water quality standards and b prioritize areas to implement bmps for nps pollution mitigation with the new ilr criterion the ilr so was used to identify pmas in the lake dianchi watershed which incorporates multiple tributaries with distinct water uses and water quality standards the detailed modelling procedure and results are presented in the following sections 2 material and methodology 2 1 study area lake dianchi located in the southwestern china is the sixth largest lake in china and the largest one in yunnan province with a capacity of 15 8 108 m3 and an average water depth of 5 m it is among the three most eutrophic shallow large lakes in china the watershed 102 29 103 01 e and 24 29 25 28 n covers a drainage area of 2920 km2 the main tributaries fig 1 draining into lake dianchi include the panlong pl river baoxiang bx river and luolong ll river etc the panlong river with a length of 108 km and drainage area of 847 km2 is the longest river in the study area the elevation of the watershed ranges from 1880 6 m to 2837 6 m above the mean sea level the prevailing climate in the watershed is humid and mild the mean annual air temperature and precipitation are about 15 c and 1075 mm respectively land covers of the watershed mainly consist of forest about 55 of the watershed area cropland 20 urban area 17 water 5 and pasture 3 most of the croplands are located around the baoxiang river and southwestern lake dianchi watershed slopes of nearly half area of the watershed are larger than 20 the main soil type is the red soil which is easy to weather and hydrolyze since red soil covers more than 60 of the basin area the region is vulnerable to suffer from soil erosion lake dianchi is now facing a serious eutrophication problem resulting from a mass of nutrient inputs from fertilizer application urban storm runoff and domestic sewage etc water quality restoration for lake dianchi has raised considerable attention and become a great challenge along with booming population and urbanization in this study pmas were identified based on diffuse total phosphorus tp loading which is regarded as the main culprit that leads to eutrophication of lake dianchi liu et al 2006 wu et al 2017 2 2 methodological framework the proposed modelling framework for targeting pmas at the watershed scale integrates watershed simulation and nutrient abatement optimization fig 2 in this study swat was used for spatial delineation and simulation of terrestrial and instream processes at the watershed scale the ideal nutrient load reduction defined as ilr was calculated with an optimization model constrained by water quality standards the pmas for lake dianchi watershed were identified by ranking sub watersheds with the ilr criterion the decision procedure is elucidated as follows 2 2 1 step 1 watershed delineation and simulation with swat the watershed was delineated into sub watersheds based on spatial properties including digital elevation model dem and river networks each sub watershed was partitioned into smaller hydrologic response units hrus the basic computational units a swat model was established and run to simulate hydrological and nutrient cycles in each hru and subsequently the instream transport processes to improve prediction performance sensitive swat parameters were calibrated based on the observations in the discharge and water quality monitoring stations watershed simulation with swat provides the estimation of present day spatial diffuse tp load contributions which is the basis of pma identification 2 2 2 step2 ilr so model development and solution the calibrated swat model quantifies relationship between overland diffuse tp reduction in sub watersheds and water quality improvement in their connected river segments the ilr so model an integration of swat simulation and optimization algorithm was developed to calculate the ilr ratio which represents the relative tp load reduction to the present day total tp loads in each sub watershed it was formulated with the objective to minimize tp reduction amounts in the entire watershed which is constrained to satisfy the water quality standards the ilr so model integrates swat which involves complicated processes and therefore cannot be solved directly with the conventional gradient based algorithms chaparro et al 2008 a metamodeling based optimization approach integrating lmbp with genetic algorithm ga was used to solve the ilr so model without the need to access detailed mechanistic equations of swat by solving the ilr so model the ilr ratios of sub watersheds were calculated 2 2 3 step 3 identification of pmas instead of tp loading per unit area or across a river segment ilr was used as the criterion to identify pmas to eliminate interference of different sub watershed sizes on pma identification ilr amounts per unit area were calculated for each sub watershed based on the ilr ratios optimized with the ilr so model for the rivers meeting water quality standards their adjacent sub watersheds were regarded as very low level priority areas the other sub watersheds were prioritized based on the unit ilr amounts the sub watershed with a higher rank indicated a greater priority to implement management practices 2 3 watershed simulation with swat 2 3 1 swat model development swat was employed to develop a simulation model for lake dianchi watershed developed by the united states department of agriculture usda swat is a semi distributed and physically based watershed modelling tool computing at daily time steps swat consists of computation modules including hydrology plant growth soil erosion nutrients pesticides and agricultural management practices etc watershed simulation with swat is divided into overland and channelized portions meaurio et al 2015 the overland portion calculates flow sediment and other constituents e g nutrients and pesticides transported into the channel from all hrus for each sub watershed the channelized portion simulates water movement and nutrient cycling through the channel network towards the watershed outlet with physically based methods instream water routing and nutrient transport are simulated with the modified kinematic wave model and qual2e model respectively surface runoff is predicted with the modified soil conservation service curve number scs cn method based on daily rainfall us scs 1972 soil erosion is computed with the modified universal soil loss equation musle in each hru williams 1975 the simplified version of the erosion productivity impact calculator epic model is used to simulate plant growth krysanova and arnold 2008 the input data required for swat modelling consist of the dem land use types soil properties meteorological data land management strategies and point pollution sources in this study dem with a resolution of 30 m from united states geological survey usgs was used to identify the boundary of the watershed and delineate sub watersheds the lake dianchi watershed was delineated into 64 sub watersheds and further divided into 319 hrus by overlapping land cover soil and slope layers the buffer areas fig 1 were eliminated for not contributing tp loading directly to the tributaries soils were characterized with the soil datasets with the scale of 1 1 000 000 from the yunnan institute of environmental science land cover is developed from landsat tm data in 2008 with a spatial resolution of 30 m tillage and fertilizer application information derives from the farm survey in 2008 across the watershed daily precipitation records from 15 weather stations were used to drive the swat model fig 1 the other meteorological data including daily air temperatures solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed were monitored in the kunming weather station monitored daily effluent flow and tp concentration of wastewater treatment plants wwtps were inputted into the swat model as point sources outflows of wwtps directly discharge into the nearby streams daily flow data were monitored at two stations ganhaizi station in the baoxiang river and kunming station in the panlong river monthly observed tp concentration data were gathered from 2004 to 2010 at the outlet of the baoxiang river baoxiang station 2 3 2 model calibration and validation some parameters have significant influence on the swat model results but cannot be directly determined by field investigation lelis et al 2012 to identify the sensitive parameters for calibration a manual one at a time oat sensitivity analysis was conducted giri et al 2015 seventeen sensitive parameters associated with runoff and tp simulation were detected calibration and validation were carried out to improve predictive performance for the swat model the overall simulation period is from 2001 to 2010 the first two years 2001 2002 were taken as warm up years to minimize the impact of uncertain initial system conditions the usgs load estimator loadest regression model park and engel 2016 was used to convert the observed tp concentration samples into continuous loading data the instream flow data from 2003 to 2010 were used to calibrate and validate the swat model the parameters relevant to flow were calibrated from 2003 to 2006 and validated from 2007 to 2010 by comparing simulated discharges with observations afterwards the other tp related parameters were calibrated during 2004 2007 and validated during 2008 2010 based on monthly tp loading data model calibration and validation were conducted with the method of the sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm sufi 2 at the monthly step sufi 2 is a sequential procedure which samples the parameters with the latin hypercube method and determines pentameter uncertain domains with global search abbaspour et al 1997 in this study the swat model for lake dianchi watershed was calibrated with two iterations and each with 1000 runs the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient was adopted to quantitatively describe predictive accuracy for the swat model nash and sutcliffe 1970 2 4 ilr so model development for pma identification an ilr so model integrating swat with optimal decision making was developed to target pmas for lake dianchi watershed based on ilr hrus the basic swat computational units are decentralized blocks and thus not appropriate to be used for integrated management therefore pmas were identified at the sub watershed scale the tp reduction ratios of each sub watershed were defined as decision variables for optimization our study aims to guide bmp placement for nps pollution mitigation and therefore abatement of point source pollution was not taken into account the optimization model is based on the hypothesis that bmp cost is positively correlated with tp load abatement in this regard minimizing tp load reduction under constraints of water quality standards indicates achieving the management goal with minimum conservation efforts the ilr so model is formulated as follows objective function minimizing tp load reduction for lake dianchi watershed 1 min k 1 k λ k sl k constraints 1 water quality standards constraints 2 tp m 0 tp m tp m 0 sta m m 1 2 m 2 watershed simulation equations 3 tp m 0 sim m sl 1 sl 2 sl k 4 tp m sim m sl 1 sl 2 sl k λ 1 λ 2 λ k 3 technical constraints 5 0 λ k 1 k 1 2 k where k represents the sub watershed with k 1 2 k k is the total number of sub watersheds k 64 m represents the river with m 1 2 m m is the number of rivers m 15 λ k is the tp reduction ratio for the sub watershed k sl k is the background overland tp loading of the sub watershed k tp m 0 is the background tp loading at the outlet of the river m tp m is the tp loading ton inputted into lake dianchi from the river m after reducing overland diffuse tp loss the sim m represents the swat simulation model for the river m with outputs of tp loading at the river outlet the sta m is the expected tp load reduction ratio to reach the water quality standard of the river m which is defined as follows 6 sta m 0 c a m c s m c a m c s m c a m c a m c s m where c a m and c s m are the monitored and standard tp concentration for river m respectively mg l c s m is quantified according to water use of the river m table 1 based on environmental quality standards for surface water of china gb3838 2002 which divides surface water quality conditions into five categories classes i v which limit tp concentrations to 0 02 0 1 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 mg l respectively the sta m is set to 0 when c a m is less than c s m which indicates the river m has reached its water quality standard and thus it s not necessary to implement tp mitigation measures in its adjacent sub watershed in the ilr so model formulated as eqs 1 6 sl k were quantified by swat overland simulation reduced surface tp loading based on λ k was fed back to swat to calculate the instream tp loading λ k is adjusted and optimized by the optimization algorithm in this way ilr so coupled the mechanistic swat model with the optimization model based on optimized λ k the ideal tp load reduction per unit area for each sub watershed ilr k kg ha was calculated as follows 7 ilr k λ k sl k ar k where ar k is the area of the sub watershed k ha a larger ilr k value represents greater tp load reduction requirement which indicates that taking tp mitigation measures in the corresponding sub watershed could contribute to more significant water quality improvement therefore ilr k is regarded as the basic criterion for sub watershed ranking and targeting the sub watersheds with larger ilr k values were identified as higher level pmas 2 5 ilp so model solution with metamodeling the ilr so model an integration of physically based swat simulation and optimal decision making is a complicated non linear simulation optimization problem ga is a promising global search technology to deal with complicated problems holland 1992 it can be easily coupled with simulation models without accessing the detailed mechanistic functions and the computer codes mckinney and lin 1994 as a global random search method ga represents possible solutions in the feasible region as individuals of the population and encodes them as chromosomes with genes fitness of each individual is evaluated based on objective functions of the optimization model individuals with greater fitness values are more likely to survive and generate a new population by crossover and mutation for the next generation swat should be run numerous times during the iterative process of ga to calculate the fitness value for each individual which results in time consuming global search in this study metamodeling is used to reduce computation and improve decision making efficiency metamodeling is an approach to approximate the complicated model with an efficient mathematical surrogate model broad et al 2015 it has been proven effective to speed up process based optimization significantly broad et al 2015 heuvelmans 2010 the lmbp network a back propagation artificial neural network ann incorporating the levenberge marquardt algorithm hagan and menhaj 1994 was used for metamodeling in the present study compared with the conventional back propagation bp algorithm lmbp could improve speed of convergence significantly saini and soni 2002 the procedure to solve the ilr so model integrating ga and metamodeling consists of the following steps 2 5 1 step1 design of experiments the monte carlo method binder 1986 was used to simulate decision variables λ k within the range 0 1 repetitively with a simulation number n 20000 the simulated values of λ k are represented with λ k i i 1 2 n k 1 2 k 2 5 2 step 2 dataset construction reduction ratio samples λ k i were converted into tp loading 8 load k i 1 λ k i sl k where load k i is the overland tp loading for the kth sub watershed and ith sample load k i was inputted into swat and the tp loading at the outlet of each river tp m i was thus obtained 9 tp m i sim m load 1 i load 2 i load k i the reduction ratios and corresponding tp loading outputs are used as the sample dataset for meta model training s m i λ 1 i λ 2 i λ k i tp m i 2 5 3 step 3 metamodeling with lmbp the samples s m i were divided into three datasets randomly for lmbp training among which 60 were the training set 20 were the validation set and the remaining 20 were the test set the network weights were adjusted based on the training set the validation set was synchronously monitored and the training process would be interrupted when the validation error increased during 6 continuous iterations network training would also terminate when reaching the error threshold of 1 0 10 4 or the maximum iteration number of 100 the predictive performance was evaluated with the test set the metamodel for the mth river trained with lmbp was represented with net m which was used to substitute for sim m if reaching the precision threshold otherwise the simulation number n was required to be increased and the above steps should be repeated to train new networks the swat model was replaced with net m and thus tp m the tp loading of the mth river was estimated with eq 10 10 tp m net m λ 1 λ 2 λ k 2 5 4 step 4 optimization with ga the ilr so model was solved with ga by adopting eq 1 as the fitness function for individual evaluation and selection during the iterative process of ga the individuals violating the constraints formulated as eq 10 were eliminated after some trial runs ga with a population number of 100 crossover probability of 0 8 and mutation probability of 0 1 was used to explore optimal solutions the search process would be terminated when exceeding the maximum generation number 500 or the average variation of fitness values less than 1 0 10 4 by solving the ilr so model with ga the optimal tp load reduction ratio λ k for each sub watershed could be obtained all the sub watersheds were subsequently ranked based on ilr k which was calculated with eq 7 3 results and discussions 3 1 swat calibration and validation the parameters were automatically optimized within their predefined allowable value ranges during the calibration period the calibrated values of selected parameters were presented in table 2 the values of cn2 sol awc and sol k varied spatially among different hrus and thus they were calibrated relatively to their initial reference values usle p and usle k are two important parameters for sediment simulation although sediment was not calibrated in this study for lack of observed data the parameters related to sediment were still taken into consideration as most p losses moves with sediment kronvang et al 1997 performance of the swat model with the optimized parameters was calibrated and validated by comparing simulated flow and tp loading results with observations fig 3 the model performance was evaluated with nse the nse value greater than 0 5 is commonly considered to be satisfactory good for the value above 0 65 and very good for the value larger than 0 75 moriasi et al 2007 model performance for flow simulation at the two stations is similar nse reached to 0 76 and 0 81 during the calibration period in the kunming fig 3a and ganhaizi fig 3b stations respectively a good performance was also achieved during the validation period the nse values for flow validation in at the kunming and ganhaizi stations are 0 86 and 0 78 respectively there is no obvious drop in performance from calibration to validation which indicates that the swat model is reliable for flow prediction in lake dianchi watershed the model could capture both the baseflow and peak flow in the two stations most areas in the downstream panlong watershed are urbanized where surface runoff demonstrates more significant inter annual fluctuation caused by anthropic activities by contrast the baoxiang watershed is dominated by cropland and instream flow shows relatively regular seasonal variation model performance for tp loading predictions is not as good as flow but could still be considered satisfactory fig 3c nse for the validation period 0 74 is higher than that of the calibration period 0 64 the reason is that there are more loading peaks during the calibration period 2004 2007 some of which could not be well captured with the model whereas tp loading is much lower during the validation period which might be a result of implementation of management practices in the watershed during the last decade e g buffer strips and wetlands the peaks of tp loads and stream flow are synchronously which usually occur in summer june to august driven by rainfall events 3 2 identification of pmas the calibrated swat model for the lake dianchi watershed was run over the period of 2001 2010 and tp losses in each sub watershed were estimated the results of tp yields were analyzed in a typical wet year 2007 spatial distribution of diffuse tp loading demonstrates significant spatial heterogeneity fig 4 the upstream baoxiang river watershed and southeastern dianchi watershed are the main source areas of tp losses which results from fertilizer application in cropland diffuse tp loads in the upstream watershed of the panlong river are less than 0 1 kg ha where the dominated landcover is forest all the 64 sub watersheds were prioritized according to their diffuse tp contributions which is quantified with corresponding tp loading per unit area fig 4c the sub watersheds around the outlets of the chai river ch and the yuni river yn are significantly more seriously polluted by diffuse p 3 25 kg ha and 3 20 kg ha for sub watershed 48 and 43 respectively than other areas the tp loads and areas of the ranked sub watersheds were cumulated respectively the tp and area cumulative ratio curves fig 4a b demonstrate that 85 of the total diffuse tp loads derive from a small fraction of the watershed area 30 the tp cumulative ratio curve increases sharply with the higher ranked sub watersheds and then levels up gently most sub watersheds contribute merely a small percentage of tp losses for the entire watershed spatial distributions of tp loading in lake dianchi watershed indicate that pma identification is critical for diffuse tp abatement and bmp placement according to the gb3838 2002 standards most rivers in the watershed are far from reaching the water quality standards except the luolong ll laoyu ly nanchong nc baiyu by and dongda dd rivers for the panlong river and baoxiang river the two largest rivers in the watershed it was estimated that nearly 75 and 77 of the instream diffuse tp loading should be reduced to meet the water quality standards respectively the ilr of each sub watershed was calculated with the ilr so model there are 20 out of 64 sub watersheds not taken into account for tp load reduction since water quality standards were satisfied in their adjacent rivers fig 5 after being ranked with the ilr criterion the sub watersheds were classified into four categories high medium low and very low priority levels based on cumulative tp reduction relative to the total tp reduction requirement table 3 cumulative tp reduction ratios with 60 90 and 100 were used to classify sub watersheds with tp loading reduction requirement into high medium and low level pmas the sub watersheds without tp reduction requirement were identified at very low levels including the 20 sub watersheds connected to the rivers reaching water quality standards and 12 sub watersheds where the ilr was equal to zero the ilr varied from 0 87 to 3 25 kg ha 0 26 to 0 60 kg ha and 0 01 to 0 15 kg ha for high medium and low level pmas respectively six sub watersheds were regarded as pmas with a high level priority located in the watersheds of baoxiang chai and yuni rivers where the dominated land use type was cropland fig 5 the downstream watershed of the panlong river was identified as medium level pmas where nps pollution derives from urban storm water predominantly with the ilr so method sub watershed management priority is determined based on optimized tp load reduction which is regarded as ideal because load reduction potentials are not taken into account however tp mitigation capacity might vary spatially with applicable conservation practices and local landscapes the ilr optimized by the ilr so approach could not be regarded as predicted or expected bmp efficiency it is merely used for spatial comparison and ranking in this study 3 3 comparison with other targeting methods the proposed ilr so targeting method was compared with the conventional luai fig 6 a and lii methods fig 6b which are based on overland pollutant losses per unit area and pollutant loading for each reach segment respectively point sources were omitted when estimating instream loading for the lii method to eliminate interference of point sources on pma identification and make the its results comparable with luai and ilr so the thresholds of cumulative tp ratios 60 90 and 100 were used to divide sub watersheds into high medium and low level pmas with the luai and lii methods consistently with pmas identification with the ilr so method the very low level priority areas without tp abatement requirements were not identified for the luai and lii methods since water quality standards were not taken into account with these conventional methods despite that the southwestern sub watersheds suffer from large diffuse agricultural tp losses some rivers have reached water quality standards e g the average tp concentrations are 0 07 and 0 13 respectively in contrast with class iii limiting tp concentration to 0 2 mg l the reason is that the southwestern sub watersheds are not interfered by domestic pollution as much as the other areas e g the northern sub watersheds for instance 85 0 of the sub watershed 26 located in downstream of the panlong river is occupied by residential areas whereas for the sub watershed 42 in the nanchong river the proportion is only 1 8 fig 1 the luai and lii methods identified most area of the southwestern sub watersheds as high level pmas regardless of the fact that water quality standards were already satisfied which resulted in a waste of time and resources pmas identified with the luai method are consistent with diffuse tp spatial distributions fig 4c compared with luai more sub watersheds adjacent to the watershed outlets were regarded as higher priority areas with the ilr so method e g sub watersheds 21 and 26 around the outlets of the yunliang river and the baoxiang river respectively it makes sense because the ilr so method incorporated connectivity between pollution sources and instream loading and it s commonly recognized that nutrient abatement at watershed outlets are more efficient arabi et al 2006 the luai method is more applicable for local concerns at the sub watershed or field scale lii targeted pmas are mostly located in the near shore areas reflecting effects of tp accumulation in channels for instance the downstream sub watersheds of the baoxiang river were identified as high level pmas sub watersheds 22 and 31 with the lii method fig 5 whereas they were low level pmas with the ilr so method contrary to luai and lii the ilr so method presents modest pma identification results by taking both overland nutrient losses and instream transport processes into consideration 3 4 implications of uncertainty evaluation of uncertainty associated with watershed management has triggered worldwide attentions the designed implementation strategies of bmps might not be able to achieve the expected water quality goals due to uncertainty in watershed simulation considerable uncertainty sources for nutrient estimation at the watershed scale have been addressed there is evidence that parameters of watershed models would affect nutrient fate and transport significantly arabi et al 2007 parameter uncertainty could be mitigated by conducting calibration based on observed data to some extent but it still remains one of the major uncertainty sources benaman and shoemaker 2004 different projections of future climate change and landuse scenarios are also important factors influencing watershed hydrology and nutrient loading wu et al 2012 destouni et al 2017 concluded that temporal nutrient loads were primarily dominated by hydro climatically driven water discharge across sweden spatial resolution of input data e g dem land cover and soil properties could have significant impacts on watershed model predictions zhang et al 2014 a thorough uncertainty analysis was not conducted so far in our study because for hotspot identification with complicated watershed modelling there is a tendency to adopt best fit parameters and overlook randomness of climate change and hydrologic conditions niraula et al 2013 winchell et al 2015 in addition uncertainty based simulation optimization is extremely time consuming the physically based model should be run numerous times during the globally searching process the times of simulation run could increase exponentially with the number of uncertainty factors although tremendous progress has been made for uncertainty based optimization in recent decades lee and labadie 2007 cheng et al 2017 huang et al 2017 complicated simulation optimization based on uncertainty analysis is still limited by large computational demands development of advanced and efficient approaches are thus required for more robust bmp decision making by enabling rigorous uncertainty analysis 4 conclusion a simulation optimization approach with ideal load reduction ilr so was proposed to identify the watershed priority management areas under water quality constraints it could support decision making in identification of hot spots and bmp placement at the watershed scale the modelling framework was used for pma identification in lake dianchi watershed which is a large watershed with significant spatial heterogeneity and comprising multiple tributaries 1 the watershed simulation results demonstrated that tp spatial distribution had significant heterogeneity about 30 of the watershed area contributed 75 of tp loading therefore it s essential to identify pmas at the watershed scale seven out of 64 sub watersheds where cropland is the dominated land use type were identified as high level pmas 2 pmas identification with the proposed ilr so method was compared with the overland nutrient loss based luai and the instream nutrient loading based lii methods the results indicate ilr so is a rational method by taking into account both pollution sources and instream processes by incorporating water quality standards of multiple rivers draining into lake dianchi ilr so identified less pma areas than the conventional strategies for excluding areas without nutrient reduction requirement which could contribute to more efficient watershed management 3 the 15 major rivers draining into lake dianchi are distinct in location length pathway and water use that shows the ilr so approach s advantages in supporting decision making in the complex watershed system and serving various conservation objectives the approach is especially appropriate for but not limited to the watersheds with long hydrologic residence time in channel networks the ilr so approach could also be extended to cases where a river has hierarchical water quality standards from headwater to downstream acknowledgement the paper was supported by the national

7244,many water governance and management issues are complex the complexity of these issues is related to crossing of multiple boundaries political social and jurisdictional as well as physical ecological and biogeochemical resolution of these issues usually requires interactions of many parties with conflicting values and interests operating across multiple boundaries and scales to make decisions the interdependence and feedback among interacting variables processes actors and institutions are hard to model and difficult to forecast thus decision making related to complex water problems needs be contingent and adaptive this paper draws on a number of ideas from complexity science and negotiation theory that may make it easier to cope with the complexities and difficulties of managing boundary crossing water disputes it begins with the water diplomacy framework that was developed and tested over the past several years then it uses three key ideas from complexity science interdependence and interconnectedness uncertainty and feedback emergence and adaptation and three from negotiation theory stakeholder identification and engagement joint fact finding and value creation through option generation to show how application of these ideas can help enhance effectiveness of water management keywords complexity water diplomacy negotiation 1 introduction are we running out of water will water scarcity lead to war is water an economic good for some the answer to these questions may be absolutely yes and some will emphatically insist the opposite yet many will argue that the answer to each question is it depends of course it depends but on what why and how do we get yes and no answers for the same question for simple problems where cause effect relationships are well understood this search for yes no solution works very well however for complex problems clear cut solutions do not exist can we address the supply demand gap through the lens of water scarcity can we provide access to water in urban settlements through the lens of water security can we develop adaptation and mitigation strategies for a changing climate through the lens of sustainability what do these problems have in common and what makes them complex when we can t answer these questions with certainty how should we proceed this paper introduces three foundational ideas from complexity science and three from negotiation theory that can make it easier to resolve complex water management problems in spite of the uncertainty posed by almost all boundary crossing water management situations we begin by summarizing the water diplomacy framework islam and susskind 2013 we will then show how key ideas from complexity science and negotiation theory when used to augment the water diplomacy framework can make it easier for water professionals to manage water resource more effectively 2 water diplomacy framework water as a limited resource lends itself to conflicts over how it should be allocated and managed the origin of many complex water problems is a result of interconnections and feedback among variables processes actors and institutions efforts to manage water with an eye toward immediate needs and long term sustainability will involve many actors and institutions with competing interests and values who demand or expect to be involved in decisions about how resources will be managed effective resolution of conflicting values and interests especially when knowledge of both natural and human systems is uncertain will require new dispute resolution and collective decision making methods the water diplomacy framework wdf is an alternative to the traditional techno or values focused approaches to water governance and management islam and susskind 2013 islam and repella 2015 the wdf starts by asking who decides who gets water and how the wdf aims to understand and resolve water related problems it acknowledges that traditional problem solving frames are adequate to address simple problems where reasonable scientific certainty and consensus about intervention exists fig 1 the wdf hypothesizes that when water challenges stem from complex interconnected uncertain unpredictable and boundary crossing system dynamics with feedback traditional frames for problem solving can be limiting or counter productive a recurrent factor for such limitations is that traditional problem solving frames often separate the observation based technical what is from the value based socio political what ought to be dimensions of the problem the wdf further hypothesizes that when dealing with complex problems these dimensions cannot be de coupled the wdf acknowledges both the limits to knowledge objectivity of observations and subjectivity of interpretation and the contingent nature of our action the wdf actively seeks value creating options and opportunities to allow conflicting interests to be addressed in a sustainable way and begins by focusing on know why before prescribing know how islam and repella 2015 in other words the wdf builds on the differences among those with contending values and interests and seeks to engage representatives of these interests in technical and political problem solving to arrive at a mutually agreeable negotiated resolution the wdf is based on credible scientific knowledge mediated through equity and sustainability as guiding principles for contextual policy action the wdf approach emphasizes that when addressing complex water problems all parties have a legitimate right to have a voice about the evidence used and its interpretation the past evidence and future implications of an intervention metrics of equity and sustainability and the package of actionable solutions these parties include users and producers of water knowledge managers technical experts policy makers decision makers and politicians furthermore the wdf asserts that parties need to seek consensus on guiding principles and mutual value creation when negotiating a resolution 3 using complexity science to better understand the nature of water problems historically we have taken nature apart and analyzed its components in ever increasing detail this mode of analysis design and engineering works well for simple systems in which cause effect relationships are well understood complex problems are those where cause effect relationships are ambiguous uncertainty nonlinearity and feedback are inherent and emergent properties e g holland 1998 pahl wostl 2004 fromm 2005 islam and susskind 2013 section 3 3 for more details on emergence dominate the system evolution fig 1 for this class of problems there is likely to be very little agreement about what the definition or cause of the problem is let alone the best way to resolve it furthermore complex problems are constantly in flux because of natural societal and political dynamics continued use of traditional systems engineering approaches to address complex problems is likely to provide doubtful outcomes kauffmann 1993 barabási and bonabeau 2003 pahl wostl et al 2007 miller and page 2007 islam and susskind 2013 many complex water management problems lie somewhere between certainty uncertainty and consensus no consensus spectrum islam and susskind 2013 the dynamics in this zone of complexity is neither entirely certain nor totally uncertain fig 1 neither the reproducible certainty of science nor and overwhelming consensus for action exists for problems in this zone ideas and tools from complexity science interdependence and interconnectedness uncertainty and feedback emergence and complex adaptive systems may be used to identify the parameters of management problems here pahl wostl 2004 maguire et al

are ambiguous and almost never prospective prediction is not possible with any reasonable degree of certainty nonlinearity and feedback are inherent emergent properties dominate system behavior and response for more details please see snowden and boone 2007 islam and susskind 2013 islam and repella 2015 a failure to appreciate these differences among simple complicated and complex systems could cause us to apply exactly the wrong approach to the right water problem or the right approach to the wrong problem in general continued efforts to refine existing tools like cost benefit analysis and optimization algorithms to address complex problems have not worked e g ackoff 1979 bennis et al 2010 stiglitz et al 2010 while best practices can be used to address simple problems such as the design of a household s water system and systems engineering can be used for complicated problems such as meeting domestic water demand within a water distribution system for a city these tools are not suited for complex problems allocating water for competing and conflicting needs among sectors and uses we can understand and optimize simple and complicated systems by taking them apart and analyzing the details of their cause and effect relationship however for complex systems we do not have similar prospective understanding of cause and effect ideas and tools from negotiation theory stakeholder identification and participation joint fact finding creative options may be used to show how complex water governance and management can be operationalized in practice islam and susskind 2013 we categorize complex problems to be those a that are interconnected with many variables processes actors and institutions b that cross scales domains and boundaries c for which identification of causal connections is nearly impossible and d for which historical records are not very reliable indicators of the future for complex water problems hydrological climatic ecological social and political processes interact nonlinearly with feedback tipping points and thresholds and render identification of an optimal solution virtually impossible over the last several decades complexity science has received increased attention from multiple disciplines e g anderson et al 1988 nicolis and prigogine 1989 lewin 1992 kauffmann 1993 mainzer 1994 bar yam 1997 cilliers 1998 pahl wostl 2004 maguire et al 2006 pahl wostl et al 2007 maguire 2011 cilliers et al 2013 what is usually referred to as complexity science is actually a collection of frameworks theories models and tools from systems engineering chaos theory cybernetics and studies of adaptive systems islam 2017 complex systems by their very nature resist prescriptive diagnosis and this diagnosis is further convoluted by disciplinary jargon for example social scientists often focus on how context specific interactions of actors and institutions create complexity while natural scientists explore how nonlinearity and feedback among variables and processes generate complexity we hope to show how three ideas from complexity science contribute to our understanding of and responses to managing water disputes 3 1 interdependence and interconnectedness complex systems by their very nature cannot be explained by simple cause effect relationships at the heart of a complex system is a collection of interdependent elements variables processes actors and institutions the interactions nonlinearity and feedback among these elements can make the resulting problem definition ambiguous and open to conflicting interpretations in such situations opinion dominates facts and ideology takes over hydrology such issues were highlighted during california s recent drought agricultural industrial and residential users and uses of water received heightened attention in assigning blame for the shortage and identifying places to implement steep water reduction as agriculture is the largest water user various agricultural products received particularly scrutiny alfalfa is the single largest agricultural water user cooley 2015 in the state but as a feed crop is not of primary economic value even as an international export it feeds california cows and california is the top dairy producing state in the nation the value of any crop or other water consuming commodity or service can t be evaluated solely through water in to dollars out comparisons and require understanding the perspectives of and value to the multiple stakeholders for each of these water uses uncertainty about drought duration and intensity further complicates questions about water prioritization and planning conventional solutions that seek to optimize water use in terms of economic value pollution or calories grown per dollar lead to reductive analyses that ignore the interrelationships and second and third order benefits and costs of water uses and proposed solutions these limited analyses and opinions highlight that while many in california see the complex interactions and connections between the interests of domestic industrial agricultural and natural systems stakeholders there are those who hold a singular perspective on the cause and solution to water shortage a networked view of the system described in islam and susskind 2013 surrounding water in california is necessary to both understand and suggest how decisions about sharing water can be made what criteria need to be considered in those decisions and who does the deciding issues intertwine but these interconnections also contribute to opportunities for addressing the water challenges especially regarding agriculture a more comprehensive perspective that relates analysis of agricultural water use to other issue lenses may lead to improved understanding and decision making around water policy almonds and pistachios have similar water use intensity as alfalfa and are among the largest agricultural water users in california cooley 2015 these crops bring in high agricultural revenue and are adapted to the local climate california is the world s largest producer of almonds and the largest u s producer of pistachios taken in context supporting nuts and some fruits may be good uses for agricultural water in california resolving the water crisis will require a substantial shift in agriculture s orientation towards water but california s complex water problem cannot be treated as simply a local agriculture problem given the national and international role of the state s agricultural sector and cultural importance of agriculture within the state complex systems are formed by connections between elements or smaller systems and by virtue of this connectedness a change in one element may create a cascading set of changes among other elements the degree of connectivity varies within and between systems systems with high connectivity experience more cascading effects and systems with low connectivity are more adaptable to change in any one element the hydrological ecological economic and socio political challenges posed above need to be unpacked and the connections among the domains scales and sectors need to be accounted for in problem framing and actions toward problem resolution differences in how complex and interdependent systems take shape also suggest that multiple approaches to problem solving are feasible and will remain contingent on the capacity of the system and constraints imposed by the context however it is not possible make a list of interactions to be exhaustive for complex systems sterman 2000 schlüter et al 2014 bounds must be set to develop an effective model but researchers are challenged to objectively define the scope and scale of such modeling studies additionally coupled models cross disciplines and modelers are unable to point to the theoretical framework of any single discipline to defend the relevant scope srinivasan 2015 one needs to simultaneously balance the scope and level of detail in order to create a parsimonious and communicable model finally critical assessment of models is more challenging when the theories empirical methods and vocabulary drawn upon to create and communicate a model span disciplinary boundaries schlüter et al 2014 garcia et al 2015 a shared understanding of important processes to be included is needed to allow modeling structure scope and detail to remain contingent on and adaptive to the problem context ideas from negotiation theory section 4 provide a way to develop such a shared understanding for the conceptualization of this class of interconnected problems 3 2 uncertainty and feedback our knowledge of real world systems is uncertain we have imperfect information and face a range of unknowns uncertainty manifests in complex water disputes partly because the problem space of the conflict is open in complex water systems it is difficult to plan for possible outcomes when there is no reliable way to forecast the impacts and interactions of changing water supply water quality and various aspects of human and institutional behaviors for example forecasted future flows of the nile river under various climate change scenarios ranged from a 78 decrease to a 30 increase watson et al 1997 recent findings also suggest that climate change could alter inter annual and intra annual variability of the nile flow siam and eltahir 2017 if future flows can t reliably be predicted it will be difficult to anticipate and plan for other dependent factors that impact water security 3 2 1 different faces of uncertainty at its simplest uncertainty describes something that we don t know or know only in an inadequate and imprecise way however how uncertainty is defined or approachedvaries between disciplines some uncertainty can be identified and quantified some can be reduced through gathering more information some can be qualitatively described and some cannot be identified or reduced through any practical means definitions of types of uncertainty range from classification of the source and how it may be reduced to how uncertainty impacts potential actions or outcomes from an event or decision to how perception of uncertainty shapes the decision making process van der sluijs 2005 webster and curry 2011 islam and susskind 2013 we focus on three types of uncertainty susskind and islam 2012 uncertainty of information relates to assigning probabilities to the likelihood of particular events occurring this type of uncertainty ranges from zero in which we are completely confident about the forecasts to intermediate levels which involve events with known probability ranges to high levels of uncertainty in which we have almost no idea about the future uncertainty of action relates to situations where cause effect relationships are not clear such as whether certain policies or programs will produce expected outcome uncertainty of perception occurs when people see what they expect to see rather than what is actually there which can happen when questions are framed in ideological or political terms it is not possible to eliminate uncertainty completely however not all three types are likely to be equally important for a given problem forecasted nile flows may be related to uncertainty of information but given the current state of our scientific knowledge about climate models additional modeling studies will probably not resolve such an uncertainty in the near future yet we need to plan and manage water in the nile basin policy makers and planners can use the uncertainty to generate opportunities for value creation periodic reassessment in light of new data and findings may be used to adapt and ensure desirable outcomes moreover it is important to undertake these scientific analyses together as joint fact finding section 4 1 to define the scope of the analysis relevant to particular problem context 3 2 2 feedback in a complex system feedback processes are embedded in complex systems and influence system behavior feedback describes how a change in an element or relationship often alters others which in turn affect the original one jervis 1998 feedback loops in complex systems can be positive with an increase in one element amplifying a change in the system an agricultural example illustrates how decreased vegetation can increase erosion diminish soil quality may contribute to further vegetative loss erosion and worse soil quality a human systems example of positive feedback is the rate of increase in a viral social media post more people see and share the item it becomes more popular until it reaches its peak feedback loops can also be negative in which the system resists the changes imposed by the input supply and demand economics uses a negative feedback loop as an example of feedback we look at irrigation efficiency as a tool to conserve agricultural water use in the united states public and private institutions funded the development and adoption of irrigation technologies that are more water efficient than current irrigation systems to produce the same amount of food with less water ideally this would slow the depletion of the surface and groundwater resources in the area as recent research has found the new irrigation technologies have resulted in more crop per drop but have not resulted in water conservation because the efficiencies achieved has made it profitable for farmers to expand production onto marginal lands or to switch from low water crops to more water intensive crops ward and pulido velazquez 2008 pfeiffer and lin 2014 the management decision and financial investment did not achieve the desired result because the feedback and nonlinearity in the system was not considered 3 3 emergence and complex adaptive systems in our assessment a key difference between predictable systems simple and complicated systems and complex systems is rooted in the notion and framing of causality also referred to as cause and effect causation etc and conditions for emergence a paradoxical aspect of emergence is the observation of an effect without an easily identifiable and predictable cause an emergent property is a part of a complex system and at the same time it cannot be predicted from the elements of the system it depends on the system because it appears in it and is yet independent from it to a certain degree holland 1998 fromm 2005 as an example of emergence we look at cochabamba bolivia famous for its 2000 water wars in which a popular revolt successfully fought to throw out bechtel corporation and rejected the world bank s privatization scheme for urban water systems in the country the bechtel subsidiary had imposed dramatic price increases overnight that led to protests which escalated and ultimately forced out the company that successful uprisingreturned the water to the control of the state run water system shultz and draper 2008 by analyzing individual element of bolivia s water problem inefficiency of water distribution system water pricing involvement of a private corporation etc emergence of an uprising was not predictable see shultz and draper 2008 bakker 2008 for more details below we explore how emergence and self organization two fundamental components of complex adaptive systems can be used to better understand complex water management problems a self organizing system in the context of complexity science suggests that the whole system is greater than the sum of its elements and their interactions in this conceptualization a system is a macro level entity and an element is a micro level entity simple rules at the micro level may lead to macro level patterns that are emergent but not predictable classic examples frequently come from biology for instance ants micro level entity follow simple rules for interacting with other ants in their immediate vicinity and the cumulative effect of these simple behavioral rules is that they organize into colonies macro level pattern that accomplish tasks such as trailing or building that are beyond the capabilities and awareness of any individual members of the colony one ant with these behaviors will not accomplish any of the ends that the colony achieves the collective action that emerges is qualitatively distinct from any of their individual actions emergence is the process by which lower level interactions among elements integrate to form new levels of organization and pattern the principle of self organization and emergence can be applied descriptively and prescriptively to the management of shared resources such as water ostrom 1990 1993 2009 pioneered influential work applying the frameworks of complexity and self organization to the challenge of managing common pool resources she argued in her work that communities that meet the conditions of a self organizing system can in some cases avoid the tragedy of the commons hardin 1968 we offer two illustrative and diverging examples from california groundwater use in porterville and surface water in the san joaquin valley though residential wells in porterville have gone dry agricultural users have invested drilling up to 10 times the depth to reach deeper water to plant profitable pistachio trees on the other hand in san joaquin valley the fear that the government might intervene and force steep surface water restriction led farmers to voluntarily reduce water use by 25 in exchange for assurance that they would not lose water access later vanek smith 2015 in porterville as water became scarce the effects of supply and demand reward farmers who can access water sufficient to expand their crop with extra profit the farmers are aware that this will ultimately be a self defeating pattern but are caught in the prisoner s dilemma that hardin described hardin 1968 further north the stricter government control of surface water regulations led valley farmers to give up some short term profits in exchange for the longer term collective interest of predictability in this case the higher order system attributes e g protection of water rights and predictability of water availability for the farmers could not be produced by any individual farmer s action the concepts of self organization and emergence are particularly useful in analysis of complex problems when the effects at the level of the system that we want to manage cannot be predicted by the actions of individual elements a self organizing system may be a desirable outcome for water governance particularly when top down governance is not effective or when decision making around collective interests is especially important a self organizing system organizes in response to information and constraints at the local level not from external direction though the external environment may create the conditions for the system to self organize if we could understand these conditions and related mechanisms we might try to facilitate its emergence however because emergence in water systems is inherently unpredictable specific prescriptions of how to initiate self organization must remain contingent ostrom 1993 it is not clear how and under what conditions individual actions turn into collective actions arrow 1951 identified this uncertain nature of social choice actions and his theorem demonstrates the impossibility of pre specification of collective outcomes based on individual preferences for some set of actions ostrom 2009 illustrates how despite the theoretical impossibility of solving these complex social choice problems empirical evidence demonstrates that individual resource users can and do organize to create new institutional arrangements to manage common pool resource ostrom recognized the interdependencies among elements rules configurations of rules and response of variables processes actors and institutions she offered a set of basic design principles found in these self organizing systems ostrom 1990 1993 we suggest these guiding principles to open a conversation around questions of how water professionals can encourage self organization to reframe and perhaps improve water management for boundary crossing water problems by building on key ideas from negotiation theory 4 using negotiation theory to better manage complex water challenges we acknowledge that traditional problem solving frames primarily rooted in the conventional notion of causality are adequate to address simple problems where reasonable scientific certainty and consensus about intervention exists when challenges stem from complex interconnected uncertain unpredictable and boundary crossing system dynamics with feedback traditional frames for problem solving can be limiting or counter productive a recurrent factor for such limitations is that traditional problem solving frames often separate the observation based technical what is from the value based socio political what ought to be dimensions of the problem in the absence of an overarching theory of complexity and contingency we need to explore experiment and adapt calculus and tools from appropriate disciplines that are contingent but rooted in principles that are transparent satisficing and replicable within limits in such exploration and experimentation ideas and tools from multiparty negotiation theory can help us better manage complex water challenges by 1 identifying and engaging relevant stakeholders in decision making 2 exploring and integrating scientific input into political decisions through joint fact finding and 3 generating value creating opportunities and options the mutual gains approach mga to multiparty negotiation offers a way of dealing with disagreements involving many parties concerned about numerous issues who often have very different levels of technical experience and skill susskind 2014 we describe three key ideas from negotiation theory that can help water managers deal with complex disputes more effectively 4 1 stakeholder identification and engagement there are numerous benefits to engaging stakeholders in water management decisions effective stakeholder engagement tends to improve the quality and durability of agreements dietz and stern 2008 innes and booher 1999 susskind and cruikshank 1987 even when agreement is not reached stakeholder engagement can lead to a better understanding of the implicit conflicts due to competing stakeholder interests increased political buy in and legitimacy for decisions better relationships and more trust among contending parties identification of mutually advantageous proposals and learning that has value beyond the process of direct consultation innes and booher 1999 connick and innes 2003 a critical first step to ensuring good stakeholder engagement is to have someone usually a professional facilitator assessor confidentially interview those likely to be directly affected by the policy program or project being considered this is usually followed by the same interviewer meeting with a second set of potential stakeholders suggested by the first group the product of these interviews ought to be a written description of all the categories of stakeholders their priority concerns and suggestions regarding individuals who might be invited to participate in an organized group consultation to speak for each group this report to those with the formal authority to act is called a stakeholder assessment susskind et al 1999 thus water managers and policymakers need to determine a who are the stakeholders b what are their interests and are they clearly defined c how will stakeholders be represented at the table d is there a credible agreement on the relevant scientific and technical findings facts and forecasts e is there agreement on the values that ought to come into play the type of problem being considered number and range of stakeholders affected and the diversity of their values and interests will all impact the design of an appropriate stakeholder engagement strategy 4 1 1 different types of decision problems require different levels of engagement structured problems may best be approached through an advisory committee type process that allows a small group of stakeholders selected by a relevant government agency to familiarize themselves with the issues and respond to whatever questions the agency is puzzling over if there is disagreement over scientific matters but high agreement over values and norms moderately structured problems fig 2 a substantial joint fact finding effort section 4 2 may be appropriate such problems are likely to require a preliminary stakeholder assessment to be sure that all the relevant groups are invited to participate a problem with a wider gap between stakeholders interests and values but with general agreement on the science will require a different kind of consultation with even broader inclusion at the negotiating table to account for divergent views on how decisions should be made joint fact finding and greater reliance on expert advice won t settle such disagreements instead there is almost always a need for multiple rounds of meetings and facilitated problem solving finally for unstructured problems where values interests and tools are all contested an approach to engagement that allows for extensive dialogue mutual learning and the building of trust among stakeholders is required this means that a preliminary stakeholder assessment joint fact finding and facilitated collaborative problem solving are all necessary for example estimating the costs and benefits of a proposed irrigation project even if it crosses municipal boundaries is a structured problem there is likely to be both general agreement on the underlying science and how costs and benefits in such situations should be calculated involving local water users in reviewing such an analysis is crucial but publishing a draft of a report prepared by technical staff before it is finalized may be sufficient to garner adequate stakeholder response deciding how to deal with increased used of desalinized water for multiple uses is a moderately structured management problem there is likely to be more disagreement about the underlying science and the likely effects of continued desalination on the ecosystem in these situations joint fact finding can help the stakeholders understand the sources of uncertainty any decision about what action to be taken may be contested but the underlying legal and cultural basis for decision making is likely to be accepted by almost all the parties when there is strong disagreement among many stakeholders over who should decide or how a decision ought to be made to address a particular problem the situation moves into the upper right hand quadrant in fig 2 for example when multiple states share a river but there is no agreement among them regarding the amount of water each has a right to abstract each year the situation is complex not just in terms of technical questions but also in terms of who has the right to use how much water here the fundamental basis for decision making is contested scientific tools and values tend to intermix making the problem complex the most complex water management problems are those in which there is strong disagreement about the underlying scientific dynamics of the socio ecological systems involved as well as the values interests or legal principles that ought to come into play consider how recent ocean warming has made it possible to reach newly open water in the central arctic there are no existing treaties governing the newly opened ocean the law of the sea covers only a small portion of the area both maritime and non maritime states claim that they should have access to the fisheries and oil and gas resources in the arctic ocean it is not clear what principles or governance mechanisms should be used to resolve these conflicting claims the arctic council an ad hoc organization created by several arctic nations has no international legal basis for the policies it would like to impose nor is there agreement on how 1 climate change may alter access to the area or 2 what fisheries or oil and gas resources are present in areas that were formerly inaccessible in this unstructured realm where both science and norms are contested new joint fact finding approaches and collaborative problem solving are most appropriate 4 2 joint fact finding joint fact finding jff brings experts policymakers and stakeholders together to analyze scientific or technical data and try to draw conclusions instead of each party or participant generating evidence or arguments to support their prior assumptions and political interests the stakeholders jointly select one or more qualified advisors to help them sort through various sources of evidence this increases the chances that science will not be pushed aside in favor of politically convenient arguments favored by the most politically powerful parties jff requires face to face dialogue and movement toward consensus by continually narrowing areas of scientific disagreement mccreary et al 2001 it usually precedes or is part of a larger collaborative decision making process in which the results are agreements in the form of recommendations to elected or appointed decision makers jff can also be a helpful way to build trust and enhance relationships among parties even those who have a long history of disagreement and mistrust ehrmann and stinson 1999 this is sometimes key to the success of subsequent joint problem solving efforts in some instances a decision making body may decide to commission a technical study such as an environmental impact assessment under most circumstances an agency chooses the consultant it favors and becomes the client for the assessment when such studies are re framed as opportunities for jff however the agency seeks the input of all the parties following a stakeholder assessment in both selecting the experts to do the forecasting or analysis the parties are engaged throughout the process not only in responding or reacting after the study has been completed parties may choose to conduct a jff process even after an agency has commissioned an environmental impact assessment in the traditional way this can help ensure that the public and the stakeholder groups that are most concerned have confidence in the assessment or forecast being used as a basis for decision making matsuura and schenk 2017 jff following an agency study doesn t need to duplicate all the earlier work but it does need to sort through disagreements over the way forecasting was done or analyses were interpreted the goal again is to narrow disagreements among the parties on technical assumptions and interpretations before the agency draws on the results to justify policy choices in march 2016 as an illustrative example of how jff may help ethiopia and sudan signed a declaration of principles dop on the grand ethiopian renaissance dam gerd signaling a concrete expression of the three parties desire to move beyond political posturing and previous threats regarding the often contentious discussion of how water is shared and utilized in the eastern nile basin as we have argued water stress in africa and in the middle east particularly in the nile basin is likely to lead to a range of conflicts more importantly complexity of transboundary water sharing needs learning from other basins and adapting to local situations by creating mutually beneficial options islam and susskind 2015 moving forward from the signing of the dop there are opportunities to make this initial cooperation into lasting water security for the nile there are also many potential pitfalls that may lead to renewed enmity between parties while there has been many optimistic and pessimistic speculations in regional and international press on what the dop means there is a void of suggestion on what to do next regardless of whether this dop is representative of the willingness for political compromise or the beginning of a clear and productive relationship this declaration cannot achieve much without further informed conversation and clarification to hammer out the details to act and move forward an agreement on how to develop and share the nile waters for an equitable and sustainable future for the region this declaration has different meaning to champions critics and pragmatists champions argue that this is a new beginning that builds on the principles of cooperation recognizes and respects the development equity and sustainability concerns of the three countries and diminishes the possibility of military conflicts critics question the absence of any mention of earlier water treaties and the related water security implications for egypt and sudan pragmatists express that it binds three countries with two principles from international law not to cause significant harm in utilizing the nile and prioritizing equitable and reasonable use of this shared resource irrespective of these views one point is clear this signing will not instantly change or reduce the complexity of nile water issues that were shaped by the histories myths and mistrusts among nile nations and cultures for centuries this declaration however opens the door for a new beginning and jff may help in this regard jff will not reveal an incontestable truth in the case of the nile river for example no amount of joint fact finding will make it fully certain how much water egypt and sudan can count on from the nile while the grand ethiopian renaissance dam gerd is being filled the gerd is the largest dam ever built in africa ethiopia needs to decide how quickly it will fill the dam if ethiopia fills the dam too quickly the amount of water continuing on to the high aswan dam egypt s primary source of water for almost all uses will be seriously constrained estimates of the impact of filling the gerd rest on a range of subjective judgments including how much water will be available in the nile how quickly to fill it etc in the end especially after a jff process generates forecasts under a range of assumptions participants will have an appreciation why and how forecasts are contingent on subjective judgments while more scientific analysis will not completely eliminate the uncertainties involved jff can produce a more sophisticated understanding of contingent results for which there is scientific consensus and distinguish it from claims that do not have a defensible scientific basis due to the uncertainty inherent in real world situations schenk 2017 suggests that the best we can hope to achieve through joint fact finding is to identify facts for now and facts for use facts for now are contextually appropriate specific and more or less ephemeral schenk 2017 and recognize the changing nature of many complex situations along with the need for adaptive management informed by continuous monitoring data collection and analysis facts for use include information or forecasts that stakeholders can use to make decisions these facts may be imperfect but are bracketed appropriately to take into account different types of uncertainty and the impact of subjective judgments to allow action to proceed the end goal of joint fact finding is to arrive at an agreed upon understanding that is both scientifically sound and publicly credible so that stakeholders and decision makers can then move on to collaborative problem solving karl et al 2007 jff when organized properly makes it explicit about what is knowable objectively and what needs to be discussed subjectively susskind and cruikshank 1987 ehrmann and stinson 1999 schenk et al 2016 4 2 1 essential steps of joint fact finding specifically jff involves six essential steps described in fig 3 step 1 assess the need for jff the decision making agency or group of agencies decides whether or not there is a scientific or technical issue that requires more clarity and if so takes on the role of the convener the convener helps identify stakeholders calls meetings and provides financial and sometimes technical support throughout the process this should be managed by a professional facilitator to establish a neutral and inclusive process the facilitator should conduct a pre jff assessment that identifies the stakeholders information and knowledge gaps and stakeholders incentives to participate in jff step 2 convene the stakeholders if the convener and facilitator decide that jff would be valuable they convene a representative group of stakeholders based on the results of step 1 the facilitator helps this group draft ground rules roles responsibilities and a timeline the group generates general scientific or technical questions that they would like to address through jff with the help of agreed upon technical advisors independent of the convening agency staff step 3 define the scope of the study the group defines the scope and objectives of the jff effort and translates general questions into a small number of precise research questions by the end of this stage the group should agree on i key research questions ii the analytic methods to be used to answer those questions iii the type of expert advice required for analysis and interpretation and iv a timeframe for the work to be completed susskind et al 2017 step 4 conduct the jff study the representative group defines the sources of data e g indigenous quantitative qualitative etc that should be included before their expert advisors conduct the study step 5 evaluate the results of the study afterwards the experts communicate their findings to the representative group identify any remaining sources of uncertainty and discuss their confidence in their findings these results are combined into a single technical report assuming the stakeholders understand and accept the results of the studies they can use the findings to continue a joint problem solving effort aimed at generating policy recommendations for the convening agency step 6 communicate the results of the jff process in the final step stakeholder representatives communicate the findings of their jff effort to the broader public and to policymakers if appropriate this becomes the first step in a longer consensus building or problem solving process in which the full group of stakeholders has an opportunity to collaborate with the jff task force in developing a final set of policy recommendations an example of joint fact finding facilitated by concur inc involving the guadalupe river flood control project collaborative illustrates how a large number of stakeholders avoided adversarial legal proceedings and instead jointly agreed upon project objectives and performance criteria karl et al 2007 the focus was how to resolve disagreements over flood mitigation for the lower guadalupe river in downtown san jose in california mutually agreed upon experts evaluated alternatives based on chosen criteria objectives metrics and indicators and worked with stakeholders to explain their findings the multi year process informed stakeholders balanced technical and financial disparities and created an acceptable management strategy at the collaborative s final meeting one of the environmental group s attorneys withdraw their citizen suit the agreement on project redesign produced efficiency gains that cut 100 million from the original mitigation project cost relationships were improved and the first agreement was followed by an ongoing collaborative adaptive management effort 4 3 creating value through the generation of mutually advantageous options historically most water negotiations assume a fixed quantity of water based on an average of past water levels over a chosen time period for example the 1959 nile agreement on the full utilization of the nile waters assumed that a fixed amount of water 84 bcm would be allocated between egypt 55 5 bcm and sudan 18 5 bcm when the parties assume a fixed amount of water in a particular location it is easy to further assume that negotiations must take a zero sum format this outlook often leads to hard bargaining or a test of will and drives out the possibility of cooperation or the invention of mutually advantageous outcomes mga style negotiation involves all sides looking for opportunities to reach an agreement that is mutually beneficial susskind 2014 it requires parties to think of options in which each gets their most important interests met in exchange for helping the other side s to achieve their top priorities for example if one side is mostly concerned about having more water in the dry season they don t necessarily need an overall increase in their share of the total supply for the whole year they just need a guarantee that they will have more water during drier months the other side might have more storage capacity and could promise to release a substantial amount of water during the dry season while retaining its annual overall share of the total supply they might jointly invest in new infrastructure to make such an agreement work this kind of integrative solution to meeting the interests of the two sides requires trust and cooperation the goal of a mga is to reach a negotiated agreement that is more beneficial to both sides than what each might expect if there were no agreement or each pursued their own interests unilaterally 4 3 1 value creation in boundary crossing water disputes in the case of boundary crossing water negotiation value creation may occur in several ways first by redefining the issues on the agenda i e scale scope number etc second by creating more water and third by recognizing the full bundle of benefits sometimes on a range of related issues that could be gained by new levels of cooperation value creation may be achieved by increasing the scale or scope of water management usually a watershed is taken as the unit of planning to achieve optimal water use increasing the scale of water planning however beyond the boundaries of a watershed can allow parties to incorporate additional issues into their negotiation such as water for agricultural production energy production and domestic use in neighboring watersheds adding issues to the agenda makes it easier to find packages that are mutually advantageous for example a country might invest in a hydroelectric dam in a neighboring country in exchange for discounted electricity considering multiple issues simultaneously is often the key to value creation in boundary crossing water negotiations grzybowski et al 2010 however when governance boundaries and hydrologic boundaries don t overlap implementation problems arise this means that negotiated agreements if the scope of the discussion broadens may require creation of new institutional arrangements the water diplomacy framework suggests that value creation requires thinking about and managing water as a flexible not a fixed resource susskind and islam 2012 islam and susskind 2013 there are several ways of creating more water by treating water as a flexible resource for example through reclassification of water for different purposes investment in new technology or more efficient water usage distinguishing between blue and green water or through recognition of virtual water allan 2011 one such example of creating flexibility through mga is found in israel and jordan s 1994 peace treaty jordan had no water storage capability on its side israel agreed to store water for jordan in lake tiberius during the wet season and release it to jordan during the dry season israel also agreed to help construct new transport infrastructure to reduce water loss en route to jordan israel got the peace treaty it wanted while jordan found a way to meet its water needs during the dry season for more details please see susskind and islam 2012 clearly more expanded discussion with case studies would help us make a stronger argument about the applicability of wdf within the context of complexity science and negotiation theory however given the limited space requirement of this journal we refer to the range of case studies we have compiled on how to resolve water conflicts using complexity science negotiation theory and water diplomacy framework as described in detail in several papers and books e g ibrahim and islam 2017 pohl and swain 2017 islam and madani 2017 choudnury and islam 2018 aquapedia http aquapedia waterdiplomacy org we also refer to six blog pieces that describe several case studies discussed in this paper http blog waterdiplomacy org 2015 08 water diplomacy issues of complexity science and negotiation theory 5 concluding remarks many of our current and emerging water governance and managementissues are complex case examples like those discussed above from bolivia california egypt israel and jordan illustrate how complexity manifests in water management these real world examples exhibit attributes of complex systems through their interconnected nature feedback and emergent patterns for many of our water problems interconnectedness is accelerating often they seem to entail impenetrable webs of cause and effect in such situations instead of looking at systems in isolation i e rather than looking at elements focus on interactions and interdependencies among elements insights from complexity science prompts us to step back and look at how elements interact to create emergent patterns unexpected patterns will continue to emerge and we will not know where the next one will come from and how it will affect water access allocation and use this of course means that all water agreements need to be adaptable to a changing and unpredictable future embracing these concepts from complexity science will require rethinking and reframing of some basic assumptions about water management including moving away from politically convenient boundary setting that ignores system interconnections adopting contingent and easily modifiable water sharing agreements that emphasize adjustments to uncertainty and feedback and building stronger relationships among involved parties so that joint problem solving in the face of emergent patterns is easier our challenge is to prepare and design natural societal and engineered systems that are able to recover quickly from unexpected events and adapt to the constantly changing nature of complex systems insights from complexity science may be helpful in this regard complex water systems are neither random nor perfectly predictable it is the recognition of the balance between degree of flexibility too much flexibility among interacting elements make the system random and constraints a highly constrained set of interacting elements may make the system simple and predictable but vulnerable to unexpected event may help in addressing complex water issues to analyze complex systems can be decomposed in many different ways e g choice of number of elements and their nature of interactions in addressing water use among alfalfa and almonds and their relationships with the economy and other use of water in california and the insights gained by different decomposition will be different all decompositions however are not equally valid or relevant in fact decomposition is a choice and it has consequences more importantly this choice is contingent for a given problem context this is where negotiated choice of decomposition becomes an essential component of understanding governing and managing complex water systems we will not have complete knowledge of complex systems yet we need to act with limited and uncertain information by choosing a framework such choices however need not be arbitrary admittedly knowledge for complex systems will always remain limited and contingent understanding these limits though can lead to decisions that are neither relativistic nor vague but negotiated through a carefully crafted framework based on a set of agreed upon guiding principles a recurrent factor in traditional problem solving for water management is the separation of what is from what ought to be dimensions of the problem the wdf emphasizes that when dealing with complex problems these dimensions cannot be separated the wdf acknowledges both the limits to knowledge objectivity of observations and subjectivity of interpretation as well as the contingent nature of all action as an effect of complexity furthermore the wdf asserts that parties need to seek consensus on guiding principles and mutual value creation when negotiating a resolution of their differences we hope the combination of ideas and tools illustrated here with the included references will encourage and motivate water professionals to seek to blend insights from complexity science with tools from negotiation theory to address the most pressing complex water problems of our time

7244,many water governance and management issues are complex the complexity of these issues is related to crossing of multiple boundaries political social and jurisdictional as well as physical ecological and biogeochemical resolution of these issues usually requires interactions of many parties with conflicting values and interests operating across multiple boundaries and scales to make decisions the interdependence and feedback among interacting variables processes actors and institutions are hard to model and difficult to forecast thus decision making related to complex water problems needs be contingent and adaptive this paper draws on a number of ideas from complexity science and negotiation theory that may make it easier to cope with the complexities and difficulties of managing boundary crossing water disputes it begins with the water diplomacy framework that was developed and tested over the past several years then it uses three key ideas from complexity science interdependence and interconnectedness uncertainty and feedback emergence and adaptation and three from negotiation theory stakeholder identification and engagement joint fact finding and value creation through option generation to show how application of these ideas can help enhance effectiveness of water management keywords complexity water diplomacy negotiation 1 introduction are we running out of water will water scarcity lead to war is water an economic good for some the answer to these questions may be absolutely yes and some will emphatically insist the opposite yet many will argue that the answer to each question is it depends of course it depends but on what why and how do we get yes and no answers for the same question for simple problems where cause effect relationships are well understood this search for yes no solution works very well however for complex problems clear cut solutions do not exist can we address the supply demand gap through the lens of water scarcity can we provide access to water in urban settlements through the lens of water security can we develop adaptation and mitigation strategies for a changing climate through the lens of sustainability what do these problems have in common and what makes them complex when we can t answer these questions with certainty how should we proceed this paper introduces three foundational ideas from complexity science and three from negotiation theory that can make it easier to resolve complex water management problems in spite of the uncertainty posed by almost all boundary crossing water management situations we begin by summarizing the water diplomacy framework islam and susskind 2013 we will then show how key ideas from complexity science and negotiation theory when used to augment the water diplomacy framework can make it easier for water professionals to manage water resource more effectively 2 water diplomacy framework water as a limited resource lends itself to conflicts over how it should be allocated and managed the origin of many complex water problems is a result of interconnections and feedback among variables processes actors and institutions efforts to manage water with an eye toward immediate needs and long term sustainability will involve many actors and institutions with competing interests and values who demand or expect to be involved in decisions about how resources will be managed effective resolution of conflicting values and interests especially when knowledge of both natural and human systems is uncertain will require new dispute resolution and collective decision making methods the water diplomacy framework wdf is an alternative to the traditional techno or values focused approaches to water governance and management islam and susskind 2013 islam and repella 2015 the wdf starts by asking who decides who gets water and how the wdf aims to understand and resolve water related problems it acknowledges that traditional problem solving frames are adequate to address simple problems where reasonable scientific certainty and consensus about intervention exists fig 1 the wdf hypothesizes that when water challenges stem from complex interconnected uncertain unpredictable and boundary crossing system dynamics with feedback traditional frames for problem solving can be limiting or counter productive a recurrent factor for such limitations is that traditional problem solving frames often separate the observation based technical what is from the value based socio political what ought to be dimensions of the problem the wdf further hypothesizes that when dealing with complex problems these dimensions cannot be de coupled the wdf acknowledges both the limits to knowledge objectivity of observations and subjectivity of interpretation and the contingent nature of our action the wdf actively seeks value creating options and opportunities to allow conflicting interests to be addressed in a sustainable way and begins by focusing on know why before prescribing know how islam and repella 2015 in other words the wdf builds on the differences among those with contending values and interests and seeks to engage representatives of these interests in technical and political problem solving to arrive at a mutually agreeable negotiated resolution the wdf is based on credible scientific knowledge mediated through equity and sustainability as guiding principles for contextual policy action the wdf approach emphasizes that when addressing complex water problems all parties have a legitimate right to have a voice about the evidence used and its interpretation the past evidence and future implications of an intervention metrics of equity and sustainability and the package of actionable solutions these parties include users and producers of water knowledge managers technical experts policy makers decision makers and politicians furthermore the wdf asserts that parties need to seek consensus on guiding principles and mutual value creation when negotiating a resolution 3 using complexity science to better understand the nature of water problems historically we have taken nature apart and analyzed its components in ever increasing detail this mode of analysis design and engineering works well for simple systems in which cause effect relationships are well understood complex problems are those where cause effect relationships are ambiguous uncertainty nonlinearity and feedback are inherent and emergent properties e g holland 1998 pahl wostl 2004 fromm 2005 islam and susskind 2013 section 3 3 for more details on emergence dominate the system evolution fig 1 for this class of problems there is likely to be very little agreement about what the definition or cause of the problem is let alone the best way to resolve it furthermore complex problems are constantly in flux because of natural societal and political dynamics continued use of traditional systems engineering approaches to address complex problems is likely to provide doubtful outcomes kauffmann 1993 barabási and bonabeau 2003 pahl wostl et al 2007 miller and page 2007 islam and susskind 2013 many complex water management problems lie somewhere between certainty uncertainty and consensus no consensus spectrum islam and susskind 2013 the dynamics in this zone of complexity is neither entirely certain nor totally uncertain fig 1 neither the reproducible certainty of science nor and overwhelming consensus for action exists for problems in this zone ideas and tools from complexity science interdependence and interconnectedness uncertainty and feedback emergence and complex adaptive systems may be used to identify the parameters of management problems here pahl wostl 2004 maguire et al 2006 maguire 2011 cilliers et al 2013 islam and susskind 2013 problem solving in this zone is distinct from what works in simple and complicated settings for complex systems cause effect relationships are ambiguous and almost never prospective prediction is not possible with any reasonable degree of certainty nonlinearity and feedback are inherent emergent properties dominate system behavior and response for more details please see snowden and boone 2007 islam and susskind 2013 islam and repella 2015 a failure to appreciate these differences among simple complicated and complex systems could cause us to apply exactly the wrong approach to the right water problem or the right approach to the wrong problem in general continued efforts to refine existing tools like cost benefit analysis and optimization algorithms to address complex problems have not worked e g ackoff 1979 bennis et al 2010 stiglitz et al 2010 while best practices can be used to address simple problems such as the design of a household s water system and systems engineering can be used for complicated problems such as meeting domestic water demand within a water distribution system for a city these tools are not suited for complex problems allocating water for competing and conflicting needs among sectors and uses we can understand and optimize simple and complicated systems by taking them apart and analyzing the details of their cause and effect relationship however for complex systems we do not have similar prospective understanding of cause and effect ideas and tools from negotiation theory stakeholder identification and participation joint fact finding creative options may be used to show how complex water governance and management can be operationalized in practice islam and susskind 2013 we categorize complex problems to be those a that are interconnected with many variables processes actors and institutions b that cross scales domains and boundaries c for which identification of causal connections is nearly impossible and d for which historical records are not very reliable indicators of the future for complex water problems hydrological climatic ecological social and political processes interact nonlinearly with feedback tipping points and thresholds and render identification of an optimal solution virtually impossible over the last several decades complexity science has received increased attention from multiple disciplines e g anderson et al 1988 nicolis and prigogine 1989 lewin 1992 kauffmann 1993 mainzer 1994 bar yam 1997 cilliers 1998 pahl wostl 2004 maguire et al 2006 pahl wostl et al 2007 maguire 2011 cilliers et al 2013 what is usually referred to as complexity science is actually a collection of frameworks theories models and tools from systems engineering chaos theory cybernetics and studies of adaptive systems islam 2017 complex systems by their very nature resist prescriptive diagnosis and this diagnosis is further convoluted by disciplinary jargon for example social scientists often focus on how context specific interactions of actors and institutions create complexity while natural scientists explore how nonlinearity and feedback among variables and processes generate complexity we hope to show how three ideas from complexity science contribute to our understanding of and responses to managing water disputes 3 1 interdependence and interconnectedness complex systems by their very nature cannot be explained by simple cause effect relationships at the heart of a complex system is a collection of interdependent elements variables processes actors and institutions the interactions nonlinearity and feedback among these elements can make the resulting problem definition ambiguous and open to conflicting interpretations in such situations opinion dominates facts and ideology takes over hydrology such issues were highlighted during california s recent drought agricultural industrial and residential users and uses of water received heightened attention in assigning blame for the shortage and identifying places to implement steep water reduction as agriculture is the largest water user various agricultural products received particularly scrutiny alfalfa is the single largest agricultural water user cooley 2015 in the state but as a feed crop is not of primary economic value even as an international export it feeds california cows and california is the top dairy producing state in the nation the value of any crop or other water consuming commodity or service can t be evaluated solely through water in to dollars out comparisons and require understanding the perspectives of and value to the multiple stakeholders for each of these water uses uncertainty about drought duration and intensity further complicates questions about water prioritization and planning conventional solutions that seek to optimize water use in terms of economic value pollution or calories grown per dollar lead to reductive analyses that ignore the interrelationships and second and third order benefits and costs of water uses and proposed solutions these limited analyses and opinions highlight that while many in california see the complex interactions and connections between the interests of domestic industrial agricultural and natural systems stakeholders there are those who hold a singular perspective on the cause and solution to water shortage a networked view of the system described in islam and susskind 2013 surrounding water in california is necessary to both understand and suggest how decisions about sharing water can be made what criteria need to be considered in those decisions and who does the deciding issues intertwine but these interconnections also contribute to opportunities for addressing the water challenges especially regarding agriculture a more comprehensive perspective that relates analysis of agricultural water use to other issue lenses may lead to improved understanding and decision making around water policy almonds and pistachios have similar water use intensity as alfalfa and are among the largest agricultural water users in california cooley 2015 these crops bring in high agricultural revenue and are adapted to the local climate california is the world s largest producer of almonds and the largest u s producer of pistachios taken in context supporting nuts and some fruits may be good uses for agricultural water in california resolving the water crisis will require a substantial shift in agriculture s orientation towards water but california s complex water problem cannot be treated as simply a local agriculture problem given the national and international role of the state s agricultural sector and cultural importance of agriculture within the state complex systems are formed by connections between elements or smaller systems and by virtue of this connectedness a change in one element may create a cascading set of changes among other elements the degree of connectivity varies within and between systems systems with high connectivity experience more cascading effects and systems with low connectivity are more adaptable to change in any one element the hydrological ecological economic and socio political challenges posed above need to be unpacked and the connections among the domains scales and sectors need to be accounted for in problem framing and actions toward problem resolution differences in how complex and interdependent systems take shape also suggest that multiple approaches to problem solving are feasible and will remain contingent on the capacity of the system and constraints imposed by the context however it is not possible make a list of interactions to be exhaustive for complex systems sterman 2000 schlüter et al 2014 bounds must be set to develop an effective model but researchers are challenged to objectively define the scope and scale of such modeling studies additionally coupled models cross disciplines and modelers are unable to point to the theoretical framework of any single discipline to defend the relevant scope srinivasan 2015 one needs to simultaneously balance the scope and level of detail in order to create a parsimonious and communicable model finally critical assessment of models is more challenging when the theories empirical methods and vocabulary drawn upon to create and communicate a model span disciplinary boundaries schlüter et al 2014 garcia et al 2015 a shared understanding of important processes to be included is needed to allow modeling structure scope and detail to remain contingent on and adaptive to the problem context ideas from negotiation theory section 4 provide a way to develop such a shared understanding for the conceptualization of this class of interconnected problems 3 2 uncertainty and feedback our knowledge of real world systems is uncertain we have imperfect information and face a range of unknowns uncertainty manifests in complex water disputes partly because the problem space of the conflict is open in complex water systems it is difficult to plan for possible outcomes when there is no reliable way to forecast the impacts and interactions of changing water supply water quality and various aspects of human and institutional behaviors for example forecasted future flows of the nile river under various climate change scenarios ranged from a 78 decrease to a 30 increase watson et al 1997 recent findings also suggest that climate change could alter inter annual and intra annual variability of the nile flow siam and eltahir 2017 if future flows can t reliably be predicted it will be difficult to anticipate and plan for other dependent factors that impact water security 3 2 1 different faces of uncertainty at its simplest uncertainty describes something that we don t know or know only in an inadequate and imprecise way however how uncertainty is defined or approachedvaries between disciplines some uncertainty can be identified and quantified some can be reduced through gathering more information some can be qualitatively described and some cannot be identified or reduced through any practical means definitions of types of uncertainty range from classification of the source and how it may be reduced to how uncertainty impacts potential actions or outcomes from an event or decision to how perception of uncertainty shapes the decision making process van der sluijs 2005 webster and curry 2011 islam and susskind 2013 we focus on three types of uncertainty susskind and islam 2012 uncertainty of information relates to assigning probabilities to the likelihood of particular events occurring this type of uncertainty ranges from zero in which we are completely confident about the forecasts to intermediate levels which involve events with known probability ranges to high levels of uncertainty in which we have almost no idea about the future uncertainty of action relates to situations where cause effect relationships are not clear such as whether certain policies or programs will produce expected outcome uncertainty of perception occurs when people see what they expect to see rather than what is actually there which can happen when questions are framed in ideological or political terms it is not possible to eliminate uncertainty completely however not all three types are likely to be equally important for a given problem forecasted nile flows may be related to uncertainty of information but given the current state of our scientific knowledge about climate models additional modeling studies will probably not resolve such an uncertainty in the near future yet we need to plan and manage water in the nile basin policy makers and planners can use the uncertainty to generate opportunities for value creation periodic reassessment in light of new data and findings may be used to adapt and ensure desirable outcomes moreover it is important to undertake these scientific analyses together as joint fact finding section 4 1 to define the scope of the analysis relevant to particular problem context 3 2 2 feedback in a complex system feedback processes are embedded in complex systems and influence system behavior feedback describes how a change in an element or relationship often alters others which in turn affect the original one jervis 1998 feedback loops in complex systems can be positive with an increase in one element amplifying a change in the system an agricultural example illustrates how decreased vegetation can increase erosion diminish soil quality may contribute to further vegetative loss erosion and worse soil quality a human systems example of positive feedback is the rate of increase in a viral social media post more people see and share the item it becomes more popular until it reaches its peak feedback loops can also be negative in which the system resists the changes imposed by the input supply and demand economics uses a negative feedback loop as an example of feedback we look at irrigation efficiency as a tool to conserve agricultural water use in the united states public and private institutions funded the development and adoption of irrigation technologies that are more water efficient than current irrigation systems to produce the same amount of food with less water ideally this would slow the depletion of the surface and groundwater resources in the area as recent research has found the new irrigation technologies have resulted in more crop per drop but have not resulted in water conservation because the efficiencies achieved has made it profitable for farmers to expand production onto marginal lands or to switch from low water crops to more water intensive crops ward and pulido velazquez 2008 pfeiffer and lin 2014 the management decision and financial investment did not achieve the desired result because the feedback and nonlinearity in the system was not considered 3 3 emergence and complex adaptive systems in our assessment a key difference between predictable systems simple and complicated systems and complex systems is rooted in the notion and framing of causality also referred to as cause and effect causation etc and conditions for emergence a paradoxical aspect of emergence is the observation of an effect without an easily identifiable and predictable cause an emergent property is a part of a complex system and at the same time it cannot be predicted from the elements of the system it depends on the system because it appears in it and is yet independent from it to a certain degree holland 1998 fromm 2005 as an example of emergence we look at cochabamba bolivia famous for its 2000 water wars in which a popular revolt successfully fought to throw out bechtel corporation and rejected the world bank s privatization scheme for urban water systems in the country the bechtel subsidiary had imposed dramatic price increases overnight that led to protests which escalated and ultimately forced out the company that successful uprisingreturned the water to the control of the state run water system shultz and draper 2008 by analyzing individual element of bolivia s water problem inefficiency of water distribution system water pricing involvement of a private corporation etc emergence of an uprising was not predictable see shultz and draper 2008 bakker 2008 for more details below we explore how emergence and self organization two fundamental components of complex adaptive systems can be used to better understand complex water management problems a self organizing system in the context of complexity science suggests that the whole system is greater than the sum of its elements and their interactions in this conceptualization a system is a macro level entity and an element is a micro level entity simple rules at the micro level may lead to macro level patterns that are emergent but not predictable classic examples frequently come from biology for instance ants micro level entity follow simple rules for interacting with other ants in their immediate vicinity and the cumulative effect of these simple behavioral rules is that they organize into colonies macro level pattern that accomplish tasks such as trailing or building that are beyond the capabilities and awareness of any individual members of the colony one ant with these behaviors will not accomplish any of the ends that the colony achieves the collective action that emerges is qualitatively distinct from any of their individual actions emergence is the process by which lower level interactions among elements integrate to form new levels of organization and pattern the principle of self organization and emergence can be applied descriptively and prescriptively to the management of shared resources such as water ostrom 1990 1993 2009 pioneered influential work applying the frameworks of complexity and self organization to the challenge of managing common pool resources she argued in her work that communities that meet the conditions of a self organizing system can in some cases avoid the tragedy of the commons hardin 1968 we offer two illustrative and diverging examples from california groundwater use in porterville and surface water in the san joaquin valley though residential wells in porterville have gone dry agricultural users have invested drilling up to 10 times the depth to reach deeper water to plant profitable pistachio trees on the other hand in san joaquin valley the fear that the government might intervene and force steep surface water restriction led farmers to voluntarily reduce water use by 25 in exchange for assurance that they would not lose water access later vanek smith 2015 in porterville as water became scarce the effects of supply and demand reward farmers who can access water sufficient to expand their crop with extra profit the farmers are aware that this will ultimately be a self defeating pattern but are caught in the prisoner s dilemma that hardin described hardin 1968 further north the stricter government control of surface water regulations led valley farmers to give up some short term profits in exchange for the longer term collective interest of predictability in this case the higher order system attributes e g protection of water rights and predictability of water availability for the farmers could not be produced by any individual farmer s action the concepts of self organization and emergence are particularly useful in analysis of complex problems when the effects at the level of the system that we want to manage cannot be predicted by the actions of individual elements a self organizing system may be a desirable outcome for water governance particularly when top down governance is not effective or when decision making around collective interests is especially important a self organizing system organizes in response to information and constraints at the local level not from external direction though the external environment may create the conditions for the system to self organize if we could understand these conditions and related mechanisms we might try to facilitate its emergence however because emergence in water systems is inherently unpredictable specific prescriptions of how to initiate self organization must remain contingent ostrom 1993 it is not clear how and under what conditions individual actions turn into collective actions arrow 1951 identified this uncertain nature of social choice actions and his theorem demonstrates the impossibility of pre specification of collective outcomes based on individual preferences for some set of actions ostrom 2009 illustrates how despite the theoretical impossibility of solving these complex social choice problems empirical evidence demonstrates that individual resource users can and do organize to create new institutional arrangements to manage common pool resource ostrom recognized the interdependencies among elements rules configurations of rules and response of variables processes actors and institutions she offered a set of basic design principles found in these self organizing systems ostrom 1990 1993 we suggest these guiding principles to open a conversation around questions of how water professionals can encourage self organization to reframe and perhaps improve water management for boundary crossing water problems by building on key ideas from negotiation theory 4 using negotiation theory to better manage complex water challenges we acknowledge that traditional problem solving frames primarily rooted in the conventional notion of causality are adequate to address simple problems where reasonable scientific certainty and consensus about intervention exists when challenges stem from complex interconnected uncertain unpredictable and boundary crossing system dynamics with feedback traditional frames for problem solving can be limiting or counter productive a recurrent factor for such limitations is that traditional problem solving frames often separate the observation based technical what is from the value based socio political what ought to be dimensions of the problem in the absence of an overarching theory of complexity and contingency we need to explore experiment and adapt calculus and tools from appropriate disciplines that are contingent but rooted in principles that are transparent satisficing and replicable within limits in such exploration and experimentation ideas and tools from multiparty negotiation theory can help us better manage complex water challenges by 1 identifying and engaging relevant stakeholders in decision making 2 exploring and integrating scientific input into political decisions through joint fact finding and 3 generating value creating opportunities and options the mutual gains approach mga to multiparty negotiation offers a way of dealing with disagreements involving many parties concerned about numerous issues who often have very different levels of technical experience and skill susskind 2014 we describe three key ideas from negotiation theory that can help water managers deal with complex disputes more effectively 4 1 stakeholder identification and engagement there are numerous benefits to engaging stakeholders in water management decisions effective stakeholder engagement tends to improve the quality and durability of agreements dietz and stern 2008 innes and booher 1999 susskind and cruikshank 1987 even when agreement is not reached stakeholder engagement can lead to a better understanding of the implicit conflicts due to competing stakeholder interests increased political buy in and legitimacy for decisions better relationships and more trust among contending parties identification of mutually advantageous proposals and learning that has value beyond the process of direct consultation innes and booher 1999 connick and innes 2003 a critical first step to ensuring good stakeholder engagement is to have someone usually a professional facilitator assessor confidentially interview those likely to be directly affected by the policy program or project being considered this is usually followed by the same interviewer meeting with a second set of potential stakeholders suggested by the first group the product of these interviews ought to be a written description of all the categories of stakeholders their priority concerns and suggestions regarding individuals who might be invited to participate in an organized group consultation to speak for each group this report to those with the formal authority to act is called a stakeholder assessment susskind et al 1999 thus water managers and policymakers need to determine a who are the stakeholders b what are their interests and are they clearly defined c how will stakeholders be represented at the table d is there a credible agreement on the relevant scientific and technical findings facts and forecasts e is there agreement on the values that ought to come into play the type of problem being considered number and range of stakeholders affected and the diversity of their values and interests will all impact the design of an appropriate stakeholder engagement strategy 4 1 1 different types of decision problems require different levels of engagement structured problems may best be approached through an advisory committee type process that allows a small group of stakeholders selected by a relevant government agency to familiarize themselves with the issues and respond to whatever questions the agency is puzzling over if there is disagreement over scientific matters but high agreement over values and norms moderately structured problems fig 2 a substantial joint fact finding effort section 4 2 may be appropriate such problems are likely to require a preliminary stakeholder assessment to be sure that all the relevant groups are invited to participate a problem with a wider gap between stakeholders interests and values but with general agreement on the science will require a different kind of consultation with even broader inclusion at the negotiating table to account for divergent views on how decisions should be made joint fact finding and greater reliance on expert advice won t settle such disagreements instead there is almost always a need for multiple rounds of meetings and facilitated problem solving finally for unstructured problems where values interests and tools are all contested an approach to engagement that allows for extensive dialogue mutual learning and the building of trust among stakeholders is required this means that a preliminary stakeholder assessment joint fact finding and facilitated collaborative problem solving are all necessary for example estimating the costs and benefits of a proposed irrigation project even if it crosses municipal boundaries is a structured problem there is likely to be both general agreement on the underlying science and how costs and benefits in such situations should be calculated involving local water users in reviewing such an analysis is crucial but publishing a draft of a report prepared by technical staff before it is finalized may be sufficient to garner adequate stakeholder response deciding how to deal with increased used of desalinized water for multiple uses is a moderately structured management problem there is likely to be more disagreement about the underlying science and the likely effects of continued desalination on the ecosystem in these situations joint fact finding can help the stakeholders understand the sources of uncertainty any decision about what action to be taken may be contested but the underlying legal and cultural basis for decision making is likely to be accepted by almost all the parties when there is strong disagreement among many stakeholders over who should decide or how a decision ought to be made to address a particular problem the situation moves into the upper right hand quadrant in fig 2 for example when multiple states share a river but there is no agreement among them regarding the amount of water each has a right to abstract each year the situation is complex not just in terms of technical questions but also in terms of who has the right to use how much water here the fundamental basis for decision making is contested scientific tools and values tend to intermix making the problem complex the most complex water management problems are those in which there is strong disagreement about the underlying scientific dynamics of the socio ecological systems involved as well as the values interests or legal principles that ought to come into play consider how recent ocean warming has made it possible to reach newly open water in the central arctic there are no existing treaties governing the newly opened ocean the law of the sea covers only a small portion of the area both maritime and non maritime states claim that they should have access to the fisheries and oil and gas resources in the arctic ocean it is not clear what principles or governance mechanisms should be used to resolve these conflicting claims the arctic council an ad hoc organization created by several arctic nations has no international legal basis for the policies it would like to impose nor is there agreement on how 1 climate change may alter access to the area or 2 what fisheries or oil and gas resources are present in areas that were formerly inaccessible in this unstructured realm where both science and norms are contested new joint fact finding approaches and collaborative problem solving are most appropriate 4 2 joint fact finding joint fact finding jff brings experts policymakers and stakeholders together to analyze scientific or technical data and try to draw conclusions instead of each party or participant generating evidence or arguments to support their prior assumptions and political interests the stakeholders jointly select one or more qualified advisors to help them sort through various sources of evidence this increases the chances that science will not be pushed aside in favor of politically convenient arguments favored by the most politically powerful parties jff requires face to face dialogue and movement toward consensus by continually narrowing areas of scientific disagreement mccreary et al 2001 it usually precedes or is part of a larger collaborative decision making process in which the results are agreements in the form of recommendations to elected or appointed decision makers jff can also be a helpful way to build trust and enhance relationships among parties even those who have a long history of disagreement and mistrust ehrmann and stinson 1999 this is sometimes key to the success of subsequent joint problem solving efforts in some instances a decision making body may decide to commission a technical study such as an environmental impact assessment under most circumstances an agency chooses the consultant it favors and becomes the client for the assessment when such studies are re framed as opportunities for jff however the agency seeks the input of all the parties following a stakeholder assessment in both selecting the experts to do the forecasting or analysis the parties are engaged throughout the process not only in responding or reacting after the study has been completed parties may choose to conduct a jff process even after an agency has commissioned an environmental impact assessment in the traditional way this can help ensure that the public and the stakeholder groups that are most concerned have confidence in the assessment or forecast being used as a basis for decision making matsuura and schenk 2017 jff following an agency study doesn t need to duplicate all the earlier work but it does need to sort through disagreements over the way forecasting was done or analyses were interpreted the goal again is to narrow disagreements among the parties on technical assumptions and interpretations before the agency draws on the results to justify policy choices in march 2016 as an illustrative example of how jff may help ethiopia and sudan signed a declaration of principles dop on the grand ethiopian renaissance dam gerd signaling a concrete expression of the three parties desire to move beyond political posturing and previous threats regarding the often contentious discussion of how water is shared and utilized in the eastern nile basin as we have argued water stress in africa and in the middle east particularly in the nile basin is likely to lead to a range of conflicts more importantly complexity of transboundary water sharing needs learning from other basins and adapting to local situations by creating mutually beneficial options islam and susskind 2015 moving forward from the signing of the dop there are opportunities to make this initial cooperation into lasting water security for the nile there are also many potential pitfalls that may lead to renewed enmity between parties while there has been many optimistic and pessimistic speculations in regional and international press on what the dop means there is a void of suggestion on what to do next regardless of whether this dop is representative of the willingness for political compromise or the beginning of a clear and productive relationship this declaration cannot achieve much without further informed conversation and clarification to hammer out the details to act and move forward an agreement on how to develop and share the nile waters for an equitable and sustainable future for the region this declaration has different meaning to champions critics and pragmatists champions argue that this is a new beginning that builds on the principles of cooperation recognizes and respects the development equity and sustainability concerns of the three countries and diminishes the possibility of military conflicts critics question the absence of any mention of earlier water treaties and the related water security implications for egypt and sudan pragmatists express that it binds three countries with two principles from international law not to cause significant harm in utilizing the nile and prioritizing equitable and reasonable use of this shared resource irrespective of these views one point is clear this signing will not instantly change or reduce the complexity of nile water issues that were shaped by the histories myths and mistrusts among nile nations and cultures for centuries this declaration however opens the door for a new beginning and jff may help in this regard jff will not reveal an incontestable truth in the case of the nile river for example no amount of joint fact finding will make it fully certain how much water egypt and sudan can count on from the nile while the grand ethiopian renaissance dam gerd is being filled the gerd is the largest dam ever built in africa ethiopia needs to decide how quickly it will fill the dam if ethiopia fills the dam too quickly the amount of water continuing on to the high aswan dam egypt s primary source of water for almost all uses will be seriously constrained estimates of the impact of filling the gerd rest on a range of subjective judgments including how much water will be available in the nile how quickly to fill it etc in the end especially after a jff process generates forecasts under a range of assumptions participants will have an appreciation why and how forecasts are contingent on subjective judgments while more scientific analysis will not completely eliminate the uncertainties involved jff can produce a more sophisticated understanding of contingent results for which there is scientific consensus and distinguish it from claims that do not have a defensible scientific basis due to the uncertainty inherent in real world situations schenk 2017 suggests that the best we can hope to achieve through joint fact finding is to identify facts for now and facts for use facts for now are contextually appropriate specific and more or less ephemeral schenk 2017 and recognize the changing nature of many complex situations along with the need for adaptive management informed by continuous monitoring data collection and analysis facts for use include information or forecasts that stakeholders can use to make decisions these facts may be imperfect but are bracketed appropriately to take into account different types of uncertainty and the impact of subjective judgments to allow action to proceed the end goal of joint fact finding is to arrive at an agreed upon understanding that is both scientifically sound and publicly credible so that stakeholders and decision makers can then move on to collaborative problem solving karl et al 2007 jff when organized properly makes it explicit about what is knowable objectively and what needs to be discussed subjectively susskind and cruikshank 1987 ehrmann and stinson 1999 schenk et al 2016 4 2 1 essential steps of joint fact finding specifically jff involves six essential steps described in fig 3 step 1 assess the need for jff the decision making agency or group of agencies decides whether or not there is a scientific or technical issue that requires more clarity and if so takes on the role of the convener the convener helps identify stakeholders calls meetings and provides financial and sometimes technical support throughout the process this should be managed by a professional facilitator to establish a neutral and inclusive process the facilitator should conduct a pre jff assessment that identifies the stakeholders information and knowledge gaps and stakeholders incentives to participate in jff step 2 convene the stakeholders if the convener and facilitator decide that jff would be valuable they convene a representative group of stakeholders based on the results of step 1 the facilitator helps this group draft ground rules roles responsibilities and a timeline the group generates general scientific or technical questions that they would like to address through jff with the help of agreed upon technical advisors independent of the convening agency staff step 3 define the scope of the study the group defines the scope and objectives of the jff effort and translates general questions into a small number of precise research questions by the end of this stage the group should agree on i key research questions ii the analytic methods to be used to answer those questions iii the type of expert advice required for analysis and interpretation and iv a timeframe for the work to be completed susskind et al 2017 step 4 conduct the jff study the representative group defines the sources of data e g indigenous quantitative qualitative etc that should be included before their expert advisors conduct the study step 5 evaluate the results of the study afterwards the experts communicate their findings to the representative group identify any remaining sources of uncertainty and discuss their confidence in their findings these results are combined into a single technical report assuming the stakeholders understand and accept the results of the studies they can use the findings to continue a joint problem solving effort aimed at generating policy recommendations for the convening agency step 6 communicate the results of the jff process in the final step stakeholder representatives communicate the findings of their jff effort to the broader public and to policymakers if appropriate this becomes the first step in a longer consensus building or problem solving process in which the full group of stakeholders has an opportunity to collaborate with the jff task force in developing a final set of policy recommendations an example of joint fact finding facilitated by concur inc involving the guadalupe river flood control project collaborative illustrates how a large number of stakeholders avoided adversarial legal proceedings and instead jointly agreed upon project objectives and performance criteria karl et al 2007 the focus was how to resolve disagreements over flood mitigation for the lower guadalupe river in downtown san jose in california mutually agreed upon experts evaluated alternatives based on chosen criteria objectives metrics and indicators and worked with stakeholders to explain their findings the multi year process informed stakeholders balanced technical and financial disparities and created an acceptable management strategy at the collaborative s final meeting one of the environmental group s attorneys withdraw their citizen suit the agreement on project redesign produced efficiency gains that cut 100 million from the original mitigation project cost relationships were improved and the first agreement was followed by an ongoing collaborative adaptive management effort 4 3 creating value through the generation of mutually advantageous options historically most water negotiations assume a fixed quantity of water based on an average of past water levels over a chosen time period for example the 1959 nile agreement on the full utilization of the nile waters assumed that a fixed amount of water 84 bcm would be allocated between egypt 55 5 bcm and sudan 18 5 bcm when the parties assume a fixed amount of water in a particular location it is easy to further assume that negotiations must take a zero sum format this outlook often leads to hard bargaining or a test of will and drives out the possibility of cooperation or the invention of mutually advantageous outcomes mga style negotiation involves all sides looking for opportunities to reach an agreement that is mutually beneficial susskind 2014 it requires parties to think of options in which each gets their most important interests met in exchange for helping the other side s to achieve their top priorities for example if one side is mostly concerned about having more water in the dry season they don t necessarily need an overall increase in their share of the total supply for the whole year they just need a guarantee that they will have more water during drier months the other side might have more storage capacity and could promise to release a substantial amount of water during the dry season while retaining its annual overall share of the total supply they might jointly invest in new infrastructure to make such an agreement work this kind of integrative solution to meeting the interests of the two sides requires trust and cooperation the goal of a mga is to reach a negotiated agreement that is more beneficial to both sides than what each might expect if there were no agreement or each pursued their own interests unilaterally 4 3 1 value creation in boundary crossing water disputes in the case of boundary crossing water negotiation value creation may occur in several ways first by redefining the issues on the agenda i e scale scope number etc second by creating more water and third by recognizing the full bundle of benefits sometimes on a range of related issues that could be gained by new levels of cooperation value creation may be achieved by increasing the scale or scope of water management usually a watershed is taken as the unit of planning to achieve optimal water use increasing the scale of water planning however beyond the boundaries of a watershed can allow parties to incorporate additional issues into their negotiation such as water for agricultural production energy production and domestic use in neighboring watersheds adding issues to the agenda makes it easier to find packages that are mutually advantageous for example a country might invest in a hydroelectric dam in a neighboring country in exchange for discounted electricity considering multiple issues simultaneously is often the key to value creation in boundary crossing water negotiations grzybowski et al 2010 however when governance boundaries and hydrologic boundaries don t overlap implementation problems arise this means that negotiated agreements if the scope of the discussion broadens may require creation of new institutional arrangements the water diplomacy framework suggests that value creation requires thinking about and managing water as a flexible not a fixed resource susskind and islam 2012 islam and susskind 2013 there are several ways of creating more water by treating water as a flexible resource for example through reclassification of water for different purposes investment in new technology or more efficient water usage distinguishing between blue and green water or through recognition of virtual water allan 2011 one such example of creating flexibility through mga is found in israel and jordan s 1994 peace treaty jordan had no water storage capability on its side israel agreed to store water for jordan in lake tiberius during the wet season and release it to jordan during the dry season israel also agreed to help construct new transport infrastructure to reduce water loss en route to jordan israel got the peace treaty it wanted while jordan found a way to meet its water needs during the dry season for more details please see susskind and islam 2012 clearly more expanded discussion with case studies would help us make a stronger argument about the applicability of wdf within the context of complexity science and negotiation theory however given the limited space requirement of this journal we refer to the range of case studies we have compiled on how to resolve water conflicts using complexity science negotiation theory and water diplomacy framework as described in detail in several papers and books e g ibrahim and islam 2017 pohl and swain 2017 islam and madani 2017 choudnury and islam 2018 aquapedia http aquapedia waterdiplomacy org we also refer to six blog pieces that describe several case studies discussed in this paper http blog waterdiplomacy org 2015 08 water diplomacy issues of complexity science and negotiation theory 5 concluding remarks many of our current and emerging water governance and managementissues are complex case examples like those discussed above from bolivia california egypt israel and jordan illustrate how complexity manifests in water management these real world examples exhibit attributes of complex systems through their interconnected nature feedback and emergent patterns for many of our water problems interconnectedness is accelerating often they seem to entail impenetrable webs of cause and effect in such situations instead of looking at systems in isolation i e rather than looking at elements focus on interactions and interdependencies among elements insights from complexity science prompts us to step back and look at how elements interact to create emergent patterns unexpected patterns will continue to emerge and we will not know where the next one will come from and how it will affect water access allocation and use this of course means that all water agreements need to be adaptable to a changing and unpredictable future embracing these concepts from complexity science will require rethinking and reframing of some basic assumptions about water management including moving away from politically convenient boundary setting that ignores system interconnections adopting contingent and easily modifiable water sharing agreements that emphasize adjustments to uncertainty and feedback and building stronger relationships among involved parties so that joint problem solving in the face of emergent patterns is easier our challenge is to prepare and design natural societal and engineered systems that are able to recover quickly from unexpected events and adapt to the constantly changing nature of complex systems insights from complexity science may be helpful in this regard complex water systems are neither random nor perfectly predictable it is the recognition of the balance between degree of flexibility too much flexibility among interacting elements make the system random and constraints a highly constrained set of interacting elements may make the system simple and predictable but vulnerable to unexpected event may help in addressing complex water issues to analyze complex systems can be decomposed in many different ways e g choice of number of elements and their nature of interactions in addressing water use among alfalfa and almonds and their relationships with the economy and other use of water in california and the insights gained by different decomposition will be different all decompositions however are not equally valid or relevant in fact decomposition is a choice and it has consequences more importantly this choice is contingent for a given problem context this is where negotiated choice of decomposition becomes an essential component of understanding governing and managing complex water systems we will not have complete knowledge of complex systems yet we need to act with limited and uncertain information by choosing a framework such choices however need not be arbitrary admittedly knowledge for complex systems will always remain limited and contingent understanding these limits though can lead to decisions that are neither relativistic nor vague but negotiated through a carefully crafted framework based on a set of agreed upon guiding principles a recurrent factor in traditional problem solving for water management is the separation of what is from what ought to be dimensions of the problem the wdf emphasizes that when dealing with complex problems these dimensions cannot be separated the wdf acknowledges both the limits to knowledge objectivity of observations and subjectivity of interpretation as well as the contingent nature of all action as an effect of complexity furthermore the wdf asserts that parties need to seek consensus on guiding principles and mutual value creation when negotiating a resolution of their differences we hope the combination of ideas and tools illustrated here with the included references will encourage and motivate water professionals to seek to blend insights from complexity science with tools from negotiation theory to address the most pressing complex water problems of our time
