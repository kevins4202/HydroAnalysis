reaction 1 blatchley and cheng 2010 they observed that the formation of monochlorourea was accelerated by decreasing ph because the reaction mainly proceeds via cl2 a stronger electrophile than hocl which dominates at acidic ph monitoring changes in the concentration of monochlorourea at ph 3 and 7 5 in the reaction of excess urea relative to chlorine they observed that monochlorourea was stable at ph 3 in the absence of chlorine but degraded at ph 7 5 in the presence of residual chlorine however they did not comment on the effect of ph on the degradation of monochlorourea they noted the presence or absence of chlorine rather than the ph effect in this study we focused on the processes occurring after the formation of monochlorourea i e reactions 2 5 particularly on their ph dependence and we newly found that the degradation of monochlorourea was favored under neutral or alkaline ph conditions based on this observation the ph swing i e a shift of ph from acidic to neutral or alkaline values during the reaction was proposed as a method to enhance the degradation of urea by chlorination the ph swing chlorination was able to completely degrade trace amounts of urea at

m hclo4 and 1 m naoh an aliquot of sodium hypochlorite naocl solution was added to the reaction solution after ph adjustment to initiate the reaction for the experiments using the ph swing method the

method decrease in the absorbance was measured at 515 nm using a uv vis spectrophotometer lambda 465 perkinelmer mulvenna and savidge 1992 with a 5 cm quartz cuvette cell because the diacetyl monoxime method cannot distinguish urea from chloroureas the measured values indicate total concentrations of urea and chloroureas i e chloro ureas the concentration of monochlorourea was determined by measuring uv absorbance at 245 nm with a 5 cm quartz cuvette cell blatchley and cheng 2010 the concentration of free chlorine was determined using the colorimetric dpd method for this method 125 μ l of phosphate buffered solution 0 5 m ph 6 and 125 μ l of dpd solution 1 w v dissolved in 0 1 n h2so4 solution were added into 2 5 ml of sample and the absorbance was measured at 515 nm the

different conditions ph 3 ph 7 and ph swing from 3 to 7 fig 1a chloro ureas were degraded by 21 and 17 in 150 min at ph 3 and 7 respectively in contrast 92 of the chloro ureas were degraded under ph swing conditions wherein the reaction proceeded at ph 3 for 30 min and then at ph 7 for 120 min the chlorine decay was monitored under the same conditions fig 1b during the chlorination of urea 64 of chlorine was consumed at ph 3 in 150 min note that chlorine was rapidly consumed in 10 min followed by slow decay at ph 7 24 chlorine was gradually consumed during the entire reaction time under the ph swing condition ph 3 7 chlorine was completely consumed within 150 min at ph 3 the rapid initial consumption of chlorine without significant degradation of chloro ureas results from the conversion of urea into monochlorourea the subsequent reaction of monochlorourea with chlorine proceeds slowly at ph 7 both chloro ureas degradation and chlorine decay were not significant because the first step of urea chlorination formation of monochlorourea is favored at acidic ph blatchley and cheng 2010 upon ph swing ph 3 7 chloro ureas were degraded significantly along with substantial chlorine decay which indicates that monochlorourea formed at ph 3 reacts with chlorine at ph 7 causing complete urea degradation the stability of monochlorourea in the absence of chlorine was also examined fig s1 monochlorourea was formed by the reaction of equimolar concentrations of urea and chlorine urea 0 chlorine 0 100 μ m at ph 3 for 24 h fig s1a which was verified by the uv absorbance at 245 nm blatchley and cheng 2010 and no residual chlorine remained refer to the inset of fig 1a thereafter the solution ph was raised to neutral and alkaline values 7 8 9 and 10 and variations in the monochlorourea concentration were monitored for 120 min fig s1b monochlorourea concentration did not change at all ph values indicating that monochlorourea was stable under neutral and alkaline ph conditions in the absence of chlorine chloro ureas were identified using lc ms fig s2 after reaction under three different conditions i e ph 3 ph 7 and ph swing from 3 to 7 and the results were consistent with those of chloro ureas degradation and chlorine decay fig 1 at ph 3 the peaks of urea monochlorourea and dichlorourea were observed with the highest intensity for monochlorourea fig s2a which implies that monochlorourea was dominantly formed and the subsequent conversion into dichlorourea proceeded slowly at ph 7 only the urea peak was identified fig s2b indicating that urea chlorination rarely occurred under ph swing conditions ph 3 7 the peaks of urea and monochlorourea showed reduced intensities compared to those at ph 3 fig s2c indicating that chloro ureas were significantly degraded the reaction time for the first stage at ph 3 during the ph swing chlorination was 30 min however it was necessary to investigate whether this reaction time was appropriate the decrease in urea concentration by the first chlorination reaction i e conversion into monochlorourea was modeled using known rate constants for the reactions of urea with cl2 and hocl text s1 the modeling showed that urea was completely converted into monochlorourea in 10 min at ph 3 fig s3a and s3b indicating that the 30 min reaction time was sufficient in addition ph swing chlorination was also tested with a 10 min reaction at ph 3 fig s4 as a result 88 of chloro ureas were degraded indicating that the first stage reaction time can be shortened depending on the conditions the ph swing chlorination was tested at a lower initial concentration of urea 3 3 μm fig s5 to achieve sufficient urea degradation the reaction time of the first stage at ph 3 was increased from 30 to 120 min and the chlorine urea molar ratio was increased from 4 to 10 under ph swing conditions ph 3 7 87 of chloro ureas were degraded whereas the degradation of chloro ureas was negligible at ph 3 and 7 4 and 11 respectively fig s5a similarly 90 of chlorine was consumed during ph swing chlorination while less chlorine was consumed at ph 3 and 7 47 and 41 respectively fig s5b these results imply that ph swing chlorination can be successfully applied to degrade trace levels of urea furthermore the ph swing chlorination of urea was examined in filtered natural water and tap water fig s6 also refer to table s1 for the water quality parameters at high concentrations of urea and chlorine no significant effect of the water matrix was observed fig s6a but at low concentrations of urea and chlorine chloro urea degradation was slightly inhibited due to scavenging of chlorine by natural organic matter fig s6b 3 2 effect of chlorine dose the effect of chlorine dose on the degradation of urea by chlorination was examined fig 2 during the ph swing chlorination the degradation of chloro ureas accelerated with increasing chlorine dose fig 2a in contrast the chlorine consumption rate decreased as the chlorine dose increased fig 2b the degradation of chloro ureas by 100 μ m chlorine was minor 9 because more than 90 of the chlorine was consumed in the first stage to form monochlorourea notably the ratio of consumed chlorine to degraded chloro ureas δ chlorine δ chloro ureas exhibited a minimum value of 4 1 refer to the inset of fig 2b indicating that approximately four equivalents of chlorine are sufficient to completely degrade urea this stoichiometry contradicts the proposed mechanism of urea chlorination reactions 2 5 wherein c n bond cleavage in urea occurs via the reaction of chlorine with tetrachlorourea formed by consecutive cl substitution reactions in this case five equivalents of chlorine are required to degrade one unit urea a possible explanation is that tetrachlorourea undergoes hydrolysis without being attacked by chlorine reaction 7 7 co nc l 2 2 h 2 o c o 2 2 nhc l 2 the effect of chlorine dose on urea chlorination was investigated at ph 3 and 7 refer to figs s7 and s8 respectively the degradation of chloro ureas was slightly enhanced by increasing the chlorine dose fig s7a indicating that further chlorination of monochlorourea occurred partially at higher chlorine doses at ph 7 the enhancement in urea degradation with increasing chlorine dose was more pronounced fig s8a which is attributed to greater production of monochlorourea at higher concentrations of chlorine the effect of chlorine dose was tested for a lower initial concentration of urea 3 3 μm under three different conditions i e ph 3 ph 7 and ph swing from 3 to 7 figs s9 s11 the urea degradation rate under ph swing chlorination increased with increasing chlorine dose fig s9 whereas such an enhancement was not observed at ph 3 and 7 figs s10 and s11 due to the slow reaction kinetics at low urea concentrations efficiency of urea degradation by ph swing chlorination under different conditions of urea and chlorine concentrations and the first stage reaction time were summarized table s2 3 3 effect of ph ph swing chlorination was performed by varying the ph for the second stage reaction ph 3 10 fig 3a also refer to fig s12 for additional data the degradation of chloro ureas was accelerated by increasing the ph during the second stage the observed first order rate constant k for the degradation of chloro ureas in the second stage was calculated for each ph condition fig s13 where chloro ureas 0 was set as the concentration at 30 min the time to initiate the second stage under the ph swing the data points for less than 80 degradation were used in the first order fitting ahmad et al 2013 the obtained rate constants k values are depicted as a function of ph fig 3b an increase in the k value was observed in two regions a minor increase in the range of ph 3 7 and a drastic increase at ph 8 the ph dependence of the k value can be explained by the speciation change of the reactants i e chlorine and chloroureas the ph dependent speciation of chlorine is well known reactions 8 and 9 morris 1966 wang and margerum 1994 cherney et al 2006 the dominant chlorine species shifts from cl2 hocl ocl with increasing ph 8 hocl clo h pk a 7 54 25 c 9 cl2 h2o hocl h cl k 1 04 10 3 m2 25 c i 0 5 m because the reactivity electrophilicity of chlorine species decreases in the order of cl2 hocl ocl blatchley and cheng 2010 deborde and von gunten 2008 broadwater et al 2018 cai et al 2013 lau et al 2019 thomm and wayman 1969 wang et al 2022 rose et al 2020 chlorine speciation cannot explain the increasing k value with ph therefore the speciation of chloroureas is a key factor affecting the ph dependent urea degradation rate the deprotonation of chloroureas can promote chlorination because the chlorination of nitrogen compounds proceeds via an electrophilic reaction of the cl moiety of free chlorine with the nitrogen atom in the compound johnson and margerum 1991 abia et al 1998 deprotonated nitrogen has a higher electron density making it more vulnerable to attack by electrophiles the pka values of mono di and trichloroureas were calculated to be 9 7 1 1 monochlorourea 5 1 1 4 dichlorourea and 0 5 1 8 trichlorourea using the acd percepta 2021 2 0 software advanced chemistry development inc trichlorourea existed in the deprotonated form over the entire ph range investigated in this study monochlorourea and dichlorourea began to go through significant deprotonation approximately at ph 8 and 3 respectively fig s14 notably these values coincide with the two regions where the k value increased i e ph 3 7 and ph 8 respectively in fig 3b indicating that the deprotonation of dichlorourea and monochlorourea is responsible for the increase in the k value ph dependent reaction pathways of urea chlorination were proposed scheme 1 and they can explain the increasing trend of k value with ph fig 3b in the range of ph 3 7 the slightly increased k value due to the deprotonation of dichlorourea indicates that the chlorination of the protonated dichlorourea pathway ii is slower than that of protonated monochlorourea pathway i however it is apparent that both reactions pathways i and ii are slower than those of their deprotonated counterparts pathways iii and iv in the range of ph 7 8 the k value was relatively stagnant because the speciation of both monochlorourea and dichlorourea did not significantly change fig s13 most of the monochlorourea and dichlorourea were present in protonated and deprotonated forms respectively at ph 8 the overall reaction was accelerated by deprotonation of monochlorourea 3 4 nitrogenous products of urea chlorination previous studies suggested that chloramines ncl3 nhcl2 nh2cl nh4 and no3 are produced during the chlorination of urea de laat et al 2011 blatchley and cheng 2010 li and blatchley 2007 cho and hoffmann 2014 the hydrolysis of tetrachlorourea and further chlorination produce chloramines blatchley and cheng 2010 nh4 and no3 are produced by the redox reactions of chloramines jafvert and valentine 1992 pham et al 2021 pressley et al 1972 in this study the concentrations of nh4 plus chloramines no3 and tn were measured under six different conditions i e ph 3 ph 7 and ph swing from 3 to 7 and closed and open systems for each ph condition fig 4 in the closed system at ph 3 fig 4a the tn concentration was almost constant and approximately 40 μm of nh4 and chloramines were produced in contrast in the open system at ph 3 fig 4b 23 of the tn 46 μm was removed which agrees with the 20 degradation of chloro urea as shown in fig 1a and nh4 and chloramines were hardly detected these observations indicate that most of the final nitrogen products formed by urea degradation at ph 3 are chloramines particularly trichloramine which were volatilized in the open system li and blatchley 2007 holzwarth et al 1984 meanwhile no3 formation was insignificant for both closed and open systems fig 4a and b indicating that further oxidation of chloramines hardly occurs at ph 3 at ph 7 closed and open systems exhibited similar trends for the removal of tn and formation of nitrogen products fig 4c and d these results indicate that nitrogen loss via volatile chloramines is negligible which is consistent with the low concentration of nh4 and chloramines the tn concentration decreased by 20 24 for the two systems possibly due to the formation of gaseous nitrogen products compared to the results at ph 3 a greater amount of no3 8 11 μm was produced at ph 7 which is due to the accelerated oxidation of chloramines with increasing ph pressley et al 1972 under the ph swing condition ph 3 7 the tn concentration decreased by 83 and 88 in the closed and open systems respectively fig 4e and f the tn removal in the open system reasonably agreed with the 92 degradation of chloro ureas fig 1a in the closed system approximately 40 μm of nitrogen products chloramines nh4 and no3 were produced exhibiting a gradual oxidative conversion of chloramines into no3 fig 4e however in the open system the production of nitrogen products were negligible because of the volatilization of chloramines fig 4f most of the nitrogen loss during ph swing chlorination is believed to result from the production of gaseous nitrogen compounds according to previous studies pham et al 2021 kumar et al 1987 hand and margerum 1983 n2 and n2o gases can be produced by the self decomposition and hydrolysis of chloramines reactions 10 13 10 2 nc l 3 6 o h n 2 3 oc l 3 c l 3 h 2 o 11 nhcl 2 ncl 3 3 oh n 2 2 hocl 3 cl h 2 o 12 nhc l 2 h 2 o hno 2 h 2 c l 13 2 hno n 2 o h 2 o 4 conclusions in this study ph swing chlorination shifting the ph from acidic to neutral or alkaline values during chlorination was suggested as a novel approach to accelerate the degradation of urea this study also contributed to resolving the uncertainties regarding the mechanism underlying urea chlorination by elucidating the role of chlorourea deprotonation ph swing chlorination was found to be effective in degrading urea at a low concentration 3 3 μm which has rarely been reported in previous studies on urea treatment considering that urea is oxidation resistant and its oxidative degradation usually requires high concentrations of reactants oxidants or urea high energy input or long reaction time ph swing chlorination offers a more feasible option for treating urea in the field ph swing chlorination can be applied to remove urea from source water reclaimed wastewater or surface water in upw production systems however for practical applications alternating ph control and long overall reaction times can be obstacles which warrants further study for process optimization moreover during the application of ph swing chlorination special attention should be paid to harmful by products particularly trichloramine which may pose potential risks to human health declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

q integral 5 millipore the natural water samples were collected from the han river and filtered using nylon membrane filters 0 45 μm the water samples were stored at 4 c until use 2 2 experimental procedure urea chlorination experiments were conducted at room temperature 22 1 c using 100 ml of urea solution open to the atmosphere the ph of the solution was adjusted to the desired value using 1 m hclo4 and 1 m naoh an aliquot of sodium hypochlorite naocl solution was added to the reaction solution after ph adjustment to initiate the reaction for the experiments using the ph swing method the ph of the solution was adjusted to 3 for the first stage reaction and then increased to the desired value using 0 5 m phosphate buffer and 1 m naoh the reaction solution was stirred continuously at 200 rpm samples 1 ml and 0 25 ml for urea and chlorine analysis respectively were withdrawn at predetermined time intervals and immediately subjected to analysis after dilution with di water all experiments were conducted at least in duplicate and the average values with standard deviations are presented experiments to measure nitrogenous products nh4 no3 and chloramines were performed using 40 ml urea solutions under open and closed capped with no headspace conditions after ph adjustment the reaction was initiated by adding naocl to quench residual chlorine 20 μ l of sodium thiosulfate solution 20 mm was immediately added to the samples the experiments to measure total nitrogen tn were performed using 400 ml of urea solution samples 30 ml were withdrawn at predetermined time intervals and 0 12 ml of sodium thiosulfate solution 100 mm was immediately added to quench residual chlorine 2 3 analytical methods the urea concentration was determined by the diacetyl monoxime method decrease in the absorbance was measured at 515 nm using a uv vis spectrophotometer lambda 465 perkinelmer mulvenna and savidge 1992 with a 5 cm quartz cuvette cell because the diacetyl monoxime method cannot distinguish urea from chloroureas the measured values indicate total concentrations of urea and chloroureas i e chloro ureas the concentration of monochlorourea was determined by measuring uv absorbance at 245 nm with a 5 cm quartz cuvette cell blatchley and cheng 2010 the concentration of free chlorine was determined using the colorimetric dpd method for this method 125 μ l of phosphate buffered solution 0 5 m ph 6 and 125 μ l of dpd solution 1 w v dissolved in 0 1 n h2so4 solution were added into 2 5 ml of sample and the absorbance was measured at 515 nm the

different conditions ph 3 ph 7 and ph swing from 3 to 7 fig 1a chloro ureas were degraded by 21 and 17 in 150 min at ph 3 and 7 respectively in contrast 92 of the chloro ureas were degraded under ph swing conditions wherein the reaction proceeded at ph 3 for 30 min and then at ph 7 for 120 min the chlorine decay was monitored under the same conditions fig 1b during the chlorination of urea 64 of chlorine was consumed at ph 3 in 150 min note that chlorine was rapidly consumed in 10 min followed by slow decay at ph 7 24 chlorine was gradually consumed during the entire reaction time under the ph swing condition ph 3 7 chlorine was completely consumed within 150 min at ph 3 the rapid initial consumption of chlorine without significant degradation of chloro ureas results from the conversion of urea into monochlorourea the subsequent reaction of monochlorourea with chlorine proceeds slowly at ph 7 both chloro ureas degradation and chlorine decay were not significant because the first step of urea chlorination formation of monochlorourea is favored at acidic ph blatchley and cheng 2010 upon ph swing ph 3 7 chloro ureas were degraded significantly along with substantial chlorine decay which indicates that monochlorourea formed at ph 3 reacts with chlorine at ph 7 causing complete urea degradation the stability of monochlorourea in the absence of chlorine was also examined fig s1 monochlorourea was formed by the reaction of equimolar concentrations of urea and chlorine urea 0 chlorine 0 100 μ m at ph 3 for 24 h fig s1a which was verified by the uv absorbance at 245 nm blatchley and cheng 2010 and no residual chlorine remained refer to the inset of fig 1a thereafter the solution ph was raised to neutral and alkaline values 7 8 9 and 10 and variations in the monochlorourea concentration were monitored for 120 min fig s1b monochlorourea concentration did not change at all ph values indicating that monochlorourea was stable under neutral and alkaline ph conditions in the absence of chlorine chloro ureas were identified using lc ms fig s2 after reaction under three different conditions i e ph 3 ph 7 and ph swing from 3 to 7 and the results were consistent with those of chloro ureas degradation and chlorine decay fig 1 at ph 3 the peaks of urea monochlorourea and dichlorourea were observed with the highest intensity for monochlorourea fig s2a which implies that monochlorourea was dominantly formed and the subsequent conversion into dichlorourea proceeded slowly at ph 7 only the urea peak was identified fig s2b indicating that urea chlorination rarely occurred under ph swing conditions ph 3 7 the peaks of urea and monochlorourea showed reduced intensities compared to those at ph 3 fig s2c indicating that chloro ureas were significantly degraded the reaction time for the first stage at ph 3 during the ph swing chlorination was 30 min however it was necessary to investigate whether this reaction time was appropriate the decrease in urea concentration by the first chlorination reaction i e conversion into monochlorourea was modeled using known rate constants for the reactions of urea with cl2 and hocl text s1 the modeling showed that urea was completely converted into monochlorourea in 10 min at ph 3 fig s3a and s3b indicating that the 30 min reaction time was sufficient in addition ph swing chlorination was also tested with a 10 min reaction at ph 3 fig s4 as a result 88 of chloro ureas were degraded indicating that the first stage reaction time can be shortened depending on the conditions the ph swing chlorination was tested at a lower initial concentration of urea 3 3 μm fig s5 to achieve sufficient urea degradation the reaction time of the first stage at ph 3 was increased from 30 to 120 min and the chlorine urea molar ratio was increased from 4 to 10 under ph swing conditions ph 3 7 87 of chloro ureas were degraded whereas the degradation of chloro ureas was negligible at ph 3 and 7 4 and 11 respectively fig s5a similarly 90 of chlorine was consumed during ph swing chlorination while less chlorine was consumed at ph 3 and 7 47 and 41 respectively fig s5b these results imply that ph swing chlorination can be successfully applied to degrade trace levels of urea furthermore the ph swing chlorination of urea was examined in filtered natural water and tap water fig s6 also refer to table s1 for the water quality parameters at high concentrations of urea and chlorine no significant effect of the water matrix was observed fig s6a but at low concentrations of urea and chlorine chloro urea degradation was slightly inhibited due to scavenging of chlorine by natural organic matter fig s6b 3 2 effect of chlorine dose the effect of chlorine dose on the degradation of urea by chlorination was examined fig 2 during the ph swing chlorination the degradation of chloro ureas accelerated with increasing chlorine dose fig 2a in contrast the chlorine consumption rate decreased as the chlorine dose increased fig 2b the degradation of chloro ureas by 100 μ m chlorine was minor 9 because more than 90 of the chlorine was consumed in the first stage to form monochlorourea notably the ratio of consumed chlorine to degraded chloro ureas δ chlorine δ chloro ureas exhibited a minimum value of 4 1 refer to the inset of fig 2b indicating that approximately four equivalents of chlorine are sufficient to completely degrade urea this stoichiometry contradicts the proposed mechanism of urea chlorination reactions 2 5 wherein c n bond cleavage in urea occurs via the reaction of chlorine with tetrachlorourea formed by consecutive cl substitution reactions in this case five equivalents of chlorine are required to degrade one unit urea a possible explanation is that tetrachlorourea undergoes hydrolysis without being attacked by chlorine reaction 7 7 co nc l 2 2 h 2 o c o 2 2 nhc l 2 the effect of chlorine dose on urea chlorination was investigated at ph 3 and 7 refer to figs s7 and s8 respectively the degradation of chloro ureas was slightly enhanced by increasing the chlorine dose fig s7a indicating that further chlorination of monochlorourea occurred partially at higher chlorine doses at ph 7 the enhancement in urea degradation with increasing chlorine dose was more pronounced fig s8a which is attributed to greater production of monochlorourea at higher concentrations of chlorine the effect of chlorine dose was tested for a lower initial concentration of urea 3 3 μm under three different conditions i e ph 3 ph 7 and ph swing from 3 to 7 figs s9 s11 the urea degradation rate under ph swing chlorination increased with increasing chlorine dose fig s9 whereas such an enhancement was not observed at ph 3 and 7 figs s10 and s11 due to the slow reaction kinetics at low urea concentrations efficiency of urea degradation by ph swing chlorination under different conditions of urea and chlorine concentrations and the first stage reaction time were summarized table s2 3 3 effect of ph ph swing chlorination was performed by varying the ph for the second stage reaction ph 3 10 fig 3a also refer to fig s12 for additional data the degradation of chloro ureas was accelerated by increasing the ph during the second stage the observed first order rate constant k for the degradation of chloro ureas in the second stage was calculated for each ph condition fig s13 where chloro ureas 0 was set as the concentration at 30 min the time to initiate the second stage under the ph swing the data points for less than 80 degradation were used in the first order fitting ahmad et al 2013 the obtained rate constants k values are depicted as a function of ph fig 3b an increase in the k value was observed in two regions a minor increase in the range of ph 3 7 and a drastic increase at ph 8 the ph dependence of the k value can be explained by the speciation change of the reactants i e chlorine and chloroureas the ph dependent speciation of chlorine is well known reactions 8 and 9 morris 1966 wang and margerum 1994 cherney et al 2006 the dominant chlorine species shifts from cl2 hocl ocl with increasing ph 8 hocl clo h pk a 7 54 25 c 9 cl2 h2o hocl h cl k 1 04 10 3 m2 25 c i 0 5 m because the reactivity electrophilicity of chlorine species decreases in the order of cl2 hocl ocl blatchley and cheng 2010 deborde and von gunten 2008 broadwater et al 2018 cai et al 2013 lau et al 2019 thomm and wayman 1969 wang et al 2022 rose et al 2020 chlorine speciation cannot explain the increasing k value with ph therefore the speciation of chloroureas is a key factor affecting the ph dependent urea degradation rate the deprotonation of chloroureas can promote chlorination because the chlorination of nitrogen compounds proceeds via an electrophilic reaction of the cl moiety of free chlorine with the nitrogen atom in the compound johnson and margerum 1991 abia et al 1998 deprotonated nitrogen has a higher electron density making it more vulnerable to attack by electrophiles the pka values of mono di and trichloroureas were calculated to be 9 7 1 1 monochlorourea 5 1 1 4 dichlorourea and 0 5 1 8 trichlorourea using the acd percepta 2021 2 0 software advanced chemistry development inc trichlorourea existed in the deprotonated form over the entire ph range investigated in this study monochlorourea and dichlorourea began to go through significant deprotonation approximately at ph 8 and 3 respectively fig s14 notably these values coincide with the two regions where the k value increased i e ph 3 7 and ph 8 respectively in fig 3b indicating that the deprotonation of dichlorourea and monochlorourea is responsible for the increase in the k value ph dependent reaction pathways of urea chlorination were proposed scheme 1 and they can explain the increasing trend of k value with ph fig 3b in the range of ph 3 7 the slightly increased k value due to the deprotonation of dichlorourea indicates that the chlorination of the protonated dichlorourea pathway ii is slower than that of protonated monochlorourea pathway i however it is apparent that both reactions pathways i and ii are slower than those of their deprotonated counterparts pathways iii and iv in the range of ph 7 8 the k value was relatively stagnant because the speciation of both monochlorourea and dichlorourea did not significantly change fig s13 most of the monochlorourea and dichlorourea were present in protonated and deprotonated forms respectively at ph 8 the overall reaction was accelerated by deprotonation of monochlorourea 3 4 nitrogenous products of urea chlorination previous studies suggested that chloramines ncl3 nhcl2 nh2cl nh4 and no3 are produced during the chlorination of urea de laat et al 2011 blatchley and cheng 2010 li and blatchley 2007 cho and hoffmann 2014 the hydrolysis of tetrachlorourea and further chlorination produce chloramines blatchley and cheng 2010 nh4 and no3 are produced by the redox reactions of chloramines jafvert and valentine 1992 pham et al 2021 pressley et al 1972 in this study the concentrations of nh4 plus chloramines no3 and tn were measured under six different conditions i e ph 3 ph 7 and ph swing from 3 to 7 and closed and open systems for each ph condition fig 4 in the closed system at ph 3 fig 4a the tn concentration was almost constant and approximately 40 μm of nh4 and chloramines were produced in contrast in the open system at ph 3 fig 4b 23 of the tn 46 μm was removed which agrees with the 20 degradation of chloro urea as shown in fig 1a and nh4 and chloramines were hardly detected these observations indicate that most of the final nitrogen products formed by urea degradation at ph 3 are chloramines particularly trichloramine which were volatilized in the open system li and blatchley 2007 holzwarth et al 1984 meanwhile no3 formation was insignificant for both closed and open systems fig 4a and b indicating that further oxidation of chloramines hardly occurs at ph 3 at ph 7 closed and open systems exhibited similar trends for the removal of tn and formation of nitrogen products fig 4c and d these results indicate that nitrogen loss via volatile chloramines is negligible which is consistent with the low concentration of nh4 and chloramines the tn concentration decreased by 20 24 for the two systems possibly due to the formation of gaseous nitrogen products compared to the results at ph 3 a greater amount of no3 8 11 μm was produced at ph 7 which is due to the accelerated oxidation of chloramines with increasing ph pressley et al 1972 under the ph swing condition ph 3 7 the tn concentration decreased by 83 and 88 in the closed and open systems respectively fig 4e and f the tn removal in the open system reasonably agreed with the 92 degradation of chloro ureas fig 1a in the closed system approximately 40 μm of nitrogen products chloramines nh4 and no3 were produced exhibiting a gradual oxidative conversion of chloramines into no3 fig 4e however in the open system the production of nitrogen products were negligible because of the volatilization of chloramines fig 4f most of the nitrogen loss during ph swing chlorination is believed to result from the production of gaseous nitrogen compounds according to previous studies pham et al 2021 kumar et al 1987 hand and margerum 1983 n2 and n2o gases can be produced by the self decomposition and hydrolysis of chloramines reactions 10 13 10 2 nc l 3 6 o h n 2 3 oc l 3 c l 3 h 2 o 11 nhcl 2 ncl 3 3 oh n 2 2 hocl 3 cl h 2 o 12 nhc l 2 h 2 o hno 2 h 2 c l 13 2 hno n 2 o h 2 o 4 conclusions in this study ph swing chlorination shifting the ph from acidic to neutral or alkaline values during chlorination was suggested as a novel approach to accelerate the degradation of urea this study also contributed to resolving the uncertainties regarding the mechanism underlying urea chlorination by elucidating the role of chlorourea deprotonation ph swing chlorination was found to be effective in degrading urea at a low concentration 3 3 μm which has rarely been reported in previous studies on urea treatment considering that urea is oxidation resistant and its oxidative degradation usually requires high concentrations of reactants oxidants or urea high energy input or long reaction time ph swing chlorination offers a more feasible option for treating urea in the field ph swing chlorination can be applied to remove urea from source water reclaimed wastewater or surface water in upw production systems however for practical applications alternating ph control and long overall reaction times can be obstacles which warrants further study for process optimization moreover during the application of ph swing chlorination special attention should be paid to harmful by products particularly trichloramine which may pose potential risks to human health declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

14621,culture independent data can be utilized to identify heterotrophic plate count hpc exceedances in drinking water although hpc represents less than 1 of the bacterial community and exhibits time lags of several days hpc data are widely used to assess the microbiological quality of drinking water and are incorporated into drinking water standards the present study confirmed the nonlinear relationships between hpc intact cell count icc and adenosine triphosphate atp in tap water samples stagnant and flushed by using a combination of icc atp and free chlorine data as inputs we show that hpc exceedance can be classified using a 2 layer feed forward artificial neural network ann despite the nonlinearity of hpc the best binary classification model showed accuracies of 95 sensitivity of

availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction bacterial growth in drinking water may lead to esthetic hygienic and systematic failures of drinking water treatments and distribution systems the heterotrophic plate count hpc method and its guidelines have been widely used as standards for determining the microbiological quality of drinking water for a century van nevel et al 2017 although hpc values do not have direct human health relevance abnormal changes i e numerical and statistical in hpc often indicate some failure of treatment unit and distribution networks allen et al 2004 sartory 2004 the hpc threshold is used to screen the acceptable hygienic water quality in various countries e g germany japan and korea francisque et al 2009 thus regular monitoring of the hpc level provides useful information for microbiologically related events and the deterioration of water quality francisque et al 2009 van nevel et al 2017 although it can be successfully used as a control measure for bacterial regrowth water monitoring for early hazard warning is limited by time consuming and labor intensive procedures van nevel et al 2017 which hinder rapid responses to a potential failure the hpc method requires an incubation period of at least 2 3 days and only reveals historical data therefore this method delays the implementation of countermeasures against microbial deterioration which is one of the main disadvantages of applying this method from a water utility perspective hpc is also relatively labor intensive compared to culture independent methods that do not rely on traditional laboratory culturing techniques factors such as the plate media temperature and laboratory settings can also bias hpc communities allen et al 2004 chowdhury 2012 many full scale water treatment and distribution systems have used culture independent assays such as flow cytometry fcm adenosine triphosphate atp and high throughput sequencing which can rapidly enumerate microbial quality and quantity cheswick et al 2019 prest et al 2016 van nevel et al 2016 while hpc can only detect less than 1 of total bacteria due to the presence of viable but non culturable cells berry et al 2006 lautenschlager et al 2010 culture independent assay covers both culturable and non culturable bacteria in drinking water total cell counts tcc indicate the total bacterial concentrations in bulk water whereas intact cell counts icc indicate bacteria with intact cell membranes berney et al 2008 hoefel et al 2003 atp levels are highly correlated with icc van nevel et al 2017 these culture independent methods reportedly enable rapid and accurate enumeration of biomass schönher et al 2021 van nevel et al 2016 2017 moreover in contrast to hpc culture independent methods can be monitored in real time and online full scale fcm studies have been conducted buysschaert et al 2018 farhat et al 2020 favere et al 2020 although water utilities favor culture independent methods in managing water supply assets and detecting failures more sensitively hassard and whitton 2019 the link between culture dependent and independent data is missing for regulatory compliance purposes for instance the culture independent data do not provide specific thresholds for drinking water hygiene hassard and whitton 2019 schönher et al 2021 in addition previous studies did not identify correlations among hpc tcc and icc results hoefel et al 2003 van nevel et al 2017 the relationship between fcm and hpc is nonlinear and site specific and several years of observations are required to determine the benefits of the relationship hassard and whitton 2019 artificial neural network ann was proposed in this study to reveal the link between culture independent e g fcm and atp and culture dependent data e g hpc recently researchers have suggested that machine learning models represent promising tools for water quality prediction these models often target time consuming and labor intensive tasks or uncharted water quality indices such as biochemical oxygen demand disinfection by products harmful algae discoloration and new features ahmed et al 2019 li et al 2021 ma et al 2020 mori et al 2022 nasir et al 2022 speight et al 2019 furthermore understanding the microbiological components in advance is also crucial for ensuring the biosafety of a water supply therefore the present study developed a binary classification model to predict the hpc criteria pass or failure in near real time the model developed in this study provides novel solutions for predicting hpc exceedance based on culture independent data for the first time we also discuss future applications to improve our model regarding input variables sample size designs and ann structures 2 materials and methods 2 1 tap water samples tap water samples were collected from a total of 10 randomly selected faucets within a 1 5 km radius in the same water service area gwangjin gu seoul korea two samples were collected from university buildings and seven samples were from households additionally one household sample was obtained from an external region ilsan kyunggi do korea tap water was collected biweekly throughout the sampling period january to june 2022 to understand overnight stagnation and hpc growth we sampled overnight stagnant and flushed water from the sampling sites n 70 for stagnant tap and n 72 for flushed tap lautenschlager et al 2010 in brief household residents were given two sterile 1 liter bottles and were instructed to allow the water to remain stagnant overnight 8 10 h of stagnation before collecting the samples the first liter of stagnant water samples was collected at 9 am the tap was then fully opened for one minute approximately 10 20 l were discarded and the flushed water sample was collected water temperature and ph were measured using a portable meter hq40d hach and subsequently all samples were refrigerated and analyzed within 4 h free chlorine was determined using colorimetric test kits via the n n diethyl p phenylenediamine method hach us moreover we incubated a series of stagnant and flushed tap water samples to check for extended stagnation along with the non incubated samples these samples helped us understand the simultaneous responses of hpc icc and atp during extended stagnation stagnant and flushed tap samples 30 ml were incubated for 48 h at 30 c in pre rinsed glass vials the residual chlorine was not quenched before incubation 2 2 heterotrophic plate count r2a all tap water samples were quenched with sodium thiosulfate 0 03 w v prior to microbial analysis the hpc was determined using r2a plate counts according to korean standard methods park et al 2019 autoclaved 30 ml r2a agar bd difco us was poured onto sterile plates after chilling the water samples were gently spread on triplicate agar plates the agar plates were stored at 20 2 c for three days in an incubator with digital temperature control after which the average colony forming units cfu were recorded according to standard methods samples that exceeded 200 cfu ml 1 were diluted incubated and enumerated bacterial culturability was calculated based on the ratio between hpc and flow cytometric cell counts i e hpc icc adopted from lautenschlager et al 2010 2 3 flow cytometry intact and damaged cell staining protocol sybr green i propidium iodide mixture was selected for fcm analysis after aliquoting 1 ml water samples into 1 5 ml amber microtubes each sample was incubated at 36 c for 10 min the final concentrations of sybr green i and propidium iodide staining dyes were 1 and 4 µm respectively van nevel et al 2016 the present study used cube 6 flow cytometer with a 488 nm blue laser source partec germany data was recorded via volumetric counting mode 200 μl with 2 μl s 1 flow rate owing to the low bacterial cell density we applied a minimum dilution of 2 before analysis and the cell count always ranged under 50 103 cell ml 1 to distinguish between low and high nucleic acid content bacteria lna and hna respectively in the intact cell region we applied the universal gates based on the fl1 channel green histogram fig s1 however a global consensus has not been reached on the icchna lna cell gating strategy which varies according to the cytometer used and user experience we did not consider damaged cell counts to predict the hpc the method detection limit mdl of icc was 173 cell ml 1 while the method quantification limit mql was 576 cell ml 1 additionally the mdls of the icchna and icc lna subpopulations were 19 and 176 cell ml 1 respectively while the mqls were 62 and 587 cell ml 1 respectively 2 4 adenosine triphosphate atp was determined using bactiter glo reagent promega us in brief the reagent was thawed and 100 µl aliquots were transferred to sterile 1 5 ml microtubes and then warmed up at 36 c for 1 min subsequently 100 µl of quenched tap water sample was gently mixed with the reagent and incubated for 30 s park et al 2019 a glomax 20 20 luminometer promega was used to determine relative luminescence units which were converted into ng atp ml 1 according to the standard calibration we only considered total atp but not microbial atp the mdl and mql of atp in this study were 4 and 13 ng l 1 respectively 2 5 statistics and visualization in this

engineering cortez et al 2009 rodríguez saavedra et al 2021 we built and optimized a neural network model using python tensorflow v2 0 and keras machine learning libraries the output variables hpc pass or failure were labeled as 0 or 1 respectively input variables such as icc hna lna cell counts total atp and free chlorine were normalized and used to supervise the classification model with different input scenarios we did not use water temperature and ph because of missing values and lower relevance to hpc exceedance in the present study data not shown training and test sets were separated into 70 and 30 of the raw datasets the design of the hidden layers of an ann is often arbitrary thus users must find the best model performance via trial and error in this study we compared the number of hidden layers size of the hidden nodes and activation function relu or hyperbolic tangent tanh fig s2 a sigmoid activation function was not considered in this study binary cross entropy was used for the model loss function furthermore early stopping was applied to prevent overfitting adam the most popular keras optimizer showed faster training time with lower model loss however we selected sgd because of its higher accuracy sensitivity and less overfitting fig s3 finally we compared the model metrics loss accuracy sensitivity and specificity with input scenarios and ann

temperature and ideal residence time for bacterial regrowth within the building plumbing lautenschlager et al 2010 montagnino et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 culturability rates were 1 5 2 8 and 0 0 0 1 for stagnant and flushed tap water samples respectively derived from hpc icc table s1 furthermore with the extension of stagnation the number of incubated samples from the stagnant taps showing hpc exceedance increased by 40 however incubation did not lead to hpc exceedance in the flushed samples because of the initial chlorine residues except in one case 3 2 relationships between flow cytometric cell counts atp and hpc we found no normality in the icc hna lna and atp distributions with positive skewness p 0 05 shapiro wilk test fig 2 consistent with van nevel et al 2017 we did not observe linear relationships between the hpc results and culture independent data such as cell counts and atp fig 2 however in the rank correlation hpc was nonlinearly related to the intact lna cell count spearman rho ρ 0 71 fig 2 although stagnation preferably increased the hna proportion 16 vs 8 for stagnant and flushed taps respectively the lna cell counts remained dominant in the stagnant tap water samples 83 11 of icc intact lna cells account for the remaining active cells in the chlorinated tap water samples as they are more resistant to disinfectants than hna liu et al 2017 ramseier et al 2011 heterotrophic lna likely survived in stressful environments and acted as the initial contributor to the tap water microbiome liu et al 2017 wang et al 2009 the presence of atp implies that lna cells may not have been dormant but rather active bacteria in our samples r 0 66 and ρ 0 62 fig 2 3 3 mean comparison between binary classes we compared the average biomass i e intact hna and lna cell counts and atp between the hpc pass and hpc fail groups to better understand the culture independent dataset for hpc classification two groups showed unequal variances in the icc hna lna and atp data p 0 05 levene s test we observed 4 1 7 6 103 and 30 8 11 6 103 cell ml 1 of intact cells for the hpc pass and hpc fail groups respectively values of 3 7 6 2 103 and 20 8 9 5 103 cell ml 1 were observed for lna cells in the hpc pass and hpc fail groups respectively while values of 0 9 2 5 103 and 10 0 7 9 103 cell ml 1 were observed for the hna cell counts in these groups respectively lna cell portions were more abundant than hna in both sample categories free chlorine residuals resulted in the lysis of hna cells in the flushed tap water ramseier et al 2011 whereas lna cells survived and grew under stressful conditions in the stagnant tap water lautenschlager et al 2010 zhang et al 2022 moreover stagnation reportedly increased the atp concentration of lna cells zhang et al 2022 and we observed that total atp concentrations in the hpc pass and hpc fail groups were 24 5 18 8 and 88 6 57 6 ng l 1 respectively although the mean comparison showed significant differences in biomass between the hpc pass and hpc fail groups p 0 01 via welch s t test fig 3 their concentrations fluctuated considerably in tap water the hpc pass group showed a bimodal data distribution whereas the hpc fail group showed a wider variance fig 3 therefore setting a numerical limit for hpc fail predictions was difficult due to the outliers in the hpc pass group fp we used the upper 99 confidence intervals of the hpc pass group as the thresholds between the groups 5 6 4 4 and 1 4 103 cell ml 1 for icc lna and hna respectively however the binary classification accuracies were 88 89 which was marginally higher than the baseline of the null model at 82 i e calculated from hpc pass total cases 164 201 3 4 unsupervised clustering nonlinear data dimension reduction umap and unsupervised clustering techniques were employed to group similar data without labeling and gain insights into potential classifiers among clusters three distinct clusters a c with decision boundaries were identified within the hyperplane notably cluster c exhibited a significantly higher concentration of icc 27 3 12 6 103 cell ml 1 compared to clusters a and b fig 4 a in terms of chlorine cluster a included only hpc pass samples and showed higher free chlorine levels 0 22 0 06 mg l 1 than the other two clusters fig 4b in line with these findings francisque et al 2009 reported that 0 30 mg l 1 free chlorine resulted in nil probability of hpc exceeding 50 cfu ml 1 only cluster c included hpc fail samples characterized by low chlorine levels and high icc potentially serving as classifiers this clustering approach facilitates rapid screening of complex datasets however it is important to note that the accuracy of unsupervised clustering for hpc pass and fail sample classification was 90 3 5 binary classification performance to predict hpc exceedance we selected the ann model using 48 and 8 nodes for the first and second hidden layers respectively with relu activation function fig 1 a quadrant plot shows the predicted versus true hpc labels in the test results n 61 and one example showed that the hpc label prediction was 95 accurate fig 5 the model accuracy was consistent over ten replications fig 6 the best model performance was found in input scenario 1 hna lna atp and free chlorine in terms of loss and accuracy figs 6a and b the worst accuracy was observed in the model with only free chlorine model 10 followed by models 8 atp and 5 atp free chlorine which had significantly lower accuracy compared with the other models p 0 01 therefore atp and free chlorine were less important variables for hpc exceedance predictions than the flow cytometric cell counts disinfection releases extracellular atp and microbial atp better reflects the active biomass nescerecka et al 2016 park et al 2016 recently online atp analyzers have supported microbial atp measurement thus a model based on microbial atp can be an alternative approach free chlorine was the most significant variable for hpc compliance prediction specificity of model 10 fig 6d which is consistent with the model developed by francisque et al 2009 however free chlorine decay could not predict hpc exceedance sensitivity of model 10 fig 6c generally the models with free chlorine data showed more stable performance with lower variances see models 1 vs 2 3 vs 7 and 6 vs 9 table s2 our model required icc and free chlorine as minimum input variables hna lna fingerprinting improved the model metrics but only by a small percentage fig 6 lna cell counts were the most important variable versus free chlorine hna cell counts and atp fig s4 additionally using index like fcm fingerprinting data as the input e g hna lna ratio lna hna and others did not provide any benefits probably due to collinearity however we suggest that the fingerprinting approach is still useful in terms of achieving low variance in the model metrics e g model 1 vs 4 we also note that the gating strategy between lna and hna remains subjective and future studies need to discuss how we can cluster two subpopulations without human bias 3 6 model optimization we further optimized the ann model based on the test accuracy we found that the number of hidden layers and activation functions can cause variations in model performance in this study shallow and deep ann models were compared i e single or more layers overall we found no difference between deep and shallow learning 94 1 vs 93 1 for deep and shallow learning respectively fig s2 however the sensitivity was significantly higher in the deep ann models 87 3 compared to the shallow ann models 80 3 which supports the need for deep learning to understand hpc exceedance furthermore the ann model with the relu activation function showed marginally better accuracy than that with the tanh function fig s2 however we note that the model optimization can vary by dataset and user thus requiring a trial and error approach for training with new data we suggest that the user validate the model performance by input variable size hidden node number training batch size training test set ratio sample shuffles and other parameters 3 7 sample size the sample size of the ann training set is one of the most important design factors but many classification studies have low sample sizes less than several hundred figueroa et al 2012 alwosheel et al 2018 mori et al 2022 to the best knowledge the optimum sample size can vary on the data properties and the complexity of the problem but several rules of thumb can be suggested first at least 75 samples per class are recommended beleites et al 2013 second the sample size should be at least 50 1000 times higher than the prediction classes alwosheel et al 2018 third it needs to be 10 100 times the number of input variables alwosheel et al 2018 for the small sample size we alternatively suggest bootstrapping to generate new random samples to construct better confidence intervals beleites et al 2013 fig s5 however bootstrapping relies on the original data distribution it cannot completely solve the sample bias and class imbalance for full scale data training the following dilemma must be discussed hpc exceedance rate is often skewed and rare in full scale distribution networks less than 5 francisque et al 2009 therefore a larger dataset with more sampling sites could not guarantee a robust model but lead to severe class imbalances in data collection the low sample size of hpc exceedance causes the overestimation of the null model accuracy the hpc pass group composition should be significantly lower than the target accuracy of the model for instance our model accuracy was 95 however the hpc pass group accounted for 82 of the dataset thus we recommend oversampling the minority class or undersampling the majority class for a larger sample size gomez alvarez and revetta 2020 lin et al 2017 nasir et al 2022 fig 7 3 8 new input variables the molecular technique provides direct information on the hpc community sala comorera et al 2017 the analysis of genus level and operational taxonomic unit otu data reportedly facilitates the construction of a binary classification model for bacterial failure associated with nitrification in distribution networks gomez alvarez and revetta 2020 however the molecular technique does not provide information on bacterial viability and the data are regarded as high dimensional fcm phenotypic fingerprinting may offer benefits as an alternative input feature recent fingerprinting studies have identified the instances of bacterial contamination and growth responsive to nutrients buysschaert et al 2019 props et al 2018 although hna lna fingerprinting did not improve the model accuracy we confirmed an increase in hna from 13 in hpc pass samples to 32 in hpc fail samples this suggests that the advanced fingerprinting feature may offer insights into the phenotypic differences in samples that exceed the hpc threshold furthermore residence time and seasonal variations influence microbial activity culturability phenotypic diversity and residual chlorine in the distribution network francisque et al 2009 prest et al 2016 schönher et al 2021 zhang et al 2022 seasonal data can be incorporated into the future models however classification performance also varies on the selection of input variables therefore input feature design should be carefully considered full scale water quality monitoring datasets often have high dimensionality with missing values li et al 2021 speight et al 2019 issues such as missing values the curse of dimensionality and collinearity among culture independent data present new challenges for future training 3 9 other limitations and suggestions ann is a black box model and important features must be identified in a high dimensional dataset cortez et al 2009 the present study showed the importance of lna icc and free chlorine however the lack of interpretability is still present in how input and target variables are nonlinearly connected the present model is not valid at the treatment plants but is useful for the distal distribution networks online fcm atp and other in situ sensors are expected to enable the real time warning scheme to detect hpc exceedance abnormal growth and contamination in end user taps and service reservoirs fig 7 the supervised weight of the ann can be site or disinfectant specific thus we suggest further training with historical data from the different disinfectant regimes e g chloramine or non disinfectant fig 7 biostability has gained more attention in disinfectant free systems in several european countries therefore new training with culture independent data can provide additional benefits in these countries 4 conclusions the present study proposes a model to predict hpc exceedance it uses a combination of fcm atp and free chlorine data in a two layer feed forward ann model to make predictive classifications the model overcomes the culture dependence and time delay limitation of hpc offering near real time insight consistent with established and well understood regulations and practices to help ensure biostable and safe drinking water stagnation and free chlorine decay increased the occurrence of hpc in tap water whereas the flushed tap water had no hpc exceedance events nonlinear relationships exist between the hpc results and culture independent data a two layer feed forward ann model using inputs of free chlorine atp icc hna and or lna can usefully predict the binary hpc classes intact and lna cell counts as well as free chlorine residuals are important features for the nonlinear prediction of hpc exceedance the model has 95 2 accuracy in predicting hpc exceedance over tap water samples including

14621,culture independent data can be utilized to identify heterotrophic plate count hpc exceedances in drinking water although hpc represents less than 1 of the bacterial community and exhibits time lags of several days hpc data are widely used to assess the microbiological quality of drinking water and are incorporated into drinking water standards the present study confirmed the nonlinear relationships between hpc intact cell count icc and adenosine triphosphate atp in tap water samples stagnant and flushed by using a combination of icc atp and free chlorine data as inputs we show that hpc exceedance can be classified using a 2 layer feed forward artificial neural network ann despite the nonlinearity of hpc the best binary classification model showed accuracies of 95 sensitivity of 91 and specificity of 96 icc and chlorine concentrations were the most important features for classifiers the main limitations such as sample size and class imbalance were also discussed the present model provides the ability to convert data from emerging measurement techniques into established and well understood measures overcoming culture dependence and offering near real time data to help ensure the biostability and safety of drinking water graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords free chlorine flow cytometry heterotrophic plate count machine learning tap water data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction bacterial growth in drinking water may lead to esthetic hygienic and systematic failures of drinking water treatments and distribution systems the heterotrophic plate count hpc method and its guidelines have been widely used as standards for determining the microbiological quality of drinking water for a century van nevel et al 2017 although hpc values do not have direct human health relevance abnormal changes i e numerical and statistical in hpc often indicate some failure of treatment unit and distribution networks allen et al 2004 sartory 2004 the hpc threshold is used to screen the acceptable hygienic water quality in various countries e g germany japan and korea francisque et al 2009 thus regular monitoring of the hpc level provides useful information for microbiologically related events and the deterioration of water quality francisque et al 2009 van nevel et al 2017 although it can be successfully used as a control measure for bacterial regrowth water monitoring for early hazard warning is limited by time consuming and labor intensive procedures van nevel et al 2017 which hinder rapid responses to a potential failure the hpc method requires an incubation period of at least 2 3 days and only reveals historical data therefore this method delays the implementation of countermeasures against microbial deterioration which is one of the main disadvantages of applying this method from a water utility perspective hpc is also relatively labor intensive compared to culture independent methods that do not rely on traditional laboratory culturing techniques factors such as the plate media temperature and laboratory settings can also bias hpc communities allen et al 2004 chowdhury 2012 many full scale water treatment and distribution systems have used culture independent assays such as flow cytometry fcm adenosine triphosphate atp and high throughput sequencing which can rapidly enumerate microbial quality and quantity cheswick et al 2019 prest et al 2016 van nevel et al 2016 while hpc can only detect less than 1 of total bacteria due to the presence of viable but non culturable cells berry et al 2006 lautenschlager et al 2010 culture independent assay covers both culturable and non culturable bacteria in drinking water total cell counts tcc indicate the total bacterial concentrations in bulk water whereas intact cell counts icc indicate bacteria with intact cell membranes berney et al 2008 hoefel et al 2003 atp levels are highly correlated with icc van nevel et al 2017 these culture independent methods reportedly enable rapid and accurate enumeration of biomass schönher et al 2021 van nevel et al 2016 2017 moreover in contrast to hpc culture independent methods can be monitored in real time and online full scale fcm studies have been conducted buysschaert et al 2018 farhat et al 2020 favere et al 2020 although water utilities favor culture independent methods in managing water supply assets and detecting failures more sensitively hassard and whitton 2019 the link between culture dependent and independent data is missing for regulatory compliance purposes for instance the culture independent data do not provide specific thresholds for drinking water hygiene hassard and whitton 2019 schönher et al 2021 in addition previous studies did not identify correlations among hpc tcc and icc results hoefel et al 2003 van nevel et al 2017 the relationship between fcm and hpc is nonlinear and site specific and several years of observations are required to determine the benefits of the relationship hassard and whitton 2019 artificial neural network ann was proposed in this study to reveal the link between culture independent e g fcm and atp and culture dependent data e g hpc recently researchers have suggested that machine learning models represent promising tools for water quality prediction these models often target time consuming and labor intensive tasks or uncharted water quality indices such as biochemical oxygen demand disinfection by products harmful algae discoloration and new features ahmed et al 2019 li et al 2021 ma et al 2020 mori et al 2022 nasir et al 2022 speight et al 2019 furthermore understanding the microbiological components in advance is also crucial for ensuring the biosafety of a water supply therefore the present study developed a binary classification model to predict the hpc criteria pass or failure in near real time the model developed in this study provides novel solutions for predicting hpc exceedance based on culture independent data for the first time we also discuss future applications to improve our model regarding input variables sample size designs and ann structures 2 materials and methods 2 1 tap water samples tap water samples were collected from a total of 10 randomly selected faucets within a 1 5 km radius in the same water service area gwangjin gu seoul korea two samples were collected from university buildings and seven samples were from households additionally one household sample was obtained from an external region ilsan kyunggi do korea tap water was collected biweekly throughout the sampling period january to june 2022 to understand overnight stagnation and hpc growth we sampled overnight stagnant and flushed water from the sampling sites n 70 for stagnant tap and n 72 for flushed tap lautenschlager et al 2010 in brief household residents were given two sterile 1 liter bottles and were instructed to allow the water to remain stagnant overnight 8 10 h of stagnation before collecting the samples the first liter of stagnant water samples was collected at 9 am the tap was then fully opened for one minute approximately 10 20 l were discarded and the flushed water sample was collected water temperature and ph were measured using a portable meter hq40d hach and subsequently all samples were refrigerated and analyzed within 4 h free chlorine was determined using colorimetric test kits via the n n diethyl p phenylenediamine method hach us moreover we incubated a series of stagnant and flushed tap water samples to check for extended stagnation along with the non incubated samples these samples helped us understand the simultaneous responses of hpc icc and atp during extended stagnation stagnant and flushed tap samples 30 ml were incubated for 48 h at 30 c in pre rinsed glass vials the residual chlorine was not quenched before incubation 2 2 heterotrophic plate count r2a all tap water samples were quenched with sodium thiosulfate 0 03 w v prior to microbial analysis the hpc was determined using r2a plate counts according to korean standard methods park et al 2019 autoclaved 30 ml r2a agar bd difco us was poured onto sterile plates after chilling the water samples were gently spread on triplicate agar plates the agar plates were stored at 20 2 c for three days in an incubator with digital temperature control after which the average colony forming units cfu were recorded according to standard methods samples that exceeded 200 cfu ml 1 were diluted incubated and enumerated bacterial culturability was calculated based on the ratio between hpc and flow cytometric cell counts i e hpc icc adopted from lautenschlager et al 2010 2 3 flow cytometry intact and damaged cell staining protocol sybr green i propidium iodide mixture was selected for fcm analysis after aliquoting 1 ml water samples into 1 5 ml amber microtubes each sample was incubated at 36 c for 10 min the final concentrations of sybr green i and propidium iodide staining dyes were 1 and 4 µm respectively van nevel et al 2016 the present study used cube 6 flow cytometer with a 488 nm blue laser source partec germany data was recorded via volumetric counting mode 200 μl with 2 μl s 1 flow rate owing to the low bacterial cell density we applied a minimum dilution of 2 before analysis and the cell count always ranged under 50 103 cell ml 1 to distinguish between low and high nucleic acid content bacteria lna and hna respectively in the intact cell region we applied the universal gates based on the fl1 channel green histogram fig s1 however a global consensus has not been reached on the icchna lna cell gating strategy which varies according to the cytometer used and user experience we did not consider damaged cell counts to predict the hpc the method detection limit mdl of icc was 173 cell ml 1 while the method quantification limit mql was 576 cell ml 1 additionally the mdls of the icchna and icc lna subpopulations were 19 and 176 cell ml 1 respectively while the mqls were 62 and 587 cell ml 1 respectively 2 4 adenosine triphosphate atp was determined using bactiter glo reagent promega us in brief the reagent was thawed and 100 µl aliquots were transferred to sterile 1 5 ml microtubes and then warmed up at 36 c for 1 min subsequently 100 µl of quenched tap water sample was gently mixed with the reagent and incubated for 30 s park et al 2019 a glomax 20 20 luminometer promega was used to determine relative luminescence units which were converted into ng atp ml 1 according to the standard calibration we only considered total atp but not microbial atp the mdl and mql of atp in this study were 4 and 13 ng l 1 respectively 2 5 statistics and visualization in this study python v3 8 13 was used for statistical analysis and ann source codes the statsmodels v0 13 2 library was used for hypothesis validation and the mean comparisons shapiro wilk test levene s t

seaborn v0 11 2 in the model validation true positive tp and negative tn indicate true labeled hpc exceedance and compliance respectively false positive fp and negative fn indicate incorrectly labeled hpc groups sensitivity refers to a true positive rate a metric to screen hpc exceedance correctly specificity is a rate to detect true negative samples hpc compliance accuracy is a measure of overall

engineering cortez et al 2009 rodríguez saavedra et al 2021 we built and optimized a neural network model using python tensorflow v2 0 and keras machine learning libraries the output variables hpc pass or failure were labeled as 0 or 1 respectively input variables such as icc hna lna cell counts total atp and free chlorine were normalized and used to supervise the classification model with different input scenarios we did not use water temperature and ph because of missing values and lower relevance to hpc exceedance in the present study data not shown training and test sets were separated into 70 and 30 of the raw datasets the design of the hidden layers of an ann is often arbitrary thus users must find the best model performance via trial and error in this study we compared the number of hidden layers size of the hidden nodes and activation function relu or hyperbolic tangent tanh fig s2 a sigmoid activation function was not considered in this study binary cross entropy was used for the model loss function furthermore early stopping was applied to prevent overfitting adam the most popular keras optimizer showed faster training time with lower model loss however we selected sgd because of its higher accuracy sensitivity and less overfitting fig s3 finally we compared the model metrics loss accuracy sensitivity and specificity with input scenarios and ann structures input variable importance was calculated by the eli5 python package the model schematics parameters and training steps are shown in fig 1 source codes are available at https github com jwpark8890 hpc binary class 3 results and discussion 3 1 heterotrophic plate counts in tap water hpc ranged from 0 to 11 526 cfu ml 1 in the tap water samples fig 2 hpc in the flushed water sample was non detectable or below the 100 cfu ml 1 due to the higher free chlorine residuals 0 22 0 08 mg l 1 whereas the stagnant tap water samples showed the decay of free chlorine 0 02 0 04 mg l 1 hpc counts in stagnant water highly fluctuated table s1 and its median and average were 0 and 379 cfu ml 1 however only 21 of the stagnant tap water samples exceeded hpc criteria in korea less than 100 cfu ml 1 fig 2 we found that 51 of the stagnant samples were still negative when observing a single colony hpc exceedance was also site specific in two locations it could originate and grow from local biofilms on contaminated plumbing and faucet huck and gagnon 2004 lipphaus et al 2014 overnight stagnation significantly increased the occurrence of culturable heterotrophs due to the disinfectant decay indoor temperature and ideal residence time for bacterial regrowth within the building plumbing lautenschlager et al 2010 montagnino et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 culturability rates were 1 5 2 8 and 0 0 0 1 for stagnant and flushed tap water samples respectively derived from hpc icc table s1 furthermore with the extension of stagnation the number of incubated samples from the stagnant taps showing hpc exceedance increased by 40 however incubation did not lead to hpc exceedance in the flushed samples because of the initial chlorine residues except in one case 3 2 relationships between flow cytometric cell counts atp and hpc we found no normality in the icc hna lna and atp distributions with positive skewness p 0 05 shapiro wilk test fig 2 consistent with van nevel et al 2017 we did not observe linear relationships between the hpc results and culture independent data such as cell counts and atp fig 2 however in the rank correlation hpc was nonlinearly related to the intact lna cell

cells may not have been dormant but rather active bacteria in our samples r 0 66 and ρ 0 62 fig 2 3 3 mean comparison between binary classes we compared the average biomass i e intact hna and lna cell counts and atp between the hpc pass and hpc fail groups to better understand the culture independent dataset for hpc classification two groups showed unequal variances in the icc hna lna and atp data p 0 05 levene s test we observed 4 1 7 6 103 and 30 8 11 6 103 cell ml 1 of intact cells for the hpc pass and hpc fail groups respectively values of 3 7 6 2 103 and 20 8 9 5 103 cell ml 1 were observed for lna cells in the hpc pass and hpc fail groups respectively while values of 0 9 2 5 103 and 10 0 7 9 103 cell ml 1 were observed for the hna cell counts in these groups respectively lna cell portions were more abundant than hna in both sample categories free chlorine residuals resulted in the lysis of hna cells in the flushed tap water ramseier et al 2011 whereas lna cells survived and grew under stressful conditions in the stagnant tap water lautenschlager et al 2010 zhang et al 2022 moreover stagnation reportedly increased the atp concentration of lna cells zhang et al 2022 and we observed that total atp concentrations in the hpc pass and hpc fail groups were 24 5 18 8 and 88 6 57 6 ng l 1 respectively although the mean comparison showed significant differences in biomass between the hpc pass and hpc fail groups p 0 01 via welch s t test fig 3 their concentrations fluctuated considerably in tap water the hpc pass group showed a bimodal data distribution whereas the hpc fail group showed a wider variance fig 3 therefore setting a numerical limit for hpc fail predictions was difficult due to the outliers in the hpc pass group fp we used the upper 99 confidence intervals of the hpc pass group as the thresholds between the groups 5 6 4 4 and 1 4 103 cell ml 1 for icc lna and hna respectively however the binary classification accuracies were 88 89 which was marginally higher than the baseline of the null model at 82 i e calculated from hpc pass total cases 164 201 3 4 unsupervised clustering nonlinear data dimension reduction umap and unsupervised clustering techniques were employed to group similar data without labeling and gain insights into potential classifiers among clusters three distinct clusters a c with decision boundaries were identified within the hyperplane notably cluster c exhibited a significantly higher concentration of icc 27 3 12 6 103 cell ml 1 compared to clusters a and b fig 4 a in terms of chlorine cluster a included only hpc pass samples and showed higher free chlorine levels 0 22 0 06 mg l 1 than the other two clusters fig 4b in line with these findings francisque et al 2009 reported that 0 30 mg l 1 free chlorine resulted in nil probability of hpc exceeding 50 cfu ml 1 only cluster c included hpc fail samples characterized by low chlorine levels and high icc potentially serving as classifiers this clustering approach facilitates rapid screening of complex datasets however it is important to note that the accuracy of unsupervised clustering for hpc pass and fail sample classification was 90

variable for hpc compliance prediction specificity of model 10 fig 6d which is consistent with the model developed by francisque et al 2009 however free chlorine decay could not predict hpc exceedance sensitivity of model 10 fig 6c generally the models with free chlorine data showed more stable performance with lower variances see models 1 vs 2 3 vs 7 and 6 vs 9 table s2 our model required icc and free chlorine as minimum input variables hna lna fingerprinting improved the model metrics but only by a small percentage fig 6 lna cell counts were the most important variable versus free chlorine hna cell counts and atp fig s4 additionally using index like fcm fingerprinting data as the input e g hna lna ratio lna hna and others did not provide any benefits probably due to collinearity however we suggest that the fingerprinting approach is still useful in terms of achieving low variance in the model metrics e g model 1 vs 4 we also note that the gating strategy between lna and hna remains subjective and future studies need to discuss how we can cluster two subpopulations without human bias 3 6 model optimization we further optimized the ann model based on the test accuracy we found that the number of hidden layers and activation functions can cause variations in model performance in this study shallow and deep ann models were compared i e single or more layers overall we found no difference between deep and shallow learning 94 1 vs 93 1 for deep and shallow learning respectively fig s2 however the sensitivity was significantly higher in the deep ann models 87 3 compared to the shallow ann models 80 3 which supports the need for deep learning to understand hpc exceedance furthermore the ann model with the relu activation function showed marginally better accuracy than that with the tanh function fig s2 however we note that the model optimization can vary by dataset and user thus requiring a trial and error approach for training with new data we suggest that the user validate the model performance by input variable size hidden node number training batch size training test set ratio sample shuffles and other parameters 3 7 sample size the sample size of the ann training set is one of the most important design factors but many classification studies have low sample sizes less than several hundred figueroa et al 2012 alwosheel et al 2018 mori et al 2022 to the best knowledge the optimum sample size can vary on the data properties and the complexity of the problem but several rules of thumb can be suggested first at least 75 samples per class are recommended beleites et al 2013 second the sample size should be at least 50 1000 times higher than the prediction classes alwosheel et al 2018 third it needs to be 10 100 times the number of input variables alwosheel et al 2018 for the small sample size we alternatively suggest bootstrapping to generate new random samples to construct better confidence intervals beleites et al 2013 fig s5 however bootstrapping relies on the original data distribution it cannot completely solve the sample bias and class imbalance for full scale data training the following dilemma must be discussed hpc exceedance rate is often skewed and rare in full scale distribution networks less than 5 francisque et al 2009 therefore a larger dataset with more sampling sites could not guarantee a robust model but lead to severe class imbalances in data collection the low sample size of hpc exceedance causes the overestimation of the null model accuracy the hpc pass group composition should be significantly lower than the target accuracy of the model for instance our model accuracy was 95 however the hpc pass group accounted for 82 of the dataset thus we recommend oversampling the minority class or undersampling the majority class for a larger sample size gomez alvarez and revetta 2020 lin et al 2017 nasir et al 2022 fig 7 3 8 new input variables the molecular technique provides direct information on the hpc community sala comorera et al 2017 the analysis of genus level and operational taxonomic unit otu data reportedly facilitates the construction of a binary classification model for bacterial failure associated with nitrification in distribution networks gomez alvarez and revetta 2020 however the molecular technique does not provide information on bacterial viability and the data are regarded as high dimensional fcm phenotypic fingerprinting may offer benefits as an alternative input feature recent fingerprinting studies have identified the instances of bacterial contamination and growth responsive to nutrients buysschaert et al 2019 props et al 2018 although hna lna fingerprinting did not improve the model accuracy we confirmed an increase in hna from 13 in hpc pass samples to 32 in hpc fail samples this suggests that the advanced fingerprinting feature may offer insights into the phenotypic differences in samples that exceed the hpc threshold furthermore residence time and seasonal variations influence microbial activity culturability phenotypic diversity and residual chlorine in the distribution network francisque et al 2009 prest et al 2016 schönher et al 2021 zhang et al 2022 seasonal data can be incorporated into the future models however classification performance also varies on the selection of input variables therefore input feature design should be carefully considered full scale water quality monitoring datasets often have high dimensionality with missing values li et al 2021 speight et al 2019 issues such as missing values the curse of dimensionality and collinearity among culture independent data present new challenges for future training 3 9 other limitations and suggestions ann is a black box model and important features must be identified in a high dimensional dataset cortez et al 2009 the present study showed the importance of lna icc and free chlorine however the lack of interpretability is still present in how input and target variables are nonlinearly connected the present model is not valid at the treatment plants but is useful for the distal distribution networks online fcm atp and other in situ sensors are expected to enable the real time warning scheme to detect hpc exceedance abnormal growth and contamination in end user taps and service reservoirs fig 7 the supervised weight of the ann can be site or disinfectant specific thus we suggest further training with historical data from the different disinfectant regimes e g chloramine or non disinfectant fig 7 biostability has gained more attention in disinfectant free systems in several european countries therefore new training with culture independent data can provide additional benefits in these countries 4 conclusions the present study proposes a model to predict hpc exceedance it uses a combination of fcm atp and free chlorine data in a two layer feed forward ann model to make predictive classifications the model overcomes the culture dependence and time delay limitation of hpc offering near real time insight consistent with established and well understood regulations and practices to help ensure biostable and safe drinking water stagnation and free chlorine decay increased the occurrence of hpc in tap water whereas the flushed tap water had no hpc exceedance events nonlinear relationships exist between the hpc results and culture independent data a two layer feed forward ann model using inputs of free chlorine atp icc hna and or lna can usefully predict the binary hpc classes intact and lna cell counts as well as free chlorine residuals are important features for the nonlinear prediction of hpc exceedance the model has 95 2 accuracy in predicting hpc exceedance over tap water samples including

14622,a fundamental problem in lake eutrophication management is that the nutrient chlorophyll a chl a relationship shows high variability due to diverse influences of for example lake depth lake trophic status and latitude to accommodate the variability induced by spatial heterogeneity a reliable and general insight into the nutrient chl a relationship may be achieved by applying probabilistic methods to analyze data compiled across a broad spatial scale here the roles of two critical factors determining the nutrient chl a relationship lake depth and trophic status were explored by applying bayesian networks bns and a bayesian hierarchical linear regression model bhm to a compiled global dataset from 2849 lakes and 25083 observations we categorized the lakes into three groups shallow transitional and deep according to mean and maximum depth relative to mixing depth we found that despite a stronger effect of total phosphorus tp and total nitrogen tn on chl a when combined tp played a dominant role in determining chl a regardless of lake depth however when the lake was hypereutrophic and or tp was 40 μg l tn had a greater impact on chl a especially in shallow lakes the response curve of chl a to tp and tn varied with lake depth with deep lakes having the lowest yield chl a per unit of nutrient followed by transitional lakes while shallow lakes had the highest ratio moreover we found a decrease of tn tp with increasing chl a concentrations and lake depth represented as mixing depth mean depth our established bhm may help estimating lake type and or lake specific acceptable tn and tp concentrations that comply with target chl a concentrations with higher certainty than can be obtained when bulking all lake types graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords eutrophication nutrients chlorophyll a lake depth bayesian networks bayesian hierarchical linear regression model abbreviations eu eutrophication nut nutrients chl a chlorophyll a ld lake depth bns bayesian networks bhm bayesian hierarchical linear regression model 1 introduction freshwater eutrophication is a major global problem and phytoplankton blooms in lakes have increased globally since the 1980s ho et al 2019 enrichment of nutrients including phosphorus p and nitrogen n is considered the main driver of phytoplankton growth based on the strong empirical relationship between phytoplankton biomass and chlorophyll a chl a and p p reduction with the aim of decreasing the phytoplankton biomass is often the first measure taken to control eutrophication this is a long standing paradigm in lake management carpenter 2008 filstrup et al 2014 however several studies have challenged this p control paradigm pointing out that the effect of n on lake ecosystems is underestimated a large scale meta analysis of experimental enrichment showed that n and p limitation is equivalent in almost all situations elser et al 2007 studies based on hundreds of lakes in 17 north eastern and mid west us states found that p limitation is more likely to occur under oligo mesotrophic or eutrophic chl a conditions while co limitation of p and n occurs at hypereutrophic chl a liang et al 2020 many case studies have also found successful eutrophication control by combined n and p reduction or reduction of n alone abell et al 2010 kolzau et al 2014 maberly et al 2020 as different methods and strategies are needed for n and p control and the associated costs differ it is critical to select an appropriate strategy for p n or n p control in lake eutrophication management lake morphological characteristics such as lake depth may also play a critical role in determining nutrient chl a relationship and lake eutrophication migration strategy søndergaard et al 2017 and qin et al 2020 pointed out that differences in in lake nutrient dynamics between shallow and deep lakes may play a critical role in determining the response of chl a to nutrients internal p loading for example is especially important in shallow lakes søndergaard et al 2003 there is also evidence that the role of n might be stronger in shallow lakes as the loss by denitrification is higher here due to e g better contact between water and sediment making n a potential limiting factor in summer jeppesen et al 2007 søndergaard et al 2017 moreover there is a higher risk of loss of submerged macrophytes at high n as evidenced in several experiments e g olsen et al 2015 søndergaard et al 2007 being supported also by field data jeppesen et al 2007 furthermore phillips et al 2008 revealed that shallow lakes have a higher yield of chl a per nutrient unit of p and n than deep lakes implying that lower nutrient levels are needed in shallow lakes than in deep lakes to pass a desired chl a concentration therefore setting appropriate nutrient criteria based on the response of chl a to nutrients for different lake types is a fundamental task for lake managers to achieve cost effective eutrophication control many studies have used historical observations whole lake experiments in a single lake or observations in a few selected lakes to identify the limiting factors for phytoplankton growth and to investigate the potential control strategies and responses of chl a to nutrients paerl et al 2016 qin et al 2019 schindler et al 2016 while providing useful information inferences from small scale geographical observations may be constrained to local ecological conditions liang et al 2020 and limited to individual lakes or sets of lakes phillips et al 2008 as the nutrient chl a relationship may vary temporally and geographically abell et al 2010 paerl et al 2016 canfield et al 2019 jeppesen et al 2020 more universal relationship can be deduced by using datasets of lakes covering large ecological and climate gradients janssen et al 2019 jeppesen et al 2020 some studies based on local scale datasets have been conducted using data driven predicted models such as regression equations to investigate the nutrient chl a relationship and to determine the nutrient that is limiting the phytoplankton growth abell et al 2010 elser et al 2007 huang et al 2020 liang et al 2020 phillips et al 2008 poikane et al 2019 however a comprehensive analytical framework suitable for handling the uncertainty induced by spatial heterogeneity when exploring the relationship between nutrients and chl a is lacking a model based on data covering broad conditions and a comprehensive analytical framework may provide more general and reliable insight into the nutrient chl a relationship and moreover be directly applied to different type of lakes including lakes with limited data or low frequency sampling to elucidate the complex processes associated with the nutrient chl a relationship as well as to accommodate the variability of nutrient chl a induced by spatial heterogeneity we used a probabilistic machine learning analytical framework bayesian networks bns pearl 1985 and a bayesian hierarchical linear regression model bhm malakoff 1999 an approach widely used in ecosystems modelling e g cha et al 2016 feki sahnoun et al 2017 malve and qian 2006 mellios et al 2020 liang et al 2020 the bayesian hierarchical linear regression model bhm estimate parameters by integrating information from multiple sources and handle uncertainty in a probabilistic manner chen and pollino 2012 malve and qian 2006 mellios et al 2020 moreover methods based on bayes theorem provide a mutually verified analytical framework that ensures reliable results thus the objectives of this study were to 1 elucidate the role of n p or both are the potential most important growth limiting factor for phytoplankton chl a in lakes across broad spatial scales and trophic status gradients 2 examine whether the potential limiting nutrient varies with lake depth 3 test bhm to estimate how changes in nutrient concentrations may alter the probability of chl a concentrations to provide detailed information for lake eutrophication management decisions and nutrient criteria and 4 examine to what extent the response curve of chl a to nutrient concentrations varies with lake depth the analysis is based on a dataset comprising 2849 lakes globally 2 materials and methods 2 1 dataset we integrated several regional lake monitoring datasets including the geospatial and temporal database of us lakes lagos soranno et al 2017 european lake monitoring data collected by the european environment agency member countries waterbase lakes https www eea europa eu data and maps data waterbase lakes 10 the china lake scientific database http www lakesci csdb cn and water quality data from yunnan plateau lakes monitored by the environmental monitoring station of yunnan province we conducted a quality control of the compiled data as follows first we removed extreme values defined as chl a 400 μg l and 1 μg l we then selected data collected from june to september the growing season to minimize the influence of temperature discrepancy caused by diverse latitudes and altitudes moreover to investigate potential differences in the nutrient chl a relationship related to lake morphometry recordings of surface area and maximum and mean depth of a number of lakes without documented data on these parameters were drawn from the hydrolakes database messager et al 2016 according to their geographical location a total of 25083 observations of tn tp and chl a from 2849 lakes table 1 fig 1 were used in the analysis of these 2849 lakes 1324 had only one observation while for the remaining lakes the observations ranged from 2 to 354 the average number per lake being 8 8 there are 21 lakes that have more than 100 observations in our database 2088 lakes were from the us 705 from europe and 56 from china 2 2 categorization of lakes the categorization of lakes for lake specific models is often based on the assumption that lakes belonging to a particular type exhibit a similar response of chl a to the stressor tp and or tn malve and qian 2006 canfield et al 2019 mellios et al 2020 for example due to limited information on geographical and natural characteristics of their study lakes malve and qian 2006 classified 2289 finnish lakes into nine groups based on mean depth and humic type and qin et al 2020 classified their study lakes into three groups based on lake depth however for more global datasets detailed information of lake characteristics are lacking it is critical to apply effective tools to quantify the chl a nutrient response to the most influential factors while taking into account the data limitation that often exists when exploring these nutrient chl a relationships at macroscale as numerous local studies have shown that lake depth plays an important role in the chl a nutrient response malve and qian 2006 mellios et al 2020 søndergaard et al 2017 qin et al 2020 we divided our lakes according to depth following qin et al 2020 into three groups shallow transitional and deep based on lake mixing depth zmix mean depth zmean and maximum depth zmax i e shallow lakes are those with mixing depths exceeding the maximum depth transitional lakes are those with a mean depth mixing depth maximum depth and the deep lakes are those with mixing depths lower than the mean depth the mixing depth was estimated using lake area zmix 100 185log a 0 842 2 37 1 05 where a is the area of the lake surface km2 hanna 1990 2 3 bayesian networks being a widely used and powerful probabilistic graphical modeling technique the bayesian networks bns method pearl 1985 allows investigation of the implicit relationship between variables in a probabilistic manner even when the relationship involves uncertainty the method is particularly useful when data are integrated across varied ecological conditions therefore a bns model was established to investigate whether the nutrient limitation of chl a varied with lake type a bns model uses nodes variables of interest including parent nodes and child nodes and edges the connections among nodes to represent dependency relationships among nodes we developed a simple bns model with tn tp and lake depth as drivers parent nodes and chl a as the response variable child node although continuous variables can be dealt with to some extent in bns uusitalo 2007 the usual solution is to discretize the variables to avoid overly complicated algorithms and time consuming computation aguilera et al 2012 feki sahnoun et al 2017 liang et al 2020 uusitalo 2007 we adapted a lake eutrophication management oriented method for discretization of tn tp and chl a which defined tn tp and chl a as oligo mesotrophic tp 25 μg l tn 750 μg l chl a 7 μg l eutrophic 25 tp 50 μg l 750 tn 1400 μg l 7 chl a 30 μg l and hypereutrophic tp 50 μg l tn 1400 μg l chl a 30 μg l usepa 2009 the discretization of the lake depth was the same as that of lake classification the discretization data on tn tp chl a and lake depth tn tp and chl a are expressed as trophic status and lake depth as water depth type were used as input and output for the bns model thus the established bns model has three network parent nodes tn tp and lake depth with three states of each parent node and one network child node chl a with three states we used the r package of bnlearn to estimate the parameters and evaluate model performance scutari 2010 a 10 fold cross validation strategy in which the model was fitted 10 times to 90 observations while the remaining 10 was retained for out of sample prediction was adapted to assess the established model classification accuracy the classification accuracy was 68 8 which is satisfactory and ensures the reliability of established bns model the calibrated bns model can provide the possibility of chl a trophic status under certain trophic status of tn and tp and certain lake depth type for example we can get the probability of chl a being eutrophic when setting tn to be eutrophic tp to be hypereutrophic and lake depth to be shallow 2 4 bayesian hierarchical linear regression model the bayesian hierarchical linear regression model bhm has proven effective and suitable in studies modeling the nutrient chl a relationship malve and qian 2006 a hierarchical model can obtain enough parameters from information pooling based on different levels to form a realistic and hierarchical model without overfitting the data gelman et al 2013 here we used an established bhm based on a dataset covering different lake depths and trophic states to pool information within and among lake types the bhm used induced a lake specific curve of the nutrient chl a response 1 log chl a i j k n o r m a l β 0 i j β 1 i j log t

of determination r squared r2 absolute mean error ame and root mean square error rmse were used to assess the accuracy and precision of the model fit 3 results 3 1 the role of tp and tn in differential depth lakes the statistics and boxplots of tn tp and chl a for the different groups of lakes are shown in table 1 and fig 2 we observed an increase in the growing season concentrations of tn tp and chl a with decreasing lake depth and the difference between shallow transitional and deep lakes were statistically significant permutation test p 0 0001 even when a lake had the same trophic status the concentrations of tn tp and chl a in the shallow lakes were highest among the three lake groups although a higher mean chl a concentration was related to higher mean tn and tp concentrations in all groups lake depth seems to play an important role for the algal biomass we explored the role of lake depth for the nutrient chl a relationship using the results of established bns model for the probabilities of chl a trophic status under different combinations of tn and tp trophic states fig 3 we found that 27 0 of the shallow lakes were classified as eutrophic or hypereutrophic when the nutrient state was oligo mesotrophic while 25 1 of the transitional lakes and 17 9 of the deep lakes were in belonged to these categories fig 3 a moreover when the trophic status of tn and tp changes from oligo mesotrophic to eutrophic or hypereutrophic the probability of chl a trophic status being eutrophic or hypereutrophic increased sharply in all lake groups among the three groups 82 6 of the shallow lakes 84 4 of the transitional lakes and 80 7 of the deep lakes were now eutrophic or hypereutrophic state when the nutrients reached the eutrophic state while 95 0 of the shallow lakes 88 7 of the transitional lakes and 86 2 of the deep lakes were eutrophic or hypereutrophic when the nutrients reached a hypereutrophic state fig 3 a 3 e and 3 i these results showed that the increase in tn and tp concentrations in lakes induces an increase in the chl a concentration at macroscale being most pronounced in shallow lakes 3 2 the role of tp and tn in differential trophic status lakes comparing chl a trophic status with one nutrient fixed and one variable allowed us to explore the relative effect of nutrients on chl a as shown in fig 3 a 3 b and 3 c an oligo mesotrophic tn trophic state that changes the tp state from oligo mesotrophic to eutrophic or hypereutrophic resulted in a decrease in the probability of chl a being oligo mesotrophic for all lakes probability of a decline 0 65 0 60 and 0 64 for shallow transitional and deep lakes respectively when tp is eutrophic and an increase in the probability of chl a tropic status being eutrophic and hypereutrophic in contrast when the constant tp trophic state was oligo mesotrophic and the tn state changed from oligo mesotrophic to eutrophic or hypereutrophic there was a relatively small decrease in the probability of chl a trophic status being oligo mesotrophic for instance a shift in tn from oligo mesotrophic to hypereutrophic led to a 26 3 0 73 0 47 shift of shallow lakes from an oligo mesotrophic to a eutrophic or hypereutrophic state which is smaller than the transfers resulting from a shift in tp 64 6 0 73 0 08 these results show that while both tn and tp influence chl a tp seems to overall play a more important role consistent with the above mentioned results when tp and tn trophic statuses are hypereutrophic and oligo mesotrophic respectively the probability of chl a being eutrophic or hypereutrophic was as high as 0 92 shallow lakes 0 85 transitional lakes and 0 82 deep lakes fig 3 c however when the tp trophic status was oligo mesotrophic and the tn status was hypereutrophic the probability of chl a trophic status being eutrophic or hypereutrophic was relatively low fig 3 g changing the tp trophic status from oligo mesotrophic to eutrophic or hypereutrophic led to an increase in chl a trophic status to mainly eutrophic or hypereutrophic fig 3 g 3 h and 3 i these results demonstrate that tp generally plays a more important role than tn in determining chl a trophic status both for shallow lakes and for deep lakes however tn may play an important role in some situations as displayed in fig 3 a and 3 c with the change in tn trophic status from oligo mesotrophic to hypereutrophic when the tp status is oligo mesotrophic the trophic status of chl a being hypereutrophic in shallow lakes increases more than in transitional and deep lakes similarly changing tn trophic status from oligo mesotrophic to hypereutrophic when the tp status is hypereutrophic led to an increase in chl a trophic status as hypereutrophic in all lakes these results demonstrate that tn may have a more significant interactive impact on the chl a status in shallow lakes when the tp trophic status is hypereutrophic 3 3 response of chl a to nutrients based on posterior predictive simulation of bhm having explored the potential effects of tp and tn on chl a with variable lake depth based on the bns model we used the bhm to quantify the chl a nutrient response taking advantage of the simplicity and flexibility of bhm is useful for eutrophication management malve and qian 2006 mellios et al 2020 to evaluate the model accuracy we plotted the log transformation of observed versus predicted chl a in the three lake groups as shown in fig 4 the bhm performed rather well for all lake groups the r2 rmse and ame were 0 68 0 71 and 0 53 for shallow lakes 0 66 0 65 and 0 47 for transitional lakes and 0 68 0 67 and 0 51 for deep lakes respectively the accuracy of the established bhm provided reliable results and corresponding posterior prediction table 2 lists the 50th percentile posterior distribution parameters of bhm for the three lake groups the coefficient of tn β 2 is smaller than the coefficient of tp β 1 in all lake depth groups which enforces that tp is the more influential than tn on chl a given the possible collinearity of tp and tn it is difficult to determine their effects on chl a only on the coefficients estimated the effect of tp or tn on the nutrient chl a response curve was further investigated by using one nutrient that varied within the 5th to 95th percentile range of the observed data dataset including all lake groups and another nutrient that remained constant 25th percentile threshold for oligo mesotrophic threshold for eutrophic and 95th percentile to ensure an even distribution of the data interval the varied nutrient range was divided into four 5th percentile 25th percentile 25th percentile 50th percentile 50th percentile 75th percentile 75th percentile 95th percentile and each range was discretized into 15 the results of the posterior predictive simulation of the effect of tp or tn on the nutrient chl a relationship are illustrated in fig 5 overall the predicted chl a increased with tp and tn demonstrating that both nutrients can influence chl a however increased tp produced a significantly greater increase in chl a than tn clearly indicating that tp plays a dominant role in determining the chl a concentration across all lake groups and implying that algal growth is more likely limited by tp than by tn moreover although tn influenced chl a less than tp the effect of tn on chl a increased with increasing tp fig 5 d 5 e and 5 f additionally at the same level of nutrient concentration shallow lakes exhibited the highest chl a concentration among all the lake groups these results show a similar pattern to the inference of the bns model lending robustness to our bhm and the credence of the analysis to investigate the different nutrient criteria among lake groups another posterior prediction was implemented based on variations in tn and tp in which the tn and tp plane within a special range was discretized into 60 60 grid cells and the chl a concentration of each nutrient cell was calculated for all lakes in each lake group the method for nutrient discretization was the same as in the first implementation the response curves of the 50th percentile chl a to the tp and tn of the different lake groups were plotted as contour lines fig 6 presenting a clear nutrient chl a distribution relationship for a specific lake group substantial differences in the nutrient chl a responses were observed within the lake groups and among the groups first when tp was 40 μg l the contour lines were parallel to the y axis as tp increased the contour lines became more parallel to the x axis moreover when the concentrations of tp and tn remained the same for different lake groups the concentration of chl a was the highest in the shallow lakes followed by transitional lakes and deep lakes we further checked the robustness of the bhm and the above results by randomly selecting nine observations the average number per lake from the lakes with observations greater than 300 lake 6301 354 observations and lake 6302 340 observations in the lagos dataset while the observations of other lakes remained unchanged we found that the results revealed similar patterns to the bhm trained with the full dataset as shown in the supplementary material figs s1 s3 3 4 nutrient limitation on the basis of tn tp lake tropic status and depth in our dataset we found an apparent decrease of tn tp ratio with the increase of chl a concentration the linear fitted regression in fig 7 a pearson correlation coefficient r 0 433 p 0 001 and the differences of tn tp ratio between oligo mesotrophic eutrophic and hypereutrophic lakes were statistically significant permutation test p 0 0001 meanwhile we found a decrease in the tn tp ratio with increasing zmix zmean the linear fitted regression in fig 7 c r 0 228 p 0 001 and the differences of tn tp ratio between shallow transitional and deep lakes were statistically significant permutation test p 0 0001 moreover as the increase of chl a the limiting nutrient may shift from only p limitation tn tp 22 6 the horizontal dashed lines in fig 7 a to n p co limitation 9 tn tp 22 6 or only n limitation tn tp 9 the horizontal dotted lines in fig 7 a average tn tp ratio of oligo mesotrophic eutrophic and hypereutrophic are 35 2 24 0 and 17 1 respectively a shift from only p limitation to n p co limitation or only n limitation with decreasing lake depth was also observed fig 7 c 4 discussion our analyses based on a dataset comprising 2849 lakes and 25083 observations analyzed using bayesian networks and bayesian hierarchical linear regression models showed that synergistic effects of tp and tn on chl a occurred in all three lake types studied tp played a dominant role in determining chl a while tn particularly contributed when the lake tp concentration was high and especially in shallow lakes lake depth played an important role in determining nutrient sensitivity and shallow lakes are those most likely to become eutrophicated followed by transitional lakes and then deep lakes 4 1 in lake dynamics controlling the nutrient chl a relationship several morphological features such as the proportion of the lake area where the sediment is in direct contact with the water hypolimnion depth if any hypolimnion and the proportion of littoral zones suitable for macrophyte growth vary markedly among shallow transitional and deep lakes and this can profoundly affect the nutrient processes diehl 2002 genkai kato and carpenter 2005 søndergaard et al 2017 several model exercises and enclosure experiments have shown that lake morphological characteristics especially lake depth and mixed depth play critical roles in regulating the nutrient supply from the sediment denitrification at the water sediment interface and phytoplankton growth cantin et al 2011 diehl 2002 diehl et al 2002 genkai kato and carpenter 2005 longhi and beisner 2009 and such differences may explain why we found different nutrient chl a relationship for shallow transitional and deep lakes in shallow lakes which have close sediment contact with the water column and are most frequently disturbed by wind phytoplankton growth may be particularly supported by additional p and n from the sediment søndergaard et al 2003 different proportion of littoral zones suitable for macrophyte growth may be another factor affecting variable nutrient chl a relationship between shallow and deep lakes in general through several mechanisms e g stabilizing sediments and further decreasing the rate of nutrient cycling providing refuge for zooplankton and further enhancing the top down regulation of phytoplankton by zooplankton genkai kato and carpenter 2005 jeppesen et al 2007 søndergaard et al 2017 shallow lakes with abundant macrophytes are considered more resilient to the pressure of nutrient loading and keep low phytoplankton biomass however the loss of macrophyte induced by external or internal drivers phillips et al 2016 søndergaard et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 e g enrichment of nutrients severe fluctuation of water level increase of benthivorous fish biomass can lead to shallow lakes experiencing more internal loading of p and higher phytoplankton growth compared to deep lakes in contrast to shallow lakes deep lakes have less macrophytes lower contact between sediment and the productive epilimnion layer and higher mixing depth meaning potentially less light availability diehl 2002 diehl et al 2002 dubourg et al 2015 yang et al 2023 zhao et al 2021 which all may result in lower phytoplankton growth similar to other studies phillips et al 2008 our dataset unfortunately did not contain information on presence absence of macrophytes but it is reasonable to assume based on data from numerous danish lakes søndergaard et al 2017 that a shift from a macrophyte to a phytoplankton state with increasing nutrients concentration explain why the shallow lakes showed a more sensitive response of chl a to enrichment of nutrients than the deep lakes in our dataset key processes leading to higher importance of n for phytoplankton growth in eutrophic lakes are denitrification and p release from the sediment and the feedback between high phytoplankton biomass and the two processes muller et al 2021 qin et al 2020 saunders and kalff 2001 an increase in the denitrification rate with increasing trophic status has been widely observed muller et al 2021 wu et al 2019 as trophic status increases settled phytoplankton accumulates and decays in the sediment providing labile organic matter for denitrification and favoring sediment denitrification and thus n removal especially in shallow lakes turbulence may produce oxic conditions in the water sediment interface and lead to nitrification this favors the coupled nitrification denitrification process and thus accelerates the loss of n zhu et al 2021 moreover high accumulation of organic matter in the sediment promotes p release from the sediment to the water column especially in shallow lakes søndergaard et al 2003 increasing the potential for n limitation diehl 2002 diehl et al 2002 kolzau et al 2014 qin et al 2019 2020 the role of n in nutrient rich lakes not least the shallow ones is also evident from several previous lake specific or multi lake studies for example a study conducted in four german lakes revealed that n was more limiting in summer in shallow lakes the limiting nutrient alternated between p and n during summer in a deep stratified lake kolzau et al 2014 in lake erie usa which is a well documented eutrophic deep lake phytoplankton biomass was co limited by p and n in august to october in the central basin jessica and hunter 2007 and in maumee bay located in the southwest end of lake erie and the monitoring site having a depth of 2 5 m the limiting nutrient of phytoplankton biomass shifted from p to n during the summer season chaffin et al 2014 moreover a multi lake study based on observations of 817 danish lakes revealed that in both deep and shallow lakes chl a was more strongly related to tp than to tn however tn accounted for more of the variability in chl a than tp when tp concentrations were high søndergaard et al 2017 a study of seasonal variation in limiting factors for chl a biomass of total phytoplankton biomass and cyanobacteria in 503 danish lakes revealed an overall dominance of p limitation during winter early spring and late autumn while the role of n increased in summer not least in shallow lakes jeppesen et al 2021 downing and mccauley 1992 summarized published observations from 221 lakes in 14 countries and concluded that n limitation is significantly more frequent in lakes when tp is greater than 30 μg l this finding is similar to our result showing that when tp 40 μg l the role of tn determining chl a increased because our analysis comprised a dataset covering a broad spatial scale using a robust analytical framework our findings have the potential to provide more general insight into the nutrient chl a relationship and the role of trophic status and lake depth in determining the relationship than obtained in previous studies although lake specific strategies are most effective in controlling eutrophication for many lakes no or only scarce data are available which makes it difficult to establish a proper eutrophication control strategy in such cases our developed models may be a helpful tool to obtain simple relationships we did not include water temperature as an explanatory variable but recent studies suggest that the yield chl a tp or tn might differ among climate regions partly because the changes in top down control of phytoplankton are more pronounced in lakes located in colder regions as a result of lower fish predation on zooplankton jeppesen et al 2020 2021 further studies including data from different climate zones ours are mainly from north temperate lakes are needed to elucidate whether inclusion of water temperature can reduce the uncertainties of the relationships presented tn and tp were used here as the nutrients indicators in determining the relationship between nutrients and phytoplankton due to data availability which guarantee a dataset covering a great nutrient gradient and a wide range of ecological conditions and a more general insight meanwhile tn and tp were also the most widely used nutrients indicators in determining nutrients limitation of phytoplankton and for eutrophication control jeppesen et al 2020 2021 liang et al 2020 maberly et al 2020 malve and qian 2006 mellios et al 2020 phillips et al 2008 qin et al 2020 however phytoplankton often contains an important part of tn and tp in the water making tn and tp not fully independent variables and some studies therefore suggest that dissolved inorganic nitrogen din would be a better predictor for available nitrogen of phytoplankton growth than total nitrogen partly because luxury uptake of n is negligible and din tp seems the best indicator for nutrient limitation morris and lewis 1988 ptacnik et al 2010 a dataset including different forms of nitrogen and phosphorus such as din dissolved organic nitrogen don dissolved inorganic phosphorus dip and dissolved organic phosphorus dop is needed to investigate whether inorganic nitrogen forms can predict phytoplankton growth better and reduce the uncertainties of the relationships presented we concentrated on the most critical summer period with typical high phytoplankton biomasses but future studies should also include other seasons as the results may differ from those based on summer data only jeppesen et al 2021 4 2 n vs p limitation and implication for eutrophication control as the responses of lake ecosystem to nutrients reduction include many slow long term changes to nutrients fluxes nutrients that provide long term controls on phytoplankton biomass can be termed as ultimate limiting nutrients schindler 2012 which should be deduced by long term ecosystem scale observations and or macroscale observations our results based on datasets across broad spatial scales trophic status gradient and lake depth showed that p is dominant in determining chl a and the role of n is secondary but important in eutrophic lakes especially the shallow ones although our findings cannot be generalized to all lakes it provides an important and insightful prior information for lake eutrophication management first solely p reduction is effective in migrating eutrophication especially in deep lakes but dual n and p would likely be more advantageous and should be a more effective strategy in shallow eutrophic lakes in shallow lakes the enrichment of n reduces the resilience of lake ecosystem e g by imposing high risk of loss of submerged macrophytes gonzalez sagrario et al 2005 olsen et al 2015 phillips et al 2016 which in turn increases the risk of algae blooms and this may delay the re establishment of oligotrophic or mesotrophic status second given the need for different approaches and related costs local evaluations are recommended to identify the limiting nutrient of phytoplankton growth and to specify appropriate nutrient criteria for target chl a concentration finally our results clearly show that an adaptive strategy for nutrient control should be taken which target nutrient is not fixed but should be identified according to the trophic status and type of the lake 4 3 implications of the lake specific bhm for eutrophication control as demonstrated by malve and qian 2006 and mellios et al 2020 bhm can provide information at various hierarchy levels of lakes e g all lakes included specific lake types and specific lakes depending on data available so as to minimize the uncertainty and bias associated with lake specific prediction in addition the established bhm based on multi lake observations can function as a powerful tool for eutrophication control by setting lake specific nutrient criteria that may require driver response predictions outside the observational range to illustrate this further we implemented posterior predictions for three lakes lake dianchi shallow lake lake erhai transitional lake lake 6302 a lake in the lagos dataset deep lake to demonstrate how the bhm can be used to drive lake specific nutrient criteria table 3 lists the morphometric and chemical characteristics of the selected lakes the lake specific bhm showed variable accuracy r2 rmse and ame were 0 45 0 35 and 0 27 for lake dianchi 0 31 0 38 and 0 32 for lake erhai and 0 62 0 66 and 0 47 for lake lagos 6302 although the performance of the lake specific bhm had higher bias than the lake type bhm they showed high accuracy considering the limited number of observations we simulated posterior probabilities of chl a for a range of tn and tp values the range between the 5th and 95th percentiles of all data tn and tp were discretized into 100 100 grids for these three specific lakes the surface of the simulated 50th percentile chl a relative to variable tn and tp is plotted in fig 8 these surface plots provide clear lake specific nutrient chl a response curves which can be easily understood and used for setting nutrient criteria meanwhile even if the nutrient ranges tn 203 2610 μg l tp 5 0 168 μg l used for simulation are outside the observational range for the specific lake reasonable extrapolation can help determine target tp and or tn values moreover the predicted probabilistic distribution of chl a obtained provides more information than can be obtained by the traditional regression models and are therefore better tools to make decisions within a risk assessment framework for instance if we need to balance the financial expenditure and restoration target the nutrient response of the 50th percentile chl a may be an appropriate choice if we need to minimize the risk of exceeding a given chl a concentration with no financial considerations a cautionary decision may be adopted by the decision maker and the corresponding nutrient target to the 90th percentile chl a can be used 5 conclusions a dataset spanning thousands of lakes across broad spatial scales trophic status gradient and lake depth was analyzed applying an established bayesian analytical framework the dataset was grouped according to lake depth and mixing depth to explore the effects of lake depth and trophic status on the nutrient chl a relationship the inference of bns and subsequent simulation of the bhm both showed that tp played a dominant role in determining chl a concentration in both shallow and deep lakes while tn overall played a secondary role though depending on lake type the effect of tn on chl a tends to be more important when the lake tp is 40 μg l subsequent simulations of the bhm with variable tp and tn ranges revealed variable sensitivity of the chl a response to nutrients between shallow lakes transitional lakes and deep lakes deep lakes had the lowest yield chl a per unit of nutrient following transitional lakes and shallow lakes were the highest these results demonstrated that reduction of phosphorus is the most important way to mitigate eutrophication but a dual n and p reduction may be more effective in eutrophic lake especially in shallow lakes our study showed that the lake type nutrient chl a or lake specific nutrient chl a relationship is to be preferred in eutrophication management categorization of lake according to their depth and trophic status can help lake managers specifying better targeted control objectives and effective measures to minimize the risk of eutrophication our established bhm based on cross sectional data provides a flexible and reliable risk assessment framework for driving the tp and tn targets required for meeting a target chl a concentration required for abating eutrophication at the level of lake type or for specific lakes when using these models care should be taken giving that tn and tp are not fully independent predictors of phytoplankton biomass funding this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china nos 41961019 and 42071131 and yunnan

14622,a fundamental problem in lake eutrophication management is that the nutrient chlorophyll a chl a relationship shows high variability due to diverse influences of for example lake depth lake trophic status and latitude to accommodate the variability induced by spatial heterogeneity a reliable and general insight into the nutrient chl a relationship may be achieved by applying probabilistic methods to analyze data compiled across a broad spatial scale here the roles of two critical factors determining the nutrient chl a relationship lake depth and trophic status were explored by applying bayesian networks bns and a bayesian hierarchical linear regression model bhm to a compiled global dataset from 2849 lakes and 25083 observations we categorized the lakes into three groups shallow transitional and deep according to mean and maximum depth relative to mixing depth we found that despite a stronger effect of total phosphorus tp and total nitrogen tn on chl a when combined tp played a dominant role in determining chl a regardless of lake depth however when the lake was hypereutrophic and or tp was 40 μg l tn had a greater impact on chl a especially in shallow lakes the response curve of chl a to tp and tn varied with lake depth with deep lakes having the lowest yield chl a per unit of nutrient followed by transitional lakes while shallow lakes had the highest ratio moreover we found a decrease of tn tp with increasing chl a concentrations and lake depth represented as mixing depth mean depth our established bhm may help estimating lake type and or lake specific acceptable tn and tp concentrations that comply with target chl a concentrations with higher certainty than can be obtained when bulking all lake types graphical abstract image

chlorophyll a ld lake depth bns bayesian networks bhm bayesian hierarchical linear regression model 1 introduction freshwater eutrophication is a major global problem and phytoplankton blooms in lakes have increased globally since the 1980s ho et al 2019 enrichment of nutrients including phosphorus p and nitrogen n is considered the main driver of phytoplankton growth based on the strong empirical relationship between phytoplankton biomass and chlorophyll a chl a and p p reduction with the aim of decreasing the phytoplankton biomass is often the first measure taken to control eutrophication this is a long standing paradigm in lake management carpenter 2008 filstrup et al 2014 however several studies have challenged this p control paradigm pointing out that the effect of n on lake ecosystems is underestimated a large scale meta analysis of experimental enrichment showed that n and p limitation is equivalent in almost all situations elser et al 2007 studies based on hundreds of lakes in 17 north eastern and mid west us states found that p limitation is more likely to occur under oligo mesotrophic or eutrophic chl a conditions while co limitation of p and n occurs at hypereutrophic chl a liang et al 2020 many case studies have also found successful eutrophication control by combined n and p reduction or reduction of n alone abell et al 2010 kolzau et al 2014 maberly et al 2020 as different methods and strategies are needed for n and p control and the associated costs differ it is critical to select an appropriate strategy for p n or n p control in lake eutrophication management lake morphological characteristics such as lake depth may also play a critical role in determining nutrient chl a relationship and lake eutrophication migration strategy søndergaard et al 2017 and qin et al 2020 pointed out that differences in in lake nutrient dynamics between shallow and deep lakes may play a critical role in determining the response of chl a to nutrients internal p loading for example is especially important in shallow lakes søndergaard et al 2003 there is also evidence that the role of n might be stronger in shallow lakes as the loss by denitrification is higher here due to e g better contact between water and sediment making n a potential limiting factor in summer jeppesen et al 2007 søndergaard et al 2017 moreover there is a higher risk of loss of submerged macrophytes at high n as evidenced in several experiments e g olsen et al 2015 søndergaard et al 2007 being supported also by field data jeppesen et al 2007 furthermore phillips et al 2008 revealed that shallow lakes have a higher yield of chl a per nutrient unit of p and n than deep lakes implying that lower nutrient levels are needed in shallow lakes than in deep lakes to pass a desired chl a concentration therefore setting appropriate nutrient criteria based on the response of chl a to nutrients for different lake types is a fundamental task for lake managers to achieve cost effective eutrophication control many studies have used historical observations whole lake experiments in a single lake or observations in a few selected lakes to identify the limiting factors for phytoplankton growth and to investigate the potential control strategies and responses of chl a to nutrients paerl et al 2016 qin et al 2019 schindler et al 2016 while providing useful information inferences from small scale geographical observations may be constrained to local ecological conditions liang et al 2020 and limited to individual lakes or sets of lakes phillips et al 2008 as the nutrient chl a relationship may vary temporally and geographically abell et al 2010 paerl et al 2016 canfield et al 2019 jeppesen et al 2020 more universal relationship can be deduced by using datasets of lakes covering large ecological and climate gradients janssen et al 2019 jeppesen et al 2020 some studies based on local scale datasets have been conducted using data driven predicted models such as regression equations to investigate the nutrient chl a relationship and to determine the nutrient that is limiting the phytoplankton growth abell et al 2010 elser et al 2007 huang et al 2020 liang et al 2020 phillips et al 2008 poikane et al 2019 however a comprehensive analytical framework suitable for handling the uncertainty induced by spatial heterogeneity when exploring the relationship between nutrients and chl a is lacking a model based on data covering broad conditions and a comprehensive analytical framework may provide more general and reliable insight into the nutrient chl a relationship and moreover be directly applied to different type of lakes including lakes with limited data or low frequency sampling to elucidate the complex processes associated with the nutrient chl a relationship as well as to accommodate the variability of nutrient chl a induced by spatial heterogeneity we used a probabilistic machine learning analytical framework bayesian networks bns pearl 1985 and a bayesian hierarchical linear regression model bhm malakoff 1999 an approach widely used in ecosystems modelling e g cha et al 2016 feki sahnoun et al 2017 malve and qian 2006 mellios et al 2020 liang et al 2020 the bayesian hierarchical linear regression model bhm estimate parameters by integrating information from multiple sources and handle uncertainty in a probabilistic manner chen and pollino 2012 malve and qian 2006 mellios et al 2020 moreover methods based on bayes theorem provide a mutually verified analytical framework that ensures reliable results thus the objectives of this study were to 1 elucidate the role of n p or both are the potential most important growth limiting factor for phytoplankton chl a in lakes across broad spatial scales and trophic status gradients 2 examine whether the potential limiting nutrient varies with lake depth 3 test bhm to estimate how changes in nutrient concentrations may alter the probability of chl a concentrations to provide detailed information for lake eutrophication management decisions and nutrient criteria and 4 examine to what extent the response curve of chl a to nutrient concentrations varies with lake depth the analysis is based on a dataset comprising 2849 lakes globally 2 materials and methods 2 1 dataset we integrated several regional lake monitoring datasets including the geospatial and temporal database of us lakes lagos soranno et al 2017 european lake monitoring data collected by the european environment agency member countries waterbase lakes https www eea europa eu data and maps data waterbase lakes 10 the china lake scientific database http www lakesci csdb cn and water quality data from yunnan plateau lakes monitored by the environmental monitoring station of yunnan province we conducted a quality control of the compiled data as follows first we removed extreme values defined as chl a 400 μg l and 1 μg l we then selected data collected from june to september the growing season to minimize the influence of temperature discrepancy caused by diverse latitudes and altitudes moreover to investigate potential differences in the nutrient chl a relationship related to lake morphometry recordings of surface area and maximum and mean depth of a number of lakes without documented data on these parameters were drawn from the hydrolakes database messager et al 2016 according to their geographical location a total of 25083 observations of tn tp and chl a from 2849 lakes table 1 fig 1 were used in the analysis of these 2849 lakes 1324 had only one observation while for the remaining lakes the observations ranged from 2 to 354 the average number per lake being 8 8 there are 21 lakes that have more than 100 observations in our database 2088 lakes were from the us 705 from europe and 56 from china 2 2 categorization of lakes the categorization of lakes for lake specific models is often based on the assumption that lakes belonging to a particular type exhibit a similar response of chl a to the stressor tp and or tn malve and qian 2006 canfield et al 2019 mellios et al 2020 for example due to limited information on geographical and natural characteristics of their study lakes malve and qian 2006 classified 2289 finnish lakes into nine groups based on mean depth and humic type and qin et al 2020 classified their study lakes into three groups based on lake depth however for more global datasets detailed information of lake characteristics are lacking it is critical to apply effective tools to quantify the chl a nutrient response to the most influential factors while taking into account the data limitation that often exists when exploring these nutrient chl a relationships at macroscale as numerous local studies have shown that lake depth plays an important role in the chl a nutrient response malve and qian 2006 mellios et al 2020 søndergaard et al 2017 qin et al 2020 we divided our lakes according to depth following qin et al 2020 into three groups shallow transitional and deep based on lake mixing depth zmix mean depth zmean and maximum depth zmax i e shallow lakes are those with mixing depths exceeding the maximum depth transitional lakes are those with a mean depth mixing depth maximum depth and the deep lakes are those with mixing depths lower than the mean depth the mixing depth was estimated using lake area zmix 100 185log a 0 842 2 37 1 05 where a is the area of the lake surface km2 hanna 1990 2 3 bayesian networks being a widely used and powerful probabilistic graphical modeling technique the bayesian networks bns method pearl 1985 allows investigation of the implicit relationship between variables in a probabilistic manner even when the relationship involves uncertainty the method is particularly useful when data are integrated across varied ecological conditions therefore a bns model was established to investigate whether the nutrient limitation of chl a varied with lake type a bns model uses nodes variables of interest including parent nodes and child nodes and edges the connections among nodes to represent dependency relationships among nodes we developed a simple bns model with tn tp and lake depth as drivers parent nodes and chl a as the response variable child node although continuous variables can be dealt with to some extent in bns uusitalo 2007 the usual solution is to discretize the variables to avoid overly complicated algorithms and time consuming computation aguilera et al 2012 feki sahnoun et al 2017 liang et al 2020 uusitalo 2007 we adapted a lake eutrophication management oriented method for discretization of tn tp and chl a which defined tn tp and chl a as oligo mesotrophic tp 25 μg l tn 750 μg l chl a 7 μg l eutrophic 25 tp 50 μg l 750 tn 1400 μg l 7 chl a 30 μg l and hypereutrophic tp 50 μg l tn 1400 μg l chl a 30 μg l usepa 2009 the discretization of the lake depth was the same as that of lake classification the discretization data on tn tp chl a and lake depth tn tp and chl a are expressed as trophic status and lake depth as water depth type were used as input and output for the bns model thus the established bns model has three network parent nodes tn tp and lake depth with three states of each parent node and one network child node chl a with three states we used the r package of bnlearn to estimate the parameters and evaluate model performance scutari 2010 a 10 fold cross validation strategy in which the model was fitted 10 times to 90 observations while the remaining 10 was retained for out of sample prediction was adapted to assess the established model classification accuracy the classification accuracy was 68 8 which is satisfactory and ensures the reliability of established bns model the calibrated bns model can provide the possibility of chl a trophic status under certain trophic status of tn and tp and certain lake depth type for example we can get the probability of chl a being eutrophic when setting tn to be eutrophic tp to be hypereutrophic and lake depth to be shallow 2 4 bayesian hierarchical linear regression model the bayesian hierarchical linear regression model bhm has proven effective and suitable in studies modeling the nutrient chl a relationship malve and qian 2006 a hierarchical model can obtain enough parameters from information pooling based on different levels to form a realistic and hierarchical model without overfitting the data gelman et al 2013 here we used an established bhm based on a dataset covering different lake depths and trophic states to pool information within and among lake types the bhm used induced a lake specific curve of the nutrient chl a response 1 log chl a i j k n o r m a l β 0 i j β 1 i j log t

of determination r squared r2 absolute mean error ame and root mean square error rmse were used to assess the accuracy and precision of the model fit 3 results 3 1 the role of tp and tn in differential depth lakes the statistics and boxplots of tn tp and chl a for the different groups of lakes are shown in table 1 and fig 2 we observed an increase in the growing season concentrations of tn tp and chl a with decreasing lake depth and the difference between shallow transitional and deep lakes were statistically significant permutation test p 0 0001 even when a lake had the same trophic status the concentrations of tn tp and chl a in the shallow lakes were highest among the three lake groups although a higher mean chl a concentration was related to higher mean tn and tp concentrations in all groups lake depth seems to play an important role for the algal biomass we explored the role of lake depth for the nutrient chl a relationship using the results of established bns model for the probabilities of chl a trophic status under different combinations of tn and tp trophic states fig 3 we found that 27 0 of the shallow lakes were classified as eutrophic or hypereutrophic when the nutrient state was oligo mesotrophic while 25 1 of the transitional lakes and 17 9 of the deep lakes were in belonged to these categories fig 3 a moreover when the trophic status of tn and tp changes from oligo mesotrophic to eutrophic or hypereutrophic the probability of chl a trophic status being eutrophic or hypereutrophic increased sharply in all lake groups among the three groups 82 6 of the shallow lakes 84 4 of the transitional lakes and 80 7 of the deep lakes were now eutrophic or hypereutrophic state when the nutrients reached the eutrophic state while 95 0 of the shallow lakes 88 7 of the transitional lakes and 86 2 of the deep lakes were eutrophic or hypereutrophic when the nutrients reached a hypereutrophic state fig 3 a 3 e and 3 i these results showed that the increase in tn and tp concentrations in lakes induces an increase in the chl a concentration at macroscale being most pronounced in shallow lakes 3 2 the role of tp and tn in differential trophic status lakes comparing chl a trophic status with one nutrient fixed and one variable allowed us to explore the relative effect of nutrients on chl a as shown in fig 3 a 3 b and 3 c an oligo mesotrophic tn trophic state that changes the tp state from oligo mesotrophic to eutrophic or hypereutrophic resulted in a decrease in the probability of chl a being oligo mesotrophic for all lakes probability of a decline 0 65 0 60 and 0 64 for shallow transitional and deep lakes respectively when tp is eutrophic and an increase in the probability of chl a tropic status being eutrophic and hypereutrophic in contrast when the constant tp trophic state was oligo mesotrophic and the tn state changed from oligo mesotrophic to eutrophic or hypereutrophic there was a relatively small decrease in the probability of chl a trophic status being oligo mesotrophic for instance a shift in tn from oligo mesotrophic to hypereutrophic led to a 26 3 0 73 0 47 shift of shallow lakes from an oligo mesotrophic to a eutrophic or hypereutrophic state which is smaller than the transfers resulting from a shift in tp 64 6 0 73 0 08 these results show that while both tn and tp influence chl a tp seems to overall play a more important role consistent with the above mentioned results when tp and tn trophic statuses are hypereutrophic and oligo mesotrophic respectively the probability of chl a being eutrophic or hypereutrophic was as high as 0 92 shallow lakes 0 85 transitional lakes and 0 82 deep lakes fig 3 c however when the tp trophic status was oligo mesotrophic and the tn status was hypereutrophic the probability of chl a trophic status being eutrophic or hypereutrophic was relatively low fig 3 g changing the tp trophic status from oligo mesotrophic to eutrophic or hypereutrophic led to an increase in chl a trophic status to mainly eutrophic or hypereutrophic fig 3 g 3 h and 3 i these results demonstrate that tp generally plays a more important role than tn in determining chl a trophic status both for shallow lakes and for deep lakes however tn may play an important role in some situations as displayed in fig 3 a and 3 c with the change in tn trophic status from oligo mesotrophic to hypereutrophic when the tp status is oligo mesotrophic the trophic status of chl a being hypereutrophic in shallow lakes increases more than in transitional and deep lakes similarly changing tn trophic status from oligo mesotrophic to hypereutrophic when the tp status is hypereutrophic led to an increase in chl a trophic status as hypereutrophic in all lakes these results demonstrate that tn may have a more significant interactive impact on the chl a status in shallow lakes when the tp trophic status is hypereutrophic 3 3 response of chl a to nutrients based on posterior predictive simulation of bhm having explored the potential effects of tp and tn on chl a with variable lake depth based on the bns model we used the bhm to quantify the chl a nutrient response taking advantage of the simplicity and flexibility of bhm is useful for eutrophication management malve and qian 2006 mellios et al 2020 to evaluate the model accuracy we plotted the log transformation of observed versus predicted chl a in the three lake groups as shown in fig 4 the bhm performed rather well for all lake groups the r2 rmse and ame were 0 68 0 71 and 0 53 for shallow lakes 0 66 0 65 and 0 47 for transitional lakes and 0 68 0 67 and 0 51 for deep lakes respectively the accuracy of the established bhm provided reliable results and corresponding posterior prediction table 2 lists the 50th percentile posterior distribution parameters of bhm for the three lake groups the coefficient of tn β 2 is smaller than the coefficient of tp β 1 in all lake depth groups which enforces that tp is the more influential than tn on chl a given the possible collinearity of tp and tn it is difficult to determine their effects on chl a only on the coefficients estimated the effect of tp or tn on the nutrient chl a response curve was further investigated by using one nutrient that varied within the 5th to 95th percentile range of the observed data dataset including all lake groups and another nutrient that remained constant 25th percentile threshold for oligo mesotrophic threshold for eutrophic and 95th percentile to ensure an even distribution of the data interval the varied nutrient range was divided into four 5th percentile 25th percentile 25th percentile 50th percentile 50th percentile 75th percentile 75th percentile 95th percentile and each range was discretized into 15 the results of the posterior predictive simulation of the effect of tp or tn on the nutrient chl a relationship are illustrated in fig 5 overall the predicted chl a increased with tp and tn demonstrating that both nutrients can influence chl a however increased tp produced a significantly greater increase in chl a than tn clearly indicating that tp plays a dominant role in determining the chl a concentration across all lake groups and implying that algal growth is more likely limited by tp than by tn moreover although tn influenced chl a less than tp the effect of tn on chl a increased with increasing tp fig 5 d 5 e and 5 f additionally at the same level of nutrient concentration shallow lakes exhibited the highest chl a concentration among all the lake groups these results show a similar pattern to the inference of the bns model lending robustness to our bhm and the credence of the analysis to investigate the different nutrient criteria among lake groups another posterior prediction was implemented based on variations in tn and tp in which the tn and tp plane within a special range was discretized into 60 60 grid cells and the chl a concentration of each nutrient cell was calculated for all lakes in each lake group the method for nutrient discretization was the same as in the first implementation the response curves of the 50th percentile chl a to the tp and tn of the different lake groups were plotted as contour lines fig 6 presenting a clear nutrient chl a distribution relationship for a specific lake group substantial differences in the nutrient chl a responses were observed within the lake groups and among the groups first when tp was 40 μg l the contour lines were parallel to the y axis as tp increased the contour lines became more parallel to the x axis moreover when the concentrations of tp and tn remained the same for different lake groups the concentration of chl a was the highest in the shallow lakes followed by transitional lakes and deep lakes we further checked the robustness of the bhm and the above results by randomly selecting nine observations the average number per lake from the lakes with observations greater than 300 lake 6301 354 observations and lake 6302 340 observations in the lagos dataset while the observations of other lakes remained unchanged we found that the results revealed similar patterns to the bhm trained with the full dataset as shown in the supplementary material figs s1 s3 3 4 nutrient limitation on the basis of tn tp lake tropic status and depth in our dataset we found an apparent decrease of tn tp ratio with the increase of chl a concentration the linear fitted regression in fig 7 a pearson correlation coefficient r 0 433 p 0 001 and the differences of tn tp ratio between oligo mesotrophic eutrophic and hypereutrophic lakes were statistically significant permutation test p 0 0001 meanwhile we found a decrease in the tn tp ratio with increasing zmix zmean the linear fitted regression in fig 7 c r 0 228 p 0 001 and the differences of tn tp ratio between shallow transitional and deep lakes were statistically significant permutation test p 0 0001 moreover as the increase of chl a the limiting nutrient may shift from only p limitation tn tp 22 6 the horizontal dashed lines in fig 7 a to n p co limitation 9 tn tp 22 6 or only n limitation tn tp 9 the horizontal dotted lines in fig 7 a average tn tp ratio of oligo mesotrophic eutrophic and hypereutrophic are 35 2 24 0 and 17 1 respectively a shift from only p limitation to n p co limitation or only n limitation with decreasing lake depth was also observed fig 7 c 4 discussion our analyses based on a dataset comprising 2849 lakes and 25083 observations analyzed using bayesian networks and bayesian hierarchical linear regression models showed that synergistic effects of tp and tn on chl a occurred in all three lake types studied tp played a dominant role in determining chl a while tn particularly contributed when the lake tp concentration was high and especially in shallow lakes lake depth played an important role in determining nutrient sensitivity and shallow lakes are those most likely to become eutrophicated followed by transitional lakes and then deep lakes 4 1 in lake dynamics controlling the nutrient chl a relationship several morphological features such as the proportion of the lake area where the sediment is in direct contact with the water hypolimnion depth if any hypolimnion and the proportion of littoral zones suitable for macrophyte growth vary markedly among shallow transitional and deep lakes and this can profoundly affect the nutrient processes diehl 2002 genkai kato and carpenter 2005 søndergaard et al 2017 several model exercises and enclosure experiments have shown that lake morphological characteristics especially lake depth and mixed depth play critical roles in regulating the nutrient supply from the sediment denitrification at the water sediment interface and phytoplankton growth cantin et al 2011 diehl 2002 diehl et al 2002 genkai kato and carpenter 2005 longhi and beisner 2009 and such differences may explain why we found different nutrient chl a relationship for shallow transitional and deep lakes in shallow lakes which have close sediment contact with the water column and are most frequently disturbed by wind phytoplankton growth may be particularly supported by additional p and n from the sediment søndergaard et al 2003 different proportion of littoral zones suitable for macrophyte growth may be another factor affecting variable nutrient chl a relationship between shallow and deep lakes in general through several mechanisms e g stabilizing sediments and further decreasing the rate of nutrient cycling providing refuge for zooplankton and further enhancing the top down regulation of phytoplankton by zooplankton genkai kato and carpenter 2005 jeppesen et al 2007 søndergaard et al 2017 shallow lakes with abundant macrophytes are considered more resilient to the pressure of nutrient loading and keep low phytoplankton biomass however the loss of macrophyte induced by external or internal drivers phillips et al 2016 søndergaard et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 e g enrichment of nutrients severe fluctuation of water level increase of benthivorous fish biomass can lead to shallow lakes experiencing more internal loading of p and higher phytoplankton growth compared to deep lakes in contrast to shallow lakes deep lakes have less macrophytes lower contact between sediment and the productive epilimnion layer and higher mixing depth meaning potentially less light availability diehl 2002 diehl et al 2002 dubourg et al 2015 yang et al 2023 zhao et al 2021 which all may result in lower phytoplankton growth similar to other studies phillips et al 2008 our dataset unfortunately did not contain information on presence absence of macrophytes but it is reasonable to assume based on data from numerous danish lakes søndergaard et al 2017 that a shift from a macrophyte to a phytoplankton state with increasing nutrients concentration explain why the shallow lakes showed a more sensitive response of chl a to enrichment of nutrients than the deep lakes in our dataset key processes leading to higher importance of n for phytoplankton growth in eutrophic lakes are denitrification and p release from the sediment and the feedback between high phytoplankton biomass and the two processes muller et al 2021 qin et al 2020 saunders and kalff 2001 an increase in the denitrification rate with increasing trophic status has been widely observed muller et al 2021 wu et al 2019 as trophic status increases settled phytoplankton accumulates and decays in the sediment providing labile organic matter for denitrification and favoring sediment denitrification and thus n removal especially in shallow lakes turbulence may produce oxic conditions in the water sediment interface and lead to nitrification this favors the coupled nitrification denitrification process and thus accelerates the loss of n zhu et al 2021 moreover high accumulation of organic matter in the sediment promotes p release from the sediment to the water column especially in shallow lakes søndergaard et al 2003 increasing the potential for n limitation diehl 2002 diehl et al 2002 kolzau et al 2014 qin et al 2019 2020 the role of n in nutrient rich lakes not least the shallow ones is also evident from several previous lake specific or multi lake studies for example a study conducted in four german lakes revealed that n was more limiting in summer in shallow lakes the limiting nutrient alternated between p and n during summer in a deep stratified lake kolzau et al 2014 in lake erie usa which is a well documented eutrophic deep lake phytoplankton biomass was co limited by p and n in august to october in the central basin jessica and hunter 2007 and in maumee bay located in the southwest end of lake erie and the monitoring site having a depth of 2 5 m the limiting nutrient of phytoplankton biomass shifted from p to n during the summer season chaffin et al 2014 moreover a multi lake study based on observations of 817 danish lakes revealed that in both deep and shallow lakes chl a was more strongly related to tp than to tn however tn accounted for more of the variability in chl a than tp when tp concentrations were high søndergaard et al 2017 a study of seasonal variation in limiting factors for chl a biomass of total phytoplankton biomass and cyanobacteria in 503 danish lakes revealed an overall dominance of p limitation during winter early spring and late autumn while the role of n increased in summer not least in shallow lakes jeppesen et al 2021 downing and mccauley 1992 summarized published observations from 221 lakes in 14 countries and concluded that n limitation is significantly more frequent in lakes when tp is greater than 30 μg l this finding is similar to our result showing that when tp 40 μg l the role of tn determining chl a increased because our analysis comprised a dataset covering a broad spatial scale using a robust analytical framework our findings have the potential to provide more general insight into the nutrient chl a relationship and the role of trophic status and lake depth in determining the relationship than obtained in previous studies although lake specific strategies are most effective in controlling eutrophication for many lakes no or only scarce data are available which makes it difficult to establish a proper eutrophication control strategy in such cases our developed models may be a helpful tool to obtain simple relationships we did not include water temperature as an explanatory variable but recent studies suggest that the yield chl a tp or tn might differ among climate regions partly because the changes in top down control of phytoplankton are more pronounced in lakes located in colder regions as a result of lower fish predation on zooplankton jeppesen et al 2020 2021 further studies including data from different climate zones ours are mainly from north temperate lakes are needed to elucidate whether inclusion of water temperature can reduce the uncertainties of the relationships presented tn and tp were used here as the nutrients indicators in determining the relationship between nutrients and phytoplankton due to data availability which guarantee a dataset covering a great nutrient gradient and a wide range of ecological conditions and a more general insight meanwhile tn and tp were also the most widely used nutrients indicators in determining nutrients limitation of phytoplankton and for eutrophication control jeppesen et al 2020 2021 liang et al 2020 maberly et al 2020 malve and qian 2006 mellios et al 2020 phillips et al 2008 qin et al 2020 however phytoplankton often contains an important part of tn and tp in the water making tn and tp not fully independent variables and some studies therefore suggest that dissolved inorganic nitrogen din would be a better predictor for available nitrogen of phytoplankton growth than total nitrogen partly because luxury uptake of n is negligible and din tp seems the best indicator for nutrient limitation morris and lewis 1988 ptacnik et al 2010 a dataset including different forms of nitrogen and phosphorus such as din dissolved organic nitrogen don dissolved inorganic phosphorus dip and dissolved organic phosphorus dop is needed to investigate whether inorganic nitrogen forms can predict phytoplankton growth better and reduce the uncertainties of the relationships presented we concentrated on the most critical summer period with typical high phytoplankton biomasses but future studies should also include other seasons as the results may differ from those based on summer data only jeppesen et al 2021 4 2 n vs p limitation and implication for eutrophication control as the responses of lake ecosystem to nutrients reduction include many slow long term changes to nutrients fluxes nutrients that provide long term controls on phytoplankton biomass can be termed as ultimate limiting nutrients schindler 2012 which should be deduced by long term ecosystem scale observations and or macroscale observations our results based on datasets across broad spatial scales trophic status gradient and lake depth showed that p is dominant in determining chl a and the role of n is secondary but important in eutrophic lakes especially the shallow ones although our findings cannot be generalized to all lakes it provides an important and insightful prior information for lake eutrophication management first solely p reduction is effective in migrating eutrophication especially in deep lakes but dual n and p would likely be more advantageous and should be a more effective strategy in shallow eutrophic lakes in shallow lakes the enrichment of n reduces the resilience of lake ecosystem e g by imposing high risk of loss of submerged macrophytes gonzalez sagrario et al 2005 olsen et al 2015 phillips et al 2016 which in turn increases the risk of algae blooms and this may delay the re establishment of oligotrophic or mesotrophic status second given the need for different approaches and related costs local evaluations are recommended to identify the limiting nutrient of phytoplankton growth and to specify appropriate nutrient criteria for target chl a concentration finally our results clearly show that an adaptive strategy for nutrient control should be taken which target nutrient is not fixed but should be identified according to the trophic status and type of the lake 4 3 implications of the lake specific bhm for eutrophication control as demonstrated by malve and qian 2006 and mellios et al 2020 bhm can provide information at various hierarchy levels of lakes e g all lakes included specific lake types and specific lakes depending on data available so as to minimize the uncertainty and bias associated with lake specific prediction in addition the established bhm based on multi lake observations can function as a powerful tool for eutrophication control by setting lake specific nutrient criteria that may require driver response predictions outside the observational range to illustrate this further we implemented posterior predictions for three lakes lake dianchi shallow lake lake erhai transitional lake lake 6302 a lake in the lagos dataset deep lake to demonstrate how the bhm can be used to drive lake specific nutrient criteria table 3 lists the morphometric and chemical characteristics of the selected lakes the lake specific bhm showed variable accuracy r2 rmse and ame were 0 45 0 35 and 0 27 for lake dianchi 0 31 0 38 and 0 32 for lake erhai and 0 62 0 66 and 0 47 for lake lagos 6302 although the performance of the lake specific bhm had higher bias than the lake type bhm they showed high accuracy considering the limited number of observations we simulated posterior probabilities of chl a for a range of tn and tp values the range between the 5th and 95th percentiles of all data tn and tp were discretized into 100 100 grids for these three specific lakes the surface of the simulated 50th percentile chl a relative to variable tn and tp is plotted in fig 8 these surface plots provide clear lake specific nutrient chl a response curves which can be easily understood and used for setting nutrient criteria meanwhile even if the nutrient ranges tn 203 2610 μg l tp 5 0 168 μg l used for simulation are outside the observational range for the specific lake reasonable extrapolation can help determine target tp and or tn values moreover the predicted probabilistic distribution of chl a obtained provides more information than can be obtained by the traditional regression models and are therefore better tools to make decisions within a risk assessment framework for instance if we need to balance the financial expenditure and restoration target the nutrient response of the 50th percentile chl a may be an appropriate choice if we need to minimize the risk of exceeding a given chl a concentration with no financial considerations a cautionary decision may be adopted by the decision maker and the corresponding nutrient target to the 90th percentile chl a can be used 5 conclusions a dataset spanning thousands of lakes across broad spatial scales trophic status gradient and lake depth was analyzed applying an established bayesian analytical framework the dataset was grouped according to lake depth and mixing depth to explore the effects of lake depth and trophic status on the nutrient chl a relationship the inference of bns and subsequent simulation of the bhm both showed that tp played a dominant role in determining chl a concentration in both shallow and deep lakes while tn overall played a secondary role though depending on lake type the effect of tn on chl a tends to be more important when the lake tp is 40 μg l subsequent simulations of the bhm with variable tp and tn ranges revealed variable sensitivity of the chl a response to nutrients between shallow lakes transitional lakes and deep lakes deep lakes had the lowest yield chl a per unit of nutrient following transitional lakes and shallow lakes were the highest these results demonstrated that reduction of phosphorus is the most important way to mitigate eutrophication but a dual n and p reduction may be more effective in eutrophic lake especially in shallow lakes our study showed that the lake type nutrient chl a or lake specific nutrient chl a relationship is to be preferred in eutrophication management categorization of lake according to their depth and trophic status can help lake managers specifying better targeted control objectives and effective measures to minimize the risk of eutrophication our established bhm based on cross sectional data provides a flexible and reliable risk assessment framework for driving the tp and tn targets required for meeting a target chl a concentration required for abating eutrophication at the level of lake type or for specific lakes when using these models care should be taken giving that tn and tp are not fully independent predictors of phytoplankton biomass funding this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china nos 41961019 and 42071131 and yunnan

14623,indirect potable reuse of wastewater is a practice that is gaining attention aiming to increase freshwater supplies to meet water scarcity however reusing effluent wastewater for drinking water production comes with a paired risk of adverse health effects due to the potential presence of pathogenic microorganisms and hazardous micropollutants disinfection is an established method to reduce microbial hazards in drinking water but it has been associated with formation of disinfection by products dbps in this study we performed an effect based assessment of chemical hazards in a system wherein a full scale trial of disinfection by chlorination of the treated wastewater was performed prior discharge to the reciepient river the presence of bioactive pollutants was assessed along the entire treatment system starting from incoming wastewater to finished drinking water at seven sites in and around the llobregat river in barcelona spain samples were collected in two campaigns with and without applied chlorination treatment 13 mg cl2 l to the effluent wastewater the water samples were analysed for cell viability oxidative stress response nrf2 activity estrogenicity androgenicity aryl hydrocarbon receptor ahr activity and activation of nfĸb nuclear factor kappa light chain enhancer of activated b cells signaling using stably transfected mammalian cell lines nrf2 activity estrogen receptor activation and ahr activation was detected in all investigated samples overall removal efficiencies were high in both wastewater treatment and drinking water treatment samples for most of the studied endpoints no increase in oxidative stress nrf2 activity could be attributed to the additional chlorination treatment of the effluent wastewater however we found an increase in ahr activity and a reduction of er agonistic activity after chlorination treatment of effluent wastewater the bioactivity detected in finished drinking water was considerably lower compared to what was found in effluent wastewater we could thus conclude that indirect reuse of treated wastewater for drinking water production can be possible without compromising drinking water quality this study

ahr activation androgen receptor ar activity and immune response by nuclear factor kappa beta nfκβ activation 2 materials and methods 2 1 water sampling grab water samples were collected at seven sample sites s1 s7 fig 1 and table 1 under the coordination of the aca in june and july of 2019 sampling sites were located in the lower part of the llobregat river basin between the inlet of the dwt plant of sant joan despí and a point 8 5 km upstream based on the hydraulic retention and residence time between the different sampling sites the samples were collected in scheduled timely accordance aiming to collect the same bulk of water parcel along the distribution system the difference between the two sampling campaigns c1 and c2 was that chlorination of reclaimed wastewater effluent was applied between sites s3 and s4 in the second campaign at a dose of 13 mg cl2 l sodium hypochlorite naocl fig 1 this dose of chlorine was set according to pump capacity limitations and was below breakpoint chlorination which was experimentally measured at 30 mg cl2 l the applied wwt methods at el prat de llobregat treatment facility include nitrification denitrification secondary treatment membrane filtration and uv treatment tertiary treatment at sant joan despí dwt facility treatment methods include two parallel treatment lines one treatment line consist of ozonation and gac filtration and the other line consist of ultrafiltration followed by reversed osmosis the two treatment lines are blended prior to final disinfection with chlorine water sample characteristics such as

analysed for seven toxicity endpoints of relevance for both human and ecological hazard identification table 2 all samples were tested in cell viability assessments to ensure that bioactivities were studied under non cytotoxic conditions a detailed description of the applied bioassays is given in si the seven endpoints were assessed along with solvent control reference compound and procedural blanks in stably transfected luciferase reporter gene assays in 384 well plate corning usa format a tecan infinite m1000 reader was used to measure luminescence after addition of luciferin the concentrations of samples studied in the bioassays are expressed as relative enrichment factors ref the highest ref tested was calculated as enrichment factor at spe x 0 01 100 fold dilution with cell medium at bioassay a ref 1 implies that the water sample has been enriched as compared to the grab water sample and a ref 1 that the sample has been diluted all bioassays were conducted with a constant solvent concentration 1 1 4 meoh etoh v v description of data evaluation and calculations of ec and beq values can be found in si 3 results and discussion 3 1 cell viability samples were tested for cytotoxicity in ar ecoscreen vm7luc4e2 mcf7arec32 hepg2 nfκβ and dr ecoscreen cell lines cytotoxicity was defined as cell viability of 80 compared to the solvent control the highest tested ref values were 20 for wastewater 50 for surface water and 100 for drinking water i e wastewater was tested at 20x enrichment surface water at of 50x enrichment and drinking water at 100x enrichment as compared to grab water samples table 1 most samples did not show cytotoxicity at the highest tested ref in any of the cell lines figs s 1 5 in si except for influent wastewater which for most cell lines had to be diluted to ref 2 5 to reach non cytotoxic conditions the following samples were cytotoxic at the highest concentrations and thus excluded from regression analyses sample c2s4 c2s5 and c2s6 were cytotoxic at ref 50 in dr ecoscreen figs s1 si sample c2s4 was cytotoxic at ref 50 in vm7luc4er figs s2 si and sample c2s3 was cytotoxic at ref 10 in ar ecoscreen figs s4 si additionally sample concentrations that showed signs of potential masked cytotoxicity i e displayed a negative trend of bioactivity with increasing ref were also excluded from regression analyses 3 2 procedural blanks in three of the endpoints in this study the procedural blanks milliq water concentrated over spe showed some bioactivity table 3 in the nrf2 assessment the two blanks from c1 and c2 showed activity at ref 20 the bioactivity was just above the cut off value in the two campaigns at the next tested concentration ref 10 no activity was detected one of the objectives here was to investigate the effect of chlorination treatment between the campaigns using nrf2 activity as an indicator of dbp formation since the background activity was borderline above cut off and comparably equal between the two blanks in nrf2 activity assessment we argue that this comparison could still be made successfully the two other endpoints were blanks showed bioactivity was ahr activation at ref 20 and er agonist activity at ref 20 through ref 5 table 3 samples s5 s7 were analysed at higher refs in all assays as compared to the other samples the samples analysed at the highest tested ref values were finished drinking water s7 however for er agonist activity for example the drinking water from both campaigns exhibited lower bioactivity at ref 20 than what the procedural blank did at ref 20 at around 2 and 6 of assay maximum hence the potential contamination of samples observed in the procedural blank did not seem to be as pronounced in the real samples we hypothesize that this might be due to the low ionic strength of the deionized water used to prepare the procedural blank which could make this blank sample extra susceptible to contamination from the spe process actual samples with a higher ionic strength did not seem to be as susceptible to contamination from the spe process we cannot rule out the possibility of overestimation of the endpoints tested at concentrations higher than the active blanks however to claim the contrary our er agonist and ahr data are comparably low in relation to literature data see sections 3 4 2 and 3 5 2 we argue that the intra sample comparison in this study can still confidently be made but some caution is advisable when comparing our data with other studies 3 3 oxidative stress response nrf2 activity oxidative stress response measured as nrf2 activity was observed in all analysed samples concentration response relationships are presented in fig 2 ecir1 5 and beq values are presented in table 4 and removal efficiencies in table 5 and table 6 the highest detected nrf2 activity was found in influent wastewater samples s1 at 2900 and 1500 μg tbhqeq l in c1 and c2 respectively after secondary treatment nitrification denitrification s2 the nrf2 activity was reduced compared to s1 with a removal efficiency of 93 in both campaigns in tertiary treated wastewater filtration uv treatment s3 the nrf2 activity was higher in c1 compared to c2 and there was an increase in activity in both campaigns compared to s2 at the end of the pipeline s4 there was an increase in nrf2 activity in both campaigns as compared to s3 with a negative removal efficiency of 66 in c1 and 33 in c2 the increase was hence larger in c1 as compared to c2 with chlorination treatment thus chlorination treatment could not be concluded to have a major impact on the nrf2 activity since there was an increase in activity both with and without chlorination treatment rather the increase between sample sites s3 and s4 indicates some contaminating factor within the pipeline contributing to an increase in nrf2 activity in the upstream river sample s5 the nrf2 activity was higher in c1 compared to c2 at 170 µg tbhqeq l in c1 and 20 µg tbhqeq l in c2 at the raw water intake to the dwt plant s6 the nrf2 activity increased compared to the upstream samples and was continuously higher in c1 at 1500 µg tbhqeq l as compared to 40 µg tbhqeq l for c2 thus the overall potency for oxidative stress in the river was higher in c1 as compared to c2 the reason for this difference in oxidative stress in surface water samples between the studied campaigns cannot easily be elucidated possible influencing factors during times of sampling include variations in river flow contaminant concentration and precipitation hence further research would be needed to explain these variations in oxidative stress in surface water despite the difference in nrf2 activity at drinking water intake s6 the nrf2 activity was equal and low in both campaigns after drinking water treatment s7 at 33 µg tbhqeq l in summary the oxidative stress response of the samples downstream of chlorination treatment in c2 was not higher compared to the unchlorinated equivalent samples in c1 s4 s6 s7 the applied dose of naocl in the chlorination treatment of effluent wastewater was 13 mg cl2 l breakpoint chlorination after which a residual amount of chlorine exists to elicit disinfection was experimentally measured at 30 mg cl2 l thus the applied dose was below breakpoint reaching breakpoint chlorination when disinfecting drinking water is vital to secure adequate disinfection in dwt chlorination treatment is typically applied at the end of the treatment process where the oxidant demand of the water is low normally at a dose of 0 5 2 mg cl2 l hence a much lower dose of chlorine would be needed to reach breakpoint compared to wastewater effluent with a high oxidant demand previous studies on chlorination of wastewater found an increase of certain dbps when dosing cl2 above breakpoint yang et al 2005 matamoros et al 2007 and it could be speculated that our results would have been different if breakpoint conditions had been reached a concurrent study of the same full scale water reclamation trial in the llobregat river assessing alternations on dom fingerprinting after chlorination treatment did reveal formation of halogenated species downstream chlorination treatment at doses ranging from 10 to 14 mg cl2 l sanchis et al 2021 3 4 comparison of nrf2 activity with other studies for incoming wastewater we previously reported nrf2 activities of 200 580 µg tbhqeq l from swedish wwt plants lundqvist et al 2019 and escher et al escher et al 2012 reported a range of 95 650 µg tbhqeq l from australian wwt plants which are both lower than in the present study at 2900 and 1500 µg tbhqeq l in effluent wastewater we found activities of 320 and 130 µg tbhqeq l which was higher compared to the australian data of 50 µg tbhqeq l escher et al 2012 we previously reported on tbhqeq in swedish wastewater effluent to be below lod in several cases and at 180 µg l in another case oskarsson et al 2021 lundqvist et al 2019 in surface water affected by discharge from wwt plants our present results were 1500 µg tbhqeq in c1 and 170 µg tbhqeq l in c2 reports from germany and australia on surface water affected by wwt discharge show lower activities of 5 16 µg tbhqeq l and 24 29 µg tbhqeq l respectively muller et al 2018 escher et al 2012 in summary the nrf2 activity in and around the el prat de llobregat wwt plant in this study was higher as compared to other published data notably the anthropogenic pressure on the llobregat river system i e its surrounding population density load of incoming pollutants and lack of dilution effect is markedly different compared to some of the freshwater systems from the other studies mentioned above in drinking water treatment increasing levels of tbhqeq have been reported within the production line neale et al 2012 hebert et al 2018 oskarsson et al 2021 lundqvist et al 2019 escher et al 2012 in one study source water had 18 µg tbhqeq l increasing to 42 µg tbhqeq l in finished drinking water escher et al 2012 in the present study no increase in activity was seen but rather despite very differing incoming levels of activity at 1500 µg tbhqeq l c1 and 33 µg tbhqeq l c2 the activity in finished drinking water s7 was equal in the two campaigns at 33 µg tbhqeq l additionally in the previously mentioned concurrent study on effects of chlorination on the reclaimed effluent in the llobregat river sanchis et al 2021 it was found that certain halogenated features persisted in the final drinking water our results however indicate that these formed features were not present at high enough concentrations or could not trigger oxidative stress response via the nrf2 pathway 3 4 1 aryl hydrocarbon receptor ahr activity we observed ahr activity in all tested samples fig 3 table 4 concentration response relationships are presented in fig 3 ec40 and beq values are presented in table 4 and removal efficiencies in tables 5 and 6 in influent wastewater s1 the ahr activity was slightly higher in c2 compared to c1 at 11 and 6 ng tcddeq l during secondary treatment s2 the removal efficiency was 72 and 81 in c1 and c2 respectively following tertiary treatment s3 the removal efficiencies were 66 and 76 respectively for c1 and c2 and tcddeq remained roughly the same between s2 and s3 in both campaigns at the end of the pipeline s4 the ahr activity increased in both campaigns as compared to within the treatment plant s3 the increase was most pronounced in c2 including chlorination treatment surpassing the tcddeq seen in the incoming water with 227 in c2 the ahr activity in c2s4 was the highest found among all the samples at 41 ng tcddeq l in the river the upstream samples s5 showed lower ahr activity in c1 as compared to c2 further downstream at raw water intake to the dwt plant s6 the ahr activity was equal in both campaigns at a range of 0 8 1 8 ng tcddeq l the removal efficiency for drinking water treatment was 87 and 83 as compared to incoming water a remaining ahr activity was found below 1 ng tcddeq l in both campaigns an increase in ahr activity after chlorination treatment as detected in c2s4 has not been reported in previously published studies the removal efficiency for chlorination treatment in c2 was 1284 comparing samples s4 to s3 it seems the increase in activity was either due to transformation products created by the addition of chlorine to the tertiary treated wastewater or the addition of chlorine triggered a release of ahr inducing compounds from within the pipeline as an increase in ahr activity was also seen in c1 without chlorination treatment perhaps a combination of the two mechanisms occurred a previously published study using a different cell line found an increase in cyp1a1 expression downstream ahr activation after chlorination treatment of sediment from a drinking water reservoir wu et al 2020 however further studies did not confirm this finding liang et al 2022 the increase in bioactivity between c1s3 and c1s4 is also depicted in the negative removal efficiency of 160 even though no treatment occurred in this campaign only water transport this suggests some unknown source of ahr active compounds within the pipeline 3 4 2 comparison of ahr activity with other studies several studies report complete or partial removal of ahr activity when comparing influent wastewater versus effluent water lundqvist et al 2019 chou et al 2014 nivala et al 2018 there are also reports of higher ahr activity in outgoing water as compared to untreated wastewater muller et al 2018 we previously reported ahr activities up to 400 ng tcddeq l in influent and up to 200 ng tcddeq l in effluent wastewaters lundqvist et al 2019 studies with considerably lower activities have also been reported with around 0 3 ng tcddeq l in wastewater nivala et al 2018 and in the range of 0 009 0 16 ng tcddeq l in surface waters affected by wastewater discharge konig et al 2017 muller et al 2018 regardless of the peak in ahr activity in c2s4 sample our results here are in the lower range compared to literature data an effect based trigger value ebt for potable reused water was suggested by the california water boards of 0 5 ng tcddeq l monitoring trigger limit mtl nori 2020 the ahr activity in drinking water samples in this study was the lowest of all tested samples at 0 1 and 0 3 ng tcddeq l in c1 and c2 respectively which was below the proposed mtl value of 0 5 ng tcddeq l for potable reused water following the california water boards guideline on this trigger value action is suggested to be taken when measured values exceed ten times the suggested trigger value which the data here did not 3 5 estrogen receptor activity 3 5 1 er agonistic activity estrogen receptor er agonistic activity was detected in all tested samples concentration response relationships are presented in fig 4 ec30 and beq values are presented in table 4 and removal efficacies in tables 5 and 6 the most potent activity was found in influent samples s1 equal to 1 077 000 pg e2eq l and 1 350 000 pg e2eq l in c1 and c2 respectively after secondary treatment s2 the activity decreased with a removal efficiency of 99 9 in both campaigns leaving a remaining activity of 630 and 440 pg e2eq l in c1 and c2 respectively at the end of the pipeline s4 the er activity was lower in c2 compared to c1 in c1 the activity was relatively unchanged between s3 and s4 with 6 removal going from 2240 to 2100 pg e2eq l in c2 however after chlorination treatment the er activity in s4 was reduced by 94 as compared to s3 from 360 to 24 pg e2eq l here despite an overall lower activity in c2 wastewater samples compared to c1 it seems chlorination treatment had a reducing effect on the estrogenic activity of the wastewater furthermore previous studies have indicated that chlorination may reduce estrogenic activity it has been hypothesized that the phenolic ring found in bpa e2 and ee2 can be susceptible to oxidation by chlorine lee et al 2004 wu et al 2009 lee et al 2008 li et al 2017 li et al 2016 consequently chlorination treatment could reduce estrogenic activity in water treatment as well as reduce microbial contamination lee et al 2004 wu et al 2009 lee et al 2008 li et al 2017 li et al 2016 in surface water s5 s6 the er activity was continuously less potent in c2 as compared to c1 samples upstream s5 discharge of wwt effluent as well as downstream discharge of wwt effluent s6 the er activity in drinking water s7 was the lowest of all tested samples with a removal efficiency greater than 95 in both campaigns the remaining activity in drinking water was below lod at 2 pg e2eq l in both campaigns 3 5 2 comparison of estrogenic agonistic activity with other studies the er activity expressed as e2eq in incoming wastewaters was determined to 1 077 000 pg e2eq l and 1350 000 pg e2eq l other reports on er agonist activity in incoming wastewater in the range of 800 250 000 pg e2eq l lundqvist et al 2019 nivala et al 2018 valitalo et al 2017 in effluent wastewater s3 we found bioactivity of 24 1990 pg e2eq l which was lower compared to other studies on effluent wastewater with activities in the range of 1000 40 000 pg e2eq l lundqvist et al 2019 nivala et al 2018 valitalo et al 2017 in effluent wastewater and surface water downstream wastewater effluent discharge bioactivities have been reported in the range of 10 300 pg e2eq l in a serbian river system konig et al 2017 400 pg 2000 pg e2eq l in a german river system muller et al 2018 and 800 6000 pg e2eq l in an australian river system bain et al 2014 it should however be noted that these studies have been conducted with different cell lines than ours which might differ in sensitivity our findings range between 40 2000 pg e2eq l at sample sites s3 s4 and s6 in the two campaigns and appear lower as compared with previously published data in surface water kase et al 2018 proposed an ebt of 400 pg e2eq l for environmentally safe levels of er agonists derived from n 5 different er assays the estrogenic activity observed in the surface water samples s5 s6 in this study was below this proposed value but it should be noted that the proposed ebt is assay specific in drinking water the world health organization who suggested a benchmark value of 1 ng e2eq l in drinking water for assessment of occurrence and treatment efficiency during the revision of the eu drinking water directive 2020 eu 2022 the european commission included this value in the watch list of endocrine disrupting substances of concern to the public in 2022 eu 2022 previously brand et al 2013 suggested an ebt value for drinking water for safe human consumption of 3 8 ng e2eq l and more recently the california water board recently suggested a mtl value of 3 5 ng e2eq l in potable reused water nori 2020 the estrogenicity observed in drinking water in this study was 2 pg e2eq l in the two campaigns and well below all the above mentioned trigger values 3 5 3 er antagonistic activity er antagonistic activity assessment revealed some presence of antagonistic compounds in three of the surface water samples fig s6 in si table 4 since no er antagonist activity could be detected in wastewater samples the source of er antagonistic activity in the river probably originated separate from el prat de llobregat wwt facility although no wastewater samples showed activity in this study a wwt study from germany reported on low removal of er antagonist activity wolf et al 2022 and similarly a recent review showed low removal efficacy of bioactivities in wwt and dwt enault et al 2023 compared to estrogenic agonistic activity the er antagonistic mode as an endpoint is not as widely studied and comparable data for surface water is sparse 3 6 androgen receptor activity 3 6 1 ar agonistic activity concentration response relationships of ar agonistic activity are presented in fig s7 si ar agonistic activity was only observed in influent wastewater with an activity of 4 dhteq l in the two campaigns the removal efficiency following secondary treatment s2 was 99 8 similarly leusch et al 2014 reported high androgenic activity in influent wastewater and no observed androgenic activity below lod for effluent wastewater in general the removal rate for androgenic compounds seems to be high across different wwt systems several studies from different countries report similar results as in this study with low or no activity in wwt systems lundqvist et al 2019 nivala et al 2018 valitalo et al 2017 van der linden et al 2008 as well as in dwt systems brand et al 2013 leusch et al 2018 3 6 2 ar antagonistic activity concentration response relationships of ar antagonist activity are presented in fig s8 si beq and removal efficacies can be found in tables 4 6 ar antagonistic activity was observed in most of the samples in c1 but only in the influent wastewater sample s1 in c2 the removal efficiency of secondary treatment was 95 in c1 and 88 in c2 in c1 there was a slight increase in activity after tertiary treatment from 3 to 15 ng ohfeq l at the end of the pipeline s4 the activity decreased again to 6 ng ohfeq l indicating degradation of ar antagonists within the pipeline in surface water at the point of drinking water intake s6 there was only a marginal difference in activity to that of the activity in the pipeline indicating little dilution of the activity compared to the raw effluent in drinking water s7 the remaining bioactivity was below detection limit in both campaigns previous studies on wastewater effluent and drinking water have reported data in line with this study lundqvist et al 2019 leusch et al 2018 rosenmai et al 2018 however we have previously found cases of ar antagonistic activity in treated drinking water at 0 9 µg ohfeq l oskarsson et al 2021 3 7 nfκβ activation the assessment of nfκβ activation in the hepg2 nfκβ cell line with tumor necrosis factor alpha tnfα as reference compound did not reveal any detectable activity in any of the samples figs s9 si though none of the samples showed activity in this study previous assessments of wastewater surface water and drinking water samples reported bioactivity for this endpoint konig et al 2017 hebert et al 2018 neale et al 2017 nivala et al 2018 overall result of the occurrence of chemical hazards in the water samples 3 8 summarised effect concentrations the effect concentrations expressed as ref are summarised in a heat map fig 5 the heat map illustrates that effects observed in incoming untreated wastewater decreased in the subsequent samples throughout the wastewater treatment process s1 through s3 for most of the studied endpoints see si 7 section for further discussion of removal efficiencies due to the operational strategy of the full scale trial and our chosen sampling strategy grab samples our results represent a snap shot of the pollutant pressure in this specific system at the time of sampling further research is needed to evaluate seasonal or temporal trends we can summarise three major findings in this study firstly at the end of the pipeline s4 as well as further downstream s6 and s7 no increase in nrf2 activity could be attributed to the additional chlorination treatment of effluent wastewater in the second campaign rather there was an increase in both campaigns with a larger increase in the absence of applied chlorination treatment secondly we detected an increase in ahr activity at the end of the pipeline in both campaigns but a stronger increase after chlorination treatment this could be due to a source of ahr agonists between sample points s3 and s4 or that chlorination treatment of wastewater effluent might cause ahr activating by products see section 3 4 thirdly we found a decrease in er agonistic activity after chlorination treatment indicating degradation of er agonists following chlorination treatment see section 3 5 despite varying bioactivity in the incoming water to the dwt plant s6 there were generally equal and low residual activities in the finished drinking water in the two campaigns this shows that the treatment methods at sant joan despí dwt plant have high removal efficiencies irrespective of the load of bioactivities observed in the untreated water additionally it demonstrates that this kind of wastewater reclaim set up for collecting source water for drinking water production can be made successfully without compromising drinking water quality for the health relevant parameters included in this study 4 conclusions our results indicate that for the endpoints studied indirect reuse of wastewater into drinking water sources can be successful without introducing chemical hazards in the finished potable water wastewater samples affected by chlorination treatment did not reveal a higher potency for oxidative stress as determined by the nrf2 pathway in surface water nor in drinking water as compared to their equivalent unchlorinated samples we detected an increase in ahr activity after chlorination treatment which has not been reported previously further research is needed to clarify the mechanism behind this finding additionally chlorination treatment seems to have reduced er agonist activity this study provides important knowledge relevant to the advancement of climate change adaptation efforts by applying an effect based evaluation of this system of freshwater distribution we have shown that intentional redistribution of treated wastewater into drinking water production could be an applicable and useful approach in safeguarding future water supplies funding this research project has been financially supported by the swedish research council for sustainable development formas

14623,indirect potable reuse of wastewater is a practice that is gaining attention aiming to increase freshwater supplies to meet water scarcity however reusing effluent wastewater for drinking water production comes with a paired risk of adverse health effects due to the potential presence of pathogenic microorganisms and hazardous micropollutants disinfection is an established method to reduce microbial hazards in drinking water but it has been associated with formation of disinfection by products dbps in this study we performed an effect based assessment of chemical hazards in a system wherein a full scale trial of disinfection by chlorination of the treated wastewater was performed prior discharge to the reciepient river the presence of bioactive pollutants was assessed along the entire treatment system starting from incoming wastewater to finished drinking water at seven sites in and around the llobregat river in barcelona spain samples were collected in two campaigns with and without applied chlorination treatment 13 mg cl2 l to the effluent wastewater the water samples were analysed for cell viability oxidative stress response nrf2 activity estrogenicity androgenicity aryl hydrocarbon receptor ahr activity and activation of nfĸb nuclear factor kappa light chain enhancer of activated b cells signaling using stably transfected mammalian cell lines nrf2 activity estrogen receptor activation and ahr activation was detected in all investigated samples overall removal efficiencies were high in both wastewater treatment and drinking water treatment samples for most of the studied endpoints no increase in oxidative stress nrf2 activity could be attributed to the additional chlorination treatment of the effluent wastewater however we found an increase in ahr activity and a reduction of er agonistic activity after chlorination treatment of effluent wastewater the bioactivity detected in finished drinking water was considerably lower compared to what was found in effluent wastewater we could thus conclude that indirect reuse of treated wastewater for drinking water production can be possible without compromising drinking water quality this study contributed important knowledge in efforts to increase the reuse of treated wastewater as a source for drinking water production graphical abstract image graphical abstract data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction safeguarding freshwater supplies from contamination by hazardous chemicals is of utmost importance to achieve the united nations sustainable development goal of universal access to safe drinking water climate change is expected to result in more frequently occurring droughts and other extreme weather events which in many regions could severely jeopardize the availability of clean drinking water masson delmotte et al 2021 additionally freshwater sources are under pressure due to urbanization high demand for irrigation purposes as well as a ubiquitous increase in chemical usage altogether these current and forthcoming societal challenges have increased the interest in drinking water supply systems that implement recycling of water

both in wastewater treatment and in drinking water treatment dwt processes is important to secure adequate removal of the incoming load of pollutants furthermore it is important to monitor the

associated with introducing chemical hazards in the processed water is disinfection neale et al 2012 hebert et al 2018 disinfection is a well established method to handle risks of microbial

there is limited knowledge on the toxicity of most of these compounds postigo et al 2021 specific dbps have however been linked to various cancers and other human health disorders srivastav et al 2020 a large proportion of adverse biological effects observed in water samples are caused by unknown chemicals or mixture effects neale et al 2020 escher et al 2020 for some toxicity endpoints as little as 0 1 1 of observed effects could be linked to known chemicals as demonstrated by bioanalytical methods escher et al 2013 this highlights the need of using analytical methods that can integrate the effects of both known and unknown chemicals as well as mixture effects when studying hazardous compounds in aquatic systems effect based methods ebms such as in vitro bioassays based on genetically modified mammalian cell lines have shown great promise in water quality assessments of waste and drinking water escher et al 2020 escher et al 2014 brand et al 2013 in catalonia spain water shortages have become a more frequent problem over the last decades in the highly urbanized area of barcelona the llobregat river functions both as a recipient for treated wastewater as well as a source of drinking water production marcé et al 2012 the catalan water agency aca set up a trial of reusing treated wastewater from the el prat de llobregat wwt facility to replenish the lower parts of the river rather than discharging into the mediterranean sea tertiary treated wastewater effluent was redirected upstream via pipeline transport the pipeline then discharged up to 2 m3 s the effluent into

be 100 reclaimed wastewater effluent pérez et al 2012 to reduce the risk of pathogenic contamination in the drinking water supply while still replenishing the city s drinking water source chlorination of the reclaimed wastewater effluent was tested in the summer of 2019 the aim of this study was to perform an effect based evaluation of the water quality in a full scale trial system for indirect reuse of treated wastewater for drinking water production in addition it was investigated whether chlorination of the treated wastewater would affect water quality e g by formation of new chemical hazards the overall objective of the present study was thereby to provide knowledge on the safe reuse of treated wastewater for drinking water production samples from the full water cycle starting from untreated wastewater to treated drinking water were analysed for seven toxicity endpoints including oxidative stress response nrf2 activity estrogen receptor er activity arylhydrocarbon receptor ahr activation androgen receptor ar activity and immune response by nuclear factor kappa beta nfκβ activation 2 materials and methods 2 1 water sampling grab water samples were collected at seven sample sites s1 s7 fig 1 and table 1 under the coordination of the aca in june and july of 2019 sampling sites were located in the lower part of the llobregat river basin between the inlet of the dwt plant of sant joan despí and a point 8 5 km upstream based on the hydraulic retention and residence time between the different sampling sites the samples were collected in scheduled timely accordance aiming to collect the same bulk of water parcel along the distribution system the difference between the two sampling campaigns c1 and c2 was that chlorination of reclaimed wastewater effluent was applied between sites s3 and s4 in the second campaign at a dose of 13 mg cl2 l sodium hypochlorite naocl fig 1 this dose of chlorine was set according to pump capacity limitations and was below breakpoint chlorination which was experimentally measured at 30 mg cl2 l the applied wwt methods at el prat de llobregat treatment facility include nitrification denitrification secondary treatment membrane filtration and uv treatment tertiary treatment at sant joan despí dwt facility treatment methods include two parallel treatment lines one treatment line consist of ozonation and gac filtration and the other line consist of ultrafiltration followed by reversed osmosis the two treatment lines are blended prior to final disinfection with chlorine water sample characteristics such as total organic carbon concentration toc mg c l ph and conductivity µs cm are described in table s1 in supporting information si 2 2 water sample extraction water samples volumes presented in table 1

adjusted to 6 5 using ammonia and formic acid solid phase extraction spe was performed according to gago ferrero et al gago ferrero et al 2015 spe cartridges were prepared in house using 6 ml spe

ystrad mynach uk spe extracts 500 µl 1 4 v v meoh etoh were stored at 20 c pending bioassay analysis a detailed description of the spe protocol is described in si 2 3 bioassays the water samples were analysed for seven toxicity endpoints of relevance for both human and ecological hazard identification table 2 all samples were tested in cell viability assessments to ensure that bioactivities were studied under non cytotoxic conditions a detailed description of the applied bioassays is given in si the seven endpoints were assessed along with solvent control reference compound and procedural blanks in stably transfected luciferase reporter gene assays in 384 well plate corning usa format a tecan infinite m1000 reader was used to measure luminescence after addition of luciferin the concentrations of samples studied in the bioassays are expressed as relative enrichment factors ref the highest ref tested was calculated as enrichment factor at spe x 0 01 100 fold dilution with cell medium at bioassay a ref 1 implies that the water sample has been enriched as compared to the grab water sample and a ref 1 that the sample has been diluted all bioassays were conducted with a constant solvent concentration 1 1 4 meoh etoh v v description of data evaluation and calculations of ec and beq values can be found in si 3 results and discussion 3 1 cell viability samples were tested for cytotoxicity in ar ecoscreen vm7luc4e2 mcf7arec32 hepg2 nfκβ and dr ecoscreen cell lines cytotoxicity was defined as cell viability of 80 compared to the solvent control the highest tested ref values were 20 for wastewater 50 for surface water and 100 for drinking water i e wastewater was tested at 20x enrichment surface water at of 50x enrichment and drinking water at 100x enrichment as compared to grab water samples table 1 most samples did not show cytotoxicity at the highest tested ref in any of the cell lines figs s 1 5 in si except for influent wastewater which for most cell lines had to be diluted to ref 2 5 to reach non cytotoxic conditions the following samples were cytotoxic at the highest concentrations and thus excluded from regression analyses sample c2s4 c2s5 and c2s6 were cytotoxic at ref 50 in dr ecoscreen figs s1 si sample c2s4 was cytotoxic at ref 50 in vm7luc4er figs s2 si and sample c2s3 was cytotoxic at ref 10 in ar ecoscreen figs s4 si additionally sample concentrations that showed signs of potential masked cytotoxicity i e displayed a negative trend of bioactivity with increasing ref were also excluded from regression analyses 3 2 procedural blanks in three of the endpoints in this study the procedural blanks milliq water concentrated over spe showed some bioactivity table 3 in the nrf2 assessment the two blanks from c1 and c2 showed activity at ref 20 the bioactivity was just above the cut off value in the two campaigns at the next tested concentration ref 10 no activity was detected one of the objectives here was to investigate the effect of chlorination treatment between the campaigns using nrf2 activity as an indicator of dbp formation since the background activity was borderline above cut off and comparably equal between the two blanks in nrf2 activity assessment we argue that this comparison could still be made successfully the two other endpoints were blanks showed bioactivity was ahr activation at ref 20 and er agonist activity at ref 20 through ref 5 table 3 samples s5 s7 were analysed at higher refs in all assays as compared to the other samples the samples analysed at the highest tested ref values were finished drinking water s7 however for er agonist activity for example the drinking water from both campaigns exhibited lower bioactivity at ref 20 than what the procedural blank did at ref 20 at around 2 and 6 of assay maximum hence the potential contamination of samples observed in the procedural blank did not seem to be as pronounced in the real samples we hypothesize that this might be due to the low ionic strength of the deionized water used to prepare the procedural blank which could make this blank sample extra susceptible to contamination from the spe process actual samples with a higher ionic strength did not seem to be as susceptible to contamination from the spe process we cannot rule out the possibility of overestimation of the endpoints tested at concentrations higher than the active blanks however to claim the contrary our er agonist and ahr data are comparably low in relation to literature data see sections 3 4 2 and 3 5 2 we argue that the intra sample comparison in this study can still confidently be made but some caution is advisable when comparing our data with other studies 3 3 oxidative stress response nrf2 activity oxidative stress response measured as nrf2 activity was observed in all analysed samples concentration response relationships are presented in fig 2 ecir1 5 and beq values are presented in table 4 and removal efficiencies in table 5 and table 6 the highest detected nrf2 activity was found in influent wastewater samples s1 at 2900 and 1500 μg tbhqeq l in c1 and c2 respectively after secondary treatment nitrification denitrification s2 the nrf2 activity was reduced compared to s1 with a removal efficiency of 93 in both campaigns in tertiary treated wastewater filtration uv treatment s3 the nrf2 activity was higher in c1 compared to c2 and there was an increase in activity in both campaigns compared to s2 at the end of the pipeline s4 there was an increase in nrf2 activity in both campaigns as compared to s3 with a negative removal efficiency of 66 in c1 and 33 in c2 the increase was hence larger in c1 as compared to c2 with chlorination treatment thus chlorination treatment could not be concluded to have a major impact on the nrf2 activity since there was an increase in activity both with and without chlorination treatment rather the increase between sample sites s3 and s4 indicates some contaminating factor within the pipeline contributing to an increase in nrf2 activity in the upstream river sample s5 the nrf2 activity was higher in c1 compared to c2 at 170 µg tbhqeq l in c1 and 20 µg tbhqeq l in c2 at the raw water intake to the dwt plant s6 the nrf2 activity increased compared to the upstream samples and was continuously higher in c1 at 1500 µg tbhqeq l as compared to 40 µg tbhqeq l for c2 thus the overall potency for oxidative stress in the river was higher in c1 as compared to c2 the reason for this difference in oxidative stress in surface water samples between the studied campaigns cannot easily be elucidated possible influencing factors during times of sampling include variations in river flow contaminant concentration and precipitation hence further research would be needed to explain these variations in oxidative stress in surface water despite the difference in nrf2 activity at drinking water intake s6 the nrf2 activity was equal and low in both campaigns after drinking water treatment s7 at 33 µg tbhqeq l in summary the oxidative stress response of the samples downstream of chlorination treatment in c2 was not higher compared to the unchlorinated equivalent samples in c1 s4 s6 s7 the applied dose of naocl in the chlorination treatment of effluent wastewater was 13 mg cl2 l breakpoint chlorination after which a residual amount of chlorine exists to elicit disinfection was experimentally measured at 30 mg cl2 l thus the applied dose was below breakpoint reaching breakpoint chlorination when disinfecting drinking water is vital to secure adequate disinfection in dwt chlorination treatment is typically applied at the end of the treatment process where the oxidant demand of the water is low normally at a dose of 0 5 2 mg cl2 l hence a much lower dose of chlorine would be needed to reach breakpoint compared to wastewater effluent with a high oxidant demand previous studies on chlorination of wastewater found an increase of certain dbps when dosing cl2 above breakpoint yang et al 2005 matamoros et al 2007 and it could be speculated that our results would have been different if breakpoint conditions had been reached a concurrent study of the same full scale water reclamation trial in the llobregat river assessing alternations on dom fingerprinting after chlorination treatment did reveal formation of halogenated species downstream chlorination treatment at doses ranging from 10 to 14 mg cl2 l sanchis et al 2021 3 4 comparison of nrf2 activity with other studies for incoming wastewater we previously reported nrf2 activities of 200 580 µg tbhqeq l from swedish wwt plants lundqvist et al 2019 and escher et al escher et al 2012 reported a range of 95 650 µg tbhqeq l from australian wwt plants which are both lower than in the present study at 2900 and 1500 µg tbhqeq l in effluent wastewater we found activities of 320 and 130 µg tbhqeq l which was higher compared to the australian data of 50 µg tbhqeq l escher et al 2012 we previously reported on tbhqeq in swedish wastewater effluent to be below lod in several cases and at 180 µg l in another case oskarsson et al 2021 lundqvist et al 2019 in surface water affected by discharge from wwt plants our present results were 1500 µg tbhqeq in c1 and 170 µg tbhqeq l in c2 reports from germany and australia on surface water affected by wwt discharge show lower activities of 5 16 µg tbhqeq l and 24 29 µg tbhqeq l respectively muller et al 2018 escher et al 2012 in summary the nrf2 activity in and around the el prat de llobregat wwt plant in this study was higher as compared to other published data notably the anthropogenic pressure on the llobregat river system i e its surrounding population density load of incoming pollutants and lack of dilution effect is markedly different compared to some of the freshwater systems from the other studies mentioned above in drinking water treatment increasing levels of tbhqeq have been reported within the production line neale et al 2012 hebert et al 2018 oskarsson et al 2021 lundqvist et al 2019 escher et al 2012 in one study source water had 18 µg tbhqeq l increasing to 42 µg tbhqeq l in finished drinking water escher et al 2012 in the present study no increase in activity was seen but rather despite very differing incoming levels of activity at 1500 µg tbhqeq l c1 and 33 µg tbhqeq l c2 the activity in finished drinking water s7 was equal in the two campaigns at 33 µg tbhqeq l additionally in the previously mentioned concurrent study on effects of chlorination on the reclaimed effluent in the llobregat river sanchis et al 2021 it was found that certain halogenated features persisted in the final drinking water our results however indicate that these formed features were not present at high enough concentrations or could not trigger oxidative stress response via the nrf2 pathway 3 4 1 aryl hydrocarbon receptor ahr activity we observed ahr activity in all tested samples fig 3 table 4 concentration response relationships are presented in fig 3 ec40 and beq values are presented in table 4 and removal efficiencies in tables 5 and 6 in influent wastewater s1 the ahr activity was slightly higher in c2 compared to c1 at 11 and 6 ng tcddeq l during secondary treatment s2 the removal efficiency was 72 and 81 in c1 and c2 respectively following tertiary treatment s3 the removal efficiencies were 66 and 76 respectively for c1 and c2 and tcddeq remained roughly the same between s2 and s3 in both campaigns at the end of the pipeline s4 the ahr activity increased in both campaigns as compared to within the treatment plant s3 the increase was most pronounced in c2 including chlorination treatment surpassing the tcddeq seen in the incoming water with 227 in c2 the ahr activity in c2s4 was the highest found among all the samples at 41 ng tcddeq l in the river the upstream samples s5 showed lower ahr activity in c1 as compared to c2 further downstream at raw water intake to the dwt plant s6 the ahr activity was equal in both campaigns at a range of 0 8 1 8 ng tcddeq l the removal efficiency for drinking water treatment was 87 and 83 as compared to incoming water a remaining ahr activity was found below 1 ng tcddeq l in both campaigns an increase in ahr activity after chlorination treatment as detected in c2s4 has not been reported in previously published studies the removal efficiency for chlorination treatment in c2 was 1284 comparing samples s4 to s3 it seems the increase in activity was either due to transformation products created by the addition of chlorine to the tertiary treated wastewater or the addition of chlorine triggered a release of ahr inducing compounds from within the pipeline as an increase in ahr activity was also seen in c1 without chlorination treatment perhaps a combination of the two mechanisms occurred a previously published study using a different cell line found an increase in cyp1a1 expression downstream ahr activation after chlorination treatment of sediment from a drinking water reservoir wu et al 2020 however further studies did not confirm this finding liang et al 2022 the increase in bioactivity between c1s3 and c1s4 is also depicted in the negative removal efficiency of 160 even though no treatment occurred in this campaign only water transport this suggests some unknown source of ahr active compounds within the pipeline 3 4 2 comparison of ahr activity with other studies several studies report complete or partial removal of ahr activity when comparing influent wastewater versus effluent water lundqvist et al 2019 chou et al 2014 nivala et al 2018 there are also reports of higher ahr activity in outgoing water as compared to untreated wastewater muller et al 2018 we previously reported ahr activities up to 400 ng tcddeq l in influent and up to 200 ng tcddeq l in effluent wastewaters lundqvist et al 2019 studies with considerably lower activities have also been reported with around 0 3 ng tcddeq l in wastewater nivala et al 2018 and in the range of 0 009 0 16 ng tcddeq l in surface waters affected by wastewater discharge konig et al 2017 muller et al 2018 regardless of the peak in ahr activity in c2s4 sample our results here are in the lower range compared to literature data an effect based trigger value ebt for potable reused water was suggested by the california water boards of 0 5 ng tcddeq l monitoring trigger limit mtl nori 2020 the ahr activity in drinking water samples in this study was the lowest of all tested samples at 0 1 and 0 3 ng tcddeq l in c1 and c2 respectively which was below the proposed mtl value of 0 5 ng tcddeq l for potable reused water following the california water boards guideline on this trigger value action is suggested to be taken when measured values exceed ten times the suggested trigger value which the data here did not 3 5 estrogen receptor activity 3 5 1 er agonistic activity estrogen receptor er agonistic activity was detected in all tested samples concentration response relationships are presented in fig 4 ec30 and beq values are presented in table 4 and removal efficacies in tables 5 and 6 the most potent activity was found in influent samples s1 equal to 1 077 000 pg e2eq l and 1 350 000 pg e2eq l in c1 and c2 respectively after secondary treatment s2 the activity decreased with a removal efficiency of 99 9 in both campaigns leaving a remaining activity of 630 and 440 pg e2eq l in c1 and c2 respectively at the end of the pipeline s4 the er activity was lower in c2 compared to c1 in c1 the activity was relatively unchanged between s3 and s4 with 6 removal going from 2240 to 2100 pg e2eq l in c2 however after chlorination treatment the er activity in s4 was reduced by 94 as compared to s3 from 360 to 24 pg e2eq l here despite an overall lower activity in c2 wastewater samples compared to c1 it seems chlorination treatment had a reducing effect on the estrogenic activity of the wastewater furthermore previous studies have indicated that chlorination may reduce estrogenic activity it has been hypothesized that the phenolic ring found in bpa e2 and ee2 can be susceptible to oxidation by chlorine lee et al 2004 wu et al 2009 lee et al 2008 li et al 2017 li et al 2016 consequently chlorination treatment could reduce estrogenic activity in water treatment as well as reduce microbial contamination lee et al 2004 wu et al 2009 lee et al 2008 li et al 2017 li et al 2016 in surface water s5 s6 the er activity was continuously less potent in c2 as compared to c1 samples upstream s5 discharge of wwt effluent as well as downstream discharge of wwt effluent s6 the er activity in drinking water s7 was the lowest of all tested samples with a removal efficiency greater than 95 in both campaigns the remaining activity in drinking water was below lod at 2 pg e2eq l in both campaigns 3 5 2 comparison of estrogenic agonistic activity with other studies the er activity expressed as e2eq in incoming wastewaters was determined to 1 077 000 pg e2eq l and 1350 000 pg e2eq l other reports on er agonist activity in incoming wastewater in the range of 800 250 000 pg e2eq l lundqvist et al 2019 nivala et al 2018 valitalo et al 2017 in effluent wastewater s3 we found bioactivity of 24 1990 pg e2eq l which was lower compared to other studies on effluent wastewater with activities in the range of 1000 40 000 pg e2eq l lundqvist et al 2019 nivala et al 2018 valitalo et al 2017 in effluent wastewater and surface water downstream wastewater effluent discharge bioactivities have been reported in the range of 10 300 pg e2eq l in a serbian river system konig et al 2017 400 pg 2000 pg e2eq l in a german river system muller et al 2018 and 800 6000 pg e2eq l in an australian river system bain et al 2014 it should however be noted that these studies have been conducted with different cell lines than ours which might differ in sensitivity our findings range between 40 2000 pg e2eq l at sample sites s3 s4 and s6 in the two campaigns and appear lower as compared with previously published data in surface water kase et al 2018 proposed an ebt of 400 pg e2eq l for environmentally safe levels of er agonists derived from n 5 different er assays the estrogenic activity observed in the surface water samples s5 s6 in this study was below this proposed value but it should be noted that the proposed ebt is assay specific in drinking water the world health organization who suggested a benchmark value of 1 ng e2eq l in drinking water for assessment of occurrence and treatment efficiency during the revision of the eu drinking water directive 2020 eu 2022 the european commission included this value in the watch list of endocrine disrupting substances of concern to the public in 2022 eu 2022 previously brand et al 2013 suggested an ebt value for drinking water for safe human consumption of 3 8 ng e2eq l and more recently the california water board recently suggested a mtl value of 3 5 ng e2eq l in potable reused water nori 2020 the estrogenicity observed in drinking water in this study was 2 pg e2eq l in the two campaigns and well below all the above mentioned trigger values 3 5 3 er antagonistic activity er antagonistic activity assessment revealed some presence of antagonistic compounds in three of the surface water samples fig s6 in si table 4 since no er antagonist activity could be detected in wastewater samples the source of er antagonistic activity in the river probably originated separate from el prat de llobregat wwt facility although no wastewater samples showed activity in this study a wwt study from germany reported on low removal of er antagonist activity wolf et al 2022 and similarly a recent review showed low removal efficacy of bioactivities in wwt and dwt enault et al 2023 compared to estrogenic agonistic activity the er antagonistic mode as an endpoint is not as widely studied and comparable data for surface water is sparse 3 6 androgen receptor activity 3 6 1 ar agonistic activity concentration response relationships of ar agonistic activity are presented in fig s7 si ar agonistic activity was only observed in influent wastewater with an activity of 4 dhteq l in the two campaigns the removal efficiency following secondary treatment s2 was 99 8 similarly leusch et al 2014 reported high androgenic activity in influent wastewater and no observed androgenic activity below lod for effluent wastewater in general the removal rate for androgenic compounds seems to be high across different wwt systems several studies from different countries report similar results as in this study with low or no activity in wwt systems lundqvist et al 2019 nivala et al 2018 valitalo et al 2017 van der linden et al 2008 as well as in dwt systems brand et al 2013 leusch et al 2018 3 6 2 ar antagonistic activity concentration response relationships of ar antagonist activity are presented in fig s8 si beq and removal efficacies can be found in tables 4 6 ar antagonistic activity was observed in most of the samples in c1 but only in the influent wastewater sample s1 in c2 the removal efficiency of secondary treatment was 95 in c1 and 88 in c2 in c1 there was a slight increase in activity after tertiary treatment from 3 to 15 ng ohfeq l at the end of the pipeline s4 the activity decreased again to 6 ng ohfeq l indicating degradation of ar antagonists within the pipeline in surface water at the point of drinking water intake s6 there was only a marginal difference in activity to that of the activity in the pipeline indicating little dilution of the activity compared to the raw effluent in drinking water s7 the remaining bioactivity was below detection limit in both campaigns previous studies on wastewater effluent and drinking water have reported data in line with this study lundqvist et al 2019 leusch et al 2018 rosenmai et al 2018 however we have previously found cases of ar antagonistic activity in treated drinking water at 0 9 µg ohfeq l oskarsson et al 2021 3 7 nfκβ activation the assessment of nfκβ activation in the hepg2 nfκβ cell line with tumor necrosis factor alpha tnfα as reference compound did not reveal any detectable activity in any of the samples figs s9 si though none of the samples showed activity in this study previous assessments of wastewater surface water and drinking water samples reported bioactivity for this endpoint konig et al 2017 hebert et al 2018 neale et al 2017 nivala et al 2018 overall result of the occurrence of chemical hazards in the water samples 3 8 summarised effect concentrations the effect concentrations expressed as ref are summarised in a heat map fig 5 the heat map illustrates that effects observed in incoming untreated wastewater decreased in the subsequent samples throughout the wastewater treatment process s1 through s3 for most of the studied endpoints see si 7 section for further discussion of removal efficiencies due to the operational strategy of the full scale trial and our chosen sampling strategy grab samples our results represent a snap shot of the pollutant pressure in this specific system at the time of sampling further research is needed to evaluate seasonal or temporal trends we can summarise three major findings in this study firstly at the end of the pipeline s4 as well as further downstream s6 and s7 no increase in nrf2 activity could be attributed to the additional chlorination treatment of effluent wastewater in the second campaign rather there was an increase in both campaigns with a larger increase in the absence of applied chlorination treatment secondly we detected an increase in ahr activity at the end of the pipeline in both campaigns but a stronger increase after chlorination treatment this could be due to a source of ahr agonists between sample points s3 and s4 or that chlorination treatment of wastewater effluent might cause ahr activating by products see section 3 4 thirdly we found a decrease in er agonistic activity after chlorination treatment indicating degradation of er agonists following chlorination treatment see section 3 5 despite varying bioactivity in the incoming water to the dwt plant s6 there were generally equal and low residual activities in the finished drinking water in the two campaigns this shows that the treatment methods at sant joan despí dwt plant have high removal efficiencies irrespective of the load of bioactivities observed in the untreated water additionally it demonstrates that this kind of wastewater reclaim set up for collecting source water for drinking water production can be made successfully without compromising drinking water quality for the health relevant parameters included in this study 4 conclusions our results indicate that for the endpoints studied indirect reuse of wastewater into drinking water sources can be successful without introducing chemical hazards in the finished potable water wastewater samples affected by chlorination treatment did not reveal a higher potency for oxidative stress as determined by the nrf2 pathway in surface water nor in drinking water as compared to their equivalent unchlorinated samples we detected an increase in ahr activity after chlorination treatment which has not been reported previously further research is needed to clarify the mechanism behind this finding additionally chlorination treatment seems to have reduced er agonist activity this study provides important knowledge relevant to the advancement of climate change adaptation efforts by applying an effect based evaluation of this system of freshwater distribution we have shown that intentional redistribution of treated wastewater into drinking water production could be an applicable and useful approach in safeguarding future water supplies funding this research project has been financially supported by the swedish research council for sustainable development formas

14624,plastics in landfills undergo a unique micronization process due to multi factor and light avoided conditions but their aging process in such a typical environment remains unexplored this study investigated the aging behavior of polyethylene plastics representative of landfills under simulated dynamic mechanical forces and high temperature two prevalent environmental factors in landfills the study explored the individual and combined contributions of these factors to the aging process results indicated that high temperature played a primary role in aging plastics by depolymerization and degradation through oh production while mechanical forces contributed mainly to surface structure breakdown the combined effect leads to more serious surface damage creating holes cracks and scratches that provide access for free radical reactions to plastic bulk thereby accelerating the aging and micronization process the resulting microplastics were found to be 14 25 0 53 μg l 1 aged plastics exhibit a rapid aging rate of depolymerization and oxidation compared to virgin plastics due to their weak properties suggesting a higher potential risk of microplastic generation this study fills a knowledge gap regarding the aging behavior of plastics under complex and light avoided landfill conditions emphasizing the need for increased attention to the evolution process of microplastics from aged plastic waste in landfills graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics aging behavior landfill mechanical thermal coupled conditions plastics data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction microplastics resulting from the fragmentation of large plastics have raised significant global concerns regarding their potential risk to both the environment and human health drummond et al al macleod et al 2021 ramsperger et al al while a portion of plastic waste is released into soil or aquatic environments where solar radiation accelerates aging and fragmentation of plastics khalid et al 2023 liu et al 2018 2022 yuan et al 2022 more than half of plastic waste is disposed of in landfills annually around the world which exhibit a unique and light avoided environment that differs from the other natural environments geyer et al 2017 kaza et al 2018 knowledge regarding the aging behavior and mechanism of plastics in this light avoided environment is limited but essential for a comprehensive understanding of the evolution process of microplastics and landfill reclamation plastic waste has historically been disposed of in landfills with a characteristic light avoided environment for several decades fei et al 2022 the complex environmental conditions within landfills such as extreme ph high temperature mechanical abrasion or pressure and microbial degradation can exacerbate the aging and degradation of plastic waste transforming them from persistent to fragile hao et al 2017 su et al 2019 under increased pore pressure from waste accumulation and extrusion leachate and landfill gas migration may bring different aging effects on plastic waste through the rinse immersed collision and corrode efforts li et al 2012 ma et al 2019 tong zhan tony et al 2015 during the landfill stabilization process the sequential settlement can cause the creep of waste which mechanically breaks down plastic waste through friction and shear force he et al 2021 swati and joseph 2008 as a bioreactor biodegradation process generates heat increasing the temperature to over 60 c in landfill bodies and aluminum reactions can result in an elevated temperature of over 100 c hao et al 2017 schupp et al 2021 stark timothy et al 2012 yeşiller et al 2015 properties of plastic waste undergo significant changes after several years of landfilling canopoli et al 2020 potrykus et al 2021 wang et al 2021 and an exponential increase in microplastics has been observed in a typical landfill with the disposal time extended huang et al 2022 given the tremendous accumulation of plastic waste in landfills it is important to identify the contributions of dynamic mechanical forces and high temperature to the aging and degradation of plastic waste in this unique environment fei et al 2021 geyer et al 2017 while attempts have been made to simulate the one dimensional static compression for aging and fragmentation of plastics mixed with sand lu et al 2022 the role of the dynamic mechanical abrasion from leachate and landfill gas migration is often overlooked plastic waste in landfills is buried in a light avoided environment for an extended period before being subjected to complex landfill conditions which may result in a different aging process than virgin plastic although many studies have realized the potential risk of plastic waste for microplastic generation in landfills the information on the aging and fragmentation of plastics under such unique light avoided and complex environmental conditions in landfills remains limited in this study polyethylene pe the most commonly found plastic in landfills with the range of 17 41 to 34 94 he et al 2019 su et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 was used as a representative plastic in this study virgin and aged plastics of 10 year disposal ages were employed to identify the aging behavior under mechanical and thermal conditions in a light avoided environment and the individual and combined contributions of the environmental factors were distinguished a comparison between the aging behavior of virgin plastics and aged plastics was made under mechanical thermal coupled conditions these findings enhance our understanding of the aging behavior of plastics under multi factor and light avoided conditions and provide critical guidance for developing strategies to mitigate microplastic pollution in landfills 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental materials the virgin and aged plastic films used in this study were sourced from huachuang plastic raw materials co ltd dongguan china and a practical landfill in shanghai after 10 years of landfilling respectively the plastic films were washed with deionized water and cut into 1 1 cm square for subsequent test fig s2a leachate sample was collected from laogang landfill in shanghai filtered through a 0 45 μm filter membrane and the properties are shown in table s1 2 2 simulation process to simulate the mechanical and thermal conditions that plastics undergo in landfills the plastic films were subjected to constant stirring with 200 rpm min and a temperature of 80 c using a thermostatic oscillator see text s1 for more details the experimental design and initial properties of virgin plastics and aged plastics are presented in fig s2b and s2c two grams of virgin plastic films were placed into a glass bottle containing 600 ml of leachate and the mechanical treatment mt thermal treatment tt mechanical thermal treatment mtt and mechanical thermal treatment with aged plastics mtt ap were applied to the samples negative control nc and positive control pc cases were conducted for virgin plastics using pure water and leachate without stirring at room temperature respectively the bottles were degassed with nitrogen gas for 5 min to get rid of the oxygen before starting the experiment and the degassed process was operated after every sampling to keep the anoxic environment all treatments were conducted in triplicate under light avoided conditions 2 3 characterization of the plastics and leachate the functional groups molecular weight surface structure surface chemical composition

text s2 and text s3 2 4 plastic aging index in order to identify the primary factor contributing to the aging behavior of plastics a plastic aging index pai was developed as a composite indicator based on chemical properties and surface characteristics including molecular weight carbon index o c ratio contact angle and surface roughness fig s3 each individual parameter was normalized to a scale of 0 1 and fitted with a linear function to obtain the slope k describing the rate of change for each indicator the pai was calculated as the geometric mean of the absolute value of k for each

normalized and fitted with linear functions using spss software spss statistics 19 ibm the graphs were drawn with originpro 2021 originlab co ma 3 results 3 1 surface abrasion of plastics the changes in surface structure and 3d topography during the aging process of plastics were revealed by sem and afm images fig 1 the application of mechanical forces caused distinct alterations in the surface texture of plastics resulting in interlaced scratches with an average roughness of 22 62 nm plastics in the tt case maintained their smooth surface indicating that the high temperature alone could not cause erosion on the plastic surface apparent surface abrasion was observed on the plastic surface when subjected to mechanical thermal coupled conditions with deeper scratches distorted holes and a higher average roughness of 32 28 nm aged plastics presented more holes microcracks and irregular wrinkles on the surface with an average roughness of 51 03 nm under mechanical thermal coupled conditions trace level quantification of plastic polymers were conducted using py gc ms to identify the tiny plastics released during the aging process as shown in fig s4 the mtt case had the highest concentration of microplastics at 14 25 0 53 μg l 1 followed by the mt case at 7 92 0 20 μg l 1 the result indicated that surface abrasion by mechanical force resulted in the formation of tiny plastic particles 3 2 aging behavior of the plastic properties 3 2 1 changes of the functional groups ftir spectra were utilized to investigate changes in the functional groups of plastics fig 2 a the characteristic peaks at 1658 and 1465 cm 1 were associated to c o and c h signals respectively the appearance of a new peak at 1041 cm 1 indicated the presence of the c o structure plastics aged under high temperature condition tt and mtt case exhibited stronger c o and c o signals compared to those subjected to mechanical treatment and control groups the mtt ap case displayed a strong c o signal implying that aged plastics were more sensitive to environmental conditions such as mechanical force and high temperature the time dependent ftir spectra of c o and c o signals were analyzed by heat maps fig 2b c the c o signal appeared obviously at 80 d and exhibited a strong intensity from 80 d to 140 d while the c o signal had a longer timescale ranging from 50 d to 140 d the sequence of functional group changes was explained by analyzing time dependent ftir spectra using 2d cos fig 2d i positive signals of cross peaks in the synchronous maps located along the diagonal line indicate the synchronization of functional groups the synchronous maps showed three primary auto peaks were observed at 1041 1465 and 1658 cm 1 along the diagonal line fig 2d f h asynchronous maps can reveal the sequential changes in functional groups with different treatment based on the consistency of signals between synchronous and asynchronous table s2 4 positive peaks were observed at ψ 1465 1041 indicating that the peak at 1465 cm 1 occurred prior to the peak at 1041 cm 1 the signals at ψ 1658 1041 and ψ 1658 1465 were negative indicating that the peak at 1658 cm 1 occurred later than the peaks at 1041 and 1465 cm 1 the sequential order of functional groups of plastic films was c h 1465 cm 1 c o 1041 cm 1 and c o 1658 cm 1 3 2 2 identification of the aging degree carbonyl index ci was used to reflect the aging degree of plastics fig 3 a see text s5 for details ci values of pe films increased significantly with aging time in tt and mtt case from 0 014 to 0 239 and 0 241 respectively however the ci value did not change much in the mt case and remained close to the control groups pc and nc case indicating that mechanical treatment alone did not have a significant effect on plastic aging the results suggested that high temperature promoted the oxidation of the plastics in particular the mtt ap case showed a sharp increase in ci value to 1 551 at 140 d an increase of more than ten times furthermore the oxygen to carbon o c atom ratio was analyzed to assess the degree of plastic aging fig 3b it was found that the o c values increased significantly to 0 38 in the mtt case at 140 d indicating that the mechanical thermal coupled conditions had a significant effect on promoting plastic oxidation the o c values of aged plastics reached a maximum value of 0 83 at 140 d indicating that the aged plastics were more susceptible to oxidation in contrast plastics treated with high temperature only showed a slight increase in o c values while the o c values in the mt case followed a similar trend to those of the control groups xps c 1 s spectra showed that the peak of the c c bond which is a characteristic component of polyethylene occupied 66 5 at 60 d but decreased to 63 0 at 140 d in the mtt case fig s6 on the other hand oxygen containing groups c o and c o showed increased intensities with values of 25 2 and 11 8 respectively at 140 d in the mtt case these results indicated that the c c bond was attacked and that the c o and c o groups were generated after oxidation occurred which were consistent with those of the fitr spectra shown in fig 2 3 2 3 evidence of depolymerization the molecular weight distributions of plastics are given in fig 4 a which provided a visual representation of the level of plastic polymerization when subjected to mechanical thermal coupled conditions both virgin and aged plastics experienced a decrease in molecular weights after 140 days of aging as compared to the other conditions the molecular weight distribution was further analyzed to dynamically describe the variations in mean mn values and dispersity over time fig 4b the molecular weight of plastics decreased steadily with increasing aging time from 42 685 to 19 989 g mol in the tt case in addition under mechanical thermal coupled conditions the mean mn value of virgin plastics dropped significantly from 42 685 to 7405 g mol albeit with a slight delay at the onset the dispersity increased simultaneously to 21 4 indicating a broadening of the molecular weight distribution the molecular weight of aged plastics also exhibited a sharp decline from 38 859 to 3921 g mol without any delay while high temperatures led to a decrease in molecular weight mechanical forces alone did not cause a significant change in molecular weight 3 3 dissolved matters responsible for the plastic aging the fluorescence eems spectra were used to identify the fluorescence compounds in this study fig 5 a the eems spectra showed three fluorescence peaks that were similar among all treatments applied to the plastics peaks located at 225 345 nm ex em were referred to the phenol like fluorescence groups while the peaks at ex em of 250 430 nm and 295 405 nm were assigned to the fulvic acid like and humic acid like compounds chen et al 2003 the intensity of fluorescent signals showed significant decrease in aging experiments fig 5a when compared to that at the initial stage fig s7 in particular the presence of high temperature tt and mtt case resulted in higher intensities of fulvic acid like and humic acid like compounds at 140 d which might originate from the plastics additives and chain scission li et al 2022 shi et al 2023 moreover the enhanced hydrophilic nature of the plastics made them more likely for the adhesion of organic matter to the plastics surface fig s8 the light avoided environment also allowed the dom to produce ros which accelerated the aging of plastics chen et al 2021 qiu et al 2022 the generation of ros was determined after 140 d of aging with different treatments by epr analysis fig 5b characteristic peaks of oh were clearly observed in tt and mtt case but not in the mt case indicating that high temperature might promote the generation of oh radicals qiu et al 2022 however no characteristic peaks of 1o2 were found in any of the treatments fig s9 4 discussion 4 1 driver forces identification for plastic aging process plastics were exposed to simulated dynamic mechanical forces and high temperature in a light avoided environment to investigate their aging behaviors in landfills after 140 days of aging plastics treated with mechanical forces alone showed visible scratches on the surface whereas plastics exposed to high temperature alone remained smooth fig 1 the combination of mechanical and thermal conditions induced significant changes in the surface structure of plastics including the formation of holes scratches and high roughness this suggested that high temperature accelerated plastic deterioration making them more fragile and potentially promoting surface abrasion ding et al 2020 li et al 2022 the observed surface damage resulting from mechanical force highlighted its negative impact on plastic surfaces which may be a primary contributor to surface abrasion cooper and corcoran 2010 wang et al 2021 mechanical force directly damaged plastic and created tiny plastic particles fig s4 which might explain the abundant microplastics found in landfill leachate sun et al 2021 functional groups in plastics were analyzed by ftir which revealed two new characteristic peaks at 1041 and 1658 cm 1 associated with the c o and c o bands respectively fig 2a the increase in oxygen containing functional groups during the aging process could be the reason for these peaks li et al 2022 2d cos analysis was performed to explore the sequence of functional group changes fig 2d i following to noda s rule lasch and noda 2019 mee jung and noda 2006 which concluded that c h c o c o thus it can be inferred that the c h groups in the plastic polymer was prone to be broken down preferentially forming the c o through an oxidation process which further oxidated to generate the carbonyl group c o these results were consistent with the previous findings which also artificially aged the plastics ding et al 2020 qiu et al 2022 the sequential order of functional group changes was also confirmed by the heat mappings of c o and c o fig 2b c where c o appeared over a broader time span than the c o region ci values of plastics in tt and mtt case showed a positive correlation with aging time p 0 05 which increased by more than fifteen times compared to initial stage fig 3a a similar increase was found in the o c values of plastics in the tt and mtt case especially the mtt case had a more significant rise in o c values fig 3b by contrast the mechanical forces did not significantly change the ci values and o c values these results suggested that the high temperature is a crucial contributor to promoting the plastic oxidation degradation celina 2013 ding et al 2020 results showed that the mechanical thermal coupled conditions seemed to cause a more remarkable oxidation degradation on plastic compared to individual thermal condition it can be inferred that the cracks and holes formed by the mechanical force might provide access for thermal oxidative degradation to the plastic bulk adamcová et al 2018 resulting in a more dramatic aging effect the aging and degradation of plastics is well known to be associated with molecular weight changes deng et al 2022 meides et al 2021 after 140 d of aging the molecular weight of plastics exposed to mechanical thermal coupled conditions had a significant decline in contrast to other treatments fig 4a and this decrease occurred earlier and more dramatical than those treated with high temperature alone fig 4b the plastics exposed to mechanical forces only did not change the molecular weight obviously the molecular weight of aged plastics decreased at the beginning without delay compared to virgin plastics which might result from the weak properties at the initial stage time dependent molecular weight change demonstrated the negative effect of high temperature on the intrinsic feature of plastics by promoting the depolymerization given the apparent reduction in molecular weight of plastics when high temperature was presented the polymer aging and degradation might proceed via chain scissions bhagwat et al 2021 meides et al 2021 the long chain plastic polymers were able to depolymerize into short chain compounds such as monomer and oligomer during the aging process resulting in a decrease in the molecular weight of plastics celina 2013 li et al 2022 studies have demonstrated the interaction between dom and plastics which may affect the aging and degradation process of plastic ding et al 2022 luo et al 2022 rummel et al 2021 the fluorescent components of dom were identified during the aging process of plastics fig 5a results showed that the fluorescent signals of dom in aging experiments at 140 d had a significant decrease compared to those at the initial stage which might result from the partial degradation of dom luo et al 2022 romera castillo et al 2018 particularly the mtt and tt case showed higher intensities of fluorescence signals than those in the mt and pc case it has been demonstrated that the plastics contained various additives and they could potentially release the dom into the surroundings particularly in the high temperature condition lee et al 2020 li et al 2022 shi et al 2023 as the enhancement on the hydrophilicity of plastics the organic matters might be more likely to adhere to the plastic surface fig s8 and interact with the plastics forming the plastic dom through a high conjugated effect resulting in the enhancement of fluorescence signals chen et al 2018 qiu et al 2022 in addition the dom could generate ros in dark environmental and these free radicals acted as the oxidants to trigger the oxidation reaction to promote the aging process of plastics chen et al 2021 liu et al 2019 qiu et al 2022 tian et al 2022 it is evidenced by our epr results that the oh was distinctly detected in the mtt and tt case fig 5b which can be inferred that the high temperature might promote the formation of the oh accelerating the aging of plastics qiu et al 2022 a comprehensive plastic aging index was established to reveal the contribution of environmental conditions to the aging behavior based on the change rates of plastic properties fig s3 the pai value is between 0 and 1 and the closer the pai value is to 0 the lower contribution of environmental condition to aging behavior as exhibited in fig s10 the pai value in the tt 2 60 10 3 was twice that in the mt 1 30 10 3 indicating that the high temperature played a leading role in the aging behavior of plastics compared to dynamic mechanical forces the pai value of mtt case reached 6 66 10 3 which is far greater than the sum of the pai value of mt and tt case indicating that the synergy between mechanical forces and high temperature might be responsible for the aging behavior in a light avoided environment 4 2 mechanism of the aging behaviors the underlying mechanism for the aging behavior of plastics under different conditions was proposed and outlined in fig 6 dynamic mechanical force contributed to the surface abrasion leaving interlaced scratches on the plastic surface with the formation of microplastics lu et al 2022 meides et al 2021 but this mechanical damage could not significantly change the plastic properties when exposed to high temperature the thermal oxidation directly deteriorated the plastic properties and oh derived from dom at high temperature might also act as an agent to promote the plastic aging shi et al 2023 in this case the breakdown of polymeric c c and c h bonds randomly occurred transforming the long chain structure into the short chain structure celina 2013 li et al 2022 notably the synergy between the mechanical forces and high temperature changed the plastic properties more dramatically than those exposed to high temperature or mechanical forces alone on one hand the high temperature induced the change in physicochemical properties led to a persistent to fragile process which made the mechanical forces more easily break down the surface structure forming deeper holes cracks and scratches on the other hand these injuries provided access for thermal oxidation and free radical reactions to enter the interior of the plastic adamcová et al 2018 resulting in a more violent aging behavior of plastics since plastic waste may have undergone a long term burial when exposed to complex conditions in the actual environment of landfills we also investigated the aging behavior of aged plastics obtained from practical landfills an enhanced roughness was observed on the aged plastic surface with increased surface damages fig 1 the oxidation degradation of aged plastics was more intense than that of virgin plastic with rapid growth of ci values and o c values fig 3 a distinct decline in molecular weight of aged plastics happened at the initial stage fig 4 suggesting the aged plastics tended to be more susceptible to mechanical thermal coupled conditions than the virgin plastics therefore aged plastics had a more significant aging behavior in contrast to virgin plastics during the aging process it is reasonable to believe that aged plastics would become more and more fragile with increasing time of aging to generate microplastics when they are subjected to complex environmental conditions in landfills this might be the reason that the generation rate of microplastics increased with the disposal time huang et al 2022 4 3 implications of this study landfills are the unique sites for plastic aging and degradation with multi factor and light avoided environmental conditions how complex landfill conditions contributed the aging and fragmentation of plastic waste is a prerequisite to understanding the evolution process of microplastics but remains unknown we take the first step to investigate the effect of dynamic mechanical forces and high temperature on plastic aging which could simplify the exploration of the mechanism of plastic aging and degradation under complex conditions in landfills it also offered further understanding on the evolution process of microplastic generation in long term landfill period our results confirmed that the mechanical thermal coupled conditions in landfills had great negative effect on plastic waste particularly high temperature is the main contributor to promote the plastic aging through generating ros and depolymerizing the polymers into short chain structure therefore effective measures should be taken to avoid high temperature occurred in landfills such as controlling the waste moisture preventing from the extremely high temperature caused by the participation of aluminum improving the methane gas collection to prevent the landfill fires besides our results found that the aged plastics seemed to have a more dramatic aging process than virgin plastics due to their weak properties and faster plastic fragmentation might occur as disposal time increasing huang et al 2022 it is noteworthy that plastic waste accumulated in landfills has already undergone a considerable aging process before being subjected to the complex landfill conditions resulting in the unimaginable potential for generating microplastics over the disposal period of several tens of years in particular the in situ aeration is widely applied in many landfills to accelerate the landfill stabilization process through high low pressure aeration and leachate recirculation raga and cossu 2014 ritzkowski and stegmann 2012 zhang et al 2023 but it ignores the role of human intervention in accelerating the aging and fragmentation of plastic waste thus appropriate aeration pressure and leachate recharging rate should be controlled while the elevated temperature should be avoided due to heat generation derived from the active microbial activities during aerobic remediation of old landfills in fact the actual environmental conditions of landfills were complex with the participation of multiple factors some environmental factors such as high physical stress and microbial degradation did not be taken into consideration in this study and will be the subject of forthcoming studies 5 conclusion this study examined the aging behavior of plastics in a simulated landfill environment under dynamic mechanical and thermal conditions while avoiding light exposure the results indicated that high temperature caused deterioration of plastic properties and increased oxidation and hydrophilicity leading to the acceleration of the aging process by producing oh however the surface of the plastics remained smooth mechanical forces contributed to the breakdown of the plastic surface structure resulting in visible scratches the contribution of high temperature to the aging process was twice that of mechanical forces as estimated by the plastic aging index the synergy between mechanical forces and high temperature induced a more dramatic aging behavior than environmental factors treated alone generated 14 25 0 53 μg l 1 of microplastics the pai value of mtt case was far greater than the sum of the mt and tt cases in this case mechanical forces caused significant surface damage of plastics such as deeper scratches and distorted holes due to the plastic deterioration accelerating by high temperature this surface damage provided access for free radical reactions to the plastic bulk accelerating the aging and micronization process the aged plastics demonstrated a more dramatic aging behavior than virgin plastics due to their weaker properties at the initial stage

14624,plastics in landfills undergo a unique micronization process due to multi factor and light avoided conditions but their aging process in such a typical environment remains unexplored this study investigated the aging behavior of polyethylene plastics representative of landfills under simulated dynamic mechanical forces and high temperature two prevalent environmental factors in landfills the study explored the individual and combined contributions of these factors to the aging process results indicated that high temperature played a primary role in aging plastics by depolymerization and degradation through oh production while mechanical forces contributed mainly to surface structure breakdown the combined effect leads to more serious surface damage creating holes cracks and scratches that provide access for free radical reactions to plastic bulk thereby accelerating the aging and micronization process the resulting microplastics were found to be 14 25 0 53 μg l 1 aged plastics exhibit a rapid aging rate of depolymerization and oxidation compared to virgin plastics due to their weak properties suggesting a higher potential risk of microplastic generation this study fills a knowledge gap regarding the aging behavior of plastics under complex and light avoided landfill conditions emphasizing the need for increased attention to the evolution process of microplastics from aged plastic waste in landfills graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics aging behavior landfill mechanical thermal coupled conditions plastics data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction microplastics resulting from the fragmentation of large plastics have raised significant global concerns regarding their potential risk to both the environment and human health drummond et al al macleod et al 2021 ramsperger et al al while a portion of plastic waste is released into soil or aquatic environments where solar radiation accelerates aging and fragmentation of plastics khalid et al 2023 liu et al 2018 2022 yuan et al 2022 more than half of plastic waste is disposed of in landfills annually around the world which exhibit a unique and light avoided environment that differs from the other natural environments geyer et al 2017 kaza et al 2018 knowledge regarding the aging behavior and mechanism of plastics in this light avoided environment is limited but essential for a comprehensive understanding of the evolution process of microplastics and landfill reclamation plastic waste has historically been disposed of in landfills with a characteristic light avoided environment for several decades fei et al 2022 the complex environmental conditions within landfills such as extreme ph high temperature mechanical abrasion or pressure and microbial degradation can exacerbate the aging and degradation of plastic waste transforming them from persistent to fragile hao et al 2017 su et al 2019 under increased pore pressure from waste accumulation and extrusion leachate and landfill gas migration may bring different aging effects on plastic waste through the rinse immersed collision and corrode efforts li et al 2012 ma et al 2019 tong zhan tony et al 2015 during the landfill stabilization process the sequential settlement can cause the creep of waste which mechanically breaks down plastic waste through friction and shear force he et al 2021 swati and joseph 2008 as a bioreactor biodegradation process generates heat increasing the temperature to over 60 c in landfill bodies and aluminum reactions can result in an elevated temperature of over 100 c hao et al 2017 schupp et al 2021 stark timothy et al 2012 yeşiller et al 2015 properties of plastic waste undergo significant changes after several years of landfilling canopoli et al 2020 potrykus et al 2021 wang et al 2021 and an exponential increase in microplastics has been observed in a typical landfill with the disposal time extended huang et al 2022 given the tremendous accumulation of plastic waste in landfills it is important to identify the contributions of dynamic mechanical forces and high temperature to the aging and degradation of plastic waste in this unique environment fei et al 2021 geyer et al 2017 while attempts have been made to simulate the one dimensional static compression for aging and fragmentation of plastics mixed with sand lu et al 2022 the role of the dynamic mechanical abrasion from leachate and landfill gas migration is often overlooked plastic waste in landfills is buried in a light avoided environment for an extended period before being subjected to complex landfill conditions which may result in a different aging process than virgin plastic although many studies have realized the potential risk of plastic waste for microplastic generation in landfills the information on the aging and fragmentation of plastics under such unique light avoided and complex environmental conditions in landfills remains limited in this study polyethylene pe the most commonly found plastic in landfills with the range of 17 41 to 34 94 he et al 2019 su et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 was used as a representative plastic in this study virgin and aged plastics of 10 year disposal ages were employed to identify the aging behavior under mechanical and thermal conditions in a light avoided environment and the individual and combined contributions of the environmental factors were distinguished a comparison between the aging behavior of virgin plastics and aged plastics was made under mechanical thermal coupled conditions these findings enhance our understanding of the aging behavior of plastics under multi factor and light avoided conditions and provide critical guidance for developing strategies to mitigate microplastic pollution in landfills 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental materials the virgin and aged plastic films used in this study were sourced from huachuang plastic raw materials co ltd dongguan china and a practical landfill in shanghai after 10 years of landfilling respectively the plastic films were washed with deionized water and cut into 1 1 cm square for subsequent test fig s2a leachate sample was collected from laogang landfill in shanghai filtered through a 0 45 μm filter membrane and the properties are shown in table s1 2 2 simulation process to simulate the mechanical and thermal conditions that plastics undergo in landfills the plastic films were subjected to constant stirring with 200 rpm min and a temperature of 80 c using a thermostatic oscillator see text s1 for more

containing 600 ml of leachate and the mechanical treatment mt thermal treatment tt mechanical thermal treatment mtt and mechanical thermal treatment with aged plastics mtt ap were applied to the samples negative control nc and positive control pc cases were conducted for virgin plastics using pure water and leachate without stirring at room temperature respectively the bottles were degassed with nitrogen gas for 5 min to get rid of the oxygen before starting the experiment and the degassed process was operated after every sampling to keep the anoxic environment all treatments were conducted in triplicate under light avoided conditions 2 3 characterization of the plastics and leachate the functional groups molecular weight surface structure surface chemical composition

in surface structure and 3d topography during the aging process of plastics were revealed by sem and afm images fig 1 the application of mechanical forces caused distinct alterations in the surface texture of plastics resulting in interlaced scratches with an average roughness of 22 62 nm plastics in the tt case maintained their smooth surface indicating that the high temperature alone could not cause erosion on the plastic surface apparent surface abrasion was observed on the plastic surface when subjected to mechanical thermal coupled conditions with deeper scratches distorted holes and a higher average roughness of 32 28 nm aged plastics presented more holes microcracks and irregular wrinkles on the surface with an average roughness of 51 03 nm under mechanical thermal coupled conditions trace level quantification of plastic polymers were conducted using py gc ms to identify the tiny plastics released during the aging process as shown in fig s4 the mtt case had the highest concentration of microplastics at 14 25 0 53 μg l 1 followed by the mt case at 7 92 0 20 μg l 1 the result indicated that surface abrasion by mechanical force resulted in the formation of tiny plastic particles 3 2 aging behavior of the plastic properties 3 2 1 changes of the functional groups ftir spectra were utilized to investigate changes in the functional groups of plastics fig 2 a the characteristic peaks at 1658 and 1465 cm 1 were associated to c o and c h signals respectively the appearance of a new peak at 1041 cm 1 indicated the presence of the c o structure plastics aged under high temperature condition tt and mtt case exhibited stronger c o and c o signals compared to those subjected to mechanical treatment and control groups the mtt ap case displayed a strong c o signal implying that aged plastics were more sensitive to environmental conditions such as mechanical force and high temperature the time dependent ftir spectra of c o and c o signals were analyzed by heat maps fig 2b c the c o signal appeared obviously at 80 d and exhibited a strong intensity from 80 d to 140 d while the c o signal had a longer timescale ranging from 50 d to 140 d the sequence of functional group changes was explained by analyzing time dependent ftir spectra using 2d cos fig 2d i positive signals of cross peaks in the synchronous maps located along the diagonal line indicate the synchronization of functional groups the synchronous maps showed three primary auto peaks were observed at 1041 1465 and 1658 cm 1 along the diagonal line fig 2d f h asynchronous maps can reveal the sequential changes in functional groups with different treatment based on the consistency of signals between synchronous and asynchronous table s2 4 positive peaks were observed at ψ 1465 1041 indicating that the peak at 1465 cm 1 occurred prior to the peak at 1041 cm 1 the signals at ψ 1658 1041 and ψ 1658 1465 were negative indicating that the peak at 1658 cm 1 occurred later than the peaks at 1041 and 1465 cm 1 the sequential order of functional groups of plastic films was c h 1465 cm 1 c o 1041 cm 1 and c o 1658 cm 1 3 2 2 identification of the aging degree carbonyl index ci was used to reflect the aging degree of plastics fig 3 a see text s5 for details ci values of pe films increased significantly with aging time in tt and mtt case from 0 014 to 0 239 and 0 241 respectively however the ci value did not change much in the mt case and remained close to the control groups pc and nc case indicating that mechanical treatment alone did not have a significant effect on plastic aging the results suggested that high temperature promoted the oxidation of the plastics in particular the mtt ap case showed a sharp increase in ci value to 1 551 at 140 d an increase of more than ten times furthermore the oxygen to carbon o c atom ratio was analyzed to assess the degree of plastic aging fig 3b it was found that the o c values increased significantly to 0 38 in the mtt case at 140 d indicating that the mechanical thermal coupled conditions had a significant effect on promoting plastic oxidation the o c values of aged plastics reached a maximum value of 0 83 at 140 d indicating that the aged plastics were more susceptible to oxidation in contrast plastics treated with high temperature only showed a slight increase in o c values while the o c values in the mt case followed a similar trend to those of the control groups xps c 1 s spectra showed that the peak of the c c bond which is a characteristic component of polyethylene occupied 66 5 at 60 d but decreased to 63 0 at 140 d in the mtt case fig s6 on the other hand oxygen containing groups c o and c o showed increased intensities with values of 25 2 and 11 8 respectively at 140 d in the mtt case these results indicated that the c c bond was attacked and that the c o and c o groups were generated after oxidation occurred which were consistent with those of the fitr spectra shown in fig 2 3 2 3 evidence of depolymerization the molecular weight distributions of plastics are given in fig 4 a which provided a visual representation of the level of plastic polymerization when subjected to mechanical thermal coupled conditions both virgin and aged plastics experienced a decrease in molecular weights after 140 days of aging as compared to the other conditions the molecular weight distribution was further analyzed to dynamically describe the variations in mean mn values and dispersity over time fig 4b the molecular weight of plastics decreased steadily with increasing aging time from 42 685 to 19 989 g mol in the tt case in addition under mechanical thermal coupled conditions the mean mn value of virgin plastics dropped significantly from 42 685 to 7405 g mol albeit with a slight delay at the onset the dispersity increased simultaneously to 21 4 indicating a broadening of the molecular weight distribution the molecular weight of aged plastics also exhibited a sharp decline from 38 859 to 3921 g mol without any delay while high temperatures led to a decrease in molecular weight mechanical forces alone did not cause a significant change in molecular weight 3 3 dissolved matters responsible for the plastic aging the fluorescence eems spectra were used to identify the fluorescence compounds in this study fig 5 a the eems spectra showed three fluorescence peaks that were similar among all treatments applied to the plastics peaks located at 225 345 nm ex em were referred to the phenol like fluorescence groups while the peaks at ex em of 250 430 nm and 295 405 nm were assigned to the fulvic acid like and humic acid like compounds chen et al 2003 the intensity of fluorescent signals showed significant decrease in aging experiments fig 5a when compared to that at the initial stage fig s7 in particular the presence of high temperature tt and mtt case resulted in higher intensities of fulvic acid like and humic acid like compounds at 140 d which might originate from the plastics additives and chain scission li et al 2022 shi et al 2023 moreover the enhanced hydrophilic nature of the plastics made them more likely for the adhesion of organic matter to the plastics surface fig s8 the light avoided environment also allowed the dom to produce ros which accelerated the aging of plastics chen et al 2021 qiu et al 2022 the generation of ros was determined after 140 d of aging with different treatments by epr analysis fig 5b characteristic peaks of oh were clearly observed in tt and mtt case but not in the mt case indicating that high temperature might promote the generation of oh radicals qiu et al 2022 however no characteristic peaks of 1o2 were found in any of the treatments fig s9 4 discussion 4 1 driver forces identification for plastic aging process plastics were exposed to simulated dynamic mechanical forces and high temperature in a light avoided environment to investigate their aging behaviors in landfills after 140 days of aging plastics treated with mechanical forces alone showed visible scratches on the surface whereas plastics exposed to high temperature alone remained smooth fig 1 the combination of mechanical and thermal conditions induced significant changes in the surface structure of plastics including the formation of holes scratches and high roughness this suggested that high temperature accelerated plastic deterioration making them more fragile and potentially promoting surface abrasion ding et al 2020 li et al 2022 the observed surface damage resulting from mechanical force highlighted its negative impact on plastic surfaces which may be a primary contributor to surface abrasion cooper and corcoran 2010 wang et al 2021 mechanical force directly damaged plastic and created tiny plastic particles fig s4 which might explain the abundant microplastics found in landfill leachate sun et al 2021 functional groups in plastics were analyzed by ftir which revealed two new characteristic peaks at 1041 and 1658 cm 1 associated with the c o and c o bands respectively fig 2a the increase in oxygen containing functional groups during the aging process could be the reason for these peaks li et al 2022 2d cos analysis was performed to explore the sequence of functional group changes fig 2d i following to noda s rule lasch and noda 2019 mee jung and noda 2006 which concluded that c h c o c o thus it can be inferred that the c h groups in the plastic polymer was prone to be broken down preferentially forming the c o through an oxidation process which further oxidated to generate the carbonyl group c o these results were consistent with the previous findings which also artificially aged the plastics ding et al 2020 qiu et al 2022 the sequential order of functional group changes was also confirmed by the heat mappings of c o and c o fig 2b c where c o appeared over a broader time span than the c o region ci values of plastics in tt and mtt case showed a positive correlation with aging time p 0 05 which increased by more than fifteen times compared to initial stage fig 3a a similar increase was found in the o c values of plastics in the tt and mtt case especially the mtt case had a more significant rise in o c values fig 3b by contrast the mechanical forces did not significantly change the ci values and o c values these results suggested that the high temperature is a crucial contributor to promoting the plastic oxidation degradation celina 2013 ding et al 2020 results showed that the mechanical thermal coupled conditions seemed to cause a more remarkable oxidation degradation on plastic compared to individual thermal condition it can be inferred that the cracks and holes formed by the mechanical force might provide access for thermal oxidative degradation to the plastic bulk adamcová et al 2018 resulting in a more dramatic aging effect the aging and degradation of plastics is well known to be associated with molecular weight changes deng et al 2022 meides et al 2021 after 140 d of aging the molecular weight of plastics exposed to mechanical thermal coupled conditions had a significant decline in contrast to other treatments fig 4a and this decrease occurred earlier and more dramatical than those treated with high temperature alone fig 4b the plastics exposed to mechanical forces only did not change the molecular weight obviously the molecular weight of aged plastics decreased at the beginning without delay compared to virgin plastics which might result from the weak properties at the initial stage time dependent molecular weight change demonstrated the negative effect of high temperature on the intrinsic feature of plastics by promoting the depolymerization given the apparent reduction in molecular weight of plastics when high temperature was presented the polymer aging and degradation might proceed via chain scissions bhagwat et al 2021 meides et al 2021 the long chain plastic polymers were able to depolymerize into short chain compounds such as monomer and oligomer during the aging process resulting in a decrease in the molecular weight of plastics celina 2013 li et al 2022 studies have demonstrated the interaction between dom and plastics which may affect the aging and degradation process of plastic ding et al 2022 luo et al 2022 rummel et al 2021 the fluorescent components of dom were identified during the aging process of plastics fig 5a results showed that the fluorescent signals of dom in aging experiments at 140 d had a significant decrease compared to those at the initial stage which might result from the partial degradation of dom luo et al 2022 romera castillo et al 2018 particularly the mtt and tt case showed higher intensities of fluorescence signals than those in the mt and pc case it has been demonstrated that the plastics contained various additives and they could potentially release the dom into the surroundings particularly in the high temperature condition lee et al 2020 li et al 2022 shi et al 2023 as the enhancement on the hydrophilicity of plastics the organic matters might be more likely to adhere to the plastic surface fig s8 and interact with the plastics forming the plastic dom through a high conjugated effect resulting in the enhancement of fluorescence signals chen et al 2018 qiu et al 2022 in addition the dom could generate ros in dark environmental and these free radicals acted as the oxidants to trigger the oxidation reaction to promote the aging process of plastics chen et al 2021 liu et al 2019 qiu et al 2022 tian et al 2022 it is evidenced by our epr results that the oh was distinctly detected in the mtt and tt case fig 5b which can be inferred that the high temperature might promote the formation of the oh accelerating the aging of plastics qiu et al 2022 a comprehensive plastic aging index was established to reveal the contribution of environmental conditions to the aging behavior based on the change rates of plastic properties fig s3 the pai value is between 0 and 1 and the closer the pai value is to 0 the lower contribution of environmental condition to aging behavior as exhibited in fig s10 the pai value in the tt 2 60 10 3 was twice that in the mt 1 30 10 3 indicating that the high temperature played a leading role in the aging behavior of plastics compared to dynamic mechanical forces the pai value of mtt case reached 6 66 10 3 which is far greater than the sum of the pai value of mt and tt case indicating that the synergy between mechanical forces and high temperature might be responsible for the aging behavior in a light avoided environment 4 2 mechanism of the aging behaviors the underlying mechanism for the aging behavior of plastics under different conditions was proposed and outlined in fig 6 dynamic mechanical force contributed to the surface abrasion leaving interlaced scratches on the plastic surface with the formation of microplastics lu et al 2022 meides et al 2021 but this mechanical damage could not significantly change the plastic properties when exposed to high temperature the thermal oxidation directly deteriorated the plastic properties and oh derived from dom at high temperature might also act as an agent to promote the plastic aging shi et al 2023 in this case the breakdown of polymeric c c and c h bonds randomly occurred transforming the long chain structure into the short chain structure celina 2013 li et al 2022 notably the synergy between the mechanical forces and high temperature changed the plastic properties more dramatically than those exposed to high temperature or mechanical forces alone on one hand the high temperature induced the change in physicochemical properties led to a persistent to fragile process which made the mechanical forces more easily break down the surface structure forming deeper holes cracks and scratches on the other hand these injuries provided access for thermal oxidation and free radical reactions to enter the interior of the plastic adamcová et al 2018 resulting in a more violent aging behavior of plastics since plastic waste may have undergone a long term burial when exposed to complex conditions in the actual environment of landfills we also investigated the aging behavior of aged plastics obtained from practical landfills an enhanced roughness was observed on the aged plastic surface with increased surface damages fig 1 the oxidation degradation of aged plastics was more intense than that of virgin plastic with rapid growth of ci values and o c values fig 3 a distinct decline in molecular weight of aged plastics happened at the initial stage fig 4 suggesting the aged plastics tended to be more susceptible to mechanical thermal coupled conditions than the virgin plastics therefore aged plastics had a more significant aging behavior in contrast to virgin plastics during the aging process it is reasonable to believe that aged plastics would become more and more fragile with increasing time of aging to generate microplastics when they are subjected to complex environmental conditions in landfills this might be the reason that the generation rate of microplastics increased with the disposal time huang et al 2022 4 3 implications of this study landfills are the unique sites for plastic aging and degradation with multi factor and light avoided environmental conditions how complex landfill conditions contributed the aging and fragmentation of plastic waste is a prerequisite to understanding the evolution process of microplastics but remains unknown we take the first step to investigate the effect of dynamic mechanical forces and high temperature on plastic aging which could simplify the exploration of the mechanism of plastic aging and degradation under complex conditions in landfills it also offered further understanding on the evolution process of microplastic generation in long term landfill period our results confirmed that the mechanical thermal coupled conditions in landfills had great negative effect on plastic waste particularly high temperature is the main contributor to promote the plastic aging through generating ros and depolymerizing the polymers into short chain structure therefore effective measures should be taken to avoid high temperature occurred in landfills such as controlling the waste moisture preventing from the extremely high temperature caused by the participation of aluminum improving the methane gas collection to prevent the landfill fires besides our results found that the aged plastics seemed to have a more dramatic aging process than virgin plastics due to their weak properties and faster plastic fragmentation might occur as disposal time increasing huang et al 2022 it is noteworthy that plastic waste accumulated in landfills has already undergone a considerable aging process before being subjected to the complex landfill conditions resulting in the unimaginable potential for generating microplastics over the disposal period of several tens of years in particular the in situ aeration is widely applied in many landfills to accelerate the landfill stabilization process through high low pressure aeration and leachate recirculation raga and cossu 2014 ritzkowski and stegmann 2012 zhang et al 2023 but it ignores the role of human intervention in accelerating the aging and fragmentation of plastic waste thus appropriate aeration pressure and leachate recharging rate should be controlled while the elevated temperature should be avoided due to heat generation derived from the active microbial activities during aerobic remediation of old landfills in fact the actual environmental conditions of landfills were complex with the participation of multiple factors some environmental factors such as high physical stress and microbial degradation did not be taken into consideration in this study and will be the subject of forthcoming studies 5 conclusion this study examined the aging behavior of plastics in a simulated landfill environment under dynamic mechanical and thermal conditions while avoiding light exposure the results indicated that high temperature caused deterioration of plastic properties and increased oxidation and hydrophilicity leading to the acceleration of the aging process by producing oh however the surface of the plastics remained smooth mechanical forces contributed to the breakdown of the plastic surface structure resulting in visible scratches the contribution of high temperature to the aging process was twice that of mechanical forces as estimated by the plastic aging index the synergy between mechanical forces and high temperature induced a more dramatic aging behavior than environmental factors treated alone generated 14 25 0 53 μg l 1 of microplastics the pai value of mtt case was far greater than the sum of the mt and tt cases in this case mechanical forces caused significant surface damage of plastics such as deeper scratches and distorted holes due to the plastic deterioration accelerating by high temperature this surface damage provided access for free radical reactions to the plastic bulk accelerating the aging and micronization process the aged plastics demonstrated a more dramatic aging behavior than virgin plastics due to their weaker properties at the initial stage
