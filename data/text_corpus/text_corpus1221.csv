6105,by changing the hydrological cycle urbanisation has led to frequent flooding worldwide these phenomena combined with climate change threaten the capacity of sewer networks for safe conveyance of runoff in this context there is a need for efficient methods of modelling sewer networks which are the main drainage systems used to deal with runoff accumulation hence this research emerged to provide an efficient alternative to specialised stormwater software in terms of time and input requirements to model urban flooding this was achieved through a methodology consisting of the combination of dependence measures in the form of factor and correlation analyses with machine learning classifier systems the use of dependence measures enabled minimising the number of variables required by learning classifiers to perform as predictors in estimating node flooding in sewer networks the proposed approach was tested in an urban catchment in espoo finland whose hydrological response had been previously calibrated and validated with the storm water management model swmm the comparison of the node flooding distribution across the catchment was carried out under different rainfall events associated with climate change as a result the methodology was demonstrated to be capable of reproducing the flooding results obtained both with swmm and multiple regression analysis mra approaches with high accuracy keywords climate change correlation analysis drainage modelling factor analysis learning classification urban flooding 1 introduction floods have been identified as the main natural threat endangering the well being of communities and individuals especially in a context of land cover and climate changes that boost both the frequency and intensity of these events hallegatte et al 2013 on the one hand the imperviousness of urban catchments is increasing to satisfy the transportation and technological services demanded by citizens thereby favouring runoff volumes and velocities skougaard kaspersen et al 2017 on the other hand the large scale impact of climate change on floods is subject to complex global circulation patterns which makes it difficult to simulate due to the differences from region to region kundzewicz et al 2006 the trends at the european level point to northern and north eastern regions as the most prone regions to experience a rise in flood frequency lehner et al 2006 the common approach to manage stormwater in urban areas consists of systems that capture water through drains and then convey it throughout networks based on manholes and pipes connected to each other until reaching an outlet the abovementioned effects of climate change and urbanisation threaten the efficiency of these systems since their capacity might be insufficient to deal with future extremes of precipitation huntington 2006 as a result flood frequency in cities is increasing due to the greater intensity of storms and the decreased infiltration capacity of urban surfaces peng et al 2015 in this context developing accurate and reliable models for floods simulation in sewer networks becomes essential to ensure the welfare of urban areas in terms of drainage consequently this topic has gained relevance in recent years within the research community traditional approaches based on the application of rainfall runoff computer programs are still widely used to model urban floods recently babaei et al 2018 employed the storm water management model swmm to model 22 subcatchments in the urmia city iran through calibration according to three rainfall events highlighting the runoff coefficient of the study area as the most relevant parameter in water accumulation jamali et al 2018 applied a pluvial flood approach capable of integrating drainage network and rapid inundation models to three urban catchments in melbourne australia reducing simulation time in comparison with existing software such as mike flood in a context of data scarcity re et al 2019 validated the simulation of synthetic storms in the dupuy catchment argentina through swmm using data collected by the community affected by floods zhou et al 2019 used swmm to simulate the response of drainage systems in hohhot northern china to the effects of climate change and urbanisation which involved mean increases in flood risk of 299 and 471 respectively an alternative to these conventional methods has been emerging in the form of statistical and or machine learning techniques neural networks have also been used for flood modelling purposes by assessing the capacity of manholes in sewer networks abou rjeily et al 2017 duncan et al 2013 reaching high efficiency in representing the real response of these elements to severe storms in the same vein zhang et al 2018 built several neural network models to predict water levels of combined sewer overflows in drammen south eastern norway pointing out to the importance of keeping a balance between accuracy and training time when choosing a specific algorithm darabi et al 2019 used two machine learning techniques to model flood risk in sari city iran from a series of conditioning factors reaching prediction rates of 93 5 and 89 2 through validation with flood inventory maps zhao et al 2019 compared three methods to produce urban flood susceptibility maps in beijing china proving that support vector machines outperformed both logistic regression and artificial neural networks overall the review of previous research in the field of urban flood modelling revealed a gap in what concerns simplicity and efficiency physically based approaches of conventional stormwater modelling software are time consuming and complex in terms of parametrisation which hinder their implementation as part of broad urban planning strategies moreover more versatile methods stemming from machine learning are demanding in terms of input requirements and biased towards the modelling of intense storms under these premises this investigation aimed at designing a methodology to model flooding in sewer networks through the combination of dependence measures in the form of factor 1 and correlation 2 analyses with learning classifiers 3 the two former 1 2 enabled minimising the number of variables required for flood prediction whilst the latter 3 served to classify the nodes forming sewer networks according to their susceptibility to reach their full capacity the proposed approach was tested through a case study catchment in espoo finland for different rainfall scenarios in order to check its accuracy under a variety of storm regimes 2 materials and methods fig 1 schematises the tiered approach proposed to model urban flooding in sewer networks which consisted of the sequential application of three main components first was the use of factor analysis to investigate the relationships and variability among a series of variables expected to contribute to urban flooding then the degree of association between these variables and the existence or absence of floods in the nodes in sewer networks was measured through correlation analysis finally the accuracy of a set of learning classifier systems to simulate urban floods was tested according to the tradeoff between true and false positive rates according to the widely used storm water management model swmm gironás et al 2010 and then compared with that provided by a multiple regression analysis mra approach jato espino et al 2018 the list of variables or predictors p i selected to model urban flooding is provided in table 1 although these predictors were divided into two groups depending on their nature they were all expressed in relation to the nodes to which the different subcatchments and sewer network elements were connected thereby enabling the application of the correlation analysis and learning classification steps depicted in fig 1 the only data required for the characterisation of these predictors was a digital elevation model dem an aerial photography and the geometric arrangement of the sewer network in the study area including the diameter of conduits and depth of nodes hence the processing of these data with the support of several spatial and statistical tools available in geographic information systems gis enabled defining all the predictors considered 2 1 factor analysis although the set of predictors listed in table 1 was expected to provide a comprehensive representation of the main aspects affecting urban floods it was also assumed to contain some variables correlated to each other this was supported by the fact that the predictors referred to different parameters related to the same physical entities subcatchments conduits or nodes with this in mind the first step in the methodology concerned the examination of the variability among the predictors proposed in order to try summarising most of the information included in them into broader groups or factors this process was accomplished through the use of factor analysis spearman 1904 whose purpose is to reduce a large number of variables into a smaller set of latent factors that are easier to interpret harman 1976 factor analysis is therefore a statistical technique to reduce data dimensionality eq 1 formulates its mathematical representation where x is the n vector of variables or predictors μ is the n vector of means l is a n m matrix of loadings f is a m vector of common factors and ε is a n vector of residuals 1 x μ l f ε the extraction method selected to estimate the factor loadings was principal components since this approach implies no distributional assumption and is also less susceptible than other alternatives e g maximum likelihood to yield solutions that fail to converge fabrigar et al 1999 when using this method l is expressed as indicated in eq 2 2 l λ 1 e 1 λ 2 e 2 λ m e m where λ i and e i i 1 m represent the eigenvalues and eigenvectors associated with the factors the eigenvalues were also used to produce a scree plot which represents them in descending order versus the factor number this plot can be divided into three differentiated parts including a very steep curve a bend and finally a flat area according to kaiser s rule the number of factors in which to reduce the initial variables correspond to those whose eigenvalue is greater than 1 kaiser 1960 to facilitate the interpretation of the factor loadings they were transformed using the varimax method which is the most widely used option for orthogonal rotation fabrigar et al 1999 it seeks to make the loadings either large or small by maximising the variance of their squared values within the factors kaiser 1958 the sums of the squared loadings result in the communalities which represent the variability explained by the factors overall the proportion of variance v a r explained by each j th factor is determined according to its eigenvalue λ j and the trace of the correlation matrix tr r as specified in eq 3 3 v a r λ j tr r although the common application of factor analysis usually aims at reducing a greater number of variables to a smaller set to facilitate their interpretation rummel 1988 its underlying purpose is completely aligned with the objectives of this research since it seeks to understand what constructs underlie the data used as inputs in other words this analysis served to reduce the list of predictors presented in table 1 to a few factors thereby enabling the determination of the variables that were strictly necessary to model urban flooding based on their correlation with the condition of the nodes flooded or non flooded in sewer networks 2 2 correlation analysis once the predictors were arranged according to the percent of variance explained next was the selection of those variables achieving the highest loadings in the factors formed this enabled measuring their degree of association with the situation of the nodes in sewer networks in terms of flooding hence this step sought to explore the relationships between continuous variables represented by the predictors compiled in table 1 and the dichotomous variable provided by the absence 0 or presence 1 of floods in sewer networks consequently these relationships were modelled using the point biserial correlation coefficient γ p b which is the appropriate measure to apply when dealing with this combination of variables the formulation of γ p b which is provided in eq 4 sheskin 2003 assumes that the dichotomous variable is divided into two groups namely η 0 and η 1 in this context these terms corresponded to non flooded 0 and flooded 1 nodes respectively accordingly υ 0 and υ 1 are the mean values of the continuous variables for the nodes included in η 0 and η 1 whilst s η stands for the standard deviation of the υ values in the total sample size eq 5 denoted as η η 0 η 1 4 γ p b υ 1 υ 0 s η η 1 η 0 η η 1 5 s η υ 2 υ 2 η η 1 whilst the strength of the relationships between the continuous and dichotomous variables was measured from 1 to 1 according to the values of γ p b obtained from eq 4 their validity was checked by comparing their p values to the significance level α which was set at 0 05 fisher 1925 if the p value is larger than α there is not enough evidence to prove the existence of a linear relationship between the variables and vice versa in case the p value is smaller than α the values of γ p b achieved by those predictors that previously reached high loadings in factor analysis were taken as an indicator for building the predictive models intended to simulate urban floods using learning classifier systems this course of action prevented issues of overfitting in the last step of the methodology due to the inclusion of an excessive amount of predictors thereby leading to obtain concise models based on significant inputs 2 3 learning classification the information produced in previous steps was used to model urban floods through supervised learning classification a branch of machine learning where an algorithm gets insight into how to address new observations based on the experience gained by training data referred to the relationships between inputs and outputs huang et al 2002 in the context of urban flooding the outputs were available in a binary form 0 non flooded nodes and 1 flooded nodes hence learning classifiers were used to model the relationships between these two categories and the statistically significant predictors identified through factor and correlation analyses overall four different groups of classification learners were considered to undertake this task decision trees support vector machines k nearest neighbour classifiers and ensemble classifiers table 2 provides a summary of the main features of the algorithms corresponding to the four groups tested the values of speed and memory usage were obtained by testing several datasets amounting to up to 7000 observations 80 predictors and 50 classes the mathworks 2018 although these figures might change depending on the capabilities of the machines used they are useful in providing a comparison among the computing demands associated with each method regarding flexibility this parameter concerns the tendency of the algorithms to account for negligible variations that may lead to overfitting the models decision trees are formed of nodes branches and leaves hence they work as an iterative breakdown technique that starting from a dependent variable or response in the form of class leaf node produces groups defined by combinations of the values branches of independent variables or predictors root nodes including all the observations in the sample hastie et al 2009 the tree is usually pruned in subsequent steps to prevent overfitting issues since this approach is rather sensitive to this phenomenon support vector machines work as a linear classifier that separates data into two groups by identifying an ideal hyperplane maximising the distance between the support vectors which represent the closest points between categories vapnik 1995 the remaining data points are not taken into account to determine this hyperplane hence the points labelled with one of the classes stay at one side of the hyperplane and vice versa for the others unlike decision trees support vector machines do not tend to overfit data the k nearest neighbour algorithm is a lazy learning method based on instances such that new instances needing to be classified are compared with previous examples through a metric distance mitchell 1997 thus the k nearest instances previously considered are used to determine which class should be allocated to the new query instance for instance if k 3 and these neighbours are distributed in a ratio of 2 1 the algorithm assigns the new instance to the class containing two points ensemble classifiers emerged to improve the performance of individual classifiers by combining them and maximising their separate strengths kittler et al 1998 this helps reduce some of the main causes for poor fitting such as variance and bias there are different approaches to conduct this merger depending on whether estimations are built independently breiman 1996 or sequentially freund and schapire 1996 the former might be the best option if the issue with individual classifiers is overfitting whereas the latter may provide better results in terms of bias the accuracy of these classifiers was tested through cross validation this approach is based on partitioning the dataset into a number of folds such that the following steps are applied for 1 train a model for each fold using the observations not contained in them 2 evaluate the performance of the models from the data included in their corresponding folds and 3 determine the mean error of the test taking into account all the folds unlike holdout validation which divides the whole dataset into two different subsets for training and testing purposes this method is recommended for small samples because it uses all the observations for training bengio and grandvalet 2004 given the common size of urban catchments and the number of nodes in them that may perform as observations cross validation was the method chosen for testing the accuracy of the algorithms listed in table 2 to classify between flooded and non flooded cases 3 results and discussion the results of this investigation stemmed from the application of the proposed methodology to an urban catchment situated in espoo southern finland as a graphical summary of the variables considered in table 1 fig 2 represents the distribution of the nodes 75 and conduits 80 forming the sewer network in the study area which was divided into a series of subcatchments 79 characterised by their slope and average percentage of imperviousness the delineation of the catchment as well as the calculation of the slope and degree of imperviousness in its subcatchments were determined with the support of geographic information systems gis jato espino et al 2017 the hydrological response of the study catchment depicted in fig 2 was calibrated and validated by jato espino et al 2017 through the simulation of 6 real storms monitored during 2006 using the storm water management model swmm then the effects of climate change on the catchment were assessed by simulating a set of synthetic storms designed using the alternating block method jato espino et al 2017 these synthetic rainfall events corresponded to different return periods t and the representative concentration pathway rcp 8 5 w m2 which is the most unfavourable climate change scenario and represents a continuous rise in radiative forcing during the 21st century van vuuren et al 2011 table 3 indicates the duration and depth of all these storms real and synthetic in the case of the real storms the goodness of fit measures obtained for the simulation of the outflow in the catchment using swmm are provided too in the form of root sum squared error rsse coefficient of determination r 2 and nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient e finally table 3 also shows the number of flooded nodes determined when modelling the rcp8 5 synthetic storms with both swmm jato espino et al 2017 and multiple regression analysis mra jato espino et al 2018 these synthetic storms were built using the alternating block method from intensity duration frequency idf curves jato espino et al 2017 for the sake of comparison the mra based results were dichotomised since they were expressed as flooding probability in the original investigation therefore values of 0 and 1 were assigned to probabilities below and above 50 respectively hence the results stemming from this investigation concerned the modelling of node flooding in the study catchment fig 2 when simulating a variety of storms table 3 using a combination of factor and correlation analyses with learning classifier systems in order to compare the results achieved with those obtained with swmm and mra consistent with the approach taken to describe the methodology the results are presented sequentially according to the three components forming it 3 1 factor analysis the application of the proposed methodology started with the generation of the scree plot depicted in fig 3 which shows the eigenvalues corresponding to the list of predictors included in table 1 the horizontal line drawn to cross the value of 1 in the vertical axis kaiser 1960 coincided with the bend of the plot suggesting that the number of factors into which the initial set of 14 predictors should be divided was 5 once the number of factors was determined factor analysis was applied using principal components as method of extraction and varimax as type of rotation the main results yielded by the test are compiled in table 4 including the values of rotated factor loadings communality and variance expressed both as a decimal and as a percentage overall the values of communality achieved pointed out to the diameter of the immediately preceding p 10 and subsequent p 11 conduits to the nodes as the variables that were best explained by the factors followed by subcatchment area p 1 average preceding diameter of conduits p 9 and subsequent length of conduit p 8 in accordance with the values of communality the rotated loadings corresponding to the first factor which explained most than a quarter of the total variance represented the geometric characteristics of the conduits especially in what concerns their diameter p 9 p 10 and p 11 in contrast the second most explanatory factor concerned the geometry of subcatchments in terms of their area p 1 and width p 3 such that the two most relevant factors represented the two groups into which the predictors were divided table 1 the logic behind factor 3 was not so evident since it allocated the highest loadings to subcatchment imperviousness p 2 and subsequent length of conduits p 8 the relationship between these two variables lied on the capacity of the nodes linking both elements on the one hand highly impervious subcatchments contribute to increasing the volume and velocity of runoff and therefore the amount of water captured by the nodes on the other hand the length of subsequent conduits enable conveying large and rapidly accumulated runoff thereby preventing the existence of floods in the nodes factors 4 and 5 mainly involved the slope of subcatchments p 4 and conduits p 12 p 13 and p 14 as well as the depth of the nodes p 5 forming sewer networks the association of the latter with the slope related variables was coherent since the inclination requirements of the conduits to avoid either sedimentation or erosion issues limit the invert elevation of the nodes these two factors explained 12 3 and 10 4 of the variability in the data contributing to achieve an overall value of v a r of 76 4 the information derived from the factors summarised in table 4 served to support the correlation analysis conducted in the next step the rotated loadings stemming from the application of factor analysis indicated which predictors provided greater insight into the percentage of variability explained in each group suggesting which combinations of predictors should be examined in terms of their relationship to the occurrence of floods in sewer networks 3 2 correlation analysis in parallel with the application of factor analysis the degree of association between the values of the variables contained in table 1 and flood presence in the nodes was modelled with the support of correlation analysis table 5 since the flood related results obtained through the application of swmm were those stemming from simulations validated with real data jato espino et al 2017 they were used as a baseline for implementing the proposed approach given the nature of the predictors continuous and the response binary this step was approached through the point biserial correlation coefficient γ p b as formulated in eq 4 these results highlighted two main aspects having a positive and significant p values 0 05 correlation with the occurrence of urban floods subcatchment area p 1 and the geometric features of conduits diameter especially p 10 and length p 6 and p 7 the relationship of the size of subcatchments to flooding was evident since large contributing areas facilitate runoff accumulation and therefore the amount of water received by the nodes regarding the characteristics of the conduits the positive correlation between their diameter and lengths and flooding pointed out to the design criteria of urban drainage systems despite the dimensions of these elements are projected to be greater at the locations where runoff is expected to accumulate flooding hotspots remain in critical areas due to their flatness and high degree of imperviousness which hinder the capture of water based on the factors and correlation coefficients collected in tables 4 and 5 respectively a list of combinations of predictors were proposed to perform as inputs in the application of learning classifiers as a result table 6 summarises the minimum number of variables to consider in the modelling of urban floods with the limitation of using no more than one statistically significant predictor per factor overall this cross selection process revealed that urban floods may be essentially explained through four main aspects such that at least three of them were found to be relevant under every return period preceding diameter of conduit p 10 subcatchment area p 1 preceding length of conduit p 7 and node invert elevation p 5 these results highlighted by their representativeness since all the physical elements involved in the modelling of urban floods subcatchments conduits and nodes were epitomised by at least one variable in principle the variables included in table 6 were the predictors used to model urban flooding through learning classifiers however in those cases in which this initial selection was not sufficient to yield satisfactory estimates the inclusion of additional predictors according to the results of both tables 4 and 5 was examined to increase the accuracy of the predictions made 3 3 learning classification the use of learning classifiers from the combinations of predictors proposed in table 6 was preceded by the determination of the number of folds or divisions into which partition the observations available at the study area since the sample size the number of nodes was small the number of folds was established at 10 to avoid an increase in variance favoured by the instability of forming larger training sets kohavi 1995 the results stemming from testing the accuracy of the learning classifiers summarised in table 2 highlighted the suitability of the algorithms collected in table 7 to classify the number of total non flooded 0 flooded 1 nodes identified with swmm for the climate scenarios considered the combinations of predictors proposed in table 6 were valid to yield accurate estimates under all return periods except t 50 yr hence p 6 was incorporated into the model since this was the remaining statistically significant predictor for this scenario table 5 and was also found to be relevant in several factors table 4 as a result the classification associated with this scenario improved considerably the average values of prediction accuracy in table 7 proved the difficulties to classify the nodes in the category 1 under shorter return periods which increased proportionally to the number of flooded nodes in the datasets this correspondence between learning classifiers and climate scenarios revealed a decrease in the complexity of the algorithms as long as the return periods increased this might be related to the distribution of non flooded and flooded nodes for the storms considered since this ratio was markedly biased for short return periods the fact that the number of problematic nodes was very reduced in these cases could hinder reaching satisfactory predictions whilst the accuracy increased for more intense storms due to their better balance between flooded and non flooded nodes the complete performance of these classifiers is depicted in fig 4 which specifies the ratio of nodes correctly true positive rate and incorrectly false positive rate allocated to the flooded and non flooded categories identified using the validated models obtained with swmm the number of iterations run to classify the datasets under the different return periods was 50 since there was a strong convergence of results once this figure was reached as a proof of this evidence the average prediction accuracy achieved after 40 and 50 trials only differed 0 25 from each other with the maximum disparities corresponding to the flooded nodes for the t 5 yr storm 1 51 the values of prediction accuracy stemming from the classifications shown in fig 4 were examined through an outlier analysis the box plot chart represented in fig 5 revealed the presence of some outliers in the estimates related to all return periods the distribution of these outliers was uneven but they never were above 4 for any scenario which means 2 67 out of the whole sample of values 150 trials broken down into total non flooded and flooded nodes to further analyse the accuracy of the proposed methodology the classifications provided by the models schematised in table 7 were mapped and compared with those achieved with mra in order to evaluate them against the approach taken as a baseline swmm fig 6 shows the similarity between these three alternatives for the 5 yr and 25 yr return periods according to these maps 87 80 and 85 37 of the nodes in the study catchment conserved the same classification when using learning classifier systems respectively although these figures increased to 95 12 and 87 80 in the case of mra machine learning emerged as a more conservative option due to its slight overestimation of the number of flooded nodes in the catchment which might be desirable in a context of climate change and urbanisation besides the proposed methodology remained as a simpler alternative in terms of implementation since the mra framework used as a benchmark requires the combination of up to three different types of regression models linear nonlinear and logistic therefore these results demonstrated its validity and convenience to determine flooding in sewer networks and replicate the outputs achieved through the use of physical stormwater software and statistical approaches which represent the most widely used means to model urban drainage systems 4 conclusions this research designed tested and validated a methodology to model flooding in sewer networks from the combination of learning classification systems with factor and correlation analyses the latter two components sought to minimise the number of variables required to perform as inputs in the application of learning classifiers thereby simplifying the interpretation of results and reducing the computational costs demanded by the algorithms these classification algorithms provide an alternative approach to model urban floods by grouping the nodes forming sewer networks according to their susceptibility to reach their full capacity the results obtained highlighted the benefits provided by the coupling of factor and correlation analysis to facilitate the choice of the minimum amount of predictors required to model floods in sewer networks using learning classifiers on average only four variables were identified as necessary to classify flooded and non flooded nodes in the catchment used as a case study under four return periods with different intensities after testing 20 different algorithms the fits achieved suggested a decrease in the complexity of the classifiers used as long as the return period increased the reason behind this might be related to the biased scenarios associated with short return periods which required ensemble algorithms to yield accurate predictions because only a few nodes in the catchment were flooded overall the comparison between the results achieved using validated stormwater models and classifiers shared a coincidence ratio above 85 in all cases which ensured the suitability of machine learning to assess flooding in sewer networks although this fit was slightly weaker than that provided by a multiple regression framework learning classifiers yielded more conservative results which is of interest in a context of changing climate and increased urbanisation the classification algorithms used in this investigation belong to the broader concept of machine learning which is being increasingly adopted in different sectors to facilitate decision making from the training of datasets since machine learning can be used to address a variety of data for different purposes such as estimating air quality traffic or the urban heat island effect its application to model flooding in sewer networks provides an opportunity to homogenise the methods employed to design integrated planning strategies in a context of climate change and urban sprawl moreover the use of learning classifiers permits to avoid resorting to specialised stormwater computer programs which are time consuming and complex in terms of parameterisation future lines of action to give continuity to this research should concern the extrapolation of the proposed methodology to different climate regimes and catchments with other characteristics in terms of size imperviousness and sewer network coverage in order to guarantee the accuracy of learning classifiers in a variety of contexts declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper

methodology concerned the examination of the variability among the predictors proposed in order to try summarising most of the information included in them into broader groups or factors this process was accomplished through the use of factor analysis spearman 1904 whose purpose is to reduce a large number of variables into a smaller set of latent factors that are easier to interpret harman 1976 factor analysis is therefore a statistical technique to reduce data dimensionality eq 1 formulates its mathematical representation where x is the n vector of variables or predictors μ is the n vector of means l is a n m matrix of loadings f is a m vector of common factors and ε is a n vector of residuals 1 x μ l f ε the extraction method selected to estimate the factor loadings was principal components since this approach implies no distributional assumption and is also less susceptible than other alternatives e g maximum likelihood to yield solutions that fail to converge fabrigar et al 1999 when using this method l is expressed as indicated in eq 2 2 l λ 1 e 1 λ 2 e 2 λ m e m where λ i and e i i 1 m represent the eigenvalues and eigenvectors associated with the factors the eigenvalues were also used to produce a scree plot which represents them in descending order versus the factor number this plot can be divided into three differentiated parts including a very steep curve a bend and finally a flat area according to kaiser s rule the number of factors in which to reduce the initial variables correspond to those whose eigenvalue is greater than 1 kaiser 1960 to facilitate the interpretation of the factor loadings they were transformed using the varimax method which is the most widely used option for orthogonal rotation fabrigar et al 1999 it seeks to make the loadings either large or small by maximising the variance of their squared values within the factors kaiser 1958 the sums of the squared loadings result in the communalities which represent the variability explained by the factors overall the proportion of variance v a r explained by each j th factor is determined according to its eigenvalue λ j and the trace of the correlation matrix tr r as specified in eq 3 3 v a r λ j tr r although the common application of factor analysis usually aims at reducing a greater number of variables to a smaller set to facilitate their interpretation rummel 1988 its underlying purpose is completely aligned with the objectives of this research since it seeks to understand what constructs underlie the data used as inputs in other words this analysis served to reduce the list of predictors presented in table 1 to a few factors thereby enabling the determination of the variables that were strictly necessary to model urban flooding based on their correlation with the condition of the nodes flooded or non flooded in sewer networks 2 2 correlation analysis once the predictors were arranged according to the percent of variance explained next was the selection of those variables achieving the highest loadings in the factors formed this enabled measuring their degree of association with the situation of the nodes in sewer networks in terms of flooding hence this step sought to explore the relationships between continuous variables represented by the predictors compiled in table 1 and the dichotomous variable provided by the absence 0 or presence 1 of floods in sewer networks consequently these relationships were modelled using the point biserial correlation coefficient γ p b which is the appropriate measure to apply when dealing with this combination of variables the formulation of γ p b which is provided in eq 4 sheskin 2003 assumes that the dichotomous variable is divided into two groups namely η 0 and η 1 in this context these terms corresponded to non flooded 0 and flooded 1 nodes respectively accordingly υ 0 and υ 1 are the mean values of the continuous variables for the nodes included in η 0 and η 1 whilst s η stands for the standard deviation of the υ values in the total sample size eq 5 denoted as η η 0 η 1 4 γ p b υ 1 υ 0 s η η 1 η 0 η η 1 5 s η υ 2 υ 2 η η 1 whilst the strength of the relationships between the continuous and dichotomous variables was measured from 1 to 1 according to the values of γ p b obtained from eq 4 their validity was checked by comparing their p values to the significance level α which was set at 0 05 fisher 1925 if the p value is larger than α there is not enough evidence to prove the existence of a linear relationship between the variables and vice versa in case the p value is smaller than α the values of γ p b achieved by those predictors that previously reached high loadings in factor analysis were taken as an indicator for building the predictive models intended to simulate urban floods using learning classifier systems this course of action prevented issues of overfitting in the last step of the methodology due to the inclusion of an excessive amount of predictors thereby leading to obtain concise models based on significant inputs 2 3 learning classification the information produced in previous steps was used to model urban floods through supervised learning classification a branch of machine learning where an algorithm gets insight into how to address new observations based on the experience gained by training data referred to the relationships between inputs and outputs huang et al 2002 in the context of urban flooding the outputs were available in a binary form 0 non flooded nodes and 1 flooded nodes hence learning classifiers were used to model the relationships between these two categories and the statistically significant predictors identified through factor and correlation analyses overall four different groups of classification learners were considered to undertake this task decision trees support vector machines k nearest neighbour classifiers and ensemble classifiers table 2 provides a summary of the main features of the algorithms corresponding to the four groups tested the values of speed and memory usage were obtained by testing several datasets amounting to up to 7000 observations 80 predictors and 50 classes the mathworks 2018 although these figures might change depending on the capabilities of the machines used they are useful in providing a comparison among the computing demands associated with each method regarding flexibility this parameter concerns the tendency of the algorithms to account for negligible variations that may lead to overfitting the models decision trees are formed of nodes branches and leaves hence they work as an iterative breakdown technique that starting from a dependent variable or response in the form of class leaf node produces groups defined by combinations of the values branches of independent variables or predictors root nodes including all the observations in the sample hastie et al 2009 the tree is usually pruned in subsequent steps to prevent overfitting issues since this approach is rather sensitive to this phenomenon support vector machines work as a linear classifier that separates data into two groups by identifying an ideal hyperplane maximising the distance between the support vectors which represent the closest points between categories vapnik 1995 the remaining data points are not taken into account to determine this hyperplane hence the points labelled with one of the classes stay at one side of the hyperplane and vice versa for the others unlike decision trees support vector machines do not tend to overfit data the k nearest neighbour algorithm is a lazy learning method based on instances such that new instances needing to be classified are compared with previous examples through a metric distance mitchell 1997 thus the k nearest instances previously considered are used to determine which class should be allocated to the new query instance for instance if k 3 and these neighbours are distributed in a ratio of 2 1 the algorithm assigns the new instance to the class containing two points ensemble classifiers emerged to improve the performance of individual classifiers by combining them and maximising their separate strengths kittler et al 1998 this helps reduce some of the main causes for poor fitting such as variance and bias there are different approaches to conduct this merger depending on whether estimations are built independently breiman 1996 or sequentially freund and schapire 1996 the former might be the best option if the issue with individual classifiers is overfitting whereas the latter may provide better results in terms of bias the accuracy of these classifiers was tested through cross validation this approach is based on partitioning the dataset into a number of folds such that the following steps are applied for 1 train a model for each fold using the observations not contained in them 2 evaluate the performance of the models from the data included in their corresponding folds and 3 determine the mean error of the test taking into account all the folds unlike holdout validation which divides the whole dataset into two different subsets for training and testing purposes this method is recommended for small samples because it uses all the observations for training bengio and grandvalet 2004 given the common size of urban catchments and the number of nodes in them that may perform as observations cross validation was the method chosen for testing the accuracy of the algorithms listed in table 2 to classify between flooded and non flooded cases 3 results and discussion the results of this investigation stemmed from the application of the proposed methodology to an urban catchment situated in espoo southern finland as a graphical summary of the variables considered in table 1 fig 2 represents the distribution of the nodes 75 and conduits 80 forming the sewer network in the study area which was divided into a series of subcatchments 79 characterised by their slope and average percentage of imperviousness the delineation of the catchment as well as the calculation of the slope and degree of imperviousness in its subcatchments were determined with the support of geographic information systems gis jato espino et al 2017 the hydrological response of the study catchment depicted in fig 2 was calibrated and validated by jato espino et al 2017 through the simulation of 6 real storms monitored during 2006 using the storm water management model swmm then the effects of climate change on the catchment were assessed by simulating a set of synthetic storms designed using the alternating block method jato espino et al 2017 these synthetic rainfall events corresponded to different return periods t and the representative concentration pathway rcp 8 5 w m2 which is the most unfavourable climate change scenario and represents a continuous rise in radiative forcing during the 21st century van vuuren et al 2011 table 3 indicates the duration and depth of all these storms real and synthetic in the case of the real storms the goodness of fit measures obtained for the simulation of the outflow in the catchment using swmm are provided too in the form of root sum squared error rsse coefficient of determination r 2 and nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient e finally table 3 also shows the number of flooded nodes determined when modelling the rcp8 5 synthetic storms with both swmm jato espino et al 2017 and multiple regression analysis mra jato espino et al 2018 these synthetic storms were built using the alternating block method from intensity duration frequency idf curves jato espino et al 2017 for the sake of comparison the mra based results were dichotomised since they were expressed as flooding probability in the original investigation therefore values of 0 and 1 were assigned to probabilities below and above 50 respectively hence the results stemming from this investigation concerned the modelling of node flooding in the study catchment fig 2 when simulating a variety of storms table 3 using a combination of factor and correlation analyses with learning classifier systems in order to compare the results achieved with those obtained with swmm and mra consistent with the approach taken to describe the methodology the results are presented sequentially according to the three components forming it 3 1 factor analysis the application of the proposed methodology started with the generation of the scree plot depicted in fig 3 which shows the eigenvalues corresponding to the list of predictors included in table 1 the horizontal line drawn to cross the value of 1 in the vertical axis kaiser 1960 coincided with the bend of the plot suggesting that the number of factors into which the initial set of 14 predictors should be divided was 5 once the number of factors was determined factor analysis was applied using principal components as method of extraction and varimax as type of rotation the main results yielded by the test are compiled in table 4 including the values of rotated factor loadings communality and variance expressed both as a decimal and as a percentage overall the values of communality achieved pointed out to the diameter of the immediately preceding p 10 and subsequent p 11 conduits to the nodes as the variables that were best explained by the factors followed by subcatchment area p 1 average preceding diameter of conduits p 9 and subsequent length of conduit p 8 in accordance with the values of communality the rotated loadings corresponding to the first factor which explained most than a quarter of the total variance represented the geometric characteristics of the conduits especially in what concerns their diameter p 9 p 10 and p 11 in contrast the second most explanatory factor concerned the geometry of subcatchments in terms of their area p 1 and width p 3 such that the two most relevant factors represented the two groups into which the predictors were divided table 1 the logic behind factor 3 was not so evident since it allocated the highest loadings to subcatchment imperviousness p 2 and subsequent length of conduits p 8 the relationship between these two variables lied on the capacity of the nodes linking both elements on the one hand highly impervious subcatchments contribute to increasing the volume and velocity of runoff and therefore the amount of water captured by the nodes on the other hand the length of subsequent conduits enable conveying large and rapidly accumulated runoff thereby preventing the existence of floods in the nodes factors 4 and 5 mainly involved the slope of subcatchments p 4 and conduits p 12 p 13 and p 14 as well as the depth of the nodes p 5 forming sewer networks the association of the latter with the slope related variables was coherent since the inclination requirements of the conduits to avoid either sedimentation or erosion issues limit the invert elevation of the nodes these two factors explained 12 3 and 10 4 of the variability in the data contributing to achieve an overall value of v a r of 76 4 the information derived from the factors summarised in table 4 served to support the correlation analysis conducted in the next step the rotated loadings stemming from the application of factor analysis indicated which predictors provided greater insight into the percentage of variability explained in each group suggesting which combinations of predictors should be examined in terms of their relationship to the occurrence of floods in sewer networks 3 2 correlation analysis in parallel with the application of factor analysis the degree of association between the values of the variables contained in table 1 and flood presence in the nodes was modelled with the support of correlation analysis table 5 since the flood related results obtained through the application of swmm were those stemming from simulations validated with real data jato espino et al 2017 they were used as a baseline for implementing the proposed approach given the nature of the predictors continuous and the response binary this step was approached through the point biserial correlation coefficient γ p b as formulated in eq 4 these results highlighted two main aspects having a positive and significant p values 0 05 correlation with the occurrence of urban floods subcatchment area p 1 and the geometric features of conduits diameter especially p 10 and length p 6 and p 7 the relationship of the size of subcatchments to flooding was evident since large contributing areas facilitate runoff accumulation and therefore the amount of water received by the nodes regarding the characteristics of the conduits the positive correlation between their diameter and lengths and flooding pointed out to the design criteria of urban drainage systems despite the dimensions of these elements are projected to be greater at the locations where runoff is expected to accumulate flooding hotspots remain in critical areas due to their flatness and high degree of imperviousness which hinder the capture of water based on the factors and correlation coefficients collected in tables 4 and 5 respectively a list of combinations of predictors were proposed to perform as inputs in the application of learning classifiers as a result table 6 summarises the minimum number of variables to consider in the modelling of urban floods with the limitation of using no more than one statistically significant predictor per factor overall this cross selection process revealed that urban floods may be essentially explained through four main aspects such that at least three of them were found to be relevant under every return period preceding diameter of conduit p 10 subcatchment area p 1 preceding length of conduit p 7 and node invert elevation p 5 these results highlighted by their representativeness since all the physical elements involved in the modelling of urban floods subcatchments conduits and nodes were epitomised by at least one variable in principle the variables included in table 6 were the predictors used to model urban flooding through learning classifiers however in those cases in which this initial selection was not sufficient to yield satisfactory estimates the inclusion of additional predictors according to the results of both tables 4 and 5 was examined to increase the accuracy of the predictions made 3 3 learning classification the use of learning classifiers from the combinations of predictors proposed in table 6 was preceded by the determination of the number of folds or divisions into which partition the observations available at the study area since the sample size the number of nodes was small the number of folds was established at 10 to avoid an increase in variance favoured by the instability of forming larger training sets kohavi 1995 the results stemming from testing the accuracy of the learning classifiers summarised in table 2 highlighted the suitability of the algorithms collected in table 7 to classify the number of total non flooded 0 flooded 1 nodes identified with swmm for the climate scenarios considered the combinations of predictors proposed in table 6 were valid to yield accurate estimates under all return periods except t 50 yr hence p 6 was incorporated into the model since this was the remaining statistically significant predictor for this scenario table 5 and was also found to be relevant in several factors table 4 as a result the classification associated with this scenario improved considerably the average values of prediction accuracy in table 7 proved the difficulties to classify the nodes in the category 1 under shorter return periods which increased proportionally to the number of flooded nodes in the datasets this correspondence between learning classifiers and climate scenarios revealed a decrease in the complexity of the algorithms as long as the return periods increased this might be related to the distribution of non flooded and flooded nodes for the storms considered since this ratio was markedly biased for short return periods the fact that the number of problematic nodes was very reduced in these cases could hinder reaching satisfactory predictions whilst the accuracy increased for more intense storms due to their better balance between flooded and non flooded nodes the complete performance of these classifiers is depicted in fig 4 which specifies the ratio of nodes correctly true positive rate and incorrectly false positive rate allocated to the flooded and non flooded categories identified using the validated models obtained with swmm the number of iterations run to classify the datasets under the different return periods was 50 since there was a strong convergence of results once this figure was reached as a proof of this evidence the average prediction accuracy achieved after 40 and 50 trials only differed 0 25 from each other with the maximum disparities corresponding to the flooded nodes for the t 5 yr storm 1 51 the values of prediction accuracy stemming from the classifications shown in fig 4 were examined through an outlier analysis the box plot chart represented in fig 5 revealed the presence of some outliers in the estimates related to all return periods the distribution of these outliers was uneven but they never were above 4 for any scenario which means 2 67 out of the whole sample of values 150 trials broken down into total non flooded and flooded nodes to further analyse the accuracy of the proposed methodology the classifications provided by the models schematised in table 7 were mapped and compared with those achieved with mra in order to evaluate them against the approach taken as a baseline swmm fig 6 shows the similarity between these three alternatives for the 5 yr and 25 yr return periods according to these maps 87 80 and 85 37 of the nodes in the study catchment conserved the same classification when using learning classifier systems respectively although these figures increased to 95 12 and 87 80 in the case of mra machine learning emerged as a more conservative option due to its slight overestimation of the number of flooded nodes in the catchment which might be desirable in a context of climate change and urbanisation besides the proposed methodology remained as a simpler alternative in terms of implementation since the mra framework used as a benchmark requires the combination of up to three different types of regression models linear nonlinear and logistic therefore these results demonstrated its validity and convenience to determine flooding in sewer networks and replicate the outputs achieved through the use of physical stormwater software and statistical approaches which represent the most widely used means to model urban drainage systems 4 conclusions this research designed tested and validated a methodology to model flooding in sewer networks from the combination of learning classification systems with factor and correlation analyses the latter two components sought to minimise the number of variables required to perform as inputs in the application of learning classifiers thereby simplifying the interpretation of results and reducing the computational costs demanded by the algorithms these classification algorithms provide an alternative approach to model urban floods by grouping the nodes forming sewer networks according to their susceptibility to reach their full capacity the results obtained highlighted the benefits provided by the coupling of factor and correlation analysis to facilitate the choice of the minimum amount of predictors required to model floods in sewer networks using learning classifiers on average only four variables were identified as necessary to classify flooded and non flooded nodes in the catchment used as a case study under four return periods with different intensities after testing 20 different algorithms the fits achieved suggested a decrease in the complexity of the classifiers used as long as the return period increased the reason behind this might be related to the biased scenarios associated with short return periods which required ensemble algorithms to yield accurate predictions because only a few nodes in the catchment were flooded overall the comparison between the results achieved using validated stormwater models and classifiers shared a coincidence ratio above 85 in all cases which ensured the suitability of machine learning to assess flooding in sewer networks although this fit was slightly weaker than that provided by a multiple regression framework learning classifiers yielded more conservative results which is of interest in a context of changing climate and increased urbanisation the classification algorithms used in this investigation belong to the broader concept of machine learning which is being increasingly adopted in different sectors to facilitate decision making from the training of datasets since machine learning can be used to address a variety of data for different purposes such as estimating air quality traffic or the urban heat island effect its application to model flooding in sewer networks provides an opportunity to homogenise the methods employed to design integrated planning strategies in a context of climate change and urban sprawl moreover the use of learning classifiers permits to avoid resorting to specialised stormwater computer programs which are time consuming and complex in terms of parameterisation future lines of action to give continuity to this research should concern the extrapolation of the proposed methodology to different climate regimes and catchments with other characteristics in terms of size imperviousness and sewer network coverage in order to guarantee the accuracy of learning classifiers in a variety of contexts declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
6106,reliable estimation of sediment transport capacity is essential for soil erosion modeling the objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of twelve widely used transport capacity functions with a wide range of hydraulic conditions and soil properties the comparisons with observed data indicated that none of the selected twelve functions gave satisfactory results for transport capacity prediction over all overland flow datasets in this study and all of them gave very poor predictions for loess soil therefore a new equation was developed for sediment transport capacity estimation among these twelve functions the ali equation gave the best fit for the whole dataset but calibration was necessary when using it for large sediment grains 2 mm or loess soil the yalin equation and the simplified yalin equation worked better for soils than sands and predictions for smaller sands 0 2 mm were acceptable the govers equation had relatively uniform performance for all datasets the performance of empirical equations changed dramatically for different datasets a new function developed in this study was generated based on dimensional analysis and gave good predictions within the range of hydraulic conditions and particle sizes in the datasets considered in this study the results provide a summary of the transport capacity functions evaluated and suggest an improved function for modeling overland flow sediment transport capacity keywords sediment transport capacity overland flow hydraulic condition sediment particles 1 introduction soil erosion is a serious problem worldwide which causes problems such as decreased soil fertility degraded water quality and reduced reservoir storage the soil erosion process embodies the subprocesses of sediment detachment transport and deposition caused by the impacts of rainfall and runoff over the soil surface foster 1982 and these three subprocesses are correlated with each other the detachment transport coupling concept is the most widely used concept for combining these three subprocesses and it is the basis of the wepp water erosion prediction project flanagan et al 2001 the eurosem european soil erosion model morgan et al 1998 the lisem limburg soil erosion model de roo et al 1996 and the kineros2 kinematic wave overland flow channel routing and erosion model smith et al 1995 models in this concept transport capacity is the equilibrium sediment concentration approached at an infinite downslope distance given that hydraulic conditions discharge channel roughness slope etc do not change polyakov and nearing 2003 as assumed in this concept detachment rate could be calculated based on the deficit of transport capacity and net deposition occurs when sediment load in the flow exceeds transport capacity thus a reliable prediction of transport capacity is essential for all three subprocesses in soil erosion modeling two different scales are widely used for soil erosion modeling including predictions for hillslopes and watersheds hillslopes are used as the basic estimation areas where soil erodes and sediment loss accumulates which is a combination of contributions from rills and interrill areas since a distinct change of erosion rates is caused by rill development the rill channels are considered as an important component for sediment detachment and deposition and a major area for sediment transport therefore the estimation of sediment transport capacities in rills is discussed in this study which is under overland flow conditions given the significance of transport capacity estimation extensive studies have been conducted regarding better predictions by creating new equations modifying previous equations or evaluating performance of different equations based on the analysis of bed particle movement in channels einstein 1942 established an equation to calculate bed load transport and assumed that the critical tractive force does not exist and the grain motion is caused by turbulent fluctuation in yalin s study yalin 1963 a bed load sediment transport formula was generated on the basis of the existing critical tractive force which could be obtained from shields curve by analysis of saltating particles the yalin equation was derived under steady state conditions on a movable cohesionless bed with equal size grains instead of tractive force analysis a transport function was developed in yang s study 1973 based on the energy cost for incipient motion of particles he suggested the use of unit stream power rather than shear stress for sediment transport prediction rose et al 1983 created a new mathematical model for soil erosion estimation and the sediment concentration at the transport limit could be calculated using an effective stream power other than the theoretical analysis of particle movement the results of govers 1990 showed the possibility to predict sediment transport capacity using empirical relationships various empirical functions with different predictors have been developed under limited experimental conditions everaert 1991 zhang et al 2009 wang et al 2015 wu et al 2016 given the requirements to reduce computational time for utilizing the yalin equation for calculation foster 1987 a simplified yalin equation was developed for transport capacity calculation for use in the wepp model finkner et al 1989 the simplified equation provided closed form solutions for steady state conditions and reduced computational time in the ali et al 2013 study a new transport capacity equation was derived by adopting the same basic variables in the yang 1973 equation however the hydraulic conditions are different when applying these two functions the yang 1973 equation is for stream flow conditions and the ali 2013 equation is for overland flow conditions in the study of alonso et al 1981 nine sediment transport capacity functions were selected for evaluation using sets of measured data the yalin equation gave the best predictions for overland flow and the yang equation and the laursen equation performed better than the others for stream flow prediction in the range of fine to coarse sands and very fine sands to silts respectively however contradictory results were obtained from govers 1992 study which also evaluated the performance of several formulas including the yalin equation and he found that no one equation yielded good predictions over the whole range of overland flow conditions tested in his study and it was suggested that the former evaluations with promising results may have been due to the limited range of experimental conditions nord and esteves 2007 compared several sediment transport capacity functions by using the rill erosion databases of psem 2d and wepp they found that the govers 1990 equation which is based on unit stream power gave the best results for cohesive particles and the yalin 1963 equation the low 1989 equation and the govers 1990 equation did not perform well for cohesionless particles however in the study of ali et al 2013 the yalin equation and the low equation exhibited good agreement for sands and the govers equation was less accurate but provided similar accuracies for the entire range of sands to date extensive transport capacity formulas with different parameters were created or modified using various field or experimental databases even though some functions are widely used in soil erosion models their evaluation is inconsistent given the lack of data which adds to the difficulties for selecting appropriate functions the performance of each transport capacity function may differ for stream flow and overland flow conditions cohesive and non cohesive particles and different ranges of slope steepness given the shallow flow depth for overland flow conditions the continuously changing roughness tension may affect the flow characteristics foster and meyer 1972 also raindrop impacts would be more significant under shallower overland flow conditions in the research of beuselinck et al 2002 a water discharge threshold exists for a given hydraulic condition that within this threshold the previously deposited sediment particles are lifted into the water layer according to the raindrop impact the slope gradients are mostly steeper for overland flow compared with stream flow and poor predictions of transport capacity indicated that functions generated under flat slope conditions may not be appropriate for steep study areas govers 1992 these differences cause uncertainty as to whether the functions developed for stream flow could be used for overland flow sediment transport estimation however the observations of concentrated overland flow in rills provide some important similarities between stream flow and overland flow characteristics given the important role of rills to transport sediment from hillslopes to the hydrographic network some models e g wepp assume that interrill erosion is a process of sediment delivery to concentrated flow channels or rills and the sediment transport is calculated on a unit rill width basis therefore the possibility of applying stream flow equations on overland flow conditions exists in the study of alonso et al 1981 nine sediment transport formulas were considered and all of them were originally developed based upon stream flow conditions alonso et al 1981 used overland flow and sediment discharge data and their results showed that the yalin equation estimated sediment transport capacity well and it provided the possibility to utilize fluvial equations for overland transport prediction the observations of kilinc and richardson s 1973 study also reported that some bedload fluvial transport equations for channels could be applied as overland flow equations but calibration of parameters was required for the study area moreover foster and meyer s 1972 observations indicated that only bedload formulas for stream flow could be considered for overland flow evaluation and suspended load could be neglected the reason for the good performance of bedload equations was probably caused by the similar ways of sediment transport in channels and rills rolling sliding and saltation ali et al 2013 vast datasets have been used for sediment transport study on various beds with different sediment particles including cohesive soils and non cohesive sands considering the cohesion between particles more energy would be expended for cohesive particle detachment from the soil surface compared to non cohesive particles also it is recognized that cohesive sediments with lower settling velocities typically move over a relatively larger horizontal distance the differences between cohesive and non cohesive particle erosion challenge the application of a single function for both conditions however the study of foster and meyer 1972 observed that once aggregates were detached from cohesive soils their transport could be assumed as the same as that of non cohesive grains according to the study of proffitt et al 1991 the fraction of the soil surface covered by the deposited layer was about 90 this idea of large areas covered by cohesionless deposited particles provides the possibility to apply formulas generated from cohesionless sands for naturally cohesive soil sediment transport capacity prediction based on the same idea hairsine and rose 1992 gave the definition of transport capacity as the equilibrium sediment concentration when the whole surface was covered by the deposited non cohesive layer even though differences in settling velocities were observed between cohesive and non cohesive particles this settling velocity variable is included in many widely used transport capacity equations yang 1973 abrahams et al 2001 ali et al 2013 which could reduce the influence of particle cohesion given the different characteristics between different kinds of soils the utilization is questionable for one soil based or sand based function on another soil especially for loess soils which have a high percentage of silt causing very high erodibility the results of wu et al 2018 observed that the predicted sediment transport capacities in the lisem limburg soil erosion model increased by 62 compared to the measured values for loess soils so the application of the lisem in loess areas is uncertain in the study of wang et al 2015 the underestimation of transport capacities was obvious and cannot be ignored when using the wepp for loess soil erosion estimation given the great disparities among different kinds of study particles the consideration of soil characteristics is necessary for equation selection and sediment transport capacity estimation as a major factor for sediment transport capacity prediction slope steepness was considered in every function either as an individual factor or in other parameters e g shear stress unit stream power or stream power the proper slope ranges for the application of each equation were limited by their supporting database due to the mostly flat slope conditions of stream flow all previous fluvial transport capacity functions were generated with lower slope gradients and a similar relationship was assumed when using these functions in steep areas however the study of smart 1984 obtained different performances of the meyer peter and mueller 1948 equation for different slope ranges the meyer peter mueller equation was created on slopes from 0 04 to 2 and seriously underestimated the sediment transport rates on slopes steeper than 3 moreover the observations of lei et al 2001 showed that the transport capacities changed inconsistently for slopes less than 20 and greater than 20 with the same unit flow discharge so that 20 could be a critical slope for loess soil erosion experiments the inconsistent performances of one formula for different slope ranges indicates the reason to consider slope ranges for equation selection for the existing studies on the basis of either theoretical analysis or empirical relationships different parameters are used for transport capacity estimation shear stress unit stream power and stream power shear stress is defined as the force per unit wetted area that acts on a surface and it is calculated as yalin 1963 1 τ ρ w g h s where τ is the shear stress n m 2 ρw is the density of water kg m 3 g is the acceleration due to gravity m s 2 h is mean flow depth m and s is the slope gradient m m 1 based on the theory that movement of soil particles is caused by the drag and lift forces of flowing water the shear tress τ was used to control incipient motions of particles by analyzing the tractive forces for particles a critical value of shear stress τcr was considered in some studies yalin 1963 abrahams et al 2001 and must be exceeded before the particles begin to move in the studies involving empirical equations roberts et al 2003 zhang et al 2009 a strong correlation between transport capacities and shear stress was obtained similar to the shear stress parameter some equations engelund and hansen 1967 ackers and white 1973 low 1989 were developed using the shear velocity u for transport capacity calculation since bagnold 1966 emphasized the rate of energy expenditure rather than the forces applied to the bed yang 1973 defined unit stream power for prediction in terms of the power per unit weight of water and it is calculated as follows 2 p v s where p is the unit stream power m s 1 and v is average flow velocity m s 1 in the studies of yang 1973 govers 1990 and ali et al 2013 the critical unit stream power pcr at incipient motion was introduced for calculation but different approaches were identified in these studies for critical unit stream power computation the results of yang et al 2018 indicated that sediment transport was well predicted by unit stream power compared to shear stress or stream power the stream power is calculated as bagnold 1966 3 ω τ v ρ w g s q where ω is the stream power w m 2 and q is the overland flow discharge per unit width m2 s 1 the observations of abrahams et al 2001 indicated that 89 9 of the variance in transport capacity in their study could be explained by effective stream power ω ωc after evaluating the calculated sediment transport capacities using the guest griffith university erosion system template rose et al 1983 and the wepp mahmoodabadi et al 2014 observed that both models tended to under estimate transport capacity and stream power is a better predictor than shear stress the results of asadi et al 2011 indicated that the sediment transport mechanisms suspension saltation and rolling were related to stream power and soil type given the uncertainty of selecting functions for different overland flow conditions it is necessary to evaluate the performance of the widely recommended sediment transport capacity functions and to identify the suitability of these functions for each condition the purpose of this study is 1 to summarize the application ranges of selected transport capacity functions and 2 to generate a new sediment transport capacity function using data from a wide range of hydraulic conditions and particle sizes for overland flow estimation 2 selected transport capacity functions most existing transport capacity formulas were generated from theoretical analyses or empirical relationships and the theoretical analyses were mostly about tractive forces or energy expenditure for sediment movement according to the categories in table 1 the widely used functions in the asterisked studies for each category were selected for evaluation in this study in selecting formulas 1 the functions should be widely applied for sediment transport capacity estimation 2 equations from both theoretical and empirical analyses should be evaluated and 3 assessments of equations using shear stress unit stream power and stream power are required 1 yalin 1963 equation based on the analysis of tractive forces for sediment particles an equation was generated for bed load sediment transport in yalin s 1963 study critical shear stress was selected to determine the incipient motion of particles in this study and it was estimated using the shields curve the yalin equation was designed to calculate sediment transport capacity for turbulent flow 4a t c ρ w 0 5

this reason no rainfall variable was included in this equation 8 guest equation rose et al 1983 in this model the ground surface was covered by either the original soil particles or the deposited layers a factor h was defined as the fraction of the surface covered by the deposited sediment then the sediment concentration at the transport limit could be obtained when h 1 which means the least

which transport capacity increased as a power function with increasing shear stress but the exponential value for shear stress was 1 982 which was much greater than the wepp exponent of 1 5 3 materials and methods the data used in this study for formula evaluations were from available literature and consisted of 529 flume experiments including 318 runs on sands 144 runs on cropland soils and 67 runs on loess soils the median particle sizes for all sand datasets and the particle size distributions for all soil datasets were available and used in the analysis the data are summarized in table 2 in this study the functions in the wepp model were used to calculate critical shear stress for the datasets without measured values and the equations without calculation methods for critical

sand particles for soil datasets the size distributions were used to calculate settling velocities for sand datasets median sizes were used to represent the particle sizes for settling velocity calculation since the relatively uniform size of sands all of the selected formulas were used to compute sediment transport capacity equation performance was evaluated using graphical figures and the

observations in which the discrepancy ratio falls between 0 5 and 2 0 and n is the total number of observations 4 results and discussion 4 1 evaluation for selected transport capacity functions 4 1 1 function performance for cohesionless particles there were 318 runs with cohesionless particles used for this evaluation the experiments of smart 1984 were designed for steep channels with deep water flows and large particles which were close to stream flow conditions compared with the other datasets the studies of both aziz and scott 1989 and ali et al 2012 used sands with similar sizes from 0 2 mm to 1 0 mm but the study of ali et al 2012 was based on relatively shallow flows the datasets from zhang et al 2009 were obtained from a wide range of slopes including very steep gradients fig 1 shows the comparison between predicted and observed transport capacities for cohesionless particles using the functions tested for these cohesionless particles the yalin equation and the simplified yalin equation typically overestimated results for sand sizes considered but gave acceptable predictions for small sands 0 285 mm 0 230 mm and 0 280 mm there were large discrepancies between measured and predicted values for measured transport capacities over 10 0 kg m 1 s 1 for the yalin equation and the simplified yalin equation the values of p o 0 5 2 0 for the finest particles 0 230 mm 0 280 and 0 285 mm were around or over 50 and reached 98 44 and 93 75 for 0 280 mm sands based on the zhang et al 2009 dataset table 3 however the discrepancy ratio values between 0 5 and 2 0 were zero for most other datasets smart 1984 aziz and scott 1989 when cohesionless particle size was greater than 0 3 mm these results partially agreed with those reported by ali et al 2013 who found the accuracies of the yalin equation gradually decreased with increases in grain size but the p o 0 5 2 0 value was greater than 50 for coarse sands 0 50 1 00 mm a possible reason for the differences is that critical shear stress measured in the experiments may have been different from the critical shear stress values calculated in this study using the function for sandy soils from the wepp model therefore it is reasonable for the yalin equation and the simplified yalin equation to predict sediment transport capacities for cohesionless particles smaller than 0 3 mm but the equations are questionable for particle sizes over 0 3 mm the ali equation gave the best fit for cohesionless particles ranging from 0 230 to 1 022 mm fig 1 and the value of p o 0 5 2 0 was 64 15 considering all datasets table 3 one possible reason for these results is that the ali equation was derived from the ali dataset using 0 23 mm to 1 022 mm sands and it showed good performance for the sands within the same size range 0 2 1 0 mm as expected however for very coarse particles 2 0 mm the ali equation underestimated the transport capacities and the calculated p o 0 5 2 0 values were less than 40 and even zero for some particle sizes 2 0 mm and 4 3 mm the results of the ali equation showed that it can accurately estimate the sediment transport capacities for most sands 2 0 mm but calibration is necessary for larger grains 2 10 mm broad scatter was shown around the agreement line between predicted and measured transport capacities with similar patterns for all cohesionless particle sizes when using the govers equation fig 1 the calculated values of p o 0 5 2 0 were relatively uniform and the p o 0 5 2 0 value was 41 51 for the overall data the govers equation tended to overestimate transport capacities for measurements less than 1 0 kg m 1 s 1 and underestimate for measurements over 1 0 kg m 1 s 1 similar results were found in the studies of hessel and jetten 2007 and ali et al 2013 that relatively uniform performances were obtained for all cohesionless particles considered when using the govers equation these results showed potential for use of the govers equation to predict transport capacities for overland flow conditions but also indicated the need for equation calibration since most p o 0 5 2 0 values were around 50 the guy equation and the abrahams gao equation worked well in predicting transport capacities for large particles 2 0 mm and the calculated p o 0 5 2 0 values increased as grain size increased the guy equation showed good agreement between predicted and measured values for sediment transport capacities over 1 0 kg m 1 s 1 one possible reason is the use of excess water discharge as the main parameter in the guy equation which is the difference between water discharge and critical water discharge the excess water discharge emphasized the impacts of water discharge and improved the accuracy when evaluating larger flows with greater sediment transport the abrahams gao equation gave dramatically different p o 0 5 2 0 values for similar particle sizes in different datasets aziz and scott 1989 ali et al 2013 and greater p o 0 5 2 0 values were obtained with larger discharges smart 1984 aziz and scott 1989 one possible reason is the abrahams gao equation was generated based on larger discharge experiments including the smart 1984 dataset in this study the engelund hansen equation the abrahams equation and the guest model underestimated sediment transport capacities for the entire cohesionless database calibrations were needed when using these equations to predict transport capacity for cohesionless particles in the guest model a variable f is designed to describe the fraction of the excess stream power effective in re entrainment of sediments and the calibration of the f variable before applying the guest model improves the accuracy of predictions the yang equation gave very poor predictions for cohesionless particles a possible reason is that the method to calculate critical unit stream power given by the yang equation cannot be used for the hydraulic conditions and particles considered in this study no empirical equations performed well for all cohesionless particles considered in this study and their performance changed dramatically when using different datasets 4 1 2 function performance for soils data from 144 experiments on cropland soils were considered for transport capacity evaluation including two types of soil nansene silt loam and amarillo loamy sand the median particle sizes were different for these two soils and the particles were smaller compared with sand particles the govers equation gave the best predicted transport capacities for cropland soils with the lowest scatter in this study fig 2 this function tended to over predict transport capacities for both particles studied nansene and amarillo but most predictions were within the range of half to twice the observations fig 2 thus the values of p o 0 5 2 0 were as great as 94 44 for the nansene soil and 80 56 for the amarillo soil table 4 the over estimation was likely caused by the dataset used for the govers 1990 equation generation which were obtained on bed materials including coarse particles 0 414 mm and 1 098 mm the ali equation the yalin equation and the simplified yalin equation showed good agreement between observed and predicted transport capacities but produced greater scatter compared to the govers function fig 2 the ali equation gave better predictions for nansene soil p o 0 5 2 0 95 83 compared to the predictions for amarillo soil p o 0 5 2 0 59 72 table 4 a possible reason for the inconsistent results is that the ali equation was derived from experiments on sands d50 0 230 mm and calibration was necessary when applying it on cropland soils the yalin equation and the simplified yalin equation gave similar p o 0 5 2 0 values for both cropland soils considered in this study table 4 with the consideration of the results from cohesionless particles the yalin equation and the simplified yalin equation performed better for finer particles d50 0 2 mm and cropland soils some equations performed better for one kind of cropland soil such as the engelund hansen equation the abrahams equation and the guest model fig 2 the guest model produced less scatter compared to the abrahams equation and the engelund hansen equation fig 2 and model calibration was necessary when using the guest model on different cropland soils dramatic differences are evident between the calculated p o 0 5 2 0 values for the two cropland soils in this study when using the abrahams and engelund hansen equations table 4 the poor performance of the abrahams equation agreed with the findings of ali et al 2013 and hessel and jetten 2007 who also obtained unsatisfactory predictions with it and concluded this equation was not suitable for overland flow conditions for the empirical functions considered the beasley huggins equation showed good agreement between observed and predicted transport capacities and the zhang equation ω gave good predictions for the amarillo soil fig 2 the calculated p o 0 5 2 0 values for the beasley huggins equation were greater than 70 for both soils table 4 which indicates the possibility of application of this function for sediment transport capacity predictions on cropland soils the guy equation and the abrahams gao equation gave poor predictions for both soils fig 2 from the results for cohesionless particles these two functions gave improved performance for larger particles which was likely the reason that they cannot be used for fine particles i e cropland soils the yang equation greatly over predicted the sediment transport capacities for the two cropland soils in this study 4 1 3 function performance for loess soils there were 67 loess soil experimental runs used in this study which included water depths ranging from 1 30 to 4 15 mm and average flow velocity ranging from 0 16 to 1 32 m s the wu et al 2018 experiments were designed with deeper runoff and greater water discharges compared with wang et al 2015 the slope gradients in these two studies were steep and similar to the situation in the loess plateau of china no function gave acceptable predictions for the two loess soils in this study fig 3 table 5 the possible reason is the large differences between loess soil and the other two soil particle types cohesionless particles and cropland soils and that the loess soil contains much more silt e g 86 3 silt in the soil in wang et al 2015 the characteristics of the silty soil and the steep slope caused very high erodibility and very serious loess soil erosion problems none of the functions selected in this study were generated based on data from loess soils and thus no function worked well for predicting transport capacity on them the zhang equation was the only one with relatively acceptable results for loess soils with p o 0 5 2 0 values over 50 for both loess datasets however this function gave inconsistent performance with these datasets and thus its use is questionable the evaluation of selected transport capacity functions showed that performance was different on cohesionless particles cropland soils and loess soils most functions only gave reasonable results for the hydraulic and sediment conditions for which they were generated based on the cohesionless particle results the ali equation gave the best fit for most study grain sizes 0 230 1 022 mm but it under predicted transport capacities for large particles d50 2 0 mm the govers equation gave relatively uniform but poor results for cohesionless particles with p o 0 5 2 0 values around 50 the guy equation and the abrahams gao equation worked better for larger cohesionless particles d50 2 0 mm the yalin equation and the simplified yalin equation produced better predictions for smaller cohesionless particles d50 0 2 mm from the cropland soil results the govers equation gave the best agreement between observed and predicted sediment transport capacities the yalin equation and the simplified yalin equation produced good and consistent predictions for the two kinds of cropland soils in this study the ali equation predicted transport capacities well for cropland soils considered in this study but the performances varied substantially for the two particle sizes no functions selected for this study could be used for sediment transport capacity prediction on loess soils since none of them had good and consistent performance this result was likely caused by the very silty characteristics of the loess soils from the previous evaluation none of the selected twelve functions could be used to predict sediment transport capacities for all of the overland flow conditions considered in this study therefore it is necessary to identify the applicability range of the transport capacity function before using it for prediction no distinct findings were observed to show whether shear stress unit stream power or stream power was better for transport capacity prediction hence further analysis is required to select parameters for the generation of a new equation to obtain better predictions for the complete datasets used in this study 4 2 function generation 4 2 1 function development before the selection of variables for the generation of a new equation the data from the 529 available flume runs were used for correlation analysis this database covered a wide range of soil particles slope gradients hydraulic conditions and sediment transport capacities the parameters in the existing transport capacity functions were also included in this correlation analysis as the factors influencing the sediment transport capacity in overland flows these parameters could be categorized as physical and hydraulic properties of the flow q water discharge v average flow velocity h water depth characteristics of sediment particles d50 median size w50 settling velocity for d50 and boundary geometry s slope steepness the main parameters are shear stress τ unit stream power p and stream power ω and the determination of the sediment incipient motion was based on the critical values of these main parameters in order to select the variables for the new equation development the following constraints had to be taken into account a the parameters should have a high correlation with measured sediment transport capacity b the parameters should be easy to obtain in the field or laboratory so that the new equation could be readily applied c the data should be explained in the simplest way possible and redundant parameters removed and d the parameters should not be highly correlated with each other the correlations between all parameters considered and measured sediment transport capacity are shown in table 6 based on the listed constraints the hydraulic parameters q and h and the particle characteristic parameter w were selected according to the correlation between the three main parameters and measured sediment transport capacity the shear stress and the stream power and their corresponding excess values gave almost equal and high correlation values considering the application of the new equation excess flow shear stress was selected for prediction since more studies exist to estimate critical shear stress as the amount of energy dissipated per unit of time and per unit of bed surface stream power ω was also selected for predicting transport capacity besides the selected parameters based on correlation analysis other fundamental factors were also included for the new equation generation g gravitational acceleration ρs sediment density and ρw water density after the selection of variables the transport capacity could be expressed as follows 25 t c f q h w τ τ c ω ρ s ρ w g in eq 25 the fundamental factors ρw and g are constants for a given environment in the buckingham pi theorem in dimensional analysis the number of repeating variables should be selected according to the dimensions given three dimensions mass length and time in eq 25 the sediment density ρs the water depth h and the settling velocity w were considered repeating variables which contained all three dimensions and they were used to generate the pi groups in the buckingham pi theorem after forcing pi to be dimensionless eq 25 becomes 26a t c ρ s q f q wh τ τ c ρ s ρ w g h ω w ρ s ρ w g h ρ s ρ w ρ s thus the dimensionless transport capacity t c ρ s q could be written as 26b t c ρ s q a q wh b τ τ c ρ s ρ w g h c ω w ρ s ρ w g h d ρ s ρ w ρ s e where a b c d e are constant coefficients from the total of 529 available experimental data about three quarters 397 runs were selected as the database for equation generation and the remaining 132 runs were selected for validation the selection of the data was random and both the generation database and the validation database contained experimental data from every dataset cohesionless dataset cropland dataset and loess dataset after regression analysis using the generated database equation 26b becomes 27 t c ρ s q 0 195 q wh 0 520 τ τ c ρ s ρ w g h 1 864 ω w ρ s ρ w g h 0 689 ρ s ρ w ρ s 5 918 the previous results indicated that all transport capacity functions considered could not be utilized in loess areas this suggests the possibility that the sediment transport processes may be different for loess soil compared with other soils therefore another equation was created based on the generated database without including the loess soils 331 runs the new alternative equation was 28 t c ρ s q 0 253 q wh 1 391 τ τ c ρ s ρ w g h 2 507 ω w ρ s ρ w g h 1 422 ρ s ρ w ρ s 4 800 when using eq 27 and eq 28 for sediment transport capacity prediction with the particle distribution data the settling velocity w is for the corresponding particle size class the transport capacity would be calculated for each particle size class and summed based on the particle size distribution when median value could represent the particle size e g uniform sands the settling velocity w in these two equations is the value for the median particle size w50 4 2 2 validation of new equations as mentioned before data from 132 runs were used for the validation of these two equations eqs 27 and 28 the results for each dataset are shown in table 7 and fig 4 even though eq 28 was created from the database without any data from experiments on loess soils this equation provided acceptable transport capacity predictions for the loess soils since data from only 17 runs on loess soils were included in the validation database the whole loess soil database 67 runs was used for the validation of eq 28 and the results are shown in fig 5 the p o 0 5 2 0 values for wang et al 2015 experiments and wu et al 2018 experiments were 80 00 and 64 29 respectively which means that 80 and 64 of the predictions in the corresponding dataset were within the range of half to twice the observations therefore the selected variables and the form of the equation could be utilized for transport capacity prediction for all particles considered in this study since the generation database for eq 27 contained loess datasets the accuracies of the predictions increased for loess soils compared with the results of eq 28 in table 7 eq 27 was better suited for transport capacity prediction for the validation database compared to eq 28 as shown in table 7 even though eq 28 was created from the database without loess soil data the results showed predictions with greater scatter for cohesionless particles and cropland soils this could be caused due to several reasons first both eqs 27 and 28 could be utilized for transport capacity calculations on loess soil thus it is unnecessary to delete loess soil data as an exception for equation generation second these two equations both gave unsatisfactory results for the ali et al 2012 dataset without the loess soil dataset the impacts of the ali et al dataset in the generation database increased and the performance of eq 28 decreased the performance of eq 27 for each validation dataset is shown in fig 6 observed values that were underestimated and others that were overestimated fell outside the half to twice range when using the ali et al 2012 dataset possible reasons include that the lowest water depths and slowest average velocities were used in the ali et al experiments when the calculated critical shear stress was around the shear stress in these situations the accuracy could be influenced greatly by a slight change of surface roughness second the particles used in ali et al study were pure sands the errors could be caused by the calculation of critical shear stress in this study which was for sandy soil more than 50 sand other than pure sands for the results of other cohesionless datasets aziz and scott 1989 smart 1984 zhang et al 2009 in fig 6 most predictions were slightly overestimated but still within the half to twice range these overestimates could be caused by the calculation of critical shear stress therefore eq 27 would be better for transport capacity prediction compared with eq 28 and could be used for the cohesionless particles cropland soils and loess soils in this study 5 summary and conclusions in this study the application of twelve widely used sediment transport capacity equations was evaluated based on a large range of particles slopes and overland flow hydrologic conditions both graphical and statistical analysis were performed and presented the results indicated that none of the twelve widely used equations gave satisfactory results to estimate transport capacities for the overall datasets in this study and all of them gave very poor predictions for loess soil this implies the necessity to improve transport capacity prediction for wider ranges of data among these twelve functions the ali equation gave the best fit for the whole database but calibration was necessary when using it for large grains d50 2 mm or loess soils the yalin equation and the simplified yalin equation worked better for cropland soils than sands and predictions for smaller sands 0 2 mm were acceptable other than the yalin equation and the simplified yalin equation the guy equation and the abrahams gao equation gave better predictions for larger grains d50 2 mm and the accuracy of predictions increased as particle size increased the govers equation gave relatively uniform performances for all datasets the yang equation performed poorly when predicting transport capacity for the entire database in this study the performance of empirical equations changed dramatically for different datasets to improve the accuracy of sediment transport capacity calculations under overland flow conditions new equations were generated using the available datasets in this study according to the validation results for the new equations there is no need to separate the loess soil for the development of transport capacity functions the new equation gave satisfactory results for transport capacity predictions generated from the range of particles considered but equation accuracies may be limited by the calculation of critical shear stress for sands declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
6106,reliable estimation of sediment transport capacity is essential for soil erosion modeling the objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of twelve widely used transport capacity functions with a wide range of hydraulic conditions and soil properties the comparisons with observed data indicated that none of the selected twelve functions gave satisfactory results for transport capacity prediction over all overland flow datasets in this study and all of them gave very poor predictions for loess soil therefore a new equation was developed for sediment transport capacity estimation among these twelve functions the ali equation gave the best fit for the whole dataset but calibration was necessary when using it for large sediment grains 2 mm or loess soil the yalin equation and the simplified yalin equation worked better for soils than sands and predictions for smaller sands 0 2 mm were acceptable the govers equation had relatively uniform performance for all datasets the performance of empirical equations changed dramatically for different datasets a new function developed in this study was generated based on dimensional analysis and gave good predictions within the range of hydraulic conditions and particle sizes in the datasets considered in this study the results provide a summary of the transport capacity functions evaluated and suggest an improved function for modeling overland flow sediment transport capacity keywords sediment transport capacity overland flow hydraulic condition sediment particles 1 introduction soil erosion is a serious problem worldwide which causes problems such as decreased soil fertility degraded water quality and reduced reservoir storage the soil erosion process embodies the subprocesses of sediment detachment transport and deposition caused by the impacts of rainfall and runoff over the soil surface foster 1982 and these three subprocesses are correlated with each other the detachment transport coupling concept is the most widely used concept for combining these three subprocesses and it is the basis of the wepp water erosion prediction project flanagan et al 2001 the eurosem european soil erosion model morgan et al 1998 the lisem limburg soil erosion model de roo et al 1996 and the kineros2 kinematic wave overland flow channel routing and erosion model smith et al 1995 models in this concept transport capacity is the equilibrium sediment concentration approached at an infinite downslope distance given that hydraulic conditions discharge channel roughness slope etc do not change polyakov and nearing 2003 as assumed in this concept detachment rate could be calculated based on the deficit of transport capacity and net deposition occurs when sediment load in the flow exceeds transport capacity thus a reliable prediction of transport capacity is essential for all three subprocesses in soil erosion modeling two different scales are widely used for soil erosion modeling including predictions for hillslopes and watersheds hillslopes are used as the basic estimation areas where soil erodes and sediment loss accumulates which is a combination of contributions from rills and interrill areas since a distinct change of erosion rates is caused by rill development the rill channels are considered as an important component for sediment detachment and deposition and a major area for sediment transport therefore the estimation of sediment transport capacities in rills is discussed in this study which is under overland flow conditions given the significance of transport capacity estimation extensive studies have been conducted regarding better predictions by creating new equations modifying previous equations or evaluating performance of different equations based on the analysis of bed particle movement in channels einstein 1942 established an equation to calculate bed load transport and assumed that the critical tractive force does not exist and the grain motion is caused by turbulent fluctuation in yalin s study yalin 1963 a bed load sediment transport formula was generated on the basis of the existing critical tractive force which could be obtained from shields curve by analysis of saltating particles the yalin equation was derived under steady state conditions on a movable cohesionless bed with equal size grains instead of tractive force analysis a transport function was developed in yang s study 1973 based on the energy cost for incipient motion of particles he suggested the use of unit stream power rather than shear stress for sediment transport prediction rose et al 1983 created a new mathematical model for soil erosion estimation and the sediment concentration at the transport limit could be calculated using an effective stream power other than the theoretical analysis of particle movement the results of govers 1990 showed the possibility to predict sediment transport capacity using empirical relationships various empirical functions with different predictors have been developed under limited experimental conditions everaert 1991 zhang et al 2009 wang et al 2015 wu et al 2016 given the requirements to reduce computational time for utilizing the yalin equation for calculation foster 1987 a simplified yalin equation was developed for transport capacity calculation for use in the wepp model finkner et al 1989 the simplified equation provided closed form solutions for steady state conditions and reduced computational time in the ali et al 2013 study a new transport capacity equation was derived by adopting the same basic variables in the yang 1973 equation however the hydraulic conditions are different when applying these two functions the yang 1973 equation is for stream flow conditions and the ali 2013 equation is for overland flow conditions in the study of alonso et al 1981 nine sediment transport capacity functions were selected for evaluation using sets of measured data the yalin equation gave the best predictions for overland flow and the yang equation and the laursen equation performed better than the others for stream flow prediction in the range of fine to coarse sands and very fine sands to silts respectively however contradictory results were obtained from govers 1992 study which also evaluated the performance of several formulas including the yalin equation and he found that no one equation yielded good predictions over the whole range of overland flow conditions tested in his study and it was suggested that the former evaluations with promising results may have been due to the limited range of experimental conditions nord and esteves 2007 compared several sediment transport capacity functions by using the rill erosion databases of psem 2d and wepp they found that the govers 1990 equation which is based on unit stream power gave the best results for cohesive particles and the yalin 1963 equation the low 1989 equation and the govers 1990 equation did not perform well for cohesionless particles however in the study of ali et al 2013 the yalin equation and the low equation exhibited good agreement for sands and the govers equation was less accurate but provided similar accuracies for the entire range of sands to date extensive transport capacity formulas with different parameters were created or modified using various field or experimental databases even though some functions are widely used in soil erosion models their evaluation is inconsistent given the lack of data which adds to the difficulties for selecting appropriate functions the performance of each transport capacity function may differ for stream flow and overland flow conditions cohesive and non cohesive particles and different ranges of slope steepness given the shallow flow depth for overland flow conditions the continuously changing roughness tension may affect the flow characteristics foster and meyer 1972 also raindrop impacts would be more significant under shallower overland flow conditions in the research of beuselinck et al 2002 a water discharge threshold exists for a given hydraulic condition that within this threshold the previously deposited sediment particles are lifted into the water layer according to the raindrop impact the slope gradients are mostly steeper for overland flow compared with stream flow and poor predictions of transport capacity indicated that functions generated under flat slope conditions may not be appropriate for steep study areas govers 1992 these differences cause uncertainty as to whether the functions developed for stream flow could be used for overland flow sediment transport estimation however the observations of concentrated overland flow in rills provide some important similarities between stream flow and overland flow characteristics given the important role of rills to transport sediment from hillslopes to the hydrographic network some models e g wepp assume that interrill erosion is a process of sediment delivery to concentrated flow channels or rills and the sediment transport is calculated on a unit rill width basis therefore the possibility of applying stream flow equations on overland flow conditions exists in the study of alonso et al 1981 nine sediment transport formulas were considered and all of them were originally developed based upon stream flow conditions alonso et al 1981 used overland flow and sediment discharge data and their results showed that the yalin equation estimated sediment transport capacity well and it provided the possibility to utilize fluvial equations for overland transport prediction the observations of kilinc and richardson s 1973 study also reported that some bedload fluvial transport equations for channels could be applied as overland flow equations but calibration of parameters was required for the study area moreover foster and meyer s 1972 observations indicated that only bedload formulas for stream flow could be considered for overland flow evaluation and suspended load could be neglected the reason for the good performance of bedload equations was probably caused by the similar ways of sediment transport in channels and rills rolling sliding and saltation ali et al 2013 vast datasets have been used for sediment transport study on various beds with different sediment particles including cohesive soils and non cohesive sands considering the cohesion between particles more energy would be expended for cohesive particle detachment from the soil surface compared to non cohesive particles also it is recognized that cohesive sediments with lower settling velocities typically move over a relatively larger horizontal distance the differences between cohesive and non cohesive particle erosion challenge the application of a single function for both conditions however the study of foster and meyer 1972 observed that once aggregates were detached from cohesive soils their transport could be assumed as the same as that of non cohesive grains according to the study of proffitt et al 1991 the fraction of the soil surface covered by the deposited layer was about 90 this idea of large areas covered by cohesionless deposited particles provides the possibility to apply formulas generated from cohesionless sands for naturally cohesive soil sediment transport capacity prediction based on the same idea hairsine and rose 1992 gave the definition of transport capacity as the equilibrium sediment concentration when the whole surface was covered by the deposited non cohesive layer even though differences in settling velocities were observed between cohesive and non cohesive particles this settling velocity variable is included in many widely used transport capacity equations yang 1973 abrahams et al 2001 ali et al 2013 which could reduce the influence of particle cohesion given the different characteristics between different kinds of soils the utilization is questionable for one soil based or sand based function on another soil especially for loess soils which have a high percentage of silt causing very high erodibility the results of wu et al 2018 observed that the predicted sediment transport capacities in the lisem limburg soil erosion model increased by 62 compared to the measured values for loess soils so the application of the lisem in loess areas is uncertain in the study of wang et al 2015 the underestimation of transport capacities was obvious and cannot be ignored when using the wepp for loess soil erosion estimation given the great disparities among different kinds of study particles the consideration of soil characteristics is necessary for equation selection and sediment transport capacity estimation as a major factor for sediment transport capacity prediction slope steepness was considered in every function either as an individual factor or in other parameters e g shear stress unit stream power or stream power the proper slope ranges for the application of each equation were limited by their supporting database due to the mostly flat slope conditions of stream flow all previous fluvial transport capacity functions were generated with lower slope gradients and a similar relationship was assumed when using these functions in steep areas however the study of smart 1984 obtained different performances of the meyer peter and mueller 1948 equation for different slope ranges the meyer peter mueller equation was created on slopes from 0 04 to 2 and seriously underestimated the sediment transport rates on slopes steeper than 3 moreover the observations of lei et al 2001 showed that the transport capacities changed inconsistently for slopes less than 20 and greater than 20 with the same unit flow discharge so that 20 could be a critical slope for loess soil erosion experiments the inconsistent performances of one formula for different slope ranges indicates the reason to consider slope ranges for equation selection for the existing studies on the basis of either theoretical analysis or empirical relationships different parameters are used for transport capacity estimation shear stress unit stream power and stream power shear stress is defined as the force per unit wetted area that acts on a surface and it is calculated as yalin 1963 1 τ ρ w g h s where τ is the shear stress n m 2 ρw is the density of water kg m 3 g is the acceleration due to gravity m s 2 h is mean flow depth m and s is the slope gradient m m 1 based on the theory that movement of soil particles is caused by the drag and lift forces of flowing water the shear tress τ was used to control incipient motions of particles by analyzing the tractive forces for particles a critical value of shear stress τcr was considered in some studies yalin 1963 abrahams et al 2001 and must be exceeded before the particles begin to move in the studies involving empirical equations roberts et al 2003 zhang et al 2009 a strong correlation between transport capacities and shear stress was obtained similar to the shear stress parameter some equations engelund and hansen 1967 ackers and white 1973 low 1989 were developed using the shear velocity u for transport capacity calculation since bagnold 1966 emphasized the rate of energy expenditure rather than the forces applied to the bed yang 1973 defined unit stream power for prediction in terms of the power per unit weight of water and it is calculated as follows 2 p v s where p is the unit stream power m s 1 and v is average flow velocity m s 1 in the studies of yang 1973 govers 1990 and ali et al 2013 the critical unit stream power pcr at incipient motion was introduced for calculation but different approaches were identified in these studies for critical unit stream power computation the results of yang et al 2018 indicated that sediment transport was well predicted by unit stream power compared to shear stress or stream power the stream power is calculated as bagnold 1966 3 ω τ v ρ w g s q where ω is the stream power w m 2 and q is the overland flow discharge per unit width m2 s 1 the observations of abrahams et al 2001 indicated that 89 9 of the variance in transport capacity in their study could be explained by effective stream power ω ωc after evaluating the calculated sediment transport capacities using the guest griffith university erosion system template rose et al 1983 and the wepp mahmoodabadi et al 2014 observed that both models tended to under estimate transport capacity and stream power is a better predictor than shear stress the results of asadi et al 2011 indicated that the sediment transport mechanisms suspension saltation and rolling were related to stream power and soil type given the uncertainty of selecting functions for different overland flow conditions it is necessary to evaluate the performance of the widely recommended sediment transport capacity functions and to identify the suitability of these functions for each condition the purpose of this study is 1 to summarize the application ranges of selected transport capacity functions and 2 to generate a new sediment transport capacity function using data from a wide range of hydraulic conditions and particle sizes for overland flow estimation 2 selected transport capacity functions most existing transport capacity formulas were generated from theoretical analyses or empirical relationships and the theoretical analyses were mostly about tractive forces or energy expenditure for sediment movement according to the categories in table 1 the widely used functions in the asterisked studies for each category were selected for evaluation in this study in selecting formulas 1 the functions should be widely applied for sediment transport capacity estimation 2 equations from both theoretical and empirical analyses should be evaluated and 3 assessments of equations using shear stress unit stream power and stream power are required 1 yalin 1963

this reason no rainfall variable was included in this equation 8 guest equation rose et al 1983 in this model the ground surface was covered by either the original soil particles or the deposited layers a factor h was defined as the fraction of the surface covered by the deposited sediment then the sediment concentration at the transport limit could be obtained when h 1 which means the least

which transport capacity increased as a power function with increasing shear stress but the exponential value for shear stress was 1 982 which was much greater than the wepp exponent of 1 5 3 materials and methods the data used in this study for formula evaluations were from available literature and consisted of 529 flume experiments including 318 runs on sands 144 runs on cropland soils and 67 runs on loess soils the median particle sizes for all sand datasets and the particle size distributions for all soil datasets were available and used in the analysis the data are summarized in table 2 in this study the functions in the wepp model were used to calculate critical shear stress for the datasets without measured values and the equations without calculation methods for critical shear stress when calculating the critical shear stress for sands an adjustment factor was applied when the soil has sand content greater than 50 23 tcadjf 0 3 0 7 e 12 52 s a n d 0 5 where sand is

sand particles for soil datasets the size distributions were used to calculate settling velocities for sand datasets median sizes were used to represent the particle sizes for settling velocity calculation since the relatively uniform size of sands all of the selected formulas were used to compute sediment transport capacity equation performance was evaluated using graphical figures and the

observations in which the discrepancy ratio falls between 0 5 and 2 0 and n is the total number of observations 4 results and discussion 4 1 evaluation for selected transport capacity functions 4 1 1 function performance for cohesionless particles there were 318 runs with cohesionless particles used for this evaluation the experiments of smart 1984 were designed for steep channels with deep water flows and large particles which were close to stream flow conditions compared with the other datasets the studies of both aziz and scott 1989 and ali et al 2012 used sands with similar sizes from 0 2 mm to 1 0 mm but the study of ali et al 2012 was based on relatively shallow flows the datasets from zhang et al 2009 were obtained from a wide range of slopes including very steep gradients fig 1 shows the comparison between predicted and observed transport capacities for cohesionless particles using the functions tested for these cohesionless particles the yalin equation and the simplified yalin equation typically overestimated results for sand sizes considered but gave acceptable predictions for small sands 0 285 mm 0 230 mm and 0 280 mm there were large discrepancies between measured and predicted values for measured transport capacities over 10 0 kg m 1 s 1 for the yalin equation and the simplified yalin equation the values of p o 0 5 2 0 for the finest particles 0 230 mm 0 280 and 0 285 mm were around or over 50 and reached 98 44 and 93 75 for 0 280 mm sands based on the zhang et al 2009 dataset table 3 however the discrepancy ratio values between 0 5 and 2 0 were zero for most other datasets smart 1984 aziz and scott 1989 when cohesionless particle size was greater than 0 3 mm these results partially agreed with those reported by ali et al 2013 who found the accuracies of the yalin equation gradually decreased with increases in grain size but the p o 0 5 2 0 value was greater than 50 for coarse sands 0 50 1 00 mm a possible reason for the differences is that critical shear stress measured in the experiments may have been different from the critical shear stress values calculated in this study using the function for sandy soils from the wepp model therefore it is reasonable for the yalin equation and the simplified yalin equation to predict sediment transport capacities for cohesionless particles smaller than 0 3 mm but the equations are questionable for particle sizes over 0 3 mm the ali equation gave the best fit for cohesionless particles ranging from 0 230 to 1 022 mm fig 1 and the value of p o 0 5 2 0 was 64 15 considering all datasets table 3 one possible reason for these results is that the ali equation was derived from the ali dataset using 0 23 mm to 1 022 mm sands and it showed good performance for the sands within the same size range 0 2 1 0 mm as expected however for very coarse particles 2 0 mm the ali equation underestimated the transport capacities and the calculated p o 0 5 2 0 values were less than 40 and even zero for some particle sizes 2 0 mm and 4 3 mm the results of the ali equation showed that it can accurately estimate the sediment transport capacities for most sands 2 0 mm but calibration is necessary for larger grains 2 10 mm broad scatter was shown around the agreement line between predicted and measured transport capacities with similar patterns for all cohesionless particle sizes when using the govers equation fig 1 the calculated values of p o 0 5 2 0 were relatively uniform and the p o 0 5 2 0 value was 41 51 for the overall data the govers equation tended to overestimate transport capacities for measurements less than 1 0 kg m 1 s 1 and underestimate for measurements over 1 0 kg m 1 s 1 similar results were found in the studies of hessel and jetten 2007 and ali et al 2013 that relatively uniform performances were obtained for all cohesionless particles considered when using the govers equation these results showed potential for use of the govers equation to predict transport capacities for overland flow conditions but also indicated the need for equation calibration since most p o 0 5 2 0 values were around 50 the guy equation and the abrahams gao equation worked well in predicting transport capacities for large particles 2 0 mm and the calculated p o 0 5 2 0 values increased as grain size increased the guy equation showed good agreement between predicted and measured values for sediment transport capacities over 1 0 kg m 1 s 1 one possible reason is the use of excess water discharge as the main parameter in the guy equation which is the difference between water discharge and critical water discharge the excess water discharge emphasized the impacts of water discharge and improved the accuracy when evaluating larger flows with greater sediment transport the abrahams gao equation gave dramatically different p o 0 5 2 0 values for similar particle sizes in different datasets aziz and scott 1989 ali et al 2013 and greater p o 0 5 2 0 values were obtained with larger discharges smart 1984 aziz and scott 1989 one possible reason is the abrahams gao equation was generated based on larger discharge experiments including the smart 1984 dataset in this study the engelund hansen equation the abrahams equation and the guest model underestimated sediment transport capacities for the entire cohesionless database calibrations were needed when using these equations to predict transport capacity for cohesionless particles in the guest model a variable f is designed to describe the fraction of the excess stream power effective in re entrainment of sediments and the calibration of the f variable before applying the guest model improves the accuracy of predictions the yang equation gave very poor predictions for cohesionless particles a possible reason is that the method to calculate critical unit stream power given by the yang equation cannot be used for the hydraulic conditions and particles considered in this study no empirical equations performed well for all cohesionless particles considered in this study and their performance changed dramatically when using different datasets 4 1 2 function performance for soils data from 144 experiments on cropland soils were considered for transport capacity evaluation including two types of soil nansene silt loam and amarillo loamy sand the median particle sizes were different for these two soils and the particles were smaller compared with sand particles the govers equation gave the best predicted transport capacities for cropland soils with the lowest scatter in this study fig 2 this function tended to over predict transport capacities for both particles studied nansene and amarillo but most predictions were within the range of half to twice the observations fig 2 thus the values of p o 0 5 2 0 were as great as 94 44 for the nansene soil and 80 56 for the amarillo soil table 4 the over estimation was likely caused by the dataset used for the govers 1990 equation generation which were obtained on bed materials including coarse particles 0 414 mm and 1 098 mm the ali equation the yalin equation and the simplified yalin equation showed good agreement between observed and predicted transport capacities but produced greater scatter compared to the govers function fig 2 the ali equation gave better predictions for nansene soil p o 0 5 2 0 95 83 compared to the predictions for amarillo soil p o 0 5 2 0 59 72 table 4 a possible reason for the inconsistent results is that the ali equation was derived from experiments on sands d50 0 230 mm and calibration was necessary when applying it on cropland soils the yalin equation and the simplified yalin equation gave similar p o 0 5 2 0 values for both cropland soils considered in this study table 4 with the consideration of the results from cohesionless particles the yalin equation and the simplified yalin equation performed better for finer particles d50 0 2 mm and cropland soils some equations performed better for one kind of cropland soil such as the engelund hansen equation the abrahams equation and the guest model fig 2 the guest model produced less scatter compared to the abrahams equation and the engelund hansen equation fig 2 and model calibration was necessary when using the guest model on different cropland soils dramatic differences are evident between the calculated p o 0 5 2 0 values for the two cropland soils in this study when using the abrahams and engelund hansen equations table 4 the poor performance of the abrahams equation agreed with the findings of ali et al 2013 and hessel and jetten 2007 who also obtained unsatisfactory predictions with it and concluded this equation was not suitable for overland flow conditions for the empirical functions considered the beasley huggins equation showed good agreement between observed and predicted transport capacities and the zhang equation ω gave good predictions for the amarillo soil fig 2 the calculated p o 0 5 2 0 values for the beasley huggins equation were greater than 70 for both soils table 4 which indicates the possibility of application of this function for sediment transport capacity predictions on cropland soils the guy equation and the abrahams gao equation gave poor predictions for both soils fig 2 from the results for cohesionless particles these two functions gave improved performance for larger particles which was likely the reason that they cannot be used for fine particles i e cropland soils the yang equation greatly over predicted the sediment transport capacities for the two cropland soils in this study 4 1 3 function performance for loess soils there were 67 loess soil experimental runs used in this study which included water depths ranging from 1 30 to 4 15 mm and average flow velocity ranging from 0 16 to 1 32 m s the wu et al 2018 experiments were designed with deeper runoff and greater water discharges compared with wang et al 2015 the slope gradients in these two studies were steep and similar to the situation in the loess plateau of china no function gave acceptable predictions for the two loess soils in this study fig 3 table 5 the possible reason is the large differences between loess soil and the other two soil particle types cohesionless particles and cropland soils and that the loess soil contains much more silt e g 86 3 silt in the soil in wang et al 2015 the characteristics of the silty soil and the steep slope caused very high erodibility and very serious loess soil erosion problems none of the functions selected in this study were generated based on data from loess soils and thus no function worked well for predicting transport capacity on them the zhang equation was the only one with relatively acceptable results for loess soils with p o 0 5 2 0 values over 50 for both loess datasets however this function gave inconsistent performance with these datasets and thus its use is questionable the evaluation of selected transport capacity functions showed that performance was different on cohesionless particles cropland soils and loess soils most functions only gave reasonable results for the hydraulic and sediment conditions for which they were generated based on the cohesionless particle results the ali equation gave the best fit for most study grain sizes 0 230 1 022 mm but it under predicted transport capacities for large particles d50 2 0 mm the govers equation gave relatively uniform but poor results for cohesionless particles with p o 0 5 2 0 values around 50 the guy equation and the abrahams gao equation worked better for larger cohesionless particles d50 2 0 mm the yalin equation and the simplified yalin equation produced better predictions for smaller cohesionless particles d50 0 2 mm from the cropland soil results the govers equation gave the best agreement between observed and predicted sediment transport capacities the yalin equation and the simplified yalin equation produced good and consistent predictions for the two kinds of cropland soils in this study the ali equation predicted transport capacities well for cropland soils considered in this study but the performances varied substantially for the two particle sizes no functions selected for this study could be used for sediment transport capacity prediction on loess soils since none of them had good and consistent performance this result was likely caused by the very silty characteristics of the loess soils from the previous evaluation none of the selected twelve functions could be used to predict sediment transport capacities for all of the overland flow conditions considered in this study therefore it is necessary to identify the applicability range of the transport capacity function before using it for prediction no distinct findings were observed to show whether shear stress unit stream power or stream power was better for transport capacity prediction hence further analysis is required to select parameters for the generation of a new equation to obtain better predictions for the complete datasets used in this study 4 2 function generation 4 2 1 function development before the selection of variables for the generation of a new equation the data from the 529 available flume runs were used for correlation analysis this database covered a wide range of soil particles slope gradients hydraulic conditions and sediment transport capacities the parameters in the existing transport capacity functions were also included in this correlation analysis as the factors influencing the sediment transport capacity in overland flows these parameters could be categorized as physical and hydraulic properties of the flow q water discharge v average flow velocity h water depth characteristics of sediment particles d50 median size w50 settling velocity for d50 and boundary geometry s slope steepness the main parameters are shear stress τ unit stream power p and stream power ω and the determination of the sediment incipient motion was based on the critical values of these main parameters in order to select the variables for the new equation development the following constraints had to be taken into account a the parameters should have a high correlation with measured sediment transport capacity b the parameters should be easy to obtain in the field or laboratory so that the new equation could be readily applied c the data should be explained in the simplest way possible and redundant parameters removed and d the parameters should not be highly correlated with each other the correlations between all parameters considered and measured sediment transport capacity are shown in table 6 based on the listed constraints the hydraulic parameters q and h and the particle characteristic parameter w were selected according to the correlation between the three main parameters and measured sediment transport capacity the shear stress and the stream power and their corresponding excess values gave almost equal and high correlation values considering the application of the new equation excess flow shear stress was selected for prediction since more studies exist to estimate critical shear stress as the amount of energy dissipated per unit of time and per unit of bed surface stream power ω was also selected for predicting transport capacity besides the selected parameters based on correlation analysis other fundamental factors were also included for the new equation generation g gravitational acceleration ρs sediment density and ρw water density after the selection of variables the transport capacity could be expressed as follows 25 t c f q h w τ τ c ω ρ s ρ w g in eq 25 the fundamental factors ρw and g are constants for a given environment in the buckingham pi theorem in dimensional analysis the number of repeating variables should be selected according to the dimensions given three dimensions mass length and time in eq 25 the sediment density ρs the water depth h and the settling velocity w were considered repeating variables which contained all three dimensions and they were used to generate the pi groups in the buckingham pi theorem after forcing pi to be dimensionless eq 25 becomes 26a t c ρ s q f q wh τ τ c ρ s ρ w g h ω w ρ s ρ w g h ρ s ρ w ρ s thus the dimensionless transport capacity t c ρ s q could be written as 26b t c ρ s q a q wh b τ τ c ρ s ρ w g h c ω w ρ s ρ w g h d ρ s ρ w ρ s e where a b c d e are constant coefficients from the total of 529 available experimental data about three quarters 397 runs were selected as the database for equation generation and the remaining 132 runs were selected for validation the selection of the data was random and both the generation database and the validation database contained experimental data from every dataset cohesionless dataset cropland dataset and loess dataset after regression analysis using the generated database equation 26b becomes 27 t c ρ s q 0 195 q wh 0 520 τ τ c ρ s ρ w g h 1 864 ω w ρ s ρ w g h 0 689 ρ s ρ w ρ s 5 918 the previous results indicated that all transport capacity functions considered could not be utilized in loess areas this suggests the possibility that the sediment transport processes may be different for loess soil compared with other soils therefore another equation was created based on the generated database without including the loess soils 331 runs the new alternative equation was 28 t c ρ s q 0 253 q wh 1 391 τ τ c ρ s ρ w g h 2 507 ω w ρ s ρ w g h 1 422 ρ s ρ w ρ s 4 800 when using eq 27 and eq 28 for sediment transport capacity prediction with the particle distribution data the settling velocity w is for the corresponding particle size class the transport capacity would be calculated for each particle size class and summed based on the particle size distribution when median value could represent the particle size e g uniform sands the settling velocity w in these two equations is the value for the median particle size w50 4 2 2 validation of new equations as mentioned before data from 132 runs were used for the validation of these two equations eqs 27 and 28 the results for each dataset are shown in table 7 and fig 4 even though eq 28 was created from the database without any data from experiments on loess soils this equation provided acceptable transport capacity predictions for the loess soils since data from only 17 runs on loess soils were included in the validation database the whole loess soil database 67 runs was used for the validation of eq 28 and the results are shown in fig 5 the p o 0 5 2 0 values for wang et al 2015 experiments and wu et al 2018 experiments were 80 00 and 64 29 respectively which means that 80 and 64 of the predictions in the corresponding dataset were within the range of half to twice the observations therefore the selected variables and the form of the equation could be utilized for transport capacity prediction for all particles considered in this study since the generation database for eq 27 contained loess datasets the accuracies of the predictions increased for loess soils compared with the results of eq 28 in table 7 eq 27 was better suited for transport capacity prediction for the validation database compared to eq 28 as shown in table 7 even though eq 28 was created from the database without loess soil data the results showed predictions with greater scatter for cohesionless particles and cropland soils this could be caused due to several reasons first both eqs 27 and 28 could be utilized for transport capacity calculations on loess soil thus it is unnecessary to delete loess soil data as an exception for equation generation second these two equations both gave unsatisfactory results for the ali et al 2012 dataset without the loess soil dataset the impacts of the ali et al dataset in the generation database increased and the performance of eq 28 decreased the performance of eq 27 for each validation dataset is shown in fig 6 observed values that were underestimated and others that were overestimated fell outside the half to twice range when using the ali et al 2012 dataset possible reasons include that the lowest water depths and slowest average velocities were used in the ali et al experiments when the calculated critical shear stress was around the shear stress in these situations the accuracy could be influenced greatly by a slight change of surface roughness second the particles used in ali et al study were pure sands the errors could be caused by the calculation of critical shear stress in this study which was for sandy soil more than 50 sand other than pure sands for the results of other cohesionless datasets aziz and scott 1989 smart 1984 zhang et al 2009 in fig 6 most predictions were slightly overestimated but still within the half to twice range these overestimates could be caused by the calculation of critical shear stress therefore eq 27 would be better for transport capacity prediction compared with eq 28 and could be used for the cohesionless particles cropland soils and loess soils in this study 5 summary and conclusions in this study the application of twelve widely used sediment transport capacity equations was evaluated based on a large range of particles slopes and overland flow hydrologic conditions both graphical and statistical analysis were performed and presented the results indicated that none of the twelve widely used equations gave satisfactory results to estimate transport capacities for the overall datasets in this study and all of them gave very poor predictions for loess soil this implies the necessity to improve transport capacity prediction for wider ranges of data among these twelve functions the ali equation gave the best fit for the whole database but calibration was necessary when using it for large grains d50 2 mm or loess soils the yalin equation and the simplified yalin equation worked better for cropland soils than sands and predictions for smaller sands 0 2 mm were acceptable other than the yalin equation and the simplified yalin equation the guy equation and the abrahams gao equation gave better predictions for larger grains d50 2 mm and the accuracy of predictions increased as particle size increased the govers equation gave relatively uniform performances for all datasets the yang equation performed poorly when predicting transport capacity for the entire database in this study the performance of empirical equations changed dramatically for different datasets to improve the accuracy of sediment transport capacity calculations under overland flow conditions new equations were generated using the available datasets in this study according to the validation results for the new equations there is no need to separate the loess soil for the development of transport capacity functions the new equation gave satisfactory results for transport capacity predictions generated from the range of particles considered but equation accuracies may be limited by the calculation of critical shear stress for sands declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
6107,coastal aquifers can be considered as an important socio economic and ecological component worldwide the implementation of sustainable groundwater management is made difficult by complex hydrological behaviors due to many interactions between groundwater and fresh brackish and salt surface water this study proposes an original multi tracer approach including physico chemical parameters trace elements 18o 2h 3h of the water molecule and emerging organic compounds eocs in order to improve the understanding of strongly urbanized coastal aquifers this methodology was applied to a mediterranean coastal aquifer in northern corsica france firstly the isotopic data allow highlighting the complex recharge of groundwater provided by both allochthonous rainfall from the mountain and autochthonous rainfall on the marana casinca alluvial plain secondly geochemical data coupled with isotopic signatures allow the identification of the different contributors and the quantification of the mixing processes into the aquifer the residence time of groundwater were estimated with 3h in addition to display inertial areas with long residence time 3h also highlights areas subject to infiltration of recent water a better understanding of short time hydrological processes was improved by eocs the study of the fate of eocs in the environment provided a higher level of resolution than geochemical and isotopic tracers alone thus the multi tracing approach using isotopic and geochemical data coupled with the study of the fate of eocs made possible to specify the conceptual model in highly anthropized hydrosystems and particularly fast hydrological processes keywords aquifer lagoon water residence time water mixing groundwater dependent ecosystem corsica 1 introduction coastal aquifers ensure a fundamental role for both anthropogenic activities and environmental preservation they supply a large quantity of freshwater for drinking agricultural and industrial uses in many countries sappa et al 2015 comte et al 2016 they also provide a large part of the fresh water supplies to coastal wetlands consequently referred as groundwater dependent ecosystems gde cartwright and gilfedder 2015 krogulec 2016 menció et al 2017 these sensitive environments play a major ecological role and provide a number of ecosystem services such as food production recreation areas coastal and soil protection and climate regulation de groot et al 2002 rao et al 2015 newton et al 2018 velasco et al 2018 with the global change effects the importance of groundwater supplies should be exacerbated especially in the mediterranean area ipcc 2014 sellami et al 2016 calvache et al 2017 the expected modifications in precipitation patterns aquifer recharge rates and groundwater uses are among the many factors what should greatly impact the groundwater management in coastal areas these predicted disruptions are added to an already very precarious fresh water salt water equilibrium coastal aquifers can be influenced by several fresh and saline water bodies i e groundwater surface water transitional water and seawater the resulting mixing processes between these different water bodies then lead to a complex hydrodynamic behavior the determination and quantification of each end member participation can be assessed by well known indicators such as groundwater geochemical composition prada et al 2015 santoni et al 2016b wang et al 2016 and isotopic signatures liu and yamanaka 2012 gautam et al 2018 however other less commonly applied tracers such as emerging organic pollutants eocs can be helpful to determine the contribution of particular anthropogenic components sewage urban and agricultural runoff into the aquifers lapworth et al 2012 eocs are closely linked to anthropogenic consumption pharmaceuticals domestic use or personal care compounds and its detection in the environment is growing due to the development of analytical tools richardson and ternes 2018 among multiple pathways to the environment the occurrence of eocs in natural waters is mainly related to urban runoff and wastewaters lapworth et al 2012 vystavna et al 2012 sui et al 2015 hence eocs are detectable in every anthropized areas impacted by sewage contamination this is especially true in coastal areas where the rapid urbanization in response to a growing demography small and nicholls 2003 often induces water contamination by septic tank or leakages from sewers dougherty et al 2010 metcalfe et al 2011 del rosario et al 2014 the eocs persistence in natural waters and particularly in groundwater is difficult to constrain due to their largely under investigated behavior in environmental media lapworth et al 2012 according to their own physical and chemical properties some eocs can be exceptionally persistent whereas other can be easily degradable in the environment el shahawi et al 2010 vystavna et al 2013 vystavna et al 2017 to some extent the persistence of eocs can provide useful information on groundwater residence time recharge and mixing processes sassine et al 2015 zirlewagen et al 2016 for example the presence of rapidly degradable eocs will indicate short residence time and recent anthropogenic influence lapworth et al 2018 in contrast the presence of persistent eocs can indicate the archiving and or the low retention capacities of the aquifer the known degradation patterns of eocs can therefore supplement geochemical and isotopic tracers to detail the temporal resolution of hydrological processes the occurrence of eocs is also used to evaluate the infiltration of contaminated and non contaminated surface water into the aquifers and to identify recharge areas sassine et al 2015 the aim of this study is to put forward an innovative approach combining geochemical isotopic data with the fate of emerging compounds in groundwater in order to 1 understand the behavior of anthropized hydrosystems 2 evaluate the anthropogenic impact and 3 precise groundwater surface water interaction and rapid infiltration this study focuses on the marana casinca hydrosystem located in the north east of corsica island france as a representative example of mediterranean socio economic conditions in this coastal hydrosystem the sensitive biguglia coastal lagoon represents the ultimate water collector of a strongly anthropized watershed 2 study area 2 1 geological and hydrological settings the biguglia lagoon is located in the northern part of the corsica island western mediterranean france in the south of the densely urbanized city of bastia fig 1 this shallow brackish coastal lagoon maximum depth of 1 8 m is part of the largest wetland in corsica with a surface of 14 5 km2 located along the coastline the length of the lagoon is around 11 km with a width of up to 2 5 km in the southern part the biguglia lagoon is connected with the tyrrhenian sea by a narrow natural channel at its northern end exchange between the lagoon and the sea water is limited mouillot et al 2000 pasqualini et al 2017 mainly because of sand accumulations that regularly fill and close the channel the lagoon has been classified as natural reserve since 1994 and recognized as a ramsar site in 1991 convention on wetlands of international importance especially as waterfowl habitat 1971 which emphasizes on the international relevance of this study area the region is under a typical mediterranean climate implying large seasonal and inter annual variations of temperatures and precipitations the mean annual temperature and precipitation measured at the bastia météo france station are 15 8 c and 774 mm respectively mean calculated for 1957 2016 the biguglia lagoon watershed is a fairly large area with around 182 km2 and bound to the west and the north by high reliefs until 1450 masl formed by lustrous schist formations fig 1 the southern part of the watershed is formed by the marana casinca alluvial plain the watershed is drained by a major river the bevincu river to the north and several smaller non perennial tributaries only flowing during the rainfall periods besides the golu river which originates at 2525 masl in the hercynian massifs of inner corsica is connected to the lagoon by an artificial channel the marana casinca alluvial plain is composed by quaternary sediment deposits and consists of east to west oriented nested paleo terraces eroded by the two main rivers the golu river and the bevincu river the alluvial terraces were formed during the last glacial phases and were altered during interglacial periods regardless of their age all terraces are composed of gravels pebbles or blocks in a sandy loamy matrix conchon 1972 1978 the marana casinca alluvial plain represents the main aquifer system of the region this shallow alluvial aquifer is constituted by the combination of the two hydraulically connected alluvial aquifers of the bevincu and the golu this aquifer is spread over 80 km2 with a thickness of 3 40 m and a hydraulic conductivity around 10 3 10 4 m s orofino et al 2010 it is mostly developed in the middle and upper wurmian alluvial deposits fy2 and fy3 fig 1 and perched on an impermeable clay deposit layer formed during the lower wurmian fy1 the piezometric map fig 2 a based on piezometric measurements realized in april 2015 clearly shows that groundwater flows towards the lagoon with gradients between 3 and 5 orofino et al 2010 garel et al 2016 thus the alluvial aquifer is a significant source of freshwater for the lagoon making the latter an important coastal gde 2 2 anthropogenic impact the surface hydrology and the natural behavior of the whole hydrosystem are strongly controlled by man made hydraulic infrastructures in the early 20th century an artificial drainage network fig 1 was constructed channels represent a specified head boundary condition and drain the surface groundwater they therefore lower the water table and allow to dry up the marana casinca alluvial plain in order to use the land for agricultural activities and mosquito control then five pumping stations located on the west coast of the lagoon pump the water in the channels when the levels are too high and re allocate this freshwater directly into the lagoon the huge water volumes withdrawn by the pumping stations between 23 mm3 y and 39 mm3 y result from the mixing of fresh groundwater and salt lagoon water consequently estimating the exact groundwater volume extracted from the alluvial aquifer is currently impossible the alluvial aquifer is used for the drinking water supply of bastia s urban area almost 72 000 inhabitants the water demand is increasing simultaneously with the growing urbanization that started in the 1950 s as well as touristic pressure especially during the summer the water volumes pumped for the drinking supply represent about 4 mm3 y national water data bank http www bnpe eaufrance fr over the last century urbanized areas on the catchment have considerably developed the rate of urbanization has particularly increased since the beginning of the 21st century mainly on the marana casinca alluvial plain fox et al 2012 currently the coast of biguglia is one of the french coasts undergoing the highest rate of artificialization robert et al 2018 the sewage mains are located on the marana casinca alluvial plain and these old infrastructures induce many leakages which represent the main pollution source to the alluvial aquifer erostate et al 2018 the treatment efficiency of the sanitation system is strained by the large seasonal fluctuation of wastewater volume because of a highly variable amount of tourists in addition to groundwater the lagoon water quality is also deteriorated due to eutrophication

the soil water balance swb method initially proposed by thornthwaite 1948 and improved by dingman 2002 were applied daily rainfall mm temperature c and potential evapotranspiration pet mm provided by météo france rainfall station of bastia for the 01 1957 12 2016 period were used the rainfall composition used to calculate the ionic concentrations supplied by rainfall to groundwater was approximated by the rainfall composition measured in bonifacio nearest station with data along the east coast of corsica from 01 2013 to 12 2014 santoni et al 2018 3 6 end member mixing analysis a ternary mixing model based on geochemical and isotopic composition of groundwater was used to constrain the participation of the different water bodies calculation was carried out using microsoft excel and also checked using the mix2 program vázquez suñé et al 2010 differences between the two approaches were less than 10 4 results and discussion 4 1 aquifer recharge rate estimation the mean annual alluvial aquifer recharge rate is about 127 mm which corresponds to 16 of the 777 mm of mean annual rainfall 01 1957 12 2016 period table 2 this result is consistent with the previously estimated infiltration rates from 9 to 26 for alluvial aquifers in the mediterranean area candela et al 2009 ghiglieri et al 2012 stigter et al 2014 the annual recharge rates display an important inter annual variability table 2 consistent with the western mediterranean context scozzafava and tallini 2001 pulido velazquez et al 2017 santoni et al 2018 the rainfall amount particularly variable from one year to another induces an extremely variable annual aquifer recharge rate ranging from 14 to 427 mm y which represent 3 to 31 of the total annual rainfall respectively table 2 the values of estimated annual aquifer recharge rate also vary from one method to another both turc and swb methods improved by dingman provided similar results with mean inter annual recharge rates between 128 mm and 143 mm the initial swb proposed by thornwaite seems to underestimate the recharge rate 98 mm this method which requires fewer parameters than the swb method improved by dingman and does not take into account snowfall seems less appropriated thereby combining several methods is consequently the best approach to calculate realistic aquifer recharge rate estimations scanlon et al 2006 santoni et al 2018 4 2 groundwater origin the relationships between δ2h and δ18o in groundwater river lagoon and sea water samples are shown in fig 3 the isotopic composition of groundwater ranges from 9 33 to 3 38 for δ18o and from 62 5 to 6 4 for δ2h table 3 and 4 most of the groundwater samples are plotted between the global meteoric water line gmwl craig 1961 and the western mediterranean meteoric water

1992 for the 12 2013 04 2017 period this water line was proposed considering only non evaporated samples to exclude the effects of sub cloud evaporation froehlich et al 2008 santoni et al 2018 the

and sicily italy δ2h 6 75 δ18o 8 2 liotta et al 2013 groundwater from the northern part of the study area is plotted on the bmwl characterized by δ18o between 7 83 and 5 75 and by δ2h between 46 6 and 34 8 fig 3 these depleted signatures close to the annual weighted means of isotopes in rainwater collected in corte central corsica 450 masl 7 3 for δ 18 and 48 for δ2h suggest a recharge from high altitude precipitation huneau et al 2015 thus groundwater from the northern part of the alluvial aquifer benefits from an allochthonous recharge from the headwater catchment essentially formed by lustrous schists groundwater from the southern part of the study area and the sand bar is more enriched in 18o and 2h with values ranging from 7 58 to 3 38 for δ18o and from 46 8 to 6 4 for δ2h fig 3 isotopic signatures are plotted along the bmwl close to the annual weighted mean of isotopes in rainwater collected from the bastia station 1 masl 6 1 f or δ18o and 36 f or δ2h huneau et al 2015 the good correlation between the isotopic values of groundwater and the precipitation collected at bastia rainfall station fig 3 is in favor of a similar meteoric origin and then highlights an autochthonous recharge groundwater from the golu river alluvium a33 fig 1 and from the bevincu river r1 to r5 are more depleted in 18o from 9 33 to 9 13 and from 8 81 to 7 44 respectively and 2h from 62 0 to 59 0 and from 55 9 to 43 9 respectively fig 3 this very depleted signature highlights high altitude water origin from the inner corsica mountainous headwater catchment where the sources of the rivers are located the isotopic composition of groundwater is clearly different from that of the seawater composition 8 6 for δ2h and 1 1 for δ18o the groundwater samples a28 april and september samples a29 and a30 are plotted along the evaporation line the three piezometers are located in a quarry for aggregate building material the extraction leads to a rise in the water table and allows the formation of several small ponds that are subject to evaporation processes groundwater is therefore locally influenced by the re infiltration of this surface water the isotopic signatures of the lagoon water fig 3 indicate mixing processes with seawater the enriched isotopic signatures slightly below the seawater freshwater mixing line also highlight the evaporation processes affecting the lagoon water gemitzi et al 2014 4 3 groundwater quality characterization groundwater temperatures are around 16 7 c tables 3 and 4 close to the mean annual air temperature in bastia s region 15 8 c the lowest temperatures and ec are mainly observed in groundwater close to the rivers the bevincu river the golu river and the pietre turchine river groundwater from the schist formations displays alkaline ph from 7 1 to 7 5 and high ec mean of 884 µs cm tables 3 and 4 the ca2 hco3 water type tends towards a na k water type indicating important interactions with the calcareous schist formations fig 4 groundwater from the northern part is characterized by slightly alkaline ph mean of 7 2 and relatively high ec mean of 536 µs cm tables 3 and 4 the groundwater mineralization is predominantly controlled by high concentrations in calcium magnesium and bicarbonate giving a hco3 ca2 mg2 water type fig 4 their geochemical compositions are generally plotted between the groundwater compositions measured in schist formations and river waters suggesting likewise important mixing processes within the alluvial aquifer fig 5 no3 concentrations are generally low mean 7 mg l tables 3 and 4 which indicates a limited anthropogenic impact groundwater from the southern part is slightly acidic mean ph around 6 9 tables 3 and 4 ec is lower mean of 497 µs cm and its geochemical composition is closer to the river water composition fig 5 the higher concentrations in cl and so4 2 associated with no3 concentrations above the natural baseline between 5 and 7 mg l appelo and postma 2005 santoni et al 2016a b indicate an anthropogenic impact fig 4 finally groundwater from the sand bar and lagoon waters display the highest ec values mean of 2355 µs cm and 35 065 µs cm respectively and high cl na k concentrations tables 3 and 4 suggesting seawater mixing influences s1 s3 and s6 located on the sand bar display significantly high concentrations for most measured metallic trace elements mte especially li and b table 5 suggesting coastal water influence yet the high concentrations in mn fe zn and as up to 220 56 µg l 181 88 µg l 18 93 µg l and 19 55 µg l respectively also suggest the impact of anthropogenic pollution infiltration table 5 4 4 residence time and water rock interaction tritium concentrations range from 1 2 to 4 2 tu with a mean value of 3 1 tu tables 3 and 4 the local 3h content of rain water in about 3 8 tu erostate et al 2018 iaea wmo 2019 groundwater from schist formations sc1 and a23 presents the lowest 3h concentrations with a mean of 1 9 tu and 1 3 tu respectively these low concentrations argue in favour of groundwater with relatively long residence time the sample from the schist formations sc1 indicates the long residence times for water resources from the relatively impervious sediments with minimal connectivity to surface water for the sample point a23 a previous study has already highlighted that this deep well 23 m benefits from a low contribution from recently infiltrated water erostate et al 2018 which explains the low 3h concentration the highest 3h concentrations 5 2 and 4 2 tu are measured in a10 and a33 respectively localized close to the bevincu river and the golu river respectively these high 3h contents tables 3 and 4 and geochemical composition similar to river water composition fig 5 argue in favor of a significant recharge by recently infiltrated water brought by the river finally groundwater from the southern part displays 3h concentrations median value of 3 4 tu higher than those of groundwater from the northern part median value of 2 3 tu therefore groundwater from the southern part presents shorter residence times suggesting a greater contribution of recently infiltrated water to the recharge of the alluvial aquifer chemical composition fig 5 and saturation indices tables 3 and 4 reflect the lithological control on groundwater all groundwater samples are saturated with respect to quartz and or chalcedony the water rock interaction processes involving the schist formations as well as the schistous and granitic nature of alluvial deposits favor the dissolution of chalcedony and quartz minerals groundwater samples are generally undersaturated with respect to carbonate minerals only the saturation indices of groundwater from schist formations sc1 sc2 and sc3 approach saturation with respect to carbonate schist groundwater are enriched in hco3 ca2 na and mg2 in accordance with the nature of the basement mainly constituted by metamorphosed carbonates lahondère et al 1994 the hydrolysis of silicate minerals constituting part of the schistous formations could also locally participate to the observed ionic contents the long residence time of schist groundwater 1 9 tu is in favor of longer interactions with the rock and allows dissolving more minerals leading to an equilibrium with respect to the carbonate minerals and an alkaline ph groundwater from the northern part can be distinguished from that occurring in the southern part by a marked enrichment in hco3 ca2 na and mg2 fig 5 reflecting the predominant influence of schist groundwater in this sector the depletion in hco3 ca2 na and mg2 concentrations from the northern to the southern parts display the progressive decrease in schist groundwater participation the undersaturation with respect to carbonate minerals also suggests a low availability of carbonate minerals and or important mixing processes with low mineralized water the concentrations in cl ca2 na and mg2 measured in the lagoon are in favor of a contribution of both freshwater and seawater the geochemical composition allows the identification of the three water bodies interacting within the alluvial aquifer schist groundwater river water and sea water fig 5 thus particular consideration must be given to the quantification of mixing processes in the alluvial aquifer 4 5 end member characterization and mixing processes taking into account the circulations of water in the alluvial system the chemical composition of groundwater is influenced by four potential end members 1 groundwater from schist formations fig 1 is defined by the mean concentrations in cl hco3 and mean δ18o isotopic signatures measured in sc1 sc2 and sc3 during high flow and low flow conditions this end member is characterized by high hco3 concentrations mean of 409 3 mg l and moderate cl concentrations mean of 39 3 mg l in agreement with the geogenic control the relative depletion in δ18o 7 1 is consistent with the high recharge altitude taking place in the upper part of the watershed 2 river water corresponds to the mean values measured at r1 to r5 this end member is characterized by low concentrations in cl mean value 15 7 mg l and hco3 mean value 167 1 mg l and depleted signature in δ18o mean value 8 1 explained by the high altitude of the source of the rivers 3 seawater is characterized by a very high concentration in cl 21293 9 mg l low concentration in hco3 154 2 mg l and enriched isotopic signature in δ18o 1 1 4 local rainfall is a non negligible natural source of recharge for the aquifer table 2 but contains very low amounts of ions concentrations supplied by rainfall to groundwater can be calculated by using the following equation appelo and postma 2005 2 concentrationfactor p peff w m ions where p represents the total volume of annual precipitation peff refers to the effective rainfall the total volume of annual precipitation the total annual evapotranspiration and wm is the weighted mean of each ionic concentration for the period of measurement the calculation gives the major ions concentrations of the local supply by rainfall hco3 18 1 mg l cl 12 4 mg l na 7 4 mg l ca2 3 4 mg l so4 2 3 5 mg l no3 2 9 mg l k 1 1 mg l mg2 1 0 mg l the calculated groundwater concentrations due to rainfall are largely lower than those measured in the aquifer the mathematical resolution of 3 equations system with 3 unknown values leads to the mean participation percentages of each end members to the chemical composition of each sampling point mohammed et al 2014 the isotopic tracers are usually affected by fewer processes than chemical elements in addition the marked altitudinal contrast on the watershed induces contrasted signatures of the stable isotopes of water molecule thus the isotopic data allow a better discrimination of the end members and less ambiguous interpretation of mixing processes the ternary mixing model can be expressed by 1 c sample c l c sc c l f sc c r c l f r c sw c l f sw c sample δ 18 o δ 18 o sc f sc δ 18 o r f r δ 18 o sw f sw c sample hc o 3 c sc hc o 3 f sc c r hc o 3 f r c sw hc o 3 f sw where c cl c δ 18 o and c hc o 3 correspond to the content in cl δ18o and hco3 respectively for each samples and end members schist groundwater sc river water r and seawater sw f is the relative contribution of each end member to groundwater chemistry the results of mixing ratios calculations make it possible to define and quantify the major recharge sources however the mixing model was not sensitive enough to quantify the minor geochemical contribution from local rainfall the model shows that river water is the major contribution for almost all the groundwater sampled on the watershed fig 2b the river water contribution clearly increases from the northern mean value 26 to the southern mean value 72 part the contribution of schist to groundwater from the northern part appears as greatly variable fig 2b from 10 in a1 to 99 in a6 mean of 56 boreholes with a depth lower than 11 m a5 a6 a8 a9 and a10 table 3 and 4 display the most important contribution from schist from 38 to 99 by contrast boreholes with a depth of more than 11 m a1 a3 and a13 a18 display a less important contribution from schist from 10 to 32 with a mean of 25 thus the alluvial aquifer seems vertically stratified in the shallow part groundwater from schistous formations ensures the majority of the recharge the deepest part of the alluvial aquifer is mainly recharged by river water infiltration this vertical subdivision could be explained by the thickness and the degree of the alteration of schistous formation the alteration processes mainly affect the first meters of rock and increase the fissure permeability the aquifer capacity is therefore more developed in the first meters compared to non altered bedrock brgm 1989 1979 and the lateral contribution from schist to groundwater is more important in the shallow part of the alluvial aquifer this vertical subdivision cannot be clearly proven in the southern part because of the shallow depths of the boreholes however regarding the schist contributions of 64 and 23 in the shallowest a21 6 2 m and the deepest a23 23 0 m boreholes respectively the vertical subdivision highlighted in the northern part seems to exist also in the southern part some sampling points a27 a30 and a31 are distinguished by individual behavior fig 2b they display a higher contribution from schist that is not correlated with the trends observed on the surrounding sampling points a27 and a30 are localized close to an artificial drainage channel and or a pumping station the artificial drainage network allows lowering the shallow groundwater level where the schist groundwater contribution is predominant thus schist groundwater represents a large part of the volume of water pumped and rejected into the artificial channels as channels are dug into the ground without waterproofing system water infiltration is facilitated which explains the high contribution from schist groundwater the infiltration of water from artificial drainage network must also be considered in the alluvial aquifer recharge processes reversely a31 is mostly controlled by local geological influences its location at the boundary between schist formations and the alluvial aquifer logically explains the important contribution of schist groundwater to the local recharge groundwater from the sand bar displays an almost equivalent contribution of schist and river water fig 2b this observation highlights the lateral continuity of the alluvial aquifer flowing under the shallow lagoon the 3 points located at the north s1 s2 s3 close to the channel are the most impacted by seawater mixing according to the isotopic data finally the lagoon water results from a mixing between seawater river water and schist lateral contribution the seawater contribution is more important close to the channel directly connected to the sea the sea water percentage progressively decreases while the freshwater percentage i e river water and schist groundwater fig 2b increases as the distance to the channel grows the river water contribution and the lateral contribution from schist groundwater range from 4 to 57 and from 3 to 11 respectively fig 2b among these freshwater supplies the sampling points l2 and l3 show the most important contribution of groundwater from schist formations fig 2b these two sampling points are located in the vicinity of pumping stations which pumped the surface groundwater drained into the artificial channels as groundwater from schistous formations participates mainly in the recharge in the first 10 m of the aquifer it is preferentially drained therefore the contribution of groundwater from schist formations is more important in these two points the mixing model does not allow yet to distinguish river water supplies provided by runoff or having passed through the alluvial aquifer this mixing model confirms the groundwater dependence of the lagoon already highlighted by piezometric data fig 2b but does not allow the exact quantification of the groundwater supplies 4 6 emerging compounds groundwater vulnerability and tracers of ground surface connections 4 6 1 anthropogenic impact and groundwater vulnerability fig 6 displays the spatial distribution of total eocs concentrations distributed all over the alluvial aquifer among the 51 eocs analyzed 44 are detected in significant quantities in sewage from wastewater treatment plan tp1and tp2 fig 1 and sewage lift stations ls1 and ls2 table 1 in the sewage waters the high eocs contents are found together with high mte contents table 5 however only 6 eocs among the 51 analyzed namely ibuprofen paracetamol caffeine paraxanthine cotinine and acesulfam are detected in the natural waters table 5 and fig 7 the set of eocs detected signals anthropogenic pollution due to domestic uses and not from agricultural or industrial contamination the important urbanization of the area seems to represent the main threat for the alluvial aquifer even if the ecos concentrations are very high in sewage water table 5 their concentrations in natural water are relatively low thus the impact on groundwater seems to be currently limited it is also true for the mte especially b al mn fe cu and zn their high concentrations in untreated sewage water are significantly lower in groundwater diluted by the mixing processes groundwater from the sand bar s1 and s6 seems to be the most impacted showing high contents in eocs and mte mn fe zn and as most of the eocs detected have similar properties with notably logkow 4 indicating that the compounds are easily degradable in the environment buser et al 1999 buerge et al 2003 benotti and brownawell 2009 even if persistent pharmaceuticals carbamazepine diclofenac ketoprofen are detected in wastewater at noticeable concentrations table 1 none of them was detected in natural waters table 5 ibuprofen was detected in 100 of samples from ground and surface waters from 23 ng l to 150 ng l table 5 the ibuprofen is the only eocs measured in groundwater from the northern part in contrast groundwater from the southern part is impacted by caffeine 220 ng l paracetamol from 13 ng l to 34 ng l cotinine 61 1 ng l and acesulfam 78 ng l fig 7 the paraxanthine is also detected from 653 ng l to 2210 ng l in samples from the sand bar the omnipresence of ibuprofen brings to light the domestic consumption habits ibuprofen commonly used for various treatments is a cheap over the counter anti inflammatory drug its presence is likely to be related to a significant consumption but also to its persistence in these particular environmental conditions indeed the photodegradation is the dominant attenuation mechanism of this compound in the environment yamamoto et al 2009 araujo et al 2014 however the photodegradation can be a seasonal process and is also very limited within the groundwater suggesting the high potential of ibuprofen infiltrating the alluvial aquifer and persisting in groundwater ibuprofen can therefore be considered as a pharmaceutical fingerprint of this study area finally eocs provide valuable information about the lagoon s vulnerability table 5 even if the groundwater is known to be influenced by anthropogenic contamination erostate et al 2018 no major contamination can be evidenced from geochemical data of the lagoon s water because of the large dilution caused by mixing processes between ground and surface water however eocs are detectable at very low concentrations ng l and eocs contents measured in the lagoon caffeine from 1200 ng l to 1800 ng l paraxanthine from 6390 to 1920 ng l and paracetamol from 19 ng l to 48 ng l highlight the anthropogenic contamination fig 7 ibuprofen detected in all groundwater samples was not found in the lagoon s water fig 7 as previously demonstrated groundwater participates to the fresh water supplies to the lagoon fig 2b the absence of ibuprofen in the lagoon water therefore highlights the occurrence of attenuation processes such as photodegradation and biodegradation the particularly high concentrations of other eocs in the lagoon fig 7 displays that even if they are degradable the quantity of pollutants is too important and or the degradation processes are too low to remove the contamination regarding the ecotoxicity the bioaccumulation capacity of eocs and their impact on living organisms and ecosystems gossett et al 1983 santos et al 2010 the occurrence of micro pollutants in a classified natural reserve site should be considered as a serious concern 4 6 2 ground surface water interaction to highlight the anthropogenic impact and the hydrosystem s vulnerability eocs can also be used to specify ground surface water interactions and then recharge areas of the aquifers sassine et al 2015 zirlewagen et al 2016 labile eocs caffeine paracetamol were previously identified as good tracers of untreated wastewaters of human origin buerge et al 2003 but wwtps is not always the main source of labile pharmaceuticals vystavna et al 2013 these organic compounds can enter the water flow with runoff bartelt hunt et al 2009 and or untreated illegal discharges or in the event of an accident on the wwtps in this study river water displays significant concentrations of ibuprofen 26 ng l caffeine 120 ng l and paracetamol 11 ng l suggesting the impact of sewage water from urban runoff and or overflow of sewage collector fig 7 the sampling points a2 a11 a24 and a31 displays ibuprofen concentrations from 27 ng l to 30 ng l similar to those measured in the river 26 ng l table 5 they also benefit from a high river water contribution 67 to 77 fig 2b thus eocs constitute a complementary tracers to reinforce the established mixing model and to trace surface water inflow the absence of caffeine and paracetamol in groundwater is explained by their relatively fast biodegradation during transport through the subsurface benotti and brownawell 2009 the sampling point a23 is impacted by ibuprofen since it showed the highest concentration 150 ng l table 5 this elevated concentration can be explained by the longer residence time of groundwater tables 3 and 4 allowing the progressive accumulation of ibuprofen into the alluvial aquifer the types of eocs detected also provide qualitative temporal information robertson et al 2013 2016 the information provided by eocs is particularly important in the case of non persistent eocs logkow 4 with a short half life time never exceeding a few months the presence of highly biodegradable compounds such as caffeine or paracetamol indicates the rapid infiltration of contaminated water into the alluvial aquifer if caffeine could be of natural origin buerge et al 2003 paracetamol is a compound of purely human origin well known to be efficiently eliminated by wwtps buser et al 1999 sui et al 2015 its presence thus argues for an untreated sewage contribution wastewater and urban runoff infiltration the high contents in no3 and eocs measured at the sampling point a25 fig 5 and fig 7 and the mixing model fig 2b demonstrate the high infiltration potential of surface water towards the groundwater paracetamol also allows to highlight the rapid flow at the sampling point a21 fig 7 the low contribution of river water rather suggests a contamination from untreated sewage than seepage from septic tanks or leaks from the sanitary network the high concentration in several mte such as al fe ni ba zn and mn also argues in favor of a contamination from untreated sewage this observation is confirmed by the isotopic signatures in δ15n no3 and δ11b previously measured erostate et al 2018 indeed the combination of elevated δ15n no3 values with depleted δ11b signatures suggests systematic contamination by sewage vengosh et al 1994 widory et al 2013 the data on environmental concentration and physical chemical properties of eocs can be useful to provide relevant information about the mechanisms affecting the hydrosystems fig 8 first of all the occurrence of eocs clearly highlights the vulnerability of the hydrosystem to anthropogenic activities thus the spatial extend of the pollution makes it possible to identify pollutant s infiltration areas but also recharge areas of the aquifer sassine et al 2015 zirlewagen et al 2016 the concentrations inform about the level of pollution affecting the resource the archiving capacity of the system or again the potential presence absence of attenuation processes the type of eocs allows the identification of the source of pollution but also provides temporal information robertson et al 2013 2016 the information provided by eocs is particularly important in the case of non persistent eocs with a short half life time the compounds which decompose rapidly will allow to precise the understanding of short times processes such as fast vertical and or lateral infiltration eocs thus provide new complementary information which can support and refine the conclusions resulting from classic chemical and isotopic approach the absence of measurable eocs contamination could also provide information about pristine conditions and remediation processes 4 7 a conceptual model of the hydrosystem behavior a conceptual model of the marana casinca hydrosystem can now be proposed fig 9 the piezometric map fig 2a shows very clearly the groundwater dependence of the lagoon with most of the groundwater s flow oriented from west to east that is to say from the mountain to the lagoon the artificial drainage network clearly affects the hydrodynamic functioning of the alluvial aquifer the drainage channels represent a specified head boundary condition which exacerbates the natural hydraulic gradient of the alluvial aquifer four end members that contribute to the alluvial aquifer were recognized rainfall schist groundwater river water and seawater fig 9 isotope of the water molecule shows that the alluvial aquifer is recharged by rainwater the local recharge by rainfall seems to contribute only slightly to the geochemistry of the alluvial aquifer thus the chemical content of the investigated water bodies mainly depends on the contribution of the 3 other end members the lagoon s water results from groundwater but also from surface water and seawater mixing in very different proportions according to the location on the watershed fig 2b the socio economic activities developing on the marana casinca alluvial plain also impact the groundwater quality the no3 fig 5 and eocs concentrations fig 7 clearly highlight the anthropogenic contamination the detection of highly degradable eocs in groundwater emphasizes the high transmissivity of the alluvial aquifer the alluvial deposits seem to locally favor rapid pollution infiltration towards the aquifer which makes it more vulnerable to anthropogenic pollution jaunat et al 2018 this is particularly true in the southern part of the watershed and on the sand bar in these areas the urbanization is largely developed robert et al 2015 2018 as well as the sanitation network the qualitative degradation of groundwater induced by mixing processes between fresh and salt water seems limited to the freshwater lens in the sand bar fig 2 yet some studies have already shown the vulnerability of the alluvial aquifer to saltwater intrusion in two sectors namely the well field used for bastia s drinking water production a11 a18 and the quarry for aggregates extraction a28 and a29 brgm 2008 1993 the recharge of the alluvial aquifer involves different contributions the northern part of the watershed receives an allochthonous recharge while the southern part benefits mostly from local rainfall fig 3 the recharge brought by rainfall has a limited impact on the groundwater s geochemistry the infiltration of river water and the lateral flow of schist groundwater represent the two major contributors fig 2b their contribution rate varies from the northern part to the southern part but also vertically depending on the depth of the resource the subsurface groundwater from the northern part benefits from a significant lateral recharge from schist groundwater fig 9 the schist contribution decreases toward the southern part and rise as it gets deeper thus the infiltration of river water clearly controls the recharge process fig 2b eocs content allows to confirm the surface water inflow and to precise the rapid lateral and vertical infiltration towards the alluvial aquifer 5 conclusion anthropogenic activities such as groundwater exploitation or artificial drainage networks developed for irrigation or sanitary issues strongly modify the natural behavior of coastal hydrosystems and impact the groundwater quality the appearance and detection of emerging pollutants such as eocs can be very useful for understanding how these hydrosystems behave thanks to the study of their fate in the environment eocs provide new additional information which can support the observations from more common isotopic and chemical tracers in this study the innovative approach of combining geochemical and isotopic data with eocs clearly allows to establish a relevant conceptual model taking into account water rock interactions mixing processes recharge and contamination modalities this new coupling of isotope hydrology geochemical tracers and eocs provide precious information about the short transit time of water and identifies waters recently infiltrated as well as recharge and vulnerability areas this approach can be helpful to understand anthropogenic influences and fast hydrological processes on any strongly anthropized hydrosystem however eocs are still newly studied tracers the progressive improvement in the knowledge of eocs behavior in the environment should help to further precise the temporal quantification of the fast infiltration flows meanwhile in some appropriate cases supplementing this approach by other complementary tracers such as radioactive tracers or atmospheric gases could be helpful to increase the temporal precision of the hydrological processes acknowledgements this work was co funded by the labex driihm french program investissements d avenir anr 11 labx 0010 which is

6107,coastal aquifers can be considered as an important socio economic and ecological component worldwide the implementation of sustainable groundwater management is made difficult by complex hydrological behaviors due to many interactions between groundwater and fresh brackish and salt surface water this study proposes an original multi tracer approach including physico chemical parameters trace elements 18o 2h 3h of the water molecule and emerging organic compounds eocs in order to improve the understanding of strongly urbanized coastal aquifers this methodology was applied to a mediterranean coastal aquifer in northern corsica france firstly the isotopic data allow highlighting the complex recharge of groundwater provided by both allochthonous rainfall from the mountain and autochthonous rainfall on the marana casinca alluvial plain secondly geochemical data coupled with isotopic signatures allow the identification of the different contributors and the quantification of the mixing processes into the aquifer the residence time of groundwater were estimated with 3h in addition to display inertial areas with long residence time 3h also highlights areas subject to infiltration of recent water a better understanding of short time hydrological processes was improved by eocs the study of the fate of eocs in the environment provided a higher level of resolution than geochemical and isotopic tracers alone thus the multi tracing approach using isotopic and geochemical data coupled with the study of the fate of eocs made possible to specify the conceptual model in highly anthropized hydrosystems and particularly fast hydrological processes keywords aquifer lagoon water residence time water mixing groundwater dependent ecosystem corsica 1 introduction coastal aquifers ensure a fundamental role for both anthropogenic activities and environmental preservation they supply a large quantity of freshwater for drinking agricultural and industrial uses in many countries sappa et al 2015 comte et al 2016 they also provide a large part of the fresh water supplies to coastal wetlands consequently referred as groundwater dependent ecosystems gde cartwright and gilfedder 2015 krogulec 2016 menció et al 2017 these sensitive environments play a major ecological role and provide a number of ecosystem services such as food production recreation areas coastal and soil protection and climate regulation de groot et al 2002 rao et al 2015 newton et al 2018 velasco et al 2018 with the global change effects the importance of groundwater supplies should be exacerbated especially in the mediterranean area ipcc 2014 sellami et al 2016 calvache et al 2017 the expected modifications in precipitation patterns aquifer recharge rates and groundwater uses are among the many factors what should greatly impact the groundwater management in coastal areas these predicted disruptions are added to an already very precarious fresh water salt water equilibrium coastal aquifers can be influenced by several fresh and saline water bodies i e groundwater surface water transitional water and seawater the resulting mixing processes between these different water bodies then lead to a complex hydrodynamic behavior the determination and quantification of each end member participation can be assessed by well known indicators such as groundwater geochemical composition prada et al 2015 santoni et al 2016b wang et al 2016 and isotopic signatures liu and yamanaka 2012 gautam et al 2018 however other less commonly applied tracers such as emerging organic pollutants eocs can be helpful to determine the contribution of particular anthropogenic components sewage urban and agricultural runoff into the aquifers lapworth et al 2012 eocs are closely linked to anthropogenic consumption pharmaceuticals domestic use or personal care compounds and its detection in the environment is growing due to the development of analytical tools richardson and ternes 2018 among multiple pathways to the environment the occurrence of eocs in natural waters is mainly related to urban runoff and wastewaters lapworth et al 2012 vystavna et al 2012 sui et al 2015 hence eocs are detectable in every anthropized areas impacted by sewage contamination this is especially true in coastal areas where the rapid urbanization in response to a growing demography small and nicholls 2003 often induces water contamination by septic tank or leakages from sewers dougherty et al 2010 metcalfe et al 2011 del rosario et al 2014 the eocs persistence in natural waters and particularly in groundwater is difficult to constrain due to their largely under investigated behavior in environmental media lapworth et al 2012 according to their own physical and chemical properties some eocs can be exceptionally persistent whereas other can be easily degradable in the environment el shahawi et al 2010 vystavna et al 2013 vystavna et al 2017 to some extent the persistence of eocs can provide useful information on groundwater residence time recharge and mixing processes sassine et al 2015 zirlewagen et al 2016 for example the presence of rapidly degradable eocs will indicate short residence time and recent anthropogenic influence lapworth et al 2018 in contrast the presence of persistent eocs can indicate the archiving and or the low retention capacities of the aquifer the known degradation patterns of eocs can therefore supplement geochemical and isotopic tracers to detail the temporal resolution of hydrological processes the occurrence of eocs is also used to evaluate the infiltration of contaminated and non contaminated surface water into the aquifers and to identify recharge areas sassine et al 2015 the aim of this study is to put forward an innovative approach combining geochemical isotopic data with the fate of emerging compounds in groundwater in order to 1 understand the behavior of anthropized hydrosystems 2 evaluate the anthropogenic impact and 3 precise groundwater surface water interaction and rapid infiltration this study focuses on the marana casinca hydrosystem located in the north east of corsica island france as a representative example of mediterranean socio economic conditions in this coastal hydrosystem the sensitive biguglia coastal lagoon represents the ultimate water collector of a strongly anthropized watershed 2 study area 2 1 geological and hydrological settings the biguglia lagoon is located in the northern part of the corsica island western mediterranean france in the south of the densely urbanized city of bastia fig 1 this shallow brackish coastal lagoon maximum depth of 1 8 m is part of the largest wetland in corsica with a surface of 14 5 km2 located along the coastline the length of the lagoon is around 11 km with a width of up to 2 5 km in the southern part the biguglia lagoon is connected with the tyrrhenian sea by a narrow natural channel at its northern end exchange between the lagoon and the sea water is limited mouillot et al 2000 pasqualini et al 2017 mainly because of sand accumulations that regularly fill and close the channel the lagoon has been classified as natural reserve since 1994 and recognized as a ramsar site in 1991 convention on wetlands of international importance especially as waterfowl habitat 1971 which emphasizes on the international relevance of this study area the region is under a typical mediterranean climate implying large seasonal and inter annual variations of temperatures and precipitations the mean annual temperature and precipitation measured at the bastia météo france station are 15 8 c and 774 mm respectively mean calculated for 1957 2016 the biguglia lagoon watershed is a fairly large area with around 182 km2 and bound to the west and the north by high reliefs until 1450 masl formed by lustrous schist formations fig 1 the southern part of the watershed is formed by the marana casinca alluvial plain the watershed is drained by a major river the bevincu river to the north and several smaller non perennial tributaries only flowing during the rainfall periods besides the golu river which originates at 2525 masl in the hercynian massifs of inner corsica is connected to the lagoon by an artificial channel the marana casinca alluvial plain is composed by quaternary sediment deposits and consists of east to west oriented nested paleo terraces eroded by the two main rivers the golu river and the bevincu river the alluvial terraces were formed during the last glacial phases and were altered during interglacial periods regardless of their age all terraces are composed of gravels pebbles or blocks in a sandy loamy matrix conchon 1972 1978 the marana casinca alluvial plain represents the main aquifer system of the region this shallow alluvial aquifer is constituted by the combination of the two hydraulically connected alluvial aquifers of the bevincu and the golu this aquifer is spread over 80 km2 with a thickness of 3 40 m and a hydraulic conductivity around 10 3 10 4 m s orofino et al 2010 it is mostly developed in the middle and upper wurmian alluvial deposits fy2 and fy3 fig 1 and perched on an impermeable clay deposit layer formed during the lower wurmian fy1 the piezometric map fig 2 a based on piezometric measurements realized in april 2015 clearly shows that groundwater flows towards the lagoon with gradients between 3 and 5 orofino et al 2010 garel et al 2016 thus the alluvial aquifer is a significant source of freshwater for the lagoon making the latter an important coastal gde 2 2 anthropogenic impact the surface hydrology and the natural behavior of the whole hydrosystem are strongly controlled by man made hydraulic infrastructures in the early 20th century an artificial drainage network fig 1 was constructed channels represent a specified head boundary condition and drain the surface groundwater they therefore lower the water table and allow to dry up the marana casinca alluvial plain in order to use the land for agricultural activities and mosquito control then five pumping stations located on the west coast of the lagoon pump the water in the channels when the levels are too high and re allocate this freshwater directly into the lagoon the huge water volumes withdrawn by the pumping stations between 23 mm3 y and 39 mm3 y result from the mixing of fresh groundwater and salt lagoon water consequently estimating the exact groundwater volume extracted from the alluvial aquifer is currently impossible the alluvial aquifer is used for the drinking water supply of bastia s urban area almost 72 000 inhabitants the water demand is increasing simultaneously with the growing urbanization that started in the 1950 s as well as touristic pressure especially during the summer the water volumes pumped for the drinking supply represent about 4 mm3 y national water data bank http www bnpe eaufrance fr over the last century urbanized areas on the catchment have considerably developed the rate of urbanization has particularly increased since the beginning of the 21st century mainly on the marana casinca alluvial plain fox et al 2012 currently the coast of biguglia is one of the french coasts undergoing the highest rate of artificialization robert et al 2018 the sewage mains are located on the marana casinca alluvial plain and these old infrastructures induce many leakages which represent the main pollution source to the alluvial aquifer erostate et al 2018 the treatment efficiency of the sanitation system is strained by the large seasonal fluctuation of wastewater volume because of a highly variable amount of tourists in addition to groundwater the lagoon water quality is also deteriorated due to eutrophication

3 5 aquifer recharge rate estimation the alluvial aquifer recharge rates were computed using the espere v1 5 multiple method excel sheet application lanini et al 2016 the empirical methods of turc and the soil water balance swb method initially proposed by thornthwaite 1948 and improved by dingman 2002 were applied daily rainfall mm temperature c and potential evapotranspiration pet mm provided by météo france rainfall station of bastia for the 01 1957 12 2016 period were used the rainfall composition used to calculate the ionic concentrations supplied by rainfall to groundwater was approximated by the rainfall composition measured in bonifacio nearest station with data along the east coast of corsica from 01 2013 to 12 2014 santoni et al 2018 3 6 end member mixing analysis a ternary mixing model based on geochemical and isotopic composition of groundwater was used to constrain the participation of the different water bodies calculation was carried out using microsoft excel and also checked using the mix2 program vázquez suñé et al 2010 differences between the two approaches were less than 10 4 results and discussion 4 1 aquifer recharge rate estimation the mean annual alluvial aquifer recharge rate is about 127 mm which corresponds to 16 of the 777 mm of mean annual rainfall 01 1957 12 2016 period table 2 this result is consistent with the previously estimated infiltration rates from 9 to 26 for alluvial aquifers in the mediterranean area candela et al 2009 ghiglieri et al 2012 stigter et al 2014 the annual recharge rates display an important inter annual variability table 2 consistent with the western mediterranean context scozzafava and tallini 2001 pulido velazquez et al 2017 santoni et al 2018 the rainfall amount particularly variable from one year to another induces an extremely variable annual aquifer recharge rate ranging from 14 to 427 mm y which represent 3 to 31 of the total annual rainfall respectively table 2 the values of estimated annual aquifer recharge rate also vary from one method to another both turc and swb methods improved by dingman provided similar results with mean inter annual recharge rates between 128 mm and 143 mm the initial swb proposed by thornwaite seems to underestimate the recharge rate 98 mm this method which requires fewer parameters than the swb method improved by dingman and does not take into account snowfall seems less appropriated thereby combining several methods is consequently the best approach to calculate realistic aquifer recharge rate estimations scanlon et al 2006 santoni et al 2018 4 2 groundwater origin the relationships between δ2h and δ18o in groundwater river lagoon and sea water samples are shown in fig 3 the isotopic composition of groundwater ranges from 9 33 to 3 38 for δ18o and from 62 5 to 6 4 for δ2h table 3 and 4 most of the groundwater samples are plotted between the global meteoric water line gmwl craig 1961 and the western mediterranean meteoric water line wmmwl celle jeanton et al 2001 the local meteoric water line for the bastia precipitation bmwl δ2h 7 42 δ18o 9 15 r2 0 95 was also defined using an ordinary least squares regression olsr iaea 1992 for the 12 2013 04 2017 period this water line was proposed considering only non evaporated samples to exclude the effects of sub cloud evaporation froehlich et al 2008 santoni et al 2018 the proposed bmwl is consistent with the wmmwl the local meteoric water line calculated for bonifacio france δ2h 7 39 δ18o 6 03 santoni et al 2018 montpellier france δ2h 7 4 δ18o 7 3 ladouche et al 2009 and sicily italy δ2h 6 75 δ18o 8 2 liotta et al 2013 groundwater from the northern part of the study area is plotted on the bmwl characterized by δ18o between 7 83 and 5 75 and by δ2h between 46 6 and 34 8 fig 3 these depleted signatures close to the annual weighted means of isotopes in rainwater collected in corte central corsica 450 masl 7 3 for δ 18 and 48 for δ2h suggest a recharge from high altitude precipitation huneau et al 2015 thus groundwater from the northern part of the alluvial aquifer benefits from an allochthonous recharge from the headwater catchment essentially formed by lustrous schists groundwater from the southern part of the study area and the sand bar is more enriched in 18o and 2h with values ranging from 7 58 to 3 38 for δ18o and from 46 8 to 6 4 for δ2h fig 3 isotopic signatures are plotted along the bmwl close to the annual weighted mean of isotopes in rainwater collected from the bastia station 1 masl 6 1 f or δ18o and 36 f or δ2h huneau et al 2015 the good correlation between the isotopic values of groundwater and the precipitation collected at bastia rainfall station fig 3 is in favor of a similar meteoric origin and then highlights an autochthonous recharge groundwater from the golu river alluvium a33 fig 1 and from the bevincu river r1 to r5 are more depleted in 18o from 9 33 to 9 13 and from 8 81 to 7 44 respectively and 2h from 62 0 to 59 0 and from 55 9 to 43 9 respectively fig 3 this very depleted signature highlights high altitude water origin from the inner corsica mountainous headwater catchment where the sources of the rivers are located the isotopic composition of groundwater is clearly different from that of the seawater composition 8 6 for δ2h and 1 1 for δ18o the groundwater samples a28 april and september samples a29 and a30 are plotted along the evaporation line the three piezometers are located in a quarry for aggregate building material the extraction leads to a rise in the water table and allows the formation of several small ponds that are subject to evaporation processes groundwater is therefore locally influenced by the re infiltration of this surface water the isotopic signatures of the lagoon water fig 3 indicate mixing processes with seawater the enriched isotopic signatures slightly below the seawater freshwater mixing line also highlight the evaporation processes affecting the lagoon water gemitzi et al 2014 4 3 groundwater quality characterization groundwater temperatures are around 16 7 c tables 3 and 4 close to the mean annual air temperature in bastia s region 15 8 c the lowest temperatures and ec are mainly observed in groundwater close to the rivers the bevincu river the golu river and the pietre turchine river groundwater from the schist formations displays alkaline ph from 7 1 to 7 5 and high ec mean of 884 µs cm tables 3 and 4 the ca2 hco3 water type tends towards a na k water type indicating important interactions with the calcareous schist formations fig 4 groundwater from the northern part is characterized by slightly alkaline ph mean of 7 2 and relatively high ec mean of 536 µs cm tables 3 and 4 the groundwater mineralization is predominantly controlled by high concentrations in calcium magnesium and bicarbonate giving a hco3 ca2 mg2 water type fig 4 their geochemical compositions are generally plotted between the groundwater compositions measured in schist formations and river waters suggesting likewise important mixing processes within the alluvial aquifer fig 5 no3 concentrations are generally low mean 7 mg l tables 3 and 4 which indicates a limited anthropogenic impact groundwater from the southern part is slightly acidic mean ph around 6 9 tables 3 and 4 ec is lower mean of 497 µs cm and its geochemical composition is closer to the river water composition fig 5 the higher concentrations in cl and so4 2 associated with no3 concentrations above the natural baseline between 5 and 7 mg l appelo and postma 2005 santoni et al 2016a b indicate an anthropogenic impact fig 4 finally groundwater from the sand bar and lagoon waters display the highest ec values mean of 2355 µs cm and 35 065 µs cm respectively and high cl na k concentrations tables 3 and 4 suggesting seawater mixing influences s1 s3 and s6 located on the sand bar display significantly high concentrations for most measured metallic trace elements mte especially li and b table 5 suggesting coastal water influence yet the high concentrations in mn fe zn and as up to 220 56 µg l 181 88 µg l 18 93 µg l and 19 55 µg l respectively also suggest the impact of anthropogenic pollution infiltration table 5 4 4 residence time and water rock interaction tritium concentrations range from 1 2 to 4 2 tu with a mean value of 3 1 tu tables 3 and 4 the local 3h content of rain water in about 3 8 tu erostate et al 2018 iaea wmo 2019 groundwater from schist formations sc1 and a23 presents the lowest 3h concentrations with a mean of 1 9 tu and 1 3 tu respectively these low concentrations argue in favour of groundwater with relatively long residence time the sample from the schist formations sc1 indicates the long residence times for water resources from the relatively impervious sediments with minimal connectivity to surface water for the sample point a23 a previous study has already highlighted that this deep well 23 m benefits from a low contribution from recently infiltrated water erostate et al 2018 which explains the low 3h concentration the highest 3h concentrations 5 2 and 4 2 tu are measured in a10 and a33 respectively localized close to the bevincu river and the golu river respectively these high 3h contents tables 3 and 4 and geochemical composition similar to river water composition fig 5 argue in favor of a significant recharge by recently infiltrated water brought by the river finally groundwater from the southern part displays 3h concentrations median value of 3 4 tu higher than those of groundwater from the northern part median value of 2 3 tu therefore groundwater from the southern part presents shorter residence times suggesting a greater contribution of recently infiltrated water to the recharge of the alluvial aquifer chemical composition fig 5 and saturation indices tables 3 and 4 reflect the lithological control on groundwater all groundwater samples are saturated with respect to quartz and or chalcedony the water rock interaction processes involving the schist formations as well as the schistous and granitic nature of alluvial deposits favor the dissolution of chalcedony and quartz minerals groundwater samples are generally undersaturated with respect to carbonate minerals only the saturation indices of groundwater from schist formations sc1 sc2 and sc3 approach saturation with respect to carbonate schist groundwater are enriched in hco3 ca2 na and mg2 in accordance with the nature of the basement mainly constituted by metamorphosed carbonates lahondère et al 1994 the hydrolysis of silicate minerals constituting part of the schistous formations could also locally participate to the observed ionic contents the long residence time of schist groundwater 1 9 tu is in favor of longer interactions with the rock and allows dissolving more minerals leading to an equilibrium with respect to the carbonate minerals and an alkaline ph groundwater from the northern part can be distinguished from that occurring in the southern part by a marked enrichment in hco3 ca2 na and mg2 fig 5 reflecting the predominant influence of schist groundwater in this sector the depletion in hco3 ca2 na and mg2 concentrations from the northern to the southern parts display the progressive decrease in schist groundwater participation the undersaturation with respect to carbonate minerals also suggests a low availability of carbonate minerals and or important mixing processes with low mineralized water the concentrations in cl ca2 na and mg2 measured in the lagoon are in favor of a contribution of both freshwater and seawater the geochemical composition allows the identification of the three water bodies interacting within the alluvial aquifer schist groundwater river water and sea water fig 5 thus particular consideration must be given to the quantification of mixing processes in the alluvial aquifer 4 5 end member characterization and mixing processes taking into account the circulations of water in the alluvial system the chemical composition of groundwater is influenced by four potential end members 1 groundwater from schist formations fig 1 is defined by the mean concentrations in cl hco3 and mean δ18o isotopic signatures measured in sc1 sc2 and sc3 during high flow and low flow conditions this end member is characterized by high hco3 concentrations mean of 409 3 mg l and moderate cl concentrations mean of 39 3 mg l in agreement with the geogenic control the relative depletion in δ18o 7 1 is consistent with the high recharge altitude taking place in the upper part of the watershed 2 river water corresponds to the mean values measured at r1 to r5 this end member is characterized by low concentrations in cl mean value 15 7 mg l and hco3 mean value 167 1 mg l and depleted signature in δ18o mean value 8 1 explained by the high altitude of the source of the rivers 3 seawater is characterized by a very high concentration in cl 21293 9 mg l low concentration in hco3 154 2 mg l and enriched isotopic signature in δ18o 1 1 4 local rainfall is a non negligible natural source of recharge for the aquifer table 2 but contains very low amounts of ions concentrations supplied by rainfall to groundwater can be calculated by using the following equation appelo and postma 2005 2 concentrationfactor p peff w m ions where p represents the total volume of annual precipitation peff refers to the effective rainfall the total volume of annual precipitation the total annual evapotranspiration and wm is the weighted mean of each ionic concentration for the period of measurement the calculation gives the major ions concentrations of the local supply by rainfall hco3 18 1 mg l cl 12 4 mg l na 7 4 mg l ca2 3 4 mg l so4 2 3 5 mg l no3 2 9 mg l k 1 1 mg l mg2 1 0 mg l the calculated groundwater concentrations due to rainfall are largely lower than those measured in the aquifer the mathematical resolution of 3 equations system with 3 unknown values leads to the mean participation percentages of each end members to the chemical composition of each sampling point mohammed et al 2014 the isotopic tracers are usually affected by fewer processes than chemical elements in addition the marked altitudinal contrast on the watershed induces contrasted signatures of the stable isotopes of water molecule thus the isotopic data allow a better discrimination of the end members and less ambiguous interpretation of mixing processes the ternary mixing model can be expressed by 1 c sample c l c sc c l f sc c r c l f r c sw c l f sw c sample δ 18 o δ 18 o sc f sc δ 18 o r f r δ 18 o sw f sw c sample hc o 3 c sc hc o 3 f sc c r hc o 3 f r c sw hc o 3 f sw where c cl c δ 18 o and c hc o 3 correspond to the content in cl δ18o and hco3 respectively for each samples and end members schist groundwater sc river water r and seawater sw f is the relative contribution of each end member to groundwater chemistry the results of mixing ratios calculations make it possible to define and quantify the major recharge sources however the mixing model was not sensitive enough to quantify the minor geochemical contribution from local rainfall the model shows that river water is the major contribution for almost all the groundwater sampled on the watershed fig 2b the river water contribution clearly increases from the northern mean value 26 to the southern mean value 72 part the contribution of schist to groundwater from the northern part appears as greatly variable fig 2b from 10 in a1 to 99 in a6 mean of 56 boreholes with a depth lower than 11 m a5 a6 a8 a9 and a10 table 3 and 4 display the most important contribution from schist from 38 to 99 by contrast boreholes with a depth of more than 11 m a1 a3 and a13 a18 display a less important contribution from schist from 10 to 32 with a mean of 25 thus the alluvial aquifer seems vertically stratified in the shallow part groundwater from schistous formations ensures the majority of the recharge the deepest part of the alluvial aquifer is mainly recharged by river water infiltration this vertical subdivision could be explained by the thickness and the degree of the alteration of schistous formation the alteration processes mainly affect the first meters of rock and increase the fissure permeability the aquifer capacity is therefore more developed in the first meters compared to non altered bedrock brgm 1989 1979 and the lateral contribution from schist to groundwater is more important in the shallow part of the alluvial aquifer this vertical subdivision cannot be clearly proven in the southern part because of the shallow depths of the boreholes however regarding the schist contributions of 64 and 23 in the shallowest a21 6 2 m and the deepest a23 23 0 m boreholes respectively the vertical subdivision highlighted in the northern part seems to exist also in the southern part some sampling points a27 a30 and a31 are distinguished by individual behavior fig 2b they display a higher contribution from schist that is not correlated with the trends observed on the surrounding sampling points a27 and a30 are localized close to an artificial drainage channel and or a pumping station the artificial drainage network allows lowering the shallow groundwater level where the schist groundwater contribution is predominant thus schist groundwater represents a large part of the volume of water pumped and rejected into the artificial channels as channels are dug into the ground without waterproofing system water infiltration is facilitated which explains the high contribution from schist groundwater the infiltration of water from artificial drainage network must also be considered in the alluvial aquifer recharge processes reversely a31 is mostly controlled by local geological influences its location at the boundary between schist formations and the alluvial aquifer logically explains the important contribution of schist groundwater to the local recharge groundwater from the sand bar displays an almost equivalent contribution of schist and river water fig 2b this observation highlights the lateral continuity of the alluvial aquifer flowing under the shallow lagoon the 3 points located at the north s1 s2 s3 close to the channel are the most impacted by seawater mixing according to the isotopic data finally the lagoon water results from a mixing between seawater river water and schist lateral contribution the seawater contribution is more important close to the channel directly connected to the sea the sea water percentage progressively decreases while the freshwater percentage i e river water and schist groundwater fig 2b increases as the distance to the channel grows the river water contribution and the lateral contribution from schist groundwater range from 4 to 57 and from 3 to 11 respectively fig 2b among these freshwater supplies the sampling points l2 and l3 show the most important contribution of groundwater from schist formations fig 2b these two sampling points are located in the vicinity of pumping stations which pumped the surface groundwater drained into the artificial channels as groundwater from schistous formations participates mainly in the recharge in the first 10 m of the aquifer it is preferentially drained therefore the contribution of groundwater from schist formations is more important in these two points the mixing model does not allow yet to distinguish river water supplies provided by runoff or having passed through the alluvial aquifer this mixing model confirms the groundwater dependence of the lagoon already highlighted by piezometric data fig 2b but does not allow the exact quantification of the groundwater supplies 4 6 emerging compounds groundwater vulnerability and tracers of ground surface connections 4 6 1 anthropogenic impact and groundwater vulnerability fig 6 displays the spatial distribution of total eocs concentrations distributed all over the alluvial aquifer among the 51 eocs analyzed 44 are detected in significant quantities in sewage from wastewater treatment plan tp1and tp2 fig 1 and sewage lift stations ls1 and ls2 table 1 in the sewage waters the high eocs contents are found together with high mte contents table 5 however only 6 eocs among the 51 analyzed namely ibuprofen paracetamol caffeine paraxanthine cotinine and acesulfam are detected in the natural waters table 5 and fig 7 the set of eocs detected signals anthropogenic pollution due to domestic uses and not from agricultural or industrial contamination the important urbanization of the area seems to represent the main threat for the alluvial aquifer even if the ecos concentrations are very high in sewage water table 5 their concentrations in natural water are relatively low thus the impact on groundwater seems to be currently limited it is also true for the mte especially b al mn fe cu and zn their high concentrations in untreated sewage water are significantly lower in groundwater diluted by the mixing processes groundwater from the sand bar s1 and s6 seems to be the most impacted showing high contents in eocs and mte mn fe zn and as most of the eocs detected have similar properties with notably logkow 4 indicating that the compounds are easily degradable in the environment buser et al 1999 buerge et al 2003 benotti and brownawell 2009 even if persistent pharmaceuticals carbamazepine diclofenac ketoprofen are detected in wastewater at noticeable concentrations table 1 none of them was detected in natural waters table 5 ibuprofen was detected in 100 of samples from ground and surface waters from 23 ng l to 150 ng l table 5 the ibuprofen is the only eocs measured in groundwater from the northern part in contrast groundwater from the southern part is impacted by caffeine 220 ng l paracetamol from 13 ng l to 34 ng l cotinine 61 1 ng l and acesulfam 78 ng l fig 7 the paraxanthine is also detected from 653 ng l to 2210 ng l in samples from the sand bar the omnipresence of ibuprofen brings to light the domestic consumption habits ibuprofen commonly used for various treatments is a cheap over the counter anti inflammatory drug its presence is likely to be related to a significant consumption but also to its persistence in these particular environmental conditions indeed the photodegradation is the dominant attenuation mechanism of this compound in the environment yamamoto et al 2009 araujo et al 2014 however the photodegradation can be a seasonal process and is also very limited within the groundwater suggesting the high potential of ibuprofen infiltrating the alluvial aquifer and persisting in groundwater ibuprofen can therefore be considered as a pharmaceutical fingerprint of this study area finally eocs provide valuable information about the lagoon s vulnerability table 5 even if the groundwater is known to be influenced by anthropogenic contamination erostate et al 2018 no major contamination can be evidenced from geochemical data of the lagoon s water because of the large dilution caused by mixing processes between ground and surface water however eocs are detectable at very low concentrations ng l and eocs contents measured in the lagoon caffeine from 1200 ng l to 1800 ng l paraxanthine from 6390 to 1920 ng l and paracetamol from 19 ng l to 48 ng l highlight the anthropogenic contamination fig 7 ibuprofen detected in all groundwater samples was not found in the lagoon s water fig 7 as previously demonstrated groundwater participates to the fresh water supplies to the lagoon fig 2b the absence of ibuprofen in the lagoon water therefore highlights the occurrence of attenuation processes such as photodegradation and biodegradation the particularly high concentrations of other eocs in the lagoon fig 7 displays that even if they are degradable the quantity of pollutants is too important and or the degradation processes are too low to remove the contamination regarding the ecotoxicity the bioaccumulation capacity of eocs and their impact on living organisms and ecosystems gossett et al 1983 santos et al 2010 the occurrence of micro pollutants in a classified natural reserve site should be considered as a serious concern 4 6 2 ground surface water interaction to highlight the anthropogenic impact and the hydrosystem s vulnerability eocs can also be used to specify ground surface water interactions and then recharge areas of the aquifers sassine et al 2015 zirlewagen et al 2016 labile eocs caffeine paracetamol were previously identified as good tracers of untreated wastewaters of human origin buerge et al 2003 but wwtps is not always the main source of labile pharmaceuticals vystavna et al 2013 these organic compounds can enter the water flow with runoff bartelt hunt et al 2009 and or untreated illegal discharges or in the event of an accident on the wwtps in this study river water displays significant concentrations of ibuprofen 26 ng l caffeine 120 ng l and paracetamol 11 ng l suggesting the impact of sewage water from urban runoff and or overflow of sewage collector fig 7 the sampling points a2 a11 a24 and a31 displays ibuprofen concentrations from 27 ng l to 30 ng l similar to those measured in the river 26 ng l table 5 they also benefit from a high river water contribution 67 to 77 fig 2b thus eocs constitute a complementary tracers to reinforce the established mixing model and to trace surface water inflow the absence of caffeine and paracetamol in groundwater is explained by their relatively fast biodegradation during transport through the subsurface benotti and brownawell 2009 the sampling point a23 is impacted by ibuprofen since it showed the highest concentration 150 ng l table 5 this elevated concentration can be explained by the longer residence time of groundwater tables 3 and 4 allowing the progressive accumulation of ibuprofen into the alluvial aquifer the types of eocs detected also provide qualitative temporal information robertson et al 2013 2016 the information provided by eocs is particularly important in the case of non persistent eocs logkow 4 with a short half life time never exceeding a few months the presence of highly biodegradable compounds such as caffeine or paracetamol indicates the rapid infiltration of contaminated water into the alluvial aquifer if caffeine could be of natural origin buerge et al 2003 paracetamol is a compound of purely human origin well known to be efficiently eliminated by wwtps buser et al 1999 sui et al 2015 its presence thus argues for an untreated sewage contribution wastewater and urban runoff infiltration the high contents in no3 and eocs measured at the sampling point a25 fig 5 and fig 7 and the mixing model fig 2b demonstrate the high infiltration potential of surface water towards the groundwater paracetamol also allows to highlight the rapid flow at the sampling point a21 fig 7 the low contribution of river water rather suggests a contamination from untreated sewage than seepage from septic tanks or leaks from the sanitary network the high concentration in several mte such as al fe ni ba zn and mn also argues in favor of a contamination from untreated sewage this observation is confirmed by the isotopic signatures in δ15n no3 and δ11b previously measured erostate et al 2018 indeed the combination of elevated δ15n no3 values with depleted δ11b signatures suggests systematic contamination by sewage vengosh et al 1994 widory et al 2013 the data on environmental concentration and physical chemical properties of eocs can be useful to provide relevant information about the mechanisms affecting the hydrosystems fig 8 first of all the occurrence of eocs clearly highlights the vulnerability of the hydrosystem to anthropogenic activities thus the spatial extend of the pollution makes it possible to identify pollutant s infiltration areas but also recharge areas of the aquifer sassine et al 2015 zirlewagen et al 2016 the concentrations inform about the level of pollution affecting the resource the archiving capacity of the system or again the potential presence absence of attenuation processes the type of eocs allows the identification of the source of pollution but also provides temporal information robertson et al 2013 2016 the information provided by eocs is particularly important in the case of non persistent eocs with a short half life time the compounds which decompose rapidly will allow to precise the understanding of short times processes such as fast vertical and or lateral infiltration eocs thus provide new complementary information which can support and refine the conclusions resulting from classic chemical and isotopic approach the absence of measurable eocs contamination could also provide information about pristine conditions and remediation processes 4 7 a conceptual model of the hydrosystem behavior a conceptual model of the marana casinca hydrosystem can now be proposed fig 9 the piezometric map fig 2a shows very clearly the groundwater dependence of the lagoon with most of the groundwater s flow oriented from west to east that is to say from the mountain to the lagoon the artificial drainage network clearly affects the hydrodynamic functioning of the alluvial aquifer the drainage channels represent a specified head boundary condition which exacerbates the natural hydraulic gradient of the alluvial aquifer four end members that contribute to the alluvial aquifer were recognized rainfall schist groundwater river water and seawater fig 9 isotope of the water molecule shows that the alluvial aquifer is recharged by rainwater the local recharge by rainfall seems to contribute only slightly to the geochemistry of the alluvial aquifer thus the chemical content of the investigated water bodies mainly depends on the contribution of the 3 other end members the lagoon s water results from groundwater but also from surface water and seawater mixing in very different proportions according to the location on the watershed fig 2b the socio economic activities developing on the marana casinca alluvial plain also impact the groundwater quality the no3 fig 5 and eocs concentrations fig 7 clearly highlight the anthropogenic contamination the detection of highly degradable eocs in groundwater emphasizes the high transmissivity of the alluvial aquifer the alluvial deposits seem to locally favor rapid pollution infiltration towards the aquifer which makes it more vulnerable to anthropogenic pollution jaunat et al 2018 this is particularly true in the southern part of the watershed and on the sand bar in these areas the urbanization is largely developed robert et al 2015 2018 as well as the sanitation network the qualitative degradation of groundwater induced by mixing processes between fresh and salt water seems limited to the freshwater lens in the sand bar fig 2 yet some studies have already shown the vulnerability of the alluvial aquifer to saltwater intrusion in two sectors namely the well field used for bastia s drinking water production a11 a18 and the quarry for aggregates extraction a28 and a29 brgm 2008 1993 the recharge of the alluvial aquifer involves different contributions the northern part of the watershed receives an allochthonous recharge while the southern part benefits mostly from local rainfall fig 3 the recharge brought by rainfall has a limited impact on the groundwater s geochemistry the infiltration of river water and the lateral flow of schist groundwater represent the two major contributors fig 2b their contribution rate varies from the northern part to the southern part but also vertically depending on the depth of the resource the subsurface groundwater from the northern part benefits from a significant lateral recharge from schist groundwater fig 9 the schist contribution decreases toward the southern part and rise as it gets deeper thus the infiltration of river water clearly controls the recharge process fig 2b eocs content allows to confirm the surface water inflow and to precise the rapid lateral and vertical infiltration towards the alluvial aquifer 5 conclusion anthropogenic activities such as groundwater exploitation or artificial drainage networks developed for irrigation or sanitary issues strongly modify the natural behavior of coastal hydrosystems and impact the groundwater quality the appearance and detection of emerging pollutants such as eocs can be very useful for understanding how these hydrosystems behave thanks to the study of their fate in the environment eocs provide new additional information which can support the observations from more common isotopic and chemical tracers in this study the innovative approach of combining geochemical and isotopic data with eocs clearly allows to establish a relevant conceptual model taking into account water rock interactions mixing processes recharge and contamination modalities this new coupling of isotope hydrology geochemical tracers and eocs provide precious information about the short transit time of water and identifies waters recently infiltrated as well as recharge and vulnerability areas this approach can be helpful to understand anthropogenic influences and fast hydrological processes on any strongly anthropized hydrosystem however eocs are still newly studied tracers the progressive improvement in the knowledge of eocs behavior in the environment should help to further precise the temporal quantification of the fast infiltration flows meanwhile in some appropriate cases supplementing this approach by other complementary tracers such as radioactive tracers or atmospheric gases could be helpful to increase the temporal precision of the hydrological processes acknowledgements this work was co funded by the labex driihm french program investissements d avenir anr 11 labx 0010 which is

6108,electrical resistivity er tomography is a useful nondestructive tool to visualize and estimate moisture content distribution in soil and wood wood er is a function of both moisture and temperature however it is not known yet how the temperature effect should be corrected in order to use er tomography to monitor wood moisture variations this study aims to break this technical barrier the er of three trunk sections of different australian native tree species was measured at varying temperature control experiments and for different moisture contents the results show that wood er

mobility of the ions membrane resistance and capacitance repo 1988 and thus influence resistivity in trees at diel and seasonal time scales yue et al 2018 have examined the effects of seasonal temperature on er of living trees and reported that both seasonal temperature and moisture content have interactive effects on er although it is clear that temperature has an effect on er most published studies have not considered performed temperature correction in the interpretation of resistivity data for trees it is unknown what a kind of temperature correction model is appropriate for er in trees the only study in which the temperature correction was performed is found in mares et al 2016 they employed a linear correction model using the parameters that is commonly used for the soil er correction although the temperature effect and correction models for soil er are well known it is unclear whether the models and their parameter values can be transferred from soil to plants in addition temperature and water are generally coupled in influencing er in trees thus it is important to calibrate the effects of temperature on er measurements especially in order to investigate moisture distribution and movement in tree trunks in this study the primary objectives are 1 to examine the temperature effect on tree er 2 to select an appropriate temperature correction model for tree er and 3 to examine the applicability of using temperature corrected er to estimate wood moisture distribution the investigation is based on tree trunk sections harvested from three selected australian native tree species with emphasis on the er responses to changes in stem temperature and moisture content 2 materials and methods 2 1 electrical resistivity measurements er measurements were conducted by using a multi electrode multichannel resistivity system picus treetronic argus electronic gmbh rostock germany in the laboratory in the college of science and engineering flinders university in this study er tomography was performed on tree trunk sections selected from three australian native tree species table 1 the trunk sections were immediately wrapped with plastic film once it had been harvested to avoid quick moisture loss fig 1 shows the experimental setup for er surveys for each trunk section either 14 or 16 galvanized electrodes 0 2 cm in diameter and 3 cm in length were forced through the bark to sapwood around the circumference in a fixed distance about 2 2 cm see table 1 from one end of the trunk section the number of electrodes spacing among electrodes and electrodes depth into the trunk are shown in table 1 the measuring level was around the middle of the trunk section fig 1a a 2d spatial shape of the trunk at that measuring height free shape was used in this study according to the measured distance between the electrodes was reconstructed with the picus software picus treetronic argus electronics gmbh fig 1b a maximum mesh fineness value of 8 and a default smoothness level of 20 were used to produce the spatial distribution of er with colored triangular based mesh shown in the cross section fig 1b er was measured at a low frequency current of 8 3 hz with a dipole dipole configuration daily et al 1995 an electrical current was passed through two consecutive electrodes in sequence and the resulting electric field was determined by another pair of electrodes in order to obtain a potential difference voltage the recorded electrical potential difference data between electrodes were inverted to obtain the distribution of electrical resistivity based on a finite element simulation günther et al 2006 rücker et al 2006 electrical voltage value was generally set between level 4 and 9 in this study voltage level increased when the trunk became drier we selected different voltage levels to test the tomograph sensitivity and found that there were no or very minor changes 7 in er values when the voltage was increased by one to four levels each measurement resulting in an er image or one dataset was completed within 5 10 min the electrodes setup scheme for each trunk section was kept consistent during the whole study period in order to analyze the effect of stem temperature and moisture on tree er two types of experiments were carried out for the three trunk sections one is the temperature control experiment that is to say resistivity measurements were taken at varying temperatures over a short time e g within 12 h during which wood moisture content is assumed constant the purpose of this experiment was to find out the relationship between er and wood temperature and the data were used to calibrate temperature correction models for each trunk section it was placed into a cold room about 3 c for at least 24 h after that the trunk section was moved into a lab room temperature was set as about 22 c meanwhile er measurements were taken progressively with the rising temperature within the trunk after that the trunk section was placed in a covered black box in a sun exposed open area to increase ambient temperature much above 22 c the box was heated from the sun providing high temperature within stem 35 c for er measurements two cups 100 ml of water were placed in the box to make water vapor within the box approximately saturated so that stem water loss was reduced to a minimum for each trunk section such experiments were performed approximately weekly table 2 with the consideration of changes in stem moisture thus a total of 54 38 and 75 er datasets for trunk sections of e cladocalyx e fasciculosa and a verticillata respectively were obtained the other one is the moisture control experiment here we call moisture control means that the trunk sections were dried naturally at room temperature over a long period e g several weeks during which wood moisture content is assumed to be varying the purpose of this experiment was to analyze the temporal variations of er and the potential effects of moisture changes on the er relating to our third objective for each trunk section er measurements were undertaken daily if possible at room temperature the measurement scheme is shown in table 2 and thus 14 11 and 10 er datasets for trunk sections of e cladocalyx e fasciculosa and a verticillata respectively were obtained in different days during the experimental period to avoid any disturbance for resistivity measurements wood cores were not extracted for measurement of stem moisture content during the experimental period instead the trunk mass was measured approximately daily if possible here we have an assumption that relative moisture loss in sapwood and heartwood area is proportional with the relative mass loss of the whole trunk section there were 17 12 and 10 times of mass measurements for the trunk sections of e cladocalyx e fasciculosa and a verticillata respectively wood cores were taken for moisture measurements at the beginning of the experiment at the end of the experiments wood cores for e fasciculosa and a verticillata were taken from one transect of the trunk where er measurements were taken these data were used to test the relationship between spatial distribution of er and wood moisture the picus q72 software picus treetronic argus electronics gmbh was used to process the observed data which provides er tomograms the resulted image consists of a mesh of triangles each of which is assigned an er value the er tomogram outputs were processed using matlab software mathworks natick ma usa 2 2 in trunk temperature measurements temperature in a trunk section was measured by two thermistors in a heat ratio sapflow meter sfm1 ict international pty ltd australia such a sap flow sensor consists of 3 probes with two temperature measurement probes and one heater probe each temperature probe has a length of 3 5 cm and two thermistors located 0 75 and 2 25 cm from the tip of the probe the 1 5 cm spacing between thermistors is to prevent thermal contamination of the reading in this study only one temperature probe was inserted into the trunk about 5 cm above the electrodes fig 1a here we assume that the temperature distribution is uniform within the sapwood and heartwood area of the trunk thus temperature measured by the outer and inner thermocouples could represent sapwood and heartwood temperature respectively fig 1b each temperature measurement was completed in about 2 min in order to obtain the temperature for the measured er in trunk temperature was recorded in the middle of each er measurement 5 10 min there should be no interactions between temperature and er measurement due to that no heat pulse was released from the temperature probe 2 3 temperature correction models generally an increase in wood temperature results in a decrease in er to take temperature effect into account er measured on a sample tree at a given temperature ρ m can be expressed as a function of a reference resistivity at the reference temperature ρ ref using the following equation 1 ρ m ρ r e f f t where f t is a temperature correction function it is not clear yet which form of correction function f t should be applied for tree er measurements in order to select a proper temperature correction model here we consider three different models for f t a linear model eq 2 denoted as model 1 an exponential model eq 3 denoted as model 2 and a power function model eq 4 denoted as model 3 2 ρ m ρ r e f 1 α t t r e f 3 ρ m ρ r e f e α t r e f t 4 ρ m ρ r e f t r e f t α where ρ m ω m and ρ ref ω m are er at the measurement temperature t c and at the reference temperature t ref c α c 1 is a fitting parameter in this study the reference temperature is set to 25 c thus t ref 25 and only two parameters ρ 25 and α need to be calibrated with measurements the model performance was assessed by using the taylor diagrams which provides a graphically summary of how close the model estimates match observations in terms of their centered root mean square difference rmsd correlation coefficient and standard deviations taylor 2001 the selected optimal correction model and its parameter values were used to convert the measured resistivity to the resistivity at the reference temperature 25 c resistivity for sapwood and heartwood were calibrated respectively based on the parameter values fitted from the experimental data to further examine the applicability of using temperature corrected er to estimate wood moisture variations time series days resistivity data measured at room temperature were used the resistivity difference δρ 25 percentage increase from the initial ρ 25 between two measurements was calculated as follows 5 δ ρ 25 ρ 25 t ρ 25 0 ρ 25 0 100 where ρ 25 0 is the initial er with temperature correction to 25 c ρ 25 t represents the temperature corrected er at time t day from the initial measurement statistical analyses were conducted with the microsoft excel to examine the significance of difference between data comparison of means were performed by using a one way analysis of variance a statistical significance is deemed when p 0 05 3 results 3 1 relationship between electrical resistivity and in trunk temperature fig 2 shows the responses of er to temperature within stem for three trunk sections of different tree species independent of tree species the er exponentially decreases with an increasing temperature over a wide range for sapwood and heartwood temperatures at the same temperature heartwood er is significantly larger than sapwood p 0 05 for the trunk section of e cladocalyx the resistivity measured at a given temperature for sapwood and heartwood on 7 december 2018 is significantly different p 0 05 from that measured at a similar temperature during the subsequent experiments fig 2a and b this difference is very likely due to a large water loss of the trunk section of e cladocalyx between 7 december and 14 december 2018 reflected by the observed mass change however such a difference is not found for the trunk sections of e fasciculosa and a verticillata 3 2 comparison of three temperature correction models the model performance is analyzed with the experimental data measured in different periods for three trunk sections the comparison of the three models is displayed in the taylor diagrams fig 3 based on selected data for each trunk section in most cases the exponential model model 2 gives the highest correlation value and lowest rmsd value a similar result is also found in the remaining experimental data measured during different periods for three species table s1 in the supplementary material these results indicate that model 2 is the best temperature correction model for tree er measurements for the logs harvested from three native vegetation species in south australia 3 3 parameter analysis in this study parameter analysis is performed on the optimal model model 2 and the results are summarized in table 3 for parameter α it slightly varies in a range from 0 0295 to 0 0394 c 1 and from 0 0282 to 0 0437 c 1 for sapwood and heartwood respectively the average α values for sapwood and heartwood are 0 0324 c 1 and 0 0289 c 1 for the trunk section of e cladocalyx 0 0357 c 1 and 0 0417 c 1 for the trunk section of e fasciculosa and 0 0342 c 1 and 0 0311 c 1 for the trunk section of a verticillata there is no significant difference p 0 05 in average α for sapwood among three trunk sections of different tree species while it significantly differs p 0 05 for heartwood among the three tree species this indicates that the sensibility of response for sapwood to temperature is likely to be similar among these three tree species for parameter ρ 25 it slightly varies during different experimental periods but ρ 25 shows significant difference p 0 05 between sapwood and heartwood and among different trunk sections which is likely due to different moisture content between sapwood and heartwood as well as the difference in other properties e g wood density of the trunk sections the temporal variation of resistivity at a reference temperature ρ 25 likely reflects the change of stem moisture content in order to analyze the relationship between ρ 25 and stem moisture ρ 25 is fitted with a constant α averaged from different measurements for each trunk section column 7 10 in table 3 the result shows that the ρ 25 values increase for both sapwood and heartwood as moisture lost reflected by mass loss fig 4 during the experimental period of 2 3 weeks for the trunk sections of e cladocalyx and e fasciculosa here for fig 4 we assume that relative moisture loss in sapwood and heartwood area is proportional to the relative mass loss of the whole trunk section however the ρ 25 values of sapwood and heartwood for the trunk section of a verticillata do not show a similar relationship table 3 and fig 4 this is most likely due to little water loss in the stem section where er measurements were taken reflected by the difference in bark shrink shown in table 1 for the trunk section of a verticillata the bark very likely protected the wood from losing moisture leaving the moisture loss mostly from the two ends at the end of the experiment the trunk section of a verticillata was found to be wetter than the trunk sections of e cladocalyx and e fasciculosa this is also supported by the fact that the ρ 25 values of the trunk section of a verticillata are low and fluctuate within a small range fig 4 3 4 temporal variation of the spatially distributed electrical resistivity at the reference temperature temporal variations of er at the reference temperature 25 c ρ 25 for the three trunk sections are given in figs 5 6 and 7 the initial ρ 25 for the three trunk sections shows a radial decrease from heartwood to the sapwood as well as ρ 25 measured at any other times indicating that heartwood is less electrically conductive than sapwood bark of the trunk however such er pattern cannot be explained by the spatial distribution of wood moisture content alone see figure s1 in supplementary material for the trunk sections of e cladocalyx and e fasciculosa the percentage increase from the initial ρ 25 δ ρ 25 changes significantly over time with larger proportions occurring in sapwood meanwhile the spatial distribution of δ ρ 25 is not uniform within the trunk cross section high values of δ ρ 25 for the trunk section of e cladocalyx are located at the south side of the section with a maximum value of 40 4 on the 16th day after the initial measurement on the 25th day for the trunk section of e fasciculosa δ ρ 25 exceeds 60 for about half of the sapwood area these results indicate that moisture lost over time within the trunk section and most of the moisture loss came from the sapwood area of the stem for the trunk section of a verticillata negative values of δ ρ 25 show in most area of heartwood during the first week of the experiment fig 7b and c which indicates that moisture likely diffused from the sapwood into heartwood thereafter moisture loss started from the sapwood area fig 7c and d fig 8 shows the relationship between the area weighted mean δ ρ 25 and changes in trunk section mass the values of area weighted mean δ ρ 25 for sapwood and heartwood of all the trunk sections significantly p 0 05 increase with the trunk mass loss suggesting that temporal variations of ρ 25 can be used to estimate stem moisture variations 4 discussion 4 1 importance of temperature correction for tree electrical resistivity measurements er is sensitive to variations in temperature and decreases with an increase of trunk temperature for three species in this study such significant effects of temperature on wood er have been reported for several decades stamm 1927 however temperature correction has rarely been performed when er was applied to investigate moisture content in previous studies as temperature within trunk for living trees varies over time correcting temperature effects on tree er is important for interpretation of er variations in this study three temperature correction models are evaluated among which model 2 performs the best in fitting the observation data meanwhile there is no significant difference in values of the parameter α for sapwood among the three tree species and between different moisture conditions this has a profound implication for temperature correction of er measurements and interpretation of moisture change in living trees moisture change and transport within the sapwood has attracted more research interest in hydrology and ecohydrology communities the α value found in this study is larger than that commonly used one in temperature correction models for soil er data see ma et al 2011 for details simply borrowing correction models and parameters from soil er applications could lead to mis interpretation of wood er data this calls for appropriate temperature correction for tree er measurements the results of this study suggest that the exponential model eq 3 is appropriate to correct the effect of temperature on tree er with a parameter α value of 0 034 c 1 for sapwood if no data are available for a specific calibration on the other hand the limitation of this study that in trunk temperature was measured based on one temperature probe at one side of the trunk needs to be noted this may decrease the accuracy of resistivity calibration nevertheless the three trunk sections were placed at room temperature for hours 12 h or days thus in trunk temperature at different side of the trunk should be very similar therefore the impacts of limited temperature measurements on resistivity calibration should be minor in this study however for living trees in the field temperature within the stem cross section can be significantly different both in direction and depth due to variations in incident solar radiation on the tree surface here we suggest that it is better to have temperature measurements at different sides of the tree trunk so that the temperature correction for er of living trees can be performed more reliably alternatively stem heat balance modeling e g potter and andresen 2002 can be used to simulate temperature distribution in stem for er temperature correction in living trees 4 2 implication for wood moisture variation moisture content and temperature within a tree trunk are two important factors influencing er for a given tree species er data on the tree trunk have been used to image moisture distribution in the trunk cross section hagrey 2006 mares et al 2016 suggesting that it is possible to investigate stem moisture variation with time diel and seasonal scale based on the corrected e g temperature effect er measurements in this study the results show different temporal and spatial variations in ρ 25 and δ ρ 25 for the three trunk sections of different tree species figs 5 6 and 7 the temporal variations in ρ 25 are closely associated with wood moisture variation in time while radial difference of er cannot be explained by wood moisture alone however this may not be the situation for living trees in the field because unlike the trunk section in the lab there is water replenishment for sapwood of living trees in any event the relationship between spatial distribution of er and moisture content in the trunk needs to be examined for a given tree species in addition the spatial distribution of δ ρ 25 is not uniform within the trunk cross section this is quite reasonable as moisture generally loses first from sapwood via the bark which can be reflected by those patches of high values of δ ρ 25 for the trunk sections of e cladocalyx and e fasciculosa figs 5 and 6 similar nonuniform changes in resistivity conductivity within tree trunk were also found in ponderosa pine trunk in mares et al 2016 on the other hand moisture within the trunk can diffuse between sapwood and heartwood if there is a certain water potential gradient this may be the situation for the trunk section of a verticillata negative values of δ ρ 25 show in most area of heartwood of the trunk section of a verticillata during the first week of the experiment indicating that moisture likely diffused from sapwood into heartwood therefore the results here highlight that tree er can provide an effective way to monitor moisture changes over time and space in the trunk cross section although moisture content within the trunk is not measured directly for the three trunk sections the increases in resistivity calibrated temperature effect for the three trunk sections over time are closely linked to moisture loss of the trunk fig 8 wu et al 2009 reported that variations in er can reveal water distribution and preferential flow path in a tree trunk moreover gora and yanoviak 2015 found a significant relationship between er and moisture content for four temperate forest trees however the shape of the relationship differed among these species this has some similarity with the result shown in fig 8 in this study it should be noted that tree er depends on several factors including wood moisture density electrolyte content and wood temperature bär et al 2019 vanella et al 2018 one limitation is that there are no measurements of wood density and electrolyte content in this study which may also affect er distribution on the other hand errors caused by different voltage level setting may have influenced er measurements nevertheless we have found that the maximum relative change in er caused by different voltage level was 7 thus the influence of such errors should be minor and does not affect the results of this study in addition it is known that er itself does not tell how much water in the tree trunk but a change of electrical resistivity over time e g δ ρ 25 in this study does tell a gain or loss of wood moisture the advantage of using δ ρ25 is that it removes uncertainties from less time varying factors such as wood properties in er data 5 conclusions in this study we investigated the responses of er to stem temperature for three australian native tree species er exponentially decreases with increasing temperature 5 40 c for all sample wood sections of the three temperature correction models for tree er the exponential model model 2 performs the best in fitting the observation data the parameter α value of this model is relatively constant 0 032 0 036 c 1 for sapwood and it seems to be independent of tree species after temperature correction er reflects temporal distribution of stem moisture for investigation on living trees in the future we suggest that the exponential model be used for temperature correction with a value of 0 034 c 1 for

temperature numerous studies have shown that electrical resistivity conductivity in trees is closely linked to moisture content in wood bär et al 2019 hagrey 2006 mares et al 2016 nadler and tyree 2008 wu et al 2009 which in most cases forms the base for differentiating sapwood from heartwood and detecting wood decay tattar et al 1972 stem temperature affects water and photosynthates translocation in tree trunk and varies significantly if large parts of the stems are exposed to direct sunlight derby and gates 1966 stockfors 2000 reported that the maximum in stem temperature difference was 19 c and 21 5 c for diurnal and seasonal variations respectively for a 30 year old norway spruce tree therefore such significant variations in stem temperature may cause changes in mobility of the ions membrane resistance and capacitance repo 1988 and thus influence resistivity in trees at diel and seasonal time scales yue et al 2018 have examined the effects of seasonal temperature on er of living trees and reported that both seasonal temperature and moisture content have interactive effects on er although it is clear that temperature has an effect on er most published studies have not considered performed temperature correction in the interpretation of resistivity data for trees it is unknown what a kind of temperature correction model is appropriate for er in trees the only study in which the temperature correction was performed is found in mares et al 2016 they employed a linear correction model using the parameters that is commonly used for the soil er correction although the temperature effect and correction models for soil er are well known it is unclear whether the models and their parameter values can be transferred from soil to plants in addition temperature and water are generally coupled in influencing er in trees thus it is important to calibrate the effects of temperature on er measurements especially in order to investigate moisture distribution and movement in tree trunks in this study the primary objectives are 1 to examine the temperature effect on tree er 2 to select an appropriate temperature correction model for tree er and 3 to examine the applicability of using temperature corrected er to estimate wood moisture distribution the investigation is based on tree trunk sections harvested from three selected australian native tree species with emphasis on the er responses to changes in stem temperature and moisture content 2 materials and methods 2 1 electrical resistivity measurements er measurements were conducted by using a multi electrode multichannel resistivity system picus treetronic argus electronic gmbh rostock germany in the laboratory in the college of science and engineering flinders university in this study er tomography was performed on tree trunk sections selected from three australian native tree species table 1 the trunk sections were immediately wrapped with plastic film once it had been harvested to avoid quick moisture loss fig 1 shows the experimental setup for er surveys for each trunk section either 14 or 16 galvanized electrodes 0 2 cm in diameter and 3 cm in length were forced through the bark to sapwood around the circumference in a fixed distance about 2 2 cm see table 1 from one end of the trunk section the number of electrodes spacing among electrodes and electrodes depth into the trunk are shown in table 1 the measuring level was around the middle of the trunk section fig 1a a 2d spatial shape of the trunk at that measuring height free shape was used in this study according to the measured distance between the electrodes was reconstructed with the picus software picus treetronic argus electronics gmbh fig 1b a maximum mesh fineness value of 8 and a default smoothness level of 20 were used to produce the spatial distribution of er with colored triangular based mesh shown in the cross section fig 1b er was measured at a low frequency current of 8 3 hz with a dipole dipole configuration daily et al 1995 an electrical current was passed through two consecutive electrodes in sequence and the resulting electric field was determined by another pair of electrodes in order to obtain a potential difference voltage the recorded electrical potential difference data between electrodes were inverted to obtain the distribution of electrical resistivity based on a finite element simulation günther et al 2006 rücker et al 2006 electrical voltage value was generally set between level 4 and 9 in this study voltage level increased when the trunk became drier we selected different voltage levels to test the tomograph sensitivity and found that there were no or very minor changes 7 in er values when the voltage was increased by one to four levels each measurement resulting in an er image or one dataset was completed within 5 10 min the electrodes setup scheme for each trunk section was kept consistent during the whole study period in order to analyze the effect of stem temperature and moisture on tree er two types of experiments were carried out for the three trunk sections one is the temperature control experiment that is to say resistivity measurements were taken at varying temperatures over a short time e g within 12 h during which wood moisture content is assumed constant the purpose of this experiment was to find out the relationship between er and wood temperature and the data were used to calibrate temperature correction models for each trunk section it was placed into a cold room about 3 c for at least 24 h after that the trunk section was moved into a lab room temperature was set as about 22 c meanwhile er measurements were taken progressively with the rising temperature within the trunk after that the trunk section was placed in a covered black box in a sun exposed open area to increase ambient temperature much above 22 c the box was heated from the sun providing high temperature within stem 35 c for er measurements two cups 100 ml of water were placed in the box to make water vapor within the box approximately saturated so that stem water loss was reduced to a minimum for each trunk section such experiments were performed approximately weekly table 2 with the consideration of changes in stem moisture thus a total of 54 38 and 75 er datasets for trunk sections of e cladocalyx e fasciculosa and a verticillata respectively were obtained the other one is the moisture control experiment here we call moisture control means that the trunk sections were dried naturally at room temperature over a long period e g several weeks during which wood moisture content is assumed to be varying the purpose of this experiment was to analyze the temporal variations of er and the potential effects of moisture changes on the er relating to our third objective for each trunk section er measurements were undertaken daily if possible at room temperature the measurement scheme is shown in table 2 and thus 14 11 and 10 er datasets for trunk sections of e cladocalyx e fasciculosa and a verticillata respectively were obtained in different days during the experimental period to avoid any disturbance for resistivity measurements wood cores were not extracted for measurement of stem moisture content during the experimental period instead the trunk mass was measured approximately daily if possible here we have an assumption that relative moisture loss in sapwood and heartwood area is proportional with the relative mass loss of the whole trunk section there were 17 12 and 10 times of mass measurements for the trunk sections of e cladocalyx e fasciculosa and a verticillata respectively wood cores were taken for moisture measurements at the beginning of the experiment at the end of the experiments wood cores for e fasciculosa and a verticillata were taken from one transect of the trunk where er measurements were taken these data were used to test the relationship between spatial distribution of er and wood moisture the picus q72 software picus treetronic argus electronics gmbh was used to process the observed data which provides er tomograms the resulted image consists of a mesh of triangles each of which is assigned an er value the er tomogram outputs were processed using matlab software mathworks natick ma usa 2 2 in trunk temperature measurements temperature in a trunk section was measured by two thermistors in a heat ratio sapflow meter sfm1 ict international pty ltd australia such a sap flow sensor consists of 3 probes with two temperature measurement probes and one heater probe each temperature probe has a length of 3 5 cm and two thermistors located 0 75 and 2 25 cm from the tip of the probe the 1 5 cm spacing between thermistors is to prevent thermal contamination of the reading in this study only one temperature probe was inserted into the trunk about 5 cm above the electrodes fig 1a here we assume that the temperature distribution is uniform within the sapwood and heartwood area of the trunk thus temperature measured by the outer and inner thermocouples could represent sapwood and heartwood temperature respectively fig 1b each temperature measurement was completed in about 2 min in order to obtain the temperature for the measured er in trunk temperature was recorded in the middle of each er measurement 5 10 min there should be no interactions between temperature and er measurement due to that no heat pulse was released from the temperature probe 2 3 temperature correction models generally an increase in wood temperature results in a decrease in er to take temperature effect into account er measured on a sample tree at a given temperature ρ m can be expressed as a function of a reference resistivity at the reference temperature ρ ref using the following equation 1 ρ m ρ r e f f t where f t is a temperature correction function it is not clear yet which form of correction function f t should be applied for tree er measurements in order to select a proper temperature correction model here we consider three different models for f t a linear model eq 2 denoted as model 1 an exponential model eq 3 denoted as model 2 and a power function model eq 4 denoted as model 3 2 ρ m ρ r e f 1 α t t r e f 3 ρ m ρ r e f e α t r e f t 4 ρ m ρ r e f t r e f t α where ρ m ω m and ρ ref ω m are er at the measurement temperature t c and at the reference temperature t ref c α c 1 is a fitting parameter in this study the reference temperature is set to 25 c thus t ref 25 and only two parameters ρ 25 and α need to be calibrated with measurements the model performance was assessed by using the taylor diagrams which provides a graphically summary of how close the model estimates match observations in terms of their centered root mean square difference rmsd correlation coefficient and standard deviations taylor 2001 the selected optimal correction model and its parameter values were used to convert the measured resistivity to the resistivity at the reference temperature 25 c resistivity for sapwood and heartwood were calibrated respectively based on the parameter values fitted from the experimental data to further examine the applicability of using temperature corrected er to estimate wood moisture variations time series days resistivity data measured at room temperature were used the resistivity difference δρ 25 percentage increase from the initial ρ 25 between two measurements was calculated as follows 5 δ ρ 25 ρ 25 t ρ 25 0 ρ 25 0 100 where ρ 25 0 is the initial er with temperature correction to 25 c ρ 25 t represents the temperature corrected er at time t day from the initial measurement statistical analyses were conducted with the microsoft excel to examine the significance of difference between data comparison of means were performed by using a one way analysis of variance a statistical significance is deemed when p 0 05 3 results 3 1 relationship between electrical resistivity and in trunk temperature fig 2 shows the responses of er to temperature within stem for three trunk sections of different tree species independent of tree species the er exponentially decreases with an increasing temperature over a wide range for sapwood and heartwood temperatures at the same temperature heartwood er is significantly larger than sapwood p 0 05 for the trunk section of e cladocalyx the resistivity measured at a given temperature for sapwood and heartwood on 7 december 2018 is significantly different p 0 05 from that measured at a similar temperature during the subsequent experiments fig 2a and b this difference is very likely due to a large water loss of the trunk section of e cladocalyx between 7 december and 14 december 2018 reflected by the observed mass change however such a difference is not found for the trunk sections of e fasciculosa and a verticillata 3 2 comparison of three temperature correction models the model performance is analyzed with the experimental data measured in different periods for three trunk sections the comparison of the three models is displayed in the taylor diagrams fig 3 based on selected data for each trunk section in most cases the exponential model model 2 gives the highest correlation value and lowest rmsd value a similar result is also found in the remaining experimental data measured during different periods for three species table s1 in the supplementary material these results indicate that model 2 is the best temperature correction model for tree er measurements for the logs harvested from three native vegetation species in south australia 3 3 parameter analysis in this study parameter analysis is performed on the optimal model model 2 and the results are summarized in table 3 for parameter α it slightly varies in a range from 0 0295 to 0 0394 c 1 and from 0 0282 to 0 0437 c 1 for sapwood and heartwood respectively the average α values for sapwood and heartwood are 0 0324 c 1 and 0 0289 c 1 for the trunk section of e cladocalyx 0 0357 c 1 and 0 0417 c 1 for the trunk section of e fasciculosa and 0 0342 c 1 and 0 0311 c 1 for the trunk section of a verticillata there is no significant difference p 0 05 in average α for sapwood among three trunk sections of different tree species while it significantly differs p 0 05 for heartwood among the three tree species this indicates that the sensibility of response for sapwood to temperature is likely to be similar among these three tree species for parameter ρ 25 it slightly varies during different experimental periods but ρ 25 shows significant difference p 0 05 between sapwood and heartwood and among different trunk sections which is likely due to different moisture content between sapwood and heartwood as well as the difference in other properties e g wood density of the trunk sections the temporal variation of resistivity at a reference temperature ρ 25 likely reflects the change of stem moisture content in order to analyze the relationship between ρ 25 and stem moisture ρ 25 is fitted with a constant α averaged from different measurements for each trunk section column 7 10 in table 3 the result shows that the ρ 25 values increase for both sapwood and heartwood as moisture lost reflected by mass loss fig 4 during the experimental period of 2 3 weeks for the trunk sections of e cladocalyx and e fasciculosa here for fig 4 we assume that relative moisture loss in sapwood and heartwood area is proportional to the relative mass loss of the whole trunk section however the ρ 25 values of sapwood and heartwood for the trunk section of a verticillata do not show a similar relationship table 3 and fig 4 this is most likely due to little water loss in the stem section where er measurements were taken reflected by the difference in bark shrink shown in table 1 for the trunk section of a verticillata the bark very likely protected the wood from losing moisture leaving the moisture loss mostly from the two ends at the end of the experiment the trunk section of a verticillata was found to be wetter than the trunk sections of e cladocalyx and e fasciculosa this is also supported by the fact that the ρ 25 values of the trunk section of a verticillata are low and fluctuate within a small range fig 4 3 4 temporal variation of the spatially distributed electrical resistivity at the reference temperature temporal variations of er at the reference temperature 25 c ρ 25 for the three trunk sections are given in figs 5 6 and 7 the initial ρ 25 for the three trunk sections shows a radial decrease from heartwood to the sapwood as well as ρ 25 measured at any other times indicating that heartwood is less electrically conductive than sapwood bark of the trunk however such er pattern cannot be explained by the spatial distribution of wood moisture content alone see figure s1 in supplementary material for the trunk sections of e cladocalyx and e fasciculosa the percentage increase from the initial ρ 25 δ ρ 25 changes significantly over time with larger proportions occurring in sapwood meanwhile the spatial distribution of δ ρ 25 is not uniform within the trunk cross section high values of δ ρ 25 for the trunk section of e cladocalyx are located at the south side of the section with a maximum value of 40 4 on the 16th day after the initial measurement on the 25th day for the trunk section of e fasciculosa δ ρ 25 exceeds 60 for about half of the sapwood area these results indicate that moisture lost over time within the trunk section and most of the moisture loss came from the sapwood area of the stem for the trunk section of a verticillata negative values of δ ρ 25 show in most area of heartwood during the first week of the experiment fig 7b and c which indicates that moisture likely diffused from the sapwood into heartwood thereafter moisture loss started from the sapwood area fig 7c and d fig 8 shows the relationship between the area weighted mean δ ρ 25 and changes in trunk section mass the values of area weighted mean δ ρ 25 for sapwood and heartwood of all the trunk sections significantly p 0 05 increase with the trunk mass loss suggesting that temporal variations of ρ 25 can be used to estimate stem moisture variations 4 discussion 4 1 importance of temperature correction for tree electrical resistivity measurements er is sensitive to variations in temperature and decreases with an increase of trunk temperature for three species in this study such significant effects of temperature on wood er have been reported for several decades stamm 1927 however temperature correction has rarely been performed when er was applied to investigate moisture content in previous studies as temperature within trunk for living trees varies over time correcting temperature effects on tree er is important for interpretation of er variations in this study three temperature correction models are evaluated among which model 2 performs the best in fitting the observation data meanwhile there is no significant difference in values of the parameter α for sapwood among the three tree species and between different moisture conditions this has a profound implication for temperature correction of er measurements and interpretation of moisture change in living trees moisture change and transport within the sapwood has attracted more research interest in hydrology and ecohydrology communities the α value found in this study is larger than that commonly used one in temperature correction models for soil er data see ma et al 2011 for details simply borrowing correction models and parameters from soil er applications could lead to mis interpretation of wood er data this calls for appropriate temperature correction for tree er measurements the results of this study suggest that the exponential model eq 3 is appropriate to correct the effect of temperature on tree er with a parameter α value of 0 034 c 1 for sapwood if no data are available for a specific calibration on the other hand the limitation of this study that in trunk temperature was measured based on one temperature probe at one side of the trunk needs to be noted this may decrease the accuracy of resistivity calibration nevertheless the three trunk sections were placed at room temperature for hours 12 h or days thus in trunk temperature at different side of the trunk should be very similar therefore the impacts of limited temperature measurements on resistivity calibration should be minor in this study however for living trees in the field temperature within the stem cross section can be significantly different both in direction and depth due to variations in incident solar radiation on the tree surface here we suggest that it is better to have temperature measurements at different sides of the tree trunk so that the temperature correction for er of living trees can be performed more reliably alternatively stem heat balance modeling e g potter and andresen 2002 can be used to simulate temperature distribution in stem for er temperature correction in living trees 4 2 implication for wood moisture variation moisture content and temperature within a tree trunk are two important factors influencing er for a given tree species er data on the tree trunk have been used to image moisture distribution in the trunk cross section hagrey 2006 mares et al 2016 suggesting that it is possible to investigate stem moisture variation with time diel and seasonal scale based on the corrected e g temperature effect er measurements in this study the results show different temporal and spatial variations in ρ 25 and δ ρ 25 for the three trunk sections of different tree species figs 5 6 and 7 the temporal variations in ρ 25 are closely associated with wood moisture variation in time while radial difference of er cannot be explained by wood moisture alone however this may not be the situation for living trees in the field because unlike the trunk section in the lab there is water replenishment for sapwood of living trees in any event the relationship between spatial distribution of er and moisture content in the trunk needs to be examined for a given tree species in addition the spatial distribution of δ ρ 25 is not uniform within the trunk cross section this is quite reasonable as moisture generally loses first from sapwood via the bark which can be reflected by those patches of high values of δ ρ 25 for the trunk sections of e cladocalyx and e fasciculosa figs 5 and 6 similar nonuniform changes in resistivity conductivity within tree trunk were also found in ponderosa pine trunk in mares et al 2016 on the other hand moisture within the trunk can diffuse between sapwood and heartwood if there is a certain water potential gradient this may be the situation for the trunk section of a verticillata negative values of δ ρ 25 show in most area of heartwood of the trunk section of a verticillata during the first week of the experiment indicating that moisture likely diffused from sapwood into heartwood therefore the results here highlight that tree er can provide an effective way to monitor moisture changes over time and space in the trunk cross section although moisture content within the trunk is not measured directly for the three trunk sections the increases in resistivity calibrated temperature effect for the three trunk sections over time are closely linked to moisture loss of the trunk fig 8 wu et al 2009 reported that variations in er can reveal water distribution and preferential flow path in a tree trunk moreover gora and yanoviak 2015 found a significant relationship between er and moisture content for four temperate forest trees however the shape of the relationship differed among these species this has some similarity with the result shown in fig 8 in this study it should be noted that tree er depends on several factors including wood moisture density electrolyte content and wood temperature bär et al 2019 vanella et al 2018 one limitation is that there are no measurements of wood density and electrolyte content in this study which may also affect er distribution on the other hand errors caused by different voltage level setting may have influenced er measurements nevertheless we have found that the maximum relative change in er caused by different voltage level was 7 thus the influence of such errors should be minor and does not affect the results of this study in addition it is known that er itself does not tell how much water in the tree trunk but a change of electrical resistivity over time e g δ ρ 25 in this study does tell a gain or loss of wood moisture the advantage of using δ ρ25 is that it removes uncertainties from less time varying factors such as wood properties in er data 5 conclusions in this study we investigated the responses of er to stem temperature for three australian native tree species er exponentially decreases with increasing temperature 5 40 c for all sample wood sections of the three temperature correction models for tree er the exponential model model 2 performs the best in fitting the observation data the parameter α value of this model is relatively constant 0 032 0 036 c 1 for sapwood and it seems to be independent of tree species after temperature correction er reflects temporal distribution of stem moisture for investigation on living trees in the future we suggest that the exponential model be used for temperature correction with a value of 0 034 c 1 for

6109,current concerns and discussions regarding hydraulic fracturing and other activities of the oil and gas industry and geothermal energy sector are forcing a reassessment of formation waters as well as their impacts on the environment in this review paper the chemical and the most important physicochemical properties of low to high salinity formation waters are analysed and critically evaluated especially the complex interactions of the dissolved salts the isotonicity and the relevance of the ph of virgin formation waters are discussed in this context for the first time these by products of the oil and gas industry are presented in a new light whereby a clear distinction made between live and dead formation waters due to this significant differentiation most research results of the past must be critically assessed and reclassified with the highlighted importance of the composition of formation and injection waters the most common causes for early termination of the production phases the possible long term damages to reservoirs and the origin of man made earthquakes are described treatment concepts for dead formation process waters as well as conclusions regarding an environmentally friendly management thereof are mentioned abbreviations rw reservoir formation water rwl live reservoir water rwd dead reservoir water pw produced production water keywords hydrochemistry geochemistry induced seismicity clay swelling oilfield formation water petroleum engineering 1 introduction the identical term formation water or reservoir water rw is not precisely defined scientifically and is used in a variety of ways in the literature where in addition to technical expressions popular expressions have gained acceptance as well the generic term for

waste the objectives of this review are to reveal the very distinct differences between surface and reservoir waters and to expose the multiple but mostly inaccurate definitions of reservoir waters nearly all research results published on formation waters are not dealing with real live reservoir waters rwl but dead reservoir waters rwd therefore the conclusions based on those deficient research have to be reassessed researchers should by observation of the major parameters of rwl be motivated to investigate this unchartered scientific territory at elevated temperatures and under high pressure conditions the repeated production problems due to the ignorance of the differences between rwl and rwd the traditional mindset about the costly water management the duplication of research work as well as the constantly recurring questions about induced seismicity were a strong motivation of this review this paper on the chemical and physicochemical properties of rw and pw is intended to answer the following questions considering the current state of the art what is the technological and environmental significance of the properties of rw and pw for the relevant industries what are the impacts of disregarding the chemical and physicochemical properties of reservoir waters how can dead reservoir waters rwds or production waters pws be treated or disposed of safely can seismic

migration routes fingerprint properties geological anomalies or potential production problems barnaby et al 2004 chaudhuri et al 1987 natural rwl can undergo many reactions throughout geologic periods kleinitz 1976 such as a decrease of co3 2 and hco3 concentrations because of precipitation of sparingly soluble carbonates followed by changes to the ph crabtree et al 1999 hem 1967 meyer et al 2007 otumudia and awajiogak 2016 a depletion of mg2 ions because of dolomitization and the simultaneous replacement with ca2 ions may cause a distinct shift of the original ca2 mg2 ratio bozau et al 2015 hallenberger et al 2018 milde and hähne 1974 furthermore high salt contents of rwl can be attributed to contacts with salt layers bozau et al 2015 worden 1996 and subsequent ion exchange processes with minerals in a reservoir the presence of biophilic elements such as n k b i br often points to the decomposition of organic constituents wright 1963 also a decrease of the so4 2 contents can point to sulphate reducing bacteria frequently introduced by subsequent processes wright 1963a or sulphate precipitates anhydrite the natural decay of uranium and thorium containing minerals in contact with rwl leads to an increase in n o r m of rw 224ra 226ra 228ra 210po 222rn and 210pb bveeg 2010 quite often precipitates settle on the primary mineral surfaces and can thus completely change the original capillary characteristics of a reservoir occurrence of an inner primary and outer secondary mineral composition microscopic surface analyses of core samples in contact with rwl are therefore indispensable throughout geologic time initially present connate water which was trapped in its primary substance during sedimentation as saline brackish or sweet water may have undergone a varied chemical and physicochemical diagenesis such as rwl in contact with sulphide ores e g pyrite yields sulphide waters or free h2s sour gas harper et al 2016 sulphate waters typically originate from layers containing gypsum or anhydrite chloride waters of a wide variety of compositions are known from lower triassic permian muschelkalk tertiary keuper and jurassic formations carle 1963 worden 1996 most geochemical transformations are based on osmosis adsorption and ion exchange processes e g kaolinite smectite as well as the presence of organic substances american petroleum institute 1965a b petrography of unconfined aquifers dilution by meteoric water or an increase in salinity by recent sea water in addition to the 14c age determination of rwl the more reliable 81kr method developed by du et al 2004 may be used today with the aid of this method it has become possible to determine the dwelling times of deep waters in reservoir rocks between 2 104 and 2 106 years and to conduct exact hydrological matching this option for the dating of rwls could also be a useful tool for oil and gas exploration an inspection of the borehole integrity e g inadequate borehole cementing the effectiveness of waterflooding projects as well as the assessment of brine inclusions in salt domes 2 2 classification of reservoir water rws can be divided into six main groups based on their salt content akstinat 1978 see table 2 meyer 1972 attempted to show a specific statistical correlation of rwl with other reservoir data having high significance 90 in a gaussian distribution according to that study the salinities of rwls should be a function of the reservoir temperature initial reservoir pressure and dimensions of a reservoir temperature salinity correlations of rwls are generally known but the other parameters do not permit assertions of such a global nature for example most rwls of austria and southern germany molasse are brackish or of low salinity whereas under very similar reservoir conditions the rwls of northern germany belong to the group of moderate to high salinity waters normally the typical rwl of oil and gas reservoirs may contain the following environmentally relevant but inconvenient constituents additionally volatile aromatic hydrocarbons btex benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylenes 5 10 2 b w of that ca 80 benzene polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pah 10 5 b w heavy metals 5 10 3 b w of that 5 10 6 mercury b w n o r m 10 12 b w and ultrafine mineral materials 50 ppm mean particle size 5 µm tan et al 2017 n o r m occur as unavoidable by products during the production process both as gases and as dissolved salts although this low exposure to radiation is harmless to humans in the case of above ground cooling processes of rwl n o r m often results in precipitations or scales in which these materials accumulate and not infrequently exceed permissible radiation limits such radioactive residues must be monitored and disposed of according to the applicable national radiation protection acts just produced radioactive natural gas is usually temporarily stored in above ground gas tanks to allow the natural radioactivity of the conveyed radon to decay half life 222rn 4 days the gas is then available to end consumers only after a sufficient decay time on average n o r m values based on 226ra for radioactive rwl are only around 8 10 bq kg rwl in comparison with other materials of daily life drinking water 10 3 bq kg cereal products 0 2 bq kg concrete 30 bq kg nuts 40 bq kg bricks 50 bq kg thermal spring water up to 100 bq kg 3 chemical properties compositions and analysis of reservoir water for the most part chemical analyses and modelling approaches of rws are misrepresented in the technical literature and must put in question because most analyses have rarely been carried out on live reservoir water rwl hoth et al 2015 stober et al 2013 2014 proper sampling of rwl is still a difficult and expensive procedure because sampling must be conducted under in situ conditions at reservoir temperature and pressure with special pressurised containers and without contaminations lico et al 1982 the operating or service company performs the first sampling of rwl shortly after exploitation and under reservoir conditions in general those analytical results of a virgin rwl are kept under tight wraps therefore it remains still a challenging issue for any external researcher on formation waters to get hold of detailed compositions of original rwl by permission of the operator usually analyses of aged rwd may be obtained only for this reason most formation water analyses published may be considered as cold water analyses of dead reservoir water rwd in comparison with a sample of rwl most volatile constituents e g h2 he ar rn n2 co2 h2s ch4 and other lower hydrocarbons 1 vol and decomposition products are not considered in rwd hofsäss and kleinitz 2008 even the crucial latency times from the time of sampling to the final analysis procedure are rarely kept constant or documented depending on the type and duration of storage different analytical results may be obtained for the same sample of rwd in some oilfield laboratories it is not rare that interfering precipitates are separated off and discarded without being analysed because such chemical analyses are usually incomplete and inadequate from a scientific point of view published analyses of rw should always be critically judged table 1 highlights the significant differences between rwl and rwd acidic types similar distinctions may be found under alkaline reservoir conditions in the relevant literature this also applies to the literature cited here precise information about the exact sampling the age of the analysed rw samples and the analytical procedures utilised is hardly found therefore inadequate chemical analysis of rwl and rwd pw can lead to severe scaling in pipe systems fig 1 crabtree et al 1999 gates and caraway 1965 otumudia and awajiogak 2016 recalde lummer and willert 2018 and incorrect appraisals of corrosion problems e g type of corrosion cement metal selection of effective corrosion inhibitors additionally deficient assessments of injection water may result in permeability reductions accompanied by inadvertent pressure build up within a reservoir doscher and weber 1957 gates and caraway 1965 likewise the planning implementation and success of secondary or tertiary oil recovery projects ior eor depend strongly on the chemical properties of rwl and rwd pw scarce international research on rwl their very complex ionic compositions and chemical interactions as well as the lack of scientifically sound data have not resulted in reliable deposit and fluid modelling programs error rates 5 for the assessment of the chemical properties of rwl yet complete chemical analyses of rwl and pw are essentials for decisions regarding water treatment reinjection determination the prevailing ion diversity any chemical interaction and into which group a rw must be classified veil et al 2004 due to the geological and mineralogical conditions the types and concentrations of the different ions in rwl may vary significantly even within the same reservoir such variations and interrelations can only be identified by systematic and detailed water analyses programs of reservoir regions and their distinct horizons kölbl 1967 the chemical analysis of rwl is time temperature and pressure dependent immediately after sampling rwls are usually still warm and colourless rwls often become cloudy a brief time later because of the escape of co2 most acidic rwls undergo a pronounced change in co2 equilibrium and there are significant ph shifts in such water samples subsequent oxidation processes caused by atmospheric oxygen and the cooling off of the tempered water samples may result in precipitations e g hydroxide sulphate herdhah and yassin 2009 silicate and carbonate precipitates ostroff 1979 fig 1 this phenomenon is mainly caused by oxidation of fe2 compounds precipitation of fe3 salts usually 10 3 b w and the decomposition of carbonato complexes due to pressure decrease and simultaneous degassing of a rwl when rwl is sampled from deep boreholes various sources of errors must be considered in addition since most boreholes are drilled still using water based drilling muds and such drilling fluids can infiltrate porous layers and remain there contaminations of rwl with drilling fluids and leachates from drill cuttings are always to be expected during the primary production phase abdou et al 2011 collins 1980 proper sampling procedures of rwl and their documentation are therefore of paramount importance accordingly valid rwl analyses are only those analyses that reference to the rwls contained in the permeable drilled formations the differences between rwl and rwd seem to be well known by all those service companies i e schlumberger abdou et al 2011 which are performing downhole sampling and logging in principle all chemical analyses of rw depend mainly on the following parameters ccomponents rw f time latency temperature ph dissolved gases pressure oxygen access especially the poor informative value and futility of the numerous known in part exotic diagrams for characterisation of the chemical compositions of rwl e g cummer hill langelier piper reistle schoeller stiff sulin telkessy tickell ostroff 1979 should be pointed out because the most critical components of rwls are rarely or not at all considered particularly components in low concentrations and trace elements which often have a decisive impact on precipitations or other interactions are generally neglected in these depictions therefore such rudimentary and outdated depictions are suitable for rough technological classifications of salinity only not for an assessment of the real chemical properties of rwls with the aid of modern chemical analysis virtually all elements of the periodic system can be detected in rwl these elements may occur in very different concentration ranges and thus require a variety of analytical methods techniques american petroleum institute api 1965a api 1965b hoke and collins 1980 kramer 1966 lico et al 1982 papazian 1979 ultimately only relatively few ions are present as main constituents in almost all rwls these are the cations na k ca2 mg2 sr2 and ba2 and the anions cl co3 2 and or hco3 and so4 2 generally many other ions may occur in rwls in small quantities only but in some cases these can be of critical importance for different processes concentrations and compositions of the dissolved salts in rwls always depend on the actual capillary contact surfaces of a rwl e g limestone sandstone dolomite clays feldspar granite hem 1967 schröckenfuchs 1975 mineral equilibria ion exchange and precipitation processes e g sr ba so4 and sr ba co3 equilibria also have significant effects on the final composition of rwl bozau et al 2015 herdhah and yassin 2009 truesdell and jones 1968 among other things the following simplified reactions of kaolinite and illite with k ions and quartzitic minerals in a reservoir are responsible for lowering the ph of rwls 3al2si2o5 oh 4 2 k 3kal3sio10 oh 2 3 h2o 2h kaolinite k illite water 2h kal3sio10 oh 2 6sio2 2 k 3kalsi2o8 2h illite quartz potassium feldspar 2h because of clay containing intermediate layers rwls from shale gas reservoirs are predominantly acidic the interactions of the diagenetic changes of rwls during migration show a tendency to produce highly concentrated salt solutions that ultimately contain dissolved nacl and cacl2 only worden 1996 other interesting identifiable characteristics of rwls are that many salts are dissolved far beyond their traditional solubility products supersaturation these are among other things so called salting in effects and interactions with other ions it can also be assumed that there is no complete dissociation of the salts in highly saline solutions or that many ion complexes are present kober 1979 truesdell and jones 1968 almost all acidic rwls also contain fe2 mn2 borate and nh4 ions and on average the br content of rwls are three times greater than their i content kölbl 1967 worden 1996 furthermore all rwls exhibit relatively high sulphate contents however based on numerous water analyses the so4 2 content of rwls seems to be an independent variable without any influence of the regional geology all rwls contain various concentrations of nacl and cacl2 and sub saline to super saline rwls tend to be acidic unusual associates and ion complexes occur in highly concentrated mixed salt solutions barthel et al 2002 ion complexes can represent ion pairs in which a cation retains its hydrate shell unchanged bonds between ions can likewise comply with electrostatic principles or additionally take place via coordination complexes in which one or more water molecule s are still bound to a cation via covalent bonds metal ions of the subgroup elements can form a variety of particular complexes in highly saline solutions kober 1979 sverjensky et al 1997 the structures of aquo carbonato sulphato and chloro metal complexes in highly concentrated mixed salt solutions under high pressures and at elevated temperatures have been investigated very little and remain a challenging scientific field of research with pressure temperature changes and depending on the ph of a rwl for example the decomposition hydrolysis of carbonato complexes to aquo complexes may proceed according to the following reaction zxn co3 h zxn hco3 z x n hc o 3 z x n oh c o 2 h z x n h 2 o depending on the ph of a rwl a condensation of cis aquo complexes in three simplified stages to oh bridged binuclear complexes is to be expected as well kober 1979 zln h2o 2 oh zln oh h2o h2o 2 zln oh h2o zln 2 oh 2 h2o 2 h2o zln 2 oh 2 h2o 2 zln 2 oh 2 2 h2o z central atom l ligand x anion likewise diverse aquo complexes with coordination water of the general composition z h2o n m such as zn h2o 6 2 or fe h2o 6 2 may occur in rwl including the cl and so4 ions most conventional ions in highly saline solutions form multiple ion pairs trace elements and low concentrations of other elements predominantly occur in concentrated mixed salt solutions as coordination complexes such as al h2o 6 3 pb h2o 6 2 and as soluble silico complexes the numerous association compounds between mg2 and so4 2 ions and the unstable carbonato complexes which decompose upon release of pressure and oxygen access are important as well with the simultaneous presence of co2 mostly conventionally known solubility products are no longer valid in highly saline systems and therefore often lead to misinterpretations and incorrect assessments regarding precipitations and deposits occurring during production processes the following ion concentrations can typically be found in rwls 10000 mg l na cl 100 10000 mg l ca2 mg2 k sr2 ba2 so4 2 herdhah and yassin 2009 1 100 mg l al3 fe2 li borates silicates nh4 hco3 co3 2 1 0 01 mg l cr3 cu2 mn2 ni2 sn2 rb titanates zirconates fluorides phosphates etc 0 01 mg l zn2 hg be2 co2 pb2 recalde lummer et al 2018 vanadates tungstates molybdates ga3 ge4 cd2 tl3 y3 ce3 arsenates a variety of n o r m bveeg 2010 etc vo2 v oh 2 v oh 2 cr oh 2 and h2aso4 for example can exist in acidic rwls haso4 2 vo2 oh 2 al oh 4 etc can occur in neutral to weakly alkaline rwls under reservoir conditions mercury usually occurs in rwl in its elemental form rwls differ significantly from surface waters not only in their total concentrations but especially in their ion compositions distinct changes in chemical compositions and physicochemical properties usually occur as the tds content increases 4 physicochemical properties of reservoir water all physicochemical properties of rwls are substantially determined by the temperature gradients concentrations of the dissolved salts and gases and ion exchange of the reservoir components mangelsdorf et al 1970 the temperature of rwls increases with depth the exact amount of this temperature increase is the same neither worldwide nor regionally the depth for a temperature increase by 1 c is defined as the geothermal gradient which in europe is 33 m on average haenel 1979 wohlenberg and haenel 1978 precise knowledge of the reservoir temperatures is a prerequisite for the assessment of most physical and chemical processes in reservoirs as well as the physicochemical properties of rwls e g viscosity density solubilities ph veil et al 2004 the determination of the significant chemical and physicochemical properties of rwl is possible by appropriate downhole sampling equipment i e ops one phase sampler and pvt measurements of those samples collected in an analytical laboratory afterwards a procedure similar to live oil testing abdou et al 2011 the in situ temperature and the cooling off process of a rising rwl in a well can be determined by geophysical borehole measurements temperature log 4 1 density fig 2 shows the density ρ of typical rwds pws as a function of temperature and concentration potter ii and brown 1977 potter ii and clynne 1978 potter ii and haas 1978 the effect of pressure on the density of rws pws is minor under normal conditions and depending on the salinity the densities of typical rws are in the range from 1 003 to 1 250 g cm 3 in situ density measurements of rwls are possible with the aid of geophysical borehole measurements fluid density log 4 2 interfacial surface tension depending on the salinity the surface tensions γ of rwds relative to air are 35 73 mn m 1 and are strongly dependent on temperature colligative properties as well as the types and concentrations of various ions the interfacial tensions γ of rwls towards an oil phase are in the range from 12 21 mn m 1 that is the following influencing factors must be added further to those already mentioned type of oil e g naphthenic aromatic paraffinic and viscosity of the oil akstinat 1978 interfacial tensions substantially affect most flow processes of rwls in the pore space by an addition of suitable surfactants to a rwl as it is done during surfactant flooding interfacial tensions rwl rock metal surfaces oil gas phases can be reduced considerably 10 3 mn m 1 measured by ht hp spinning drop method thus improving the flow of rwl in the pore space i e change of wettability significantly 4 3 electrical conductivity the specific electrical conductivity σ or ϰ in µs cm 1 or ω 1 cm 1 utilising a high frequency alternating current is a highly temperature and concentration dependent variable conductivity measurements are particularly suitable for determining concentrations of low salinity solutions it is not possible to establish generally valid conductivity concentration correlations in high salinity systems such as rwls in which no complete dissociation of salts is to be expected and in which ion associates metal complexes as well as dissolved gases are present in situ measurements at higher temperatures are possible with the aid of geophysical borehole measurements conductivity salinity logs but ultimately only a chemical analysis permits an exact determination of the tds content of rwls measurements of differences in the electrical conductivity salinity changes are particularly suitable for localising inflows into a borehole or checking borehole integrity typical σ values at 20 c are 50 200 µs cm 1 for surface waters 500 2000 µs cm 1 for ground or spring waters 1278 µs cm 1 for 0 74 0 01 m standard kcl solution 50 ms cm 1 for seawater and 85 ms cm 1 for 6 nacl solution for super saline rwl the σ values are usually 100 ms cm 1 in situ conductivity measurements of rwl allow quick and approximate preliminary estimations of salinities only 4 4 viscosity the viscosities of rws are strongly determined by both the temperature and the tds content korsen et al 1969 rws are ideal newtonian fluids their viscosities are close to 1 mpa s 20 2 c depending on their salt content if rwd pw is utilised for eor processes e g polymer flooding or microemulsion flooding its flow behaviour may change significantly usually resulting in a non newtonian fluid with very characteristic flow properties i e thixotropy viscoelasticity 4 5 concentration solubility iso osmoticity both the tds content of rws and the respective ion concentrations of the various salts have a very high significance all precipitation solubility and swelling processes in a reservoir are directly linked to all substances dissolved in a rwl colligative properties therefore the determination of the osmotic pressure of a rwl which is rarely or not at all determined in laboratories is of paramount importance because of the high impact of the osmotic pressure the use application of osmometers is mandatory each injection water must be tested in advance for its osmotic pressure to avoid adverse changes of the thermodynamic equilibrium in a reservoir by diffusion swelling mixing ion exchange processes etc only iso osmotic isotonic waters should be released for reinjection thus to adapt to the colligative properties of a rwl the salinity of injection water may need to be increased or must be diluted with fresh water the solubility of individual salts in rwl is not only strongly temperature dependent but also interdependent on the reservoir pressure and the simultaneous presence of other salts blount 1977 in general salt solubilities in water typically increase as the temperature rises potter ii et al 1977 but exceptionally sparingly soluble salts may show complex solubility anomalies in specific temperature and concentration ranges according to dickey 1968 salt concentrations of rwls should generally increase linearly by 165 mg tds l per meter of depth fig 3 in the vienna basin in contrast it was possible to identify concentration increases of 10 35 mg tds l per meter of depth schröckenfuchs 1975 the ostensible linear conformity of depth to salinity according to dickey 1968 cannot be validated in other regions of the world either but rather represents a rough correlation between salt solubilities and geothermal gradients for some selected american reservoirs and at lower depths only an essential requirement for optimisation of the production processes of oil and gas is the thorough knowledge of all chemical interactions especially when mixing rwds pws of different wells incorrect interpretations of water analyses can result in serious breakdowns precipitations pipe blockages etc barkman and davidson 1972 fu et al 2012 lead salts recalde lummer and willert 2018 sodium sulphate na2so4 calcium sulphate caso4 strontium sulphate srso4 fletcher et al 1982 and barium sulphate baso4 require particular attention the solubility of na2so4 increases up to 32 c and then slowly decreases again this unusual behaviour occurs because in the case of na2so4 two different solids are in equilibrium with the saturated solution below and above 32 c this phenomenon must therefore to be considered both during production and when reinjecting rwds pws the marked solubility decreases of caso4 at 20 c 0 36 at 100 c 0 16 and srso4 at temperatures above 40 c observed by various authors herdhah and yassin 2009 hoth et al 2015 are likewise noteworthy this behaviour of srso4 is explained by the fact that the dissociation of srso4 is an exothermic process baso4 displays similar solubility anomalies in low salinity rwls baso4 solubility passes through a solubility maximum at approximately 120 c fig 4 whereas in highly saline solutions of nacl this maximum is no longer observed fig 5 blount 1977 failure to account for high sr2 and ba2 concentrations in injection water consequently makes permeability reductions due to srso4 baso4 precipitations in the pore space of reservoirs unavoidable especially collins et al 1966 1975 1980 emphasise the importance of the solubility properties of srso4 baso4 in rws furthermore the solubilities of baso4 and srso4 are significantly affected by the simultaneous presence and concentrations of cl hco3 ca2 and mg2 it should be mentioned that contents of 60 mg of baso4 l or 900 mg of srso4 l have been found in different rwls even though their solubility products would have been significantly exceeded herdhah and yassin 2009 astm international 2003 such phenomena must be considered not only during the production of oil and gas but also for the reinjection of treated rwd pw in oil and gas reservoirs as well as water circulation for geothermal projects it is assumed that earth alkali salts of low solubility interact in the presence of high cl concentrations and at elevated temperatures to binary compounds of raised solubilities such as zn so4 n 1cl2 z earth alkali atom n 2 also the reactions of earth alkali sulphates in oilfield brines of high cl concentrations to chloride bridged multicore complexes may be an explanation of their increasing solubilities with rising cl concentrations ion associates in nacl solutions at elevated temperatures and high pressures have been researched by classical molecular dynamics simulations sherman and collings 2002 those theoretical results seem to prove the existence of polyatomic clusters of nanclm n m in pure nacl brines oelkers and helgeson 1993 but an experimental prove in multi component systems like rwl is still outstanding most other anomalies in highly saline rwls at elevated temperatures pressures and different ph values have not been researched yet and are challenging to identify because the multitude of interdependencies in natural systems is quite complicated and still unknown likewise when flooding with micellar and or polymer solutions eor ior the salt content of the rwl and rwd pw as well as the type of salts are crucial to the effectiveness of these enhanced recovery methods high ca2 concentrations and the presence of even very low amounts of heavy metal ions borates and dissolved silicates may cause considerable problems i e precipitation gel formation extensive research by akstinat 1978 has demonstrated this issue in contrast to salt solubilities all gas solubilities in rwls decrease significantly as temperature and salt content increase furthermore the solubility of gases in rwl is strongly pressure dependent in equilibrium the solubilities of gases in rwl are proportional to their partial pressures rassenfoss 2017 4 6 ph the ph of rwl has a very high relevance too it is one of the most critical and sensitive parameters of a reservoir abdou et al 2011 depending on the salinity and the temperature the ph of rwl averages typically between 3 0 and 8 5 20 2 c referring to these values it must be assumed that most ph data of sub saline to super saline rwls stated in the literature are significantly too high because the ph is usually determined on rwd that is under standard conditions 1 bar 25 c all gases potentially influencing the ph and dissolved in rwl would have escaped almost entirely by then at reservoir pressures between 50 and 100 bar and reservoir temperatures from 40 to 60 c about 4 g of co2 already dissolve in 100 g water chapoy et al 2004 dodds et al 1956 wright 1963 fig 6 under these conditions the ph of this type of rw trends towards a constant value of around ph 3 0 at 6 bar already this value is likely also the prevalent ph in most acidic sub saline to super saline rwls crolet and bonis 1983 the significance of the ph stability of rwls is usually underestimated and neglected or completely disregarded abdou et al 2011 yang 2017 however any change of the original ph in a reservoir can lead either to pronounced precipitation or dissolution processes in addition to neutralisation processes e g with crude oil or natural gas constituents changes to the ph of rwl can trigger swelling processes of minerals uncontrollable gas formations sparingly soluble precipitations and unwanted degradation processes in a reservoir the temperature dependent ph of highly saline rwls seems to be very characteristic with values predominantly between 3 3 and 6 5 to achieve ph stability of a rwl or to use a pw rwd to be injected the simultaneous injection of co2 or the utilisation of an appropriate ph buffer would be necessary for acidic rwls a low ph in rwl or pw rwd can cause considerable corrosion damage to casings pipelines cement mantles and other production equipment but these damages can usually be remedied easily by selecting appropriate corrosion inhibitors or materials wright 1963a uncontrolled forced increases of the ph of rwl e g by waterflooding chemical eor processes may lead to significant changes in the chemistry of a reservoir and usually result in a distinct permeability decline of a formation especially close to injection wells mungan 1968 the gases dissolved in rwls are predominantly ch4 co2 n2 h2s collins 1980 and other lower hydrocarbons sulphate reducing bacteria frequently may cause later increasing h2s contents in rwl usually once contaminated a containment of bacteria in oilfield waters is quite cost intensive and partially successful only therefore pw rwds are either treated with chlorine dioxide clo2 or mixed with bactericides before injection as the temperature increases the ph and gas solubilities decrease as is usually the case in the gas analysis of produced reservoir water only the co2 and h2s contents are determined if anything since the co2 equilibrium is a decisive factor for the ph control of rwls it is vitally important to maintain the concentrations of co2 hco3 and co3 2 dissolved in rwls dodds et al 1956 hem 1967 fig 7 5 disposal concepts and environmental issues the disposal of rwds and pws causes considerable problems in certain countries veil et al 2004 regional environmental laws the concerns of citizens initiatives and lack of hydrochemical know how among the approval authorities frequently prevent the injection of rwd into depleted reservoirs or the use of rwd for waterflooding projects if the integrity of a borehole is verified natural products such as adequately treated ph adjusted rwd can usually be returned to their original location the reservoir without any problems however this is not the case for the injection of non isotonic waters with compositions that differ significantly from rwl such as freshwater or mixed production waters stimulation fluids and back flows of hydraulic fracturing processes liquid hazardous substances or brines originating from salt caverns salt mines in the light of those described above the compatibility of injection fluids with a rwl must be examined strictly in advance and have to be adjusted treated accordingly furthermore the significant differences between the above ground and down hole environment must be considered too reservoirs have their own very particular environment and differ significantly from the environmental conditions criteria above ground typical oil and gas reservoirs exhibit high ion exchange capacities or adsorption potentials which can fix or filter out hazardous substances permanently apart of the traditional water treatment of rwds pws and the established re injection of such waters into depleted horizons recently other alternatives for the economical disposal and or utilisation of rwds pws have become a subject of discussion rashid mir et al 2018 rassenfoss 2017 veil et al 2004 because of increasing disposal costs and other limitations jacobs 2016 something that was never seriously considered in the past that is now receiving attention is the pervasive economic use and clean disposal of rwds pws including stimulation fluids back flows and shale waters alzahrani and mohammad 2014 fakhru l razi et al 2009 padaki et al 2015 some waters may contain valuable mineral salts or could if appropriately treated be returned directly to the regular hydrological cycle the first facility for such a complete treatment of highly saline heavy metal and hydrocarbon containing rwds pws is operational in the united states the innovative clearwater facility company antero resources collects centrally and has been converting rwd pw into water that can be is permitted to be reused or introduced into the public sewer system or rivers without any problems the current daily treatment capacity of this new facility is 6400 m3 rwd or pw with a daily salt production of approximately 2000 t the salts thus obtained are intended to be used as de icing agents for roads for the chemical industry chlorine soda production in agriculture and water treatment facilities the processing of rwds pws with high lithium bromine and iodine contents could also be interesting from an economic point of view apart from such positive developments and considerations also negative disposal concepts are well known however it seems that in some oil gas producing countries depleted reservoirs are utilised as low cost dumping sites for any liquid wastewaters by ignoring the most critical physicochemical parameter of iso osmoticity taking this vital criterion not into account an injection of such waters including rwd pw can lead to significant problems in the united states the poorly regulated injection of rwd pw and fracturing wastewater loaded with a chemical mix into depleted reservoirs has raised public concerns for many years already numerous man made earthquakes have been reported mainly in texas kansas and oklahoma due to the uncontrolled disposal of the wastewaters of the oil and gas industry gernon 2018 rubinstein et al 2018 disregarding the osmotic pressure conditions during injection of non adjusted wastewaters into reservoirs with swellable clays i e montmorillonite kaolinite bentonite smectite or mixed clays with anhydrite interstratifications can have severe geomechanical consequences strong imbalances between the osmoticity of rwl and injection waters may trigger among others important interactions swelling processes within a reservoir these time temperature dependant swelling mechanisms and notable pressure increases result either in isostatic pressure adjustments land uplifts or in case of very structured reservoirs in underground or above ground seismic activities gernon 2018 those land uplifts and or man made earthquakes originating from an uncontrolled injection of rwd pw or fracturing waters in exploited reservoirs can depending on the overburden pressure depth create considerable damages on the earth s surface in general all these damages have to be compensated by the perpetrator polluter according to the national mining regulations subsidence damage by oilfield water disposal apart from osmometer measurements a prognosis of these specific seismic events is possible by joint interdisciplinary research work and exchange of reservoir data of hydrogeologists oilfield chemists and geomechanical specialists only a determination of the essential parameters for early predictions such as swelling pressure σ in mpa and swelling parameter α in are available through oedometer measurements on reservoir cores madsen 1979 another negative example of wastewater disposal is the injection of radioactive liquids into depleted reservoirs within the framework of nuclear energy production and scientific studies with radionuclides in research and medicine not insignificant amounts of liquids with usually low level to intermediate level radioactive wastes accumulate among other things this concerns tritiated water which typically contains a wide variety of additional radionuclides in a broad range of concentrations to dispose of these radioactive liquids various experts from the german rsk reactor safety commission and the ssk commission on radiological protection recommended an injection into abandoned depleted reservoirs tritium containing water obtained during reconditioning and waste treatment is to be injected into suitable formations of the deeper subsurface via wells from above ground anonymous 1977 the physicochemical background of this very critical and particularly dangerous disposal method was disregarded or not apparent to these carefree experts similar endeavours from the united states and the former ussr were named to bolster their rationale following known separation and enrichment methods chromatography reservoirs behave like huge separation columns chromatographic separation occurs in such porous media and at the same time dangerous zonal enrichments of individual radionuclides near injection wells may take place with the potentially inadequate borehole integrities of old boreholes and the predominantly long half lives of a variety of radionuclides the creation of an extremely high safety risk for drinking water resources cannot be excluded safe underground final storage of radioactive liquids in depleted reservoirs over the much discussed time of about one million years can be viewed as an illusion only because no generation can provide guarantees of safety over such extended periods 6 relevance of the chemical and physicochemical properties of rw pw on deep drilling technology and the oil and gas production interdisciplinary applied research on rws pws falls within the faculties of geochemistry hydrology and petroleum engineering oilfield chemistry however it is astonishing that this specific topic of oilfield chemistry has not found an adequate scientific home at western universities yet probably applied research on virgin rw is quite complicated due to their numerous variables and interdependencies as well as their expensive equipment for ambitious investigations at elevated temperatures and pressures most known high profile geochemical modelling and theoretical approaches performed under unrealistic conditions are lacking in practical relevance and cannot describe the properties of rwl under typical reservoir conditions helgeson et al 1993 furthermore research and investigations on a profit cutting product like rw pw are not promoted or sponsored by the relevant industries research activities are initiated if and only if severe production problems occur stricter governmental disposal regulations are introduced and disposal costs are escalating further despite their importance rws pws have rarely received the attention they necessarily deserve from petroleum engineers and geochemists in the fields of deep drilling technology oil and gas extraction or geothermal energy the focus of these industries was always oriented towards profitable and not on costly waste products and their disposal however neglecting this area may have significant short term impacts e g massive scale deposits and precipitations blockage of pipe systems al taq et al 2017 doscher and weber 1957 hofsäss and kleinitz 2003 tan et al 2017 veil et al 2004 due to inadequate treatment of the injection waters table 3 indeed pre assessments and compatibility tests could often be made through laboratory investigations al taq et al 2017 tan et al 2017 but ultimately an exact investigation of subsequent reservoir damages are rarely possible as long as rws pws are classified as inconvenient and costly by products of oil and gas production water treatments are pursued only half heartedly such short sighted behaviour of the industry could be excused only from that perspective because the insidious negative consequences of improper rw pw treatments typically become recognisable quite late often only after 5 10 years of injection e g as unknown pressure build up unfavourable oil water ratios when conducting treatment of rwds pws apparent cost cutting measures and lack of hydrochemical knowledge can force a premature abandonment of reservoirs many exhausted oil reservoirs would still be producing profitably today and their residual oil saturation would be significantly reduced if the rwl equilibria had been assessed early and adequately considered kramer 1968 lemcke and tunn 1956 6 1 origin of reservoir damages and production problems due to ignorance of the properties of rw pw the increased significance of the properties of rws for the relevant industries became apparent through an early in depth evaluation of hundreds of rw analyses of german oil and gas reservoirs akstinat 1978 an assessment of international published results and the negative impacts on the injection of poorly treated rwds pws krejci graf 1980 schröckenfuchs 1975 stober et al 2013 2014 as ascertained by the relevant elderly literature cited some basics of the chemical interactions and physicochemical properties of rws pws were already highlighted before 1980 by kleinitz 1976 1977 but have since internationally rarely taken account of rwls with their regionally very different compositions are one of the most chemically sensitive reservoir constituents even small deviations in the equilibrium of rwl are followed by drastic geochemical changes in a reservoir collins 1975 grimm 1962 kirk 1964 kramer 1968 lerman 1978 melrose et al 1976 mungan 1968 weinbrecht 2013 therefore the impact of injection water rwd pw are of primary importance for all waterflooding projects secondary oil recovery al taq et al 2017 fu et al 2012 hofsäss and kleinitz 2003 kleinitz 1976 mahmoud et al 2015 cold water injections waterflooding of untreated or incorrectly conditioned rwds pws may result in damage zones that extend from an injection well relatively far into a reservoir it must be emphasised that rwl has some small overlapping in chemical and physicochemical properties with seawater or near surface groundwaters only in most cases these waters are unsuitable for direct injection into reservoirs a coincidence of rwl with non adapted injection water e g seawater hot water steam flooding surface water of low salinity geothermal projects may result in minimally controllable but harmful side reactions and changes to the ph fig 8 shifting the ph of rwl through injection water to the more basic range always results in an increase in co3 2 ion concentration which may lead to severe precipitations and dissolution of silicates jones et al 1967 weres et al 1979 those silicates may precipitate later at undesirable locations within a reservoir grimm 1962 it should be noted that in acidic rwl ph 7 0 predominantly hco3 ions are present in the alkaline range ph 7 0 co3 2 ions prevail dubessy et al 2005 hem 1967 kleinitz 1976 see fig 7 eventually neither the overall geological nor the mineralogical classification of a reservoir are ultimately the determining factor for interactions with rwls instead the determining factor is exclusively the microscopic surface that is in direct contact with the rwl these capillary contact surfaces can deviate significantly from the overall geological mineralogical composition of a reservoir quite often capillary grain surfaces may be coated with swellable clays sulphates carbonates or na al silicates due to secondary mineralisation difference between inner and outer mineral composition therefore frequently used hydrological groupings based solely on geological data may not allow a pre classification of the original compositions of rwls if a reservoir also contains hydratable clays it may be possible to produce more oil by freshwater seawater flooding initially chillingar 1968 but flooding with fresh or low salinity water generally reduces the permeability due to clay swelling al taq et al 2017 fu et al 2012 hewitt 1963 mahmoud et al 2015 mungan 1968 clay swelling and precipitations of various heavy metal compounds in the pore space are generally accompanied by notable pressure changes in a reservoir particularly during injection of unbalanced pws rwds into a depleted reservoir horizon increased care must always be taken because undesirable conversion reactions of feldspars and clay minerals can occur causes of subsequent reservoir damages detected are widely misinterpreted and explained away as inhomogeneities of a reservoir classified incorrectly or shuffled off as the responsibility of previous generations of engineers blame culture there have been many attempts to repair reservoir damages through chemical treatment methods e g acidising emulsion breaking deflocculation but they usually appear to be successful in the short term and remain unsuccessful in the long term damaged zones can only rarely be permanently repaired by chemical stimulation methods coleman and mclelland 1994 dietzel and kleinitz 1989 hofsäss and kleinitz 2003 kleinitz et al 1976 1977 1998 tan et al 2017 only horizontal drilling that penetrates deep into a reservoir can potentially help to bypass previously damaged zones revive abandoned reservoirs and lead to renewed production 6 2 treatment of rw pw consequently a well planned water treatment program for rwd and pw

ion exchangers zeolites or by introducing atmospheric oxygen and subsequent filtration through gravel sand bed filters kirk 1964 the use of reducing agents to prevent oxidation processes or complexing agents e g citric acid is not recommended because even though above ground problems are solved reversible dilution processes can again lead to precipitations in a reservoir the utilisation of co2 as a protective gas atmosphere in closed systems or a joint injection of co2 into with acidic rwd pw is beneficial as the circulation of pw during waterflooding is continued corrosion problems become increasingly more prevalent due to continuous o2 uptake usually rws and pws contain a series of corrosive components however dissolved oxygen exacerbates corrosion problems corrosion problems are increased additionally by the presence of co2 h2s dubessy et al 2005 and by sulphate reducing bacteria some oil and gas companies use wholly closed systems for the injection water most of these injection waters still contain up to 30 40 ppm fe2 to reduce the harmful effects of atmospheric oxygen inflow and precipitations sometimes reducing agents are added to injection waters in open systems whereby additions of hydrazine are supposed to have a favourable effect 7 conclusions considering the chemical and physicochemical parameters of rws and pws the following recommendations should be observed rwds pws shall be treated and transported in closed systems to prevent oxidation processes and precipitations co2 should be used as a protective gas for acidic rwds pws dubessy et al 2005 the ph of injection waters has to be adjusted to that of the rwl for a simple ph adjustment stabilisation simultaneous injection of co2 is recommended the necessary matching of the isotonicity iso osmoticity with the rwl can be achieved by increasing the salinity or diluting pws with fresh water all the concentrations of heavy metals especially of iron salts in rwds pws should be minimised before reinjection above ground complexing of heavy metal ions is discouraged bacterial contaminations of rwds pws have to be prevented or reduced a prophylactic metered addition of bactericides is recommended most critical discussions about harmful contamination of groundwater or drinking water resources by rwl rwd pw and or other injection liquids usually miss essential vital points quite often occurrences of non comparable near surface reservoir systems odd hydrological processes or human errors are used as hard hitting arguments to fear non specialists and the public scaring keywords i e health hazard human toxicology and carcinogenicity which are used as major objections on various methods used in the oil and gas industry or rwd pw disposal lose significance and environmental relevance upon closer scientific examination in general it can be said that all known environmental toxins and pollutants are already present in our immediate environment in more or less high concentrations presently because of advances in chemical analysis these toxin pollutant concentrations can be detected even in the pico femto range that applies not only for the analysis of drinking water but also for all reservoir constituents the presence of so called hazardous substances toxins in rwds pws etc does not automatically signal acute danger for humans or the environment already the old rule of the dose still applies today all things are poison and nothing is without poison only the dose makes a thing not a poison paracelsus 1589 consequential a measurable effect on humans e g a therapeutic or toxic effect is discernible only once a specific concentration limit is exceeded however this does not mean that a hazardous potential of a substance method should be trivialised or that it should not be warned against something that is rarely considered by concerned citizens or technology opponents is that no technical process can exclude all residual risks that is no less the case for procedures processes of the oil and gas industry declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

6109,current concerns and discussions regarding hydraulic fracturing and other activities of the oil and gas industry and geothermal energy sector are forcing a reassessment of formation waters as well as their impacts on the environment in this review paper the chemical and the most important physicochemical properties of low to high salinity formation waters are analysed and critically evaluated especially the complex interactions of the dissolved salts the isotonicity and the relevance of the ph of virgin formation waters are discussed in this context for the first time these by products of the oil and gas industry are presented in a new light whereby a clear distinction made between live and dead formation waters due to this significant differentiation most research results of the past must be critically assessed and reclassified with the highlighted importance of the composition of formation and injection waters the most common causes for early termination of the production phases the possible long term damages to reservoirs and the origin of man made earthquakes are described treatment concepts for dead formation process waters as well as conclusions regarding an environmentally friendly management thereof are mentioned abbreviations rw reservoir formation water rwl live reservoir water rwd dead reservoir water pw produced production water keywords hydrochemistry geochemistry induced seismicity clay swelling oilfield formation water petroleum engineering 1 introduction the identical term formation water or reservoir water rw is not precisely defined scientifically and is used in a variety of ways in the literature where in addition to technical expressions popular expressions have gained acceptance as well the generic term for this natural product is groundwater however which frequently undifferentiated is used both in the context of surface waters and in hydrological discussions publications related to waters of oil and gas reservoirs deep drilling technologies as well as geothermal projects there are mainly two major groups for which an assessment classification is usually carried out in advance group a drinking water groundwater thermal water fresh water mineral water and spring water group b formation or reservoir water sub divided in live virgin formation reservoir water rwl and dead formation reservoir water rwd deep water subsurface water connate water and especially in the oil and gas industry produced or production water pw houston 2007 veil et al 2004 injection water oilfield water or brines flood water shale water fracking water back flow olson et al 2013 vengosh et al 2014 vidic et al 2013 rwls are natural virgin waters that occur during drilling operations oil and gas explorations as well as underground storage freely movable rwls are thus typically encountered at depths 1000 m bottom hole pressures bhp of 100 bar and bottom hole temperatures bht 50 c haenel 1979 wohlenberg and haenel 1978 once such a virgin live formation reservoir water rwl is rising to and sampled at the wellhead its composition will change continuously with temperature pressure and time to the new equilibrium of a dead reservoir water rwd such an equilibrium state will be reached after about 1 to 3 days above ground and at standard conditions 1 bar 25 c generally the terms produced water or production water pw are not defined properly abdou et al 2011 veil et al 2004 a since the latency time between sampling and analysis of reservoir water are not mentioned in most of the relevant literature produced water may describe freshly sampled reservoir water at the wellhead not at equilibrium as well as aged dead reservoir water rwd at equilibrium b the definition of production water or injection water is even more complex and relates to all those waters which are utilized in production processes waterflooding eor ior etc production waters may be saline reservoir waters covered already under a mixtures of high salinity reservoir waters from different reservoir horizons or various wells treated reservoir water as well as seawater in special processes cases i e hydraulic fracturing well treatments even fresh water is utilized as production water the resulting back flows reservoir water plus chemical mix have to be treated specifically or disposed safely as dangerous waste the objectives of this review are to reveal the very distinct differences between surface and reservoir waters and to expose the multiple but mostly inaccurate definitions of reservoir waters nearly all research results published on formation waters are not dealing with real live reservoir waters rwl but dead reservoir waters rwd therefore the conclusions based on those deficient research have to be reassessed researchers should by observation of the major parameters of rwl be motivated to investigate this unchartered scientific territory at elevated temperatures and under high pressure conditions the repeated production problems due to the ignorance of the differences between rwl and rwd the traditional mindset about the costly water management the duplication of research work as well as the constantly recurring questions about induced seismicity were a strong motivation of this review this paper on the chemical and physicochemical properties of rw and pw is intended to answer the following questions considering the current state of the art what is the technological and environmental significance of the properties of rw and pw for the relevant industries what are the impacts of disregarding the chemical and physicochemical properties of reservoir waters how can dead reservoir waters rwds or production waters pws be treated or disposed of safely can seismic activities earthquakes originate from an injection of production waters pws into depleted reservoirs increased environmental awareness among the public the activities of local forums and environmental organisations groups have raised numerous questions and revealed sensitive areas of concern to rws and pws that have been left unacknowledged or neglected in the past as well as the present buch 2015 with an increasing demand for explanations and transparency it comes as no surprise that many self proclaimed specialists and scientists from outside this subject area make themselves heard and put forth sometimes questionable statements this scientific vacuum in oilfield chemistry has also left the oil and gas industry embarrassed and hard pressed for explanations as a result there are emotional discussions among the public about feared contamination of drinking water resources due to new activities of the oil and gas industry or geothermal projects anonymous 1995 2009 carle 1963 kleinitz and menz 1977 rosenwinkel et al 2012 vidic et al 2013 furthermore even a general distrust is raised against many traditional technologies of the oil and gas industry the surrendering of essential tasks and technical knowledge which should fall to the oil and gas industry to service companies subcontractors who only rarely are willing to reveal their acquired technical expertise is now having significant consequences the lack of in depth chemical knowledge of the responsible parties regarding the exact specifications of the liquids chemicals used for hydraulic fracturing and stimulation processes and the compositions of the back flow anonymous 2014 olson et al 2013 rosenwinkel et al 2012 sherman and collings 2002 vidic et al 2013 have indisputably focused on the controversial debates on the protection of drinking water resources and issues of borehole integrity buch 2015 the consequential damages from ingress of rws or pws into swelling clay and or anhydrite

oil reservoirs or salt caverns have caused further suspicions the pressure on and requirement for more transparency from the oil and gas companies as well as drilling operators regarding the chemical and physicochemical properties of rw drilling muds and produced fluids waters have therefore increased significantly 2 reservoir water natural rwl of oil and gas reservoirs in europe are typically highly mineralised bozau et al 2015 hofsäss and kleinitz 2008 hölting 1969 hoth et al 2015 kleinitz 1976 kleinitz and menz 1977 lehmann 1974a b lemcke and tunn 1956 michel 1965 müller 1969 rüddiger 1963 stober et al 2013 2014 zieschang 1974 whereby even total dissolved solids tds 300 g l is known according to an evaluation of hundreds of rw analyses by akstinat 1978 average salinities predominantly lie within a range of 100 to 150 g l in addition to the tds in rwl the ion isotope compositions and ion ratios collins 1980 harper et al 2016 kölbl 1967 müller et al 1966 presence and type of dissolved gases the reservoir pressure and temperature as well as the ph crolet and bonis 1983 play a primary role in the interpretation of various reactions in oil and gas reservoirs on the other hand the types and quantities of entrained solids the viscosity and the naturally occurring radioactive materials n o r m of rwls are of secondary importance among the other properties of rwls bveeg 2010 2 1 genesis and origin of reservoir water rwls are oxygen free deep formation waters which regarding geologic time typically migrated into their respective reservoir rocks deposits afterwards these deep waters differ significantly in their chemical compositions and physicochemical properties from the much researched near surface groundwaters carle 1963 houston 2007 often the chemical compositions of rwls provide information about their regional genesis and origin such that indications of their migration paths into or out of a reservoir can frequently be obtained from chemical analysis data alone carpenter 1978 hölting 1969 hoth et al 2015 kölbl 1967 lehmann 1974a b michel 1965 milde and hähne 1974 rumeau and sourisse 1975 schröckenfuchs 1975 stober et al 2013 2014 zaytsev 1968 in general the overall salinity tds is rarely a key for classification but rather the ion isotope ratios barnaby et al 2004 chaudhuri et al 1987 collins 1980 müller et al 1966 and the concentration of the minor components trace elements that are determinative coustau 1977 rumeau and sourisse 1975 even though the ionic compositions of rwl can vary considerably along with their migration routes migration paths as well as the dimensions and interconnections of aquifers can be determined and studied with the aid of tracer tests isotopic analyses barnaby et al 2004 guizerix et al 1974 mairhofer 1967 stumpf et al 2018 in addition to specific ion isotope ratios the presence of different trace elements in rwl opens significant rarely used opportunities for clarification of migration routes fingerprint properties geological anomalies or potential production problems barnaby et al 2004 chaudhuri et al 1987 natural rwl can undergo many reactions throughout geologic periods kleinitz 1976 such as a decrease of co3 2 and hco3 concentrations because of precipitation of sparingly soluble carbonates followed by changes to the ph crabtree et al 1999 hem 1967 meyer et al 2007 otumudia and awajiogak 2016 a depletion of mg2 ions because of dolomitization and the simultaneous replacement with ca2 ions may cause a distinct shift of the original ca2 mg2 ratio bozau et al 2015 hallenberger et al 2018 milde and hähne 1974 furthermore high salt contents of rwl can be attributed to contacts with salt layers bozau et al 2015 worden 1996 and subsequent ion exchange processes with minerals in a reservoir the presence of biophilic elements such as n k b i br often points to the decomposition of organic constituents wright 1963 also a decrease of the so4 2 contents can point to sulphate reducing bacteria frequently introduced by subsequent processes wright 1963a or sulphate precipitates anhydrite the natural decay of uranium and thorium containing minerals in contact with rwl leads to an increase in n o r m of rw 224ra 226ra 228ra 210po 222rn and 210pb bveeg 2010 quite often precipitates settle on the primary mineral surfaces and can thus completely change the original capillary characteristics of a reservoir occurrence of an inner primary and outer secondary mineral composition microscopic surface analyses of core samples in contact with rwl are therefore indispensable throughout geologic time initially present connate water which was trapped in its primary substance during sedimentation as saline brackish or sweet water may have undergone a varied chemical and physicochemical diagenesis such as rwl in contact with sulphide ores e g pyrite yields sulphide waters or free h2s sour gas harper et al 2016 sulphate waters typically originate from layers containing gypsum or anhydrite chloride waters of a wide variety of compositions are known from lower triassic permian muschelkalk tertiary keuper and jurassic formations carle 1963 worden 1996 most geochemical transformations are based on osmosis adsorption and ion exchange processes e g kaolinite smectite as well as the presence of organic substances american petroleum institute 1965a b petrography of unconfined aquifers dilution by meteoric water or an increase in salinity by recent sea water in addition to the 14c age determination of rwl the more reliable 81kr method developed by du et al 2004 may be used today with the aid of this method it has become possible to determine the dwelling times of deep waters in reservoir rocks between 2 104 and 2 106 years and to conduct exact hydrological matching this option for the dating of rwls could also be a useful tool for oil and gas exploration an inspection of the borehole integrity e g inadequate borehole cementing the effectiveness of waterflooding projects as well as the assessment of brine inclusions in salt domes 2 2 classification of reservoir water rws can be divided into six main groups based on their salt content akstinat 1978 see table 2 meyer 1972 attempted to show a specific statistical correlation of rwl with other reservoir data having high significance 90 in a gaussian distribution according to that study the salinities of rwls should be a function of the reservoir temperature initial reservoir pressure and dimensions of a reservoir temperature salinity correlations of rwls are generally known but the other parameters do not permit assertions of such a global nature for example most rwls of austria and southern germany molasse are brackish or of low salinity whereas under very similar reservoir conditions the rwls of northern germany belong to the group of moderate to high salinity waters normally the typical rwl of oil and gas reservoirs may contain the following environmentally relevant but inconvenient constituents additionally volatile aromatic hydrocarbons btex benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylenes 5 10 2 b w of that ca 80 benzene polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pah 10 5 b w heavy metals 5 10 3 b w of that 5 10 6 mercury b w n o r m 10 12 b w and ultrafine mineral materials 50 ppm mean particle size 5 µm tan et al 2017 n o r m occur as unavoidable by products during the production process both as gases and as dissolved salts although this low exposure to radiation is harmless to humans in the case of above ground cooling processes of rwl n o r m often results in precipitations or scales in which these materials accumulate and not infrequently exceed permissible radiation limits such radioactive residues must be monitored and disposed of according to the applicable national radiation protection acts just produced radioactive natural gas is usually temporarily stored in above ground gas tanks to allow the natural radioactivity of the conveyed radon to decay half life 222rn 4 days the gas is then available to end consumers only after a sufficient decay time on average n o r m values based on 226ra for radioactive rwl are only around 8 10 bq kg rwl in comparison with other materials of daily life drinking water 10 3 bq kg cereal products 0 2 bq kg concrete 30 bq kg nuts 40 bq kg bricks 50 bq kg thermal spring water up to 100 bq kg 3 chemical properties compositions and analysis of reservoir water for the most part chemical analyses and modelling approaches of rws are misrepresented in the technical literature and must put in question because most analyses have rarely been carried out on live reservoir water rwl hoth et al 2015 stober et al 2013 2014 proper sampling of rwl is still a difficult and expensive procedure because sampling must be conducted under in situ conditions at reservoir temperature and pressure with special pressurised containers and without contaminations lico et al 1982 the operating or service company performs the first sampling of rwl shortly after exploitation and under reservoir conditions in general those analytical results of a virgin rwl are kept under tight wraps therefore it remains still a challenging issue for any external researcher on formation waters to get hold of detailed compositions of original rwl by permission of the operator usually analyses of aged rwd may be obtained only for this reason most formation water analyses published may be considered as cold water analyses of dead reservoir water rwd in comparison with a sample of rwl most volatile constituents e g h2 he ar rn n2 co2 h2s ch4 and other lower hydrocarbons 1 vol and decomposition products are not considered in rwd hofsäss and kleinitz 2008 even the crucial latency times from the time of sampling to the final analysis procedure are rarely kept constant or documented depending on the type and duration of storage different analytical results may be obtained for the same sample of rwd in some oilfield laboratories it is not rare that interfering precipitates are separated off and discarded without being analysed because such chemical analyses are usually incomplete and inadequate from a scientific point of view published analyses of rw should always be critically judged table 1 highlights the significant differences between rwl and rwd acidic types similar distinctions may be found under alkaline reservoir conditions in the relevant literature this also applies to the literature cited here precise information about the exact sampling the age of the analysed rw samples and the analytical procedures utilised is hardly found therefore inadequate chemical analysis of rwl and rwd pw can lead to severe scaling in pipe systems fig 1 crabtree et al 1999 gates and caraway 1965 otumudia and awajiogak 2016 recalde lummer and willert 2018 and incorrect appraisals of corrosion problems e g type of corrosion cement metal selection of effective corrosion inhibitors additionally deficient assessments of injection water may result in permeability reductions accompanied by inadvertent pressure build up within a reservoir doscher and weber 1957 gates and caraway 1965 likewise the planning implementation and success of secondary or tertiary oil recovery projects ior eor depend strongly on the chemical properties of rwl and rwd pw scarce international research on rwl their very complex ionic compositions and chemical interactions as well as the lack of scientifically sound data have not resulted in reliable deposit and fluid modelling programs error rates 5 for the assessment of the chemical properties of rwl yet complete chemical analyses of rwl and pw are essentials for decisions regarding water treatment reinjection determination the prevailing ion diversity any chemical interaction and into which group a rw must be classified veil et al 2004 due to the geological and mineralogical conditions the types and concentrations of the different ions in rwl may vary significantly even within the same reservoir such variations and interrelations can only be identified by systematic and detailed water analyses programs of reservoir regions and their distinct horizons kölbl 1967 the chemical analysis of rwl is time temperature and pressure dependent immediately after sampling rwls are usually still warm and colourless rwls often become cloudy a brief time later because of the escape of co2 most acidic rwls undergo a pronounced change in co2 equilibrium and there are significant ph shifts in such water samples subsequent oxidation processes caused by atmospheric oxygen and the cooling off of the tempered water samples may result in precipitations e g hydroxide sulphate herdhah and yassin 2009 silicate and carbonate precipitates ostroff 1979 fig 1 this phenomenon is mainly caused by oxidation of fe2 compounds precipitation of fe3 salts usually 10 3 b w and the decomposition of carbonato complexes due to pressure decrease and simultaneous degassing of a rwl when rwl is sampled from deep boreholes various sources of errors must be considered in addition since most boreholes are drilled still using water based drilling muds and such drilling fluids can infiltrate porous layers and remain there contaminations of rwl with drilling fluids and leachates from drill cuttings are always to be expected during the primary production phase abdou et al 2011 collins 1980 proper sampling procedures of rwl and their documentation are therefore of paramount importance accordingly valid rwl analyses are only those analyses that reference to the rwls contained in the permeable drilled formations the differences between rwl and rwd seem to be well known by all those service companies i e schlumberger abdou et al 2011 which are performing downhole sampling and logging in principle all chemical analyses of rw depend mainly on the following parameters ccomponents rw f time latency temperature ph dissolved gases pressure oxygen access especially the poor informative value and futility of the numerous known in part exotic diagrams for characterisation of the chemical compositions of rwl e g cummer hill langelier piper reistle schoeller stiff sulin telkessy tickell ostroff 1979 should be pointed out because the most critical components of rwls are rarely or not at all considered particularly components in low concentrations and trace elements which often have a decisive impact on precipitations or other interactions are generally neglected in these depictions therefore such rudimentary and outdated depictions are suitable for rough technological classifications of salinity only not for an assessment of the real chemical properties of rwls with the aid of modern chemical analysis virtually all elements of the periodic system can be detected in rwl these elements may occur in very different concentration ranges and thus require a variety of analytical methods techniques american petroleum institute api 1965a api 1965b hoke and collins 1980 kramer 1966 lico et al 1982 papazian 1979 ultimately only relatively few ions are present as main constituents in almost all rwls these are the cations na k ca2 mg2 sr2 and ba2 and the anions cl co3 2 and or hco3 and so4 2 generally many other ions may occur in rwls in small quantities only but in some cases these can be of critical importance for different processes concentrations and compositions of the dissolved salts in rwls always depend on the actual capillary contact surfaces of a rwl e g limestone sandstone dolomite clays feldspar granite hem 1967 schröckenfuchs 1975 mineral equilibria ion exchange and precipitation processes e g sr ba so4 and sr ba co3 equilibria also have significant effects on the final composition of rwl bozau et al 2015 herdhah and yassin 2009 truesdell and jones 1968 among other things the following simplified reactions of kaolinite and illite with k ions and quartzitic minerals in a reservoir are responsible for lowering the ph of rwls 3al2si2o5 oh 4 2 k 3kal3sio10 oh 2 3 h2o 2h kaolinite k illite water 2h kal3sio10 oh 2 6sio2 2 k 3kalsi2o8 2h illite quartz potassium feldspar 2h because of clay containing intermediate layers rwls from shale gas reservoirs are predominantly acidic the interactions of the diagenetic changes of rwls during migration show a tendency to produce highly concentrated salt solutions that ultimately contain dissolved nacl and cacl2 only worden 1996 other interesting identifiable characteristics of rwls are that many salts are dissolved far beyond their traditional solubility products supersaturation these are among other things so called salting in effects and interactions with other ions it can also be assumed that there is no complete dissociation of the salts in highly saline solutions or that many ion complexes are present kober 1979 truesdell and jones 1968 almost all acidic rwls also contain fe2 mn2 borate and nh4 ions and on average the br content of rwls are three times greater than their i content kölbl 1967 worden 1996 furthermore all rwls exhibit relatively high sulphate contents however based on numerous water analyses the so4 2 content of rwls seems to be an independent variable without any influence of the regional geology all rwls contain various concentrations of nacl and cacl2 and sub saline to super saline rwls tend to be acidic unusual associates and ion complexes occur in highly concentrated mixed salt solutions barthel et al 2002 ion complexes can represent ion pairs in which a cation retains its hydrate shell unchanged bonds between ions can likewise comply with electrostatic principles or additionally take place via coordination complexes in which one or more water molecule s are still bound to a cation via covalent bonds metal ions of the subgroup elements can form a variety of particular complexes in highly saline solutions kober 1979 sverjensky et al 1997 the structures of aquo carbonato sulphato and chloro metal complexes in highly concentrated mixed salt solutions under high pressures and at elevated temperatures have been investigated very little and remain a challenging scientific field of research with pressure temperature changes and depending on the ph of a rwl for example the decomposition hydrolysis of carbonato complexes to aquo complexes may proceed according to the following reaction zxn co3 h zxn hco3 z x n hc o 3 z x n oh c o 2 h z x n h 2 o depending on the ph of a rwl a condensation of cis aquo complexes in three simplified stages to oh bridged binuclear complexes is to be expected as well kober 1979 zln h2o 2 oh zln oh h2o h2o 2 zln oh h2o zln 2 oh 2 h2o 2 h2o zln 2 oh 2 h2o 2 zln 2 oh 2 2 h2o z central atom l ligand x anion likewise diverse aquo complexes with coordination water of the general composition z h2o n m such as zn h2o 6 2 or fe h2o 6 2 may occur in rwl including the cl and so4 ions most conventional ions in highly saline solutions form multiple ion pairs trace elements and low concentrations of other elements predominantly occur in concentrated mixed salt solutions as coordination complexes such as al h2o 6 3 pb h2o 6 2 and as soluble silico complexes the numerous association compounds between mg2 and so4 2 ions and the unstable carbonato complexes which decompose upon release of pressure and oxygen access are important as well with the simultaneous presence of co2 mostly conventionally known solubility products are no longer valid in highly saline systems and therefore often lead to misinterpretations and incorrect assessments regarding precipitations and deposits occurring during production processes the following ion concentrations can typically be found in rwls 10000 mg l na cl 100 10000 mg l ca2 mg2 k sr2 ba2 so4 2 herdhah and yassin 2009 1 100 mg l al3 fe2 li borates silicates nh4 hco3 co3 2 1 0 01 mg l cr3 cu2 mn2 ni2 sn2 rb titanates zirconates fluorides phosphates etc 0 01 mg l zn2 hg be2 co2 pb2 recalde

vo2 oh 2 al oh 4 etc can occur in neutral to weakly alkaline rwls under reservoir conditions mercury usually occurs in rwl in its elemental form rwls differ significantly from surface waters not only in their total concentrations but especially in their ion compositions distinct changes in chemical compositions and physicochemical properties usually occur as the tds content increases 4 physicochemical properties of reservoir water all physicochemical properties of rwls are substantially determined by the temperature gradients concentrations of the dissolved salts and gases and ion exchange of the reservoir components mangelsdorf et al 1970 the temperature of rwls increases with depth the exact amount of this temperature increase is the same neither worldwide nor regionally the depth for a temperature increase by 1 c is defined as the geothermal gradient which in europe is 33 m on average haenel 1979 wohlenberg and haenel 1978 precise knowledge of the reservoir temperatures is a prerequisite for the assessment of most physical and chemical processes in reservoirs as well as the physicochemical properties of rwls e g viscosity density solubilities ph veil et al 2004 the determination of the significant chemical and physicochemical properties of rwl is possible by appropriate downhole sampling equipment i e ops one phase sampler and pvt measurements of those samples collected in an analytical laboratory afterwards a procedure similar to live oil testing abdou et al 2011 the in situ temperature and the cooling off process of a rising rwl in a well can be determined by geophysical borehole measurements temperature log 4 1 density fig 2 shows the density ρ of typical rwds pws as a function of temperature and concentration potter ii and brown 1977 potter ii and clynne 1978 potter ii and haas 1978 the effect of pressure on the density of rws pws is minor under normal conditions and depending on the salinity the densities of typical rws are in the range from 1 003 to 1 250 g cm 3 in situ density measurements of rwls are possible with the aid of geophysical borehole measurements fluid density log 4 2 interfacial surface tension depending on the salinity the surface tensions γ of rwds relative to air are 35 73 mn m 1 and are strongly dependent on temperature colligative properties as well as the types and concentrations of various ions the interfacial tensions γ of rwls towards an oil phase are in the range from 12 21 mn m 1 that is the following influencing factors must be added further to those already mentioned type of oil e g naphthenic aromatic paraffinic and viscosity of the oil akstinat 1978 interfacial tensions substantially affect most flow processes of rwls in the pore space by an addition of suitable surfactants to a rwl as it is done during surfactant flooding interfacial tensions rwl rock metal surfaces oil gas phases can be reduced considerably 10 3 mn m 1 measured by ht hp spinning drop method thus improving the flow of rwl in the pore space i e change of wettability significantly 4 3 electrical conductivity the specific electrical conductivity σ or ϰ in µs cm 1 or ω 1 cm 1 utilising a high frequency alternating current is a highly temperature and concentration dependent variable conductivity measurements are particularly suitable for determining concentrations of low salinity solutions it is not possible to establish generally valid conductivity concentration correlations in high salinity systems such as rwls in which no complete dissociation of salts is to be expected and in which ion associates metal complexes as well as dissolved gases are present in situ measurements at higher temperatures are possible with the aid of geophysical borehole measurements conductivity salinity logs but ultimately only a chemical analysis permits an exact determination of the tds content of rwls measurements of differences in the electrical conductivity salinity changes are particularly suitable for localising inflows into a borehole or checking borehole integrity typical σ values at 20 c are 50 200 µs cm 1 for surface waters 500 2000 µs cm 1 for ground or spring waters 1278 µs cm 1 for 0 74 0 01 m standard kcl solution 50 ms cm 1 for seawater and 85 ms cm 1 for 6 nacl solution for super saline rwl the σ values are usually 100 ms cm 1 in situ conductivity measurements of rwl allow quick and approximate preliminary estimations of salinities only 4 4 viscosity the viscosities of rws are strongly determined by both the temperature and the tds content korsen et al 1969 rws are ideal newtonian fluids their viscosities are close to 1 mpa s 20 2 c depending on their salt content if rwd pw is utilised for eor processes e g polymer flooding or microemulsion flooding its flow behaviour may change significantly usually resulting in a non newtonian fluid with very characteristic flow properties i e thixotropy viscoelasticity 4 5 concentration solubility iso osmoticity both the tds content of rws and the respective ion concentrations of the various salts have a very high significance all precipitation solubility and swelling processes in a reservoir are directly linked to all substances dissolved in a rwl colligative properties therefore the determination of the osmotic pressure of a rwl which is rarely or not at all determined in laboratories is of paramount importance because of the high impact of the osmotic pressure the use application of osmometers is mandatory each injection water must be tested in advance for its osmotic pressure to avoid adverse changes of the thermodynamic equilibrium in a reservoir by diffusion swelling mixing ion exchange processes etc only iso osmotic isotonic waters should be released for reinjection thus to adapt to the colligative properties of a rwl the salinity of injection water may need to be increased or must be diluted with fresh water the solubility of individual salts in rwl is not only strongly temperature dependent but also interdependent on the reservoir pressure and the simultaneous presence of other salts blount 1977 in general salt solubilities in water typically increase as the temperature rises potter ii et al 1977 but exceptionally sparingly soluble salts may show complex solubility anomalies in specific temperature and concentration ranges according to dickey 1968 salt concentrations of rwls should generally increase linearly by 165 mg tds l per meter of depth fig 3 in the vienna basin in contrast it was possible to identify concentration increases of 10 35 mg tds l per meter of depth schröckenfuchs 1975 the ostensible linear conformity of depth to salinity according to dickey 1968 cannot be validated in other regions of the world either but rather represents a rough correlation between salt solubilities and geothermal gradients for some selected american reservoirs and at lower depths only an essential requirement for optimisation of the production processes of oil and gas is the thorough knowledge of all chemical interactions especially when mixing rwds pws of different wells incorrect interpretations of water analyses can result in serious breakdowns precipitations pipe blockages etc barkman and davidson 1972 fu et al 2012 lead salts recalde lummer and willert 2018 sodium sulphate na2so4 calcium sulphate caso4 strontium sulphate srso4 fletcher et al 1982 and barium sulphate baso4 require particular attention the solubility of na2so4 increases up to 32 c and then slowly decreases again this unusual behaviour occurs because in the case of na2so4 two different solids are in equilibrium with the saturated solution below and above 32 c this phenomenon must therefore to be considered both during production and when reinjecting rwds pws the marked solubility decreases of caso4 at 20 c 0 36 at 100 c 0 16 and srso4 at temperatures above 40 c observed by various authors herdhah and yassin 2009 hoth et al 2015 are likewise noteworthy this behaviour of srso4 is explained by the fact that the dissociation of srso4 is an exothermic process baso4 displays similar solubility anomalies in low salinity rwls baso4 solubility passes through a solubility maximum at approximately 120 c fig 4 whereas in highly saline solutions of nacl this maximum is no longer observed fig 5 blount 1977 failure to account for high sr2 and ba2 concentrations in injection water consequently makes permeability reductions due to srso4 baso4 precipitations in the pore space of reservoirs unavoidable especially collins et al 1966 1975 1980 emphasise the importance of the solubility properties of srso4 baso4 in rws furthermore the solubilities of baso4 and srso4 are significantly affected by the simultaneous presence and concentrations of cl hco3 ca2 and mg2 it should be mentioned that contents of 60 mg of baso4 l or 900 mg of srso4 l have been found in different rwls even though their solubility products would have been significantly exceeded herdhah and yassin 2009 astm international 2003 such phenomena must be considered not only during the production of oil and gas but also for the reinjection of treated rwd pw in oil and gas reservoirs as well as water circulation for geothermal projects it is assumed that earth alkali salts of low solubility interact in the presence of high cl concentrations and at elevated temperatures to binary compounds of raised solubilities such as zn so4 n 1cl2 z earth alkali atom n 2 also the reactions of earth alkali sulphates in oilfield brines of high cl concentrations to chloride bridged multicore complexes may be an explanation of their increasing solubilities with rising cl concentrations ion associates in nacl solutions at elevated temperatures and high pressures have been researched by classical molecular dynamics simulations sherman and collings 2002 those theoretical results seem to prove the existence of polyatomic clusters of nanclm n m in pure nacl brines oelkers and helgeson 1993 but an experimental prove in multi component systems like rwl is still outstanding most other anomalies in highly saline rwls at elevated temperatures pressures and different ph values have not been researched yet and are challenging to identify because the multitude of interdependencies in natural systems is quite complicated and still unknown likewise when flooding with micellar and or polymer solutions eor ior the salt content of the rwl and rwd pw as well as the type of salts are crucial to the effectiveness of these enhanced recovery methods high ca2 concentrations and the presence of even very low amounts of heavy metal ions borates and dissolved silicates may cause considerable problems i e precipitation gel formation extensive research by akstinat 1978 has demonstrated this issue in contrast to salt solubilities all gas solubilities in rwls decrease significantly as temperature and salt content increase furthermore the solubility of gases in rwl is strongly pressure dependent in equilibrium the solubilities of gases in rwl are proportional to their partial pressures rassenfoss 2017 4 6 ph the ph of rwl has a very high relevance too it is one of the most critical and sensitive parameters of a reservoir abdou et al 2011 depending on the salinity and the temperature the ph of rwl averages typically between 3 0 and 8 5 20 2 c referring to these values it must be assumed that most ph data of sub saline to super saline rwls stated in the literature are significantly too high because the ph is usually determined on rwd that is under standard conditions 1 bar 25 c all gases potentially influencing the ph and dissolved in rwl would have escaped almost entirely by then at reservoir pressures between 50 and 100 bar and reservoir temperatures from 40 to 60 c about 4 g of co2 already dissolve in 100 g water chapoy et al 2004 dodds et al 1956 wright 1963 fig 6 under these conditions the ph of this type of rw trends towards a constant value of around ph 3 0 at 6 bar already this value is likely also the prevalent ph in most acidic sub saline to super saline rwls crolet and bonis 1983 the significance of the ph stability of rwls is usually underestimated and neglected or completely disregarded abdou et al 2011 yang 2017 however any change of the original ph in a reservoir can lead either to pronounced precipitation or dissolution processes in addition to neutralisation processes e g with crude oil or natural gas constituents changes to the ph of rwl can trigger swelling processes of minerals uncontrollable gas formations sparingly soluble precipitations and unwanted degradation processes in a reservoir the temperature dependent ph of highly saline rwls seems to be very characteristic with values predominantly between 3 3 and 6 5 to achieve ph stability of a rwl or to use a pw rwd to be injected the simultaneous injection of co2 or the utilisation of an appropriate ph buffer would be necessary for acidic rwls a low ph in rwl or pw rwd can cause considerable corrosion damage to casings pipelines cement mantles and other production equipment but these damages can usually be remedied easily by selecting appropriate corrosion inhibitors or materials wright 1963a uncontrolled forced increases of the ph of rwl e g by waterflooding chemical eor processes may lead to significant changes in the chemistry of a reservoir and usually result in a distinct permeability decline of a formation especially close to injection wells mungan 1968 the gases dissolved in rwls are predominantly ch4 co2 n2 h2s collins 1980 and other lower hydrocarbons sulphate reducing bacteria frequently may cause later increasing h2s contents in rwl usually once contaminated a containment of bacteria in oilfield waters is quite cost intensive and partially successful only therefore pw rwds are either treated with chlorine dioxide clo2 or mixed with bactericides before injection as the temperature increases the ph and gas solubilities decrease as is usually the case in the gas analysis of produced reservoir water only the co2 and h2s contents are determined if anything since the co2 equilibrium is a decisive factor for the ph control of rwls it is vitally important to maintain the concentrations of co2 hco3 and co3 2 dissolved in rwls dodds et al 1956 hem 1967 fig 7 5 disposal concepts and environmental issues the disposal of rwds and pws causes considerable problems in certain countries veil et al 2004 regional environmental laws the concerns of citizens initiatives and lack of hydrochemical know how among the approval authorities frequently prevent the injection of rwd into depleted reservoirs or the use of rwd for waterflooding projects if the integrity of a borehole is verified natural products such as adequately treated ph adjusted rwd can usually be returned to their original location the reservoir without any problems however this is not the case for the injection of non isotonic waters with compositions that differ significantly from rwl such as freshwater or mixed production waters stimulation fluids and back flows of hydraulic fracturing processes liquid hazardous substances or brines originating from salt caverns salt mines in the light of those described above the compatibility of injection fluids with a rwl must be examined strictly in advance and have to be adjusted treated accordingly furthermore the significant differences between the above ground and down hole environment must be considered too reservoirs have their own very particular environment and differ significantly from the environmental conditions criteria above ground typical oil and gas reservoirs exhibit high ion exchange capacities or adsorption potentials which can fix or filter out hazardous substances permanently apart of the traditional water treatment of rwds pws and the established re injection of such waters into depleted horizons recently other alternatives for the economical disposal and or utilisation of rwds pws have become a subject of discussion rashid mir et al 2018 rassenfoss 2017 veil et al 2004 because of increasing disposal costs and other limitations jacobs 2016 something that was never seriously considered in the past that is now receiving attention is the pervasive economic use and clean disposal of rwds pws including stimulation fluids back flows and shale waters alzahrani and mohammad 2014 fakhru l razi et al 2009 padaki et al 2015 some waters may contain valuable mineral salts or could if appropriately treated be returned directly to the regular hydrological cycle the first facility for such a complete treatment of highly saline heavy metal and hydrocarbon containing rwds pws is operational in the united states the innovative clearwater facility company antero resources collects centrally and has been converting rwd pw into water that can be is permitted to be reused or introduced into the public sewer system or rivers without any problems the current daily treatment capacity of this new facility is 6400 m3 rwd or pw with a daily salt production of approximately 2000 t the salts thus obtained are intended to be used as de icing agents for roads for the chemical industry chlorine soda production in agriculture and water treatment facilities the processing of rwds pws with high lithium bromine and iodine contents could also be interesting from an economic point of view apart from such positive developments and considerations also negative disposal concepts are well known however it seems that in some oil gas producing countries depleted reservoirs are utilised as low cost dumping sites for any liquid wastewaters by ignoring the most critical physicochemical parameter of iso osmoticity taking this vital criterion not into account an injection of such waters including rwd pw can lead to significant problems in the united states the poorly regulated injection of rwd pw and fracturing wastewater loaded with a chemical mix into depleted reservoirs has raised public concerns for many years already numerous man made earthquakes have been reported mainly in texas kansas and oklahoma due to the uncontrolled disposal of the wastewaters of the oil and gas industry gernon 2018 rubinstein et al 2018 disregarding the osmotic pressure conditions during injection of non adjusted wastewaters into reservoirs with swellable clays i e montmorillonite kaolinite bentonite smectite or mixed clays with anhydrite interstratifications can have severe geomechanical consequences strong imbalances between the osmoticity of rwl and injection waters may trigger among others important interactions swelling processes within a reservoir these time temperature dependant swelling mechanisms and notable pressure increases result either in isostatic pressure adjustments land uplifts or in case of very structured reservoirs in underground or above ground seismic activities gernon 2018 those land uplifts and or man made earthquakes originating from an uncontrolled injection of rwd pw or fracturing waters in exploited reservoirs can depending on the overburden pressure depth create considerable damages on the earth s surface in general all these damages have to be compensated by the perpetrator polluter according to the national mining regulations subsidence damage by oilfield water disposal apart from osmometer measurements a prognosis of these specific seismic events is possible by joint interdisciplinary research work and exchange of reservoir data of hydrogeologists oilfield chemists and geomechanical specialists only a determination of the essential parameters for early predictions such as swelling pressure σ in mpa and swelling parameter α in are available through oedometer measurements on reservoir cores madsen 1979 another negative example of wastewater disposal is the injection of radioactive liquids into depleted reservoirs within the framework of nuclear energy production and scientific studies with radionuclides in research and medicine not insignificant amounts of liquids with usually low level to intermediate level radioactive wastes accumulate among other things this concerns tritiated water which typically contains a wide variety of additional radionuclides in a broad range of concentrations to dispose of these radioactive liquids various experts from the german rsk reactor safety commission and the ssk commission on radiological protection recommended an injection into abandoned depleted reservoirs tritium containing water obtained during reconditioning and waste treatment is to be injected into suitable formations of the deeper subsurface via wells from above ground anonymous 1977 the physicochemical background of this very critical and particularly dangerous disposal method was disregarded or not apparent to these carefree experts similar endeavours from the united states and the former ussr were named to bolster their rationale following known separation and enrichment methods chromatography reservoirs behave like huge separation columns chromatographic separation occurs in such porous media and at the same time dangerous zonal enrichments of individual radionuclides near injection wells may take place with the potentially inadequate borehole integrities of old boreholes and the predominantly long half lives of a variety of radionuclides the creation of an extremely high safety risk for drinking water resources cannot be excluded safe underground final storage of radioactive liquids in depleted reservoirs over the much discussed time of about one million years can be viewed as an illusion only because no generation can provide guarantees of safety over such extended periods 6 relevance of the chemical and physicochemical properties of rw pw on deep drilling technology and the oil and gas production interdisciplinary applied research on rws pws falls within the faculties of geochemistry hydrology and petroleum engineering oilfield chemistry however it is astonishing that this specific topic of oilfield chemistry has not found an adequate scientific home at western universities yet probably applied research on virgin rw is quite complicated due to their numerous variables and interdependencies as well as their expensive equipment for ambitious investigations at elevated temperatures and pressures most known high profile geochemical modelling and theoretical approaches performed under unrealistic conditions are lacking in practical relevance and cannot describe the properties of rwl under typical reservoir conditions helgeson et al 1993 furthermore research and investigations on a profit cutting product like rw pw are not promoted or sponsored by the relevant industries research activities are initiated if and only if severe production problems occur stricter governmental disposal regulations are introduced and disposal costs are escalating further despite their importance rws pws have rarely received the attention they necessarily deserve from petroleum engineers and geochemists in the fields of deep drilling technology oil and gas extraction or geothermal energy the focus of these industries was always oriented towards profitable and not on costly waste products and their disposal however neglecting this area may have significant short term impacts e g massive scale deposits and precipitations blockage of pipe systems al taq et al 2017 doscher and weber 1957 hofsäss and kleinitz 2003 tan et al 2017 veil et al 2004 due to inadequate treatment of the injection waters table 3 indeed pre assessments and compatibility tests could often be made through laboratory investigations al taq et al 2017 tan et al 2017 but ultimately an exact investigation of subsequent reservoir damages are rarely possible as long as rws pws are classified as inconvenient and costly by products of oil and gas production water treatments are pursued only half heartedly such short sighted behaviour of the industry could be excused only from that perspective because the insidious negative consequences of improper rw pw treatments typically become recognisable quite late often only after 5 10 years of injection e g as unknown pressure build up unfavourable oil water ratios when conducting treatment of rwds pws apparent cost cutting measures and lack of hydrochemical knowledge can force a premature abandonment of reservoirs many exhausted oil reservoirs would still be producing profitably today and their residual oil saturation would be significantly reduced if the rwl equilibria had been assessed early and adequately considered kramer 1968 lemcke and tunn 1956 6 1 origin of reservoir damages and production problems due to ignorance of the properties of rw pw the increased significance of the properties of rws for the relevant industries became apparent through an early in depth evaluation of hundreds of rw analyses of german oil and gas reservoirs akstinat 1978 an assessment of international published results and the negative impacts on the injection of poorly treated rwds pws krejci graf 1980 schröckenfuchs 1975 stober et al 2013 2014 as ascertained by the relevant elderly literature cited some basics of the chemical interactions and physicochemical properties of rws pws were already highlighted before 1980 by kleinitz 1976 1977 but have since internationally rarely taken account of rwls with their regionally very different compositions are one of the most chemically sensitive reservoir constituents even small deviations in the equilibrium of rwl are followed by drastic geochemical changes in a reservoir collins 1975 grimm 1962 kirk 1964 kramer 1968 lerman 1978 melrose et al 1976 mungan 1968 weinbrecht 2013 therefore the impact of injection water rwd pw are of primary importance for all waterflooding projects secondary oil recovery al taq et al 2017 fu et al 2012 hofsäss and kleinitz 2003 kleinitz 1976 mahmoud et al 2015 cold water injections waterflooding of untreated or incorrectly conditioned rwds pws may result in damage zones that extend from an injection well relatively far into a reservoir it must be emphasised that rwl has some small overlapping in chemical and physicochemical properties with seawater or near surface groundwaters only in most cases these waters are unsuitable for direct injection into reservoirs a coincidence of rwl with non adapted injection water e g seawater hot water steam flooding surface water of low salinity geothermal projects may result in minimally controllable but harmful side reactions and changes to the ph fig 8 shifting the ph of rwl through injection water to the more basic range always results in an increase in co3 2 ion concentration which may lead to severe precipitations and dissolution of silicates jones et al 1967 weres et al 1979 those silicates may precipitate later at undesirable locations within a reservoir grimm 1962 it should be noted that in acidic rwl ph 7 0 predominantly hco3 ions are present in the alkaline range ph 7 0 co3 2 ions prevail dubessy et al 2005 hem 1967 kleinitz 1976 see fig 7 eventually neither the overall geological nor the mineralogical classification of a reservoir are ultimately the determining factor for interactions with rwls instead the determining factor is exclusively the microscopic surface that is in direct contact with the rwl these capillary contact surfaces can deviate significantly from the overall geological mineralogical composition of a reservoir quite often capillary grain surfaces may be coated with swellable clays sulphates carbonates or na al silicates due to secondary mineralisation difference between inner and outer mineral composition therefore frequently used hydrological groupings based solely on geological data may not allow a pre classification of the original compositions of rwls if a reservoir also contains hydratable clays it may be possible to produce more oil by freshwater seawater flooding initially chillingar 1968 but flooding with fresh or low salinity water generally reduces the permeability due to clay swelling al taq et al 2017 fu et al 2012 hewitt 1963 mahmoud et al 2015 mungan 1968 clay swelling and precipitations of various heavy metal compounds in the pore space are generally accompanied by notable pressure changes in a reservoir particularly during injection of unbalanced pws rwds into a depleted reservoir horizon increased care must always be taken because undesirable conversion reactions of feldspars and clay minerals can occur causes of subsequent reservoir damages detected are widely misinterpreted and explained away as inhomogeneities of a reservoir classified incorrectly or shuffled off as the responsibility of previous generations of engineers blame culture there have been many attempts to repair reservoir damages through chemical treatment methods e g acidising emulsion breaking deflocculation but they usually appear to be successful in the short term and remain unsuccessful in the long term damaged zones can only rarely be permanently repaired by chemical stimulation methods coleman and mclelland 1994 dietzel and kleinitz 1989 hofsäss and kleinitz 2003 kleinitz et al 1976 1977 1998 tan et al 2017 only horizontal drilling that penetrates deep into a reservoir can potentially help to bypass previously damaged zones revive abandoned reservoirs and lead to renewed production 6 2 treatment of rw pw consequently a well planned water treatment program for rwd and pw is vitally crucial for transport injection and environmental issues betex contents can be reduced from several thousand ppm to residual oil contents of 1 ppm by membrane processes evaporators microfiltration mf ultrafiltration uf ceramic nanofiltration nf or reverse forward osmosis ro fo alzahrani and muhammad 2014 doscher and weber 1957 ebrahimi et al 2015 fakhru l razi et al 2009 hinners and themann 2015 padaki et al 2015 stripping of rwd with associated gases may be used to reduce the proportions of pah heavy metal contents e g fe2 mn2 salts can be reduced either by using specific ion exchangers zeolites or by introducing atmospheric oxygen and subsequent filtration through gravel sand bed filters kirk 1964 the use of reducing agents to prevent oxidation processes or complexing agents e g citric acid is not recommended because even though above ground problems are solved reversible dilution processes can again lead to precipitations in a reservoir the utilisation of co2 as a protective gas atmosphere in closed systems or a joint injection of co2 into with acidic rwd pw is beneficial as the circulation of pw during waterflooding is continued corrosion problems become increasingly more prevalent due to continuous o2 uptake usually rws and pws contain a series of corrosive components however dissolved oxygen exacerbates corrosion problems corrosion problems are increased additionally by the presence of co2 h2s dubessy et al 2005 and by sulphate reducing bacteria some oil and gas companies use wholly closed systems for the injection water most of these injection waters still contain up to 30 40 ppm fe2 to reduce the harmful effects of atmospheric oxygen inflow and precipitations sometimes reducing agents are added to injection waters in open systems whereby additions of hydrazine are supposed to have a favourable effect 7 conclusions considering the chemical and physicochemical parameters of rws and pws the following recommendations should be observed rwds pws shall be treated and transported in closed systems to prevent oxidation processes and precipitations co2 should be used as a protective gas for acidic rwds pws dubessy et al 2005 the ph of injection waters has to be adjusted to that of the rwl for a simple ph adjustment stabilisation simultaneous injection of co2 is recommended the necessary matching of the isotonicity iso osmoticity with the rwl can be achieved by increasing the salinity or diluting pws with fresh water all the concentrations of heavy metals especially of iron salts in rwds pws should be minimised before reinjection above ground complexing of heavy metal ions is discouraged bacterial contaminations of rwds pws have to be prevented or reduced a prophylactic metered addition of bactericides is recommended most critical discussions about harmful contamination of groundwater or drinking water resources by rwl rwd pw and or other injection liquids usually miss essential vital points quite often occurrences of non comparable near surface reservoir systems odd hydrological processes or human errors are used as hard hitting arguments to fear non specialists and the public scaring keywords i e health hazard human toxicology and carcinogenicity which are used as major objections on various methods used in the oil and gas industry or rwd pw disposal lose significance and environmental relevance upon closer scientific examination in general it can be said that all known environmental toxins and pollutants are already present in our immediate environment in more or less high concentrations presently because of advances in chemical analysis these toxin pollutant concentrations can be detected even in the pico femto range that applies not only for the analysis of drinking water but also for all reservoir constituents the presence of so called hazardous substances toxins in rwds pws etc does not automatically signal acute danger for humans or the environment already the old rule of the dose still applies today all things are poison and nothing is without poison only the dose makes a thing not a poison paracelsus 1589 consequential a measurable effect on humans e g a therapeutic or toxic effect is discernible only once a specific concentration limit is exceeded however this does not mean that a hazardous potential of a substance method should be trivialised or that it should not be warned against something that is rarely considered by concerned citizens or technology opponents is that no technical process can exclude all residual risks that is no less the case for procedures processes of the oil and gas industry declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that
